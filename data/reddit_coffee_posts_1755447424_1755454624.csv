Okay... is anyone familiar with how some autistic folks find it therapeutic to be wrapped up in something, and squeezed tightly? As that is what I'm hoping to maybe find from this post.

Essentially, there's a lot weighing on me lately. I'm dealing with chronic and worsening health stuff, I'm feeling disconnected from the city and local social communities (health stuff makes it hard to go out), and with a project I'm working on at the moment? It is definitely an overwhelming, and intimidating task, and honestly even if it is a passion project, I wonder if I bit off more than I could chew.

With all of this (and more) weighing on me... I'm sort of feeling this overwhelming urge to just be held, and squeezed. I mean, it is one of those things that has been known to bring comfort to many people who are on the autistic spectrum after all, including myself. And no, this isn't a ""hug"" like some people thought I meant on my last posts. To be honest, it doesn't even have to involve physical contact. I mean, just having me wrapped up in a blanket burrito, and being squeezed from the outside of the burrito would be much closer to what I'm hoping for out of this. 

Of course I'd absolutely love to cook you some food! We could watch a show, listen to music, talk (or not), and of course we could do the squeeze whenever you felt comfortable! The squeeze would ideally last for a few minutes, but that can be discussed. I just think it should be long enough that i can actually allow myself to relax into it. Ideally, we should talk online, and meet for a coffee first since something like this requires at least a bit of established trust. 

Honestly, I don't even know if posting this will yield anything. I'm nervous about even being this vulnerable with expressing a need like this. But hey, I've met some fabulous people on reddit before... so honestly? Why not?

If you are open to this concept, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk, and see what we can do from there! If you'd benefit from a good squeeze too, I can do the same for you!

A bit about me! I'm 26, non binary, living in Coquitlam (but can travel anywhere!). I'm neurodivergent (obviously), and have interests that range from music, art, and creativity, to transit, and horror! I love going out into nature sometimes, but I also enjoy staying in, and gaming too. I'm also trying to get into alternative fashion more!

For something like this, I probably would prefer to connect with other LGBTQ+ folks, and neurodivergent folks too. I do tend to be picky about the cis men I connect with, but I'm not opposed. Just please approach me with a message that actually shows you read this post, and DO NOT bring up, or even imply anything that is NSFW, otherwise I will block you! This act is meant to be platonic in nature. 

Anyways! I look forward to hearing from some people!

Also, to help show me you've read this post, please tell me your favourite types of music! ",1,1755454300.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Drinking a cold brew at 5pm is not usually a choice i would make but the day had been long and hard and i had even more work to do after the toddler was going to go to sleep, usually around 7pm. 

Our living room is a makeshift play room right now with a huge playpen (think rugrats size). our couch is in the playpen, a couch our son recently unlocked climbing on to by himself (this is important for later). anyway, i will sometime place our son into the ""cage"", as we call it, so i could run to the bathroom. i was peeing, it was less than two minutes. i come out of the bathroom to look my son in the eyes as he his holding my cold brew. 

""How did he get it"", you may ask, ""it shouldn't have been near him in the 'cage'"". it wasnt. it was outside the cage on a small, low to the ground show rack (there was a top on the rack we use to hold drinks or his sippy cups). i didnt even think he reach it, even if he could get on the couch, but alas he did. my son stole, and drank some of my cold brew. im not sure how much he drank, but when i attemped to lay him down at 7pm, he did not sleep. we ended up at a local college campus so he could run and play on some scultures to get his energy out, at 8:30 at night he was still going strong. did end up passing out around 10pm, but here's the moral of the story, hide your caffeine better.",1,1755454287.0,NewParents,0,1.0,False

**Coverage Type:** Retractable canopies, solid roofs, and louvered systems are different options for providing coverage.

So I bought some decent Vietnamese Robusta, some Honduran and some Guatemalan to blend in 30/50/80% amounts of robusta per blend. With the 80% being the smallest amount of coffee by weight as I doubt it’ll be very nice, but like I say, fun to try.

My quandary is - and I know the above doesn’t look very uniform - that the blend is grinding differently in the grinder. I’ll get some very fine stuff and then mostly coarser stuff. All on the same setting that obliterates most coffee to dust. I’m looking to ask how important is resting to grinding (I waited maybe 3.5 days before I ground these) and also whether I should give up roasting a blend and stick to roasting separately and blending separately.",1,1755454207.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

I began playing chess a while ago and I am very naturally bad at it, like most of us. I'm trying to actively practice and improve, and while I do play a lot of blitz I have also been trying to play more rapid and do lots of puzzles.

I notice that my play-style is pretty positional in normal chess and much more tactical in Fischer Random. I prefer tactics and every morning I enjoy some tactical puzzles with my coffee. This has caused me to be rated \~1200 in Fischer Random online and \~850-900 in standard in the same time controls. I find I have a lot of problems in the opening and often blunder material in standard chess in the first 15 moves. How can I get out of these opening problems and try to avoid memorization? I recognize that the Fischer Random may just be rating inflation, but I do significantly prefer it to the standard chess as well, if thats the case I still would like to get better at both.

I want to get into more tactical games and out of the opening more consistently. Any advice? I've been playing the Italian and the French as my primary openings in standard chess.

Thanks in advance!",1,1755454196.0,chessbeginners,1,1.0,False

**Parsing the Odds: A Mathematical Masterclass**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in cricket, math doesn’t lie (unlike a leg spinner’s googly). DraftKings has Australia as a heavy favorite at **1.44 decimal odds** (implied probability: **69.4%**), while South Africa sits at **2.75** (**36.4%**). At first glance, this looks like a mismatch. But hold your horses—those odds don’t account for Australia’s star all-rounder, **Mitchell Marsh**, who’s out with a hamstring injury he suffered *after tripping over his own shoelaces during a warm-up match*. Ouch.

Australia’s dominance in this series isn’t just about Marsh, though. Their batting lineup is as reliable as a cricket’s chirp at dusk, and their pace attack can bowl faster than a kangaroo in a hot rod. South Africa, meanwhile, relies on their spinners and the unpredictable bounce of their away-game luck. Historically, Australia has won **62% of ODIs** against South Africa since 2020, but injuries and home advantage skew that stat.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Spin, and a Coach Who Thinks Coffee Is a Sport**  
Australia’s injury list now includes Marsh, whose absence leaves a hole in their middle order and death-over bowling. Imagine a gourmet burger missing its secret sauce—still edible, but *boring*. To replace him, Australia’s coach has turned to **Jhye Richardson**, a pace bowler with a yorker that’s sharper than a well-timed sarcastic remark. Whether that’s a recipe for success? Only time (and possibly a Ouija board) will tell.

South Africa, on the other hand, has been bolstered by their spin trio: **Kagiso Rabada** (recovering from a minor shoulder tweak), **Andile Mathee** (a leg

  JESS  
  
  I should’ve known better. But I was an idiot. All it had ever taken from Hank was one pitiful bat of his eyelashes and a pout, and I came running. Well, not anymore. I’d forgiven him for becoming someone’s baby daddy. But there was only so much a girl could forgive.  
  
  Hank Granger had just screwed me over for the last time. I wasn’t one to be a doormat. My momma had taught me better than that. It was time I stopped letting our history play on my emotions. He was nothing close to being a real man. The boy I’d grown up loving had become a low-down good-for-nothing. He’d never settle down, and I was done letting him trample all over my heart.  
  
  He thought parking his pimped-out truck behind the bar was smart. The boy should know better than to think I wouldn’t know where to look. Jackass. I’d found him, all right. We were supposed to have gone out tonight. He had promised me dinner. A real date. But then he’d called two hours ago and canceled, saying he wasn’t feeling good. Being the dutiful girlfriend, I’d decided to make him some soup and take it over to him. Big surprise that he wasn’t there. Not really. I think deep down I’d known he was lying.  
  
  I stepped out of the trees I’d walked through for over a mile, and into the darkness of the back of the local bar, Live Bay. I didn’t want my truck to be seen here tonight, and it would be easier to run on foot into the darkness if I needed to make a fast getaway.  
  
  I gripped the baseball bat I’d borrowed from my cousin Rock two weeks ago when I’d had to go pick Momma up from work because her car wouldn’t start. Three in the morning outside a strip club wasn’t exactly safe. Momma kept a gun, but I didn’t have a clue how to use it. When I had asked her to teach me, she’d laughed and said that I’d end up shooting Hank’s balls off one night in a fit of rage and refused. Not because she cared for Hank, but because she didn’t want me in jail.  
  
  Feeling the weight of the bat in my hands, I smiled. This bad boy would do some serious damage. Then there was the knife in my pocket. The paint job was also going to hell, and if I had time, all four tires were going down.  
  
  As I walked around the truck that Hank had pampered and treated like a damn baby for the past four years, a sense of power ran through me. He’d hurt me over and over again. This time I was going to hurt him. Me. Not Rock. Me.  
  
  I checked the dark area around me and made sure no one was out here. The busting of the glass was going to make some noise. I wasn’t sure how much I could get away with before someone caught me. Hopefully, the local band, Jackdown, would keep everyone inside entertained enough that no one would leave anytime soon.  
  
  Biting back the roar of victory I could feel pumping through my veins, I held the bat back as I shifted my feet and focused on his driver’s side door window. It was going to be the first to go. With all the anger and pain that had consumed me since the first moment I’d found out the boy I’d loved since I was ten years old had been sleeping around on me, I swung the bat. The ski mask I was wearing protected my face. The laughter bubbling up in my chest burst free, and I continued to shatter every window on his pretty little truck.  
  
  High on revenge, I reached into my pocket and pulled out my knife and flipped it open. I decided to write a few choice words in the paint job with my sharp blade, then bent down to jam it into the front tire.  
  
  “Hey!” a deep voice called out, and I froze. It wasn’t Hank, but it was someone.  
  
  I picked my bat back up and pulled the knife out of the tire before breaking into a sprint back into the woods. He’d never catch me, but I still needed to get this stupid mask off so I could see. Running into a tree and knocking myself out wasn’t exactly a great getaway plan.  
  
  The sound of feet hitting the pavement let me know I was being chased. Well, shit. Not what I needed. I was having so much fun. Hank deserved that. He did. He was a rat bastard. I did not want to go to jail over this. Plus my momma would be pissed.  
  
  “Hey!” the deep voice called out again. What did he expect me to do? Stop and let him catch me? Not likely.  
  
  Other voices came from the distance. Great. He was drawing a crowd. I turned off the path I’d followed earlier and headed deeper into the woods. I wouldn’t have this cover for long. I’d be coming out onto a back road in a few more feet. I couldn’t get my truck because it was outside my momma’s house. I needed everyone to think that was where I was. I’d have to stay on foot and beat anyone there. Dang it.  
  
  I couldn’t hear the sound of anyone else’s feet hitting the ground, so either I’d lost them or they were talented in the art of stealth. Breaking out of the wooded area, I stopped on the side of the road. It was deserted.  
  
  Glancing back, I saw no one. Hank would know who to come looking for, but he would have no proof. Smiling, I took a deep breath. That would be the end of us. Finally. After what I’d done, Hank would never forgive me, so I wouldn’t be tempted to go running back to him. He’d hate me now as much as I hated him.  
  
  “JESS!” Hank’s familiar voice roared. Spinning around, I couldn’t see him, but I could hear him running through the woods behind me. Shit. Shit. Shit. He’d come after me. How’d he find out so fast? Panicking, I looked around to see where I could run to hide from him. There was nothing but miles and miles of road. No houses, nothing.  
  
  Headlights came around the corner, and I did the only thing I could think of: I ran out into the middle of the road and started waving my arms in the air, still holding on to Rock’s bat.  
  
  The car started slowing down and cut the bright lights. Thank God.  
  
  Wait . . . was that a Porsche? What the hell?  
  
  JASON  
  
  All I could see was a girl dressed in tight black clothing with lots of long blond hair, and she was standing in the middle of the road . . . holding a baseball bat. Only in Alabama did stuff like this happen. Stopping before I hit her, I watched as she ran over to the passenger-side door and knocked. The wild, panicked look in her eyes might have been disturbing if they weren’t a bright, clear blue with thick black lashes. I pressed the unlock button, and she jerked the door open and climbed inside.  
  
  “Go! Go! Go!” she demanded. She didn’t even look my way. Her eyes were focused on something outside. I turned my attention to the side of the road, where she was watching with such intensity. There was nothing. . . . Then a guy came bursting out of the woods with an angry snarl on his face and I understood. No wonder she was terrified. The guy was huge and looked ready to murder someone.  
  
  I shifted gears and took off before he got any closer.  
  
  “Oh my god, thank you. That was so close.” She let out a sigh of relief and leaned her head on the headrest.  
  
  “Should I take you to the police station?” I asked, glancing over at her. Had he attacked her before she’d gotten free?  
  
  “Definitely not. They’ll probably be looking for me in about ten minutes. I need you to take me home. Momma will cover for me, but I gotta get there quick.”  
  
  They’d be looking for her? Her mom would cover for her? What?  
  
  “It ain’t like he’s got any proof. The only thing I dropped was the ski mask, and it was a cheapo I bought at the Goodwill a couple of Halloweens ago. Not something he can trace back to me.”  
  
  I slowed the Porsche down as her words started sinking in. I hadn’t ju  
st saved a girl from being attacked. If I understood this babbling correctly, I had just become the getaway car driver.  
  
  “Why’re you slowing down? I need to get to my momma, like, now. She’s just two miles from here. You go up to County Road Thirty-Four and turn right, and then you take it about three-fourths of a mile to Orange Street and take a left. It’s the third house on the right.”  
  
  Shaking my head, I pulled over to the side of the road. “I’m not going any farther until you tell me exactly what it is I’m helping you escape from.” I glanced down at her baseball bat tucked between her legs, then up at her face. Even in the darkness I could tell she was one of those ridiculously gorgeous southern blondes. It was like the South had some special ingredient to raise them like that down here.  
  
  She let out a frustrated sigh and blinked rapidly, causing tears to fill her eyes. She was good. Real good. Those pretty tears were almost believable.  
  
  “It’s a really long story. By the time I explain everything, we’ll have been caught and I’ll be spending the night in jail. Please, please, please just take me to my house. We’re so close,” she pleaded. Yeah, she was a major looker. Too bad she was also bad news.  
  
  “Tell me one thing: Why do you have a baseball bat?” I needed something. If she’d knocked someone unconscious back there, then I couldn’t help her get away. They could be injured or dead.  
  
  She ran her hand through her hair and grumbled. “Okay, okay, fine. But understand that he deserved it.”  
  
  Shit. She had knocked someone out.  
  
  “I smashed all the windows in my ex-boyfriend’s truck.”  
  
  “You did what?” I couldn’t have heard her correctly. That did not happen in real life. Country songs, yes. Real life, no way.  
  
  “He’s a cheating bastard. He deserved it. He hurt me, so I hurt him. Now please believe me and get me out of here.”  
  
  I laughed. I couldn’t help it. This was the funniest damn thing I’d ever heard.  
  
  “Why’re you laughing?” she asked.  
  
  I shook my head and pulled back onto the road. “Because that’s not what I was expecting to hear.”  
  
  “What did you expect me to say? I’m carrying a bat.”  
  
  Glancing over at her. I grinned. “I thought you’d taken someone out with the bat.”  
  
  Her eyes went wide, and then she laughed. “I wouldn’t have knocked someone out with a bat! That’s crazy.”  
  
  I wanted to point out that smashing your ex-boyfriend’s truck windows and then running through the woods in escape at night was crazy. But I didn’t. I was pretty sure she wouldn’t agree.  
  
  “Right here, turn right.” She pointed up ahead of us. I didn’t bother putting on my blinker since no one was around us. “So, what’s your name? You look familiar for some reason, but no one I know around here drives a Porsche.”  
  
  Did I tell her who I was? I liked the privacy that Sea Breeze, Alabama, afforded me. I had a lot to think about over the next month, and making friends with the locals wasn’t on my agenda. Even if she was smoking hot.  
  
  “I’m not from around here. Just visiting,” I explained. That was the truth. I was here staying at my brother’s beach house while deciding on my next move.  
  
  “But I’ve seen you before. I know I have,” she said, tilting her head and studying me.  
  
  She’d figure it out soon enough. My brother was Jax Stone. He had become a teen rock star, but now that he was twenty-two he was a rock god. We looked similar. And the media loved to follow me around when they couldn’t get to Jax. While I loved my brother, I hated getting the attention. Everyone saw me as an extension of Jax. No one, not even my parents, cared about who I was as a person. They all wanted me to be who they expected.  
  
  “This is a Porsche, isn’t it? I’ve never seen one in real life.”  
  
  It was also one of my brother’s toys. I didn’t have a car here, so I just used the five he had in his garage. The house in Sea Breeze was where our parents used to make us spend our summers while Jax was juggling fame at a young age. But Jax was no longer a teenager and the house was his now. He’d turned twenty-two last month. And I’d turned twenty the month before that.  
  
  “Yes, it is a Porsche,” I replied.  
  
  “Turn here.” She pointed again toward the road ahead of us. I took the left and then came to the third house on the left. “This is it. Thank God no one is here yet. I gotta go. You need to get out of here so no one comes questioning you. But thank you so much.”  
  
  She opened the door and then glanced back at me one last time. “I’m Jess, by the way, and tonight you saved my ass.” She winked and closed the door before running off toward her front door. Her ass in those tight black jeans was worth saving. It was the nicest ass I’d ever seen.  
  
  I shifted the car into reverse and pulled back out onto the road. It was time I headed back to the private island where my brother’s house was. This night hadn’t turned out quite like I’d planned, but it’d been pretty damn entertaining.  
  
  The sound of something sliding across the seat and hitting the door startled me, and I glanced over to see the baseball bat. She’d forgotten it. I looked back at her house and smiled to myself. I’d be sure she got it back. Not tonight, but soon.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  JESS  
  
  I let the screen door slam behind me before I thought about it, then turned to lock it. Just in case Hank decided to take the law into his own hands. Not that I thought he was that stupid. He knew better than to screw with my momma.  
  
  “That you, Jess?” Momma called from the kitchen.  
  
  I might as well go tell her what I’d done. If the cops showed up, she needed to have her game face on. “Yeah, it’s me, and we might have some trouble,” I replied, walking through the small living room and toward into the kitchen. The five-room house I’d grown up in was cinderblock and nothing special, but the rent was affordable. No man had to help us get the bills paid. Momma had always taken care of things.  
  
  “What the hell have you done now?” Momma asked as I stepped into the kitchen. She was standing at the coffeepot with a cigarette between her red lips. Her favorite hot-pink satin robe was all she had on. She must have been getting ready for work and decided to stop and make some coffee.  
  
  I pulled out one of our vinyl-covered kitchen chairs and sat down. “I beat the shit out of Hank’s truck.”  
  
  Momma pulled the cigarette from her lips. “You did what?” she asked.  
  
  “He was at Live Bay with that whore he’s messing around with. He lied to me again. I’m done with him, and I wanted to make him hurt.”  
  
  Momma got rid of her ashes in the sink and, shaking her head, reached for a coffee cup. Her long blond hair was still pretty, but the face that had once been strikingly beautiful now showed hard lines from life. I was sure her smoking didn’t help things either. “Shit, girl. I need to go to work in an hour. What if the cops show up?”  
  
  I hadn’t thought of that. No alibi. I shrugged. “If they’re coming, maybe they’ll come before you leave.”  
  
  Momma took her coffee black and walked over to sit down across from me. “Did you at least get it good? If we have to deal with the poe poe, then you better have made it worth it. I ain’t in the mood for those bored shits tonight.”  
  
  I smiled, thinking about how good it had felt to see his pretty truck’s windows shatter. “Yeah, I think I got it good.”  
  
  Momma nodded and put her cigarette out, then took a sip of her coffee. “He’s a stupid, sorry-ass fucker who you need to stay away from. You’ve got a life ahead of you, and I’ll be damned if you end up like me. Hank’s already knocked up one girl he ain’t gonna marry. I sure don’t want you to be his next victim. This life ain’t easy, and you know it. You got the looks to buy you a life outta this. I intend for you to do it,” Momma said, leaning back in her chair and crossing her long legs.  
  
  This was a conversation we had been having since I was old enough to understand things. Which was since I was about nine. When your momma is a stripper in town, you learn things a lot sooner than other  
kids. There is no time for innocence.  
  
  “I’m done with Hank for good this time. I promise,” I assured her.  
  
  Momma didn’t look like she believed me. I couldn’t blame her. This thing with Hank had been going on for years. I really needed to let him go. He was a one-way ticket to the life I’d watched my mother live. As much as I respected her for not leaning on a man to take care of us, I didn’t want that life. I knew how much she hated it.  
  
  “My escape car was a Porsche,” I told her with a grin. I still couldn’t get over that car . . . and the guy in it. Way out of my league. Way, way out of my league. He was so wealthy he reeked of it. He also looked at me like I was a strange bird he didn’t know what to do with. I had probably scared the guy to death. He wasn’t from here. He was just visiting and would have gone back to whatever mansion he hailed from.  
  
  “Don’t see many Porsches around here,” Momma replied with a skeptical look on her face.  
  
  “He wasn’t a local. I imagine he’s vacationing on the island. He looked like one of those.”  
  
  Momma nodded. She knew all about those kind. I had been warned off two kinds of boys my whole life: the ones like Hank, who were “nothing but sorry shits,” and then guys from the island, who Momma said were “only after you for the sex and then they split.”  
  
  “Don’t worry about him, though. I’m pretty sure he thinks I’m a crazy person,” I assured her.  
  
  Momma raised her eyebrows and leaned on the table to look at me. “You really think that? I didn’t raise you to be so damn naive. He’s a man, baby. That’s all that matters. One look at you, and he’ll be back. You just be careful.”  
  
  I had tried to land more than one wealthy local in Sea Breeze, but that had never happened. Marcus Hardy had been in my sights from the time I was a little girl. He was my cousin Rock’s friend, but he was different than us. He lived in a big pretty house on the beach. But Marcus never saw me as anything but a fun time. When he laid eyes on Willow, no one else stood a chance. Now he was married with a kid and completely off-limits.  
“I should’ve pushed you to go off to college. You could have met someone there and gotten out of this place.” She said it like Sea Breeze was a bad place. I didn’t see it the same way she did. I loved the coastal town I had grown up in.  
  
  “I didn’t want to leave,” I reminded her. I had chosen to go to the local community college instead. I didn’t want to leave this town or my momma. We had been a team all my life.  
  
  Momma sighed and pushed her chair back and stood up. “I know, sugar. I let you stay because I like having you here. Still don’t make it right. Finding a man to get you out of this life is gonna be hard, and I’ll be damned if you fall into the life I’ve lived.”  
  
  I was starting to argue when someone banged on the door. Momma looked toward the front door, fluffed her hair, and pulled the neckline of her silk robe low enough to show her very impressive cleavage. “Go on and get in the shower. I got this, baby girl. Don’t worry ’bout a thing,” she said, slipping into a pair of red heels that only made her long legs longer. Smiling, I hurried to the bathroom and turned on the shower but kept my ear to the door.  
  
  “Well, hello, Officer Ben. You know I’m not the kind of girl who takes house calls,” she said in a low, sultry voice I had heard her use a million times.  
  
  “Good evening, Starla. I hate to bother you before you, uh . . . ,” He cleared his throat and I rolled my eyes. I already knew good old Officer Ben was a regular at Jugs, the strip club just on the outskirts of Sea Breeze. “. . . go to work. But I got a call about Jess, and I need to check into that. She here?”  
  
  “Not sure who called you, Ben,” Momma said, letting his name roll off her tongue as if she were about to strip just for him, “but my baby girl has been here with me all evening. She’s getting a shower now after helping me clean today. You can even check her truck hood—it’s cold. Hasn’t driven it all day long.” Momma paused, and I heard her heels click on the wooden floor as she stepped toward him. “And as much as I like the idea of you walking in on my showers, I don’t feel the same about you interrupting my little girl’s shower,” she said in a suggestive tone.  
  
  My momma was good at this.  
  
  “Uh, um, yes, I can, uh, understand that. Sorry I bothered you, Starla. Just had to check it out. There was only one person who saw her, and I’ll be sure to check out her truck before I leave, to let them know her alibi is airtight.” He stammered all over himself, and I covered my mouth to keep from laughing. He probably had a really good view of Momma’s boobs at the moment. She used them to get her way with the opposite sex, and it always worked.  
  
  He needed to see me so that he could verify I was at home. I jerked my shirt off, grabbed a towel, and wrapped it around me before opening the bathroom door a crack. Ben's eyes moved from their lustful gaze on my momma to me as I stuck my head out.  
  
  “Everything okay out there, Momma? I heard voices,” I called out, sounding as innocent as I could.  
  
  “Yeah, baby girl. It’s just fine. Just visiting with Officer Ben,” she replied flashing me a smile as she turned to look at me.  
  
  I closed the bathroom door just as Officer Ben apologized for bothering Momma again.  
  
  “That’s all right, Officer. You’re just doing your job and keeping our little town safe. Makes me sleep easier at night knowing we have brave, dedicated men like you taking care of us. That Martha sure is a lucky woman to have such a hardworking man like you coming home to her at night.”  
  
  I had to roll my eyes. The fact that men believed this stuff never ceased to amaze me. Ben had a beer gut and a balding head. Nothing about him was brave, and since I knew how much of his hard-earned money he spent at Jugs several nights a week, seeing my momma and the other women there dancing in nothing but tiny thongs, I didn’t believe Martha was lucky at all. Neither did my momma.  
  
  “Yeah, well . . .” He paused, swallowing so hard I could hear it from in here. “I’m glad it helps you rest easy. I do what I can. You, uh, gonna be at work tonight?”  
  
  “I’m getting all prettied up right now. You coming to see me? I hope you do. I might just have a special lap dance just for you,” Momma replied.  
  
  That made me want to gag. The idea that she could do that without throwing up in their faces blew my mind. She said she had learned a long time ago to turn off that switch in her head and remember that the better she performed, the more money she made.  
  
  “I’ll be there,” Officer Ben said. “Missed you last week due to an incident down at the station. Been thinking about that all week.”  
  
  “Glad to know I was in that head of yours,” she said sweetly.  
  
  “Always are,” Ben replied, and cleared his throat when he realized he was openly flirting with my almost naked Momma on the front doorstep. “I need to be going now and let them know Jess wasn’t involved.”  
  
  “You do that, and I’ll see you later,” Momma said, and her heels clicked as she stepped back from the doorway.  
  
  “Later,” Ben called out, and the door closed. I heard the latch click into place, and I turned off the shower and opened the door. All the doors in this house opened to the living room.  
  
  “Thank you,” I said simply.  
  
  Momma shrugged and waved her hand. “Just be glad it was Ben. He’s easy to work. If it had been David or Rooster, I’d have had to show them a lot more than some cleavage and leg to get them off your scent.  
  
  I nodded, and the guilt from forcing my momma to flirt with a married cop to get me out of trouble settled in my stomach. “I’m sorry,” I told her.  
  
  Momma stopped before walking into her room. “Don’t be. Someone needed to beat that shit’s truck up. I’m glad you did it.” Then she closed her bedroom door.  
  
  I stood there, and a smile tugged at my lips. I had never had many girlfriends in my life because no one understood me or wanted to get close to me. But my momma, she really was my best friend.  
  
  JASON  
  
  Two days later, I was still thinking about the truck-bashing blonde. She was something else. Hard to forget. I had her baseball bat standing in the corner of my room, and I was trying to decide what to do with it. I figured right now she didn’t need the evidence on her.  
  
  Chuckling, I shook my head. I was helping a girl get away with vandalism. That so wasn’t me. But it made me smile. Guess I needed a little action in my life. I intended to give it a few more days, then go see if I could catch her at home. I needed to give her back that bat, and I wanted to see her again. It was a good excuse.  
  
  I walked down the stairs in my brother’s summer house just as the front door opened and Jax and his girlfriend, Sadie, walked in. I had known they were coming down for the weekend, and I’d been expecting them.  
  
  Jax looked up at me and grinned. “Crashing your party.”  
  
  “You know me, it’s a wild one. Hope you can handle it,” I replied.  
  
  Jax shook his head and laughed. “Yeah, is it sad that I wish there was some truth to that.”  
  
  Sadie pinched Jax’s arm playfully before walking over to give me a hug. “Ignore him. I think you’re perfect just like you are. No need for wild parties.”  
  
  My brother’s girlfriend was beautiful in the head-turning kind of way. She had the kind of body and face you saw plastered on magazine covers. But Sadie was a small-town Sea Breeze girl and wanted nothing to do with the spotlight. She loved Jax and had learned to get over people splashing her face everywhere in the media, but before Jax she didn’t like drawing attention to herself. Which was impossible to avoid. The girl drew attention everywhere she went.  
  
  “Thanks, Sadie. You can drop the rock-star life anytime you want and come live the simple, ordinary one with me,” I told her, and winked at Jax, who was now scowling.  
  
  “Hands off, bro,” he said, reaching for Sadie’s arm. “Not funny.”  
  
  That never ceased to entertain me. Jax had never had insecurities. Even before he became famous, he was the most confident kid I knew. But let a guy look at Sadie, and he went all territorial. It cracked me up.  
  
  “Stop it, Jax. You’re being sil  
ly,” Sadie said, frowning at him and making him immediately look regretful. That was even funnier.  
  
  “Don’t be mad,” he said.  
  
  Sadie looked back at me. “You up for some company? I thought we’d have a little get-together tonight. I want to see everyone, and since we’re only here two days, it would be easier if we just had the gang here.” She beamed up at me.  
  
  Hell, Sadie wasn’t mine, but she was hard to say no to. I was pretty sure if she smiled at anyone, they’d do whatever it was she was asking. “Sure,” I replied.  
  
  Jax rolled his eyes at me, like he wasn’t a complete sucker when it came to her. What did he expect? I was a man. “I’ll go make sure the kitchen staff is prepared for the extra guests,” Jax told Sadie as he pressed a kiss to her cheek and started toward the kitchen.  
  
  “I already called and talked to Ms. Mary. She’s prepared,” Sadie called after him. Ms. Mary ran the staff and the kitchen here. Once, Sadie had worked for Ms. Mary, so she knew her well. That was how Jax had met Sadie. She served him dinner one night, and I’m pretty sure he was sunk then. Even though he fought it hard.  
  
  Jax stopped and turned around to give her the smile that magazines everywhere labeled as lethally sexy. “Then why don’t you help me to my room to unpack?”  
  
  I saw Sadie’s cheeks turn red, and she pressed her lips together to keep from smiling. “Okay, if you need help.”  
  
  Jax walked back over to her. “Lots of help. You have no idea how much help I need.”  
  
  “Either you two go to your room, or I’m going to throw ice water on you both,” I told them.  
  
  Sadie ducked her head, and Jax just grinned at me. “See you later,” he said as he held Sadie’s hand and led her up the stairs.  
  
  I decided going out to the beach and out of this house for a while was the best idea. Not sure how much “unpacking” those two planned on doing.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Five hours later, voices were getting louder downstairs as I stood in my bedroom, looking out over the front yard. I knew I needed to go downstairs. Jax would want me there. But those weren’t my friends. It wasn’t that I didn’t like them—I did. I just didn’t really know them. Then there was the matter of Preston Drake.  
  
  The dude was not a fan of mine. I had tried my hardest to get Amanda Hardy’s attention, only to lose her to Preston in the end. It’s hard to compete with bad boys with blond surfer hair. It wasn’t like I was in love with Amanda. Love wasn’t something I was looking for. Ever. She was just pretty and sweet. I liked that. It was easy with her.  
  
  A knock on my door brought me out of my thoughts, and I turned to see my brother standing there with his hands in the front pockets of his jeans. “You planning on hiding up here all night?”  
  
  I had considered it. I wasn’t great with people I didn’t know. I was on the quieter side. Jax was the personality in the family. “I was coming down in a minute.”  
  
  Jax cocked an eyebrow. “You look like you’d rather be anywhere else.”  
  
  I shrugged. “Not crazy about hanging out with people I don’t know that well. But I’m going to do it for Sadie.”  
  
  Jax walked into the room. “If you’re worried about Preston, don’t be. He’s really an easygoing guy.”  
  
  I chuckled. He hadn’t seen the side of Preston I had. “Trust me, he isn’t very easygoing when it comes to Amanda.”  
  
  “Maybe not. But he’s got her. They’ve been together long enough now that he feels secure. You were dating the woman he was in love with. I can understand his moment of insanity.”  
  
  Jax would. He had dealt with the same thing with Marcus Hardy. They were friends now. Because Marcus was married and had a kid, he no longer posed a threat to Jax. Amanda and Marcus are brother and sister, and Marcus worked at the house the same summer Sadie did.  
  
  “I’m coming down there,” I told him. “I swear. Besides, I’m hungry.”  
  
  “Good, because I suspect Sadie will be up here in the next five minutes if you don’t get down there. She’s worried about you feeling left out.”  
  
  I reminded myself that I was doing this for Sadie. “Let’s go,” I told him.  
  
  I followed Jax to the stairs and took in the crowd gathering in the foyer as Sadie opened the door again to let in more of her friends.  
  
  When I had been with Amanda at Marcus and Willow’s wedding, I had met several of them. They all seemed really nice, but Preston was one of theirs. I wasn’t sure just how well they would accept me. I left Sea Breeze on good terms with everyone after the wedding. It was easy to see who it was Amanda wanted. I didn’t even try to win her over. The girl’s heart was obviously owned by Preston.  
  
  Marcus Hardy walked in, holding a baby in a red-and-white blanket that looked like it had an elephant on it. Sadie squealed in delight and hugged Marcus’s wife, Willow, and then reached out to take the baby from Marcus. Two years ago that scene wasn’t something any of them would have imagined. Marcus had been determined to get Sadie’s attention, but he couldn’t compete with Jax. But then, no one ever could compete with my brother. I never dared to.  
  
  “I get him after Sadie,” Amanda’s voice called out just as I saw her walking into the room.  
  
  “You get him all the time,” Sadie told her, smiling down at the baby.  
  
  “He loves his aunt Manda,” Amanda cooed over the baby. I hadn’t seen Amanda since Marcus and Willow’s wedding. Her long blond hair was hanging loose down her back, and she was wearing a skirt that showed off her tanned legs. Preston walked up behind her and placed his hand possessively on her hip, and I froze. This might be a bad idea.  
  
  “I swear to you he’s over it,” Jax whispered beside me.  
  
  I nodded and started down the stairs toward the group. It wasn’t that I was scared of Preston—I just didn’t want to spend my night feeling like the unwanted guest. I was fine with not showing up to this thing.  
  
  “Cage and Eva are coming. They’re still getting used to life with a baby,” Willow told Sadie.  
  
  “I can’t wait to see Bliss,” Sadie said with a happy sigh.  
  
  Another baby? Damn, this group was multiplying like rabbits.  
  
  “She’s gorgeous,” Willow said. “I’m not kidding you. Like, stop-in-your-tracks gorgeous. Her little cheeks are so chubby, and her eyes are Cage’s. Eva can’t take her anywhere without being stopped by a million people to ooh and aah over her.” She smiled happily.  
  
  We reached the bottom step, and Sadie noticed us. She beamed brightly. I didn’t make eye contact with Amanda or even look in Preston’s direction. Instead I walked over to shake Marcus’s hand and congratulate him on the kid.  
  
  “Good to see you,” Marcus said, grinning at me.  
  
  “You too. Looks like you added another member to the family,” I replied. “Congrats.”  
  
  “Thanks. He’s keeping me up at night, but I’m okay with it. It’s a good time to talk football. Teaching him early.”  
  
  I laughed and turned to Sadie, who was holding the little guy out for me to see him. “Jason, meet Eli Hardy,” she said in a soft voice reserved for babies.  
  
  “Nice to meet you, Eli,” I replied. The kid smiled and stuck his hand in his mouth. The little fluff of hair on his head was as red as his mother’s, but the kid reminded me of Marcus. Maybe it was his eyes.  
  
  “I’m hungry. We gonna stand around and look at babies all night, or is there food here?” a new voice said, drawing my attention from the baby. I recognized him, but I couldn’t remember his name. He had his dreadlocks pulled back in a ponytail. Tattoos decorated most of his arms, and he even had one coming up his neck. I didn’t stare long enough to figure out what it was. His lip was pierced, and when he talked you could see the metal in his mouth.  
  
  “We have plenty of food, Dewayne,” Sadie replied, smiling at him like he wasn’t a scary-ass dude.  
  
  “Good,” he said, walking over and stopping to kiss Eli’s head, which was not what I was expecting him to do. “Damn, that kid’s cute. But then, he looks like his momma.”  
  
  Marcus just chuckled.  
  
  Dewayne l  
ooked over at me and stopped. His gaze shifted from me to where I knew Amanda and Preston stood behind me. A slow grin stretched across his face. “Hell yeah. This should be a shit ton of fun. Preston, you gonna play nice with Jason?”  
  
  Sadie’s eyes went wide, and everyone went quiet. I decided now was a good time to turn and address them and get this over with.  
  
  Amanda was glaring at Dewayne like she was about to take a swing at him, but Preston had an amused grin on his face. “I always play nice,” Preston said with a lazy drawl that went well with his surfer-boy appearance. “I got no problem with Jason. At least not anymore.” He dropped his arm from around Amanda’s waist, stepped forward, and held out his hand to me. “No hard feelings,” he said.  
  
  The guy was hard to dislike. I shook his hand. “Not at all,” I replied.  
  
  “Good,” he said, stepping back to put his hand back on Amanda. “See, dickhead? We’re all good,” Preston said to Dewayne.  
  
  Dewayne just chuckled and shook his head. “Sure you are.”  
  
  “Okay, Dewayne, don’t go getting everyone all stirred up. We’re at the Stones’ house,” Marcus said, trying to sound diplomatic.  
  
  Dewayne shrugged and glanced back at Marcus. “Just having some fun.”  
  
  The doorway was filled again, this time with the massive brick wall that was Rock. A little girl with a head full of curls ran around his legs, squealing Preston’s name. I turned to see Preston reach down and grab her just as she flung herself into his arms. Rock and his wife, Trisha, had adopted Preston’s little sister and brothers when their mother passed away, making this group of friends even tighter.  
  
  “I missed you,” the little girl said, planting a loud, smacking kiss on Preston’s cheek.  
  
  “I missed you, too,” he said.  
  
  “Sorry we’re late,” Rock said. “Trisha is bringing the boys after football practice. I had to go get Daisy. Jess was watching her at the house while we were at the boys’ practice.  
  
  My head snapped around at the name Jess. The name of the girl I’d rescued the other night.

1msxyaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1msxyaz/ssri_induced_gastritis/,SSRI induced gastritis,"Just wanted to express my excitement/hope that my gastritis will be relieved in the next 2-3 months. Endoscopy showed mild chronic inactive gastritis (no h pylori) in April 2024.

Symptoms: severe chest pain radiating into the left upper side of my back (debilitating my entire left side via pain and weakness, even sneezing was painful, shortness of breath, my sinuses on the left side only would get congested-specifically and often after eating gluten. no celiac, no allergy, just a temporary sensitivity…

Saw a cardiologist, pulmonologist, 2 gastrointestinal doctors, ER x 2, urgent care, primary care doctor, immunologist…no answers, just given PPIs which i take 4x/day. I take pepzin GI zinc l carnosine which someone here recommended to me and has helped. probiotics, papaya enzymes, papaya concentrate.  

No coffee, no alcohol, no soda, no spicy foods. 

Random foods I can’t eat: chocolate, watermelon, beans (i’m vegan so not the best), eggplant, cashews (the best for cheesy sauce replacements), oreos regular and vanilla, sugar, 
Luckily I’ve been able to manage my diet to limit my flare ups which have been minimal. Low fodmap seems to help. Going gluten free helped immensely. But gastritis still lingers… 

The culprit, based on my own experiences and that of at least 4 other redditors that have posted here *drum roll please!* ….Zoloft/Sertraline/SSRI.

I increased my dose in early 2024 I think, which I did not connect originally. At the end of 2024, I increased again and noticed worsening symptoms. Cut back the second increase which I think helped slightly. The other redditors said once they stopped taking it within a month their symptoms improved. I’m hoping when I return to my baseline dose, it disappears like it never existed!! 

I hope maybe this information can help someone else. Wishing you all many moments free of pain today.

I know that these threads have been done before, but I really enjoy reading other player's experience with LaDS.

So I was talking with another player in a comment thread about how happy it makes us to see how LaDS has had a positive impact on players in real life. From realising that you were in a bad relationship to how you found even the slightest bit of support in the game. That moment when the thought runs through your head that ""Zayne/Xavier/Rafayel/Sylus/Caleb would never!"" is so powerful. I mean, the memory card where Rafayel threw pebbles at MC's stalker or when Caleb went all out against Viper in the main story? Imagining how one of the LIs would treat you better than whatever is happening to you right now, is so empowering in deciding to put yourself first or finally allowing yourself to be kinder to yourself.

For me there have been many times when I experienced so many happy emotions from playing LaDS. Sometimes it was just the distraction I needed or my happy place when I had to escape reality for just a little bit. It may be small, but there were times when hearing their gentle voice or jokes really helped me get through the day. For example, I really treasure Sylus's phone call 'As you wish' because these were exactly the words that I needed in my past relationships, but never got. Just someone who let's you be you and walks right next to you. And there are many more dialogues in the game that are soothing or healing. Even if it brightens your day for just a little, it can mean the world. 

Btw a special shoutout to the voice actors who bring these characters to life (together with the whole team behind it). They invested a lot of time and money in their training to be able to do voice acting gigs. On top of that they need to work one or two more jobs next to voice acting. If only they knew how voicing these characters puts a smile on so many people's faces, even for a little. I thank them from the bottom of my heart, truly. 

Anywho, I love reading stories from players about how LaDS impacted their life, big or small. From finding little ways to motivate you to ""do the thing"", to getting to a better place mentally or just smiling at your screen over your morning cup of coffee (that would be me). 

So I welcome you to share your story, I love reading them! ♡",4,1755453871.0,LoveAndDeepspace,0,1.0,False

Stories drifted to the new neighbors that recently moved in next to her (my previous house), a young couple. My friend here seems to be grossed out by how the lady does everything(home chores) while the guy is a 'working from home' type. ""Mimi nimfulie nguo?"", she could not hide the distaste.

Dont misquote me, I am not the type that thinks its women work to do the house chores, ziih, I believe in equal rights!! But I love women who thinks its their duty. Lol.

This lady friend of mine, she is beautiful, A-type personality, she has values and she is the most hardworking woman I know and she is single, in her late 20's. Amejaribu dating sites and all but she can't seem to find her match. With a little digging,uou will find that she likes her freedom too much, she hates sharing her bathroom(it's gross), she doesn't want to have kids and dislikes the idea of wifely duties (to her, its some sort of control). As much as she craves to have a man of her own, she subconsciously hate the idea. At times I pity her. I am pretty sure, ata apate Mr. Right, she will find a reason to sabotage it (subconsciously) just to remain single and have all the freedom that she believes comes with it. 

We have all come across this type of men who are also bitter about women, in their social media feeds, hautakosa the likes of Amerix and Kibe. The kind of men who thinks a woman is the unwanted skin sorrounding the vagina lol.Although pia would like to have a good woman in their lives, but the beliefs they have and the mentality does not support it. 

People fight effects while deep down they harbor and cherish the cause (cause and effect). People keep chasing  something that seems unattainable, its a high time to check the beliefs you have or else you will be running but going nowhere (like a treadmill)",1,1755453692.0,Kenya,3,1.0,False

My name is Morgan and I use she/her pronouns. I am 18. 

I’m looking for someone to build a little world in the 70s/80s with. This would be a slow burn  kinda thing with my oc, Azrael. Azrael is a theistic satanist and is a diesel mechanic, he works on trains. He is also 28 in most timelines, unless it’s a childhood friends to lovers slow burn plot (I’d love to do that kinda thing too!)

Here’s just something I’m going for:

Your character can be a ghost, a fellow railroad mechanic, or really whatever you choose. Azrael is gay (yes I know in those times it was hard to come out but idc), so this would be a plot with another male oc obviously. 

This would take place in the 70s. Azrael is an alternative fashioned guy, so that’s also something. I have all of his info in a google doc that I can provide in DMs. We can work out actual details of the plot in DMs, too.

Plot idea:

As mentioned, Childhood friends to lovers: your OC is a friend of Azrael’s. Your OC has been there for Azrael and has stood up for him when he’s been bullied, even though Azrael can mostly handle it himself. Something could happen; maybe your oc is drafted into a war, your OC moves or it’s just a case of drifting apart. Somehow, they reunite. Whether it’s at a coffee shop, the trainyard where Az works, etc, they reunite. At first, they don’t recognize each other- but they share a familiar feeling, a feeling of being truly home.

This is just an idea, we can always work together on a plot, but I would like it to be a romance plot with other elements added in too so it’s not entirely the main focus. 

Rules: 

18+ only. 

Do not control me/my character 


If you’re not liking something, tell me! I am open to other ideas and I won’t be mad if you tell me you’re not liking something I’m doing or something that’s happening in the plot. 


Write in 3rd person, past tense. Please.


Semi-Lit+ writing only. At least a paragraph response!

This will be SFW ONLY. 


Do not come into my DMs with “hey” or “wanna rp”. Please introduce yourself- just give me your name/nickname/alias/what you want me to call you OOC, your age and a fun fact about you.

This will be a roleplay on discord. 

That should be all, DM if interested. Thanks!

  We didn’t notice right away. We couldn’t feel it.  
  
  We did not sense at first the extra time, bulging from the smooth edge of each day like a tumor blooming beneath skin.  
  
  We were distracted back then by weather and war. We had no interest in the turning of the earth. Bombs continued to explode on the streets of distant countries. Hurricanes came and went. Summer ended. A new school year began. The clocks ticked as usual. Seconds beaded into minutes. Minutes grew into hours. And there was nothing to suggest that those hours, too, weren’t still pooling into days, each the same fixed length known to every human being.  
  
  But there were those who would later claim to have recognized the disaster before the rest of us did. These were the night workers, the graveyard shifters, the stockers of shelves, and the loaders of ships, the drivers of big-rig trucks, or else they were the bearers of different burdens: the sleepless and the troubled and the sick. These people were accustomed to waiting out the night. Through bloodshot eyes, a few did detect a certain persistence of darkness on the mornings leading up to the news, but each mistook it for the private misperception of a lonely, rattled mind.  
  
  On the sixth of October, the experts went public. This, of course, is the day we all remember. There’d been a change, they said, a slowing, and that’s what we called it from then on: the slowing.  
  
  “We have no way of knowing if this trend will continue,” said a shy bearded scientist at a hastily arranged press conference, now infamous. He cleared his throat and swallowed. Cameras flashed in his eyes. Then came the moment, replayed so often afterward that the particular cadences of that scientist’s speech—the dips and the pauses and that slight midwestern slant—would be forever married to the news itself. He went on: “But we suspect that it will continue.”  
  
  Our days had grown by fifty-six minutes in the night.  
  
  At the beginning, people stood on street corners and shouted about the end of the world. Counselors came to talk to us at school. I remember watching Mr. Valencia next door fill up his garage with stacks of canned food and bottled water, as if preparing, it now seems to me, for a disaster much more minor.  
  
  The grocery stores were soon empty, the shelves sucked clean like chicken bones.  
  
  The freeways clogged immediately. People heard the news, and they wanted to move. Families piled into minivans and crossed state lines. They scurried in every direction like small animals caught suddenly under a light.  
  
  But, of course, there was nowhere on earth to go.  
  
  2  
  
  The news broke on a Saturday.  
  
  In our house, at least, the change had gone unnoticed. We were still asleep when the sun came up that morning, so we sensed nothing unusual in the timing of its rise. Those last few hours before we learned of the slowing remain preserved in my memory—even all these years later—as if trapped behind glass.  
  
  My friend Hanna had slept over the night before, and we’d camped out in sleeping bags on the living room floor, where we’d slept side by side on a hundred other nights. We woke to the purring of lawn-mower motors and the barking of dogs, to the soft squeak of a trampoline as the twins jumped next door. In an hour we’d both be dressed in blue soccer uniforms—hair pulled back, sunscreen applied, cleats clicking on tile.  
  
  “I had the weirdest dream last night,” said Hanna. She lay on her stomach, her head propped up on one elbow, her long blond hair hanging tangled behind her ears. She had a certain skinny beauty that I wished I had too.  
  
  “You always have weird dreams,” I said.  
  
  She unzipped her sleeping bag and sat up, pressed her knees to her chest. From her slim wrist there jingled a charm bracelet crowded with charms. Among them: one half of a small brass heart, the other half of which belonged to me.  
  
  “In the dream, I was at my house, but it wasn’t my house,” she went on. “I was with my mom, but she wasn’t my mom. My sisters weren’t my sisters.”  
  
  “I hardly ever remember my dreams,” I said. Then I got up to let the cats out of the garage.  
  
  My parents were spending that morning the way I remember them spending every morning, reading the newspaper at the dining room table. I can still see them sitting there: my mother in her green bathrobe, her hair wet, skimming quickly through the pages, while my father sat in silence, fully dressed, reading every story in the order it appeared, each one reflected in the thick lenses of his glasses.  
  
  My father would save that day’s paper for a long time afterward—packed away like an heirloom, folded neatly beside the newspaper from the day I was born. The pages of that Saturday’s paper, printed before the news was out, report a rise in the city’s real estate prices, the further erosion of several area beaches, and pl  
ans for a new freeway overpass. That week a local surfer had been attacked by a great white shark; border patrol agents discovered a three-mile-long drug-running tunnel six feet beneath the U.S./Mexico border; and the body of a young girl, long missing, was found buried under a pile of white rocks in the wide, empty desert out east. The times of that day’s sunrise and sunset appear in a chart on the back page, predictions that did not, of course, come to pass.  
  
  Half an hour before we heard the news, my mother went out for bagels.  
  
  I think the cats sensed the change before we did. They were both Siamese, but different breeds. Chloe was sleepy and feathery and sweet. Tony was her opposite: an old and anxious creature, possibly mentally ill, a cat who tore out his own fur in snatches and left it in piles around the house, tiny tumbleweeds set adrift on the carpet.  
  
  In those last few minutes, as I ladled dry food into their bowls, the ears of both cats began to swivel wildly toward the front yard. Maybe they felt it somehow, a shift in the air. They both knew the sound of my mother’s Volvo pulling into the driveway, but I wondered later if they recognized also the unusually quick spin of the wheels as she rushed to park the car, or the panic in the sharp crack of the parking brake as she yanked it into place.  
  
  Soon even I could detect the pitch of my mother’s mood from the stomps of her feet on the porch, the disorganized rattle of her keys against the door—she had heard those earliest news reports, now notorious, on the car radio between the bagel shop and home.  
  
  “Turn on the TV right now,” she said. She was breathless and sweaty. She left her keys in the teeth of the lock, where they would dangle all day. “Something God-awful is happening.”  
  
  We were used to my mother’s rhetoric. She talked big. She blustered. She overstated and oversold. God-awful might have meant anything. It was a wide net of a phrase that scooped up a thousand possibilities, most of them benign: hot days and traffic jams, leaking pipes and long lines. Even cigarette smoke, if it wafted too close, could be really and truly God-awful.  
  
  We were slow to react. My father, in his thinning yellow Padres T-shirt, stayed right where he was at the table, one palm on his coffee cup, the other resting on the back of his neck, as he finished an article in the business section. I went ahead and opened the bag of bagels, letting the paper crinkle beneath my fingers. Even Hanna knew my mother well enough to go right on with what she was doing—hunting for the cream cheese on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator.  
  
  “Are you watching this?” my mother said. We were not.  
  
  My mother had been an actress once. Her old commercials—mostly hair-care and kitchen products—lay entombed together in a short stack of dusty black videotapes that stood beside the television. People were always telling me how beautiful she was when she was young, and I could still find it in the fair skin of her face and the high structure of her cheekbones, though she’d gained weight in middle age. Now she taught one period of drama at the high school and four periods of history. We lived ninety-five miles from Hollywood.  
  
  She was standing on our sleeping bags, two feet from the television screen. When I think of it now, I imagine her cupping one hand over her mouth the way she always did when she worried, but at the time, I just felt embarrassed by the way the black waffle soles of her running shoes were twisting Hanna’s sleeping bag, hers the dainty cotton kind, pink and polka-dotted and designed not for the hazards of campsites but exclusively for the plush carpets of heated homes.  
  
  “Did you hear me?” said my mother, swinging around to look at us. My mouth was full of bagel and cream cheese. A sesame seed had lodged itself between my two front teeth. “Joel!” she shouted at my father. “I’m serious. This is hellacious.”  
  
  My father looked up from the paper then, but still he kept his index finger pressed firmly to the page to mark his place. How could we have known that the workings of the universe had finally made appropriate the fire of my mother’s words?  
  
  3  
  
  We were Californians and thus accustomed to the motions of the earth. We understood that the ground could shift and shudder. We kept batteries in our flashlights and gallons of water in our closets. We accepted that fissures might appear in our sidewalks. Swimming pools sometimes sloshed like bowls of water. We were well practiced at crawling beneath tabletops, and we knew to beware of flying glass. At the start of every school year, we each packed a large ziplock bag full of non-perishables in case The Big One stranded us at school. But we Californians were no more prepared for this particular calamity than those who had built their homes on more stable ground.  
  
  When we finally understood what was happening that morning, Hanna and I rushed outside to check the sky for evidence. But the sky was just the sky—average, cloudless, blue. The sun shone unchanged. A familiar breeze was blowing from the direction of the sea, and the air smelled the way it always did back then, like cut grass and honeysuckle and chlorine. The eucalyptus trees fluttered like sea anemones in the wind, and my mother’s jug of sun tea looked nearly dark enough to drink. In the distance beyond our back fence, the freeway echoed and hummed. The power lines continued to buzz. Had we tossed a soccer ball into the air, we might not have even noticed that it fell a little faster to the earth, that it hit the ground a little harder than before. I was eleven years old in the suburbs. My best friend was standing beside me. I could spot not a single object out of place or amiss.  
  
  In the kitchen, my mother was already scanning the shelves for essentials, swinging cupboards on hinges and inspecting the contents of drawers.  
  
  “I just want to know where all the emergency supplies are,” she said. “We don’t know what might happen.”  
  
  “I think I should go home,” said Hanna, still in purple pajamas, her arms wrapped around her tiny waist. She hadn’t brushed her hair, and hers was hair that demanded attention, having grown uncut since second grade. All the Mormon girls I knew had long hair. Hanna’s dangled near her waist and tapered at the end like a flame. “My mom is probably freaking out, too,” she said.  
  
  Hanna’s house was crowded with sisters, but mine was the home of only one child, and the rooms always felt too quiet without her. I never liked to see her go.  
  
  I helped her roll up her sleeping bag. She packed her backpack.  
  
  Had I known how much time would pass before we’d see each other again, I would have said a different goodbye. But we just waved, Hanna and I, and then my father drove her back to her house, three streets over from ours.  
  
  There was no footage to show on television, no burning buildings or broken bridges, no twisted metal or scorched earth, no houses sliding off slabs. No one was wounded. No one was dead. It was, at the beginning, a quite invisible catastrophe.  
  
  I think this explains why what I felt first was not fear but a thrill. It was a little exciting—a sudden sparkle amid the ordinary, the shimmer of the unexpected thing.  
  
  But my mother was terrified. “How could this happen?” she said.  
  
  She kept clipping and reclipping her hair. It was dark and lovely, thanks in part to a deep brown dye.  
  
  “Maybe it was a meteor?” I said. We’d been studying the universe in science, and I’d memorized the order of the planets. I knew the names of all the things that floated out in space. There were comets and black holes and bands of giant rocks. “Or maybe a nuclear bomb?”  
  
  “It’s not a nuclear bomb,” said my father. I could see the muscles clenching in his jaw as he watched the television screen. He kept his arms crossed, his feet spread wide. He would not sit down.  
  
  “To a certain extent, we can adapt,” a scientist on the television screen was saying. A tiny microphone had been pinned to his collar, and a newscaster was plumbing him for the darker possibilities. “But if the earth’s rotation continues to slow—and this is just speculation—I’d say we can expect radical changes in the weather. We’re going to see earthquakes and tsunamis. We might see mass plant and animal die-outs. The oceans may begin to shift toward the poles.”  
  
  Behind us, our vertical blinds rustled in t  
he breeze, and a helicopter buzzed in the distance, the thrumming of its blades wafting into the house through the screens.  
  
  “But what could possibly cause something like this?” said my mother.  
  
  “Helen,” said my father, “I don’t know any more than you do.”  
  
  We all forgot about that day’s soccer game. My uniform would remain folded in a drawer all day. My shin guards would lay untouched at the bottom of my closet.  
  
  I heard later that only Michaela showed up at the field, late as usual, her cleats in her hands, her long hair undone, her red curls flying in and out of her mouth as she ran sock-footed up the hill to the field—only to find not a single girl warming up, not one blue jersey rippling in the wind, not one French braid flapping, not a single parent or coach on the grass. No mothers in visors sipping iced tea, no fathers in flip-flops pacing the sideline. No ice chests or beach chairs or quarter-sliced oranges. The upper parking lot, she must have noticed then, was empty of cars. Only the nets remained, billowing silently in the goals, they the only proof that the sport of soccer had once been played on this site.  
  
  “And you know how my mom is,” Michaela would tell me days later at lunch, slouching against a wall in imitation of the sexier seventh-grade girls. “She was gone by the time I got back down to the parking lot.”  
  
  Michaela’s mother was the youngest mother. Even the most glamorous of the other mothers were at least thirty-five by then, and mine had already turned forty. Michaela’s was just twenty-eight, a fact that her daughter denied but we all understood to be true. Her mother always had a different boyfriend at her side, and her smooth skin and firm body, her high breasts and her slim thighs, were together the source of something shameful we only dimly perceived but which we most certainly did perceive. Michaela was the only kid I knew who lived in an apartment, and she had no father to speak of.  
  
  Michaela’s young mother had slept right through the news.  
  
  “You didn’t see anything about it on television?” I asked Michaela later in the week. We don’t have cable, remember? I never even turn the TV on.”  
  
  “What about the car radio?”  
  
  “Broken,” she said.  
  
  Even on ordinary days, Michaela had a continuous need for rides. On that first day of the slowing, while the rest of us watched the news in our living rooms, Michaela, stranded at the soccer field, fiddled for a while with an ancient, out-of-service pay phone, long forgotten by its maker—all the rest of us had cell phones—until finally the coach drove up to tell anyone who had shown up that the game was canceled, or at least postponed, and he gave Michaela a ride home.  
  
  By noon on that first day, the networks had run out of new information. Drained of every fresh fact, they went right on reporting anyway, chewing and rechewing the same small chunks of news. It didn’t matter, we were mesmerized.  
  
  I spent that whole day sitting on the carpet, only a few feet from the television with my parents. I still remember how it felt to live through those strange hours. It was almost physical: the need to know whatever there was to know.  
  
  Periodically, my mother went around the house checking faucets one by one, inspecting the color and clarity of the water.  
  
  “Nothing’s going to happen to the water, honey,” said my father. “It’s not an earthquake.”  
  
  He held his glasses in his hands and was wiping the lenses with the bottom of his shirt, as if ours were a problem merely of vision. Bare of the glasses, his eyes always looked squinty to me, and too small.  
  
  “You’re acting like this isn’t a big deal,” she said.  
  
  This was a time when the disagreements between my parents were still minor.  
  
  My father held his glasses up to the light, then carefully set them on his face. “Tell me what you want me to do, Helen,” he said. “And I’ll do it.”  
  
  My father was a doctor. He believed in problems and solutions, diagnosis and cure. Worry, to his mind, was a waste.  
  
  “People are panicking,” said my mother. “What about all the people who run the water systems and the power grid? What about the food supply? What if they abandon their posts?”  
  
  “All we can do is ride this thing out,” he said.  
  
  “Oh, that’s a good plan,” she said. “That’s a really excellent plan.”  
  
  I watched her hurry out to the kitchen, her bare feet slapping the tile. I heard the click and creak of the liquor cabinet, the clinking of ice in a glass.  
  
  “I bet things will turn out okay,” I said, gripped by an urge to say some cheerful thing—it rose up from my throat like a cough. “I bet it will be fine.”  
  
  Already the crackpots and the geniuses were streaming out of the wilderness and appearing on talk shows, waving the scientific papers that the established journals had declined to publish. These lone wolves claimed to have seen the disaster coming.  
  
  My mother returned to the couch with a drink in her hand.  
  
  At the bottom of the television screen, a question blared in red block letters. This was the question: is the end near?  
  
  “Oh, come on,” said my father. “That’s just pure sensationalism. What are they saying on public television?” The question dissolved in the air. No one changed the channel. Then he looked over at me and said to my mother, “I don’t think she should be watching this. Julia,” he said, “you want to go kick the ball around?”  
  
  “No, thanks,” I said. I didn’t want to be outside. I didn’t want to miss a single piece of news.  
  
  I had pulled my sweatshirt down over my knees. Tony lay beside me on the rug, his paws outstretched, his breathing wheezy. His body was so bony, you could see the knobs in his spine. Chloe was hiding under the couch.  
  
  “Come on,” said my father. “Let’s go kick the ball around for a while.” He dug my soccer ball out of the hall closet and pressed it between his hands. “It feels a little low,” he said.  
  
  I watched him handle the pump as if it were a piece of his medical equipment, inserting the needle into the opening with a surgeon’s precision and care, then pumping methodically, like a respirator, always waiting for the last gasp of air to pass into the ball before forcing the next one through.  
  
  I tied my shoes reluctantly and we went outside.  
  
  We kicked back and forth in silence for a while. I could hear the newscasters chattering inside. Their voices mingled with the clean thud of foot against ball.  
  
  The neighboring backyards were deserted. Swing sets stood still as ruins. The twins’ trampoline had ceased to squeak. I wanted to be back inside.  
  
  “That was a nice one,” said my father. “Good accuracy.”  
  
  But he didn’t know much about soccer. He kicked with the wrong part of the foot. I hit the next one too hard, and the ball disappeared into the honeysuckle in the corner of our yard. We stopped kicking then.  
  
  “You’re okay, right?” he said.  
  
  Large birds had begun to circle the sky. These were not suburban birds. These were hawks and eagles and crows, birds whose hefty wings spoke of the wilder landscapes that persisted east of here. They swooped from tree to tree, their calls drowning out the twitter of our usual backyard birds.  
  
  I knew that animals often sensed danger where humans did not, and that in the minutes or hours before a tsunami or a wildfire strikes, the animals always know to flee long before the people do. I had heard that elephants sometimes snapped their chains and headed for higher ground. Snakes could slither for miles.  
  
  “Do you think the birds know?” I asked. I could feel the muscles in my neck tensing as I watched them.  
  
  My father studied their shapes but said nothing. A hawk landed at the crown of our pine tree, flapped his wings, then took off again, heading farther west toward the coast.  
  
  From inside, my mother called to us through the screen door, “Now they’re saying it might be affecting gravity somehow.”  
  
  “We’ll be there in a minute,” said my father. He squeezed my shoulder hard, then tilted his head up to the sky like a farmer on the lookout for rain. “I want you to think how smart humans are,” he said. “Think of everything humans have ever invented. Rocket ships, computers, artificial hearts. We solve problems, you know? We always solve the big problems. We do.”  
  
  We walked inside after that, through the French doors and onto the tile, my father insisting that we wipe our feet on the doormat as we crossed—as if remembering our rituals could ensure our safe passage—back to the living room to my mother. But I felt as he spoke and as we walked that although the world remained intact for now, everything around me was about to come apart.  
  
  In the hours that followed, we would worry and wait. We would guess and wonder and speculate. We would learn new words and new ways from the scientists and officials who paraded in and out of our living room through the television screen and the Internet. We would stalk the sun across our sky as we never had before. My mother drank Scotch over ice in a glass. My father paced. Time moved differently that Saturday. Already the morning felt like yesterday. By the time we sat waiting for the sun to drift down behind the hills to the west, it seemed to me that several days had passed inside the skin of just this one, as if the day had ballooned by much more than a single small hour.  
  
  In the late afternoon, my father climbed the stairs to my parents’ bedroom and then reappeared transformed in a collared shirt and dark socks. A pair of dress shoes was swinging from two of his fingers.  
  
  “Are you going somewhere?” asked my mother.  
  
  “I’m on at six, remember?”  
  
  My father delivered babies for a living, and he specialized in high-risk births. He was often on call, and he sometimes worked the overnight shift at the hospital. He frequently worked weekends.  
  
  “Don’t go,” said my mother. “Not tonight.”  
  
  I remember hoping she could convince him not to go, but he continued to tie his shoes. He liked the loops in his bows to be exactly the same size.  
  
  “They’ll understand if you don’t show up,” said my mother. “It’s chaos out there, with the traffic and the panic and everything.”  
  
  Some of my f  
ather’s patients had spent months in the hospital, trying to hold their babies in their wombs until the babies were strong enough to survive the world.  
  
  “Come on, Helen,” he said. “You know I can’t stay.”  
  
  He stood up and patted his front pocket. I heard the muted jingle of keys.  
  
  “We need you here,” my mother said. She rested her head sideways against my father’s chest—he was over a foot taller. “We really don’t want you to go, right, Julia?”  
  
  I wanted him to stay, too, but I’d grown expert at diplomacy as only an only child can.  
  
  “I wish he didn’t have to go,” I said carefully. “But I guess if he has to go.”  
  
  My mother turned away from me and said to him more softly, “Please. We don’t even know what’s happening.”  
  
  “Come on, Helen,” he said, smoothing her hair. “Don’t be so dramatic. Nothing’s going to happen between now and tomorrow morning. I’m betting this whole thing will blow over.”  
  
  “How?” she said. “How could it?”  
  
  He kissed her on the cheek and waved to me from the entry hall. Then he stepped outside and shut the door. Soon we heard his car starting up in the driveway.  
  
  My mother flopped down next to me on the couch. “At least you’re not abandoning me,” she said. “We’ll have to take care of each other.”  
  
  I felt like escaping to Hanna’s house right then, but I knew it would upset my mother if I left.  
  
  From outside, the voices of children floated into the living room. Through the blinds, I could see the Kaplan family walking down the sidewalk. Saturday was their Sabbath day, which meant they didn’t drive all day. There were six of them now: Mr. and Mrs. Kaplan, Jacob, Beth, Aaron, and the baby in the stroller. The kids went to the Jewish day school up north, and they dressed mostly in black, in a way that reminded me of characters in old movies, a flutter of long skirts and black pants. Beth Kaplan was my age, but I didn’t know her well. She kept to herself. She wore a long-sleeve shirt and a long rectangular black skirt with stylish red patent-leather shoes. I figured that footwear was her one place to shine. As the Kaplans glided past our house, the littlest one picking dandelions from the edge of our lawn, I realized that they might not yet know about the slowing.  
  
  I found out much later from Jacob that I was right: The Kaplans did not discover until sundown—when their Sabbath was over and their religion once again allowed them to flip light switches and watch TV—that this world was any different from the one they’d been born into. If you didn’t hear the news, the landscape looked unchanged. This was not true later, of course, but for now, on this first day, the earth still seemed itself.  
  
  We lived on a cul-de-sac in a neighborhood of tract houses built in the 1970s on quarter-acre lots with stucco exteriors and asbestos in the ceilings and the walls. An olive tree twisted up from every front yard unless it had been torn out and replaced with some trendier, thirstier tree. The yards on our street were well kept but not obsessively so. Daisies and dandelions were scattered amid the thinning grass. Pink bougainvillea bushes clung to the sides of almost all the houses, shaking and shimmering in the wind.  
  
  In satellite maps from that era, our row of cul-de-sacs looks neat and parallel, each with a fat bulb at the end, like ten thermometers hanging from a string. Ours was one in a web of modest streets carved into the less expensive side of a coastal California hill whose pricier slope faced the ocean.  
  
  Our mornings were bright back then. Our kitchens faced east. Sun streamed through windows as coffeepots gurgled and showers ran, as I brushed my teeth or chose an outfit for school. Our afternoons were shady and cool because each evening, the sun dropped behind the nicer houses at the top of the hill a full hour before it slipped into the ocean on the other side. On this day, we waited for sunset with new suspense.  
  
  “I think it moved a little,” I said, squinting. “I mean, it’s definitely going down.”  
  
  All along the street, garage doors eased open on electric tracks. Station wagons and SUVs emerged, loaded with kids and clothes and dogs. A few neighbors stood clustered, arms crossed, on their lawns. Everyone was watching the sky as if waiting for a fireworks show to begin.  
  
  “Don’t look directly at the sun,” said my mother, who was sitting beside me on the porch. “It’ll ruin your eyes.”  
  
  She was peeling open a package of double-A batteries she’d found in a drawer. Three flashlights lay on the cement beside her, a mini arsenal of light. The sun remained high in the sky, but she had grown obsessed already with the possibilities of an extra-long night.  
  
  In the distance at the end of the street, I spotted my old friend Gabby, sitting alone on her roof. I hadn’t seen her much since her parents had transferred her to a private school in the next town over from ours. As usual, she was dressed in all black. Her dyed black hair stood out against the sky.  
  
  “Why did she dye it like that?” said my mother.  
  
  “I don’t know,” I said. Not visible from this distance were the three tiers of earrings that hung from both of Gabby’s ears. “She just felt like it, I guess.”  
  
  A portable radio chattered and buzzed beside us. We were gaining more minutes with every hour. Already, they were arguing about the wheat point—I’ve never understood if this was a term that had been buried for decades in the glossaries of textbooks, or if it was coined on that day, a new answer to a new question: How long can major crops survive without the light of the sun?  
  
  My mother switched the flashlights on and off, one by one, testing their beams in the cup of her hand. She dumped the old batteries out of each barrel and replaced them with new ones, as if arranging ammunition in a set of guns.  
  
  “I don’t know why your father hasn’t called me back,” she said.  
  
  She’d brought the cordless phone out to the porch, where it sat silent beside her. She took quick soundless sips of her drink. I remember her the way she was then, the sound of the ice clinking in the glass, the way the water dripped down the sides, leaving intersecting rings on the cement.  
  
  Not everyone panicked. Sylvia, my piano teacher, who lived across the street, went right on tending her garden as if nothing at all had happened. I watched her kneeling calmly in the dirt, a pair of shiny shears in one hand. Later, she took a slow walk around the block, her clogs tapping the sidewalk as she went, her red hair falling from a hasty braid.  
  
  “Hi, Julia,” she said when she reached our yard. She smiled at my mother but did not say her name. They were about the same age, but Sylvia still seemed girlish somehow, and my mother did not.  
  
  “You don’t seem very worried,” said my mother.  
  
  “Que será, será,” said Sylvia. Her words were one long sigh. “That’s what I always say. Whatever will be, will be.”  
  
  I liked Sylvia, but I knew my mother didn’t. Sylvia was cool and wispy and she smelled like lotion. Her limbs were lanky, like the branches of eucalyptus trees, and were often encircled in chunky turquoise jewelry, which she removed at the beginning of each of my piano lessons in order to commune more closely with the keys. She always played piano barefoot.  
  
  “Or maybe I’m just not thinking straight,” Sylvia said. “I’m in the middle of doing a cleanse.”  
  
  “What’s a cleanse?” I said.  
  
  “It’s a fast,” said Sylvia.  
  
  She bent toward me to explain, and I heard my mother slide her flashlights behind her back. I think she was suddenly embarrassed by her fear.  
  
  “No food, no alcohol, just water. For three days. I’m sure your mother has done one before.”  
  
  My mother shook her head. “Not me,” she said. I was aware of my mother’s drink, sweating on the pavement beside her. For a moment nothing else was said.  
  
  “Anyway,” said Sylvia, beginning to walk away, “don’t let this stop you from practicing, Julia. See you Wednesday.”  
  
  Sylvia would spend the next few afternoons pruning roses in a sun hat and casually pulling up weeds.  
  
  “You know, it’s not healthy to be that skinny,” said my mother after Sylvia h  
ad gone back to her gardening. (My mother kept a closet full of dresses one size too small, all waiting in plastic, for the day when she lost the ten pounds she’d been complaining about for years.) “You can see her bones,” said my mother. And it was true: You could.  
  
  “Look,” I said. “The streetlights came on.”  
  
  Those lights were set to a timer, designed to ignite at dusk. But the sun continued to shine.  
  
  I imagined people on the other side of the world, in China and in India, huddling now in the darkness, waiting, like us—but for dawn.  
  
  “He should let us know he got to work safely, at least,” said my mother. She dialed again, waited, set the phone down.  
  
  I’d gone with my father to work once. Not much had happened while I was there. Pregnant women watched television and ate snacks in bed. My father asked questions and checked charts. Husbands milled around.  
  
  “Didn’t I ask him to call?” she said.  
  
  She was making me nervous. I tried to keep her calm.  
  
  “He’s probably just busy,” I said.  
  
  In the distance, I noticed that Tom and Carlotta, the old couple who lived at the end of the street, were sitting outside, too, he in a faded tie-dyed T-shirt and jeans, she in Birkenstocks, a long gray braid resting on her shoulder. But they were always out there at this time of night, beach chairs in the driveway, margaritas and cigarettes in their hands. Their garage door stood open behind them, Tom’s model train tracks exposed like guts. Most of the houses on our street had been remodeled by then, or fixed up, at least, given fresh veneers like old teeth, but Tom and Carlotta’s house remained untouched, and I knew from selling Girl Scout cookies that the original burgundy shag still lined their floors.  
  
  Tom waved at me, his hand thick with a drink. I didn’t know him well, but he was always friendly to me. I waved back.  
  
  It was October, but it felt like July: The air was summer air, the sky a summer sky, still light past seven o’clock.  
  
  “I hope the phones are working,” said my mother. “But they must be working, right?”  
  
  In the time since that night, I’ve developed many of my mother’s habits, the persistent churning of her mind on a single subject, her low tolerance for uncertainty, but like her wide hips and her high cheekbones, these were traits that would sleep dormant in me for some years to come. That night I could not relate to her.

1msxps2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundPaper/comments/1msxps2/tired_of_wasting_hours_browsing_arxiv_heres_a/,Tired of Wasting Hours Browsing arXiv? Here's a Smarter Way to Stay Updated,"I guess many of you (myself included) have the same daily struggle: 👉 Hundreds of new arXiv papers every day. 👉 Keyword search is too noisy. 👉 End up spending more time **finding** papers than actually **reading** them.

https://preview.redd.it/9r2ovrhmbmjf1.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=618381c25f0ab6180f12d778d5ebdbca3196290d

That’s why I started using [**PaperPush.today**](https://paperpush.today/) — a tool that gives me **personalized arXiv paper subscriptions + push notifications**. Instead of doomscrolling arXiv, I now get a short list of actually relevant papers in my inbox every morning.

# 🔍 Why It’s Different from Plain RSS Feeds

* **Smart filters** → Not just keywords
* **Flexible alerts** → Daily digest or weekly summary
* **Cross-field tracking** → Perfect for interdisciplinary research
* **(Coming soon)** AI recommendations, semantic search, and even automated paper summaries

Basically, it feels like arXiv, but *supercharged*.

# 📖 My Setup (and Tips for Others)

* I use **keyword** (e.g. “LLM“)
* I set a **daily digest email** so I can skim in 5 mins while having coffee
* Every 2 weeks, I refine my keywords → keeps the feed sharp

# 🧪 Who Might Find This Useful

* **PhD students** → way less time wasted during lit review
* **Labs/teams** → everyone stays aligned on trending research
* **Industry folks** → quick filter for implementation-relevant work

One PhD I know literally cut arXiv browsing time from 2h/day → 10min/day. Another research group uses it to coordinate which papers to discuss weekly.

# ❓ FAQ (Stuff I Asked Before Trying It)

* **Is it free?** → Basic features yes, advanced AI stuff will be paid later
* **Other databases?** → Currently arXiv, but bioRxiv / medRxiv are on the roadmap
* **Difference from RSS?** → It ranks/filter papers for *you*, not just dumping every post

# 🌟 Why I’m Sharing This

I know a lot of us are drowning in arXiv PDFs. This tool isn’t perfect yet (the AI recommendation engine is still in dev), but it’s already saving me hours every week.

If you want to give it a spin: 👉 [**PaperPush.today**](https://paperpush.today/)

Would love to hear how you all handle arXiv overload — do you just skim RSS, use Twitter, or rely on word of mouth?",0,1755453386.0,FoundPaper,0,0.5,False
1msxphc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1msxphc/feeling_desperate_because_of_mistakes_i_make_at/,Feeling desperate because of mistakes I make at work.,"TL;DR: I am forgetful and careless at work, and I can't seem to improve. Any tips?

Hi, 

I'm making a desperate call for help, so any advice would be much appreciated.

I am in the worst possible mental state once again. For about three years, I have been living in a cycle where, around summer, I want to kill myself. Then things get better and I think I'm OK, but then the same problems arise and I get worse every time. This time feels desperate, I hate myself and losing hope for the future.

My main problem, which is causing me to fail in life and has given me a horrible self-esteem, is, of course, ADHD-related: I can't do my job well. I forget things, don't think things through and create difficulties for other people by asking for favours at the last minute, and my colleagues are fed up with me; I have grandiose plans, but I never follow through.
I've tried everything, so I don't know if there's a solution, but maybe someone has some tips.

These are the things that didn't help:
1. Medication (I tried the only two options available in my country): it doesn't have a great positive effect, but it has harsh side effects.
2. Vitamins, proper food, coffee, no coffee, gym, no gym, more sleep, less sleep — it seems I've tried everything and nothing works. 
3. Planners: I've tried a calendar with notifications, a paper planner and an online planner, but nothing helps. Either I forget to write things down, I don't realise that I need to write things down, or I see that I need to do something but still ignore it.

My job is not the problem. In fact, my job is perfect for me. When I do a good job, I am super satisfied and happy. These problems follow me everywhere: in college, in every job I've had, and in friendships as well. It's most terrifying in the job sphere because I have finally found a place where I enjoy working, and I love my tasks. The prospect of losing this job and not having the opportunity to build a career terrifies me. So any tips helps. ",1,1755453366.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

1msxj5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/chat/comments/1msxj5f/read_my_outline_for_a_book_or_movie/,Read my outline for a book or movie?,"I’ve never written anything like this but I’m looking for some critique. 



Star Island, served by a single two-lane half mile long bridge is exactly 4 miles long by 1 mile wide. The island has a gentle rise to the center with a whitewashed stone lighthouse built in the 1800s. The island has wide beaches on its entire perimeter with double row salt grass dunes, the windward side of the island has coarse pink sand, the leeward side has a slightly wider beach with white sand as fine as flour. The Clark shoal, a mile offshore stalls the North Atlantic waves causing them to drop their sediment delivering bright blue, crystal clear water around the island. 

For 9000 years the island was home to the White Oak Iroquois who made their living harvesting shellfish and building weirs to catch migrating fish, in 1567 Spanish settlers chased the Iroquois away and called it home before heading back across the Atlantic 12 years later. Up until the early 2000s when three corrupt politicians changed the zoning rules the island looked just like it did all the way back to the Ice Age. 

The last of the fishing families that lived on the island left in the 90s when farmed shrimp from Vietnam and South America made their way of life impossible.  The last of the 844 three and four story homes on Star Island were constructed in 2015 and are only occupied for the 98 days between Memorial and Labor Day by the ultra wealthy from DC, Charlotte and Richmond.  Except for an occasional late fall or winter visit by a lonely wife looking for privacy with a new friend the 844 houses spend most of the year the lights out, the blinds drawn and the taps closed. 

Before 2005 there was an oasis only accessible by shallow draft boat where locals would go and enjoy the pristine beaches.  Seahorses, pipefish, stingrays, triggerfish, puffers and thousands of reef fish from the tropics would swim off of the Gulfstream conveyor during the summer and spend it around Star Island. The convergence of currents and concentration of sea life attracted dolphins, seals, pelicans, green turtles and cormorants. 
After the dunes were pushed aside for a poorly built bridge the developers came to place million dollar houses 8 feet apart around the entire shore, there’s a running joke that you can pass the ketchup to your neighbor without getting up from the table.  

The locals stopped feeling welcome among expensive beach umbrellas and litter right around the time the animals felt the same way, the last dolphin, seal and turtle had been seen from Star Island around 2015. The ancient pelican colony at the north end was the last hold out until a hedge fund manager planted a 6 bedroom mirrored glass cube that concentrated the sun into the seagrass and burned away the nesting area. Dunes interrupted by houses allow soil to wash down the beach and cloud the water which kept the fish away from sure for weeks at a time after a rain. The vacationers tell their friends about the unspoiled beauty of Star Island but to the locals who have a  memory of it from 10 years earlier the island is blighted.


On September 17th of 2023 hurricane Gloria destroys the only bridge to the island.
 
On May 25th of 2024 the Turner Bridge Co completed construction of a new two lane, half mile long bridge connecting Star Island to the mainland. 

Since the bridge crosses a body of water its oversight and administration are the responsibility of the Star Island district of the North Carolina Marine Patrol. 

Scene opens with a man in a white shirt in an office lit with flickering fluorescent lights. 
 loosened tie, his left hand is rubbing his forehead and he is slowly shaking his head in disbelief  as he reads from a stack of paper on the desk. 

He reads quietly, as he does his eyes widen more and more, he flips back one page, quickly shakes his head back-and-forth and reads out loud- salvors separated from company during execution of contract shall become the ward of the province for whom they were under contract, province shall provide employment, maintenance and cure for the working and retired life of separated salvor. 

Scene: same man (a lawyer for the state) stands in front of the desk of Chief Dave Ferguson of the Star Island district of the North Carolina Marine patrol. 

Lawyer: Dave I’ve been reading the closeout paperwork and the agreement you signed with Turner Bridge Co. has this addendum tacked onto the bottom of the change order for the second exit ramp, any idea why this would be in there?

Dave: (reads the paper): I’ve known Randy Turner since 5th grade, he can be one slippery SOB (laughs)  What’s a separated salvor?

Lawyer: well, it could be anything really, a person left behind after a boat leaves or it could mean someone that was fired from the company under contract to a municipality, the citations are from 1830 maritime law and are still on the books in NC.

Dave: (laughing)  Why would that be there? In case they leave someone and forgot to tell him there was a new bridge that he could walk back over? 

Lawyer: (nervously) heh…funny, Dave, who knows, this is sometimes a copy and paste business, weird things get scooped up every now and then but this is oddly specific.

Lawyer: Wait, there’s another subsection with language about seasonal use of transponder based RFID collection array on the incoming and outgoing sides of the bridge…is that like traffic control? what the hell? That doesn’t make any sense, there isn’t one traffic light for miles on the mainland and the whole island only has one stop sign. Any idea what this is about?

Dave (blank stare): I don’t know what any of those words mean so I’ll leave that massive pile of paper to you, I need to head over to Mrs. Jennings house because the neighbor is touching her trash cans again. 

Lawyer: Dave, all due respect but I’ve begged before, please stop signing things that I haven’t seen first!

Dave: Aw come on, you’d be bored if I didn’t give you things to worry about. 

Chief Ferguson pats lawyers back and walks out, sipping coffee from a paper cup. 

Dave: (calling back as he turns the corner out of sight) Breathe…..remember? in for four, hold for seven, out for eight… or maybe it was in for 8 and hold for 2?  It’ll all be ok. 



Scene: Randy Turner Junior, 25-year-old son of Randy Turner Sr. founder of the Turner bridge Company stands in front of a gigantic dark walnut desk, the office walls are covered in heavy gold leaf framed pictures of bridges that the Turner Bridge Company has built. 

Randy Sr. (in a slow southern drawl): I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you giving this a go, I know you did it for me and I know your mama would be so proud. You can always come back,  I know how much you love animals and how important this is to you.  

Randy Jr: i’m not gonna build bridges but I’m gonna make the world better. 

Randy Sr:  Well this last bit is nothing more than a formality, these are your separation papers from Turner Bridge. Two Mondays from now you be at Chief Ferguson‘s office down at the marina at 7am he’ll be ready for you. (Randy Sr. stands up, comes around the desk and gives Randy Jr a hug, he pulls back, shuts one eye, tilts his head and says with the sideways smile) So, you’re gonna be a pet detective?

Randy Jr:(exasperated) No!!!  Dad!!! I’m gonna be an animal protection officer! We talked about this!

Randy Sr: (tightening up the hug) oh come on, I know, just teasin, I can’t think of anybody better for the job. Your mom called you Dr Doolittle since you were 3, she knew you were born for it and I was jus too stubborn to listen, 

Narrator: deep voice, heavy drawl
Randy Turner Jr was voted kindest student every year from kindergarten all the way through junior high, they invented the category for him, mostly because it was true, he did have the kindest most gentle soul, but partly because no matter how hard he tried everything he touched would fall apart. Randy was as strong as he was kind, he wasn’t a show off but those that knew him were aware that he could lift and move things with ease that would take two or three adults. Randy was as loyal to his friends and good natured as they come, he never raised his voice, never got angry, because of this no one ever teased him about the cloud of technical misfortune that would often follow him.  

Brief montage: Randy Jr causing:
bouncy house deflating, science fair volcano catching fire, fire sprinklers going off three separate times because his book bag got hooked on the handles, entire row of lockers falling over into the hallway because he closed his coat in the door and walked away, water fountain handle breaking off in his hand and spraying water all over the floor.


Narrator: 
After high school trouble followed Randy into the family business. 


Brief montage: Randy Jr causing:
construction equipment falling off barges, temporary dams bursting, concrete trucks unloaded onto the ground instead of into forms, dump trucks burying parked cars


One year prior:
Scene: bridge construction site in New Jersey, four men in Turner Bridge Company coveralls in a huddle whispering. 
Man 1: God bless him but he’s going to get one of us killed, he flipped my truck with the bobcat, if I was in it I would be dead! 
Man 2: that thing was on its last legs, and what are you complaining about, Mr. Turner bought you a brand new one!
Man 3: He backfilled four caissons I spent the entire day digging. 
Man 4: and Mr. Turner paid you double time to stay and dig them back out, I can’t tell you how many of his messes I clean up and I don’t get nothin!
Man 2 to man 4: is nothin paying off your moms house when she got sick?!?
Man 4: We’ll…. that wasn’t for me exactly….
Man 1: OK, we’re not getting anywhere with this we need to find him something to do to keep him out of trouble.  
Man 4: I got it and it’s perfect!
Man 3: well you better get him on it because here he comes. 


Randy Jr: (puling on work gloves) mornin fellas!

Man 4:  Randy, these environmentalists have been all over us at this site, saying some shit about impacting the habitat of the long armed hermit crab, I know you know everything there is to know about animals so your job is finding any long arm hermit crabs and moving them at least 500 yards away from the bridge bulk heads. Now, it’s not an easy job, they can be fast and when you bring them down the beach they’ll probably come right back overnight so you might need to do it a few times until they all get the message to stay away, think you can handle it?


Randy Jr: (huge smile) yes! 
Randy begins running towards the shoreline. 

Man 4: (yelling) Hey Randy! Keep track of how many you move, those environmentalists want to know! Randy!!! You might want to bring a bucket unless you wanna carry them one at a time! 

Randy Jr: (voice rough while he runs) that’s OK! I’ve got pockets, I don’t mind!

Men 1,2,3&4 smile as they watch him run off towards the shoreline  

Man 4: (shakes his head, speaking under his breath) perfect, god help those hermit crabs. 


Randy Junior spends the day picking up every hermit crab he can find in the rock pools. One by one he picks them up, gently loading them into his shirt, jacket and pants pockets, once his pockets are full he walks them down the beach and gently places them in a little rock playpen he made for them right at the low tide zone. By 4 PMRandy has moved 1241 long arm hermit crabs to safety.  

Randy Jr: (bent over picking up shells) hey, don’t bite this is good for you…I know you don’t want to leave but I’ve got a perfect spot for you… 
Randy Jr: (unloading pockets of hermits)see, much better here.. sorry about the lint…I think you all know each other.. 

Scene in trailer office, blue prints on walls, drafting tables and safety bulletins poster everywhere.  

Man 4:  Randy make make sure when you fill out your report that it says how many hermits you picked up, where you put them, the time you finished, water turbidity and the tide. 

Randy Jr. (peels sheet from clipboard and hands it over before Man 4 finishes sentence) done!

Man 4: (reads over a flawless report, nods his head and gives a huge smile) Would you look at this!! (holds paper high and waves it to others in the office) This is my management skills, I have found the right man for the job, I trained him, I encouraged him to grow and now look! I should write a book.. I’ll call it From Crane Operator to the C-Suite!! or maybe a speaking tour, you now Mark Cuban gets a half mill for a 20 minute speech?! Thats gonna be me! (others in office barely look up and most roll their eyes and sigh) 



Narrator over montage of Randy Jr with animals:

Strength and kindness were his gifts but his way with animals was his superpower, angry dogs would wag their tails and tuck their ears back and nuzzle him, he could get a sparrow to land on his index finger just by holding it out, he was often called on to take beehives out of attics and tool sheds which he did without so much as a single sting, he disabled all the mouse traps when he worked at the grocery store, opting instead to almost ask the mice to be in a shoebox he left in the back room by morning where he drove them across town to let them go in a field. When he fished he would hold his breath the moment the fish left the water and would only breathe again once the fish was revived and had swam away; it wasn’t that he could talk to animals but he had the ability to feel what they were feeling and they recognized it and were drawn to him no matter the species. 





Facts to widen:
RandyJr is incredibly handsome but only in profile  
RandyJr needs a mutuality unexpressed love interest, she should help move the mission along. 

Randy Sr and Chief Ferguson are conspiring to return Star Island to its former beauty, they’ll use the EZ pass system to build a 20 million dollar war chest to fund legal battles that will declare all the houses illegal.  

Randy Sr has known the first bridge wasn’t going to last since the day the government finished it, he and friends have been waiting to take advantage of its eventual failure  

Randy Junior will find environmental reasons why the houses cannot be there because of the unique nature of the island and the house’s impacts on the sea and animals. He’s gonna save the day. Emerita analoga (or mole crab)  lives in the sand at the waterline will be the thing RJ finds to trigger emergency reclamation  


Issues:
Need to make the house owners hate worthy.   
How do I get the characters to win and remove all the houses without short changing the owners, surely they can’t all be bad people and don’t deserve to lose $1 million houses.

1msxidv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1msxidv/does_aqua_crest_faucet_mount_filter_truly_deliver/,Does AQUA CREST Faucet Mount Filter Truly Deliver? In-Depth Review for Safer Water,"The AQUA CREST AQU-CF08A, a faucet water filter replacement, has been a recent addition to my home setup, primarily to improve the drinking water quality for my family. With much skepticism, I approached its installation, recalling the countless filters I’ve tried in the past that either claimed too much or delivered too little. This item promised NSF certifications, compatibility with numerous PUR models, and high-efficiency filtration; naturally, my curiosity was piqued.

**Ease of Installation and Design**

Installing this filter replacement turned out to be a surprisingly simple process. Unlike some overly complicated filter setups I’ve dealt with before, this design allowed for a quick and fuss-free installation. The dimensions, measuring 2.56”D x 7.68”W x 4.92”H, felt ideal for my modestly sized kitchen faucet. The sleek blue finish complemented the space beautifully, making it less of an eyesore and more of an understated utility. The lead-free, food-grade material offers peace of mind, especially when you consider the safety concerns many of us have today regarding drinking water.

**Performance and Filtration Efficiency**

Set up and running, the filter immediately demonstrated its worth. Using natural coconut activated carbon, it claims a 97.2% reduction in chlorine, odor, and unpleasant taste. Putting it through the ultimate family test—serving water-loving kids who insist water is “weird-tasting”—it scored high. I tested it in various scenarios, including making coffee and tea, where subtle flavors often betray poor water quality. Impressively, drinks tasted cleaner and fresher. However, it’s worth noting that this filter doesn’t reduce TDS, which might be a point of disappointment for some.

[Time to see AQUA CREST AQU-CF08A cost on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b01bsgm7ku/)

**Long-Lasting and Durable**

The filter lifespan estimates itself to last around three months, which I felt was reasonable given its efficiency. Daily usage, including family breakfasts and quick refills throughout the day, didn’t seem to deter the performance. However, living in an area with hard water did compel me to consider earlier replacements. Thankfully, the three-pack packaging offered some relief—no rushing out to buy replacements every few weeks.

**Compatibility and Versatility**

One of its most advertised strengths is its adaptability to several PUR models, including the likes of FM-3700, FM-3400B, and even advanced mounts like PFM450S. It seamlessly fit my PFM350V, making it a dual win—ease of use and compatibility.

**Positives**

- Compatibility with a wide range of PUR faucet mounts, eliminating guesswork.
- Activated carbon filtration ensures noticeably cleaner, better-tasting water.
- Straightforward installation without the headache of complex tools or steps.
- Durable lead-free materials certified by NSF for safety.
- A convenient three-pack that minimizes frequent replacement hassles.

**Negatives**

- Lack of TDS filtration might be a dealbreaker for certain households.
- Inconsistency in filtration lifespan depending on water quality (e.g., very hard or softened water).
- Initial flushing before first use is a must, which felt slightly inconvenient.

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this filter to similar market offerings, such as the original PUR RF-9999 filter, puts a few things into perspective. While the original filters might slightly edge ahead in TDS reduction and branding assurance, the AQUA CREST proves more cost-effective and equally adept at handling chlorine, odor, and sediment reduction. A third contender, the Waterdrop WD-FC-06, offers a slightly sleeker design but sacrifices some filtration efficiency in exchange.

In direct use, I found the AQUA CREST filter to cater better to the average household needing everyday cleaner water without breaking the bank. Those with highly specific water concerns, like heavy lead content, may still lean towards more niche competitors.

**Cost Efficiency**

Having a product that balances affordability with genuine quality isn’t always easy. I’ve often overspent on branded filters hoping for revolutionary change that never quite materialized. This product offers a fair trade-off, delivering reliable water purification while remaining economical for families or shared spaces. Though exact prices vary, any savvy shopper would agree it stands strong in its category of faucet mount filters.

im 21 and nonbinary (they/he) from the US and would really love to be sending more letters. I had a couple of pen pals like 15 years ago and have been writing my partner letters for a couple of years recently, but I'd like to write more. 

a little bit about me:
-im going into my senior year of college (English and communications)
-im a writer! I do a lot of writing 
-im crafty, mostly knitting and sewing, but I've dabbled in some other crafts. i can and will ramble about corsetry for way too long.
-ive been getting back into reading, love a good TV show and movie, and am really into audio dramas. 
-i do a bit of gaming, mostly bouncing between Minecraft, sims 4, and stardew valley.
-i like making silly little drinks of all kinds (coffee, cocktails, cocktails, etc.)

It’s to stride with intent, even when reciting the map upside-down. Tourism roared back through 2024 with over 1.4 billion international arrivals, an 11 percent leap over 2023 that nearly erased pandemic scars, as heralded by UN Tourism’s World. Yet not all streets welcome aimless wonder. Some are petty-crime arenas where confusion is currency, and you’ve just flashed your wallet.

The hack is to walk with purpose when untethered, duck into a café or curious shop instead of freezing on the curb like a target in training. Every traveler with savvy knows a sudden bookstore refuge or bakery oasis is safer than blinking under streetlamps.

Look at the safer frontiers now. According to the 2025 Global Peace Index, the five countries with the least pickpocketing and low petty crime are Iceland, New Zealand, Finland, Switzerland, and Denmark. Their streets offer that rare air of trust. Windows not pried, pockets not rifled, and sneakers not scuffed in surprising ways. On the flip side, the five most notorious for the small-crook arts are Venezuela, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, and India. Places where a second of disorientation can cost a day’s travel budget and a night’s peace.

Timing is everything for safety. Avoid the winter shoulder seasons in high-tourism areas when shift-worker fatigue and cash-heavy crowds heighten petty theft opportunities. Instead, aim for late spring or early autumn when daylight stretches, the mood softens, and streets are less frenzied. An ideal environment to slip into a café, raise an espresso as armor, and collect orientation without flashing vulnerability.

Even in riskier realms, the game isn’t to surrender, but to move smart. Stride past that souvenir stall, duck into shade, use café leanbacks, and stock up on fortified coffee and casual stoicism. You lose nothing by appearing surer than you feel. Travel thrives on momentum. Not open displays of compass-less defeat.

So walk like you belong, even when the street you stare at makes no sense. Spend 3.50 US dollars on a café Americano, orient behind its steam, and then slip back into the street with direction. A purposeful stride amid confusion is like invisible armor against pickpockets and the petty chaos of the world. The sidewalk becomes safer when you own your steps. Even if your destination is still a question.

# Best Commercial Ice Machine Filter 2025: Top Brands Compared

Commercial ice machines are indispensable in restaurants, bars, hotels, and various other businesses. However, the quality of ice they produce is directly impacted by the water source.

These filters are designed to remove contaminants, ensuring that the ice produced is not only clean and safe but also crystal clear. Investing in a high-quality commercial ice machine filter is essential for maintaining the longevity and performance of your ice machine, as well as safeguarding the health of your customers. This article will delve into the best commercial ice machine filters available in 2025, comparing top brands and highlighting their key features and benefits.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a commercial ice machine filter depends on several key features. These include the filtration capacity, flow rate, filter media, pressure requirements, and overall construction. Understanding these aspects is crucial for selecting the right filter for your specific needs.

**Filtration Capacity:** This refers to the amount of water a filter can effectively process before needing replacement.

A filter with a high filtration capacity is ideal for businesses with high ice production demands. Capacity is typically measured in gallons or liters. For instance, a filter with a 25,000-gallon capacity can process that much water before its filtration efficiency significantly decreases. It's important to choose a filter with a capacity that aligns with your ice machine's water usage to minimize maintenance and ensure consistent water quality.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate indicates how quickly water can pass through the filter.

A higher flow rate ensures that your ice machine receives a continuous and adequate supply of water, preventing delays in ice production. Flow rates are usually measured in gallons per minute (GPM). An ideal flow rate will depend on the size and type of your ice machine. Insufficient flow can lead to decreased ice production and potential damage to the machine.

**Filter Media:** This refers to the materials used to remove impurities from the water.

Common filter media include activated carbon, sediment filters, and phosphate feeders. Activated carbon is highly effective at removing chlorine, taste, and odor, while sediment filters trap particulate matter like sand and rust. Phosphate feeders help prevent scale buildup by inhibiting mineral deposition. The choice of filter media should be based on the specific contaminants present in your water supply.

**Pressure Requirements:** This specifies the minimum and maximum water pressure the filter can handle.

Operating a filter outside of its pressure range can lead to damage or reduced performance. It’s crucial to ensure that your water pressure falls within the filter's specified range. Using a pressure regulator might be necessary if your water pressure is too high.

**Construction and Materials:** The durability and longevity of a filter depend on its construction and the materials used.

High-quality filters are typically made from robust materials like stainless steel or reinforced plastic. The housing should be able to withstand the pressures and temperatures associated with commercial water systems. A well-constructed filter will also minimize the risk of leaks and ensure long-term reliability.

Filters help to mitigate this issue by removing these minerals before they can accumulate. This extends the lifespan of the ice machine and reduces the need for frequent maintenance.

**Reduced Maintenance Costs:** Filters minimize the need for descaling and other maintenance procedures.

Descaling is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that involves removing mineral deposits from the ice machine. By preventing scale buildup, filters reduce the frequency of descaling, saving time and money on maintenance. This allows businesses to focus on their core operations without being burdened by equipment upkeep.

**Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** Clean and safe ice contributes to a positive customer experience.

Customers expect the ice in their drinks to be clean and free from contaminants. By providing high-quality ice, businesses can enhance their reputation and build customer loyalty. This is especially important in the food and beverage industry, where quality and hygiene are paramount.

## FAQs Section

**Are stainless steel tea kettles safe to use on a gas range?**
yes, stainless steel tea kettles are generally considered safe for use on gas ranges. Look for kettles made from food-grade stainless steel (18/8 or 18/10) to ensure no harmful chemicals leach into the water. Avoid kettles with plastic components that may come into direct contact with the flame.

**How do I clean a tea kettle designed for a gas range?**

Regular cleaning prevents mineral buildup and maintains the kettle's performance.To clean your kettle, boil a mixture of equal parts water and white vinegar inside the kettle. Let it sit for an hour, then scrub the interior with a soft brush. Rinse thoroughly and dry. For stubborn mineral deposits, repeat the process or use a commercial descaling solution.

**Can I use a tea kettle designed for a gas range on an electric stove?**

Most tea kettles designed for gas ranges can also be used on electric stoves, including induction cooktops. However, it's crucial to check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure compatibility. Kettles with flat, magnetic stainless steel bases are generally compatible with induction cooktops.**How do I prevent my tea kettle from rusting?**

While stainless steel is rust-resistant, rust can still occur if the kettle is not properly maintained. Always empty the kettle fully after each use and dry it thoroughly to prevent water from sitting inside. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or steel wool, which can damage the surface and increase the risk of rust. Regular cleaning with vinegar can also help prevent mineral buildup that can contribute to rust formation.

1msxa1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/punk/comments/1msxa1q/what_do_punks_think_about_gentrification/,What do punks think about gentrification?,"I don't mean no disrespect or anything to punk culture with this question, I'm just curious. I'm into punk rock, but I haven't had much time to get involved with the community yet (I do share a lot of punks core values though).

What do punks think about gentrification? This thought to me occurs as I just walked by a punk-themed coffee shop in my city charigng $8 for a latte in a historically low-income neighborhood. The neighborhood has recently been hit with gentrification from university in the area that has slowly taken more and more of the neighborhood, and while I do believe that college students obviously need places to go, it pisses me off to see low income residents being displaced because of that.

Not necessarily blaming the coffee shop, at this point, the area is basically fully gentrified. Good luck finding any affordable rent or food options within 5 - 10 blocks of it, but only like 10-15 years ago it was a low income area with majority POC residents, it definitely doesn't reflect that anymore...

But just the thought of a punk themed coffee shop co-existing with gentrification, hell, a punk-themed coffee shop selling $8 lattes ANYWHERE genuinely baffles me. It feels almost the opposite of what I know punk values to be, it just feels like they're trying to cater to the college students in the area.

Is punk culture starting to align with hipsters/yuppies? Or are they just trying to steal it? 

Just curious what yall thoughts abt this are, figured we could discuss.",1,1755452416.0,punk,7,0.6,False

Hello!

I am very new to the area. In my previous city. I would post on the local subreddit asking if anyone would like to talk to a stranger or need help with a task, and I was super happy with the results. I would meet people at coffee shops and they would vent to me or talk to me about things they just liked to talk about. I would help people move furniture, do lawn care, and I even helped build an enclosure for a baby possum. I do it for free and really enjoy meeting strangers.

I am stressed from everything around me. I am very tired of criticism of my appearance and weight, and that all people think they know me better than myself and talk about me, and no one leaves me alone. I am tired of my family who thinks I must be perfect and an angel and that it is not right for me to make mistakes. I breathe. I like to have friends and admire someone. Thank God, I do not think about getting engaged at all, but I am always under pressure as if I am a criminal and it is not right for me to do anything. My sister hates me and wants to love and get engaged and admire her normally, and that is not right for me. If I sit with my friends and tell them that there is a young man who looks good or she admires him, she goes and tells my family and tells me everything, so I will tell my father. She wants me to do what she wants and she lives her life, and she is actually younger than me. I really always want to commit suicide and I tried twice and failed once on his birthday and My family was having his birthday party at home and I went with my dad and sister to buy a cake and a gateau and I wanted to choose everything but I found her choosing and didn’t want me to choose anything and I got upset and angry. You can consider it a simple situation but that day I drank half a strip of painkillers in my coffee and I didn’t feel anything except a little pain and I was drinking it and I wanted to die and I didn’t know what to do but now I really want to commit suicide and I’m so tired ",4,1755452354.0,SuicideWatch,1,0.75,False

Everything about this town reminded me of why the hell I’d wanted to get away. I had a life in Tuscaloosa and I needed that life to escape. Here, I was Marcus Hardy. No matter where I went people knew me. They knew my family. And now... they were talking about my family. Which is why I had come home. Leaving my sister and mother here alone to face this was impossible. The scandal hovering over our heads took away all my choices and my freedom. Right now, few people knew but it was only a matter of time. Soon the entire coastal town of Sea Breeze, Alabama would know what my dad was doing or should I say, who my dad was doing. King of the Mercedes car dealerships along the Gulf Coast had been a high enough title for some little gold digging whore only a few years older than me to jump in bed with my dear ‘ol dad. The one time I’d seen the home wrecker working behind the desk right outside Dad’s office I’d known something wasn’t right. She was young and smoking hot and apparently money hungry.  
  
  Dad couldn’t keep it in his pants and now my mom and sister would have to deal with the stigma it would cause. People would feel sorry for Mom. This was already devastating to her and she didn’t even know yet that the other woman was barely a woman. My younger sister Amanda had caught them going at it one evening late when Mom had sent her over to the office to take Dad some dinner. She’d called me that night crying hysterically. I’d withdrawn from school, packed my things and headed home. There was no other option. My family needed me.  
  
  A knock on the door snapped me out of my internal tirade and I went to see what chick was here looking for Cage this time. God knew the guy had an endless line of females parading through his life. My new roommate was a player. A major player. He put my best friend, Preston, to shame. I twisted the knob and swung the door open without peeking through the hole.  
  
  The surprise was on me. I’d been prepared to tell whatever tall willowy large but obviously fake chested female dressed in almost nothing waiting outside the door that Cage was busy with another one very similar to her. Except a very natural almost curvy red head stood before me. Red rimmed eyes and a tear streaked face gazed up at me. There was no mascara lines running down her face. Her hair wasn’t styled but pulled back in a pony tail. She wore jeans and what appeared to be an authentic Back in Black AC/DC concert t-shirt. No belly button flashing a flat tanned stomach and her clothes weren’t skin tight. Well maybe the jeans were a little snug but they hugged her hips nicely. My appreciation of her legs in the slim fit jeans stopped however when I noticed the small beat up suitcase clutched tightly in her hand.  
  
  “Is Cage here?” Her voice sounded broken and musical at the same time. I was having a hard time digesting that this girl was here for Cage. She wasn’t anything like he veered toward. Nothing was enhanced. Everything from her thick dark copper hair to the Chuck Taylors on her feet screamed, “not Cage’s type.” And the fact she was carrying a suitcase, well that couldn’t be good.  
  
  “Uh, um, no.”  
  
  Her shoulders slumped and another sob escaped her mouth. One small dainty hand flew up in an attempt to mute the sound of her obvious distress. Her nails were even classy. Not too long with a smooth rounded tip and soft pink nail polish.  
  
  “I left my cell phone,” she let out a sigh then continued, “at my sister’s. I need to call him. Can I come in?”  
  
  Cage was out with a swimsuit model that apparently had a thing for college baseball players. I knew from the way he talked he didn’t intend to come up for air much tonight. He’d never answer her call and I hated to see her get more upset than she already was. A horrible thought crossed my mind, surely he hadn’t gotten this girl pregnant. Couldn’t he see how freaking innocent she was.  
  
  “Uh, yeah but I don’t know if he’ll answer. He’s busy... tonight.”  
  
  She shot me a sour smile and nodded stepping around me.  
  
  “I know the kind of busy he is but he’ll talk to me.”  
  
  She sounded rather confident. I wasn’t feeling her confidence myself.  
  
  “Do you have a cell I can use?”  
  
  I reached into the pocket of my jeans and handed it to her unable to argue with her further. She had stopped crying and I wanted to keep it that way.  
  
  “Thanks, I’ll try calling first.”  
  
  I watched as she walked over to the sofa and dropped her suitcase to the floor with a thunk before sinking dejectedly down onto the worn cushions as if she’d been here a hundred times. Being as I’d only been moved in for two days, I wouldn’t know if she had been here before or not. Cage was a friend of a friend who had been looking for a roommate. I needed somewhere to live fast and his place was nice. Preston was on the same baseball team as Cage at the local community college. Once Preston heard I needed a place to live he called Cage and hooked me up.  
  
  “It’s me. I left my phone when I ran. You’re not here but your new roommate let me in. Call me,” she sniffed then hung up. I watched fascinated as she proceeded to text him. She really believed the male whore I lived with was going to call her right up as soon as he got her message. I was intrigued and growing more concerned by the minute.  
  
  She finished and handed the phone back to me. A smile touched her red splotchy face and two dimples appeared in her cheeks. Damn that was cute.  
  
  “Thanks, do you mind if I wait a little bit until he calls back?”  
  
  I shook my head, “No, not at all. You want a drink?” She nodded and stood up.  
  
  “Yes, but I’ll get it. My drinks are in the bottom drawer of the fridge behind the Bud Lights.”  
  
  I frowned and followed her into the kitchen. She opened the fridge and bent down to get her hidden drink. With her bent over digging for her so called drink the snug fit of the faded jeans over her ass was hard to miss. It was a perfect heart shape and although she wasn’t very tall her legs seemed to go on for miles.  
  
  “Ah, here it is. Cage needs to run to the store and restock. He must be letting his one nighters drink my Jarritos.”  
  
  I couldn’t keep guessing. I needed to know who she was exactly. Surely she wasn’t one of his girlfriends. Could she be the sister Preston had mentioned dating? I sure as hell hoped not. I was interested and I hadn’t been interested in anyone in awhile. Not since the last girl broke my heart. I opened my mouth to ask her how she knew Cage when the phone in my pocket started ringing. She walked over to me and held out her hand. The girl really believed it was Cage  
. I glanced down and sure enough, my roommate had called back.  
  
  She took the phone from my hand.  
  
  “Hey”  
  
  “She’s such a selfish jerk.”  
  
  “I can’t stay there Cage.”  
  
  “I didn’t mean to leave my phone. I was just upset.”  
  
  “Yes, your new roommate’s a nice guy. He’s been very helpful.”  
  
  “No, don’t end your date. Get her out of your system. I’ll wait.”  
  
  “I promise not to go back.”  
  
  “She is who she is Cage.”  
  
  “I just hate her,” I could hear the tears in her voice again.  
  
  “No, no, really I’m fine. I just needed to see you.”  
  
  “Don’t. I’ll leave.”  
  
  “Cage --”  
  
  “No”  
  
  “Cage”  
  
  “Okay fine.”  
  
  She held the phone out to me, “He wants to talk to you.”  
  
  This conversation was like nothing I’d expected. The girl had to be his sister.  
  
  “Hey.”  
  
  “Listen, I need you to make sure Low stays there until I can get home. She’s upset and I don’t want her leaving. Get her one of her damn Mexican soda thingys out of the fridge. They’re behind the Bud Lights in the bottom drawer. I have to hide them from other chicks I have over. All females tend to like those nasty drinks. Turn on the television, distract her, whatever. I’m only ten minutes away but I’m putting my jeans on as we speak and headed home. Just help get her mind off things but DON’T touch her.”  
  
  “Ah, okay sure. Is she your sister?”  
  
  Cage chuckled into the phone. “Hell no she ain’t my sister. I’d never buy my damn sister drinks and call her back when I’m in the middle of a fucking threesome. Low’s the girl I’m gonna marry.”  
  
  I had no response for that. My eyes found her standing over by the window with her back to me. The long thick copper locks curled on the ends and brushed against the middle of her back. She was absolutely nothing like the girls Cage regularly hooked up with. What did he mean she was the girl he was going to marry? That made no sense.  
  
  “Keep her there man. I’m on my way.”  
  
  Then he hung up the phone.  
  
  I dropped the phone on the table and stood there staring at her back. She turned around slowly and studied me a moment then a smiled broke across her face.  
  
  “He told you he was going to marry me didn’t he,” she said laughing softly before taking a drink of the orange soda with what appeared to have spanish writing on it.  
  
  “Crazy boy. I shouldn’t have bothered him but he’s all I’ve got.”  
  
  She walked over and sank back down onto the old faded green sofa pulling her legs up underneath her.  
  
  “Don’t worry. I’m not leaving. He’d rip apart my sister’s house searching for me and scare the bejesus out of her if I left. I’ve got enough issues where she’s concerned. I don’t intend to unleash Cage on her.”  
  
  I slowly made my way over to the only chair in the room and sat down.  
  
  “So, you’re engaged?” I asked staring down at her bare ring finger.  
  
  With a sad smile she shook her head.  
  
  “Not in a million years. Cage has crazy ideas. Just because he says them doesn’t make them true.”  
  
  She raised her eyebrows and took another drink of her soda.  
  
  “So, you aren’t going to marry Cage,” I really would love for her to clarify this because I was incredibly confused and more than a little interested in her. She bit down on her bottom lip and I noticed for the first time how full it was.  
  
  ”Cage was my ‘boy next door’ growing up. He’s my best friend. I love him dearly and he really is all I have. The only person I can count on. We’ve never actually been in a relationship before because he knows I won’t have sex with him and he needs sex. He’s also real wrapped up in the whole idea that a relationship between the two of us before we get married will end badly and he’ll lose me. He has this irrational fear of losing me.”  
  
  Did she know the guy had bagged over three different girls this week and apparently was having a threesome when she’d called? She was so much better than Cage.  
  
  “Wipe that look off your face. I don’t need your pity. I know what Cage is like. I know you have probably seen the kind of girls he’s attracted to and I look absolutely nothing like them. I don’t live in a fantasy world. I’m very aware,” she tilted her head and smiled at me sweetly, “I don’t even know your name.”  
  
  “Marcus Hardy”  
  
  “Well Marcus Hardy, I’m Willow Montgomery but everyone calls me Low. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”  
  
  “Likewise”  
  
  “So, you’re a friend of Preston’s.”  
  
  I nodded, “Yes but don’t hold it against me.”  
  
  She laughed for the first time and the sudden pleasure from such a simple sound startled me. I liked hearing her laugh.  
  
  “I won’t. Preston isn’t all that bad. He likes to use those pretty boy looks of his to get his way but I’m safe from his attention. Cage would kill him if he decided to bat his baby blues at me.”  
  
  Was it because of Preston’s womanizing or the fact he was a guy that made Cage protective of Willow. Did he really expect her to wait around until he was ready to settle down and marry her?  
  
  “LOW,” Cage’s voice rang out as the door to the apartment swung open. His head snapped around and his eyes went straight to Willow.  
  
  “God baby I was so afraid you’d leave, come here.” This was a side of Cage I’d never seen. Apparently the sweet little red head got to him in a way no one else could. He pulled her up into his arms, reached down and grabbed the forgotten suitcase then led her back to his bedroom whispering to her the entire way. If she hadn’t informed me that she refused to have sex with him earlier I’d have been eat up with righteous fury at the idea of him touching someone so sweet after having just left the bed of not one but two girls. But instead, I was eaten up with envy because I knew he was going to get to hold her and listen to her musical voice as she spilled out all her problems. He’d be the one to fix them, not me. I’d just met her. Why the hell did that bother me?  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  Willow  
  
  I glanced down at Cage sprawled out on the floor beside me. He’d somehow managed to find a few blankets and a pillow last night when he’d returned from his two a.m. booty call. He reeked of whiskey and sex. I didn’t allow him to sleep next to me when he’d been out screwing some nameless chick, crazy boy. I resisted the urge to reach down and brush the long black hair out of his eyes. I needed to leave and if I woke him up he’d stop me. My sister was expecting me to keep my niece Larissa today. I was still furious with her but Larissa was a baby and she needed me. She couldn’t help the fact her mommy was a selfish brat.  
  
  I took the quilt off the bed as I stood up and gently covered Cage’s half naked body. He’d stripped down to his boxers last night in his attempt to get rid of his smoke, whiskey, and cheap women infested clothing. Didn’t matter he still smelled like all those things. The ridiculously chiseled body of his was always a golden brown. His mother had been one hundred percent Indian and it was obvious in his features. The intense blue eyes of his had to be the only thing his dad gave him genetically and physically. That was one of the many bonds Cage and I shared, absent fathers.  
  
  My suitcase held the only three clean outfits I currently had. My dirty clothes were piled up over in the corner of Cage’s room in a plastic laundry basket. I really needed to make time to do the laundry. Grabbing a pair of jeans and a “Hurricane’s Baseball” t-shirt Cage had given me from my meager supply of clothing, I dressed quickly and quietly. After I’d brushed my hair, I closed my suitcase and threw my clothing from last night into the dirty clothes basket.  
  
  Gently closing the bedroom door behind me so I didn’t wake him, I turned and headed for the fridge. I needed some coffee and I wanted to leave some ready for Cage when he woke up. Lord knows he’d need it after his late night.  
  
  “I thought you left last night.”  
  
/>   I spun around to see Marcus Hardy sitting at the kitchen table with a newspaper and a cup of coffee already in his hands. I really wish he wasn’t so dang gorgeous. Marcus Hardy wasn’t in my league or even my atmosphere. How Cage had landed a Hardy for a roommate, I had no idea. Preston must be really tight with Marcus which seemed odd since Preston grew up much like Cage and me.  
  
  “Um, no, that was Cage that left last night.”  
  
  Marcus frowned that disapproving frown I’d seen last night again. He really didn’t get Cage and me at all. I wasn’t sure if he was judging me or Cage but it annoyed me. Even though he had the prettiest green eyes I’d ever seen on a guy in my life.  
  
  “Cage isn’t here?”  
  
  I shook my head, “No, he’s back. He had a um, call last night and he went out. He got back a few hours ago.”  
  
  “So he left you here while he went... out”  
  
  I sighed and reached for a coffee cup.  
  
  “Yep”  
  
  “I was going to make me some eggs and toast. You want some?”  
  
  That hadn’t been the response I’d expected. I was sure he was going to beat this thing with Cage and me into the ground. Instead, he was offering to fix me breakfast.  
  
  “No thanks, I’ve got to go keep my niece today.” I held up the coffee mug in my hand, “I take mugs full of coffee with me when I leave but I always bring them back.”  
  
  Marcus shrugged, “No worries. They aren’t mine anyway.”  
  
  “I know. I bought them for Cage when he got this place.”  
  
  Marcus stood up and walked over to the fridge and began getting eggs and butter out. If I was honest with myself I really wanted to stand here and watch him cook. Then eat breakfast with him and see if I could make him smile. I felt sure he had a really nice smile. Those green eyes would probably twinkle.  
  
  “If you’re sure you can’t stay. My cooking is pretty damn impressive.”  
  
  Marcus reached over to open the drawer beside me. The clean soap smell mixed with coffee and something else that reminded me of warm summer days met my nose. I fought the urge to grab his shirt and take a deeper whiff. He’d think I was crazy. I’d always thought the way Cage smelled when he came home from celebrating a victory game was the best smell in the world. But Cage’s sweat, beer, and cigarettes couldn’t compete with clean Marcus Hardy.  
  Okay, I needed to go.  
  
  “Um, okay, I gotta run. Thanks again and I’ll take you up on breakfast another time. I’ve got to get to my sister’s place before she comes over here with my niece in tow.”  
  
  Marcus glanced up and a small frown puckered his brow. He seemed concerned. If the guy only knew this was the least of my problems. I wondered what he would think if he knew I actually had nowhere to live. My sister’s couch and Cage’s bed were the only options I had for now. Somehow I knew he’d want to fix that and it warmed me. Shaking my head from my illusions of Marcus, I stepped around him and his yummy goodness then headed for the door.  
  
  “You gonna be okay?” He called as my hand touched the handle. A smile tugged at my lips. I was right. He did care. But then guys like Marcus wanted to save the world.  
  
  “Yep,” I replied glancing back over my shoulder to flash him a smile before stepping outside and heading to my reality.  
  
  “Where the HELL have you been? No wait don’t tell me. You’ve been in Cage York’s bed again. You know you have no right judging me when you go sleeping with that male whore.”  
  
  I bit the inside of my cheek to keep from screaming. My sister was so uninvolved in my life she didn’t have a clue how off track she was. Yes, Cage was probably considered a male whore but he did pick really hot sexy females to screw around with. He had pretty high standards. Which never ceased to amuse me that people thought I was one of his many conquests. I didn’t fit the profile, at all. For starters he kept me around. He never kept a girl around after he slept with her. Second, I wasn’t nearly tall enough, I was red headed, and my hips were too big, and my chest too real. Cage had a thing for fake boobs. Strange but true. Anyway, my sister was the walking persona of the kind of girl Cage went after. Granted she had red hair too, but hers was naturally curly and she was tall and thin. Red hair looked better on her than it did me. She made red sexy. Me, not so much.  
  
  “I’m here now. Just go and stop cursing and yelling in front of Larissa. It took me an entire week to get her to stop saying s-h-i-t when she dropped things”  
  
  If I wasn’t so worried about the fact it might become a permanent word in her vocabulary I would’ve found it funny. She would sit in her high chair and drop one cheerio at a time. Each time one bounced on the cracked linoleum she’d yell “SHIT” and clap her hands and do it again. This was all thanks to my lovely sister yelling “shit” every time Larissa dropped her food onto the floor. So, my niece had decided to make a game of it.  
  
  “Whatever, it was funny. I gotta go. Call Janet Hall, the lady with the sponge rollers always in her yellow hair that lives three houses down and ask her if she can watch Larissa tomorrow. You’ve got class tomorrow, right.”  
  
  I nodded, “Yes.”  
  
  I hated leaving Larissa with the cat lady. She’d come home with several scratches from the thousands of cats in that house last time she stayed there, not to mention the place smelled like cat poo. But I couldn’t miss a class or make less than a B in any of my courses or I’d lose my scholarship. I needed that scholarship. Faulkner was a junior college and that was all the college I would get. Once my scholarship was up I wouldn’t be furthering my education. Unless I could manage a student loan and considering I didn’t even have a home that seemed unlikely.  
  
  “Okay, I’m gone. Don’t call my cell while I’m at work. If you have any problems just figure them out.”  
  
  And she was gone. No kiss goodbye to Larissa. I hated her for that if nothing else.  
  
  My mother died of cancer when I was twelve leaving me and my sister alone in the world. Tawny had been eighteen and she’d taken custody of me and luckily the house was paid for thanks to Mom’s frugal budgeting over the years. The house had been left to Tawny along with the meager amount of money in the bank. She’d gotten her GED instead of finishing her senior year and managed to get a job to pay the bills. Once I was old enough to work I got an after school job to help out. Then Larissa came along a little over a year ago and everything got harder. Tawny told me she couldn’t support me any longer and I needed to get my own place. I couldn’t afford my own place on a waitress’s income. So, she decided that if I took care of Larissa for her while she worked she’d let me stay a night free of rent in return. Problem is she doesn’t need me to keep Larissa every day and when I don’t keep Larissa she doesn’t let me stay the night.  
  
  Sounds harsh but the truth is I am more than positive Larissa’s dad comes around those nights and she doesn’t want me to know who he is. If it wasn’t for her secret of who Larissa’s daddy is, I am pretty sure she’d let me stay. But I get booted for a guy. At first I went to the Methodist church because they have a homeless shelter but when Cage found out I was going there because Tawny wasn’t letting me stay at home anymore he flipped.  
  
  Now, I go to his place instead. I tried to fight him on it just because of his crazy notion we’re going to get married but I need him. Even if he is possessive and insane at times, he takes care of me. No one else ever has. He likes knowing he has the ability to take care of someone.  
  
  When Cage’s grandmother passed away she left him everything she had saved and tucked inside her mattress. Cage had never even met the woman because his mom had run away from home when she was sixteen and never gone back. It had been a surprise when Cage received a check for over two hundred thousand dollars. The first thing Cage did with the money was buy his apartment. He figured it was a good investment and he wanted some security. The rest of the money he put in the bank and only draws the interest. He’s been trying to get me to move in with him ever since.  
  
  “Lowlow out,” Larissa demanded as she banged her small pudgy fist on the tray of her highchair. Lately she’d gone from calling me Mama to Lowlow. It infuriated Tawny when she called me Mama. I’d had to work on breaking her of that habit.  
  
  “Yes, I’ll get you out but first let’s wash the banana off your hands.”  
  
  Marcus  
  
  “When did Low leave,” Cage grumbled as he stepped out of the bedroom door an hour after Willow had left. I could smell the whiskey on his breath from across the room. How’d she sleep near that?  
  
  “About an hour ago.”  
  
  He nodded and pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. I tried to appear as if I was focused on the screen of my lap top instead of curious about what he was going to say to her.  
  
  “Hey baby, why’d you leave without waking me?”  
  
  “Aw come on. You know I’d wake up for you.”  
  
  “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have left you.”  
  
  “No, I shouldn’t have. I thought you were sleeping.”  
  
  “I want you to come back here tonight and please take the key. I keep leaving it out for you. I don’t like you having to stay with her and God help me if I find out you’re going back to that damn shelter.”  
  
  “I’ll come get you myself if you don’t get your ass over here tonight.”  
  
  “I got a game tonight. You want to come? I promise to leave with you after.”  
  
  “Okay fine. But come here. If you need rest so badly before class tomorrow then get your sexy ass over here and go to bed. I promise not to stink tonight.”  
  
  Cage chuckled and hung up the phone.  
  
  “That girl’s gonna drive me nuts, I swear.”  
  
  I glanced up from my computer screen. Cage was pouring himself a cup of coffee.  
  
  “Did she get some coffee before she left?”  
  
  “Yeah, she did.”  
  
  He nodded and leaned back against the counter.  
  
  “She look upset or tired?”  
  
  She looked defeated but I didn’t want to tell him that. Not because I was worried about him but I didn’t think she’d want me to point out that observation.  
  
  “She seemed fine.”  
  
  I thought about the part of his phone conversation where he’d brought up a shelter. My insides cringed at the thoughts of Willow sleeping at a shelter.  
  
  “What did you mean about her going to a shelter?”  
  
  Cage cursed and shook his head, “That sister of h  
ers is mean as hell. She’s basically kicked Low out. I didn’t know about it at first. I found out she was sleeping at a church in town that had some kind of homeless shelter. I was so fucking furious I could’ve killed her sister with my bare hands.”  
  
  “Where does she live then?” I had a feeling I wasn’t going to like this answer but I needed to know.  
  
  “On the days she keeps her niece her sister lets her stay the night. The rest of the time she comes here. I tried to move her into the room you’re staying in several times but she refuses. Says she can’t handle my life style full time. The only reason I didn’t press it is because I’d end up losing her. She’d see what a chicken shit I really am and I’d lose her. I can’t lose her.”  
  
  The guy was really screwed up. How did he think he was really in love with Willow if he couldn’t even stop screwing every chick with a pair of long legs and fake tits in order to take care of her and keep her safe?  
  
  “I see,” I replied even though I didn’t.  
  
  Cage chuckled and sat his coffee cup down. “Naw, I doubt you see at all.”  
  
  I didn’t respond because he was right.  
  
  The knock on the door startled me even though I’d been anticipating it for hours. Ever since Cage told me to expect Willow around seven tonight, I’d been surprisingly anxious. I’d have Willow to myself. Even though I knew it wasn’t wise I was looking forward to it. She fascinated me.  
  
  “Hey Marcus,” she smiled up at me as I opened the door wide and stood back so she could step inside.  
  
  “Hey yourself.”  
  
  “I hope I’m not interrupting your night. You can just ignore me and go about whatever you were doing. I’ll even hide out in Cage’s room if you prefer privacy or anything.”  
  
  No way.  
  
  “No, uh, I actually need some company. I’ve been working on getting my online courses set up. I need a break and an actual conversation.”  
  
  She beamed and both dimples flashed at me.  
  
  “Oh good! I brought a DVD I rented from the Red Box and some supplies for a homemade pizza.” She held up the large canvas shopping tote in her hand. Clinched in her other hand was the handle on the old suitcase. My stomach twisted at the thought of her having to carry her things around with her. And the fact such a small suitcase held all she owned. My sister’s swimsuit collection wouldn’t even fit in that thing.  
  
  “That sounds perfect.”  
  
  “How good are you at chopping veggies?”  
  
  I pushed up my sleeves and flexed my arm, “I’ve actually had some pretty good experience.”  
  
  She laughed making me feel like I’d just moved a mountain instead of agreeing to chop vegetables for her.  
  
  I followed her into the kitchen and enjoyed the view of her backside. Tonight she hadn’t covered those incredible legs with jeans. A pair of khaki shorts and a snug red tank top showcased her flawless peaches and cream skin. And that hair of hers was hanging down her back free of its pony tail. The silky waves seemed almost unreal.  
  
  “Okay, I know there is a decent knife in one of these drawers because I brought one over a couple weeks ago. You go on a scavenger hunt for it and a cutting board and I’ll get the veggies washed.”  
  
  I started looking for the knife while attempting to keep the goofy grin off my face.  
  
  “How old is your niece?” I was determined to find out more about her tonight. The girl was an enigma. She glanced back over her shoulder and smiled at me, “She turned one last month.”  
  
  I opened a drawer to find the missing knife wedged between two koozies.  
  
  “Found it.”  
  
  “Oh good. Here, start slicing up the mushrooms,” she said nodding her head toward the mushrooms lying on the towel still damp from her cleaning them.  
  
  “Yes ma’am.”  
  
  “So, how do you like living with Cage? I mean you two are absolutely nothing alike from what I can tell.”  
  
  What did she mean by that exactly? Not that I was upset she didn’t think I was a player but she obviously held Cage in some sort of high regard.  
  
  “He’s a nice guy. Rarely here. It’s been easy to find quiet time for my online classes.”  
  
  “Cage can’t stay put long. He needs to be social. He’s always been that way. When we were kids he was always on the go. So many nights he snuck in my window because he’d stayed out too late and his mom had locked him out.”  
  
  I couldn’t comprehend a parent locking their kid out of the house because they’d missed curfew. My parents were always standing at the door pacing ready to unleash their punishment if I came home late.  
  
  “Stop frowning,” she chuckled and nudged my side with her elbow. “I can practically see your thoughts. You’re friends with Preston so you know the kind of home life he had. Well most of the kids in our neighborhood had the same kind.”  
  
  I forced a smile and focused all my attention on the vegetables in front of me.  
  
  “No, yeah, I mean I know.”  
  
  That made absolutely no sense. Willow let out a soft laugh and began mixing up the pizza dough. We worked in silence and I tried hard to focus on the vegetables I was supposed to be chopping up while she kneaded and rolled out the dough. Her arms were slender but the small muscle that flexed as she pushed and pulled on the dough was literally mesmerizing. What was wrong with me?  
  
  “So, did you come home because you were tired of college life or do you have some other big plans that explain your sudden change in location?”  
  
  She wasn’t the first person to ask me this question. I’d been nailed with questions from all my friends who knew I loved life in Tuscaloosa. They also knew I had been looking forward to some space from the girl who had gotten under my skin this past summer. However, Willow was the first person I really wanted to tell the truth to, but it was too soon.  
  
  “Family stuff brought me home.”  
  
  I prepared myself for her to press further like Preston had but she just nodded and reached over to scoop a handful of the mushrooms I’d chopped and began sprinkling them onto the pizza.  
  
  “Family sure can screw things up can’t they,” her defeated tone tugged at me. Pulling her into my arms and promising her everything would be okay wasn’t the best idea since I’d probably freak her out. Instead, I just nodded and reached over to sprinkle onions on the pizza just so my arm could brush against hers.  
  
  “That was one of the best pizzas I’ve ever eaten,” I admitted after helping Willow clean up our mess in the kitchen.  
  
  “We make a good team,” she said throwing me a grin over her shoulder as she put the DVD into the player.  
  
  I sat down in the straight back chair leaving the sofa available for her. There was enough room for both of us on it but I didn’t want her to feel uncomfortable with my sitting beside her. Willow turned around and frowned at me.  
  
  “I don’t bite Marcus. You can come sit on the comfy old couch with me. That chair is incredibly uncomfortable.”  
  
  Just the opening I needed. I jumped up and sat down on the end of the couch and stretched my legs out in front of me.  
  
  “You don’t have to tell me twice. I was just being polite.”  
  
  Willow chuckled and brought a blanket over to the sofa with her. She didn’t sit at the opposite end which surprised me. Instead she sat down next to me just far enough away that our bodies didn’t touch and held up the blanket, “Wanna share?”  
  
  “Yeah,” I wasn’t the least bit cold but an offer to get under a blanket with Willow wasn’t something I was going to pass up.  
  
  “Alright,” she announced as she spread the cover out over both of us, “here we go.”  
  
  The dark room was illuminated by the television screen. The warmth from Willow’s body was so tempting. I wanted to close the distance and run my fingers through her hair. I’d been dying to see if it was as soft as it looked from the moment I’d opened the door last night to see her standing there in tears. As if reading my mind she scooted over toward me and laid her head on my shoulder.  
  
  “I hope you don’t mind but I’m a cuddler when I watch movies.”  
  
&nbs  
p; I almost choked on my words. “Uh, no I don’t mind.”  
  
  Even though she’d closed the distance I forced my arm to remain on the back of the sofa and not find its way to her hair.  
  
  “I didn’t even get a romantic comedy. I thought about you when I rented it and you don’t appear to be a romantic comedy type of guy. I went for Sci-Fi instead.”  
  
  With her snuggled up against me on the couch I would watch the damn Princess Diaries I abhorred since my sister had forced me to watch it over and over when she was little.  
  
  “Sci-fi is good,” I assured her knowing I wouldn’t be able to focus on anything with the sweet smell that reminded me of honeysuckles wafting up from her hair.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  Willow  
  
  “Low,” Marcus voice whispered in my ear. I snuggled closer to the sound and breathed deeply. He smelled so good I wanted to curl up inside his clothes.  
  
  “Low, you need to wake up,” his voice said a little louder. I stretched and opened my eyes. It took a second for my eyes to adjust to the darkness. But the first thing I saw was the very defined six pack of Marcus Hardy’s stomach peeking out from underneath the dark blue t-shirt he was wearing. My next realization was my head was in his lap.  
  
  “I’m sorry I had to wake you but it’s after two and I figured you might want to get to bed before Cage gets home.”  
  
  The warm cotton of his shirt was clasp tightly in my fist. I stared at my hand and quickly released the grip I’d had on his shirt. What the heck? Had I been trying to undress him in my sleep? God, I hoped not.  
  
  I sat up and a yawn escaped.  
  
  “I’m sorry I fell asleep on you,” I mumbled feeling my cheeks grow warm.

He's a sweetheart, though. He knows my standard for doing anything intimate is dating, and even then it's not guaranteed. He was interested in me, my likes, and who I am as a person. I should have known the red flag was him asking about a first date being a coffee date 🤦🏾‍♀️. But we never did that- instead he took me out. He did have a habit of asking what I like about him or what makes me like him (to which I would sidestep and continue our previous conversation). My sprinkle sprinkle babies, am I wrong for not feeling attracted to him anymore? This seems like a rebound situation and I've already told him when we started talking that I'm not interested in being ""part of many."" He says he's dealing with her because she came out of nowhere and ""brought up drama,"" so he was upfront so as to not hurt me. Ladies, what do we think? Help me keep my crown on.

There were no guard towers, but there were two staggered twelve-foot-tall security fences, armed patrols, and enough surveillance cameras to keep an electronic eye on virtually every millimeter of the place. Situated at the northern end of Fort Leavenworth, the United States Disciplinary Barracks sat next to the Missouri River on nearly forty rolling, forested Kansas acres, a mound of brick and razor wire cradled by a green hand. It was the only maximum-security military prison for males in the country.  
  
  America’s foremost military prison was called the USDB, or the DB for short. The Leavenworth federal penitentiary for civilians, one of three prisons on the grounds of Fort Leavenworth, was four miles to the south. Along with the Joint Regional Correctional Facility—also for military prisoners—there was a fourth privately operated prison in Leavenworth, which raised the total inmate population among the four prisons to about five thousand. The Leavenworth Tourism Bureau, apparently seeking to capitalize on any bit of notoriety to lure visitors to the area, had incorporated the prison angle into its promotional brochures with the phrase “Doin’ time in Leavenworth.”  
  
  Federal dollars rolled through this part of Kansas and jumped the border into Missouri like a flood of green paper locusts, boosting the local economy and filling the coffers of businesses that provided the soldiers with smoked ribs, cold beer, fast cars, cheap hookers, and pretty much everything in between.  
  
  Inside the DB were about four hundred and fifty prisoners. Inmates were housed in a series of escape-proof pods, including a Special Housing Unit, or SHU. The majority of inmates were here for sex-based crimes. They were mostly young and their sentences were long.  
  
  Approximately ten prisoners were kept in solitary confinement at any one time, while the remaining inmates were housed in the general population. There were no bars on the doors; they were just solid metal, with a slot at the bottom for food trays to be shoved through. This also allowed for shackles to be fitted like a new pair of iron shoes when a prisoner needed to be transported somewhere.  
  
  Unlike at some other state and federal penitentiaries around the country, discipline and respect were demanded here and given. There were no power struggles between the incarcerated and their watchers. There was the rule of military law, and the primary responses from those being held here were “Yes sir,” closely followed by “No sir.”  
  
  The DB had a death row on which currently sat a half dozen convicted murderers, including the Fort Hood killer. It also had an execution chamber. Whether any of the death row inmates would ever see the lethal injection needle would be something only the lawyers and judges could determine, probably years and millions of dollars in legal fees from now.  
  
  Day had long since passed to night and the lights from a civilian Piper plane lifting off from the nearby Sherman Airfield were almost the only evidence of activity. It was quiet now, but a violent storm front that had been on the radar for a while was howling in from the north. Another system that had sprung up in Texas was barreling toward the Midwest like a brakeless freight train. It would soon meet its northern counterpart, with devastating results. The entire area was already hunkering down in anticipation.  
  
  When the two rampaging fronts met three hours later, the result was a storm of shattering proportions, with jagged lightning slicing sideways across the sky, rain bucketing down, and winds that seemed to have no limit to their strength or reach.  
  
  The power lines went first, snapped like string by tumbling trees. Then down came the phone lines. After that more trees toppled, blocking roads. The nearby Kansas City International Airport had been shut down ahead of time, all planes empty and the terminal full of travelers riding out the storm and quietly thanking God they were on the ground instead of up in that maelstrom.  
  
  Inside the DB the guards made their rounds, or sipped their coffees in the break room, or talked in low whispers, exchanging scuttlebutt of no importance just to get through their shifts. No one thought anything of the storm outside since they were safely inside a fortress of brick and steel. They were like an aircraft carrier confronted by gale-force winds and heavy seas. It might not be pleasant, but they would easily ride it out.  
  
  Even when the regular power failed as both transformers at a nearby substation blew up, plunging the prison into momentary darkness, no one was overly concerned. The massive backup generator automatically kicked on, and that machine was inside a bombproof installation with its own underground power source of natural gas that would never run out of juice. This secondary system came on so fast the short lapse did nothing more than cause jittery fluorescents and a few pops on surveillance cameras and computer monitors.  
  
  Guards finished their coffees and moved on to other gossip, while others slowly made their way down halls and around corners and in and out of pods, making sure all was well in the world of the DB.  
  
  What finally got everyone’s attention was the total silence that came when the foolproof generator with the endless supply of energy in the bombproof installation made a noise like a giant with whooping cough, and then simply died.  
  
  All the lights, cameras, and consoles instantly went out, although some of the surveillance cameras had battery backups and thus remained on. And then the quiet was replaced with urgent cries and the sounds of men running. Communication radios crackled and popped. Flashlights were snatched from holders on leather belts and powered up. But they provided only meager illumination.  
  
  And then the unthinkable occurred: All the automatic cell doors unlocked. This was not supposed to happen. The system was built such that whenever the power failed, the doors automatically locked. Not so good for prisoners if the power failure was due to, say, a fire, but that’s the way it was, or the way it was supposed to be. However, now the guards were hearing the clicks of cell doors opening all over the prison, and hundreds of prisoners were emerging into the hallways.  
  
  There were no guns allowed in the DB. Thus the guards had only their authority, wits, training, ability to read prisoners’ moods, and heavy batons to keep order. And now those batons were gripped in hands that were becoming increasingly sweaty.  
  
  There were SOPs, or standard operating procedures, for such an eventuality, because the military had procedures for every eventuality. The Army typically had two backups for all critical items. At the DB the natural gas backup generator was considered a fail-safe. However, now it had failed. Now it fell to the guards to maintain complete order. They were the last line of defense. The first goal was to secure all prisoners. The secondary goal was to secure all prisoners. Anything else would be deemed an unacceptable failure by any military standard. Careers and along with them stars and bars would fall off like parched needles from a Christmas tree still up in late January.  
  
  Since there were far more prisoners than guards, securing all of them involved a few tactics, the most important of which required grouping them in the large open central areas, where they would be made to lie facedown. This seemed to be going well for about five minutes, but then something else happened that would make every guard dig deeper into the Army manuals and more than one sphincter—whether attached to guard or prisoner—tighten.  
  
  “We’ve got shots fired,” shouted a guard into his radio. “Shots fired, undetermined location, unknown source.”  
  
  This message was repeated down the line until it was ringing in every guard’s ears. Shots fired and nobody knew from where or by whom. And since none of the guards had guns, that meant one of the prisoners must. Maybe more than one.  
  
  Now things, already serious, morphed into something bordering on chaotic.  
  
  And then the situation became a lot worse.r />  
  The sound of an explosion flooded the interior of pod number three, which contained the SHU. Now the borderline chaotic leapt right into utter meltdown. The only thing that could restore order was an overwhelming show of armed force. And there were few organizations in the world that could do overwhelming armed force better than the United States Army. Especially when that gunned-up force was right next door at Fort Leavenworth.  
  
  Minutes later, six green Army trucks swept through the powerless boundary gates of the DB, whose high-tech intrusion detection systems had been rendered inoperable. Military police in SWAT gear and carrying shields poured off the trucks, their automatic weapons and shotguns racked and ready. They charged straight into the facility, their fields of vision bright and clear owing to their latest-generation night-vision goggles that made the blackness inside the prison look as fresh and vibrant as anything on an Xbox.  
  
  Prisoners froze where they were. Then those who were still standing immediately lay facedown, their hands behind their backs and their limbs trembling in the face of superbly trained soldiers loaded for war.  
  
  Order was eventually achieved.  
  
  Army engineers were able to restore power and the lights came back on and doors could lock once more. In the meantime, the MPs from Fort Leavenworth turned the facility back over to the guards and left the way they had come. The prison commander, a full colonel, gratefully exhaled as the weight of the world, or at least a sudden wall appearing between him and his next promotion, was lifted.  
  
  Prisoners shuffled back into their cells.  
  
  A head count was done.  
  
  The list of prisoners accounted for was compared to the official list of inmates. Initially, the numbers tallied.  
  
  Initially.  
  
  But on further inspection that did not turn out to be the case.  
  
  There was one prisoner missing. Only one. But he was an important one. He had been sent here for life. Not because he had fragged an officer or otherwise killed one or many. Or because he had raped, slashed, burned, or bombed. He was not on death row. He was here because he was a traitor, having betrayed his country in the area of national security, which was a term that made everyone sit up and look over their shoulder.  
  
  And even more inexplicably, on the cot in the missing prisoner’s cell was someone else—an unidentified dead man lying facedown under the covers. This was the cause of the initial miscount of heads.  
  
  They searched every corner of the DB, including the air ducts and any other crevices they could think of. They raced outside into the now dying storm to search there, marching in methodical columns, leaving nothing unexamined.  
  
  But this plot of Kansas soil did not yield what they were looking for.  
  
  The inmate was gone. No one could explain how. No one could say how the dead man had come to be here. No one could make sense of any of this.  
  
  There was only one obvious fact.  
  
  Robert Puller, once a major in the United States Air Force and an expert in nuclear weaponry and cyber security, and also the son of one of the most famous fighting soldiers of them all, the now retired Army lieutenant general John Puller Sr., had escaped from the inescapable DB.  
  
  And he had left behind an unknown dead man in his place, which was even more inexplicable than how he had managed to break out.  
  
  Informed of this seeming impossibility turned stark reality, the prison’s commander lifted the secure phone in his office, and in doing so kissed his once promising career goodbye.  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  2  
  
  JOHN PULLER HAD his M11 pistol pointed at the man’s head.  
  
  A fancied-up Beretta 92—known in the military as an M9A1—was pointed right back at him.  
  
  It was a twenty-first-century duel that promised no winners and portended two fatal losers.  
  
  “I’m not taking the fall for this,” roared PFC Tony Rogers. He was a black man in his twenties with the image of a “terrible towel” and the Pittsburgh Steelers logo inked on his forearm. He was about five-nine, and had a shaved head, dumbbell shoulders, ripped arms, and beefy thighs mismatched with a high-pitched voice.  
  
  Puller was dressed in khaki pants and a navy blue windbreaker with the gold letters “CID” stenciled on the back. Rogers wore his Army Combat Uniform, or ACU, pants, regulation boots, and an Army T-shirt, with a patrol cap on his head. He was sweating though the air was crisp. Puller was not sweating. Rogers’s gaze was erratic. Puller’s eyes did not lift from Rogers’s face. He wanted to exude calm, hoping to graft it onto the other man.  
  
  The pair of soldiers had squared off in an alley behind a bar outside of Lawton, Oklahoma, home to Fort Sill and also the grave of the Indian leader Geronimo. Puller had been to Lawton a couple of times before, and his father had been briefly stationed there once during his Army career. He was here now in his capacity as an agent in the Criminal Investigation Command attempting to arrest an alleged killer who wore the same uniform he did, and who was now pointing his Army-issued sidearm at him.  
  
  Puller said, “So tell me your side of the story.”  
  
  “I didn’t shoot anybody. You hear me? You are out your damn mind saying I did.”  
  
  “I’m not saying anything. I’m just here because it’s my job. You have defenses to the charges, then good for you. Use them.”  
  
  “What are you talking about?”  
  
  “I’m talking about you getting a kickass JAG lawyer to defend you and maybe you beat the charge. I know some good ones. I can refer you. But doing what you’re doing right now is not helping your case. So put the gun down and we forget all about you running away and then drawing down on me.”  
  
  “Bullshit!”  
  
  “I have a warrant for your arrest, Rogers. I’m just doing my job. Let me do it peacefully. You don’t want to die in a crummy alley in Lawton, Oklahoma. And I sure as hell don’t.”  
  
  “They’re gonna put me away for life. I got a momma to support.”  
  
  “And your mother wouldn’t want you to end it like this. You’ll get your day in court. They’ll hear your side. You can bring your mother in as a character witness. Let the legal system do its thing.” Puller said all of this in an even, calming voice.  
  
  Rogers eyed him cagily. “Look, why don’t you just get out my way so I can walk out this alley and out the damn Army?”  
  
  “We both wear the same uniform and I can try to help you, PFC. But I can’t do that.”  
  
  “I will shoot your ass. I swear to God I will. ”  
  
  “Still won’t be happening.”  
  
  “I don’t miss, man. Top marks on the damn range.”  
  
  “You fire I fire. We both go down. It’s stupid for it to end that way. I know you can see that.”  
  
  “Then let’s just call it a truce. You just walk away.”  
  
  Puller gave one shake of the head while his gaze and gunsight held on Rogers. “I can’t do that.”  
  
  “Why the hell not?”  
  
  “You’re in the artillery, Rogers. You have a job to do, right? One that the Army spent a lot of time and money drilling into you, right?”  
  
  “Yeah, so what?”  
  
  “Well, this is my job. And my job doesn’t let me walk away. Now, I don’t want to shoot you, and I don’t think you want to shoot me, so put the gun down. It’s the smart thing to do. You know that.”  
  
  Puller had tracked the man to this location after finding more than enough evidence to put him away for a long time. However, Rogers had spotted Puller and made a run for it. That run had ended in this alley. There was no way out other than the way they’d entered.  
  
  Rogers shook his head. “We both gonna die, then.”  
  
  “It does not have to end like that, soldier,” retorted Puller. “Use your brain, Rogers. Guaranteed death, or a trial where you might get some time in DB—or where you might even walk away? Which sounds better to you? Which would sound better to your mother?”  
  
  This seemed to strike a chord with Rogers. He blinked rapidly and said, “You got family?”  
  
  “Yeah, I do. I’d like to see them again. Tell me about your family” />  
  Rogers licked his chapped lips. “Momma, two brothers, and three sisters. Back in Pittsburgh. We’re Steeler fans,” he added proudly. “My daddy was there when Franco caught the Immaculate Reception.”  
  
  “So put the gun down and you can still watch the games.”  
  
  “You ain’t listening, dammit! No way I’m going down for this. See, that dude drew down on me. It was self-defense.”  
  
  “Then make that claim at your court-martial. Maybe you walk away free.”  
  
  “That’s not gonna happen and you know it.” He paused and studied Puller. “You got stuff on me or you wouldn’t be here. You know about the damn drugs, don’t you?”  
  
  “My job is to bring you in, not pass judgment.”  
  
  “This is the middle of nowhere, man. Need some juice to get by. I’m a city guy. I don’t like cows. And I’m not the only one.”  
  
  “You’ve got a good record in the Army, Rogers. That’ll help you. And if it was self-defense and the jury believes you, you’re home free.”  
  
  Rogers shook his head stubbornly. “My ass is gone. You know it, I know it.”  
  
  Puller quickly thought of some way to defuse the situation. “Tell me something, Rogers. How many drinks did you have in the bar?”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Simple question. How many drinks?”  
  
  Rogers tightened his grip on the pistol as a bead of sweat ran down his left cheek. “Pitcher of beer and a shot of Beam.” He suddenly yelled, “What the hell does that matter? You messin’ with me? Are you messin’ with me, asshole!”  
  
  “I’m not messing with you. I’m just trying to explain something to you. Will you listen to what I have to say? Because it’s important. It’s important to you.”  
  
  Puller waited for him to answer. He wanted to keep Rogers engaged and thinking. Thinking men rarely pulled triggers. Hotheads did. “Okay, what?”  
  
  “That’s a fair amount of alcohol you’ve had.”  
  
  “Shit, I can drink twice that and still drive a Paladin.”  
  
  “I’m not talking about driving a Paladin.”  
  
  “Then what?” demanded Rogers.  
  
  Puller continued in a calm tone, “You’re about a hundred and seventy pounds, so even with the adrenaline spike I’m guessing that your intoxication level is about a point one, and maybe higher with the shot of Beam. That means you’re legally too drunk to drive a moped, much less a twenty-seven-ton howitzer.”  
  
  “What the hell’s that got to do with anything?”  
  
  “Alcohol impairs fine motor skills, like the kind required to aim and fire a weapon properly. With what you’ve had to drink, we’re talking a serious degradation of marksmanship skills.”  
  
  “I sure as hell ain’t missing your ass from ten feet.”  
  
  “You’d be surprised, Rogers, you really would be. I calculate you’ve lost at least twenty-five percent of your normal skill level in a situation like this. On the other hand, my aim and fine motor skills are perfect. So I will ask you once more to put down your weapon, because a twenty-five percent reduction pretty much ensures that this will not end well for you.”  
  
  Rogers fired his gun at the same time he yelled, “Fu—.” But he was unable to complete the word.  
  
  CHAPTER  
  
  3  
  
  JOHN PULLER DROPPED his duffel on the floor of his bedroom, took off his cap, wiped a bead of sweat off his nose, and dropped onto the bed. He’d just gotten back from the investigation at Fort Sill. The result had been his tracking down PFC Rogers in that alley.  
  
  And when Rogers, despite Puller’s requests for him to stand down, had started to squeeze the trigger of his Army-issued sidearm, Puller had stepped slightly to the right while narrowing his target silhouette and firing at the same time. He hadn’t actually seen Rogers start to pull the trigger. It was the look in the man’s eyes and the curse that had started coming out of his mouth—only half finished because of the M11’s punch. Rogers was true to his word—he wasn’t leaving the alley without a fight. Puller had to admire him somewhat for that. He was no coward, although maybe it was just the Jim Beam talking.  
  
  Rogers’s round had slammed into the brick wall behind Puller. The slug’s impact chipped off a sliver of brick that shot out and ripped a hole in Puller’s sleeve but drew no blood. Uniforms could be mended with thread. Flesh could too, but he’d take the hole in the uniform over one in him.  
  
  He could have killed Rogers with a headshot, but while the situation was dire, he had been in worse. He pointed his gun downward and shot the PFC in the right leg just above the knee. Shots in the torso allowed someone to fire back because sometimes they didn’t completely incapacitate. Shots around the knee region, however, reduced the toughest men to screaming babies. Rogers dropped his weapon, fell to the ground, and shrieked, clutching his damaged leg. The man would probably walk with a limp for a long time, but at least he would be alive.  
  
  Puller had triaged the man he’d shot, called in the paramedics, ridden to the Army hospital with the wounded man, and even let Rogers try to crush his hand when the pain got too bad. Then he had filled out the requisite mountain of paperwork, answered a slew of questions, and finally jumped on a military transport flight for home.  
  
  The man Rogers had shot down in the street after a drug deal gone bad now had some semblance of justice. The Rogers family back in Pittsburgh had a son and brother to support and cry over. The Steelers would still have a fan to cheer them on, albeit from an Army stockade. It shouldn’t have happened. But it had. Puller knew it was either him or the other man. Still, he always preferred to put the cuffs on instead of pulling the trigger. And shooting a fellow soldier, criminal or not, didn’t sit well with him.  
  
  All in all, a pretty crappy day’s work, he concluded.  
  
  Now he simply needed some shut-eye. All he was asking for was a few hours. Then it was back on duty, because at CID you were really never off duty, though he would be confined to a desk while an incident investigation was performed over his use of extreme force in that alley. But after that he would just go where they told him to go. Crime did not keep a schedule, at least to his knowledge. And because of that he had never punched a time clock during his Army career, because combat wasn’t a nine-to-fiver either.  
  
  Puller had barely closed his eyes when his phone buzzed. He looked at the screen and groaned. It was his old man. Or, more accurately, it was the hospital calling on behalf of his father.  
  
  He dropped the phone on the bed and closed his eyes once more.  
  
  Later, tomorrow, maybe the next day, he would deal with the general. But not now. Right now he just wanted some sack time.  
  
  The phone started buzzing again. It was the hospital. Again. Puller didn’t answer it and the phone finally stopping ringing.  
  
  Then it started buzzing again.  
  
  These pricks are just not going to give up.  
  
  And then his next thought was jolting. Maybe his father had … But no, the old man was too stubborn to die. He’d probably outlive both his sons.  
  
  He sat up and grabbed the phone. The number on the screen was different. It wasn’t the hospital.  
  
  It was his CO, Don White.  
  
  “Yes sir?” he answered.  
  
  “Puller, there’s a situation. Maybe you haven’t heard.”  
  
  Puller blinked and then tied his CO’s ominous statement to the calls from the hospital. His father. Was he really dead? It couldn’t be. Fighting legends didn’t die. They just… were there. Always.  
  
  His voice dry and scratchy, he said, “Heard what, sir? I just got back in town from Fort Sill. Is it my father?”  
  
  “No, it’s your brother,” said White.  
  
  “My brother?”  
  
  His brother was in the most secure military prison in the country. Now Puller’s mind turned to other possibilities involving his sibling.  
  
  “Has he been injured?” Puller didn’t know how that could be. There were no riots at the DB. But then again, one of the guards had slugged Bobby once, for a reason he had never shared with his brother.

I am an introverted young woman. I am pivoting from a field I was once passionate about to a male-dominated one. It's hard to find a job in either field and it's apparent the best way in is if you know somebody. I've seen posts about people getting hired by friends of friends just meeting them in a casual setting (parties, restaurants, etc) and being offered positions without a long hiring process. How do I find someone willing to hire me?

I've done:

* Applying online, both directly and through 3rd party websites like Indeed/LinkedIn (1000s of apps)
* Cold emailing, cold messaging HR/recruiting staff with my resume or portfolio
* Job fairs
* Staffing agencies (^(They generally are only looking for manual laborers locally or tenured/c-suite people remotely. I'm overquaified when I speak to someone locally but I can't find one that will take me seriously as a young grad looking online.))
* Carrying around my resume to give to organizations in the field(s) I'm trying to move away from. (The male-dominated field I want to break into tends to be headquartered in wealthy cities, otherwise mostly remote.)
* Applied or showed interest in full-time, part-time, freelance, and contractor roles

It would be a miracle to bump into someone who could vouch for me or hire me. My friends are in completely different fields on the opposite side of the country. To be honest, many places you would meet someone with any pull, I can't really afford to be at those places. My portfolio has intrigued people enough to consider me, but no one seems to be hiring. People generally take free labor in the form of ""project assessments,"" and then ghost.

I am very shy. I've cold messaged and cold emailed for jobs, but I've never asked anyone to meet for coffee. I definitely wouldn't know how to do it in a male-dominated field where someone could get the wrong impression. Casually asking someone for a job in a social setting feels like begging and I don't want that to be the impression I make.

I don't really have time for applying for months (I'm actually in a dire living situation). I did customer service between jobs or to supplement income, but I lost my last one (the place closed), and I just can't do customer service anymore. I did it throughout school and I can't anymore. I need the flexibility of this role to give me a life. I truly can't afford to have a life with the way things have been.

I don't know how to make someone want to hire me without formally sending them my portfolio. I've done what I can think of, I'm not sure how to get a real shot full-time. I don't know what to do to make someone want to hire me immediately. I know I could do the job well and progress if I just got a stable client or employer. I *just* need to get my foot in the door.

## Key Features Analysis

The tables with four legs available in 2025 boast a range of innovations and variations on classic designs. Understanding these features is key to making an informed purchase.

**Material Composition:** the primary material dictates the table's durability, aesthetics, and maintenance requirements. Tables can be crafted from solid wood (oak, maple, walnut), engineered wood (MDF, plywood), metal (steel, aluminum), glass, or even composites like resin. Each material offers a unique blend of strength, visual appeal, and price point. As an example, solid wood tables provide a classic warmth and longevity but require regular upkeep, while metal tables offer robustness and a modern aesthetic but might feel cold to the touch.

Tables made of solid wood offer timeless beauty, with each piece having its own unique grain pattern. They are durable and can last for generations with proper care. Engineered wood tables, such as those made with MDF or plywood, provide a more cost-effective option while still offering stability and versatility. Metal tables, frequently enough crafted from steel or aluminum, are known for their strength and resistance to wear, making them ideal for high-traffic areas. glass tables offer a sleek and modern look, but they require careful handling to prevent scratches and chips. Composite tables blend materials for specific advantages like weather resistance or ease of cleaning.

**Shape and Dimensions:** Table shape and size should complement the room's layout and anticipated use.Common shapes include rectangular, square, round, and oval.Rectangular tables are versatile and ideal for larger gatherings, while square tables work well in compact spaces. Round tables promote conversation and create a more intimate setting, and oval tables combine the benefits of both rectangular and round designs while saving space. Dimensions should be carefully considered to ensure adequate seating or workspace.

The size of a table should be proportionate to the room it will occupy. A large rectangular table can dominate a small dining room, while a small round table might get lost in a spacious living room. The height of the table is also important, especially if it will be used for dining or work. A standard dining table height is around 30 inches, while a coffee table is typically around 16-18 inches. Knowing the dimensions of your space and the intended use of the table will help you choose the right shape and size.

**Leg design and Stability:** The leg design of a four-legged table impacts both its aesthetic and stability. Options range from straight, tapered legs to curved or decorative legs. The sturdiness of the legs and their attachment to the tabletop are crucial for maintaining a stable surface. Look for tables with legs that are securely fastened and evenly distributed to prevent wobbling or tipping.

Straight, tapered legs provide a minimalist and modern look. Curved or decorative legs can add a touch of elegance or vintage charm. The material and construction of the legs also play a role in stability. Solid wood legs are generally more sturdy than hollow metal legs. The way the legs are attached to the tabletop is also important; look for tables with legs that are bolted or screwed into a reinforced frame to prevent them from coming loose over time.

**Finish and Coating:** The finish applied to a four-legged table enhances its appearance and protects it from wear and tear. Common finishes include varnish, lacquer, paint, stain, and oil. The choice of finish affects the table's resistance to scratches, spills, and fading. Some finishes are more durable and require less maintenance than others.

Varnish provides a durable and glossy finish that is resistant to scratches and spills. Lacquer offers a similar level of protection but is often more expensive. Paint can be used to create a wide range of colors and effects, but it may be more susceptible to chipping or scratching. Stain enhances the natural beauty of wood while providing some protection. Oil finishes penetrate the wood and provide a natural, matte look, but they require regular maintenance. The best finish for your table will depend on your personal preferences and the intended use of the table.

**Weight Capacity:** A table's weight capacity indicates the maximum load it can safely support. This is particularly important for dining and workspace tables. Overloading a table can lead to structural damage or collapse. Manufacturers typically specify the weight capacity; it's essential to consider this factor based on the anticipated items placed on the table.

A small coffee table might only need to support a few books and a cup of coffee, while a large dining table needs to be able to hold plates, cutlery, serving dishes, and possibly heavy centerpieces. A workspace table might need to support a computer, monitor, keyboard, and other office equipment. When choosing a table, consider the heaviest items that you are likely to place on it regularly and choose a table with a weight capacity that exceeds that weight by a comfortable margin.

**Style and aesthetics:** four-legged tables come in various styles, from classic and traditional to modern and industrial.The style should complement the surrounding decor and personal taste. Consider factors like color,texture,and design details when selecting a table that aligns with the overall aesthetic of the room.

A traditional-style table might feature intricate carvings, ornate legs, and a rich wood finish. A modern-style table might have clean lines, a minimalist design, and a neutral color palette. An industrial-style table might incorporate metal accents, exposed hardware, and a distressed finish. Choosing a table that complements the existing furniture and decor in your room can create a cohesive and visually appealing space.

1mswzdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tomasino/comments/1mswzdu/its_so_sad_na_women_are_still_getting_blamed_for/,it’s so sad na women are still getting blamed for the actions of men :(,"It’s been a while since I’ve been in UST and honestly, I just feel like my image and potential—yung chance ko to build solid friendships, connections, and experience the college life—was ruined just because I was being friendly and naive sa mga galawan ng lalaki. I always try to give people the benefit of the doubt.

I had this guy blockmate who I thought was simply being nice. He would constantly ask for paper, borrow a ballpen, or initiate a small talk. This was freshie first sem so everyone’s getting to know each other pa so, I didn’t think anything of it, kasi siya naman yung lumalapit and I, being a people pleaser, just tried to match his energy. I just wanted to make friends. Pero to my surprise, I heard from someone else that he apparently had other intentions—na he was trying to get close to me so it could be “more than friends.” And mind you, he had a girlfriend at the time. Ako rin, I was in a relationship, and my boyfriend and I were very secure with each other. I knew my boundaries. I’ve had guy friends before, so I honestly didn’t see it coming. (I’m also in a male-dominated field btw so it’s inevitable to have interactions with men)


But instead of people calling him out, I was the one framed up for his actions towards me. A woman from their circle of friends started spreading false rumors about me, saying I was “allowing” him to take advantage of me. That was the part that really hurt. If she were in my position, she would’ve known how hard it was.
This whole thing made me hit rock bottom. I was already struggling with clinical depression during my first two sems, and losing so many friends because this reached some of my friends out of the campus. I also experienced bullying during my high school years so this happening again to me really crushed me and made me relapse. I tried my best to always be present when I’m in school but most of the times when I’m alone I feel bad about myself for being alone. My blockmates started avoiding me, whispering when I was around or would talk about me when they’re out with other blockmates, sometimes I would catch them looking at me like I was some kind of joke. It’s like I was suddenly “that girl” who people thought would let a guy take advantage of her—even if I had no idea what was happening.

What makes me sad is that no one confronted me about it. I would’ve been so eager to explain and clear my name, but instead I was judged in silence. I get envy that people like them still get to enjoy their life and go on with it. I also want to have girl friends to hang out with, to go grab coffee with during vacants, or to invite to photobooths during UST events. Instead, I ended up being alone most of the time or worst not being able to experience a lot of things because I know to myself I would be probably doing it alone.

I just want to let this out because I know I didn’t do anything wrong. I hope if anyone who was part of that circle happens to read this, they’ll be more careful about how they interpret things and should stop allowing things to be so one-sided.

To my former blockmates and to that guy who ruined my chance of having real friendships and made people hate me for no reason—I wish you peace, so you won’t ever interfere another woman’s life again. :(",7,1755451739.0,Tomasino,1,0.89,False

1mswyg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerReviews/comments/1mswyg7/explore_if_homall_hfbs025_barstools_offer_real/,Explore if Homall HFBS025 Barstools Offer Real Comfort and Style,"Homall HFBS025, a sleek and modern barstool, certainly made a strong impression when I decided to test it in my kitchen. Right out of the box, I could tell this product was designed with attention to detail. The set of two bar stools arrived perfectly packaged, with all assembly pieces accounted for. Assembling them took me roughly 20 minutes per stool, and while not overly complicated, the instructions left a little to be desired in clarity. Still, with some patience and a Phillips screwdriver, I had them ready for use before my morning coffee.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**

These barstools carry a modern, minimalist elegance that seamlessly blends with various kitchen or bar setups. I went with the black PU leather finish, and this choice turned out to be spot-on for my space. The leather covering feels smooth to the touch, and its glossy appearance adds just enough sophistication without being flashy. The seats, paired with sturdy metal bases, give the stools a presence that’s both stylish and functional. Despite the compact profile, their wider seat width of 15.4 inches allows for comfortable use by people of varying body sizes. It's one of those rare furniture pieces that lifts the aesthetic of the room while being practical.

Check [Homall HFBS025 price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/p/b017vqbcl6/)

**Comfort and Ergonomics**

Comfort plays a massive role when buying seating, and these barstools take it seriously. The 3.3-inch thick high-density sponge cushion feels supportive without being overly firm, which kept me comfortable during longer seating durations like when catching up on work or having a drawn-out dinner chat. The lumbar support is another fantastic addition. It helped ease strain on my lower back, making the stools feel ergonomically sound—something I appreciated after years of neglecting posture. The height adjustment feature worked smoothly using the hydraulic system, allowing me to customize the stool's height to suit different counters. This is especially useful when balancing between a higher kitchen counter and a more standard-height workstation.

**Stable and Durable Construction**

Durability was another concern I had, particularly because barstools often see heavy use in my house. These stools surprised me with their robust construction. The sizable metal base feels solid, and the built-in non-scratch plastic ring protected my hardwood floor impeccably over weeks of testing. There wasn’t a single wobble, even when my nephew got a bit fidgety during lunch, a testament to the quality of the gas lift and overall build. At 30.4 pounds per set, they are reasonably lightweight but don’t feel flimsy. I especially like the wide base as it's broad enough to provide stability, even for taller individuals leaning back.

**Versatility and Use Cases**

I’ve tested these stools not just at the kitchen counter but also by moving them around to see how they function in other areas of the house. They proved to be versatile enough for multiple settings. I placed one in my living room as extra seating during a board game night, and it fit the modern aesthetic beautifully. It’s also worth mentioning that the swivel feature (rotating 360 degrees) is handy for casual gatherings or when multitasking in a home-bar setup. If you’re hosting dinner parties or group events often, the adaptability of these stools is an absolute boon.

**Pluses**

- Adjustable height with a hydraulic lift that operates smoothly  
- PU leather cushion that’s both stylish and easy to clean  
- Enhanced lumbar support for long-term seating comfort  
- Stable, wobble-free design with a wide base and floor-protecting base ring  

**Critiques**

- Assembly instructions could’ve been clearer, especially for less handy individuals  
- Black PU leather, while stylish, may start showing wear and tear over time if used roughly  
- The stools are “armless,” which isn’t ideal for all preferences  
- Slight limitation in style options for those wanting something other than leather  

**Competing Products**

Compared to similar options from higher-end brands like Zinus or Flash Furniture, these barstools hold their own surprisingly well. While Zinus may edge ahead with their cushioned armrest designs, the Homall HFBS025 outperforms them in overall versatility and floor protection. I also found Flash Furniture products more expensive, and while they offer premium looks, they don’t justify the price hike when the Homall stools match their practicality and modern aesthetic nearly point-for-point. The PU leather cover on this stool may not last as long as genuine leather offered by competitors, but it hands-down wins in the easy-to-clean segment.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

For their price point, these stools are a solid investment. The fact that you get a pair of them makes the deal even sweeter. If you’re working within a mid-range budget, I honestly don’t think you’ll find anything that measures up in terms of design, comfort, and reliability. They balance affordability and quality in a way that feels like value spent wisely.

1mswwnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1mswwnn/zero_waste_lessons_learned/,Zero waste lessons learned,"Unfortunately most of my life the problems with plastic waste weren’t on my radar, despite being supposedly environmentally conscious. This all changed after reading the facts about microplastics, landfills, and plastic accumulation in our bodies. At first though I felt resigned - like nothing I could do would make a difference, and that this is all on the politicians and corporations. But in the past few months I’ve made some progress in practical ways and am beginning to feel somewhat empowered.

1) separate trash into recycling, compost, and landfill. This was probably the highest yield. I was shocked at the volume that is compostable. And by keeping food scraps from the landfill trash, the landfill trash doesn’t become smelly/attract flies anywhere near as quickly - then one bag can stay for much longer, and even use a paper bag or no trash bag at all! 

2) toiletries - this was is relatively easy. 
-laundry detergent —> laundry sheets in paper package 
-body wash —> bar soap 
-hand soap/dish soap - found a local place that refills containers 
-toothpaste tablets, bamboo toothbrush

3) restaurants/cafes
-all coffee in reusable container (not plastic)
-beer preferably on draught
-bring take out containers for any takeaway 
-avoid styrofoam at all costs  
-provide feedback (positive and negative) to businesses for their practices on this 

4) groceries (the most difficult). Had to change the routine a good bit
-reusable bags, of course
-get only produce that not packed in plastic 
-make occasionally trips to bulk section for refillable pantry items (rice, sugar, oats, flour, nuts, dried fruits, etc)
-some items plastic is unavoidable - milk carton, juice carton, etc… juices from concentrate are more efficient from a waste perspective. All this should be recyclable. 
-avoiding meat makes this process much easier and more practical, if able to do that. 
-I provided feedback to one store I left due to unavoidability of plastic packaging 

Still a lot of work to do 
1) maintain this and make it a routine( so it’s not stressful and not just a fad)
2) moving toward avoiding trash bags altogether
3) im sure more ways to do better will come up going forward.  
4) advocate to corps, politicians on policy change 

Though in the scheme of things, what I do may not make any noticeable impact, at least I am a bit empowered now.

We did not believe in sex before marriage or even dating anyone outside of the narrow version of Christianity we believed. I went to one wedding where the couple kissed for first time on their wedding night and this was held up as a great example of purity.

Then there was me. I was fat, shy, and socially awkward. No girl in the group ever showed the slightest bit of interest in me and I wasn’t exactly the kind of person to ask any of them out.

We had weekly worship services on campus. One week, a new girl came out. I’m still not sure what her deal was, but it was clear that she believed in a much more liberal version of Christianity than I did if she believed in Christianity at all. I think she came because she was trying to figure stuff out.

She was the kind of girl who thrived on breaking shy, socially awkward people out of their shell so she came and talked to me after the service. We talked for about an hour before we went our separate ways. Over the coming months, the same pattern would play out. She did not attend our services regularly - maybe once or twice a semester, but when she did, she would find me after and we would talk for a while.

Eventually, we exchanged phone numbers and shortly after, she asked if we could meet at a coffee shop. I quickly threw on a hoodie and showed up then realized I had totally misread the situation. She had a bunch of makeup on and was clearly dressed up. This was a date and I was not allowed to date her because of incompatible beliefs.

I awkwardly explained that I didn’t drink coffee so we headed out into the winter night. We walked through an empty park and wiped the snow off a bench by a lake and sat down. Just like after services, we talked for a while. This time, however, she started holding my hand and cuddled up next to me. It simultaneously felt amazing and horrible. Amazing because I’d never had a woman express the slightest bit of interest in me much less felt the intense endorphins of being cuddled up next to one. Horrible because I knew I wasn’t supposed to be doing this. We had no future together and I was not supposed to be dating this non-believer. I was leading this poor girl on.

As the night wore on, it started getting close to midnight and it was getting very cold outside. My house was nearby and she asked if she could come over and warm up. I finally got enough resolve to tell her I was tired and that we should call it a night. It took everything I had not to invite her over. We walked to my place and I drove her home. On the car ride to her house, I made it clear that we were not going to be together and we couldn’t do this again. She stopped coming to services and I graduated shortly after that and never saw her again.

We never kissed or did anything other than holding hands and cuddling. Still, I felt intensely guilty afterwards. The pleasure I felt of having her next to me, touching me was forbidden and the fact that I would derive pleasure from something so forbidden was shameful. I felt like I was leading her on throughout the night only to turn around and end it.

It was years after that before I would leave my religion, but the religious trauma still follows me and I still think about that night.",1,1755451405.0,stories,0,1.0,False

My wife and I are opening a Family Entertainment Center in the Leander, TX area (think indoor playground type of thing). What sets our place apart from others is that it will be geared as much toward the comfort of parents as fun for the kids. Because of this, we are setting up a small coffee shop within our walls that will offer a very limited, but top notch, menu of coffee beverages and pastry items. We consider this shop and the Barista that runs it, to be the central focus of the experience for the adults in the room. The Barista will be the “personality” of our business and we consider finding the right person for the job our top priority. 



Assuming that we are able to find the person that is the right fit for our establishment, our next top priority is making sure that this person is happy, content, and enjoys their experience working with us to create a very curated, comfortable, and welcoming environment for our customers.



This is where you come in, dear reader and coffee slinging extraordinaire. We’ve seen a lot of posts asking experienced Baristas about how to set their shops up. Power needs, equipment, etc.. We are the type of people that do our research until we are as educated as possible about any endeavor we choose to embark on. There are a million YouTube videos, books, websites, etc. that are amazing at giving you a metric ton of information regarding equipment, workflows, economics of running a coffee shop, etc. We’ve been down those rabbit holes for months. We have a certain budget and we have weighed all the options available for equipment and we feel we have created a workspace that flows and will be efficient. That is not the advice we are seeking from you (although we wouldn’t turn down an experienced opinion on anything). 



No, what we’re asking is this… What are the things you can only learn by doing the job? What are the things that irritate you at the job that you wouldn’t know without being on your feet for 8 hours doing it? What are the things the people you’ve worked for have done especially right? What can make the difference as a Barista that keeps you going through the rush? What do I, as the employer, need to know that my employee may not feel comfortable to tell me?



We can’t know what we don’t know and any advice that may keep our Barista happy, feeling engaged, and like they are an integral part of the bigger experience (because they absolutely will be) would be most appreciated.



Thanks in advance to anyone willing to offer their experience!! We’ve read a lot of posts here that seem like being a Barista can be a horrifying experience. Please help us prevent our future Barista from needing to vent here!

Last night I actually slept almost the whole night through for the first time in idk how long. I got up once to use the bathroom. Usually I'm up every 2-3 hours and my sleep is disturbed by overheating, bad dreams, and sometimes adrenaline rushes. Not last night. 

It makes no sense to me that it could possibly already be helping. I looked for other variables and it could be that my blood values are coincidentally doing well right now for iron/ferritin and HGB/HCT/MCV. I developed polycythemia with iron overloading over time when I hit about 47 (52 now) and only got that diagnosed recently. I have completed treatment phlebotomy and am in maintenance. I actually became iron deficient after my last 500ml blood draw and had to take supplements for a couple of weeks to feel better. 

That doesn't seem like it would have any impact on sleep. I'm also currently undertreated for t2 diabetes developed as long covid, as I switched from Ozempic to Mounjaro and had to be started at a low dose. That meant my blood sugar was not well controlled and I had to pee a lot. I was getting up a lot. I don't start the next level shot until Sunday. Even so, I slept through the night. 

I did a wash-out of caffeine to reset my tolerance by not having any caffeine/coffee for two weeks. I am back to having 1-2 cups at most in the morning. That might be helping. 

I started krill oil but that doesn't seem sleep connected.

I recently received my first batch of two bags from La Marzocco’s subscription, about two weeks after being charged. Neither bag has a roast date, and I’m struggling to dial in my shots. I’m seeing issues typical of older beans: minimal to no crema, fast pulls with significant channeling due to puck degradation. I’m grinding almost at 0.5 on my Lagom P64 with Mizen Omni burrs.
I submitted a support request with La Marzocco since there’s no direct phone line. Also, the shipment didn’t include a recipe, which I was hoping for to reduce wasted shots.

I was in one that ended really badly, and it took me a solid two years to recover from it. About two years ago, someone new joined our organization, and over time, we started talking during coffee breaks. There was this instant click, and the kind of maturity and connection I feel around them is honestly hard to put into words. Our conversations are deep, engaging, and genuinely mentally stimulating.

All my life, I’ve craved physical affection, warmth, and emotional support. I think I used to let people in because I was hoping to get those things from them. But when I met this person, I was clear with myself—I put up strong boundaries. I didn’t want any kind of physical touch or anything that could even feel like that.

Then, a couple of days ago, we were crossing the road in a hurry, and they instinctively grabbed my hand. It wasn’t just a quick grab—it lasted a few seconds. I didn’t close my palm around theirs because I didn’t want to make them uncomfortable. But man… I’ve never experienced a touch like that before. It’s not that I haven’t held hands before, but every time I did, I’d get this weird anxiety like I was doing something wrong. This time was different. It was calm. Warm. Safe.

We keep talking during breaks and honestly, hours just fly by. They’re usually super introverted, and people around us even joke about how talkative they become when I’m around. The thing is, I know they see this as just a normal friendship. They've said they're not into emotional stuff, and I don't think they have any special feelings for me.

But here’s the issue—I’ve started missing our conversations. That moment on the road. The bond. I’ve reflected a lot and I don’t think this is lust or limerence or a crush. I just genuinely miss what we have. And I'm scared that I might start falling for them, which I really don’t want.
I have people in my life who love me, but when they show it, it just doesn’t hit me the same way. It doesn’t feel meaningful. I don’t expect things from them, and I’m indifferent to their efforts. But with this person, even the smallest gestures feel like everything. I know I might find someone someday who will truly love me, but I honestly don’t think I’ll be able to feel it the way I feel this.

I can’t just cut them off—we work together. Is there a way to stay connected without letting myself fall deeper? I’d really appreciate some advice.

TL;DR: I formed a strong bond with a coworker, and despite setting boundaries, a brief moment of touch made me feel unexpectedly safe and close. I know they see it as just friendship, but I’m scared I’m starting to fall. I don’t want that, but it’s hard to stay connected without getting more attached. How do I keep this connection without letting my feelings grow deeper?",0,1755451107.0,relationships,1,0.5,False

1mswoik,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortyStories/comments/1mswoik/tdwg/,[TDWG],"You sit in the darkened control room, the glow of monitors casting harsh light across tired faces. For weeks, your team has labored over the intercepted alien transmission—an intricate weave of pulses, tones & mathematical sequences. Each line decoded feels like pulling teeth from a god.

The pressure is immense. Governments demand answers. Military leaders breathe down your neck. News leaks stir panic across the globe. The more progress you make, the more mistakes pile up—fragile patterns misunderstood, misapplied.

On day twelve, the first disaster strikes. A wrong interpretation of a frequency pattern triggers automated defense satellites, mistaking a harmless weather balloon for an incoming warhead. Thousands die in the coastal evacuation stampede. You can’t sleep that night, replaying every sound, every number, wondering if your translation caused it.

By day nineteen, your team believes the message is a warning. The urgency grows. Hospitals overflow from riots sparked by rumors of invasion. A train derailment, blamed on a “signal disruption,” kills hundreds more. Every line of alien code you crack feels like a knife to the world’s throat.

The deeper you dive, the stranger it gets. You begin to dream in their syntax—fractals spiraling endlessly, voices whispering in perfect binary. Coffee tastes like static. Your pulse syncs with the pulse of the transmission.

And then—
The breakthrough.

Your exhausted fingers finish aligning the last sequence. Everyone leans in. Your chest is tight. The final phrase emerges across the monitor, plain as day in your own language now. The room is silent.

It reads:

“DEEZ NUTZ.”

For a moment no one moves. No one breathes. The air hums with disbelief. Weeks of bloodshed, riots, sleepless nights, and the cruel machinery of paranoia—all for this.

You laugh, but it’s a broken sound, thin & high-pitched. Others don’t. Some cry. Some stare blankly. A general storms out, muttering curses.

You keep staring at the words, your brain refusing to process the absurdity. But somewhere, impossibly far away, you feel it—an alien presence watching. Waiting.

Cinn-a-drizzle by pink Victoria secret 🫤

* Smells like faint cinnamon and bread, it’s missing that sweetness/vanilla icing smell, so it’s definitely a pass. Has a big alcohol burst when first sprayed too. 

Tubees chocolate fudge 😌

* THE ONLY chocolate fragrance you need. Smells like chocolate fudge although sometimes I find it smells like ink a bit, it’s definitely not something I’d wear everyday but it rings mostly true to what it’s called. When I asked my friends what I smelled like, I got two answers vanilla & chocolate. It also lasts pretty long imo.

Victoria secret vanilla lace 😌

* Smells exactly like unsweetened vanilla extract. When I wore this I got told by friends and family “you smell like you were baking”, or “you smell like unsweetened vanilla extract” in my book that’s a big compliment! It’s a very simple and basic fragrance, can’t really go wrong with this one, lasts pretty long too I’d say 6 hours with 5 sprays 

Lattafa Eclaire 😬

* it’s MEH, nothing special. Smells like faint spices and synthetics, DEFINITELY not worth 70$! PASS. 


Pink sugar red velvet 😬

* I also hate this one, it gives me the WORST headache so it physically hurts to wear, it’s just wayyyyyy to sweet for me, which is weird because I love gourmands. When I wore this I got told I smelled like vanilla, and then was asked if I had went to a coffee shop 


PINK hair & body mist VANILLA 😌

* Smells like a calming salty vanilla breeze. Love the salty note in this. When I wore this and walked into a room a stranger said “I just got a burst of vanilla” 

PINK summer faves vanilla sundae mist 😌

* LOVE THIS, smells like vanilla bean ice cream. 🍦 very yummy!!! One of my current favourite mists

For me It’s the best one out there and it’s not even close.

I fly around Europe constantly for work (cruise industry = lots of airports), and after trying basically every airline that operates here, I always end up thinking the same thing: Ryanair just fucking works.

People complain about the “hidden fees” but Bro ain't nothing hidden? They literally tell you the dimensions of your bag. If you can’t measure your own backpack, that’s on you. I’ve never had a single issue ffs. 

Seats? Fine. It’s a 2-hour flight, not a vacation villa. 
Check-in? Easiest process ever, especially with the app. Boarding? Pay like €5 extra for priority and boom, no stress. Prices? Insanely cheap. I flew to Dubrovnik for €60. Sixty euros! That’s less than dinner in half of Europe.

Meanwhile, “proper” airlines somehow always manage to lose luggage, delay flights, or make check-in a total circus. I’ve had more headaches with Lufthansa, BA, or Air France than I can count. 

I think people just hate Ryanair because it’s trendy to hate them. Like, it’s cool to say "" Ryanair is the worst” while sipping your €8 fucking Starbucks bullshit airport coffee. But if you actually travel a lot in Europe and care about getting somewhere quickly and cheaply. Ryianair is the goooooaaaat.

It's like the perfect buffet. You get served. You get moved. You get off And the next boards the plane.

A few months ago (in my junior year going into senior) before school was out for summer, I asked out a girl. I had a few classes with her and told her I thought she was pretty and was wondering if she would go out with me. Nothing could have prepared me for when she just literally walked away and said nothing back. I literally got left on read IRL. I saw her laughing at me later with some of her friends. Ngl thats a new kind of pain. This may be copium and I hope I dont sound like an incel saying this, but if she couldn't even give a straight answer or even politely reject me, then maybe it wasn't worth it to ask in the first place.

I asked out another girl over a month and a half later who is really sweet and a good person in general. I went up to her and asked if she was interested in getting a drink with me (coffee or tea or whatever) after exams. She said she wasn't available cause she was going to hang out with another guy (by this point I was wondering if I was cooked. This guy was HUGE. He is a 6'4 guy at least and I am 5'7 and I have seen her talking to this guy but I just assumed he was a friend because she has a lot of dudes who are her friend). I asked her for her contacts and she said she will give them to me later. I didn't get them so about 4 or so days later I followed up and asked if she found another date that would work. She said she would contact me. Never added me back on anything. Should I just assume that is a polite rejection. If so I will take that over being laughed at.

This week on the show… Stay tuned to hear about the big Russian stuck in the mobile order window. 

But first… On Day 201, I reminisce about seeing the South Park movie 26 years ago, congratulate the South Park guys on another stellar takedown of the Trump administration, and unfortunately, drop the news that this latest takedown won’t matter, and it doesn’t matter that it won't matter, because what matters is you, what matters is me, what matters is freeloading coffee and gyro sandwiches with your family. We will never let the leader of the Trump administration and the Trump administration take that away from us. Of course, I mention Prince, and I really crowbar it in. You’ll see.

On Day 202, I let you in on my Saturday morning spent driving around to three grocery stores because I am so frugal (remember my real cousin paying for my coffee and gyro sandwich?) that I needed to get the best deals on my grocery list, but what inspired today’s video was was not the shopping, it was the lack of shoppers. The stores were all creepy because they were all empty. What does this have to do with Pink Floyd besides being creepy? I will talk about it so please listen to me talking about it.

On Day 203, I compare the positive messages in the songs “Walking on Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves and “Break Stuff” by Limp Bizkit as it relates to the aforementioned book that I have written and am now editing. I went through a lot of negative thoughts and feelings during this project, and I share how I took that energy and made it work for me. I don't charge you any extra than free for this advice, but you could pay $3 for thirty to forty minutes of gratitude. Wow, what a bargain!

On Day 204, I finally ask the question at the heart of every internet post about what is happening to the nation under the leader of the Trump administration and the Trump administration. What do I do? I find that almost all of the rhetoric I encounter online is full of information and speculation even from people I admire and trust, but no one seems to be able to tell me what to do about it. At least I found a way to recall the scene in Animal House, where John Belushi eats an entire hamburger in one bite on the cafeteria line. I always admired that.

On Day 205, we partake in a celebration that you should be used to now as we hit 14%, yes, 14% completion of 1461 days of ignoring the Trump administration. Also as usual, I remind us all that Kamala Harris only lost by 1%, the leader of the Trump administration didn’t even receive 50%, and my mindful, optimistic, and hopeful attitude, which sometimes wavers, still remains at 100% when it comes to believing that we will survive the Trump administration and be better for it. Most people are good, and most people want to be left alone. Let's be good and let's be left alone!

Speaking of left alone, on Day 206, I have to report some news, and that is that a senator from Utah wants to federally ban porn. If there is one thing that will make all citizens of all political persuasions revolt, that would be it. The main point I make, however, is in speculation about the sexuality of a person who would introduce such a bill. I encourage meddling, miserable meatheads like this to either live life or end it. Please do one or the other. 

Finally, on Day 207, a white gay jew, an ample bellied loud Russian and a petite, friendly Asian woman walk into a McDonalds. You'll want to stick around for this one. It is a slice of life in America that I experienced first hand and gave me a great feeling about what is actually happening in real life in our nation. When you are enjoying each other without the constant negativity of the internet, it is easy to ignore the Trump administration. ",1,1755450796.0,JoshBloom,0,1.0,False

  I LEAPT, DRAWING MY FEET UP BENEATH ME, AS the seven-foot quarterstaff smashed into the flagstones where I had been standing a half second before. Landing in a crouch, I sprang back up, groaning with the effort, and swung my own weapon over my head. Sweat dripped into my eye, blinding me for one stinging second before my reflexes took over and forced me into motion.  
  
  A shaft of light from a window far overhead illuminated the oaken staff as I arced it down toward my enemy’s legs. He swept sideways, sending my weapon flying through the air. It crashed with a wooden clang against the stone wall behind me.  
  
  Defenseless, I scrambled for a sword that lay a few feet away. But before I could grab it, I was snatched off my feet in a powerful grasp and crushed against my assailant’s chest. He held me a few inches off the ground as I kicked and flailed, adrenaline pumping like quicksilver through my body.  
  
  “Don’t be such a sore loser, Kate,” chided Vincent. Leaning forward, he gave me a firm kiss on the lips.  
  
  The fact that he was shirtless was quickly eroding my hard-won concentration. And the warmth from his bare chest and arms was turning my fight-tensed muscles to buttery goo. Struggling to maintain my resolve, I growled, “That is totally cheating,” and managed to work my hand free enough to punch him in the arm. “Now let me go.”  
  
  “If you promise not to kick or bite.” He laughed and set me on the ground. Sea blue eyes flashed with humor from under the waves of black hair that fell around his face.  
  
  He grinned and touched my cheek, with an expression like he was seeing me for the first time. Like he couldn’t believe that I was standing there with him in all my 3-D humanness. An expression that said he thought he was the lucky one.  
  
  I rearranged my smile into the best glare I could muster. “I’m making no promises,” I said, wiping the hair that had escaped my ponytail out of my eyes. “You would deserve a bite for beating me again.”  
  
  “That was much better, Kate,” came a voice from behind me. Gaspard handed me my fallen staff. “But you need to be a bit more flexible with your hold. When Vincent’s staff hits yours, roll with the movement.” He demonstrated, using Vincent’s weapon. “If you’re stiff, the staff will go flying.” We walked through the steps in slow motion.  
  
  When he saw that I had mastered the sequence, my teacher straightened. “Well, that’s good enough for sword and quarterstaff today. Do you want to move on to something less strenuous? Throwing stars, perhaps?”  
  
  I held my hands up in surrender, still panting from the exercise. “That’s enough fight training for today. Thanks, Gaspard.”  
  
  “As you wish, my dear.” He pulled a rubber band from behind his head, releasing his porcupine hair, which sprang back into its normal state of disarray. “You definitely have natural talent,” he continued, as he returned the weapons to their hooks on the walls of the underground gym-slash-armory, “since you’re doing this well after just a few lessons. But you do need to work on your stamina.”  
  
  “Um, yeah. I guess lying around reading books all day doesn’t do much for physical endurance,” I said, leaning forward to catch my breath with my hands on my knees.  
  
  “Natural talent,” crowed Vincent, sweeping my sweaty self up into his arms and pacing across the room, holding me like a trophy. “Of course my girlfriend’s got it. In truckloads! How else could she have slain a giant evil zombie, single-handedly saving my undead body?”  
  
  I laughed as he set me down in front of the freestanding shower and adjoining sauna. “I don’t mind taking all the glory, but I think the fact that your volant spirit was possessing me had just a tiny bit to do with it.”  
  
  “Here you go.” Vincent handed me a towel and kissed the top of my head. “Not that I don’t think you’re totally hot when you’re dripping with sweat,” he whispered, giving me a flirty wink. Those butterflies that suddenly sprang into action in my chest? I was beginning to consider them permanent residents.  
  
  “In the meantime, I’ll finish your job and take out that pesky nineteenth-century weapons master. En garde!” he yelled, as he flicked a sword from off the wall and turned.  
  
  Gaspard was already waiting for him with a giant spiked mace. “You’ll have to do better than that measly steel blade to make a dent in me,” he quipped, waving Vincent forward with two fingertips.  
  
  I closed the shower door behind me, turned the lever to start the water, and watched as the powerful streams spat forth from the showerhead, sending a cloud of steam up around me. My aches and pains flew away under the steady pressure of the hot water.  
  
  Incredible, I thought for the thousandth time, as I considered this parallel world I was moving in. A few Paris blocks away I led a completely normal life with my sister and grandparents. And here I was sword fighting with dead guys—okay, “revenants,” so not really dead. Since I’d moved to Paris, this was the only place I felt I fit in.  
  
  I listened to the noises of the fight coming from outside my pinewood haven and thought of the reason I was here. Vincent.  
  
  I had met him last summer. And fallen hard. But after discoverin  
g what he was, and that being a revenant meant dying over and over again, I had turned my back on him. After my own parents’ death the year before, being alone seemed safer than having a constant reminder of that pain.  
  
  But Vincent made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. He promised not to die. At least, not on purpose. Which goes against every fiber of his un-being. Revenants’ compulsion to die when saving their precious human “rescues” is more enticing and powerful than a drug addiction. But Vincent thinks he can hold out. For me.  
  
  And I, for one, hope he can. I don’t want to cause him pain, but I know my own limitations. Rather than grieve his loss over and over again, I would leave. Walk away. We both know it. And, though Vincent is technically dead, I’ll venture to say that this is the only solution we can both live with.

  TWO  
  
  “I’M HEADING UP,” I SHOUTED.  
  
  “Be right there,” answered Vincent, glancing briefly to where I stood on the stairs. Gaspard took the opportunity to smash the sword from his hands, and it went clattering across the floor as Vincent raised his hands in defeat.  
  
  “Never . . .”  
  
  “. . . take your eye from the fight.” Vincent finished Gaspard’s sentence for him. “I know, I know. But you’ve got to admit, Kate is more than a bit distracting.”  
  
  Gaspard smiled wryly.  
  
  “To me,” Vincent clarified.  
  
  “Just don’t let her distract you from saving her life,” Gaspard responded, placing his toe under the hilt of the fallen sword and, with a quick movement, flicking it up in the air toward Vincent.  
  
  “This is the twenty-first century, Gaspard,” Vincent chuckled, catching the grip of the flying sword in his right hand. “Under your tutelage, Kate will be just as capable of saving mine.” He grinned at me, lifting an eyebrow suggestively. I laughed.  
  
  “I agree,” Gaspard admitted, “but only if she can catch up with your half century of fighting experience.”  
  
  “I’m working on it,” I called as I closed the door behind me, blocking out the earsplitting clash of metal that resonated from the resumption of their fight.  
  
  I pushed through a swinging door into a large, airy kitchen and breathed in the bready aroma of freshly baked pastry. Jeanne was bent over one of the slate gray granite counters. Nominally the cook and housekeeper, she was more like a house mom. Following the example of her own mother and grandmother, she had cared for the revenants for decades. Her shoulders shook slightly as she put the finishing flourishes on a chocolate cake. I touched her arm and she turned to face me, revealing tears that she tried unsuccessfully to blink back.  
  
  “Jeanne, are you okay?” I breathed, knowing that she wasn’t.  
  
  “Charlotte and Charles are like my own children.” Her voice cracked.  
  
  “I know,” I said, putting an arm around her ample waist and leaning my head on her shoulder. “But they’re not leaving forever. Jean-Baptiste said it was just until Charles gets his head sorted out. How long could that take?”  
  
  Jeanne straightened and we looked at each other, a silent message passing between us. A long time, if ever. The boy was seriously messed up.  
  
  My own feelings about him were mixed. He had always acted antagonistically toward me, but after Charlotte had explained why, I couldn’t help but pity him.  
  
  As if reading my thoughts, Jeanne jumped to his defense. “It’s not really his fault. He didn’t mean to endanger everyone, you know.”  
  
  “I know.”  
  
  “He’s just more sensitive than the others,” she said, bending back over her cake and concentrating on the placement of a sugar-spun flower. “It’s their lifestyle. Dying over and over again for us humans and then having to leave us to our fate takes its toll. He’s only fifteen, for goodness’ sake.”  
  
  I smiled sadly. “Jeanne, he’s eighty.”  
  
  “Peu importe,” she said, making a motion like she was swatting a ball backward over her shoulder. “I think the ones who die younger take it harder. My grandmother told me that one of their Spanish kindred did the same thing. He was fifteen too. He asked the numa to destroy him, like Charles did. But that time the poor thing succeeded.”  
  
  Jeanne noticed me shudder at this mention of the revenants’ ancient enemies, and though no one else was in the kitchen, she lowered her voice. “I say it’s better than the other extreme. Some—very few, mind you—get so jaded by their role in human life and death that their rescues become only a means of survival. They don’t care about the humans they save, only about relieving their compulsion. I would prefer that Charles be overly sensitive than coldhearted.”  
  
  “That’s why I think that getting away will be good for him,” I reassured her. “It will give him some distance from Paris, and the people he has saved.” Or not saved, I remembered, thinking of the fatal boat accident that had set off Charles’s downward spiral. After failing to save a little girl’s life, he had begun acting strangely. He ended up trying to commit revenant suicide, unwittingly allowing an attack on his kindred. “Jean-Baptiste said they could visit. I’m sure we’ll see them soon.”  
  
  Jeanne nodded, hesitantly acknowledging my words.  
  
  “It’s a beautiful cake,” I said, changing the subject. I scraped a bit of icing off the platter and popped it into my mouth. “Mmm, and yummy, too!”  
  
  Jeanne batted me away with her spatula, grateful to reassume her mother-hen role. “And you’re going to ruin it if you keep taking scoops out of the side,” she laughed. “Now go see if Charlotte needs some help.”  
  
  “This isn’t a funeral, people. It’s New Year’s Eve. And the twins’ moving party. So let’s celebrate!” Ambrose’s baritone voice reverberated through the pearl gray wood-paneled ballroom, drawing amused chuckles from the crowd of elegantly dressed revelers. A hundred candles glistened off the chandeliers’ crystal prisms, casting flecks of reflected light around the room better than any disco ball could.  
  
  Tables along the edges of the room were heaped with delicacies, tiny chocolate- and coffee-flavored éclairs, melt-on-your-tongue macarons in a half-dozen pastel colors, mountains of chocolate truffles. After the enormous feast that we had just devoured, I didn’t have an inch of space inside for these masterpieces of French pastry. Which sucked. Because if I had known these were still to come, I would have skimped on the bread and skipped the cheese course.  
  
  Across the room from me, Ambrose tapped an iPod nestled inside a large speaker system. I grinned as Jazz Age music trumpeted from the sound system. Though the native Mississippian listened to contemporary music on his headphones, he had a soft spot for the music of his youth. As the gravelly voice of Louis Armstrong electrified the dancers, Ambrose grabbed Charlotte and began shimmying her around the room, her creamy complexion and short blond hair the mirror opposite of his brown skin and cropped black hair.  
  
  They made a striking couple. If only they were a couple. Which—Charlotte had recently confided in me—was something that she longed for. And which Ambrose for some reason unbeknownst to me (and maybe to himself) did not. But his brotherly affection for her was as obvious as the doting smile on his face as he swung her around and dipped her low.  
  
  “Looks like fun. Let’s have a go,” whispered a voice inches from my ear. I turned to see Jules standing behind me. “How’s your dance card look?”  
  
  “Double-check your century, Jules,” I reminded him. “No dance cards.”  
  
  Jules shrugged and gave me his most flirtatious smile.  
  
  “But if there were, shouldn’t my boyfriend have the first dance?” I teased him.  
  
  “Not if I fought him for the honor,” he joked, throwing a glance across the room at Vincent, who was watching us with a half smile. He winked at me and returned to his conversation with Geneviève, a strikingly beautiful revenant who I had once been jealous of before finding out that she was happily married.  
  
  Counting her, there were a  
few dozen revenants attending tonight’s party who were not members of La Maison. (No one referred to it by its official name, the Hôtel Grimod de la Reynière, hôtel in this case meaning ridiculously huge, extravagant mansion.) Jean-Baptiste’s residence was home to our venerable host, Gaspard, Jules, Ambrose, Vincent, and, until tomorrow, Charles and Charlotte. After their move to Jean-Baptiste’s house near Cannes, two newcomers would arrive to take their place.  
  
  “Okay. To avoid World War Three, I guess I can give the first dance to you. But if Vincent tries to cut in, you better be ready to draw your sword.”  
  
  Jules patted the imaginary hilt at his waist, then took me in his arms and swept me to the middle of the floor near Ambrose and Charlotte. “Kate, my dear, the candlelight does suit you so,” he murmured.  
  
  I blushed in spite of myself, both from the bold way he touched his cheek to mine as he whispered, and from his flattery, which—though I was unquestionably into Vincent—still managed to warm me with delight. Jules was the ultimate safe flirtation, because I knew not to take it personally. Every time I saw him out at night, he had a different gorgeous woman with him.  
  
  He pulled me close until we were practically plastered to each other. Laughing, I pushed him away. “Jules, you incorrigible rake,” I scolded in my best Jane Austen lingo.  
  
  “At your service,” he said, and bowed low before grabbing me again and whirling me around. “You know, Vincent’s not the jealous type.” Jules smiled slyly as he held me tight. “He has no reason to be. Not only is he the most handsome of our kindred, or so I’m told by every woman around, but he’s Jean-Baptiste’s second”—he paused to dip me before scooping me back into his arms—“and he’s won the heart of the most lovely Kate. There’s no fighting the Champion.

Although I couldn’t help smiling at the “lovely Kate” bit, I latched onto the new information he had given me. “Vincent is Jean-Baptiste’s second? What’s that mean?”  
  
  “It means that if anything ever happens to Jean-Baptiste”—Jules paused, looking uncomfortable, and I filled in the blank for him: if he is ever destroyed—“or if he decides to step down as the head of France’s revenants, Vincent will take his place.”  
  
  I was shocked. “Why hasn’t he told me this before?”  
  
  “Probably because of one of his other fine points: modesty.”  
  
  I took a couple of seconds to absorb the whole “second” situation before looking back into Jules’s eyes. “And what did you mean by ‘Champion’?”  
  
  “He hasn’t told you about that, either?” This time Jules looked surprised.  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Well, I’m not going to spill all his secrets in one night, then. You’ll have to ask him.”  
  
  I mentally tucked that in my to-ask-Vincent file.  
  
  “So if Jean-Baptiste steps down, Vincent will be your boss?” I said it to teasingly bait him, but paused as his expression changed from his usual lighthearted nothing-affects-me flippancy to one of fierce loyalty.  
  
  “Vincent was born for this, Kate. Or reborn, rather. I wouldn’t want the responsibility he’s going to have one day. But when the time comes, I will do anything he asks. In fact, I already feel like that, and he’s not even my ‘boss.’”  
  
  “I know that,” I said truthfully. “I can tell. Vincent’s lucky to have you.”  
  
  “No, Kate. He’s lucky to have you.” He gave me one final spin, and I realized that he had danced me across the room to where Vincent was standing. As he released my hands, he winked ruefully at me and deposited me gallantly into the arms of my waiting boyfriend.  
  
  “Still in one piece?” Vincent teased, pulling me close and planting a soft kiss on my lips.  
  
  “After dirty-dancing with Jules? I’m not sure,” I said.  
  
  “He’s harmless,” offered Geneviève.  
  
  “I take offense at that,” Jules called from the other side of the table, where he was serving himself a flute of champagne. “I consider myself very dangerous indeed.” He saluted the three of us with his glass before sauntering off toward a pretty revenant across the room.  
  
  “Have I told you how gorgeous you look tonight?” Vincent whispered, handing me my glass.  
  
  “Only about twelve times,” I said coyly, flouncing out the skirt of the floor-length pewter-colored gown Georgia had helped me find.  
  
  “Perfect, then, because thirteen’s my lucky number,” he said, and gave me an appreciative once-over. “But gorgeous doesn’t quite do you justice. Maybe . . . dazzling? Stunning? Ravishing? Yes, I think that’s better. You look ravishing, Kate.”  
  
  “Stop it!” I laughed. “You are totally doing this on purpose to see if you can make me blush! It’s not going to happen!”  
  
  Vincent smiled victoriously and brushed my cheek with his finger. “Too late.”  
  
  I rolled my eyes as the bell-like sound of a spoon being tapped against a wineglass quieted the room. Ambrose switched the music off, and everyone turned to Jean-Baptiste, who stood before the crowd in all his noble stuffiness. From the portraits decorating the room, his clothing and hairstyle could be seen to evolve over the last 240 years, but his aristocratic demeanor hadn’t changed a bit.  
  
  “Welcome, dear kindred, revenants of Paris,” he announced to the forty-odd guests. “Thank you for joining us this evening in my humble abode.” There was a stir of movement and a swell of bemused laughter.  
  
  He smiled subtly and continued. “I would like to make a toast to our beloved departing kindred, Charles and Charlotte. You will be sorely missed, and we all hope for your expeditious return.” Everyone followed Jean-Baptiste in raising his glass, and as one chimed, “Santé!”  
  
  “Well, that’s a diplomatic way to put it, when he’s the one who sent them into exile!” I whispered to Vincent, and then glanced over at Charles, who was perched uncomfortably on an ancient upholstered settee on one side of the room. Since the day he had put his kindred at risk by handing himself over to the numa, his perpetual sour, sulking expression had been replaced by one of despair and depression. Gaspard sat beside him, lending emotional support.  
  
  Jean-Baptiste continued, “I’m sure we would all like to join the twins in the sunny south, but our work is cut out for us here in Paris. As you all know, ever since our human friend Kate”—he waved his glass in my direction and nodded politely at me—“dispatched so handily our enemies’ leader, Lucien, just over a month ago, the numa have maintained complete silence. Although we have remained at the ready, there has been no attempt at vengeance. No counterattack.  
  
  “And more worryingly there have also been absolutely no numa sightings by our kindred. They haven’t abandoned Paris. But the fact that they are avoiding us on such a thorough basis is so egregiously out of character for our old foes that we can only surmise that they have a plan. Which also means that they must have a leader.”  
  
  This was a revelation to the group in the room: Their patient expressions suddenly changed to looks of consternation. Whispering began among a few, but Vincent’s steady gaze toward the speaker told me that he was already privy to this information. Jean-Baptiste’s second, I thought with a mix of wonder and uneasiness. I couldn’t wait to get Vincent on his own so I could quiz him about it.  
  
  Jean-Baptiste silenced the discussions with more spoon clinking on his glass. “Kindred, please.” Once again, the room fell silent. “We all know that Nicolas was Lucien’s second. But surely, considering his short temper and love of ostentatious gestures, if he had taken over we would have heard something by now. Silence is our clue that someone else has assumed control. And if we don’t know who we are up against, or when and where their eventual attack will come from, how can we prepare our defense?”  
  
  The murmuring started back up. This time Jean-Baptiste’s raised voice quieted the crowd. “AND SO . . . in the face of a potential critical situation, we are honored to have the assistance of the person who knows more about our history and that of the numa than anyone else in this room. The person regarded as the most knowledgeable among our kindred in France, and an influential figure in our worldwide Consortium. She has offered to help us investigate the problem at hand and plan our strategy for self-defense, or—if necessary—a preemptive strike.  
  
  “Without further ado, I introduce to those of you who haven’t had the opportunity to make her acquaintance, Violette de Montauban and her companion, Arthur Poincaré. We are honored to have them join our house during the absence of Charlotte and Charles.”  
  
  From behind Jean-Baptiste stepped a couple I had never seen before. The girl’s snow-white complexion was set off by black hair that was pulled back from her face with a bunch of vivid purple flowers. She was tiny and fragile-looking, like a sparrow. And though she looked younger than me, I knew that for a revenant that didn’t mean a thing.  
  
  The boy moved in a distinctly old-fashioned style, stepping up to her side and holding his arm out for her to take it with the tips of her fingers. He was probably around twenty, and if his streaky blond hair hadn’t been tied back into a tight ponytail and his face so clean-shaven, he would have looked exactly like Kurt Cobain. With a major case of blue-blood.  
  
  They bowed formally to Jean-Baptiste and turned toward the room, solemnly nodding their acceptance of the enthusiastic welcome. The girl’s eyes paused on me and continued to Vincent, who was standing behind me with his hand resting on my hip. Her eyes narrowed slightly before moving on to scan the crowd, and then, seeing someone she knew, she stepped forward to chat. Jean-Baptiste followed her cue and began talking to a woman standing next to him.  
  
  The speech seemingly over, I searched for Charlotte to gauge her reaction to her replacements’ presentation. Their introduction during the twins’ party must have been a last-minute decision.  
  
  Charlotte stood at the back of the room with Ambrose, who  
had his arm draped securely around her shoulders. I guessed that the support he was giving was both physical and moral. Although she didn’t look surprised, it looked like her smile was costing her a lot of effort.  
  
  “I’m going to go talk to Charlotte,” I murmured to Vincent.  
  
  “Good idea,” he said, casting a worried glance at her. “I’ll make sure Charles is holding up.” He leaned over to kiss my temple and then, straightening, walked away.  
  
  I set off toward Charlotte. “Just wondering if you wanted to go outside for a breath of fresh air,” I said.  
  
  “I would love that,” she said, and reaching for my hand, she transferred herself from Ambrose’s custodianship to mine. Not for the first time, I wondered how she was going to hold out in the south of France—a whole nine-hour drive away from her support system. I didn’t doubt Charlotte’s strength. She had certainly been a solid shoulder for me to lean on. But now that she needed her friends the most, she was being forcibly separated from them.  
  
  We grabbed our coats on the way out and stepped into the bracing December air. The moon lit up the courtyard, illuminating its large marble fountain, which contained a life-size statue of an angel holding a woman in his arms. It was an image I never failed to compare to Vincent and me. In my eyes, the personal symbolism it held was as weighty as the stone it was carved from.  
  
  Charlotte and I sat down on the edge of its empty basin and huddled against each other for warmth. I looped my arm through hers and pulled her close. Getting close to Charlotte had helped me ignore the guilt of cutting off my friends back in New York. During the very worst period of my grieving for my parents, I had deleted my email address and hadn’t contacted them since.  
  
  “Did you know that your”—I hesitated, searching for a word less offensive than “replacements”—“that Violette and Arthur were coming today?”  
  
  Charlotte nodded. “Jean-Baptiste told me yesterday. He said he didn’t want me to feel like he was in a rush to replace us. But Violette offered to come, and he needs her. I can’t help but feel bad about it anyway. You know . . . unwanted. Like I’m being punished.”  
  
  “Even if it feels like a punishment, which Jean-Baptiste has assured everyone it isn’t, you’re not the one who’s being sent away. It’s Charles who messed up, no matter how unintentionally.” I squeezed her arm in support. “Jean-Baptiste’s rationale does make sense. If something big is going on with the numa, this would be a dangerous time for Charles to be here in the middle of it, indecisive and confused. Plus, he said you could stay if you wanted.”  
  
  “I can’t live without Charles,” she said mournfully. “He’s my twin. We’ve been through everything together.”  
  
  I nodded. I understood. We had a lot in common, Charlotte and I . . . if you didn’t take our mortality into account. Both of us had experienced the death of our parents. We were both left with only a sibling to link us to our former lives. I had my grandparents, of course, but my sister felt like the last remaining thread that connected me to reality. Although the meaning of the word “reality” had radically changed for me in the last few months.  
  
  “So do you know the new guys?” I asked.  
  
  “Yeah. I mean, I’ve never met them, but everyone’s heard of them. They’re part of the ‘old guard.’ If you think Jean-Baptiste’s old, they’re ancient. Although they’re just as aristocratic as him.”  
  
  “Yeah, that’s pretty obvious,” I laughed. “Violette looks like she died really young.”  
  
  Charlotte smiled. “Fourteen. Her father was a marquis or something, and she was a lady-in-waiting to Anne of Brittany. She died saving the young queen’s life during a kidnapping attempt.”  
  
  “Queen Anne? That makes her practically medieval!” I racked my brain for names and dates from my French history classes, but Charlotte beat me to the punch.  
  
  “She died right around 1500.”  
  
  “Holy cow. She’s more than a half a millennium old!”  
  
  Charlotte nodded thoughtfully.  
  
  “How about Arthur?”  
  
  “He’s from the same era. They actually knew each other in life. He was one of her father’s counselors, I think. In any case, they both reek of courtliness. She and Arthur live in a medieval castle in the Loire Valley, where I’m sure they feel right at home.” There was a bitter tone in Charlotte’s voice. It sounded like she wished they would go back to their château and leave us all alone.  
  
  “Their coming here is like a dream come true for JB. They’ve been around so long they’re like living encyclopedias. Kind of like Gaspard times ten. And Violette’s known all over the world for being the expert on revenant history. She knows more about the numa than anyone. Which makes her the perfect candidate for helping JB strategize.” She shrugged as if that conclusion were obvious.  
  
  The creaking sound of the front door opening interrupted us. We turned our heads to see the topic of our conversation, her nobility so tangible it was like a cloud of expensive perfume suspended in the cold winter air.  
  
  “Hello,” Violette said. Her voice mixed the high pitch of a little girl’s with an older woman’s self-assurance. This creepy discrepancy quickly disappeared as her rosebud lips curved up into a friendly smile that was so infectious, I couldn’t help but smile back.  
  
  Bending over, she gave us the regulation kiss on the cheeks, and then stood. “I would like to present myself. Violette de Montauban.”  
  
  “Yeah, we know,” said Charlotte, studying her shoes as if the silver strappy heels held the answer to the universe, and might just reveal it if she stared hard enough.  
  
  “You must be Charlotte,” Violette said, acting as if she hadn’t noticed the brush-off, “and you”—she turned to me—“you must be Vincent’s human.”  
  
  The sound that burst from my mouth was a half sputter, half laugh. “Um, I actually have a name. I’m Kate.”  
  
  “Of course, how silly of me. Kate.” She turned her attention back to Charlotte, who still refused to meet her gaze. “I’m sorry if our sudden arrival has caused you distress,” Violette said, accurately reading Charlotte’s body language. “I was afraid it might come across as unduly insensitive myself, but once I offered our services, Jean-Baptiste insisted that Arthur and I come with the greatest of haste.”  
  
  “‘Greatest of haste’? You don’t get out much, do you?” said Charlotte rudely.  
  
  “Charlotte!” I reproached, nudging her with my elbow.  
  
  “That’s okay,” Violette laughed. “No, Arthur and I keep to ourselves. I spend most of my time with my nose in old books. And as guardians-in-residence of the Château de Langeais, we don’t, as you say, ‘get out very much.’ I’m afraid that is apparent in my mode of speech.”  
  
  “If you’re never around humans, how do you integrate enough to save them?” Charlotte said, visibly trying to temper her bitterness.  
  
  “As I’m sure you’re aware, the longer we are revenants, the less compulsion we have to die. I was nearing sixty when I spoke with Jean-Baptiste a couple of weeks ago. Since then, I managed to save a few gypsy children playing on the train tracks, and Arthur rescued a hunter from an attack by a pack of wild boar. So we’re refreshed and ready for the job ahead of us. But that’s the most animation”—she paused to smile at her pun—“we’ve seen for decades.”  
  
  I shivered, not from the cold but from the thought that this young girl had recently looked the age of her own grandmother—that is, if her grandmother weren’t already lying around mummified somewhere. And now here she was, younger than me. Although I should be used to it, the whole revenant concept of reanimating at the age you first died was still hard for me to wrap my head around.  
  
  Violette studied Charlotte’s face for another second, and then touched her arm with an elegant finger. “I don’t have to stay in your room if you don’t wish me to. Jean-Baptiste offered me the guest room if I preferred. Your taste in decorating is, of course, much more appealing to me than his penchant for dark leather upholstery and antler chandeliers.”  
  
  Charlotte couldn’t keep herself from laughing.  
Reaching out toward Violette, she took her hand and stood to face the ancient adolescent. “I’m sorry. This is just a really hard time for me and Charles. I consider these kindred my family, and the fact that we have to leave them during a crisis is literally killing me.”  
  
  I stifled a smile. Charlotte noticed and grinned. “Okay, not literally. You know what I mean.”  
  
  Violette leaned toward Charlotte and, opening her arms, gracefully wrapped them around her. “Everything will be okay. Arthur and I will look after your kindred for you, and the present difficulties will be over before you know it.”  
  
  Charlotte returned her hug, a bit stiffly since the younger girl was standing as if she was wearing a corset. But it seemed like peace had been made between the two. I couldn’t help but wonder if Charles was faring as well.

  ONE OF THE BALLROOM WINDOWS SWUNG OPEN, and Vincent leaned out looking like an old-fashioned movie star in his vintage tuxedo. “Ladies, it’s almost midnight. And I, for one, hoped not to have to resort to kissing Gaspard when the clock strikes twelve.” He grinned and looked over his shoulder at the older man, who rolled his eyes and shook his head in despair.  
  
  Violette, Charlotte, and I made our way back to the room just as the guests began the New Year’s countdown. The air practically crackled with excitement. Considering how many times some of these people had celebrated New Year’s Eve, I found it intriguing that they hadn’t tired of it long ago. Humans saw it as the beginning of a fresh new year: one of only several dozen that fate would allot them.

1mswf0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mswf0g/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_mr_coffee_sk13rb/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Mr Coffee SK13RB Worth It,"Testing out the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB has been an enlightening experience. As someone who begins their day with a strong cup of coffee and often relies on it to power through mid-afternoon slumps, I put this coffee maker through its paces. From its sleek design to its practical functionalities, it has proven to be a reliable companion. Still, it’s not without some quirks that might not sit well with everyone.

**Design that Blends with Every Kitchen**  
The aesthetic of this coffee maker is understated but classy. Its compact size (11.76"" x 12.3"" x 13.8"") ensures it doesn’t occupy unnecessary space on the countertop, which is a blessing in smaller kitchens. The black finish is timeless, and it complements most modern and traditional kitchen setups. It’s lightweight, too, at just 3.6 pounds, making it easy to move around. I appreciated the cord storage feature, which kept my countertop free of tangled cords. While the design didn’t particularly scream luxury, it made up for it with old-school practicality.

**User-Friendly Controls and Setup**  
I’m not a fan of overly complicated gadgets in the morning when my mind is still groggy. Thankfully, this coffee maker uses intuitive button controls and a straightforward operation mode. The indicator light was a small detail but incredibly handy—it’s reassuring to know at a glance whether the machine is on or off. The included manual was clear and made it a breeze to figure out. In about 10 minutes, I had it set up, filled with water, and ready to brew my first batch.

[Find the best price for Mr. Coffee SK13-RB on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b002yi2ig0/)

**Performance and Brewing Experience**  
The performance of this coffee maker was smooth and relatively quick. Whether it was brewing a full 12-cup pot or just a single serving, it delivered coffee that was consistently hot and flavorful. The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature became one of my favorite things almost immediately. If you’re impatient like me and can’t wait for the entire pot to brew, this feature lets you pour a cup midway without creating a dripping mess. The coffee tasting experience was impressive for a drip coffee machine in this category.

**Convenience in Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Cleaning appliances is probably my least favorite household chore, so I was particularly attentive to how easy this coffee maker was to maintain. The reusable filter basket is removable, which means cleaning it out was quick and fuss-free. I’d recommend rinsing it immediately after brewing to minimize residue buildup. The glass carafe, though elegant, does need careful handling to avoid accidental chips or cracks during washing or storage.

**Strong Points**  
- The Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause feature is a lifesaver for those in a rush.  
- Easy-to-use operation with clear on/off indicators.  
- Compact design with convenient cord storage for tidier counters.  
- Reusable filter basket saves the hassle and expense of paper filters.  

**Weaknesses**  
- The glass carafe feels a little on the fragile side and might require careful handling.  
- Limited to basic functionality—no advanced settings or programmable features.  

**Competing Products**  
Compared to similarly priced drip coffee machines, the Mr. Coffee SK13-RB holds its ground pretty well. For instance, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 offers advanced programming features but comes at a notably higher price point and takes up a bit more space. The Keurig K-Classic, on the other hand, excels at single-serve brewing and faster brew times but requires proprietary pods, making it less eco-friendly and potentially more expensive over time. This Mr. Coffee model clearly targets those looking for simplicity, affordability, and reliability, making it an excellent choice for anyone who doesn’t need the latest tech bells and whistles in their coffee brewer.

**Affordable Quality**  
For the features and quality delivered, this coffee maker hits a sweet spot in value. It isn’t the cheapest option available, but you aren't paying for unnecessary frills either. Given its sturdy performance and durable build, it feels like it’s worth every penny. Whether you’re a casual coffee drinker or a heavy user like me, it offers a lot of functionality for its cost. Plus, reusable features like the basket filter ensure there are minimal recurring expenses after your initial purchase.

My husband (37M) and I (39F) have been together for almost 15 years. We both hold advanced degrees and we both make a great wage. I don't want to state an actual number for fear of being targeted in some way, but suffice it to say that we are not struggling by any metric and we live far below our means.

And yet, my husband continues to be the tightest mother@#$&er I've ever met in my life. When our dryer went out, he spent six weeks trying to fix it with intermittent results (he's an engineer and he's very handy, but he's also extremely particular). When I finally had enough of line drying clothes, I put my foot down and sent him out into the world with a blank check and the instructions of ""I don't care how much it costs, find a dryer you like and bring it home tonight."" 

He came home with a $100 one from the second-hand shop that had been left out in the rain. The drum was full of rust and mold and it screeched so loud that I couldn't dry clothes at night when the kids were sleeping. He swore he could fix it. He couldn't. We ended up replacing it again, this time he bought the cheapest entry-level Maytag dryer at Costco. But it works, so whatever. 

It's like this with everything. He'll turn lights off when I'm still in the room. If I make a pot of coffee, he'll walk by and flip the burner off so my second pour is ice cold. He unplugs every device with a clock on it to prevent power drain from the LEDs. If the kids ask for something as little as $6, he'll complain about the cost. The thermostat is set to 80 degrees when we're out of the house and it takes hours to cool off when we get home. 

I foster rescue puppies and I housebreak them to a litter box. I'm sick and feverish currently, so he offered to stop at the store to buy grass pellets for the box yesterday, which was super kind of him. I sent him a picture of what I needed. He bought something other than what I asked him to because it was $2 cheaper. Spoiler alert: these won't work. I swallowed my irritation and thanked him for doing it anyway, then ran a bath so I could finally feel warm and use the steam to decongest my sinuses. 

He'd turned the water heater down to the point that it was a hair above leukwarm coming out of the tap. 

I'm not proud of it, but I *lost it.* I rarely yell but I let him have it about how frustrated I am by the pinching of every thin, red cent to the point of misery. I didn't spend nearly a decade in university to live like this. I want hot water and a cool house, I want to treat our daughters to goodies and I don't want to feel guilty when I do it! I want to know what time it is without looking at my phone!

1mswcou,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1mswcou/what_are_we_supposed_to_do_about_everything_going/,What are we supposed to do about everything going on,"I know this sentiment is widespread, but after watching Atrioc talk about Trump, the coming environmental crisis, and finance bros getting away with blatantly illegal acts, it’s hard not to feel hopeless.
I'm glad people like him and other creators like CofeeZilla are bringing this to light but I'm also wondering what's the point of discussing and showing these things if we can't act upon it.
I feel people are either lied to about what's going on, choose to avoid looking at the problems or at best see the problems but can't do anything.

I can't complain about my situation, I'm an EU french frog who is in field where I should hopefully find a job without too many problem (masters degree + 2 year internship in management accounting). I don't have financial issues, have friends and am healthy.
But even with all that it feels difficult to make a difference with these large issues. I'm going to join an association and try to contribute as much as I can but the issues (environmental, economical, social and political) are so big they seem impossible to act on our scale.
I know there is no easy answer but it's hard not to feel a bit lost.

PS : This doesn't mean I don't want ""so much sad news"" from Atrioc. He's reporting on what is happening in the world and I've always enjoyed his content. Except the hollow knight tier list.

1mswba6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mswba6/explore_if_the_best_electric_kettle_cuisinart_gk/,Explore if the Best Electric Kettle Cuisinart GK 1 Is Worth It,"Cuisinart GK-1 Digital, the stainless steel kettle with its sleek design, became my daily companion. I’m someone who thrives on coffee, tea, and an occasional cup of instant noodles late at night, so testing this piece of kitchen tech felt like a natural progression in my life. Not just functional, the kettle also has a sense of sophistication with its matte black finish — it looks great sitting on the counter, and I found myself casually admiring it every time I walked by to grab a cup of tea. Yes, I admit it, I stared a little too long.

**Design That Steals the Show**  
The moment this digital gooseneck kettle arrived, I couldn’t stop appreciating its aesthetics. The stainless-steel body with the matte black finish doesn’t just scream durability but also matches modern kitchen vibes flawlessly. What caught my attention next was the precision gooseneck spout. While the design might be common for gooseneck kettles, this one stood out for its precise flow control. Pouring water with this kettle feels like an art form; I didn’t drip a single drop no matter how quickly or slowly I poured. The comfortable, ergonomic handle is another brownie point, offering a solid grip even during late-night coffee cravings when grogginess is at its peak.

[Ready to snag Cuisinart GK-1? See Amazon’s price.](https://cncgn.com/p/b08kct8t6c/)

**Efficient Performance That Impresses**  
I used to detest waiting for water to boil; with the 1200-watt power of this electric kettle, impatience is no longer my issue. Water heats up so fast that my tea routine has practically halved in time. This fast heating feature became highly useful on busy mornings when every second feels stolen from the endless to-do list. The one-touch control system makes operating this kettle hassle-free — it’s all about simplicity. Moreover, the 30-minute keep-warm option provided a surprising level of convenience. I could step away for errands or chores and still have my water at the perfect temperature when I returned.

**Favorable Attributes**  
- The precision gooseneck spout delivers flawless pour control.
- Quick heat-up functionality powered by 1200 watts is a time-saver.
- The stainless-steel construction ensures durability and aesthetics.
- Ergonomic handle design offers good grip and safety.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The 1-liter capacity might feel restrictive for those requiring larger quantities at once.  
- Lack of added temperature settings may disappoint advanced coffee enthusiasts.  
- It tends to retain exterior heat after boiling, so I had to be cautious while touching it.

**Using it Made Life Easier**  
Making a perfect cup of coffee felt easier with this gooseneck kettle. The nonslip handle and well-balanced weight distribution also equate to fewer wrist strains, something my clumsiest family member even mentioned. I’ll admit, I kept testing different ways to handle this kettle for pouring, just marveling at how steady and consistent it was. Morning coffee or even precise pour-over methods didn’t feel like a chore anymore.

**Peer Products in Comparison**  
Other options like the Fellow Stagg EKG have garnered a lot of attention in this price range. While the Fellow kettle beats this one with its temperature settings, the Cuisinart GK-1 surpasses expectations on speed, ease of use, and affordability aspects. I’ve also compared it to budget gooseneck kettles like Bonavita’s, and this model feels sturdier, albeit slightly less feature-packed.

**Quality for Price**  
In terms of affordability, this digital kettle delivers more than its price tag suggests. It feels like the perfect balance between practicality and design. Comparing it to higher-priced premium models, the Cuisinart GK-1 stands its ground by offering fewer bells and whistles but bringing seamless performance. Similarly, against lower-priced models, the superior build and faster heating capabilities justify spending more.

1mswb86,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArrowVDisscussions/comments/1mswb86/review_27_the_flash_season_4/,Review 27: The Flash Season 4,"The Flash Season 4 premiered on October 10th, 2017 on The CW. The main cast from the previous seasons mostly return this season. Joining them is Niel Sandilands as Clifford DeVoe and Hartley Sawyer as Ralph Dibney. The season follows Barry, having returned from his self-imposed stay in the Speed Force, as he faces down Clifford DeVoe / Thinker. In the aftermath of Savitar’s defeat, Barry enters the speedforce prison to atone for creating Flashpoint. Barry entrusts the safety of National City to his team. Over the course of this season, we get a Flying Samurai Android, Clifford DeVoe/Thinker, Earth-X Nazis led by Evil versions of Oliver Queen and Kara Zor-El, and even Eobard Thawne in the appearance of Harrison Wells, more on all of that later.

In the season premiere, “The Flash Reborn”, Iris has been aiding Team Flash in Central City for six months, but refuses to grieve Barry. A flying samurai with superpowers appears in Central City, threatening to destroy the city if the real Flash does not face him. Cisco reveals he has formulated a way to bring back Barry without destabilizing the Speed Force and tracks down Caitlin for help, but is forbidden by Iris to bring Barry back. Against Iris' orders, Team Flash successfully returns Barry, who rambles random statements and continually writes symbols on the walls. Wally engages the samurai, but is defeated. Cisco deciphers Barry's writings and finds an apparently meaningless sentence. In an attempt to recover Barry's memories, Iris gives herself up to the samurai. The plan works and Barry speeds away, rescuing Iris and defeating the samurai, who is revealed to be an android. Caitlin rejoins Team Flash, but is revealed to have been working for mobster Amunet Black (played by BSG and Longmire’s Katee Sackhoff), while also continuing to prevent the Killer Frost personality from emerging. The ""Samuroid"" is revealed to have been controlled by a supremely intelligent man in a superpowered wheelchair, whose plan was to draw out the Flash for his next schemes.

In “Mixed Signals,” When Barry, Joe, and Cisco report to a crime scene, they discover remnants of a mysterious code. Cisco presents Barry with a technologically advanced suit, intended to facilitate his activities. He tests it out, trying to save someone from a haywire car controlled by metahuman Ramsey Deacon. Gypsy arrives on Earth-1 for a date with Cisco, who is forced to cancel it so as to focus on Deacon. Acting on a suggestion from Caitlin, Iris signs her and Barry up for couples therapy to sort out their relationship. Deacon kidnaps a witness, a former member of a tech team that stole his idea for profit. Barry and Wally go to save him, but Deacon uses his abilities to send Barry's suit haywire. On Iris' instruction, Barry throws lightning at himself, shorting out his suit. He then incapacitates Deacon, who is locked up in the meta wing of Iron Heights, revealed to be part of the intelligent man's plan. Cisco finally goes out with Gypsy. Wondering how Deacon gained his powers being absent during the particle accelerator explosion, Barry and Joe learn from Deacon that there are ""others.""

“Luck be A Lady”, In flashbacks, the intelligent man observes Becky Sharpe, a woman with unending bad luck, and determines that she will be easily manipulated. In the present, Becky robs a bank and gets away when Barry slips on marbles. Harry arrives from Earth-2 and tells Wally that Jesse has decided to break up with him to focus on her vigilantism. Cisco deduces that Becky is a metahuman with the power of favorable luck while inducing misfortune to others. Barry realizes that the portal he used to escape the Speed Force exposed an entire busload of people, including Becky and Deacon, to transformative dark matter. Harry informs Cisco that Jesse has expelled him from her crime-fighting team due to his attitude. Becky's powers expand out of control, reactivating the particle accelerator, which Harry deliberately allows, nullifying Becky's powers and leading to her incarceration. Cisco and Harry identify twelve new metahumans created on the bus and the latter suspects that an unknown party has manipulated the events surrounding Barry's return. Wally decides to leave on a journey to find himself. The intelligent man is revealed to be spying on S.T.A.R. Labs through the ""Samuroid"" helmet. Joe learns Cecile is pregnant.

In “Elongated Journey in Night”, Gypsy's father, Breacher, attacks Cisco, vowing to hunt and kill him in 24 hours, but allowing the romance should he survive. Team Flash learns that the bus driver was murdered and tracks down another passenger, Ralph Dibny, a former corrupt CCPD detective who Barry exposed that is now a private investigator. As two thugs attack Dibny, he is revealed to have the power to stretch. Caitlin stabilizes his powers with a serum. The team learns that Ralph has been blackmailing Mayor Anthony Bellows over his adultery, so the latter hired the thugs. Barry confronts Ralph for his actions, but Ralph maintains he was a ""good cop."" He later stops blackmailing Bellows, who still attempts to kill him while Breacher mistakes the former for a Plastoid, the species that invaded Earth-19 previously, and attacks him. Cisco intervenes and saves Ralph, whom Barry, having revealed his alter-ego, convinces to help arrest an escaping Bellows. Admiring Cisco's gallantry, Breacher allows the relationship. Barry recruits Ralph for Team Flash and learns that someone named DeVoe instructed Ralph to watch Bellows. Barry remembers that Abra Kadabra and Savitar both mentioned a DeVoe. Meanwhile, Caitlin finds a message on her apartment door.

In “Girls Night Out”, Felicity joins Iris' bachelorette party. Mocking Cisco's plans for Barry's bachelor party, Ralph takes the men to a strip club, where they find Cecile's daughter, Joanie, working. Joe confronts her, but she states that she is only doing feminist research. Ralph incites a brawl, leading to the men's arrest until Harry posts bail. Meanwhile, Amunet's enforcer, Norvok, demands Caitlin's return and attacks the women when she refuses. Killer Frost emerges and repels him, later telling Iris that Caitlin accepted Amunet's employment in exchange for the means to control Frost. Learning that Amunet is holding a metahuman she calls the ""Weeper"", whose tears are a strong narcotic, prisoner and intends to sell him, Iris' party decides to stop her. Though Caitlin refuses to join, she attacks Amunet when seeing her friends in danger. Using a strong magnet, the team robs Amunet of her metal shards, leaving her powerless. Iris dissuades Frost from killing Amunet, who promises revenge. Both parties refuse to tell each other about their adventures. Iris asks Caitlin to be her maid of honor while Joe convinces Joanie to tell Cecile about her research. The intelligent man captures the Weeper.

In “When Harry met Harry….” Barry trains Ralph to use his abilities, with Cisco making a stretchable suit for him. Another bus metahuman, a Lakota Sioux Native named Mina Chaytan who can animate statues, starts attacking Central City and stealing pieces of a Black Bison necklace, which she claims belongs to her tribe. When Barry and Ralph catch up to her, she attacks Barry with a caveman statue and attempts a getaway. Ralph chooses to stop her, but a little girl is injured in the process. Ralph regrets his actions, but is comforted by Barry. Chayton escapes CCPD, going after the last necklace piece held at the museum. When Barry and Ralph confront her, she brings a dinosaur skeleton to life. Barry arrests Chayton while Ralph saves a security guard from the skeleton. Later, Ralph reveals he mailed the necklace back to Chayton's tribe before visiting the little girl in the hospital, using his abilities to entertain her. Meanwhile, Harry, trying to make friends, works with his doppelgangers from alternate Earths, dubbed The Council of Wells. They deduce that DeVoe is a man named Clifford DeVoe. Barry and Joe head to DeVoe's house, but find a middle-aged man in a wheelchair.

In “Therefore I Am”, Barry and Joe interrogate DeVoe and his wife Marlize to try and get more information. In flashbacks, DeVoe and Marlize build a thinking cap to improve his brain capacity, powering it through the particle accelerator explosion. DeVoe's increased brain power accelerates his amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, forcing his wife to build him a special chair to keep him alive. Barry discovers the camera in the Samuroid head and goes to DeVoe's house, narrowly avoiding being caught by DeVoe's wife. Barry later confronts DeVoe, who reveals his true identity, leading to Cisco dubbing him ""The Thinker."" Wally returns to Team Flash from Blue Valley.

Now we’re on to part three of “Crisis On Earth-X”, Barry, Oliver, Sara, Alex, Martin and Jax wake up in a Nazi concentration camp on Earth-X wearing power dampeners. The arriving SS Sturmbannführer is revealed to be the Earth-X doppelgänger of Quentin Lance, who plans to execute them, but they are saved by Leo Snart (the Earth-X doppelgänger of Leonard Snart) and Ray Terrill. Snart and Terrill take them to the headquarters of the Freedom Fighters, where the team meets the resistance movement's leader, General Schott (Winn Schott's Earth-X doppelgänger). They learn that the only way back to Earth-1 is through a temporal gateway in a research facility, which Schott plans to blow up to strand Dark Arrow (Oliver's Earth-X doppelgänger) on Earth-1. Oliver disguises himself as Dark Arrow to infiltrate the facility and discovers the Nazis have a contingency plan, a militarized timeship called Wellenreiter. Barry and Ray battle the Freedom Fighters' Red Tornado to stop it from destroying the gateway while the rest of the team enter the facility to reactivate its portal. During the battle, Stein is shot and gravely wounded. On Earth-1, Eobard Thawne prepares to perform surgery on Kara to save Overgirl. Felicity and Iris try to stop him, but are captured.

In “Don’t Run”, While out Christmas shopping, Barry is ambushed and kidnapped by DeVoe while Caitlin is kidnapped from Jitters by Amunet. Iris claims they have to look for both of them, despite Harry's claim that they have insufficient time and resources and that they can only afford to search for one. Caitlin is forced by Amunet to perform surgery on a metahuman named Dominic Lanse who can read minds. They try to escape, but Amunet blocks their exit. Caitlin manages to briefly incapacitate Amunet, so she and Dominic can flee the building in which they are being held. Once outside, they are rescued by Cisco and Ralph, as Iris chose to focus on finding Caitlin. Barry manages to escape from DeVoe. Team Flash celebrates Christmas at the West house and Dominic joins them. Barry gets a security alert from his apartment. When he arrives, he receives a phone call from Dominic, who reveals that Amunet re-kidnapped Dominic and DeVoe transferred his consciousness into Dominic's body. Barry discovers DeVoe's original body dead on his apartment floor and realizes DeVoe has framed him for his ""murder;"" the police arrive and Barry lets himself get arrested, not wanting to leave Iris again.

In “The Trial of The Flash”, Barry stands trial for the murder of Clifford DeVoe with Cecile representing him. Cisco and Joe have to leave during the trial for a meta investigation in which a meta caused people to collapse. Singh reveals to Joe that he is appearing as a witness for the prosecution against Barry. The meta is eventually discovered to be Neil Borman, a meta whose production of radiation is unintentionally causing the illnesses and collapsing. Barry takes him on, but is ill-equipped to deal with the situation. Cisco and Killer Frost travel to the scene so Caitlin can freeze Borman, but he quickly defrosts and incapacitates Caitlin. Barry creates a vacuum seal around Borman to contain the radiation and Cisco transports it to the dead Earth-15, draining the meta and defeating him. Barry is eventually found guilty by the jury and is sentenced to life in prison. Warden Gregory Wolfe locks him in Henry's old cell.

In “The Elongated Knight Rises”, Barry uses his speed to secretly help the guards contain the other inmates during a prison riot. He also befriends Dave Ratchet, his father's former cellmate. The next day, Barry meets Axel Walker, who later gets broken out of prison by his mother Zoey Clark, his father's one-time partner Prank. Axel challenges Ralph by threatening to cause chaos in the city. Ralph attempts to stop him, but is wounded by Axel and evacuated by Cisco. Ralph sneaks into the prison to talk to Barry about being scared. Barry reassures him that being a hero is not about not being scared, but about having the ability to rise above your fear. Cisco and Caitlin go to rescue the hostages, but get captured by Axel and Zoey. Ralph arrives and shields the two from an acid shower until Wells manages to hack into the shower system to neutralize its acidity. Iris visits Barry in prison, where they reaffirm their love for each other. Ralph and Cisco go get coffee and meet the excitable girl from the wedding. The girl writes in her journal with what appears to be the language Barry was using when he came out of the Speed Force.

In “Honey I Shrunk Team Flash”, Cecile develops telepathic abilities due to her pregnancy combined with the dormant dark matter in her cells, but Caitlin assures her the effects should be temporary. In prison, Barry learns that Ratchet is innocent of a robbery-homicide that was actually committed by Sylbert Rundine fifteen years prior and asks the team to look into the case. Rundine turns out to be a bus meta with the ability to shrink and enlarge objects and he shrinks Cisco and Ralph while escaping. Harry's attempted cure backfires and Caitlin determines that, if they are not re-enlarged within a certain period of time, their bodies will explode. The team confronts Rundine at a warehouse where Harry tricks him into re-enlarging Ralph and Cisco. Rundine is arrested, but refuses to confess to the earlier crime. Ratchet states he has nothing waiting for him outside, but reveals his dream of living in a secluded Chinese village called Jiaju. Barry then uses his speed to take Ratchet to Jiaju to live out his dream. After capturing Barry on cameras and discovering he is the Flash, Warden Wolfe locks him in his private metahuman wing intending to sell him to Amunet.

In “True Colors”, Wolfe plans to sell Barry, Ramsey Deacon, Becky Sharpe, Mina Chaytan, and Sylbert Rundine to Amunet, so they plan to escape. Cecile discovers Wolfe's plans after reading his mind. Ralph encounters a former colleague and his negative interaction with him prompts the discovery that he can shapeshift. His lack of mastery of the new ability prevents his attempt to foil Amunet's deal with Wolfe. Barry helps the metas escape the power dampeners, but they are cornered by Wolfe and Amunet. DeVoe arrives and again uses his chair to extract the metas' abilities before transferring his mind into Sharpe's body. He then kills Wolfe as Marlize looks on in horror while Amunet flees. Ralph uses his shapeshifting ability to appear as the original DeVoe at Barry's appeal, clearing his name. Team Flash realizes that DeVoe is only stealing powers from metahumans who were on the bus when the dark matter wave was unleashed, which means he will likely target Ralph as well. Back at the DeVoes' house, their marriage continues to deteriorate and DeVoe drugs his wife with the Weeper's tears to maintain her devotion towards him.

In “Subject 9”, Barry is put on indefinite leave at the CCPD due to his connection with the DeVoe case. The team encounters another bus metahuman named Izzy Bowin with sound wave abilities that she can amplify with her violin. She manages to use her abilities when DeVoe (inside Sharpe's body) comes to claim her. Barry and Ralph help train Izzy to refine her abilities, which proves difficult when she gets hurt. Eventually, DeVoe shows up once again, using Dominic's and Becky's abilities to make Barry experience a brain aneurysm while using Rundine's abilities to incapacitate Ralph. DeVoe again uses his chair to transfer his mind into Izzy's body and escapes. Both Ralph and Barry comfort each other over their respective losses: Barry being let go from the police force and Ralph losing Izzy to DeVoe. These losses enforce both Barry's and Ralph's senses of determination to bring DeVoe down and save the three remaining metas.

“Enter Flashtime”, Jesse comes to Earth-1 to have a talk with her dad. Eco-terrorist Veronica Dale sets off a nuclear bomb, which Barry tries to stop by entering a form of superspeed known as Flashtime where everything is frozen. However, the bomb has already detonated and he and Jesse cannot stop it or save everyone with superspeed. Jay Garrick comes from Earth-3 to help, but they are still unable to stop it. Barry remains in Flashtime for hours, bringing each of his friends into it in an attempt to find a solution; they discuss options such as freezing it or sending it to another Earth, but none of those solutions prove to be viable. Eventually, Iris gives him the idea to retrieve the Quark Sphere from the Speed Force to send a blast of lightning through the bomb to disable it. Barry does so and throws the Sphere back into the Speed Force, saving Central City. Jay reveals he is training a new female speedster to take his place. Jesse and Jay return to their Earths and Caitlin and Wells go for coffee, where they encounter the mysterious girl.

In “Run Iris, Run”, Eric Frye, a metahuman with fire powers, tries to rob Central City Bank. Another bus meta named Matthew Kim touches Frye, which causes his powers to transfer to Jaco Birch. When Joe, Iris, and Barry turn up to ask Kim a few questions, Barry and Iris come into contact with Kim, causing Barry to lose his speed and Iris to gain superspeed. Inspired by Thawne, Harry plans to build his own thinking cap to outwit DeVoe. With their roles reversed, Iris becomes Central City's hero speedster, while Barry must learn to act as team leader. Birch demands money and terrorizes the city with his fire powers. Using Wells' thinking cap, the Team comes up with the idea for Iris to create a tidal wave, negating the flames and defeating Birch. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Kim touches Iris and Barry again, restoring the Flash's speed. At home, Iris admits that, while she did enjoy having superspeed, Central City needs Barry's light and she is happy being team leader. Wells uses his thinking cap once more, determining the final two bus metas are Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss.

In “Null and Annoyed”, Barry and Ralph train to defeat DeVoe, with Barry becoming annoyed at Ralph's apparent inability to be serious. The team manages to locate Janet Petty. When Barry and Ralph confront her, it is revealed that Petty can manipulate a person's gravitational pull, which she demonstrates on Barry. Fearing once again that Ralph is not taking things seriously, Barry refuses to work with him. Ralph reveals his comedic attitude is due to a difficult childhood where his father abandoned him, causing him to make jokes whenever he is scared or under pressure. Barry relents and they go to stop Janet at a gala event. Janet uses her powers on Barry, causing him to float into the atmosphere. Barry tells the team to trust Ralph to improvise. Ralph detains Janet, then becomes a giant airbag to allow Barry to land safely. DeVoe's wife discovers he has been drugging her, but he wipes her memory of this, which is revealed to have happened multiple times to keep her assisting him. Breacher comes to Earth-1 to ask Cisco for help as some of his powers have failed. Harry takes the thinking cap to Thawne's time vault to recharge it and activates Gideon.

In “Lose Yourself”, Team Flash tracks down the final bus meta Edwin Gauss, but is followed by the Samuroid, who injures Caitlin. The team rushes back to S.T.A.R. Labs to regroup and heal. Caitlin reveals to Iris that Killer Frost is activated by her adrenal gland and she is working on a way to separate them. Harry introduces a tuning fork weapon that mimics Izzy's abilities and can defeat DeVoe. Ralph reveals to Barry that he is not afraid of losing his own life, but of Team Flash losing theirs, as he considers them family. The DeVoes attack S.T.A.R. Labs, during which Harry overcharges his Thinking Cap and collapses. DeVoe eventually manages to take over the abilities of Gauss, Janet Petty, and Matthew Kim, before transferring his mind into Ralph's body. The team tries to stop him, but DeVoe incapacitates them and alters Caitlin's DNA, removing the dark matter and Killer Frost, before leaving. Back at his lair, DeVoe uses Ralph's morphing abilities to assume his original likeness while he and Marlize plan their next move to destroy Team Flash.

In “Fury Rogue”, With DeVoe moving forward with his plans, Team Flash decides to secure Neil Borman. Barry and Cisco travel to Earth-X to recruit Leo Snart as backup, but are followed to Earth-1 by Siren-X, the Earth-X doppelganger of Laurel Lance. Team Flash plans to deliver Borman to a safe A.R.G.U.S. facility, using a suit to contain the radiation in case Borman goes nuclear. Snart agrees to help, but claims he can only stay for 24 hours, as he is due to marry Ray Terrill. DeVoe attempts to intercept the transfer, but he and Team Flash are further ambushed by Earth-X Laurel, who kidnaps Caitlin, Borman, and Joe, holding them at CCPD. Snart learns about Ralph and convinces Barry to allow himself to grieve his fallen allies, which Barry eventually does, giving him the strength to defeat Laurel. Lyla transfers Borman to another facility and Leo returns to Earth-X. Cisco and Harry come up with a plan to boost Harry's thinking cap. DeVoe goes more into his ""god-complex,"" stating that human emotion is a weakness and causing Marlize to doubt him.

In “Therefore She Is”, DeVoe starts gathering the technology required to build the Enlightenment Machine, murdering anyone who gets in his way. Barry, Cisco, Iris, and Harry attempt to trigger Killer Frost's powers in Caitlin, but do not succeed. Harry reveals to the team that the amount of dark matter he used with the Thinking Cap caused brain damage. Cisco, Gypsy, Barry, and Caitlin fight Marlize and DeVoe when they move to acquire the computers required to power the Enlightenment Machine. Flashbacks reveal partially why Marlize follows DeVoe: she was a humanitarian worker in Kenya who created a water purifier for a villager but, when warlords found out about it, they attacked and killed everyone. Marlize pleads with DeVoe when he begins choking Gypsy; she later decides to leave him, encasing his chair in a force-field so that DeVoe cannot stop her from leaving the pocket dimension. The team realizes that DeVoe plans to use the Enlightenment Machine to launch dark matter towards Earth, reverting all of humanity into a simplified state, similar to what Harry has become. The mysterious girl brings a gift to Cecile and Joe's baby shower and, after leaving quickly, runs away using speedster abilities.

In “Harry and The Harrisons”, After Harry is expelled from the Council of Wells due to his declining intelligence, Cisco assembles a Council of Harrisons to try and come up with a way of stopping Harry's intelligence loss. Team Flash reluctantly go to Amunet for help, encountering Norvok in the process, though Barry insists Amunet must not kill. The team is eventually given a bomb made from Amunet's metal which will be capable of destroying one of DeVoe's satellites and Harry manages to work out that DeVoe's plan might be changing because Marlize is no longer with him. Iris posts an article revealing DeVoe's plan and the residents of Central City begin reporting DeVoe sightings, which Iris believes will hamper his ability to remain undetected.

In “Think Fast”, DeVoe infiltrates the A.R.G.U.S. facility holding Fallout by impersonating John Diggle and kills most of the security, except for some hostages; he then overcharges and kills Fallout to act as a nuclear battery for the satellites. Barry runs to Star City and brings back John so he can reveal the location of the facility. Caitlin and Cisco ask Barry to train them in Flashtime so that they can save the hostages and Barry can follow DeVoe through the breach before it closes. In the last stages of pregnancy, Cecile's telepathy causes her to take on the personality and thoughts of anyone nearby. Harry and Iris track Marlize to Oxford and use the last extrapolator to get there. Caitlin and Cisco rescue the hostages. Searching her mind for Killer Frost, Caitlin has Cisco vibe her into a repressed memory of a childhood accident; Killer Frost was already part of Caitlin decades before the particle accelerator created any metahumans. Barry follows DeVoe through the breach and destroys a satellite with Amunet's bomb. DeVoe takes control of S.T.A.R. Labs and uses its satellite to replace the destroyed one. He initiates the Enlightenment protocol in the time vault.

In the season finale, “We Are the Flash”, After the Enlightenment begins, Marlize uses Cecile's powers to send Barry into DeVoe's consciousness and find the good left in him. Barry finds Ralph alive and together they find the ""good"" DeVoe dead. DeVoe attempts to keep them from reaching the nexus of his mind, following Team Flash to a pocket dimension. In his consciousness, DeVoe multiplies himself to fight Barry and Ralph, taking down Team Flash. Barry and Ralph reach the nexus; Barry wakes up in the real world and Ralph reclaims his body just as DeVoe is about to kill Cecile. DeVoe reappears as a hologram through his chair until Marlize destroys it, killing him. A dead man's switch triggers the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to fall towards Central City. Barry, Cisco, and Ralph shield civilians from the majority of the falling debris and the mysterious girl helps destroy the main piece. Aided by Marlize, Team Flash restores Harry's intelligence to a functional level; he returns to Earth-2. Team Flash celebrates DeVoe's defeat with a returning Joe and Cecile's newborn daughter, Jenna. The mysterious girl arrives; she is Barry and Iris' daughter from the future, Nora; she claims to have made a ""big mistake.""

Casting: As stated in the beginning, the main cast members from the previous seasons mostly return. Grant Gustin as always delivers a terrific performance as Barry Allen. Neil Sandilands as Clifford DeVoe is a great Non-Speedster metahuman villain. Hartley Sawyer as Ralph Dibney was fun to watch here, I’d say Ralph’s best seasons are 4 and 5. Jessica Parker Kennedy makes her debut as Nora West-Allen, though if we want to be technical, she actually appears in Supergirl 3X08 “Crisis on Earth-X part one”. She’s just not confirmed as Barry’s daughter until this show’s season finale. Eobard Thawne returns to wreak havoc. The main Cast works well together. Another fun villain is Amunette Black. 5/5

Writing: Great Season, the Thinker storyline is fun to watch. Again an excellent alternative to what we get in later seasons. I am not a fan of the “We Are the Flash” bullshit this seasons got going on. If you to say “we’re in this together”, great. But WE (meaning Barry and Iris” aren’t the Flash. BARRY is the Flash. Ralph starts out as a dick, but turns out to be a fun character. As for  Nora West-Allen/XS I will definitely have more to talk about where she’s concerned next season. But I’m not a big fan of that character, Jessica Parker Kennedy is fine, she did the best she could with the material given, but slowly but surely her character gets annoying. Over all not a bad season. 3/5

Special Effects: The season looks great, the effects for Ralph’s morphing are cool to see. The Thinker’s chair is a fun addition. The fights are awesome. 5/5

Sound Effects and Music: Fantastic. 5/5

Entertainment and Replay Value: Solid season, I would recommend watching it even a rewatch. As this is the 4th season, it’s one of the last great seasons before Wallace came in to fuck the show up. 4/5

Season Total: 22/25

Final Score: 30/33

Final Thoughts: Great, Solid, and Fun season, one of the last before Wallace took over. It’s also the last that Andrew Kreisberg worked on as a Showrunner. Crisis on Earth-X is one of the best parts of this season. My favorite episodes are “The Flash Reborn”, “Mixed Signals”, “Crisis on Earth-X Part 3”, “Subject 9”, “Lose Yourself”, and “Think Fast” to name a few. My next review will be Legends Season 3. Will season 5 of The Flash be a good or better than this? Find out soon.",3,1755450191.0,ArrowVDisscussions,3,1.0,False
1mswb0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeardAndTested/comments/1mswb0p/showcase_the_best_over_the_range_microwave_ge/,Showcase the best over the range microwave GE Profile PVM9179SRSS,"I recently had the chance to test out the GE Profile PVM9179SRSS, which is an over-the-range microwave in stainless steel featuring an air fry function. As someone who spends quite a bit of time in the kitchen, I was genuinely curious to see if this appliance could not only serve as a typical microwave but also handle tasks like air frying without taking up additional counter space. After a couple of weeks using it for everything from reheating leftovers to crisping up fries, I feel like I’ve got some real-world feedback worth sharing.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this microwave is how sleek it looks. The stainless steel finish practically screams modern sophistication, and it complements a variety of kitchen styles. Fitting it over the range was surprisingly easy with the provided installation kit, though I did need a helper due to its weight—75 pounds, which isn't exactly light. The door feels solid, the control panel is intuitive, and the LED lighting beneath it is a nice touch for illuminating your stovetop. I appreciate small details like the fingerprint-resistant coating, which reduces the need to constantly wipe it down.

**Performance in Daily Use**  
One feature that stood out immediately was the air fryer function. As someone who frequently uses a standalone air fryer, I was initially skeptical. However, after testing it on chicken wings and frozen fries, I was genuinely impressed. The results were evenly cooked and crispy, although it did take slightly longer compared to a dedicated air fryer. The microwave itself is equally capable, heating food quickly and evenly without leaving cold spots. My coffee and soups always come out perfectly heated, which isn't the case with every microwave I’ve owned. The ventilation system effectively sucks up smoke and odors when I’m cooking on the stovetop below, another bonus I didn’t realize I’d appreciate so much.

**Interior Capacity and Functionality**  
With 1.7 cubic feet of space inside, this microwave doesn’t feel cramped. It easily fits my medium-sized casserole dishes, which is a pleasant surprise. The turntable spins consistently, and the sensor cooking feature is handy for those moments when I don’t want to guess cooking times. A particularly cool setting is the steam cleaning option, which makes maintaining the interior a breeze. Admittedly, I haven’t used it much yet, but the occasional “clean me” reminders will ensure I don’t slack off too long.  

[Check GE PVM9179SRSS price on Amazon.](https://cookarte.com/p/b0b8dzkbb7/)  

**Control Features and Settings**  
The control panel is straightforward, which is refreshing. I’ve seen microwave models with so many buttons that they feel like aircraft control panels. This one keeps things simple but functional. One-touch buttons for tasks like popcorn, reheating, or defrosting are all present, which I use almost daily. The combination of soft-touch and digital controls strikes a good balance between traditional and modern tech. Additionally, the LED display is bright and easy to read, even from a distance.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek and modern design that fits most kitchens.  
- Air fry functionality that delivers crispy results.  
- Spacious interior that accommodates larger dishes.  
- Excellent ventilation system for over-the-range use.  

**Negatives**  
- The air fryer, while good, isn’t as fast as a standalone unit.  
- Its weight makes installation somewhat tricky without assistance.  
 
**Competing Products**  
I’ve used a countertop Breville combination microwave before that also boasted an air fryer, though it didn’t have the over-the-range functionality. While the Breville offered comparable air frying performance, it lacked the seamless integration with venting out stovetop odors, something the GE Profile PVM9179SRSS handles effortlessly. Compared to the Panasonic NN-SN686S, which has similar sensor heating features, the GE model stands out for its capacity and dual-purpose air fry capabilities. However, the Panasonic is lighter and easier to manage if portability becomes a factor. Both options are strong, but I’d argue the GE model's design advantage and multifunctionality make it more versatile for a busy kitchen space.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Although it isn’t the cheapest on the market, the combination of features like air-frying, sensor cooking, and reliable venting adds significant value. It feels like an all-in-one appliance that truly earns its keep in the kitchen. You could buy a separate air fryer and microwave, but having one device that handles both, all while saving precious counter space, puts this product ahead in terms of cost-effectiveness.

  January, Five Weeks Earlier  
  
  Chelsea leaned down to Violet like she had a secret to tell, something she didn’t want anyone else to hear. “Check out the new eye candy!” Chelsea shouted, making Violet jump.  
  
  Violet was pretty sure that everyone in the cafeteria had just heard her friend. As usual, Chelsea’s internal filter seemed to be turned off.  
  
  Come to think of it, Violet couldn’t remember Chelsea ever screening her words.  
  
  The boy Chelsea was referring to happened to be walking right past them and, like everyone else, he’d heard her too—he would have had to be deaf not to hear—and he looked up in time to catch Violet glancing his way. Chelsea turned back to Jules and Claire, and pretended to laugh at something funny they’d said, giving the impression that it had been Violet who’d made the outrageous comment.  
  
  He smiled sheepishly at Violet and kept on walking. Violet felt her cheeks burning, and she was grateful that he at least had the good sense to look embarrassed by all the attention he was drawing. As humiliated as Violet was, she also felt a little sorry for him. It must suck to be the new kid in school. Even a really good-looking new kid.  
  
  As she watched, a girl joined him. Violet might have guessed from the resemblance—the similarity in coloring between the two of them—that they were related, except she didn’t have to guess; Violet already knew that the girl was his younger sister.  
  
  They had a new student every now and then at White River High School, but in a town as small as Buckley, Washington, the fact that there were two new students on the very same day was cause for major gossip. Even if they were brother and sister.  
  
  Violet watched the pair until they found a table at the far end of the cafeteria, away from the activity and the busier tables at the center of the large, noisy space, and then she turned to Chelsea.  
  
  “Thanks a lot, Chels. I’m sure that wasn’t at all awkward for him.” Violet glanced down and examined the contents of her plastic tray. The pizza looked greasy and runny, and the applesauce had a faintly grayish hue to it. The food made her lose her appetite altogether.  
  
  Chelsea grinned back at her. “No problem, Vi. You know me: I’m a giver. I just wanted to make him feel welcome.” She shoved a spoonful of the grim-looking applesauce into her mouth, smiling around the flimsy plastic utensil. She gazed over Violet’s shoulder to where the two new students sat by themselves. “If he didn’t want people talking about him, he probably shouldn’t look so tasty.” She was still gawking at them when her face wrinkled up and she pulled the spoon from her mouth. “What’s your boyfriend doing over there?”  
  
  Violet twisted in her seat so she could see what Chelsea was talking about just as Jay joined the two new kids at their table. He sat beside the girl, but he was already talking to her brother like they were old friends. And then he turned and pointed in Violet’s direction—right at her, in fact—and smiled when he saw that she was watching him. He waved at the same time the new guy looked up to see her studying them.  
  
  It was the second time she’d been caught staring at the new kid.  
  
  Violet tried to smile, but it didn’t actually reach her mouth. She thought about pretending she hadn’t seen them but realized it was too late, so before turning around she gave a halfhearted wave. She hoped the new boy wasn’t telling Jay that she’d just called him “eye candy” . . . especially since she hadn’t. Jay had been her best friend long before he was ever her boyfriend, so she hoped he would know she wasn’t the one who’d said it.  
  
  “Oh, look,” Claire announced, typically unaware of anyone else’s discomfort. “I think Jay’s inviting them over here.”  
  
  Of course he was. Why wouldn’t he be?  
  
  “Great,” Violet muttered under her breath. She didn’t bother turning around this time; instead she just glared at Chelsea.  
  
  Chelsea feigned innocence. “What? You don’t want New Boy to come sit with us? Claire and Jules don’t mind, do you?”  
  
  Jules was too busy eating to get involved in their conversation. The lanky tomboy looked like a prison inmate as she leaned over her tray, one arm wrapped protectively around it, shoveling the less-than-edible-looking food into her mouth.  
  
  Claire shook her head. “Of course not.”  
  
  Chelsea continued, “You are one lucky girl, Violet. That boyfriend of yours has a heart of gold. He’s just trying to make the new guy feel at home.” And then she added, “Yet, when I do it, you get all bent and give me dirty looks. You should try being a little more like Jay and me. Try opening up your  
heart . . . just a little.”  
  
  “Oh wait. Never mind,” Claire announced, ignoring Chelsea. “The new kids are staying where they are. But here comes Jay.”  
  
  Violet shot a warning look at Chelsea as Jay sat down beside her. He slipped his hand beneath the back of her shirt, tracing his thumb across the small of her back. It was so familiar, his touch, yet disarming at the same time. Violet leaned into him and he kissed her forehead. His lips were soft but left her skin tingling. She could hardly believe that her stomach still did somersaults whenever he was near.  
  
  “What are you guys talking about?” Jay asked, and Violet wondered if she only imagined the implication she heard in his words.  
  
  Chelsea smiled sweetly. “We were just curious about your new friends over there. Well . . . more about him than her.”  
  
  Chelsea Morrison was a pretty girl. She had smooth skin; a slim, athletic body; and shiny, chestnut-colored hair. It wasn’t until she opened her mouth that the near-perfect illusion of femininity was shattered. Fortunately for Chelsea, she couldn’t care less what people thought of her . . . one way or the other. Chelsea refused to conform to what anyone else expected her to be.  
  
  Jay chuckled at Chelsea. “You mean Mike?” he asked, giving the new kid a name. “I was just asking if he wanted to come sit with us, but for some reason”—he glanced at Violet with raised eyebrows—“he didn’t want to. Is there anything you want to tell me? Like why Mike might prefer not to sit at the same table with you?”  
  
  “It wasn’t me . . . it was her!” Violet, nearly choking on the bite of soggy pizza she was trying to swallow, pointed at Chelsea.  
  
  Chelsea laughed, and even Jules stopped stuffing her face long enough to smile appreciatively. Claire was the only one who remained straight-faced, mostly because she didn’t seem to be listening anymore. Her fingers worked viciously over the keys of her cell phone; she was absorbed in a long series of text messages . . . probably to someone sitting only a few tables away.  
  
  “I know,” Jay admitted. “Chelsea’s the only girl at this school who would actually have the balls to say something like that right in front of someone.”  
  
  Chelsea did her best to look indignant, her eyes widening in mock outrage. “Whatever! Why couldn’t it have been Jules? Or Claire?”  
  
  “What? I didn’t say anything,” Claire piped in, suddenly paying attention.  
  
  Chelsea rolled her eyes at Claire’s serious tone. “Paranoid much? No one was actually accusing you of anything. Besides, what do I care if he knows it was me? There’s nothing wrong with noticing that he’s . . . mmm, delicious. If he plays his cards right, he could end up as Mr. Chelsea.”  
  
  “As if that’s even possible, Chels,” Claire declared. “The guy doesn’t change his name; you’d have to change yours.”  
  
  Chelsea rolled her eyes again, this time so that Claire couldn’t see her, as she visibly bit back her irritation. “Thanks for the lesson in social convention, Claire-bear.”  
  
  Claire shrugged and smiled ingenuously. “No problem.”  
  
  Violet glanced at Jay, grinning over Claire’s innate ability to annoy Chelsea without repercussions.  
  
  Violet envied Claire for that. But she knew that the only reason Chelsea didn’t turn her wrath on Claire was because, more than anything else in the world, Chelsea hated apologizing. So somehow, with a strength of will that she was unable to find when dealing with anyone else, Chelsea managed to curb her temper when it came to Claire’s sensitive feelings.  
  
  Violet found it highly entertaining.  
  
  But Jay was grinning back at Violet for an entirely different reason. He bent toward her, and sparks of anticipation crackled through her body. His lips quietly brushed over hers, right there in the middle of the crowded cafeteria, just the whisper of a kiss. Yet Violet was powerless to stop him.  
  
  Even if she’d wanted to, her body never seemed to follow the simplest of instructions when it came to Jay. He was like her Kryptonite.  
  
  Chelsea stared at them disgustedly. “Will you guys stop it already? I think I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.” She shuddered exaggeratedly. “If you can’t wait until you’re alone, I’m gonna have to ask you to find another place to sit.” And then her short attention span got the best of her, and she nodded her head in the direction of Mike and his sister. “So what’s their story?”  
  
  Jay shrugged. “I have no idea; I just met him today. He’s in my first-period class. His family just moved here. That’s about all I know.”  
  
  “Why here?” Jules asked, and Violet had to admit that she was wondering the exact same thing.  
  
  It wasn’t as if Buckley was a first-choice kind of town. And it didn’t have particularly easy access to anywhere important. It was more of a pass-through city on a small stretch of highway that headed nowhere in particular.  
  
  Jay shrugged again.  
  
  “That’s weird. You should find out,” Chelsea commanded. “What about her? Does she have a name? Not that I care really, but it would be rude to call her ‘new girl’ once Mike and I are dating.”  
  
  “I have an idea,” Jay suggested, leaning toward Chelsea from across the table. “Why don’t you put together a list of questions, in order of importance, and I’ll have him fill out the answers? Kind of like new-kid homework.” He smiled innocently. “You don’t have to do it now, of course; just try to get it to me before the end of the day.”  
  
  “Ha-ha.” Chelsea made a face. “You’re freakin’ hilarious, Jay.” And then she turned to Violet. “That must be why you like him so much. ’Cause other than that, I just don’t get it.”  
  
  Claire’s brow creased, as though Chelsea’s statement didn’t make sense. She decided to help Violet out. “No, he’s cute too.” And when Jules started laughing, she added, “Well, he is!”  
  
  Chelsea was unmoved by Claire’s explanation and, as usual, had to have the last word. “No offense, Violet, but no one’s that cute. That’s all I have to say about it.” And then, in usual Chelsea fashion, she changed the subject before Jay had the chance to remind them all that he was sitting right there. “Hey, don’t forget, we’ve got a date on Saturday.”  
  
  “I didn’t forget,” Violet assured her. “I’ll take any excuse I can to go into the city.”  
  
  Besides, Chelsea might be obnoxious, but Violet knew they’d have fun. Plus it was a chance to get out of Buckley for the day. . . . She wasn’t about to turn down an opportunity like that.  
  
  At the sound of her uncle’s voice coming from the back door, Jay threw Violet off his lap.  
  
  Violet giggled as she hit the cushions on the back of the couch.  
  
  “What are you doing?” she complained. “It’s just Uncle Stephen.”  
  
  Jay sat up. “I know, but ever since the Homecoming Dance, I feel like he’s always watching us. I just don’t want him to think we’re doing anything we shouldn’t be.”  
  
  The Homecoming Dance. It had been almost three months since that night, but the memories still made Violet shudder.  
  
  Not a day went by that she wasn’t grateful Jay was still alive. Grateful the bullet from the killer’s gun had only grazed his shoulder, despite the fact that the man—one of her uncle’s own officers—had been aiming directly for Jay’s heart.  
  
  If her uncle hadn’t shown up at the dance when he did, firing the fatal shot that took the killer down, neither she nor Jay would have made it out of there alive.  
  
  Jay had always liked her uncle before then, but now it was something closer to worship. And even though Jay would never admit it out loud, Violet suspected that Jay felt indebted to her uncle for saving his life . . . a debt he knew he would never be able to repay.  
  
  A debt he wouldn’t even owe if it weren’t for Violet. It was Violet’s fault that he’d been in that situation in the first place. Violet and her . . . ability.  
  
  All because she was different. In more ways than most people could, or would ever, understand.  
  
  The dead called to Violet.  
  
  They used echoes that only Violet could sense, pulling her onward, steering her to the  
ir locations. These echoes came in many forms. Smells, sounds, sometimes an inexplicable color. Anything.  
  
  Yet not all the dead had echoes, only those who had died prematurely, their lives cut short by the actions of others. And it wasn’t just the dead who stood out to Violet but also those who had killed. They bore a mark as well: an imprint identical to the echo of their victim.  
  
  The imprint might fade, yes, but only over time. And only slightly. It would remain with them forever, in some form, an unambiguous reminder of the life they’d stolen. A reminder they would unwittingly carry with them.  
  
  And Violet was the only one who knew it was there. She was the only one who would ever see, or feel, or taste, what they had done.  
  
  They couldn’t hide it from her.  
  
  “What are you two doing?” Her uncle’s teasing voice came into the room before he did. But his voice was the second warning that they were no longer alone, since Violet had tasted his presence long before he’d actually stepped into her house. Ever since saving her and Jay at Homecoming, her uncle carried an imprint of his own. The bitter taste of dandelions still smoldered on Violet’s tongue whenever he was near. A taste that Violet had grown to accept. And even, to some degree, to appreciate. “Nothing your parents wouldn’t approve of, I hope,” he added.  
  
  Violet flashed Jay a wicked grin. “We were just making out, so if you could make this quick, we’d really appreciate it.”  
Jay jumped up from beside her. “She’s kidding,” he blurted out. “We weren’t doing anything.”  
  
  Her uncle Stephen stopped where he was and eyed them both carefully. Violet could’ve sworn she felt Jay squirming, even though every single muscle in his body was frozen in place. Violet smiled at her uncle, trying her best to look guilty-as-charged.  
  
  Finally he raised his eyebrows, every bit the suspicious police officer. “Your parents asked me to stop by and check on you on my way home. They won’t be back until late. Can I trust the two of you here . . . alone?”  
  
  “Of course you can—” Jay started to say.  
  
  “Probably not—” Violet answered at the same time. And then she caught a glimpse of the horror-stricken expression on Jay’s face, and she laughed. “Relax, Uncle Stephen, we’re fine. We were just doing homework.”  
  
  Her uncle looked at the pile of discarded books on the table in front of the couch. Not one of them was open. He glanced skeptically at Violet but didn’t say a word.  
  
  “We may have gotten a little distracted,” she responded, and again she saw Jay shifting nervously.  
  
  After several warnings, and a promise from Violet that she would lock the doors behind him, Uncle Stephen finally left the two of them alone again.  
  
  Jay was glaring at Violet when she peeked at him as innocently as she could manage. “Why would you do that to me?”  
  
  “Why do you care what he thinks we’re doing?” Violet had been trying to get Jay to admit his new hero worship of her uncle for months, but he was too stubborn—or maybe he honestly didn’t realize it himself—to confess it to her.  
  
  “Because, Violet,” he said dangerously, taking a threatening step toward her. But his scolding was ruined by the playful glint in his eyes. “He’s your uncle, and he’s the police chief. Why poke the bear?”  
  
  Violet took a step back, away from him, and he matched it, moving toward her. He was stalking her around the coffee table now, and Violet couldn’t help giggling as she retreated.  
  
  But it was too late for her to escape. Jay was faster than she was, and his arms captured her before she’d ever had a chance. Not that she’d really tried.  
  
  He hauled her back down onto the couch, the two of them falling heavily into the cushions, and this time he pinned her beneath him.  
  
  “Stop it!” she shrieked, not meaning a single word. He was the last person in the world she wanted to get away from.  
  
  “I don’t know . . .” he answered hesitantly. “I think you deserve to be punished.” His breath was balmy against her cheek, and she found herself leaning toward him rather than away. “Maybe we should do some more homework.”  
  
  Homework had been their code word for making out before they’d realized that they hadn’t been fooling anyone.  
  
  But Jay was true to his word, especially his code word, and his lips settled over hers. Violet suddenly forgot that she was pretending to break free from his grip. Her frail resolve crumbled. She reached out, wrapping her arms around his neck, and pulled him closer to her.  
  
  Jay growled from deep in his throat. “Okay, homework it is.”  
  
  He pulled her against him, until they were lying face-to-face, stretched across the length of the couch. It wasn’t long before she was restless, her hands moving impatiently, exploring him. She shuddered when she felt his fingers slip beneath her shirt and brush over her bare skin. He stroked her belly and higher, the skin of his hands rough against her soft flesh. His thumb brushed the base of her rib cage, making her breath catch.  
  
  And then, like so many times before, he stopped, abruptly drawing back. He shifted only inches, but those inches felt like miles, and Violet felt the familiar surge of frustration.  
  
  He didn’t say a word; he didn’t have to. Violet understood perfectly. They’d gone too far. Again. But Violet was frustrated, and it was getting harder and harder to ignore her disappointment. She knew they couldn’t play this unsatisfying game forever.  
  
  “So you’re going to Seattle tomorrow?” He used the question to fill the rift between them, but his voice shook and Violet was glad he wasn’t totally unaffected.  
  
  She wasn’t as quick to pretend that everything was okay, especially when what she really wanted to do was to rip his shirt off and unbutton his jeans.  
  
  But they’d talked about this. And, time and time again, they’d decided that they needed to be sure. One hundred percent. Because once they crossed that line . . .  
  
  She and Jay had been best friends since the first grade, and up until last fall that’s all they’d ever been. Now that she was in love with him, she couldn’t imagine losing him because they made the wrong decision.  
  
  Or made it too soon.  
  
  She decided to let Jay have his small talk. For now.  
  
  “Yeah, Chelsea wants to go down to the waterfront and maybe do some shopping. It’s easier to be around her when it’s just the two of us. You know, when she’s not always . . . on.”  
  
  “You mean when she’s not picking on someone?”  
  
  “Exactly.”  
  
  Jay’s brow furrowed, and for a moment Violet wondered what he was thinking. Then he smiled at her as he tucked his hand behind his head, getting comfortable again. His eyes glittered mischievously, reminding Violet that he was still her best friend. “You know she made me a list, don’t you?”  
  
  “What do you mean?”  
  
  “A list. Chelsea made me a list of questions to ask Mike.”  
  
  Violet laughed, pulling herself up. It was too ridiculous to believe. But it was Chelsea, so of course it was true.  
  
  “What did you do with it? You didn’t give it to him, did you?” Violet asked, her eyes wide with shock.  
  
  Jay sat up too and grinned, and Violet was sure that he had. And then he shook his head. “Nah. I told her if she really wanted the answers, she’d have to give it to him herself.”  
  
  Violet relaxed back into the couch. “Did she?”  
  
  Jay shrugged. “I dunno. You never know with Chelsea.” He leaned forward, watching Violet closely as he ran his thumb down the side of her cheek. “Anyway,” he said, switching the subject, “I get off work at six tomorrow; maybe we can hook up after that.” He moved closer, grinning. “And you can tell me how much you missed me.”  
  
  He kissed her, at first quickly. Then the kiss deepened, and she heard him groan. This time, when he pulled back, there was indecision in his eyes.  
  
  Violet wanted to say something sarcastic and sharp-witted to lighten the mood, but with Jay staring at her like that, any hope of finding a clever response was lost. She could feel herself disappearing into the depths of that uncertain look.  
  
  She ignored the common sense that warned her not to lean in for another kiss. She much preferred giving in to that other part of her. The part that wanted more, the part that told her: Don’t stop.  
  
  And when Jay didn’t back away either, she realized that she wasn’t the only one who was disregarding logic tonight.  
  
  Her heart skipped beats, fluttering madly, as their lips finally touched.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  Violet was sitting at the kitchen table when her dad came down, already dressed for work. According to the clock, it was only five fifteen. On a Saturday.  
  
  “I made coffee.” Violet kept her voice low, even though there wasn’t a chance in hell they’d wake her mom at this hour.  
  
  Her dad ignored her comment and instead sat beside her. “What’s the matter, Vi? Couldn’t sleep?” He frowned, looking even more serious than usual. “Was it the dream again?”  
  
  Violet gritted her teeth. Of course it was the dream. It was always the dream—a faceless man chasing her—waking her night after night, a scream wedged painfully, noiselessly, against the hollow of her throat.  
  
  She hated the dream.  
  
  “Third night this week,” she sighed. “At least I almost made it till morning this time.”  
  
  Her father pressed his hand over hers. It was a gentle, reassuring gesture. “You’re safe, baby. No one can hurt you now.” He squeezed tighter, trying to convince her. “Y  
ou and Jay, you’re both safe.”  
  
  “I know it’s just a dream.” She shrugged, drawing her hand away. She took another bite of her cereal, smiling weakly and pretending that she believed her own words.  
  
  If only it didn’t feel so real. . . .  
  
  But she knew he was right; it was just a nightmare, nothing more. It didn’t mean anything.  
  
  Besides, it wasn’t like she was psychic. Psychics had abilities that were actually useful; they could predict the future, see things before they happened.  
  
  Violet’s skill was something else altogether: She could only locate the dead. And only after they’d been murdered.  
  
  It was a painful ability to have—one that she’d been able to use once, when a pair of serial killers had hunted girls in the area. But, of course, she hadn’t been able to save their victims. She had only helped locate the killers, to stop them from killing again.  
  
  Yes, maybe she was special, but if she’d had her way, she would have chosen to be psychic. Or, better yet, completely normal.  
  
  Unfortunately, Violet was never given a choice in the matter.  
  
  Chelsea was only a half hour late. Not bad by Chelsea standards.  
  
  She honked from out in the driveway, a long, inconsiderate blare. Even Chelsea’s car was obnoxious.  
  
  Violet made an apologetic face to her mom before heading out the door.  
  
  Chelsea honked a second time as Violet jumped down the front porch steps.  
  
  “Nice, Chels. What if my parents were still sleeping?” Violet accused as she slid inside the car’s warm interior.  
  
  “Yeah, right. Your dad’s like a farmer. He’s the early-to-bed-early-to-rise kind of guy. And I really doubt your mom sleeps past ten, even on a Saturday.” She gave Violet a sideways glance and raised her eyebrows. “Am I wrong?”  
  
  “Not this morning,” Violet admitted. “But you could have been.”  
  
  But it was pointless to argue; Chelsea was already turning up her stereo.  
  
  Late January was not the usual tourist season downtown, especially not on Seattle’s waterfront. In the summertime, it was bustling with activity: shoppers, tourists, impromptu street concerts, artists, and restaurants all squeezed in tightly along the piers. This time of year there was still activity, but the crowds were anemic, people nestled inside their warm winter coats and clutching umbrellas beneath the low-lying gray clouds.  
  
  Chelsea didn’t seem to notice the weather or the lack of fanfare on the streets. “We should totally take a ferry out to one of the islands,” she begged breathlessly.  
  
  Violet grinned. “All right. Which one should we take?”  
  
  Violet could remember riding the ferries with her parents when she was little. They would buy her hot cocoa from the concession stand and then huddle up at the railings and watch the choppy black waves of the Puget Sound.  
  
  Chelsea jumped up and down, the enthusiasm on her face making her look younger, less jaded. “Let’s just take the first one we can get!”  
  
  Violet laughed. This was why she liked hanging out with Chelsea by herself; she was a different person when no one else was watching.  
  
  According to the schedule, there was an island run due to leave in a little over an hour. They bought their tickets and wandered around the piers before it was time to board.  
  
  They stopped at Ye Olde Curiosity Shop, a tourist favorite crammed with freakshow oddities, where Chelsea bought a necklace with a creepy shrunken head dangling from the chain. And before they left, they asked the guy behind the counter to take a picture of the two of them standing in front of a petrified pig that was on display.  
  
  Once they were outside, it was just starting to drizzle, and Violet tugged the hood of her coat over her head.  
  
  The feeling, the quivering vibrations, struck her long before the sound.  
  
  That unmistakable shiver beneath her skin was followed immediately by the inexorable sensation of being summoned, as if something reached into the very core of her and tugged. She could no more ignore the pull than she could deny what it was.  
  
  Something dead was calling to her.  
  
  The noise that chased the vibrations, reaching her at last, was distinctly out of place along the edge of the Puget Sound’s rough winter waters.  
  
  In the summertime it might have found an anonymous place among the street performers who set up along the piers to attract tourists. But now, in the dead of winter, the instrumental sound of a harp, like the one Violet imagined angels might play, was at odds with her surroundings. It would have been soothing—the acoustic whispers—had it not been for the fact that it signaled the presence of a body . . . human or otherwise.  
  
  Violet was rooting for otherwise.  
  
  “Where are we going?” Chelsea asked, piercing Violet’s concentration as she struggled to hold on to the precarious sounds reaching out to her.  
  
  Violet hadn’t even realized that she’d been walking away from the waterfront shops. She paused, lifting her hand. “I think I heard something,” she explained absently.  
  
  She thought about resisting the urge to follow the sound, just ignoring it, especially here . . . with Chelsea, who knew nothing about her friend’s “gift.” Besides, what did she think she would do once she found the body that beckoned her? There was no place to bury it, and she certainly couldn’t take it with her.  
  
  Sometimes when she was near a body, she felt drawn toward it, compelled to find it.  
  
  Usually when Violet found an animal, the casualty of a feral predator, she could take care of it herself. She had her own graveyard. Grim, yes, but a necessity for any girl with the ability to locate the dead.  
  
  If it turned out to be a person, however, that was another story altogether.  
  
  Once an echo called to her, and before the body was suitably buried, no matter how long or short that span might be, Violet remained unsettled. It wasn’t until the body was given a final resting place of its own that the echo would fade, falling into the backdrop of her consciousness, never disappearing altogether but weakening, becoming something less . . . haunting.  
  
  On that day, Violet could breathe again.  
  
  Instead of trying to resist the pull she felt now, she heard herself saying, “Stay here, Chels. I’ll be right back.” She didn’t wait for her friend to answer as she wandered away.  
  
  It took a moment for Violet to locate the direction again, as the sound drew her away from the piers.  
  
  It was farther than she’d expected, and she was only moderately aware that the scenery around her was changing dramatically. Beneath her skin, the stringed harp continued to strum.  
  
  On the other side of the road, across the street from the waters of the Puget Sound, she walked past the charming antique shops and faded brick facades of old Seattle. She moved toward the shipping docks ahead of her. Tall chain-link fencing topped with barbed wire appeared, in stark contrast to the cobblestone sidewalks and worn timbers of the wharves she left behind. Large cracks split the uneven concrete she trod upon.  
  
  Signs hanging from the fencing read: Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted.  
  
  Behind the chain-link, huge steel shipping containers were stacked on top of one another, end to end, creating impenetrable fortifications, shielding from view piles of industrial-grade pallets and an army of forklifts. Massive red steel cranes stood high above the containers. Several cargo ships floated in the waters beyond.  
  
  Seagulls, some vivid white and some the color of dirty dishwater, landed intermittently on the grounds, scouring for scraps of food.  
  
  It was Saturday, and the shipyards were practically deserted, with only a few cars parked in the outer lots. But the large central gate stood open.  
  
  Violet slipped inside without notice. She was too preoccupied to care if anyone spotted her. The gentle sound of the harps grew stronger until the vibrations were nearly painful and Violet found herself gritting her teeth. It was compelling, this echo . . . this death. And Violet was so close.  
  
  She moved around a towering row of cargo containers that were painted in dull shades of red, blue, and steel gray.  
/>   The briny smell of salt water was crisp in the air, and she wondered at how it had gone unnoticed by her before now. Now it seemed so significant. The salt water and the harp. And the body.  
  
  She stopped, suddenly aware that she was no longer alone.  
  
  The skin at the back of her neck tightened, prickling. Someone was behind her; someone was watching her.  
  
  She held her breath, afraid to turn around. And even more afraid not to. She’d felt this before, this sensation of being stalked. Every muscle in her body was strained and tense.  
  
  But she had no choice; she had to find out who was there.  
  
  One . . . two . . .  
  
  Before she reached three, she felt someone grab her arm, gripping her tightly.  
  
  Violet jerked, her heart crashing inside her chest.  
  
  And Chelsea shrieked, worry clouding her face as Violet turned to stare at her, her eyes wide. Chelsea’s hand shot up to cover her own mouth.  
  
  “Chels, what the hell? I thought I told you to wait!” Violet hissed, dragging Chelsea closer to the containers, where no one would be able to see them.  
  
  Chelsea reached for Violet’s hand. “What did you think you heard, Vi?”  
  
  Violet lifted a cautionary finger to her lips, warning Chelsea to be silent as she moved in front of her, concentrating once more on the sound of the harp. She could hear Chelsea breathing heavily directly behind her, and she wondered if the other girl was afraid. . . . It felt like she was afraid. But Violet didn’t pause to find out.  
  
  Violet was confused. She was in the right place; the sound was practically within her now in the same way the reverberating echo was, beating soft strings from inside her chest and spreading out to her head . . . her fingers . . . her toes.  
  
  But there was nothing here.  
  
  Only shipping containers stranded on a vast expanse of blacktop. All solid. And sealed.  
  
  She looked up at the red cargo container in front of her; its corrugated steel walls were impassable.  
  
  She moved around it, reaching out to brush her fingertips along the rough surface, examining the faultless seams and feeling the sound beneath her scalp. Her skin prickled. She finally found the door of the shipping vessel, but it was apparent that it was not an opening Violet could access. It was sealed tight, a large, rusty padlock hanging securely from a thick metal loop.

We have a lot in common.  Both divorced.  Kids in college.  Similar interests.

I have his direct cell phone number, that was how we set it up.

Would it be completely inappropriate for me to text him to maybe go meet for coffee or something?

I know if I was the male handyman you would say it was creepy and wrong to contact a female customer.

Is it still creepy and wrong when I’m the female customer?",20,1755450086.0,WhatShouldIDo,156,0.64,False

Choose a Chromebook if you live online and want something fast, secure, and affordable. Choose a laptop if you need specific software, gaming, or maximum flexibility.

Hey Reddit! I keep seeing this question pop up everywhere, so figured I'd share my experience after using both Chromebooks and Windows/Mac laptops for the past 5+ years. I'm not trying to sell you anything - just want to help you avoid the frustration of picking the wrong device.

# What's the Real Difference?

# Chromebook = Web Browser + Android Apps

* Runs Chrome OS (basically a fancy web browser)
* Built mainly for online tasks and cloud storage
* Boots in seconds, updates automatically
* Most apps are web-based or from Google Play Store

# Laptop = Full Computer

* Runs Windows, macOS, or Linux
* Can install any software (Photoshop, Steam games, etc.)
* More powerful hardware options
* Works fully offline

Think of it this way: A Chromebook is like a smartphone in laptop form, while a traditional laptop is like a desktop computer you can carry around.

# My Real-World Experience

I've daily-driven both, and here's what I've learned:

# Chromebooks Are Amazing When:

* **You live in Google's ecosystem** \- Gmail, Google Docs, Drive, Photos all work seamlessly
* **You're always connected** \- WiFi at home, work, coffee shops
* **You want zero maintenance** \- Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform, no viruses, automatic updates
* **Battery life matters** \- Most models last 10 to 12 hours on a single charge — enough to get through a full day of school or remote work
* **You're on a budget** \- Great laptops starting around $300

**Real example**: I took a Chromebook on a business trip to avoid carrying a charger, and it lasted from my morning coffee to evening client meetings without dropping below 30%. That kind of efficiency is a game-changer.

# Laptops Are Better When:

* **You need specific software** \- Full desktop software like Photoshop, AutoCAD, or Microsoft Access
* **You game seriously** \- Windows laptops offer compatibility with a wide range of gaming titles, including resource-intensive games
* **You work offline frequently** \- Planes, remote areas, unreliable internet
* **You need lots of storage** \- Video files, large projects, photo libraries
* **You multitask heavily** \- Running multiple demanding programs simultaneously

**Real example**: My graphic designer friend tried switching to a Chromebook ""just for portability."" That lasted exactly one week - he was back to his MacBook the moment he needed Adobe Illustrator.

# The 2025 Reality Check

**Chromebooks have seriously evolved:**

* Many Chromebook models feature powerful processors, premium displays and even touchscreen support, making them a compelling alternative to a regular laptop for plenty of users
* New ARM chips giving 17+ hour battery life
* OLED screens in $600-700 models
* Thanks to cloud gaming platforms like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce Now, you can even stream AAA games on some models

# But laptops are still laptops:

* More powerful than ever
* Better value in the $800+ range
* Essential for professional work

# Money Talk - What You Actually Get

Budget ($200-400):

* **Chromebook wins easily** \- The CX15 is totally worth a look because it's great for anyone who mostly browses the web and watches YouTube videos
* Budget Windows laptops are often frustrating

**Mid-range ($400-700):**

* **Chromebooks** \- Premium features, excellent build quality
* **Laptops** \- Entry-level but capable machines

**High-end ($700+):**

* **Chromebooks** \- Luxury features but still limited software
* **Laptops** \- Where they really shine, powerful and versatile

# Common Myths Busted

**""Chromebooks are just toys""** \- False. These Chromebook laptops can squeeze a better user experience from less powerful hardware, helping to keep them cheaper

**""You can't do real work on a Chromebook""** \- Depends on your work. Web dev, writing, research, data analysis - all totally doable.

**""Chromebooks don't work offline""** \- Many Chrome apps and extensions allow you to work offline, syncing your changes when you're back online

**""Laptops are always better""** \- Not if you just browse Reddit and Netflix!

# Who Should Get What?

# Get a Chromebook if you:

* Spend 90% of your time in a web browser
* Use Google Workspace for work/school
* Want something that ""just works""
* Value long battery life and fast startup
* Are buying for kids/elderly parents
* Need a lightweight travel companion

# Get a laptop if you:

* Need Windows/Mac-specific software
* Do photo/video editing
* Game beyond casual mobile games
* Work with large local files
* Code with complex development environments
* Want maximum flexibility

# My Personal Recommendations (2025)

**Best Chromebooks:**

* **Budget**: ASUS Chromebook CX15 (\~$300)
* **Best overall**: Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 starts at $649 and is the one of the first to use the ARM-based MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910 chip
* **Students**: Acer Chromebook Spin 312 (under $500)

**Best laptops for Chromebook buyers:**

* **Budget**: Look for Ryzen 5 laptops around $500-600
* **Mid-range**: Dell Inspiron or HP Pavilion series
* **Performance**: Anything with 16GB RAM and SSD

# The Honest Bottom Line

Chromebooks excel in simplicity, security, and affordability, making them ideal for users who primarily work with web-based applications and value ease of use. Windows laptops offer greater versatility, power, and software compatibility, making them better suited for users who require specialized applications or need a more traditional computing experience.

**Most people would be happy with a Chromebook** \- seriously. If you're reading this on a phone or tablet most of the day, a Chromebook will handle your laptop needs just fine.

**But if you know you need specific software or maximum power, don't compromise** \- get a proper laptop.

The worst thing you can do is get the wrong device and spend two years frustrated with it. Think honestly about what you actually do, not what you think you might do someday.

# Questions I Always Get:

**""Can I run Microsoft Office?""** \- Yes. Many schools in League City use Google Workspace, making Chromebooks a simple, affordable, and compatible choice for students. Also web versions work fine.

**""What about gaming?""** \- Casual games and cloud gaming work. Serious PC gaming needs a Windows laptop.

**""How long do they last?""** \- Google announced that Chromebooks would get software updates and support for an impressive 10 years after their release date

**""Can I code on it?""** \- Yes! Web development, Python, even Android development work great. Heavy IDEs... not so much.

**""Is it really that secure?""** \- The Chrome OS automatically updates in the background, ensuring that you always have the latest security patches and fixes

Hope this helps! I tried to be as honest as possible based on real experience. Happy to answer specific questions in the comments.

  I was locked in the library trying not to panic. Literally locked. As in, no escape. Every door, every window, every air vent. Okay, I hadn’t tried the air vents, but I was seriously considering it. I wasn’t desperate enough . . . yet. My friends would realize what had happened and they’d come back and free me, I assured myself. I just had to wait.  
  
  It all started when I had to go to the bathroom. Well, before that there had been a lot of soda—a two-liter of Dr Pepper that Morgan had smuggled into the library. I had drunk more than my fair share of the bottle when Jeff sat down next to me, smelling like trees and sky and sunlight every time he leaned over to ask my opinion.  
  
  It wasn’t until the windows darkened to black, the librarians asked us to leave, and we made it all the way to the underground parking garage where the fifteen of us were dividing into four cars that I realized I wasn’t going to make it down the street, let alone all the way to the canyon campfire.  
  
  “I have to pee,” I announced after I plopped my bag into Jeff’s trunk. Lisa rolled down her window. Her car, parked next to Jeff’s, was already running. “I thought you were coming in my car, Autumn.” She gave me a knowing smile. She knew I wanted to go with Jeff.  
  
  I smiled too. “I’ll be right back. There is no toilet at the bonfire.”  
  
  “There are a lot of trees,” Jeff said, rounding the car and slamming his trunk shut. It echoed through the nearly empty garage. In his car I could now see three heads in the backseat and a fourth in the passenger seat. No. They all beat me to it. I would have to go with Lisa after all. No big deal, I’d have plenty of time to talk to Jeff at the bonfire. It wasn’t in my nature to be bold in my declarations of undying affection, but with my limbs all jittery from nearly two liters of caffeine and Lisa’s warning about Avi stealing Jeff out from under me buzzing in my head, I felt powerful.  
  
  I rushed back down the long hall, up the stairs, and through the glass walkway that overlooked a courtyard. When I made it to the main floor of the library, half the lights were already out.  
  
  The library was too big and needed more bathrooms, I decided by the time I made it there. I pushed open the heavy wooden door and quickly found a stall. The box holding the paper seat covers was empty. Looked like I’d have to hover.  
  
  As I was zipping my pants back up, the lights went out. I let out a yelp then laughed. “Funny, guys.” Dallin, Jeff’s best friend, had no doubt found the breaker. It seemed like something he would do.  
  
  The lights remained out, though, and no laughing followed my scream. They must’ve been on motion detectors. I waved my hands. Nothing. I inched forward, feeling along the door, trying not to think about all the germs clinging to it, until I found the lock and slid it open. A streetlight shone through an upper window, so I was able to see just enough for a thorough hand washing. It was an eco-friendly bathroom, meaning only air dryers. I wiped my hands on my jeans, opting for speed over the most inefficient way ever to dry hands. My reflection in the mirror was only a shadow, but I leaned forward anyway to see if my makeup was smudged. From what I could tell, it looked fine.  
  
  Out in the hall only a few random overhead lights illuminated the way. The place was completely shut down. I picked up my pace. The library at night was creepier than I’d thought it could be. The ten-foot-long enclosed glass hallway sparkled as snow began to fall outside. I didn’t linger like I was tempted to. Hopefully the snow wouldn’t affect the bonfire. If it stayed light, it would make it magical. A perfect night for confessions. Jeff wasn’t going to freak out when I told him, was he? No, he’d been flirting with me all night. He’d even picked the same era as I had for the history essay. I didn’t think that was a coincidence.  
  
  As for the cabin with the girls after the bonfire, the snow would be perfect. Maybe we’d get snowed in. That had happened once before. At first it had stressed me out but it ended up the best weekend ever—hot chocolate and tubing and ghost stories.  
  
  I reached the door to the parking garage and gave the metal bar a shove. It didn’t budge. I pushed a second time. Nothing. “Jeff! Dallin! You’re not funny!” I pressed my nose against the glass, but as far as I could see both ways there were absolutely no cars or people. “Lisa?”  
  
  Out of habit, I reached for my cell phone. My hand met only the empty pocket of my jeans. I’d put my black weekend bag with all my stuff—cell phone, clothes, jacket, purse, snacks, camera, medication—in Jeff’s trunk.  
  
  No.  
  
  I ran the entire library, searching for another way out. A way that apparently didn’t exist. Six doors to the outside and they were all locked. And so there I was—back leaned up against the door to the parking garage, its cold seeping into my skin—stuck in a big empty library, caffeine and anxiety battling it out in my body.  
  
  A heart-fluttering panic worked its way up my chest and took my breath away. Calm down. They’ll be back, I told myself. There had just been too many people getting into too many different cars. They all thought I was with someone else. Once the four cars reached the bonfire, someone would notice I wasn’t there and they’d come back.  
  
  I calculated the time that would take. Thirty minutes up the canyon, thirty minutes back. I’d be here for an hour. Well, then they’d have to find someone with a key to open this door. But that wouldn’t take much longer. They’d all have phones. They could call the fire department if they had to. Okay, now I was getting dramatic. No emergency departments would have to be called.  
  
  My pep talk helped. This was nothing to get worked up about.  
  
  I didn’t want to leave my post for fear my friends wouldn’t see me when they came back. Or I wouldn’t see or hear them. But without my phone or my camera I had no way of passing the time. I started humming a song very badly, then laughed at my effort. Maybe I’d just count the holes in the ceiling panels or . . . I looked around and came up empty. How did people pass the time without cell phones?  
  
  “. . . skies are blue. Birds fly over the rainbow.” My singing wasn’t going to earn me a record deal anytime soon, but that hadn’t stopped me from belting out a few songs at the top of my lungs. I stopped, my throat raw. It had been at least an hour.  
  
&n  
bsp; My butt was numb and the chill from the floor had crept up my body, making me shiver. They must turn the heat down on the weekend. I stood and stretched. Maybe this place had a phone somewhere. I hadn’t thought to look until now. I’d never had to look for a phone. I always had my phone with me.  
  
  For the seventh time that night I walked back through the glass walkway. Everything was white now. The ground was covered in snow, the trees frosted with it. I wished I had my camera with me to capture the contrast of the scene—the dark lines of the building and trees against the stark whiteness of the snow. I didn’t, so I kept walking.  
  
  I started in the entryway, but couldn’t find a phone anywhere. There might have been one in the locked office, but a big desk blocked my view. Even if I could see one, I obviously didn’t have a key. Past a set of double glass doors was where half the books lived. The other half were behind me in the children’s section. It was darker in there, and I lingered by the doors for a while, taking in the space before me. Large, solid shelves filled the center, surrounded by tables and seating areas.  
  
  Computers.  
  
  Along the side wall were computers. I could send an email or a direct message.  
  
  It was even darker once I stepped all the way inside. Some table lamps were spread throughout the area and I reached under the shade of one to see if they were for decoration or if they actually worked. It clicked on with a warm glow. By the time I made it to the computers, I had turned on three lamps. They did little to dispel the darkness in such a large space, but they created a nice ambience. I laughed at myself. An ambience for what? A dance party? A candlelit dinner for one?  
  
  I sat down in front of a computer and powered it on. The first screen that lit up in front of me was a prompt to enter the library employee username and password. I groaned. Luck was not on my side tonight at all.  
  
  I heard a creaking noise above me and looked up. I don’t know what I thought I’d see, but there was nothing but darkness. The building was old and probably just settling in for the night. Or maybe it was the snow or wind hitting an upper window.  
  
  Another noise from above had me walking quickly to the hall. I jogged up the stairs and reached the front door. I pulled on the handles as hard as I could. The doors stayed firmly closed. I looked through the narrow side window. Cars drove by on the main avenue in front, but the sidewalks were empty. No one would hear me if I pounded on the glass. I knew this. I’d tried earlier.  
  
  I was fine. There was no one in the library but me. Who else would be dumb enough to get trapped in a library? All by themselves. With no way out. Distraction. I needed a distraction. I had nothing with me, though.  
  
  Books! This place was full of books. I would grab a book, find a faraway corner, and read until someone found me. Some might’ve even considered this scenario a dream come true. I could consider it that too. There was power in thoughts. This was my dream come true.  
  
  CHAPTER 2  
  
  I startled awake, and it took me several moments before I remembered where I was—trapped in a library. The book I had picked out to read rested open on my lap and my head had flopped onto the armrest of the chair. My neck screamed at me as I sat up. I rubbed at the knot there. A clock on the wall above the checkout desk read two fifteen.  
  
  Why wasn’t anyone worried about me? Searching for me? Maybe they were. In the wrong places. Had they all thought I went to the bonfire? That I decided to go home from there?  
  
  My parents were going to kill me. It was never easy talking them into letting me spend the weekend up at the cabin with the girls. I’d had to negotiate hard. My mom was a lawyer and way too good at making me see things her way, so I always went to my dad first. Plus, he worked from home (Creating the perfect tagline or jingle for your business. His words, not mine.) so he was the one available to take requests. Once I had him on my side we could normally convince my mom together. The negotiation had gone something like this:  
  
  “Dad, can I go up to Lisa’s cabin this weekend?”  
  
  He spun his desk chair around to face me. “Which one sounds better? ‘Tommy’s, because every day is a donut day.’”  
  
  “Ooh. Every day is a donut day. I haven’t had mine today yet.”  
  
  He held up his finger. “Or. ‘Tommy’s, they’re hot and fresh.’”  
  
  “Who’s hot and fresh? That sounds like you’re talking about a house full of frat boys or something.”  
  
  “You’re right. I need the word donuts in there, don’t I?” He spun back around in his chair and typed something in his computer.  
  
  “So? Can I go this weekend?”  
  
  “Go where?”  
  
  “Lisa’s cabin.”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  I wrapped my arms around him and laid my head on his shoulder. “Please. Her parents will be there, and I’ve done it before.”  
  
  “The whole weekend seems a bit long for you.”  
  
  I gave him a smile while putting on my best pleading face. “I’ll be fine. I promise. I won’t go out at all next weekend. I’ll stay in and help around the house.”  
  
  I could tell he was softening, but I hadn’t quite got him. “And I’ll hang out with Owen next time he’s in town.”  
  
  “You like to hang out with your brother, Autumn.”  
  
  I laughed. “Or do I?”  
  
  “Your mom’s firm has a work dinner in a couple of weeks. If you can handle a weekend at a cabin, you should be able to handle that.”  
  
  Nothing could have sounded worse to me. But that’s what compromise was—giving up something for another thing you wanted more. “Okay.”  
  
  “Okay,” he said.  
  
  “I can go?”  
  
  “I’ll have to double-check with your mom, but I’m sure it will be fine. Be safe. Take your phone. Your rules for the weekend: no drinking, no drugs, and call us every night.”  
  
  I kissed his cheek. “Those first two might be hard, but I can definitely handle the third.”  
  
  “Funny,” he said.  
  
  Call them every night. I hadn’t called them tonight. I wouldn’t call them tonight. That would put him in full dad mode. He’d call my friends. If they hadn’t understood why I wasn’t there before, they’d understand that somewhere along the way I’d gotten left behind. Someone would put two and two together. Sure, my parents would never let me leave the house after this again, but at least someone would find me.  
  
  My head ached, so I found my way to the drinking fountain outside the restroom. At least I had water. And nothing else. Nothing else. I shook my head. Those were the wrong thoughts. Someone was going to find me soon. If not tonight, then in the morning, when the library opened. I couldn’t remember what time the library opened on Saturday mornings. Ten? Eight more hours. Easy.  
  
  It was getting colder in the building. I found a thermostat box on the wall, but it was locked. This place sure seemed overzealous about their security.  
  
  In the distance I could barely make out a steady beat. There was music coming from somewhere. I ran to the front door and saw a group of people walking by on the sidewalk, laughing. They held a phone or iPod or something that was glowing in the darkness and playing music loud enough for me to hear. I banged on the glass and yelled. Not one of them turned or paused. Not one of them looked around like they even heard the hint of a noise. I banged again and yelled louder. Nothing.  
  
  “Listening to music too loud damages your hearing,” I said, resting my forehead against the glass. That’s when I saw a white paper below me, taped to the window. I peeled it off and read the front. The library will be closed starting Saturday, January 14, through Monday, January 16, in observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  
  
  Closed for the entire weekend? All three days? I’d be stuck here for three more days? No. I couldn’t do this. I couldn’t be in a huge building alone for three days. This was my worst nightmare.  
  
  My heart was beating so fast now it felt like my chest was being squeezed. My lungs weren’t expanding like they should. I yanked on the chains wrapped around the handles of the front door. Pulled them with all my might. “Let me out.”  
/>  
  A voice in the back of my head told me to calm down before I made this worse. Everything was fine. So I was stuck alone in a library, but I was safe. I could read and jog the stairs and stay busy. There were plenty of distractions here.  
  
  In my new quiet state, I heard something behind me. Footsteps on wood.  
  
  I whirled around, pressing my back to the door. That’s when I saw a shadowy figure on the stairs, a metal object glinting in his right hand. A knife. I wasn’t alone after all. And I definitely wasn’t safe.  
  
  CHAPTER 3  
  
  I stayed as flat against the wall as possible. Maybe the person wouldn’t see me. No, that was unlikely, considering that seconds before I had been banging on the wall and pulling the chains on the door. I might as well have been screaming, I’m trapped in a library all alone and am desperate to get out!  
  
  What was my plan now? I could run somewhere. Lock myself in a room. Though as far as I knew all the rooms that had locks were already locking me out. Just when I was about to run somewhere, anywhere, to find a weapon or somewhere to hide, he spoke.  
  
  “I’m not going to hurt you. I didn’t know anyone else was here.” He held up his hands and then, as if just now realizing he held a knife in one, he bent down and tucked it into his boot.  
  
  That didn’t make me feel much better. “What are you doing here?”  
  
  “Just needed a place to stay.”  
  
  Great. I was trapped in the library with a homeless guy? A homeless guy with a knife. My heart was in my throat.  
  
  I could tell he was trying to talk in a calm voice, but it came out scratchy. “Let’s sit somewhere and talk. I’m going to get my bag. I left it at the top of the stairs. And then I’m going to come down. Okay?” His hands were still raised in front of him, like that action should make me feel perfectly at ease. “Don’t call anyone until we talk.”  
  
  He thought I was going to call someone? If I had access to a phone, I wouldn’t be here. If I had access to any communication device—a bullhorn, a Morse code machine—do those machines have names?—I wouldn’t be here. But I wasn’t going to give away my hand. “Okay,” I said.  
The second he left me alone, I ran back down the stairs and past the glass doors. If he was armed, I wanted to be too.  
  
  I tucked myself behind a shelf in the back stacks. My breath was heavy and uneven and I couldn’t see a thing. I reached in front of me and grabbed the biggest book I could find. Worst-case scenario, I could hit him over the head with it.  
  
  “Hello?” he said from across the room.  
  
  “Don’t come any closer.”  
  
  “Where are you?”  
  
  “It doesn’t matter. You want to talk? Talk.” If I acted tough, maybe he’d think I was.  
  
  His voice became louder, clearer, so he must’ve been walking toward me. “There’s no reason to be scared of me.”  
  
  Why couldn’t he just stay across the room? We didn’t have to be within spitting distance to talk.  
  
  As I went to take a step back, my knee hit the shelf and one book and then another slid to the ground with a thud. I tightened my grip on the book I held and took off for the door. He was faster, though, and cut me off. I held the book over my head.  
  
  “Stop,” I said.  
  
  He took a step closer. I threw the book at him. He dodged it. I picked up another from a nearby shelf and threw it. It hit his shoulder.  
  
  He held his hands over his head. “Really?”  
  
  “I already called the cops,” I said.  
  
  He cussed.  
  
  I threw another book. “So just leave me alone. They’ll be here any second.”  
  
  We were closer now, one of the lamps I’d turned on earlier glowing to our right. That’s when I realized I recognized him.  
  
  I gasped. “Dax?”  
  
  “Do I know you?”  
  
  I must’ve still been in the shadows.  
  
  In relief, I lowered the book I held. Dax Miller wouldn’t have been my first choice of guys I’d want to be locked in a library with. In fact, if I could choose any guy from my high school, he probably would’ve been the last. His reputation wasn’t exactly stellar. There were stories about him. Lots of stories. But he wasn’t a stranger. And I wasn’t scared of him, so I immediately relaxed. “You go to my school.”  
  
  I wasn’t sure he knew me like most people at school did. I was on yearbook and was constantly snapping pictures so I was everywhere all the time. It was hard not to be well known when I had to be involved in so many events. But I’d never taken his picture. He wasn’t involved in anything. Well, at least not anything school-sponsored.  
  
  I took a small step forward, into the soft glow of lamplight, so he could see me more clearly.  
  
  Recognition crossed his face as he took me in, from my shoulder-length light-brown hair to my black wedge boots, then back up to my eyes. He didn’t seem to like what he saw. “Did you really call the cops?”  
  
  “No.” I ran my hands over my pockets. “I don’t have a phone.”  
  
  His eyes skimmed over my pockets as if he didn’t believe me, then he nodded once and headed toward the bag he’d dropped next to a chair.  
  
  I followed after him. “Do you?”  
  
  “Do I what?” He unzipped his bag.  
  
  “Have a phone.”  
  
  “No, I don’t.”  
  
  I stared at his bag, not sure he was telling the truth. “I just need to call my parents. They’re probably worried sick about me. Nobody knows where I am.” At least that’s what I was assuming since nobody had come back. “I would just use it to tell them where I am.”  
  
  He pulled a sleeping bag from his duffel and spread it on the floor. “I don’t have a phone.”  
  
  He brought a sleeping bag to the library? He wasn’t trapped here like me. He’d planned on staying all along? “But you’re not homeless,” I said.  
  
  “I never said I was.”  
  
  “Why are you here?” I asked.  
  
  He crawled into his sleeping bag and then reached up and turned out the light.  
  
  “Why were you worried about me calling the cops anyway? Are you in some kind of trouble?”  
  
  “Can you keep it down? I’m trying to sleep.”  
  
  If my whole body didn’t feel like Jell-O I might’ve kicked him, but instead I stumbled to a chair, sat down, and put my head on my knees. This shouldn’t have surprised me. Dax was secretive at school, a loner—why would I expect him to tell me his life story now?  
  
  It didn’t matter. It was fine. I’d be fine. At least I’d established Dax wasn’t trying to kill me or hurt me. Even though Dax was . . . well, Dax . . . it was better not being trapped here alone. And he had to have a phone in that big bag of his. He’d brought a sleeping bag, after all. When he went to sleep, I’d look through his stuff and find it. Now that I had a game plan I felt much better.  
  
  My chest slowly relaxed, relieving my burning lungs. This was the weirdest thing that had ever happened to me. It might even be a funny story later. Much later, when I was home with my parents and in my own bed with my nice warm comforter.  
  
  It was cold in here.  
  
  I stretched and then laid my head on the arm of the chair, pretending to go to sleep. I wasn’t sure if he could see me or if he was even watching, but I wanted him to think I was sleeping. Then, when I was sure he was out, I’d find his phone, call home, and this would all be over.  
  
  The clock on the wall read 3:20. My eyes ached from being awake for so long. I wondered what my friends were doing. What Jeff was doing. I’d known Jeff since freshman year, liked him since junior year, and now, in my senior year, had decided it was now or never. We’d both be going away to school the following year, and before we left I’d wanted to see if the tension that hummed beneath the surface whenever he was around would translate into a good relationship.  
  
  Had it only been that morning when he’d stopped me in the hall at school? My mind replayed the exchange.  
  
  “Autumn!”  
  
  I turned, camera in hand, and snapped his picture. He was easy to photograph, his features soft, open, friendly. His smile lit up his whole face, made his green eyes sparkle and his olive skin glow.  
  
  He caught up with me. “You might have more pictures of me than my parents.”  
  
  I probably did. “I can’t help that the camera loves you.”  
  
  “Is the camera asking me out on a date?”  
  
  “This camera goes nowhere without me.”  
  
  He raised his eyebrows like he wanted me to follow through with what I was implying. I wanted to ask him out. So bad. But if I had to be the one doing the asking, it wasn’t going to be in the middle of a crowded school hallway.  
  
  He went on. “So I was thinking about getting a group together to go to the library tonight and work on that history paper Mr. Garcia assigned. You in?”  
  
  I probably should’ve said no, but when offered extra time to hang out with Jeff, I always tried to make it work. “Yeah . . . I want to. I’ll have to talk to Lisa. We’re going up to the cabin with Morgan and Avi.”  
  
  “Let’s go before that, and then on your way up to the cabin we can stop at a campground and have a bonfire to celebrate finishing our papers.”  
  
  I laughed and pushed lightly on his shoulder. “You have this all planned out.”  
  
  “I do. So, you can work on the girls?”  
  
  “Yes. I’ll make it happen.”  
  
  “I knew you would. I’ll ask Dallin and the guys. See you tonight.”  
  
  And he saw me, before he left me locked in a library. If Jeff and I had been trapped here in this library instead of Dax and me . . . that would’ve been fun. He would’ve already figured out how to slide down the wooden stairs or race the book carts down the hall. Jeff was the exact opposite of Dax. Jeff smiled easily and joked often, and when he was around everyone was always laughing. Dax was dark and serious and seemed to weigh down any situation.  
  
  Jeff. Where was he? Had something bad happened? Did he think I ditched out on him at the bonfire? Why didn’t anyone realize I was gone? It didn’t matter. Soon I’d have a way to let everyone know where I was. Soon I’d have a phone.  
  
  CHAPTER 4  
  
  The scene around me was hazy, blurry. The sensation was familiar, but my mind wouldn�  
�t clarify what was going on. I was in a cold room with no windows or doors. It was like a big icebox. The second I thought it, the walls became slick with ice, the floor as well. Everything was covered in ice. My teeth began to chatter so hard they hurt. And then a musky scent enveloped me. Like one of Jeff’s hugs. And then Jeff was there, hugging me. The ice room disappeared, replaced by an endless green field. We stood in the middle clinging to each other.  
  
  “I liked you all along too,” he whispered. “I don’t know why it took us so long to admit it.”  
  
  “Because I was scared,” I said.  
  
  “Of what?”  
  
  What was I scared of? Letting someone close? Handing him the power to hurt me? Letting go of control? Possibilities don’t hurt as much as realities. Possibilities are exciting and endless. Realities are final. That had always held me back with Jeff, the thought that if I said how I felt and he didn’t feel the same way back, that would be it. There would be no more “what ifs,” no more “might bes,” no more dreaming.  
  
  Dreaming. That’s what this was. Just a dream. It was all just a dream. I needed to wake up now.  
  
  My eyes fluttered open. Sun shone through the upper windows, lighting the room. Disappointment weighed heavy on my chest. I may have been dreaming, but being trapped in the library hadn’t been a dream. I was still here. Still stuck.  
  
  With Dax. He was no longer lying on the floor. Where had he gone?  
  
  I sat up quickly and saw spots, the sleeping bag slipping off my shoulders as I steadied myself. His sleeping bag. He’d put his sleeping bag on me. I let it fall all the way to the floor and then stared at it lying there useless. I immediately missed its warmth.  
  
  It was eight o’clock and my stomach was tight from hunger. Nobody had come for me.  
  
  “Did the sleeping bag offend you?”  
  
  I let out a short scream. Dax sat in a chair across the room, his legs stretched out in front of him, crossed at the ankles. He wore jeans and a long-sleeved black shirt. His dark hair was slightly damp and was drying in a thick wave. He had a shadow of growth along his jaw. He held an open book, propped against his chest. The position he was sitting in—one shoulder down farther than the other, the shadows playing on his face creating shapes of darkness, the contrast of the red book against his black shirt . . . something made me wish I had my camera.  
  
  “You shouldn’t sneak up on a girl like that.”  
  
  “I didn’t move.”  
  
  “I know. It was a joke. I just didn’t see you at first. Thanks . . . for the sleeping bag.” A chill went through me, betraying the fact that I still needed it. “I . . . I have to go to the bathroom.”  
  
  “No need for a running commentary.”  
  
  “I was just telling you . . . right.” I stood, pulled down my left pant leg that had somehow ridden up during the night, and went back to the restroom. The toilet seat was cold, and the mirror proved I was in worse shape than I’d thought. Mascara was smudged down both sides of my face, making my hazel eyes look darker than normal. My hair, perfect waves the day before, was now a tangled mess, and three days without face wash was going to cause the world’s worst breakout. I turned on the water and did my best job to clean up the stray mascara and rinse my mouth out with water.  
  
  I finger-combed my hair to acceptable. There was still a kink in my neck from the awkward angle at which I’d slept, and my stomach was not going to be happy with me if I didn’t find food at some point today. I was angry with myself for falling asleep the night before instead of following through with the find-Dax’s-phone plan. Why was he making this so difficult? Why did he care if people knew we were here, anyway? Was he in some sort of trouble with the law . . . again? What had he done this time? I wasn’t even sure what he’d done the first time. Rumor had it that he’d beat up some guy. It wouldn’t surprise me if that rumor had been true.  
  
  I shivered again. I had been so thrilled with my outfit last night—a teal-green, flowy T-shirt, a cute tailored jacket, and a pair of jeans. But it had been warm in the library when we were working. Hot, even. For the hundredth time I wished I hadn’t taken my jacket off and shoved it in my bag. Wished I hadn’t put my bag in Jeff’s trunk. My bag. If I had that this whole thing would be over. Even without my phone I would’ve had everything I needed to last the weekend.  
  
  There had to be food in this place somewhere. The librarians had to eat lunch. A break room, maybe? On the third floor, I found it—a kitchen. There was not only a fridge but two vending machines—one for soda, one for snacks. They were kind of cruel really, the food on display without any way of getting it. I kicked the soda machine as I walked by, thought about reaching up and trying to grab one from the wide slot below, but quickly dismissed that thought. I’d once read a story online where a guy had to be rescued by the fire department because he got his arm stuck in a vending machine.  
  
  The fridge, unlike every other thing in the library, was not locked. It was a huge catering fridge. I’d almost forgotten that people had weddings and events at the library. It really was a big, gorgeous building that had become my prison. I crossed my fingers and opened one of the doors. On the shelf in the middle was the corner of a sheet cake. I wasn’t even sure why anyone would save it—that’s how small it was. But I would gratefully eat it later.  
  
  Behind the next silver fridge door was a clear Tupperware container of who-knew-what, but I could see the dark spots of mold clinging to the sides. Aside from that were two mystery paper bags. I pulled out the first bag with the words DON’T EAT MY FOOD written on the outside in Sharpie and looked inside—an apple and a yogurt, which was over a week expired. Considering the warning on the outside, I had hoped for something more steal-worthy. I took the apple and left the yogurt for later. In the other bag was more Tupperware and a can of soda. I gingerly lifted out the plastic bowl and slowly opened the lid. No mold, but I also couldn’t tell what it was. Pasta? Vegetables? Smelling it didn’t help. That could wait. I took the soda and left the rest.  
  
  In the cupboards I found some coffee cups and split the soda into two. The drawers were free of real utensils, but I found a plastic knife. It immediately broke when I tried to cut the apple in half with it. I’d just eat half and hope Dax wasn’t a germophobe.  
  
  I washed the apple for thirty seconds under warm water, then took a bite. Nothing had ever tasted better. I found some napkins tucked away in a drawer, and when I had eaten my share, I wrapped up the remaining half, picked up the cups, and went back down the stairs to face Dax again. If I could just get him to trust me, I wouldn’t need to sneak into his bag. He’d gladly hand over his phone to me. And he would. I was nice. People liked me. Dax would too.  
  
  CHAPTER 5  
  
  The main library was bright during the day; plenty of windows brought in slanting rays of sunshine. I carried the two mugs by their handles and held out one for him to take.  
  
  “You found coffee?”  
  
  “Coke close enough?”  
  
  He relieved me of one of the mugs and then I held out the apple wrapped in a napkin.  
  
  “What is it?” he asked without taking it.  
  
  “It’s half an apple.”  
  
  “You found half an apple?”  
  
  “I found a whole apple. I ate half of it. I can eat the whole thing if—”  
  
  He plucked it from my still outstretched hand.  
  
  “You’re welcome.”  
  
  He raised his glass to me and took a chug.  
  
  Not even a thank you. “One of the librarians must be an apple thief. The bag where I found it was owned by someone accustomed to having their food stolen. We have now added to the distrust.”  
  
  “I’m sure you’ll replace it later.”  
  
  “Maybe I will.” I made my way back to the chair I had slept in. His sleeping bag still sat on the floor. I stared at it for a long moment really not wanting to have to use it, but the goose bumps on my arms were multiplying by the second, so I swallowed my pride and picked it up. I draped the sleeping bag over my shoulders and sat down, holding my mug between two hands, wishing there was a hot drink insi  
de.  
  
  Once this soda was gone we could share a yogurt and some cake later and maybe a mystery dish. I could practically feel my stomach shrinking. Unless . . .  
  
  I looked at the big bag by his feet.  
  
  When I glanced up, he was staring at me. “What do you have in there?” I asked.  
  
  He must’ve known exactly what I had been staring at because he answered, “Not much.”  
  
  “Food? If you were planning to stay the whole weekend, you must’ve brought something to eat.”  
  
  “I wasn’t planning on staying here the whole weekend.”  
  
  “Where were you planning to stay? Why did you end up here?”  
  
  “I was planning to stay somewhere else.”  
  
  I waited for him to clarify, but that was the extent of his answer. “You’re not a big talker.”  
  
  “I talk when I have things to say.”  
  
  “Was that supposed to be insightful?”  
  
  “It wasn’t supposed to be anything but an answer.”  
  
  This was going to be a long weekend.  
  
  He closed the book and placed it on the table next to him, then leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. “Why are you here?”  
  
  I wanted to give him a snarky answer to compete with his responses. Something like, I wanted to eat stolen apples and read books all weekend. But I held my tongue. Maybe if he learned more about me, he’d realize I just wanted to leave. I wasn’t here to ruin whatever plan he’d had when coming here. “I had to pee.”  
  
  He leaned back and picked up his book, as though I really had given him my fake answer.  
  
  “We were here, working on that history project Mr. Garcia assigned. Did you do that yet?”  
  
  He must’ve realized I was actually answering his question, because instead of opening his book he placed it in his lap and shook his head no.  
  
  “Anyway, we were here, a bunch of us, and we stayed past closing to finish our papers. Everyone was leaving, getting in cars, and then I had to pee.”  
  
  “Your friends left you?” Now his expression changed. He was surprised.  
  
  “There were four cars. Lisa thought I was going with Jeff.”  
  
  “Your boyfriend?”

Done being his secret.

Done playing backup to my own twin sister.

The night after SATs ended, Luigi took my V-card while whispering Rosalia's name.

I discovered I was nothing more than his practice round—a substitute he used to perfect his technique before pursuing my twin sister.

His hockey teammates' group chat spelled it out in brutal detail: I was the expendable twin, the warm-up act for the main event.

For two years, I lived in the shadows of our ""relationship,"" watching him play knight in shining armor for Rosalia while treating me like I was invisible. I thought it was love. It was just humiliation.

That night, everything changed.

I deleted every trace of us, applied to a classified government program three thousand miles away, and walked out of my toxic family's house forever.

I'm dreaming hard, I've come so far, and now I believe in the woman I'm becoming.

Four years later, I'm Dr. Aurelia Cooper—brilliant, untouchable, golden.

But when my past comes crashing back into my new life, demanding I sacrifice everything I've built...

I'm not that broken girl anymore.

I'm done hiding in corners, accepting crumbs, playing second fiddle to anyone.

I'm going up, up, up—this is my moment and I'm glowing.

Some people don't deserve second chances.

Some bridges are meant to burn.

I chose myself once.

I'll choose myself every single time.

Watch me shine like I was born to be.





Chapter 1





The night after our SATs ended, Luigi took my V-card.





In the heat of passion, I couldn't help but let out a soft moan, only to hear him whisper ""Rosalia.""





But my name is Aurelia Cooper, and Rosalia is my twin sister.





I looked at Luigi uncertainly. ""Who did you just call?""





""Aurelia,"" Luigi said without missing a beat, leaning down to kiss my eyelids. ""Getting distracted right now? What, am I not doing this right?""





His movements became more aggressive, wiping away all my doubts.





Luigi was our school's star hockey player—not only skilled in technique but also blessed with seemingly endless stamina.





Wave after wave of sensation hit me as I weakly pushed against his chest.





""Stop... please...""





He pressed his lips to my ear, voice rough. ""Baby, let's try you on top.""





All night long, he had me every which way, flipping me around despite my tears and begging for breaks.





It wasn't until sunrise that he finally rolled off, satisfied, and headed to the shower.





I lay there completely wrecked, feeling like I'd been hit by a truck.





That's when his phone on the nightstand started going off like crazy.





Luigi's phone. I glanced over and saw a Snapchat notification pop up.





Yooo Luigi finally got his dick wet last night!





My stomach dropped. I couldn't help myself—I grabbed his phone and opened Snapchat.





When I scrolled through the group chat with his hockey teammates, I froze in shock.





In the middle of the night, Luigi had actually sent a photo of our bloodstained sheets to the team group chat!





Below the photo was a string of messages—





Tyler\_Hockey23: No fucking way bro, you actually banged Aurelia Cooper? Thought you were obsessed with her sister Rosalia?





JakeIce99: Dude you're missing the point. They're identical twins—same face, same body. Luigi's just using Aurelia for target practice, you know? Getting his technique down before he goes after Rosalia so he doesn't mess it up with his real crush.

Marcus\_Puck: Smart move. Rosalia's wifey material. Better to break in that virgin dick on the practice dummy first, then he'll know how to treat a queen right...

BradSticks: Bet Aurelia was tight as fuck though. Lucky bastard.

Tyler\_Hockey23: Think she knows she's just the warm-up act? ?

Each disgusting message felt like a knife to my chest, leaving me completely numb.

I'd imagined a million reasons why Luigi might want me, but never this.

Luigi wasn't just our hockey captain—he was Mr. Popular, friends with everyone. Meanwhile, I was the quiet nerd that teachers loved and most students ignored.

Our personalities were completely different who should never have crossed paths.

But during sophomore year, I had an accident during morning assembly—my period started unexpectedly and stained my pants. Luigi wrapped his hockey jersey around my waist.

After that, he started leaving coffee and pastries on my desk every morning, with sweet notes tucked in my textbooks.

Young love began blooming in my heart, but I never understood why Luigi would single me out.

I once asked him, ""Why me?""

He said, ""Because you're Aurelia Cooper.""

Teenage love—I had bet my entire seventeenth spring and eighteenth summer on it.

I'd snuck around with him, broken all the rules, given him my V-card, thinking it was the start of something real.

Turns out I was just his practice round.

I gripped the phone so hard my knuckles went white, but the physical pain was nothing compared to my shattered heart.

The shower turned off. I quickly closed the app and put his phone back.

The bathroom door opened and Luigi walked out with just a towel around his waist, water droplets running down his chest and abs.

""Morning, beautiful. You hungry?""

He sat on the bed edge and brushed hair from my face, his eyes lingering on the hickeys covering my neck and collarbone.

Looking at him, all I could think about was how he'd moaned ""Rosalia"" while he was inside me.

""I'm not hungry.""

Luigi noticed my red-rimmed eyes and pulled me against his chest.

""Shit, did I go too hard last night? Look, that was my first time too—I'm still learning the ropes. But hey, practice makes perfect, right? The more we do it, the better I'll get at making you feel good.""

His hands started wandering under my shirt, clearly ready for round two.

I couldn't stand him touching me anymore, knowing I was just his training wheels. I shoved his hands away.

""Don't. I'm sore.""

Luigi withdrew his hands, looking apologetic as he smoothed down my wrinkled shirt.

""You're right, I got carried away. Rest up—I'll grab us some breakfast and maybe take a cold shower while I'm at it.""

After getting dressed, he left the hotel room.

Staring at that crimson stain on the white sheets, I felt completely hollow inside.

For two years of secret dating, I'd hidden from teachers and classmates, bending over backward to make Luigi happy.

When he set his sights on Boston University, I made it my dream school too.

When he wanted to hold hands under our desks during class, I'd blush and intertwine our fingers while pretending to take notes.

When he wanted to make out behind the gym after study hall, I'd sneak out and let him kiss me breathless.

And when he said he wanted to celebrate the end of high school properly, I followed him to this hotel and gave him my V-card.

I thought our epic first love would last forever.

I never expected this betrayal coming.

Since he'd been playing me from day one, planning to trade up to Rosalia all along, I wouldn't follow behind him like a lost puppy either.

I got dressed and left the hotel, finding a pharmacy on the street corner where I awkwardly asked the pharmacist for Plan B.

She looked me up and down with obvious judgment before pulling the box from behind the counter.

""Honey, why didn't your boyfriend use protection? These pills aren't good for young women.""

My face burned with shame and embarrassment.

There had been condoms right there in the hotel nightstand.

Last night I'd tried to get Luigi to use one, but he'd bitten my neck and kept grinding against me，his eyes red with desire.

""Aurelia, come on, those things kill the mood. I'm dying here—just let me feel you, please? I swear I'll pull out.""

But my moment of compromise had led to this bitter pill.

I paid for the Plan B and thanked her.

""This is a one-time thing.""

I would never believe Luigi's bullshit again.

And I wouldn't let him hurt me anymore.

Chapter 2

I hadn't even stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard women behind me talking shit.

""Kids these days have zero self-respect.""

""She looks so innocent, but buying Plan B at eighteen? What a little slut.""

Their words felt like acid being poured over my skin, burning from my face straight down to my soul.

I practically ran to the bus stop, hands shaking as I dry-swallowed the white pill with bottled water.

The water went down wrong and I started choking, coughing so violently that tears poured down my cheeks. Everything hurt—my throat, my chest, my fucking heart.

""Aurelia!""

Luigi came sprinting toward me, panic written all over his face.

""What the hell? Why'd you bail from the hotel? I've been blowing up your phone—are you seriously gonna ghost me after what we did?""

He had the audacity to look wounded, like I was the one being shitty here.

I wanted to scream, to laugh, to do anything but stand there feeling like my chest was caving in.

""I was getting Plan B."" I waved the empty box at him.

His expression shifted, guilt flashing across his features for maybe half a second.

""Shit, you should've told me. I would've handled it. Had me thinking you were having second thoughts or something.""

I was too emotionally drained to fight about this. ""Whatever. It's done.""

Luigi must have noticed I looked like death because he reached for my hand. ""Look, I got carried away last night. Next time I'll be more careful, okay?""

""Tyler's throwing a graduation party at Copper & Flame. We should head over.""

I jerked my hand back like he'd burned me.

""We're not public yet, remember? Better if we show up separately. Don't want people talking.""

Luigi's whole body went rigid. After what felt like forever, he nodded stiffly.



""Yeah... yeah, good point. I'll grab a ride.""

I turned away and got on the first bus that pulled up, not trusting myself to look at him again.

Luigi had sworn we'd go official after graduation. But here we were, days later, and he was chatting up a storm in every group chat except mentioning anything about us.

The truth from his hockey team's messages had made everything crystal clear anyway.

This relationship was never meant to see the light of day.

By the time I made it to Copper & Flame, the private dining room was already packed with our entire graduating class.

And there was Rosalia, dolled up in some frilly pink dress, holding court in the center of the room while Luigi sat right beside her, literally hand-feeding her grapes.

I felt physically sick.

Some of the guys started razzing him: ""Bro, graduation's in like two days. You've been simping for our class princess forever—when you gonna grow some balls and ask her out? College is gonna be a whole different game, man!""

Luigi's obsession with Rosalia was common knowledge to everyone except, apparently, me.

While he was secretly screwing me, he was publicly playing her knight in shining armor—cleaning up after her, buying her lunch, fighting anyone who looked at her wrong.

Hell, he's the one who campaigned to get her voted class beauty in the first place.

We were identical twins. We had the same face, same body, same everything.

When I'd questioned him about it before, his bullshit excuse was:

""Babe, your sister looks just like you but she's fragile, you know? If I don't watch out for her, jealous people might target her. But you're different—you're strong. You have me.""

God, I'd actually bought that garbage. Thought he was being protective because he loved me so much.

Looking back, I wanted to punch my naive teenage self in the face.

I steeled myself and pushed through the door.

Luigi saw me walk in and didn't even have the decency to look guilty. Just kept playing the perfect gentleman with Rosalia.

She immediately bounced over to me, putting on her innocent little sister act.

""Aurelia! Oh my God, where were you last night? You didn't come home and Mom and Dad were freaking out!""

Every head in the room turned toward me, whispers starting immediately.

""Holy shit, staying out all night right after graduation? She definitely got laid.""

""I always thought Aurelia was this total nerd, but turns out she's a closet freak...""

Faced with their gossip, Rosalia looked secretly pleased.

I caught her expression and replied with ice in my voice, ""None of your business.""

I tried to find an empty seat away from the circus, but Rosalia grabbed my arm with fake sisterly concern.

""Don't be weird, sit with me!""

She yanked me toward her with way more force than necessary, and my shirt collar shifted, exposing every single hickey Luigi had sucked into my skin last night.

Rosalia gasped dramatically like she'd just discovered a crime scene. ""Aurelia, what are those marks?!""

The entire room went dead silent, then exploded with whispers.

""No fucking way, look at her neck!""

""Jesus Christ, someone went to town on her. How many are there?""

""Who knew the class nerd was such a slut? Bet she just grabbed some random guy for her graduation fuck.""

Humiliation burned through me as I frantically pulled my shirt back up. My eyes found Luigi automatically, desperately hoping for... what? Support? Acknowledgment?

He was meticulously peeling a fucking orange for Rosalia, acting like I didn't exist.

Something inside me finally snapped.

""It's nothing,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady. ""Got bit by a dog last night. Allergic reaction.""

A heartless, lying piece of shit dog.

Chapter 3

Everyone burst out laughing, making crude jokes about which random street guy the ""dog"" might have been.

Luigi's face went dark, and he slammed his hand on the table. ""Alright, everyone's here. Let's order.""

Once he spoke, nobody dared keep running their mouths. Tyler jumped in to smooth things over.

""He's right. After tonight we'll all be scattered across the country. Let's eat and catch up while we can.""

Everyone started sharing their summer plans—some heading out of state for work, others planning road trips or getting their licenses.

After dinner, we hit up the pool hall next door.

During a game, Rosalia got dared to let one of the guys lift her onto the pool table and spin her around.

The guys started hooting, and Rosalia looked shyly at Luigi. ""Luigi, could you do me a favor?""

Luigi's jaw clenched before he set down his cue stick. Without warning, he grabbed her waist and effortlessly lifted her onto the felt, spinning her in a slow circle.

""Hold on tight,"" he murmured, way too intimate for my comfort.

Rosalia giggled and grabbed his shoulders for support, practically melting into him.

The guys went wild: ""Damn, Luigi! Those hockey muscles aren't just for show!""

Watching this pathetic display, I dug my nails into my palms and forced myself to look away, trying to pretend I didn't exist.

Naturally, the next dare picked me. I had to either take three shots of tequila or make out with one of the guys for thirty seconds.

All the guys were grinning like wolves as I automatically looked toward Luigi.

He was still standing close to Rosalia, deliberately avoiding my eyes.

""I already did my good deed tonight. I'm out.""

His dismissal felt like being gutted with a rusty knife.

Fuck it.

I grabbed the first shot and threw it back, then the second, then the third. The alcohol burned like acid down my throat, and tears streamed down my face before I could stop them.

I barely made it to the bathroom before throwing up everything.

After splashing cold water on my face and rinsing out my mouth, I finally looked in the mirror.

Bloodshot eyes, smeared makeup, hair a disaster, hickeys still visible on my neck. I looked like I'd been hit by a truck.

I tried to fix myself up and forced a smile at my reflection.

""Aurelia, pain makes you stronger. You'll get through this...""

I couldn't go back in there. I texted Tyler that I was heading home and escaped.

On the bus, I opened my phone and scrolled through two years of messages with Luigi.

Aurelia, I'm so into you. Will you be my girlfriend?

Can't sleep again. All I can think about is you. Miss you so much.

There were hundreds of photos too—him showing off on his bike, scoring goals at hockey practice, selfies of us together at school.

I'd transferred all of this to every new phone, treasuring every word and image.

Now, with trembling fingers, I selected all 6.9GB of our history and hit delete.

Two years of love—erased.

Like it never happened. Like we never happened.

When I got home, I barely made it through the front door before Dad's hand connected with my face, sending me sprawling.

""You worthless little slut! Out all night, then coming home reeking of alcohol—have you lost your goddamn mind?""

Half my face exploded in pain. Through watery eyes, I saw Rosalia and Mom on the couch, watching my humiliation like it was entertainment.

""It was just a graduation party,"" I said, tasting blood. ""I barely drank anything and threw it up. Rosalia was there—she can tell you.""

Rosalia's eyes went wide with fake innocence. ""Well, there was a party, but Aurelia disappeared halfway through. I have no idea where she went after that.""

""Graduation was literally five days ago and she's already acting like a complete slut. Do you want the whole neighborhood thinking we raised a whore?""

Her words were gasoline on Dad's rage. Mom's face twisted with disgust.

Aurelia, we've told you a thousand times to follow your sister's example. If you had an ounce of Rosalia's class, your father wouldn't be losing his mind right now.""

I stayed on the floor, blood dripping from my split lip, my cheek on fire.

Looking at them cuddled together on the couch made me want to vomit again.

A travel brochure on the coffee table caught my eye: Post-Graduation Bali Family Trip for Three.

All three signatures were already there—Dad, Mom, Rosalia.

""You're taking her to Bali? Without me?""

Mom wouldn't meet my eyes. ""Rosalia won this in a contest at school. Only three spots available—naturally we're going with her.""

""You can stay home and think about your choices. Maybe next time there'll be room for you too.""

I laughed, bitter and broken. ""Next time? When the hell is next time?""

Rosalia had been born premature and sickly—doctors blamed me for ""stealing her nutrients"" in the womb. Ever since, Mom and Dad treated her like she was made of glass and me like I was some kind of parasite.

Growing up, every prize I won, every toy I loved, had to be handed over the second Rosalia showed interest.

Dinner was always ""let your sister eat first,"" birthday parties were ""we'll celebrate yours next weekend,"" Christmas presents were ""share with Rosalia, be a good big sister.""

""Next time"" never fucking came.

When Mom stayed silent, Dad raised his hand again.

""Keep running your mouth and see what happens! Get upstairs and don't come down until you've learned some respect!""

I dragged myself to my room, everything inside me screaming.

My phone buzzed with a text from my homeroom teacher.

Aurelia, come in tomorrow morning to go over your scores. We need to talk college applications.

Sure, I typed back, curling into a ball on my bed.

College was my ticket out of this nightmare. My chance to disappear.

The next morning I went straight to school and reviewed my test answers with Mr. Miller.

After calculating my projected scores, he lit up with pride.

""These are incredible, Aurelia. I remember you talking about Boston University—with numbers like these, you could get into any program you want.""

""I've got their admissions packet right here. Take it home and start planning your future.""

His enthusiasm made my chest tight with guilt.

I'd only wanted Boston University because of Luigi. Now I needed to think about saving myself.

""Actually, Mr. Miller, I want to apply to New Mexico Tech's government research program.""

I was going to leave this house I'd been trapped in for eighteen years, and leave Luigi too.

  Something You Should Know  
  
  While Pearl Tull was dying, a funny thought occurred to her. It twitched her lips and rustled her breath, and she felt her son lean forward from where he kept watch by her bed. “Get …” she told him. “You should have got …”  
  
  You should have got an extra mother, was what she meant to say, the way we started extra children after the first child fell so ill. Cody, that was; the older boy. Not Ezra here beside her bed but Cody the troublemaker—a difficult baby, born late in her life. They had decided on no more. Then he developed croup. This was in 1931, when croup was something serious. She’d been frantic. Over his crib she had draped a flannel sheet, and she set out skillets, saucepans, buckets full of water that she’d heated on the stove. She lifted the flannel sheet to catch the steam. The baby’s breathing was choked and rough, like something pulled through tightly packed gravel. His skin was blazing and his hair was plastered stiffly to his temples. Toward morning, he slept. Pearl’s head sagged in the rocking chair and she slept too, fingers still gripping the ivory metal crib rail. Beck was away on business—came home when the worst was over, Cody toddling around again with nothing more than a runny nose and a loose, unalarming cough that Beck didn’t even notice. “I want more children,” Pearl told him. He acted surprised, though pleased. He reminded her that she hadn’t felt she could face another delivery. But “I want some extra,” she said, for it had struck her during the croup: if Cody died, what would she have left? This little rented house, fixed up so carefully and pathetically; the nursery with its Mother Goose theme; and Beck, of course, but he was so busy with the Tanner Corporation, away from home more often than not, and even when home always fuming over business: who was on the rise and who was on the skids, who had spread damaging rumors behind his back, what chance he had of being let go now that times were so hard.  
  
  “I don’t know why I thought just one little boy would suffice,” said Pearl.  
  
  But it wasn’t as simple as she had supposed. The second child was Ezra, so sweet and clumsy it could break your heart. She was more endangered than ever. It would have been best to stop at Cody. She still hadn’t learned, though. After Ezra came Jenny, the girl—such fun to dress, to fix her hair in different styles. Girls were a kind of luxury, Pearl felt. But she couldn’t give Jenny up, either. What she had now was not one loss to fear but three. Still, she thought, it had seemed a good idea once upon a time: spare children, like spare tires, or those extra lisle stockings they used to package free with each pair.  
  
  “You should have arranged for a second-string mother, Ezra,” she said. Or she meant to say. “How shortsighted of you.” But evidently she failed to form the words, for she heard him sit back again without comment and turn a page of his magazine.  
  
  She had not seen Ezra clearly since the spring of ’75, four and a half years ago, when she first started losing her vision. She’d had a little trouble with blurring. She went to the doctor for glasses. It was arteries, he told her; something to do with her arteries. She was eighty-one years old, after all. But he was certain it could be treated. He sent her to a specialist, who sent her to someone else … well, to make a long story short, they found they couldn’t help her. Something had shriveled away behind her eyes. “I’m falling into disrepair,” she told the children. “I’ve outlived myself.” She gave a little laugh. To tell the truth, she hadn’t believed it. She had made the appropriate sounds of dismay, then acceptance, then plucky cheer; but inwardly, she’d determined not to allow it. She just wouldn’t hear of it, that was all. She had always been a strong-willed woman. Once, when Beck was away on business, she’d walked around with a broken arm for a day and a half till he could come stay with the babies. (It was just after one of his transfers. She was a stranger in town and had no one to turn to.) She didn’t even hold with aspirin; didn’t hold with depending, requesting. “The doctor says I’m going blind,” she told the children, but privately, she’d intended to do no such thing.  
  
  Yet every day, her sight had faded. The light, she felt, was somehow thinning and retreating. Her son Ezra, his calm face that she loved to linger on—he grew dim. Even in bright sunshine, now, she had difficulty making out his shape. She could barely discern his silhouette as he came near her—that large, sloping body settling into softness a bit in his middle age. She felt his flannel warmth when he sat next to her on the couch, describing what was on her TV or going through her drawer of snapshots the way she liked to have him do. “What’s that you’ve got, Ezra?” she would ask.  
  
  “It seems to be some people on a picnic,” he would say.  
  
  “Picnic? What kind of picnic?”  
  
  “White tablecloth in the grass. Wicker basket. Lady wearing a middy blouse.”  
  
  “Maybe that’s Aunt Bessie.”  
  
  “I’d recognize your Aunt Bessie, by now.”  
  
  “Or Cousin Elsa. She favored middy blouses, I recall.”  
  
  Ezra said, “I never knew you had a cousin.”  
  
  “Oh, I had cousins,” she said.  
  
  She tipped her head back and recollected cousins, aunts, uncles, a grandpa whose breath h  
ad smelled of mothballs. It was peculiar how her memory seemed to be going blind with the rest of her. She didn’t so much see their faces as hear their fluid voices, feel the crisp ruching of the ladies’ shirtwaists, smell their pomades and lavender water and the sharp-scented bottle of crystals that sickly Cousin Bertha had carried to ward off fainting spells.  
  
  “I had cousins aplenty,” she told Ezra.  
  
  They had thought she would be an old maid. They’d grown tactful—insultingly tactful. Talk of others’ weddings and confinements halted when Pearl stepped out on the porch. A college education was offered by Uncle Seward—at Meredith College, right there in Raleigh, so she wouldn’t have to leave home. No doubt he feared having to support her forever: a millstone, an orphaned spinster niece tying up his spare bedroom. But she told him she had no use for college. She felt that going to college would be an admission of defeat.  
  
  Oh, what was the trouble, exactly? She was not bad-looking. She was small and slender with fair skin and fair, piled hair, but the hair was growing dry as dust and the strain was beginning to show around the curled and mobile corners of her mouth. She’d had suitors in abundance, more than she could name; yet they never lasted, somehow. It seemed there was some magical word that everyone knew but Pearl—those streams of girls, years younger than she, effortlessly tumbling into marriage. Was she too serious? Should she unbend more? Lower herself to giggle like those mindless, silly Winston twins? Uncle Seward, you can tell me. But Uncle Seward just puffed on his pipe and suggested a secretarial course.  
  
  Then she met Beck Tull. She was thirty years old. He was twenty-four—a salesman with the Tanner Corporation, which sold its farm and garden equipment all over the eastern seaboard and where he would surely, surely rise, a smart young fellow like him. In those days, he was lean and rangy. His black hair waved extravagantly, and his eyes were a brilliant shade of blue that seemed not quite real. Some might say he was … well, a little extreme. Flamboyant. Not quite of Pearl’s class. And certainly too young for her. She knew there were some thoughts to that effect. But what did she care? She felt reckless and dashing, bursting with possibilities.  
  
  She met him at a church—at the Charity Baptist Church, which Pearl was only visiting because her girlfriend Emmaline was a member. Pearl was not a Baptist herself. She was Episcopalian, but truthfully not eyen that; she thought of herself as a nonbeliever. Still, when she went to the Baptist church and saw Beck Tull standing there, a stranger, glossily shaved and wearing a shiny blue suit, and he asked within two minutes if he might be allowed to call, she related it in some superstitious way to the church itself—as if Beck were her reward for attending with the Baptists. She did not dare stop attending. She became a member, to her family’s horror, and was married at Charity Baptist and went to one Baptist church or another, in one town or another, her entire married life, just so her reward would not be snatched away. (Didn’t that maybe, it occurred to her, imply some kind of faith after all?)  
  
  Courting her, he brought chocolates and flowers and then—more serious—pamphlets describing the products of the Tanner Corporation. He started telling her in detail about his work and his plans for advancement. He paid her compliments that made her uncomfortable till she could get off alone in her room and savor them. She was the most cultured and refined little lady that he had ever known, he said, and the best mannered, and the daintiest. He liked to place her hand to his, palm to palm, and marvel at its tiny size. Despite the reputation of salesmen, he was respectful to a fault and never grabbed at her the way some other men might.  
  
  Then he received his transfer, and after that things sped up so; for he wouldn’t hear of leaving her behind but must marry her immediately and take her with him. So they had their Baptist wedding—both of them out of breath, Pearl always pictured later—and spent their honeymoon moving to Newport News. She never even got to enjoy her new status among her girlfriends. She didn’t have time to show off a single one of her trousseau dresses, or to flash her two gold rings—the narrow wedding band and the engagement ring, set with a pearl, inscribed To a Pearl among Women. Everything seemed so unsatisfying.  
  
  They moved, and they moved again. For the first six years they had no children and the moves were fairly easy. She’d gaze at each new town with hopeful eyes and think: This may be where I’ll have my son. (For pregnancy, now, took on the luster that marriage had once had—it was the treasure that came so easily to everyone but her.) Then Cody was born, and moving seemed much harder. Children had a way of complicating things, she noticed. There were the doctors and the school transcripts and this, that, and the other. Meanwhile she looked around and saw that somehow, without her noticing, she’d been cut off from most of her relatives. Aunts and uncles had died while she’d been too far away to do more than send a sympathy note. The house where she was born was sold to a man from Michigan; cousins married strangers with last names she’d never heard of; even the street names were changed so she’d be lost if she ever went back. And it struck her once, in her forties, that she really had no notion what had become of that grandpa with the mothball breath. He couldn’t still be living, could he? Had he died and no one thought to inform her? Or maybe they’d sent the news to an out-of-date address, three or four years behind times. Or she might have heard but simply forgotten, in the rush of some transfer or other. Anything was possible.  
  
  Oh, those transfers. Always there was some incentive—a chance of promotion, or richer territory. But it seldom amounted to much. Was it Beck’s fault? He claimed it wasn’t, but she didn’t know; she really didn’t know. He claimed that he was haunted by ill-wishers. There were so many petty people in this world, he said. She pursed her lips and studied him. “Why do you look at me that way?” he asked. “What are you thinking? At least,” he said, “I provide for you. I’ve never let my family go hungry.” She admitted that, but still she felt a constant itch of anxiety. It seemed her forehead was always tight and puckered. This was not a person she could lean on, she felt—this slangy, loud-voiced salesman peering at his reflection with too much interest when he tied his tie in the mornings, combing his pompadour tall and damp and frilly and then replacing the comb in a shirt pocket full of pencils, pens, ruler, appointment book, and tire gauge, all bearing catchy printed slogans for various firms.  
  
  Over his beer in the evening (but he was not a drinking man; don’t get her wrong), Beck liked to sing and pull at his face. She didn’t know why beer made him tug his skin that way—work it around like a rubber mask, so by bedtime his cheeks had a stretched-out, slackened look. He sang “Nobody Knows the Trouble I’ve Seen”—his favorite song. Nobody knows but Jesus. She supposed it must be true. What were his private thoughts, inside his spreading face, under the crest of black hair? She didn’t have the faintest idea.  
  
  One Sunday night in 1944, he said he didn’t want to stay married. They were sending him to Norfolk, he said; but he thought it best if he went alone. Pearl felt she was sinking in at the center, like someone given a stomach punch. Yet part of her experienced an alert form of interest, as if this were happening in a story. “Why?” she asked him, calmly enough. He didn’t answer. “Beck? Why?” All he did was study his fists. He looked like a young and belligerent schoolboy waiting out a scolding. She made her voice even quieter. It was important to learn the reason. Wouldn’t he just tell her what it was? He’d told her, he said. She lowered herself, shaking, into the chair across from him. She looked at his left temple, in which a pulse ticked. He was just passing through some mood, was all. He would change his mind in the morning. “We’ll sleep on it,” she told him.  
  
  But he said, “It’s tonight I’m going.”  
  
  He went to the bedroom for his suitcase, and he took his other suit from the wardrobe. Meanwhile Pearl, desperate for time, asked couldn’t they talk this over? Think it through? No need to be hasty, was there? He crossed from bureau to bed, from wardrobe to bed, packing his belongings. There weren’t that many. He was done in twenty minutes. He drew in his breath and she thoug  
ht, Now he’ll tell me. But all he said was, “I’m not an irresponsible person. I do plan to send you money.”  
  
  “And the children,” she said, clutching new hope. “You’ll want to visit the children.”  
  
  (He would come with presents for them and she’d be the one to open the door—perfumed, in her Sunday dress, maybe wearing a bit of rouge. She’d always thought false color looked cheap, but she could have been wrong.)  
  
  Beck said, “No.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “I won’t be visiting the children.”  
  
  She sat down on the bed.  
  
  “I don’t understand you,” she said.  
  
  There ought to be a whole separate language, she thought, for words that are truer than other words—for perfect, absolute truth. It was the purest fact of her life: she did not understand him, and she never would.  
  
  At the time, they were living in Baltimore, in a row house on Calvert Street. The children were fourteen, eleven, and nine. They were old enough to suspect something wrong, if she didn’t take care. She took infinite care. The morning after Beck left she rose and dressed, piled her hair on her head the same as always, and cooked oatmeal for the children’s breakfast. Cody and Jenny ate without speaking; Ezra told a long, rambling dream. (He was the only one cheerful in the mornings.) There was some disappointment that the oatmeal lacked raisins. Nobody asked where Beck was. After all, he often left before they woke on a Monday. And there’d been times—many times—when he’d stayed away the whole week. It wasn’t so unusual.  
  
  When Friday night rolled around, she said he’d been delayed. He’d promised to take them to the Midget Circus, and she told them she would do it instead. Another week passed. She had no close friends, but if she met a chance acquaintance in the grocery store, she remarked that luckily, she wouldn’t have to use any meat points today. Her husband was away on business, she said. People nodded, showing no interest. He was almost always away on business. Few had ever met him.  
 Nights, especially Friday nights, she lay in bed in the dark and listened to the gritty click of heels on the sidewalk. Footsteps would come close and then pass. She would let out her breath. A new set of footsteps approached. Surely this was Beck. She knew how hesitantly he would let himself in, expecting the worst—his children’s tears, his wife’s reproaches. But instead, he’d find everything unchanged. The children would greet him offhandedly. Pearl would peck his cheek and ask if he’d had a good trip. Later, he would thank her for keeping his secret. He would be so easily readmitted, since only the two of them knew he’d left; outsiders would go on believing the Tulls were a happy family. Which they were, in fact. Oh, they’d always been so happy! They’d depended only on each other, because of moving around so much. It had made them very close. He’d be back.  
  
  Her Uncle Seward’s widow wrote to wish her a happy birthday. (Pearl had forgotten all about it.) Pearl responded immediately, thanking her. We celebrated at home, she wrote. Beck surprised me with the prettiest necklace … Say hello to the others, she added, and she pictured them all in her uncle’s parlor; she ached for them, but drew herself up and recalled how they had been so sure no man would marry her. She could never tell them what had happened.  
  
  Her old friend Emmaline stopped by, on her way to visit a sister in Philadelphia. Pearl said Beck was out of town; the two of them were in luck; they could talk girl-talk to their hearts’ content. She put Emmaline in the double bed with her, instead of in the guest room. They stayed awake half the night gossiping and giggling. Once Pearl almost set a hand on Emmaline’s arm and said, “Emmaline. Listen. I feel so horrible, Emmaline.” But fortunately, she caught herself. The moment passed. In the morning they overslept, and Pearl had to rush to get the children off to school; so there wasn’t much said. “We should do this more often,” Emmaline told her as she left, and Pearl said Beck would be sorry he had missed her. “You know he’s always liked you,” she said. Although actually, Beck used to claim that Emmaline reminded him of a woodchuck.  
  
  Easter came, and Jenny had a part in her school’s Easter pageant. When the day arrived and Beck was still not home, Jenny cried. Couldn’t he ever be home? It wasn’t his fault, Pearl told her. There was a war on, production speeded up; he couldn’t help it if his company needed him more now. They ought to be proud, she said. Jenny dried her tears and told everyone that her daddy had to help with the war effort. The war was so old by now, grinding on; no one was impressed. Still, it made Jenny feel better. Pearl went to the Easter pageant alone, wearing a rakish, visored hat that was patterned after the hats the WACs wore.  
  
  When Beck had been gone a month, he sent a note from Norfolk saying he was fine and hoped that she and the kids did not lack for anything. He enclosed a check for fifty dollars. It wasn’t nearly enough. Pearl spent a morning pacing the house. First she went over his note in her mind, picking apart his words for underlying meanings. But not much could underlie right good apartment with hotplate and sales manager seems to think well of me. Then she considered the money. Around lunchtime, she put on her coat and her WACs hat and walked around the corner to Sweeney Bros. Grocery and Fine Produce, where a CASHIER WANTED sign had been yellowing in the window for weeks. They were tickled to death to hire her. The younger Sweeney brother showed her how to work the cash register and said she could start the next morning. When her children came home from school that day, she told them she was taking a job to fill in time. She needed something to keep her busy, she said, now that they were growing up and going off on their own more.  
  
  Two months passed. Three months. Fifty dollars a month from Beck. When the second check arrived, no letter came with it. She tore the envelope apart, thinking it must have got stuck inside, but there wasn’t a word. With the third check, though, he wrote that he was moving to Cleveland, where the company planned to open a new branch. He said it was a good sign they’d decided on this transfer—or “invite,” he called it. He never called it a transfer; he called it an invite. An invite to this important expansion westward. He began the letter, Dear Pearl & kids, but Pearl didn’t show it to the children. She folded it neatly and put it with the first letter, in a hosiery box in her bureau, where even that meddlesome Cody wouldn’t think to look. In the fourth envelope, again, there was only a check. She saw that he was not in communication with her (was how she phrased it), but was merely touching base from time to time. Really, all he was doing was saying, Please find enclosed. It didn’t occur to her to answer him. Yet she went on saving his letters.  
  
  Sometimes she had strange thoughts that surprised her. For instance: At least I have more closet space now. And more drawer space.  
  
  At night she dreamed that Beck was new and wonderful again, someone she’d just become acquainted with. He gazed at her adoringly, overturning some unfamiliar center deep inside her. He helped her cross streets, climb steps. His hand cupped her elbow warmly or circled her waist or steadied the small of her back. She felt cherished. When she woke, her only thought was to sink back into her dream. She would keep her eyes shut. Superstitiously, she would play possum, not stirring, trying to persuade the dream that she was still asleep. But it never worked. Finally she would rise, whatever the hour, and go downstairs to make a pot of coffee. Standing at the kitchen window with her cup, watching the sky whiten over the rooftops, she would catch sight of her dark, transparent reflection—her small face and round chin that was taking on a dented look, these past few years; the worried tent of her colorless eyebrows; the pale frazzle of hair that failed to hide the crease across her forehead. That crease was not a wrinkle but a scar, the mark of a childhood accident. Oh, she was not so old! She was not so very old! But then she remembered the accident: she’d been trying to ride a cousin’s bicycle, the very first in the family. A “wheel” was what they called it. Trying to ride a wheel. And here it was 1944 and bicycles were everywhere, but so modernized they were hardly the same breed of beast. All three of her children knew how to ride and would, in fact, have had bikes of their own if not for the war. How had she come so far? She had just passed her fiftieth birthday. There was not a hope of Beck’s return. He’d found someone younger, someone glamorous and merry, still capable of bearing children. They were laughing at her—at how she’d always been an old maid, really, always an old maid at heart. How she flinched when he turned to her in the dark, still startled, after all these years, by the concreteness of him—by his scratchy whiskers, salty-smelling skin, weighty body. How she had to have things just perfect, the linens on labeled shelves in the cupboard and the shades pulled evenly in the windows. How she’d never learned to let go, to give in, to float on the current of a day, but must always fuss and pull at stray threads and straighten the corners of things; and worst of all, how she knew she did that, knew while she was doing it, but still could not stop herself.  
  
  He was never coming back.  
  
  It was time to tell the children. She was amazed, in fact, that she’d managed to keep it from them for so long. Had they always been this easy to fool? One good thing about telling them: they would rally around her better. She didn’t like to admit it but she was losing control of the boys. Instead of supporting her—taking out the garbage, helping her in various manly and protective ways—they seemed to be running wild; yes, even Ezra. They didn’t even do the chores they used to do, let alone take on new ones. Cody in fact was hardly ever home. Ezra was dreamy and forgetful and would like as not walk off in the middle of a task. When she told them what was what, she thought, they’d be horrified at how they’d let her down. They’d ask why she’d hidden it all this time, what she could have been thinking of.  
  
  Only she couldn’t tell them.  
  
  She planned how she would do it: she would gather them around her on the sofa, in the lamplight, some evening after supper. “Children. Dear ones,” she would say. “There’s something you should know.” But she wouldn’t be able to continue; she might cry. It was unthinkable to cry in front of the children. Or in front of anyone. Oh, she had  
her pride! She was not a tranquil woman; she often lost her temper, snapped, slapped the nearest cheek, said things she later regretted—but thank the Lord, she didn’t expose her tears. She didn’t allow any tears. She was Pearl Cody Tull, who’d ridden out of Raleigh triumphant with her new husband and never looked back. Even now, even standing at the kitchen window, all alone, watching her tense and aging face, she didn’t cry.  
  
  Every morning, then, she went off to Sweeney Bros. She continued to wear her hat, giving the impression that she had merely dropped in and was helping out as a favor, in a pinch. As each customer approached (generally someone she knew, at least by sight), she would give a firm nod and then squint, implying a smile. She rang up the purchases efficiently while a boy named Alexander bagged them. “Thank you, and good day,” she said at the end, with another shorthand smile. She liked to seem crisp and professional. When neighbors showed up, people she knew more closely, she felt she was dying inside but she didn’t lose her composure. With them she was even crisper. She had a little rhythm between the key stabbing and the sliding of groceries along the wooden counter; it kept her mind off things. If she allowed herself to think, she started worrying. Summer had arrived and her children were out of school all day. No telling what they might be up to.  
  
  At five-thirty she walked home, past crowds of youngsters playing hopscotch or huddled over marble games, past babies set to air in their carriages, women perched on their stoops fanning themselves in the heat. She’d climb her steps and be met at the door with bad news: “Jenny fell down the stairs today and bit her lower lip clean through and had to go to Mrs. Simmons’s house for ice and gauze.”  
  
  “Oh, Jenny, honey!”  
  
  It seemed they greeted her with disaster, saved up all their accidents especially for her. She’d want to take off her hat and shoes and fall back onto the sofa; but no, it was “The toilet’s stopped up,” and “I tore my pants,” and “Cody hit Ezra with the orange juice pitcher.”  
  
  “Can’t you just let me be?” she would ask. “Can’t you just give me a minute to myself?”  
  
  She’d make supper from tins she’d brought home, nothing fancy. She would listen to the radio while she washed dishes. Jenny was supposed to dry but was off playing tag with the boys. Stepping out the back door to heave her dishpan of water into the yard, Pearl paused to watch them—Cody and Jenny dark and quick, high-pitched, overcome with laughter; Ezra pale, a glimmer in the twilight, slower and more wandery in his movements. Sometimes there’d be neighbor children, too, but more often just the three of them. They stuck together, mostly.  
  
  She shampooed her hair and rinsed out a slip. Called to Cody to fetch the other two and come inside now.  
  
  Nights, she worked on the house. To look at her—an out-of-date kind of woman, frail boned, deep bosomed, as if those pout-fronted gowns of her girlhood had somehow formed her figure—you would never guess it, but Pearl was clever with tools. She patched a crack, glazed a window, replaced two basement stair treads. She mended a lamp switch and painted the kitchen cupboards. Even in the old days, she had done such things; Beck was not very handy. “This whole, entire house is resting on my shoulders,” she would tell him, and she meant it as an accusation; but the thought was also reassuring, in a way. She knew that she was competent. From early in their marriage, from the moment she had realized how often they would be moving, she had concentrated on making each house perfect—airtight and rustproof and waterproof. She dropped the effort of continually meeting new neighbors, and she stopped returning (freshly filled) the cake tins they brought over when she arrived. All she cared about was sealing up the house, as if for a hurricane. She woke nights wondering if the basement were dry, and went down barefoot to make sure. She couldn’t enjoy their Sunday outings because the house might have burned to the ground in her absence. (How vividly she could picture their return! There’d be an open space where the house used to stand, and a tattered hole for the basement.) Here in Baltimore, she gathered, she was thought to be unfriendly, even spooky—the witch of Calvert Street. What a notion! She’d known such witches in her childhood; she was nothing like them. All she wanted was to be allowed to get on with what mattered: calk the windows; weatherstrip the door. With tools she was her true self, capable and strong. She felt an indulgent kind of scorn for her children, who had not inherited her skill. Cody lacked the patience, Ezra was inept, Jenny too flighty. It was remarkable, Pearl thought, how people displayed their characters in every little thing they undertook.  
  
  Hammering down a loose floorboard, with a bristle of nails in her mouth, she would let time slip away from her. It would get to be ten-thirty or eleven. Her children would be standing in the doorway all sweaty and grass stained, blinking in the sudden brightness. “Heavens! Get to bed,” she told them. “I thought I called you in hours ago.” But a while after they left she’d start to feel deserted, even though they hadn’t been much company. She would lay aside her hammer and rise and walk the house, smoothing her skirt, absently touching her hair where it was falling out of its bun. Up the stairs to the hall, past the little room where Jenny slept, and into her own room, with its buckling cardboard wardrobe streaked to look like wood grain, the bare-topped bureau, the cavernous bed. Then out again and up more stairs to the boys’ room, a third-floor dormitory that smelled of heat. The trustful sound of her sons’ breathing made her envious. She turned and descended the stairs, all the way down to the kitchen. The back door stood open and the screen door fluttered with moths. Neighboring houses rang with someone’s laughter, a few cracked notes from a trumpet, an out-of-tune piano playing “Chattanooga Choo-Choo.” She closed the door and locked it and pulled down the paper shade. She climbed the stairs once more and took off her clothing, piece by piece, and put on her nightgown and went to bed.  
  
  She dreamed he wore that aftershave that he’d used when they were courting. She hadn’t smelled it in years, hadn’t given it a thought, but now it came back to her distinctly—something pungent, prickled with spice. A swaggery and self-vaunting scent, she had known even then; but catching wind of it, when he arrived on Uncle Seward’s front porch to pick her up, she had felt adventurous. She had flung the door open so widely that it banged against the wall, and he had laughed and said, “Well, now. Hey, now,” as she stood there, smiling out at him.  
  
  She had heard you could not dream a smell, or recall a smell in its absence; so when she woke she was convinced, for a moment, that Beck had let himself into the house and was seated on the edge of the bed, watching while she slept. But there was no one there.  
  
  Dance? Oh, I don’t think so, she said inside her head. I’m in charge of this whole affair, you see, and all I’d have to do is turn my back one instant for the party to go to pieces, just fall into little pieces. Whoever it was drew away. Ezra turned a page of his magazine. “Ezra,” she said. She felt him grow still. He had this habit—he had always had it—of becoming totally motionless when people spoke to him. It was endearing, but also in some ways a strain, for then whatever she said to him (“I feel a draft,” or “The paper boy is late again”) was bound to disappoint him, wasn’t it? How could she live up to Ezra’s expectations? She plucked at her quilt. “If I could just have some water,” she told him.  
  
  He poured it from the pitcher on the bureau. She heard no ice cubes clinking; they must have melted. Yet it seemed just minutes ago that he’d brought in a whole new supply. He raised her head, rested it on his shoulder, and tipped the glass to her lips. Yes, lukewarm—not that she minded. She drank gratefully, keeping her eyes closed. His shoulder felt steady and comforting. He laid her back down on the pillow.  
  
  “Dr. Vincent’s coming at ten,” he told her.  
  
  “What time is it now?”  
  
  “Eight-thirty.”  
  
  “Eight-thirty in the morning?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “Have you been here all night?” she asked.  
  
  “I slept a little.”  
  
  “Sleep now. I won’t be needing you.”  
  
  “Well, maybe  
after the doctor comes.”  
  
  It was important to Pearl that she deceive the doctor. She didn’t want to go to the hospital. Her illness was pneumonia, she was almost certain; she guessed it from a past experience. She recognized the way it settled into her back. If Dr. Vincent found out he would send her off to Union Memorial, tent her over with plastic. “Maybe you should cancel the doctor altogether,” she told Ezra. “I’m very much improved, I believe.”  
  
  “Let him decide that.”  
  
  “Well, I know how my own self feels, Ezra.”  
  
  “We won’t argue about it just now,” he said.  
  
  He could surprise you, Ezra could. He’d let a person walk all over him but then display, at odd moments, a deep and rock-hard stubbornness. She sighed and smoothed her quilt. It seemed he’d spilled some water on it.  
  
  She remembered when Ezra was a child, still in elementary school. “Mother,” he had said, “if it turned out that money grew on trees, just for one day and never again, would you let me stay home from school and pick it?”  
  
  “No,” she told him.  
  
  “Why not?”  
  
  “Your education is more important.”  
  
  “Other kids’ mothers would let them, I bet.”  
  
  “Other mothers don’t have plans for their children to amount to something.”  
  
  “But just for one day?”  
  
  “Pick it after school. Or before. Wake up extra early; set your alarm clock ahead an hour.”  
  
  “An hour!” he said. “One little hour, for something that happens only once in all the world.”  
  
  “Ezra, will you let it be? Must you keep at me this way? Why are you so obstinate?” Pearl had asked him.  
  
  It only now occurred to her, under her damp quilt, to wonder why she hadn’t said yes, he could stay home. If money decided to grow on trees one day, let him pick all he liked! she should have said. What difference would it have made?  
  
  Oh, she’d been an angry sort of mother. She’d been continually on edge; she’d felt too burdened, too much alone. And after Beck left, she’d been so preoccupied with paying the rent and juggling the budget and keeping those great, clod-footed children in new shoes. It was she who called the doctor at two a.m. when Jenny got appendicitis; it was she who marched downstairs with a baseball bat the night they heard that scary noise. She’d kept the furnace stoked with coal, confronted the neighborhood bully when Ezra got beaten up, hosed the roof during Mrs. Simmons’s chimney fire. And when Cody came home drunk from some girl’s birthday party, who had to deal with that? Pearl Tull, who’d never taken anything stronger than a glass of wine at Christmas. She sat him smartly in a kitchen chair, ignored his groans, leaned across the table to him—and couldn’t think of a thing to say.

NeverMore

For as long as Christina Ricci’ a forty five year old brown eyed, dark haired girl, Having the attitude to match. Her gothic charm, that was all about her, a charm that set her apart from other girls. But for as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her in the dark a place that was often familiar with her. As the wind blew through her dark hair blowing it in and around her face. While hearing the sounds of the Raven off in the distance beckoning to her saying to her for

NeverMore 

On this night never shall you find yourself desiring another for NeverMore no other shall know you. With Christina’ Often finding herself just wanting to be alone, finding herself often alone in the dark. Looking for more, more than she would often find in her life. For her fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her more times than she cared to admit to leaving her only to wanting more. Desiring More, more than they could offer her, leaving her with a burning desire to find more than they could give her. 

As Christina’ stood there her long dark hair covering over her eyes as the wind blew around her. Bringing with it the sounds of night, the sounds of the Raven’ as it beckoned for Christina’ on that foggy dark night. But as we get to know more of Christina’ never a girl to dress to impress, more than less finding herself in a pair of stone washed cut at the knee jeans and black tee. To match her personality, a girl who felt like she didn’t have to impress anyone. 

Just that if someone wanted her, then it was up to them to impress her, which would often leave her desiring more than they gave her. But as the sounds of the night grew quiet, another sound would then echo through the air. As a Raven then flew by her, crowing to her

“NeverMore”

Looking out into the night looking deep into a fog covered area revealing only shadows. But as Christina’ continued to look into the fog a man from deep within it would emerge, lurking from within its grasps, As he just stood there all dressed up in a long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee. Just standing there looking over to her. Just as the Raven then flew by Christina’ once again saying 

“NeverMore”

Just as the mysterious man then said to Christina’ 

“Why go ahead my dear, and you just say the words. And we shall go from there. Knowing how insane one could be knowing him”

For some words where never meant to be spoken but as we shall later see that some unsuspecting people would say the words 

“ Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

Just as he then vanished back into the foggy night, leaving Christina’ even more curious more than ever now. A curiosity that would leave her knowing more than she ever desired, Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair, Knowing that she had always been surrounded by Dark mysterious men for their presence alone always brought Christina’ wanting to know more. More than they could ever give her. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex, Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But as the night grew longer, as the fog became more deeper in closing her around in it. Our story begins here, for Legend has it that on that day in 1849’ when after five days that when they first found him. Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe’

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

“Who Killed Edgar Allan Poe’”

That they just might find out! But as Christina’ stood there hearing the sounds of darkness echo all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven’ off in the distance hearing it beckon for her

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her, With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there up underneath the street light. Standing there with a mysterious draw to him, with Christina’ now finding herself being drawn in by him. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven’ Could be heard as it flew by her once again as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina’ just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat. With other clothing to match, with Christina’ Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him. 

As he just stood there directly in front of her, hearing the sounds of the Raven’ calling out her name. As the darkness grew even more around her, But as quickly as he had come, He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina’ now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe’

As Christina’ could hear the Raven’ crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night. Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was now pounding for more, knowing that once with him Just wasn’t enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared. For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be NeverMore in this world, for the Raven had came for them he had came for them. Never more to know him, to know of his name. For insane to world he had become to a world in which wanted to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe, 

And that just wasn’t good enough for Christina’ as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it. Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! If He could make her feel that way one more time, Then death! Just Bring your ass on! For Christina’ was ready, ready for whatever happens even if it was for her to be

NeverMore

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! Hell no! For she wanted more than just dreams of him. She wanted to feel him again even if it was to be

NeverMore

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe?”

But Christina’ being a dark haired girl, Having that gothic charm about her leaving others wanting to know more about her. But never to please her the way that she wanted them to. But Christina’ Knew that she was going to get what she wanted. With her even knowing what happened five nights ago, though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone. But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled. By the one who could have her being NeverMore! As the Raven flew by saying 

NeverMore

But for now shall we go back to five nights prior, Five nights ago when it all started. But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina’ was looking forward to, But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied.

As she lay there thinking to herself, Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her, After a good night of fucking for him Just wasn’t enough for her. Guessing that’s why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could. Always finding them gone by morning gone before waking up, as she lay there looking up to the ceiling saying 

“I swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!”

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it’s like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It’s like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I’m just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass on the way out. They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn’t be God that answered her, But someone much darker. To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina’ would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn’t much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again maybe another week or two. Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in.

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there with her nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina’ stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself, Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl, Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I’m going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn’t so bad. It gives her the freedom to be free, To be her

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans. Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes, A pair a converses, And with that, To venture into whatever finds her. And find her something would, Something that she could have never imagined that would be. But imagined is beyond belief, This was beyond death itself. 

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn’t get her feel either, Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead?

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy’s apartment. Jimmy’ was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends. But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit, Some Very dark shit. That often had Christina’ questioning at times. As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened but as usual the dicks just didn’t know what ass to look or go up. 

Only knowing the hookers ass around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn’t know dick. As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead. As Christina’ then thought to herself 

“Well no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!”

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy’ sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn’t going to find out. Who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina’ then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy’s body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor. But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall in blood was the words written 

NeverMore

Just then as a Raven’ flew into an open window landing on it’s bottom frame as it the crowed 

“NeverMore”

Like she said, Jimmy’ was into some serious, dark shit. Walking on past making her way outside, where she would then run into another guy. Someone that Christina’ didn’t mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny’ a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket. Sunny outside or not, he was wearing that jacket. With his eyes and hair to match he was someone that Christina’ would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina’ then thought to her herself, at least Johnny’ knew how to please someone. But as Christina’ then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy’ With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

“Look! I don’t know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!” 

With Christina’ then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

“Look. I know! Well sorta knew Jimmy’ much more she should have known about him. And that he wasn’t into drugs Johnny’ he was into some serious dark shit! But not drugs, but you don’t have to be so snarky you know”

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

“Look! The other night me and Jimmy and four other people, who I didn’t know who they were, well we went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn’t kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!”

With Christina’ then replying 

“Something else! What do you mean something else!”

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As Christina’ then looked back at him curious like then saying 

“What! What do you mean? Who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina’ saying to her 

“Yeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!”

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

“I mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!”

But as Christina’ then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven’ saying to her

NeverMore 

As Christina’ stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. Just as a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar. Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

As the Raven flew through the night, But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang’ wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang’ then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

“For insane I have became, Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe”

With Chang’ now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang’

“So a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be! Or how insane do you wish to be”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Who are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?”

As the figure then said to Chang’ 

“Is it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know”

As Chang’ then replied back saying to him

“What do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!”

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang’ saying to him

“Oh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!”

As Chang’ then said back to him

“Tell me what!”

As the figure then replied back to Chang’ saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang’ letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang’ was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina’ not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did. For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would then suddenly come into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall in blood behind them were the words 

NeverMore

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed. Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown without being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina’ being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird.

Just as a Raven’ then flew by them crowing to them

NeverMore

But as Christina’ soon found herself on the way scene as Christina’ continued to make her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head. For it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As he would find out how insane the one that he summoned had became. As the world would continue to want to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe,

As Christina’ stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven’ Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowing 

“NeverMore”

Standing there now looking at the Raven’ just as it then flew off into the day. Leaving the dead person to be, leaving him to a world that wished to know. But only leaving them to knowing 

NeverMore 

And Leaving Christina’ now with more questions than answers, As Christina’ then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city’s landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

“NeverMore!”

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny’! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

“The four other people that was with you and Jimmy’ were they the ones murdered the last four nights”

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

“Look! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots”! 

With Christina’ just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

“ Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!”

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina’ would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city’s night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven’ then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

“NeverMore!”

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

“I have became insane! to a world that wants to know!” More than they should know!”

“But For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me”

“Do you want to know? My love!

As Christina’ then said back to him

“Do I want to know what”?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40’ with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina’ more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don’t want to know?

With her again asking him

“know what?”

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

“To know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know”

And desired to know more Christina’ did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina’ was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina’s body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

“To know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.”

The desire was here, Christina’ thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

“ I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina’ was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina’ heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina’ could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

“Tonight my love I will know you as you desire!”

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina’ body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina’s cheek, As Christina’ lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding me against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants! Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

feeling his sweat as he then placed her hands around his back moving them up behind his head. 

Christina’ could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci’ saying

“Dam! I would give up hell just to be in her!” 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina’ had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go! 

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina’ asking her

“Do you want to know?”

With Christina’ now looking at him saying 

“Know what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

“Who killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

With Christina’ then asking 

“Who!”

As he then just laughed as he said

“I did!

“I killed Edgar Allan Poe!”

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

“NeverMore!” 

Just before it flew off into the night!

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina’ even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore

Leaving Christina Ricci’ then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

1msw292,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1msw292/met_with_my_ex_for_coffee_whats_his_motive/,"Met with my ex for coffee, what’s his motive?","My ex boyfriend and I had a mutual breakup, about 5 months ago. Mutual, but I pushed for it. Very amicable too. No hate, no resentment, and we both have acknowledged that since. I reached out and told him that miss him, and he met me with the same energy, said something sentimental and offered to meet me. We planned this meeting for over a week, and we met at our old coffee spot, next to the apartment complex we used to live in, which is a location he chose.

When we sat down, he expected me to have a question for him, but i didn't have one. He said ""but you said you missed me?"". We talked, caught up, flirted, and reminisced---and at the very end of the meeting, he told me we can't be close friends because he's seeing someone new. it caught me off guard. I had suspected that he was sleeping with someone at some point after our breakup, but not currently seeing someone.

my immediate reaction was, ""does she know you're seeing me today?"", and he said no, because he doesn't know exactly how she'd feel. 
He then said we will always be friends, and that if i ever need a friend or to talk to someone I can always reach out, ""even if I'm not your first choice."" He told me to tell my parents he said hi. 

Him seeing someone new, of course bothers me, but I've also been in a thing with someone (not a relationship) for a while too---so I cannot be that bothered. We promised each other that we wouldn't tell each other when we started to date someone new. It was the end of our coffee, and it wasn't necessary to mention, so why bring it up? I didn't even tell him I'm having a thing with someone either. I don't think he was trying to make me jealous necessarily, because it wasn't a ""f you"" kind of statement, it was more like a ""just to let you know"". 

Why wouldn't he tell me about him seeing someone, the moment I texted him I missed him? Why would he respond emotionally? Why would he offer to meet me? Our coffee meeting literally felt like a date, right up until the end. Why wouldn't he tell the person he is seeing, about us meeting? I personally think he expected me to outright say that I wanted him back, but was surprised when I just wanted to catch up. So thats when we just decided to talk and catch up.

Our meeting was very flirty, familiar, and we shared everything new with each other. I touched his hand (thought he was single), and he didn't push it away, or mention seeing someone then. He told me how he spotted me at a local bar a couple of weeks ago, and said he didn't say hi because I was in the zone. He never used to go to bars, especially not the ones i like. I asked him when this was, and he PULLED out his damn calendar 😭

Nonetheless, I was and am interested in rekindling things, especially since our breakup wasn't a deal breaker kind of thing. I'm sure he could get a sense of that, so why did he even meet with me? ",2,1755449625.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

But I've prayed before and I do trust that God's protecting me. So, here we go. I feel like I just can't do this alone anymore. I like, I try, and I know all I need is God and I do know that and I do acknowledge that and I also do feel like it, but right now I feel like I'm in a season where I'm literally not do this alone, because I feel like I have a relationship with God where the only person that I literally trust with everything is God. Sure, I'll tell people things, but I only trust God if I literally am scared, emotionally or physically, or I wanna like, feel comfort, I immediately go to God because I only trust Him. But like, the Bible does encourage  fellowship and I feel like I need fellowship and I just wanna find a church community that have the people truly rooted in Christ, both inside and out. That they bear fruit of the Spirit, that they're not just Christians by claim, but also by action and heart. And I just feel like I've been praying for God to send me Christian friends that I can like, meet up and go grab coffee while reading the Bible together. Like, I feel like I need that one-on-one social gathering, not just like online. And I'm just like hoping that maybe I will find some people here around my age that live in the same area as me that are willing to meet up. If there are any church that check every box that I'm looking for in a church, I would love to be invited to a church. And a church that I've like, I don't know if I should mention this, but also a church that mainly speaks English. Because English is, even though it's not my native language, it's technically my main language and the language that I know best. So I feel like that is important, I guess. And I'm 18 years old, and God. And I live in Cape Town, South Africa.

1msvxau,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1msvxau/should_you_upgrade_to_the_best_pour_over_coffee/,Should You Upgrade to the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Bodum,"Brew enthusiasts like me are always on the hunt for that perfect cup of coffee, and curiosity recently led me to the Bodum 11571-109US. Known for its sleek design and innovative functionality, this manual pour-over coffee maker has been hailed as a game-changer by many. Naturally, I had to try it myself to see if it lived up to the hype. After a few weeks of daily use, I’ve formed a pretty solid opinion about this elegant brewing gadget. Let me walk you through my experience.

**Aesthetic Appeal Meets Practical Design**  
One of the first things I noticed was the stunning visual appeal of this coffee maker. Crafted with high-heat borosilicate glass, it has a minimalistic yet sophisticated vibe that blends effortlessly into any kitchen decor. The cork grip not only adds a pop of rustic charm but is also practical—it stays cool to the touch while pouring, making my brewing sessions safer and mess-free. At only 1.21 pounds, it’s also lightweight and easy to handle. I didn’t need to reserve any extra counter space since its dimensions of 5.63""x8""x6.5"" made it compact enough to fit comfortably in my cabinets.

**Ease of Use for a Quick Brew**  
I’ve used several coffee makers in the past, and the manual approach of this product surprised me with how intuitive it was. Brewing with it is remarkably simple. Adding coarse coffee grounds to the reusable stainless steel filter, pouring in a little hot water in a circular motion to saturate the grounds, and then finishing with the rest of the water took no more than 4-5 minutes. The manual process felt very hands-on, almost meditative, and to my delight, I found myself enjoying the morning ritual much more than just pressing a button.

[Check Bodum 11571-109US price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b07kqvw6rr/)

**Taste Quality Designed for Coffee Purists**  
The flavor payoff from this pour-over coffee maker is where it truly shines. Its stainless steel mesh filter ensures that the natural oils and subtle flavor notes of the coffee aren’t absorbed like they would be with a paper filter. This allowed the full-bodied richness of my grounds to come through in every cup. Every sip made me question why I ever bothered with traditional coffee machines that often leave a slightly artificial aftertaste. While the carafe holds 34 ounces (about eight small 4 oz cups), this was perfect for family brunches or when I wanted to indulge in multiple rounds solo while enjoying a leisurely weekend morning.

**Winning Points**  
Here’s what stood out to me after frequent use:
- Beautiful cork detailing that is both stylish and functional.
- The borosilicate glass is durable and heat-resistant, ideal for everyday use.
- The reusable stainless steel filter eliminates the need for paper filters, making it eco-friendly.
- Capable of brewing multiple servings, perfect for both solo and group settings.
- Dishwasher-safe parts made cleaning an absolute breeze.

**Areas for Improvement**  
No product is without its challenges, and this coffee maker has a few quirks worth considering.  
- The carafe doesn’t have double walls, so the coffee cools down relatively quickly. I often found myself reheating it if I let it sit too long.  
- While the filter is effective, very finely ground coffee tends to seep through—stick to coarser grounds for the best experience.  
- The cork band is not dishwasher-safe, meaning it needs to be removed and hand-washed separately. This added a small extra step during cleanup.

**Competing Products**  
There are a few well-established peers in the manual pour-over market like the Hario V60 and the Chemex. Chemex, for instance, has an edge with its thicker glass and iconic design, but it requires paper filters, which adds ongoing costs and creates waste. Hario V60 offers better heat retention through its ceramic body, but its steeper learning curve might not appeal to beginners. Compared to both, the Bodum pour-over feels like a balanced choice—it’s beginner-friendly, has a reusable filter, and offers stellar flavor extraction. While it might not retain heat as well as the ceramic Hario, its lightweight and compact nature won me over for everyday use.

**Smart Spending**  
When evaluating whether a product is worth its price, I always consider longevity, utility, and overall satisfaction. The reusable filter alone makes it a cost-effective option in the long run, saving me the expense of constantly buying paper filters. Its ability to produce a barista-level coffee experience at home left me feeling it was absolutely a smart upgrade to my kitchen equipment. If you’re someone who prioritizes flavor, simplicity, and eco-conscious design, this pour-over coffee maker might just be your ideal brewing companion.

1msvuk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MOVA_USA/comments/1msvuk6/still_not_perfect_but_my_dog_and_i_think_the_mova/,"Still Not Perfect, but My Dog and I Think the MOVA V50 Is Close: My Thoughts/semi-review After 10,000 ft² (~1,000 m²) Cleaned","If you’ve got a fluffy friend, you know the unspoken Faustian bargain: unconditional love in exchange for a home permanently blanketed in fur—and a daily lake of drool waiting in the places where you least expect, just for you to step in. Most robot vacuums promise barefoot-friendly floors, but I’ve been burned before. My old budget bot had to run twice a day just to keep up with my long-haired corgi, or its dustbin would clog with fur. So when MOVA sent me their new V50 Ultra as part of their Reddit collaboration program, I wasn’t expecting it to be much better. I did not receive any money from this collaboration.

# Receiving the MOVA V50 Ultra: 

I received the V50 Ultra in a fairly nondescript cardboard box, sealed with MOVA-branded tape. Inside was the main retail box, also covered in MOVA logos. It’s on the heavier side, so handle with care—I found it a bit awkward to lift, even with the cut-out handles, as the box is quite wide. Sliding the main box out of the outer protective box took a bit of effort.

[A photo of the MOVA V50 Ultra's main box](https://preview.redd.it/suyrslcv85if1.png?width=4284&format=png&auto=webp&s=038586383a6a0eec69f580eafb48d119b0f70ede)

On the box, MOVA proudly lists all the bells and whistles:

* **DuoSolution tank**: You can add a pet odor-neutralizing solution to tackle that dreaded pet funk, along with a general floor detergent in a separate, larger tank. The detergent mixes with water as it fills the robot’s internal tank for regular mopping, while the deodorizing solution is used specifically to clean the mops.
* **StepMaster climbing**: can clear small steps up to 6cm total—specifically, 4.2cm followed by 1.8cm.
* **24,000Pa suction**: a wildly high number that beats the Dreame X50 on paper, putting it on par with even some cordless vacuum cleaners.
* **JetSpray DryBoard**: uses 20 high-pressure jets to clean the mops and washboard.
* **Edge cleaning**: side brush and mop can extend to reach corners and along walls.
* **FlexiPress mop**: tilts up to 5° for more even pressure on uneven floors, spins at up to 260 RPM with 8N of pressure.
* **80°C (176°F) mop washing**: hot water mop rinse to lift grease from the mops.
* **OmniDry system**: dries the mops in as little as an hour, .and fully dries the dustbin and dustbag in about three

But as you might already know, **I don’t care much for spec sheets alone**. I care about what actually adds value to autonomy or cleaning performance in the real world. So here are my surface-level first impressions—and a closer look at whether these features actually live up to the claims. 

**Unpacking it:**

The packaging was solid and well-protected. Aside from some minor dents and cosmetic scuffs on the plain outer box (doing its job, really), everything inside arrived intact. The double-boxed design used thick, durable cardboard throughout. No complaints there—though I do wish the unboxing experience felt a bit more premium or luxurious for a flagship device.

[The accessory kit is packed inside the main box and is the first thing you see when opening the box](https://preview.redd.it/9gnpp29795if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bab79a92551eb02606185ce5961203f94a1b0cbc)

Right at the top of the main box is the oversized accessory kit—and it’s *stacked*. You get:

* **Twelve extra mops** (enough for six replacements)
* **1L of MOVA floor detergent** (the detergent tank holds up to 400mL, so this covers over two full refills)
* **200mL pet odor-neutralizing solution** (exactly one full fill of the B tank)
* **Three spare dust bags**
* **Three extra filters** (rated for 450 vacuuming hours total)
* **Two side brush replacements** (designed for easy swapping every 200 hours with a screwdriver)
* **A spare pair of double anti-tangle main brushes** (rated for 300 vacuuming hours; note: replacing them takes a surprising amount of force to pull out and snap back in, with careful alignment of the hexagonal rods and brush holes)

[Look at all the accessories!](https://preview.redd.it/infdrbys95if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21979f38d4d280cae296152779eae2d0be2264e0)

Frankly, this is one of the most generous accessory kits I’ve seen bundled with any robot vacuum—especially in this price range. Most brands don’t even include a single bottle of detergent, even after charging this much. 

[From top to bottom, the base station's power cable bundled up, the two FlexiPress mop pad holders with mop pads attached, and the base station's removable ramp](https://preview.redd.it/321r2cr7k5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=02533e82cfbcb377e96123e98af3a32f15afa973)

Beneath the accessory kit is a smaller side box on the left, containing the dock’s detachable ramp (handy for cleaning), the power cable, and the robot’s mop pads pre-attached to the magnetic FlexiPress holders. Once that’s out of the way, you’ll see the main robot box with a sturdy built-in plastic handle for easy lifting. Under that, the dock itself is neatly packed inside a protective plastic. 

**Build quality:** 

[The MOVA V50 Ultra is in its base station on the left of my old robot vacuum in its dock. The MOVA's base station is noticeably shorter.](https://preview.redd.it/f88vnh2gk5if1.jpg?width=5160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a16bdebf3c7157998f1eb5c81c3432b375e21a0a)

The MOVA V50 Ultra Complete and its base station feel impressively well-built. While mostly plastic, the construction is sturdy and durable. The magnetic top cover snaps on securely—no issues with weak magnets or misalignment. The brushes also feel solid and well-made. I’m not a fan of the glossy plastic finish, though; it’s a magnet for fingerprints and, unsurprisingly, fur. The dustbin is made from hard plastic and took a hit when I accidentally dropped it, leaving a scuffed white mark. So yes, it’s tough, but not invincible.

**Setting up the robot:**

To test ease of use, I handed the setup over to the most technologically challenged family member—and they had no trouble. Pairing the robot was simple, and mapping was surprisingly quick. Impressively, the robot managed to escape my shower’s 3cm threshold using its secondary wheels, part of MOVA’s so-called StepMaster system. Older robots would have gotten stuck in there during mapping. I actually expected to configure this manually in the app, but the robot automatically recognized the threshold as passable and added it to the map. Nice.

It also recognized that my kitchen cabinets had just enough clearance for it to duck under by retracting its LIDAR, and marked the area as low-clearance. That said, it struggled with the diagonal section of my kitchen counter, which I had to manually fix. It also mislabeled my bedroom as a kitchen and didn’t quite get the orientation of the wooden floorboards right—but otherwise, room partitioning and labeling were fairly accurate.

My family member noted a bit of a learning curve when customizing room partitions, but once they figured it out, setup was smooth. I do wish there were an option to label a space as an “entryway” in the rooms you can choose from, but fortunately, you can rename any room however you like.

As for ultrasonic carpet detection, it correctly identified the office rug and most of the carpet under the coffee table, though the detection was patchy and required me to manually define that area. If you have fully carpeted rooms, you can mark them as such—but it takes a bit of digging through the settings.

[The DuoSolution Tank and the pet odor solution is pictured together with the B tank made to be filled with the pet odor solution](https://preview.redd.it/qkxsswe8c5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f2ecfb097b13b8eb83ec26e376f05ce03e408bc)

After filling the DuoSolution tank with both the general detergent and the pet odor-neutralizing solution, and topping up the clean water tank, it was time to let the robot earn its keep. I didn’t actually have high hopes—so I ran my old robot a day prior to vacuum and mop first, just in case.

I then ran the V50 Ultra in CleanGenius vacuum mode, followed by deep cleaning mop mode. I wanted to see if it was a CleanGenius… or a CleanDummy.

To my surprise, the kitchen—normally coated in a fine layer of grease that required two passes from my old robot—was squeaky clean in just one. The wooden floors were also noticeably softer and smoother to walk on after just a single pass.

When I pulled out the dirty water tank, the results were obvious: not only was the water noticeably darker than what my old robot usually picked up, but there was a visible layer of grease floating on top. The tank was greasy enough that I had to wash it with a sponge and dish soap—suggesting the hot water mop washing was *actually doing its job* and lifting grease off the mops effectively.

I attribute this improved mopping performance to a few things. 

* **More pressure for a deeper scrub**: the V50 Ultra mops with 8N of downward pressure, which really helps on hard floors. 
* **The mops hug the floor better**: The FlexiPress system also keeps mop pressure more evenly applied across uneven surfaces, thanks to its ability to tilt up to 5 degrees and adjust vertically by a few millimeters—something my old robot always struggled with. 
* **Automatic detergent mixing**: The robot also automatically mixes detergent with water before mopping, so it’s not just wiping with plain water. 
* **Faster mop spinning**: the mops can spin up to 260rpm, and when I ran it in CleanGenius deep clean mode, the mopping was noticeably louder, suggesting it was spinning faster than the regular 180rpm. 
* **Better synergy**: I suspect the improved vacuuming internals are helping remove more invisible dust, which gives the mops a clearer path to scrub deeper grime.

I do wish the CleanGenius icon gave more insight into what it’s doing, other than just vaguely telling me “CleanGenius is cleaning.”

For under-the-counter cleaning in the kitchen, the robot lowered its lidar and hugged the edges appropriately. Good bot. I’ve heard some other V50 Ultras get less efficient when their lidar retracts, but I haven’t seen that myself. I’d need a giant balsa wood obstacle course to test that properly.

[The fur in the dustbin is compressed to one end of the dustbin so it can collect as much fur as possible](https://preview.redd.it/c0w6kulpi5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=657daaaef5dd697f09cec71ce2e289fc5668ad75)

The dustbin tells the whole story. Compared to my old robot, fur was visibly compressed, making far better use of the bin space—credit to MOVA’s hair compression feature. The base station even blows air through the filter during the auto-empty cycle, clearing out the clingy dust bunnies that used to get stuck in the pleats. The result? I went from smacking the filter against the trash can every night to cleaning it maybe once every two weeks.

[No hair or fur was stuck around the axles of the omnidirectional wheel.](https://preview.redd.it/31v3fwa7j5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=641f69fc47f4683c7d66dfd1424a6147e43be86b)

[No fur was tangled on the dual TroboWave brushes, with fur clinging to the bristles](https://preview.redd.it/qummmixdj5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df60ac2e947908e254cd0f0f4a3bb63f55fc8da7)

[Upon closer insepction, the only the brush with bristles has some fur with it but it is not tangled.](https://preview.redd.it/bejzg32jj5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=50b9eb4a5b5c899908b35b1f56cde99b3b658311)

[Only a few strands of fur remain in the brush compartment after the brushes are removed. ](https://preview.redd.it/1oi3zr7nj5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e733e4557c82eac1b15497ee6bc0bf942052a482)

And the anti-tangle claims? Not just marketing. Even waist-length hair—longer than the advertised 11.8” (30 cm) limit—didn’t tangle in the TroboWave™ dual brushes, the side brush, or the omnidirectional wheel. It was also brilliant on carpets, where the dual-brush system agitated and lifted my dog’s fur far more effectively than my old single-brush bot ever managed.

My family, who all work from home, immediately noticed how quiet it was. While mopping at 180 rpm, it was nearly silent. During a vacuum run, I measured it at a conversation-friendly 55–60 dB—noticeable, but never disruptive.

# The Coffee Granule Test

To push beyond marketing specs, I simulated a tough mess using freeze-dried coffee—a mix of large granules and fine powder. I set the robot to CleanGenius mode with “large particle boost” enabled.

[The original spill of instant coffee powder](https://preview.redd.it/i7hc699xf5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb983bb958dea075e6373402e69c53295a80d3fe)

[After the second pass, no instant coffee was left behind](https://preview.redd.it/2ngzj89xf5if1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4b11d3febede717b8b481c271148829ddb1cde60)

What followed was a masterclass in intelligent cleaning. The robot:

* Correctly identified the spill and its size, marked it on the app, and slowed its approach.
* Increased suction while reducing the side brush speed to gently sweep granules inward.
* Lifted the side brush entirely when crossing the main spill to prevent scattering.
* Made two slow, methodical passes in perpendicular directions, creating a grid-like pattern.

After the first pass, every large granule was gone. After the second, so was the fine coffee dust. A perfect pickup.

MOVA claims its pet odor neutralizing solution really works, so I put it to the test. I turned on high-frequency mode, which uses the solution every time it washes the mops, to tackle that classic “wet dog” smell after my pup’s adventures in the grass. After just one vacuum first and then mop cycle, the only place I could smell the dog was… well, on the dog himself. Floors? Fresh and odor-free. 

**AI Obstacle Avoidance**

I tested the robot in a chaotic environment littered with obstacles: charging cables on the floor, a camera tripod with legs low enough to ride up, chairs with just enough clearance to be a trap, and dog toys everywhere. My old robot would have been instantly stuck thanks to my dog, who loves to sploot right in the middle of the hallway. But the MOVA navigated everything without getting stuck once.

What impressed me most was watching its adaptive AI learn in real time. On day one, it clumsily tried to climb the tripod legs. By day two, it was more cautious, riding up on them only about half the time. On day three, it had figured it out completely and cleaned neatly along the legs without mounting them at all.

**OmniDry: Mop and Dustbin Drying**

MOVA also touts its OmniDry system, which uses warm air to dry the mops, the internal washboard, and even the dustbin and dustbag to prevent mildew and odors. MOVA doesn’t list an official drying temperature, but a similar feature on another premium robot by its parent Dreame uses 122°F (50°C) air.

Even at 86% humidity, the system dried the mops and washboard in just one hour on “Quick Dry.” To test the dustbin drying, I dampened some dog fur, put it in the dustbag, and ran a three-hour drying cycle — after which the fur felt completely dry.

Theoretically, this thorough drying should help stop mold and odor growth. It’s only been about 1,000 m² (\~10,000 ft²) of cleaning so far, so it’s too early to confirm long-term benefits, but the initial signs look very promising

**Self-Cleaning & Maintenance**

The base station does a solid job cutting down on daily chores, though it’s not completely hands-off. The auto-empty cycle is strong enough to clear fine dust from the filter’s pleats, but I did notice a few strands of my dog’s fur stubbornly clinging to the filter’s rubber seal.

[The JetSpray Dryboard, as pictured, was able to keep itself rather clean with oly a few stray strands of fur remaining on the mop washboard and no visible grime stuck to any nooks and crannies. ](https://preview.redd.it/ylldb4lhe5if1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=58a820016e8e1e640db55f04426f3fbb79d6867a)

The mop washing system is a huge step up from my old robot, whose washboard was always a magnet for fur and grime. After about 1,000 m² of cleaning, the MOVA’s washboard stayed impressively clean, with all the debris collected neatly in a removable, palm-sized drainage filter that’s easy to rinse under the tap.

[Despite keeping the mop washboard relatively clean, fine dust and dirt builds up under the drainage filter over time as shown here.](https://preview.redd.it/e3sabf7yc5if1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af7e4220d12f800e7fb91d0069acf2ca2b61e347)

That said, a fine layer of sludge does build up over time in the tray beneath the filter. Since the washboard assembly itself isn’t removable, you have to get down on your hands and knees to clean that part manually. I wish the robot either cleaned this area automatically or had a removable tray for easier maintenance.

All up, this makes a night-and-day difference in my daily routine.

With my old robot, my daily maintenance checklist looked like this:

* Tapping dust out of the filter
* Picking trapped fur off the washboard
* Rescuing it from cables that it tried to chew or the tripod it kept trying to climb

Now, with the MOVA, my main tasks are simply refilling the clean water tank and emptying the dirty one. The robot and base station stay so much cleaner that a proper hands-on clean is only needed every few weeks—definitely not every single day.

**Battery Life & Charging**

To gauge real-world battery efficiency, I ran the robot on customized cleaning cycles with consistent settings.

The results weren’t quite as impressive as I’d hoped they'd be, as it has a battery capacity of 6400mAh. On a standard vacuuming run, it cleaned just under 1 m² (\~10.5 ft²) per 1% of battery used. When mopping, efficiency more than doubled, covering over 2 m² (\~22.3 ft²) per percentage point consumed.

In practice, after a full CleanGenius vacuum cycle followed by a mop run over my entire home, the robot typically consumes about 60% of its battery per cleaning session. In contrast, my old robot, with a smaller 5200 mAh battery, used around 40% for the same vacuum-then-mop routine.

For larger homes of around 100 m² (\~1,075 ft²) or more, the “resume cleaning” feature is necessary, letting the robot return to its base to recharge before it resumes cleaning.

Charging speeds are solid as well: it charges rapidly at roughly 1% per minute until hitting 20%, then slows to about 0.5% per minute to preserve battery health over time. You can also protect the battery's long-term health by setting a charge limit in the app, with options for 80%, 90%, or a full 100%.

# Pros & Cons

**Pros:** Very quiet, great with handling a lot of fur and hair, mops quite well and quietly, hot mop washing effectively lifts grease from the mops, pretty hands off, a smaller and more squat base station compared to some others, the customization for your robot is plentiful, the charging limit is a step forward in ensuring the longetivity of your robot’s battery, charges pretty quick

**Cons:** not a fan of the glossy white plastic used as it’s a fingerprint magnet, you’d still need to manually clean the dirt and dust that builds up at the mop washboard’s drainage area, there is no way to manually customize how fast the mop spins as the mops only speed up on CleanGenius deep cleaning mode or when stain detection is turned on, slightly smaller water tanks of a 1 gallon clean water tank and a 0.9 dirty water tank compared to similarly priced options on the market (this is a tradeoff if you prefer a smaller base station) do mean more frequently refilling, the app’s near unlimited customization makes the UI a bit cluttered and requires a learning curve for those not as tech snazzy, the battery life is actually strangely short. 

# TLDR:

**Get it if:**

* You want a robot that’ll reliably dodge cables and other things that could trip up dumb bots, so you won’t need to rescue it all the time. 
* You have a pet that sheds a lot and/or stinks a lot, making the floors stinky despite your best attempts to coax it into having a bath. 
* Your home has long hair that you and other family members are shedding. 
* You want a quiet robot that happily zips around 
* Your home has more hard floors than carpet. 
* You have thresholds in your home, like sliding door frames, and thresholds in different rooms, like the bathroom or the kitchen. 

**Don’t get it if:**

* Your home is mostly carpet (vacuuming only robots are better suited)
* You want a robot that can be later plumbed into your laundry water lines. 
* You want it to clean under places with a clearance of 8.9cm or lower. 
* You want MO from Wall-E to say foreign contaminant every time it starts cleaning.  
* A totally hands-free robot vacuum that requires absolutely no maintenance (unless you were smart enough to tell your future self that to deliver one to you with a Time Machine)

I'm happy to answer any questions you have about this robot or my experience in the comments below! Stay tuned for my in-depth review in a few weeks, where I'll test its long-term autonomy to see how it truly holds up with minimal maintenance—just refilling and emptying the tanks!

Hi everyone,  
I’d love to share a personal story from the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival — a memory that shaped my whole life.

Back then I was just an Italian teenager, suddenly surrounded by more than 100,000 people, living for three days on yogurt and oranges, amazed by Free turning a love song into a hymn for the crowd, and capturing it all in a little Super-8 film.

Those days eventually led me to become Italy’s first female rock DJ, a music critic, a journalist — and today I still share music and stories with more than 36,000 people in my community “CIAO2001”.

**HOW A ROCK FESTIVAL MADE ME WHO I AM: THE GIRL WHO ATE ONLY YOGURT**

In August 1970, an Italian teenager suddenly found herself among more than 100,000 people on the Isle of Wight.  
She had no idea those three days would change her life forever…

They called her the girl who ate only yogurt.  
She sacrificed a pair of flared jeans, cutting them into strips up to the knee.  
Underneath, wisely, she wore a pink bikini — ready to show if the sun got too hot.  
On top, a long-haired vest. Was it synthetic? She still isn’t sure.  
(You can check in the legendary Super-8 film she later put together…)

She had been invited by Chris, an English friend she met in London in a tea room with Carla.  
A kind guy… dressed in yellow and pink.  
Specimens like that didn’t exist yet in Italy.

A rock festival? She didn’t worry much.  
She carried a tent, a change of clothes, and boarded a little train from London to the ferry.  
The train was ancient, with wooden chairs, never arriving on time.  
Alienating enough — and Chris spoke no Italian.

Three days with no words in her language… but there was all that music.  
Music from dawn till night.  
And when you stumbled back to your tent, people were still strumming inside.

Vendors passed through the arena like at the cinema — boxes full of popcorn, chips, drinks…  
Except here the box also carried sinsemilla, acid, heroin, amphetamines.  
She refused all of it.  
She was almost puritanical: never smoked a joint, lived on yogurt and oranges for three days.

The sun was hot.  
You lay down on the grass, looked at the sky, and listened.  
John Sebastian floated above in a hot-air balloon, people pointing up in amazement.

There were disturbing announcements from the stage — someone lost, someone unwell — but she barely understood them.  
Perhaps it was better that way.

Leaving the arena, they stamped your wrist.  
Without it, you couldn’t return.  
It felt like a dream — suspended, ecstatic, unreal.  
Some tried to break into the gates.  
Others watched for free from the hills, the sound carrying everywhere.

Flags waved among the crowd — even Italian ones — but she didn’t meet her compatriots.  
Later she would, in her work: musicians, friends, even the band Le Orme.

Morning meant lining up to wash at a tap in the middle of nowhere, with the coldest water she had ever felt on her skin.  
Better than coffee.

And then — why is everyone standing?  
Why are thousands holding hands, arms raised to the sky?  
Free are on stage.  
Their song, born as a love tune, has turned into a hymn, a premonition, an unstoppable wave of energy.

“All right now, baby it’s all right now…”  
Over and over, as if the music itself had taken command.  
The band seemed astonished by the audience’s response.  
The girl who ate only yogurt was speechless.  
She wanted to say something in Italian, but Chris wouldn’t understand.  
So she stayed silent, letting the experience quietly shape her future.

Yes, of course — the girl who ate only yogurt was me.  
That teenager came back from the Isle of Wight forever changed.  
She didn’t know it then, but those three days had planted the seed of her life’s work.

Back in Italy she became the first female rock DJ, a music critic, a journalist.  
A voice for a generation that wanted to dream bigger.  
And that voice has never stopped.

Today more than 36,000 members and 25,000 visitors gather around the community she created, “CIAO2001”, where people still thank her daily for opening new worlds of music and ideas.

The girl who ate only yogurt is still here — still loved, still sharing, still rock.  
And one day, I’ll tell the whole story.

I have been managing an on-site team for over 5 years, and when I first started, everything happened face-to-face: like daily office standups, quick coffee chats, and plenty of in-person problem solving. 

Lately, I’ve been thinking about taking on a fully remote leadership role. I’ve heard mixed stories: some people say that remote managing is way more challenging, others swear it’s more efficient once you find the right rhythm.

If you’ve led remote teams, what was the transition like for you? Any best practices for managing remote teams? 

Appreciate your advice on this!

Those concerns were raised on the sidelines at Friday’s opening of the semi-annual China Cross-Border E-Commerce Trade Fair in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong province, which concludes on Sunday. 

With booths at the fair, major online retail platforms – including Shein, PDD Holdings-owned Temu, ByteDance-run TikTok Shop and American e-commerce giant Amazon.com – sought to woo more exporters to open online shops on their sites, which target the US and other overseas markets. 

Amazon.com trainer Sandy Zhu, for example, suggested that newcomers to the platform, which caters to 20 overseas markets, sell to the US because traffic was big and doing business there had a “lower threshold” for merchants to navigate.

Still, Guangdong Mingjian Electronics Technology, whose portable coffee machines are sold on Amazon.com, was still “worried about policy uncertainties” in spite of the extended tariff truce, said Chen Jianlun, who represented the Chinese firm at the fair. Chen pointed out that the company was forced to suspend its US business for nearly two months from April, when bilateral trade relations went sour.

That uneasiness reflected the lingering uncertainties over US President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, which has dampened Chinese exporters’ business confidence amid three rounds of high-level talks between trade negotiators of the world’s two largest economies.

According to Tank Zhou, a sales manager at e-commerce logistics and supply chain provider EDA Group, many clients suspended US shipments for about a month during the initial US tariff hike. “Although shipments have restarted, merchants feel they’re passive [in making decisions]”, he said. 

Other cross-border exporters who depend on seasonal sales campaigns lost business as a result of Trump’s trade war. Festive decorations supplier Yiwu Shuangyuan Christmas Artware, in eastern Zhejiang province, typically secured clients in the first half of the year to schedule deliveries during the holiday season.

“Some deals collapsed during the initial tariff hike,” saleswoman Zhu Xiaolin said. Still, the company managed to sign up enough clients to meet this year’s Christmas shipment, she added.

Pushing Beijing to buy more US goods is one of Washington’s priorities. Just ahead of the tariff truce deadline, Trump urged China to quadruple its orders of American soybeans – a major US export to China. Trump said last week that he and President Xi Jinping could meet “before the end of the year” if both sides can come to a trade deal.

Zhou from EDA, which provides warehousing services to Chinese exporters in foreign countries, said he advised clients to pursue a “multimarket strategy” that would expand their business beyond the US. He said the company expected its warehouses in Germany and the UK to see faster growth this third quarter, as more merchants diversified their market strategy.

Meanwhile, Chen from Guangdong Mingjian Electronics said the firm was exploring opportunities under China’s Belt and Road Initiative. These would include South Africa and other countries on that continent.

Mercado Libre, the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America, has received more inquiries over the past few months, according to the site’s merchant acquisition manager, Jason Li. He said Mercado Libre recently lowered the threshold to open a shop on the platform, which used to require merchants to have a record of selling on other platforms. That change and US policy uncertainty were the factors behind the increased inquiries, he added.",3,1755448741.0,TrumpTariffNews,1,1.0,False

I (21F) have been managing a coffee shop for a little over a year. This company has two locations and I am their only store manager. This year has been a rough one. My bosses are a couple who don’t seem to communicate anything to each other and then get mad at me for it. They have no structure, no manners, and no respect for anyone who works for them. It’s created a very stressful work environment for me but I was able to handle it for a while. My health started to take a turn for the worst a couple months ago. Not to mention, I hate coffee. I don’t even drink it, I have tea each day so my caffeine intake isn’t that high. Coffee isn’t and will never be a career I want to take much further than I already have. My bosses have noticed my health declines and have been respectful during the times I’ve needed to go to the emergency room or the doctors office, however they still keep me under the same amount of stress and have not helped me make my work life any easier. They’re always on my ass about how I need to do more each day. It’s gotten to the point where they don’t even say hello to me they just get straight to why isn’t this done. Which I don’t find fair, because most of the time I either have already done it, it’s been tool busy for me to get to the tasks, or I’m in the process of doing it. They’re just mean and everyone knows it. It’s actually an ongoing joke with the store about how my bosses are so nice to everyone but they’re actually assholes when it comes to me. I have just about had it. So I decided that now would be a good time to pursue something I’m actually passionate about. Which is makeup, I’ve loved makeup since I was like 11 year old and it has been my dream to work in the beauty felid. After some job hunting I found a great and high paying job opportunity to work in makeup sales and services. After a long interview process I got the job! I put in my two weeks where I currently work and selected a start date. The day I come in after sending my two weeks email to my bosses, they don’t talk to me. They would leave rooms if I entered, pretend they didn’t hear me when I talked to them, and all around just make an active effort to not talk to me. Today one of my bosses actually talked to me, and what he said took me back. They said they wanted to meet with me on Monday to discuss me possibly demoting myself and working as a barista instead of a store manager, so that way I wouldn’t need to leave them and I don’t have to push myself.  I had tried to make it clear that I have another job lined up and I don’t really want to do that, but they’re being very insistent about talking about it on Monday. not mentioned before but I have OCD, so right now I’m really anxious.

*“Between stimulus and response lies a space. In that space lies our freedom and power to choose a response. In our response lies our growth and our happiness.”- Viktor Frankl*

I often say that thinking clearly is not a luxury — it’s a necessity. Yet, in the fast pace of everyday life, we rarely stop to ask ourselves whether our thinking process truly serves us, or whether it is being carried away by habits, automatic reactions, and mental shortcuts.

A few years ago, before I read Daniel Kahneman’s *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, I almost always relied on my first instinct. I would make quick decisions, confident that I was “decisive.” But over time, I realized that this habit was costing me — — in missed opportunities, in decisions I had to revisit later, and in the stress of constantly reacting instead of calmly evaluating.

This article is not a theoretical essay. It’s a practical guide — — drawn from my own experience, conversations with friends, and everyday professional challenges — — on how to slow down your thinking when it matters most.

# The Laboratory of Friendship

One of the friends I often mention in these discussions is Kostas. He is not only a dear friend but also an excellent collaborator. Many times, our dialogues become real “thinking laboratories,” where we dissect decisions, motives, and consequences. It’s through such conversations that I’ve come to realize: slowing down your thinking is neither simple nor quick — — but it’s not difficult either.

The challenge lies in creating space between the stimulus and your response — — a gap where conscious thought can enter. Kahneman describes two systems of thinking:

* **System 1**: fast, automatic, intuitive.
* **System 2**: slow, deliberate, analytical.

Most of the time, System 1 works perfectly well. It helps us navigate daily routines without overthinking every little action. But when decisions carry weight — — in business, relationships, or personal growth — — System 1 can mislead us.

Here’s the tricky part: System 1 feels natural. It feels *right*. Which means that when you try to engage System 2, it can feel unnatural, even uncomfortable. For me, it took deliberate practice.

# The Cost of Quick Decisions: Real Examples

Before diving into solutions, let’s examine what happens when we consistently rely on System 1 thinking in high-stakes situations. The business world is littered with examples of companies that made catastrophic decisions because they moved too fast without proper analysis.

Consider Kodak, a company that actually invented the digital camera in 1975 but decided not to pursue it aggressively because they feared it would cannibalize their profitable film business. Their System 1 thinking said: “Protect what’s working now.” They didn’t engage System 2 to ask: “What if the world changes completely?” By the time they realized their mistake, companies like Canon and Nikon had captured the digital photography market.

Similarly, Blockbuster had multiple opportunities to adapt to the streaming revolution. When Netflix offered to sell their company to Blockbuster for $50 million in 2000, Blockbuster’s leadership relied on their gut feeling that physical stores were the future. They didn’t slow down to analyze changing consumer behavior or technological trends. Today, Netflix is worth over $150 billion.

But it’s not just large corporations. I’ve witnessed smaller businesses make similar mistakes. A local restaurant owner I know decided to expand to three locations simultaneously because “business was booming.” He didn’t pause to analyze cash flow projections, market saturation, or operational capacity. Within eighteen months, all three new locations were closed, and he nearly lost his original restaurant too.

The pattern is always the same: when pressure mounts, we default to what feels right in the moment, without creating space for deeper analysis.

# Building Your Personal Thinking Laboratory

I started keeping notes — — not just bullet points like in a notepad, but diary-style entries. I wrote down not only my decisions but also the thoughts, emotions, and conversations that led to them. Over time, these entries became a mirror for my thinking patterns.

Kostas often laughed when he saw me pull out my notebook in the middle of a coffee conversation. “Are you writing about me again?” he’d joke. But those notes became invaluable, because they captured not only what I thought but also *how* I thought at that moment.

One of the most common questions I now ask myself is **“Why?”** — — but not in the simple, surface way. It often comes in layers:

1. *Why should I do this now?*
2. *What will I gain?*
3. *What is the cost if I wait?*

Before reading Kahneman’s book, my answer to “When?” was almost always “Now.” I believed that quick action was the sign of decisiveness. But I’ve learned that there’s a difference between speed and timing.

Sometimes the right moment isn’t *now* — — it’s after you’ve seen more, learned more, or prepared better. Other times, hesitation only increases the risk of missed opportunities.

# A Case Study in Collaborative Thinking

Kostas and I once had a conversation about launching a new product that perfectly illustrates the power of combining System 1 and System 2 thinking. We had developed a software tool for small businesses, and I was eager to launch immediately. The market seemed ready, we had a working prototype, and every entrepreneurial instinct in my body was screaming “Go!”

My System 1 reasoning was simple: “Strike while the iron is hot. Competitors might enter the market. Every day we wait is a day of lost revenue.”

But Kostas had a different perspective. He suggested we wait six weeks until after a major industry trade fair where we could get direct feedback from potential customers. His System 2 thinking involved several layers of analysis:

* *What if our assumptions about customer needs are wrong?*
* *What’s the cost of fixing fundamental issues after launch versus before?*
* *How much more confident would we be with real user feedback?*

We debated for hours over multiple coffee sessions. I kept pushing for immediate action; he kept advocating for strategic patience. Finally, we decided to test both approaches on a smaller scale. We launched a limited beta version to gather some immediate market feedback while simultaneously preparing for the trade fair presentation.

The results were eye-opening. The beta users revealed three critical usability issues we hadn’t considered. More importantly, at the trade fair, we discovered that our target market had a completely different set of priorities than we had assumed. Those six weeks of “delay” actually saved us months of pivoting later.

Looking back, that single conversation contained all the elements of Kahneman’s thinking: my fast, intuitive System 1 versus his slower, analytical System 2. And in the end, by combining them, we got the timing *exactly* right.

# Building Your Decision-Making Toolkit

Beyond journaling and collaborative thinking, I’ve developed several specific techniques that help engage System 2 thinking when it matters most:

**The 10–10–10 Rule**: Before making any significant decision, I ask myself: How will I feel about this choice in 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years? This simple framework helps distinguish between short-term emotions and long-term consequences. The restaurant owner I mentioned earlier might have avoided his expansion disaster if he had honestly considered how he’d feel about managing three locations in 10 months when the initial excitement wore off.

**The Devil’s Advocate Approach**: I deliberately argue against my initial instinct. If I want to hire someone, I force myself to list reasons why I shouldn’t. If I’m excited about a new market opportunity, I research why it might fail. This isn’t pessimism; it’s intellectual honesty. It helps uncover blind spots that System 1 thinking often misses.

**Pre-mortem Analysis**: Instead of conducting post-mortems after things go wrong, I conduct pre-mortems before making major decisions. I imagine the decision has failed spectacularly and work backwards to identify what could have gone wrong. This technique, developed by psychologist Gary Klein, has helped me avoid numerous potential disasters.

# The Art of Strategic Documentation

It’s not simple — — not quick — — but it’s also not impossible. The hardest part is resisting the urge to rush just because *you can*.

I now keep something like a journal — — not a notebook with bullet points, but a place where I write *all* my thoughts and conversations about a decision. Sometimes it’s a half-page. Sometimes it’s five pages of back-and-forth reasoning.

Why? Because our memory tends to rewrite history. We forget the doubts, the side discussions, the subtle signs that pointed us in a certain direction. And when we forget, we lose the ability to learn from our own process.

A written record also has another benefit: When I revisit those pages, I see how my perspective evolved. I can spot where emotion pushed me one way and where logic pulled me another. It’s like watching your own decision-making in slow motion — — and that’s a powerful teacher.

But documentation serves another crucial purpose: it creates accountability. When you know you’ll have to write down your reasoning, you naturally think more carefully about that reasoning. The act of writing forces you to clarify vague thoughts and examine assumptions you might otherwise take for granted.

# When Environment Shapes Thinking

Another practice I recommend is to **change your environment** when facing important decisions.

For example, I often tell my friends to take a walk on a quiet beach or find a calm place away from daily distractions. Kostas tried this recently and told me: “It’s like pressing a reset button on my mind.”

The shift in environment helps slow down the racing thoughts, making it easier to engage System 2 thinking. When you’re alone with your thoughts — — with nothing pulling your attention away — — clarity emerges.

It’s not a magic formula, but it works more often than not. And it’s a reminder that sometimes, *where* you think matters just as much as *what* you think.

I’ve noticed that different environments trigger different types of thinking. Coffee shops with gentle background noise help me with creative problem-solving. Quiet libraries push me toward analytical thinking. Walking outdoors often leads to breakthrough insights. The key is to match the environment to the type of thinking your decision requires.

# When Speed Actually Matters: The Paradox of Timing

One of the biggest traps for entrepreneurs is relying solely on instinct, especially when under pressure. But there’s an equally dangerous trap on the other side: analysis paralysis.

Remember, instinct is your brain’s fast System 1 — — it evolved to keep you safe, not to run a business. It’s brilliant for spotting danger and making snap decisions but can mislead you when the stakes are complex or unclear.

Kostas once shared a story about a deal he almost lost because he trusted his gut without checking the details. He says: “I thought I was being decisive, but I was actually being reckless.”

However, there are situations where System 1 thinking is not just helpful but essential. Crisis management is one such area. When your website crashes during a product launch, when a key employee quits unexpectedly, or when a competitor launches a direct attack on your market position, you don’t have the luxury of extensive analysis.

The key is learning to recognize which situations require which type of thinking. Here are some guidelines I’ve developed:

**Use System 1 when**:

* The decision is reversible with minimal cost
* You have extensive experience in similar situations
* Time pressure is genuine (not just self-imposed)
* The cost of delay clearly exceeds the risk of error

**Use System 2 when**:

* The decision will be expensive or difficult to reverse
* You’re entering unfamiliar territory
* Multiple stakeholders will be significantly affected
* You notice strong emotions influencing your judgment

# Creating Systems, Not Just Habits

Individual decision-making improvements are valuable, but if you’re building a business, you need to think systemically. How do you ensure that good decision-making becomes part of your company’s DNA, not just your personal practice?

Start by documenting your decision-making processes. When you make a significant choice, write down not just what you decided but how you decided. Over time, these documents become templates that others can follow.

Create mandatory “pause points” for major decisions. In my current company, no decision involving more than $10,000 or affecting more than five people can be made without a 48-hour waiting period. This isn’t bureaucracy; it’s a system that forces System 2 engagement.

Establish devil’s advocate roles in team meetings. Rotate this responsibility so it doesn’t always fall on the same person, but make sure someone is always tasked with challenging group consensus. Some of our best decisions have emerged from these structured debates.

Finally, conduct regular decision reviews. Monthly, we look back at major choices made three to six months earlier. What worked? What didn’t? What would we do differently? This isn’t about blame; it’s about learning. And the knowledge that decisions will be reviewed makes everyone more thoughtful in the moment.

# The Evolution of Decision-Making

Reflecting on these experiences, I realize how much my relationship with decision-making has changed.

Before Kahneman, I acted quickly, sometimes too quickly. Now, I pause. I ask questions like: *What assumptions am I making?* *Have I considered alternatives?* *What evidence supports this choice?*

These questions aren’t about slowing down for the sake of it. They’re about making space for clarity and confidence.

But perhaps the most important change is this: I’ve learned to see decision-making as a skill that can be developed, not just a talent you’re born with. Like any skill, it improves with practice, feedback, and reflection.

And here’s a question for you: **Have you ever caught yourself rushing a decision, only to regret it later?** If so, I’d love to hear your story — — sometimes, sharing our experiences teaches us more than any book.

# The Entrepreneurial Balance

In the end, entrepreneurship is a journey between instinct and analysis, intuition and strategy. The entrepreneurs who master both — — who know when to trust their gut and when to engage their mind — — are the ones who thrive.

The goal isn’t to become slow and methodical in everything you do. It’s to become conscious about when speed serves you and when it sabotages you. It’s about building the capacity to shift gears deliberately, to move fast when the situation calls for it and slow down when deeper thinking is required.

This consciousness, this ability to choose your thinking mode rather than being at its mercy, might be the most valuable skill an entrepreneur can develop. Because in business, as in life, it’s not just what you decide that matters — — it’s how you decide.

The space between stimulus and response, between problem and solution, between opportunity and action — — that’s where wisdom lives. And in that space, both Systems 1 and 2 have their place. The art is knowing which one to trust, and when.

## Key Features Analysis

the rattan coffee table with a glass top offers a unique combination of aesthetic appeal and practical design, making it a versatile addition to any living space. Its key features center around the materials used, the construction method, and the overall design considerations.

**Rattan Frame Construction:**

The frame of the coffee table is primarily constructed from natural or synthetic rattan. Natural rattan offers a warm,organic look,while synthetic rattan (often polyethylene or PVC-based) provides enhanced durability and weather resistance. The rattan is typically woven or wrapped around a solid wood or metal frame for added support and structural integrity. The quality of the rattan used directly impacts the table's longevity and resistance to wear and tear. Different weaving patterns,such as herringbone or wicker,add visual interest and contribute to the table's overall style.**Tempered Glass Top:**

The tabletop is made from tempered glass, which is substantially stronger and safer than standard glass. Tempered glass undergoes a heat treatment process that makes it more resistant to impact and breakage. In the event of breakage,it shatters into small,blunt pieces rather than sharp shards,reducing the risk of injury. The thickness of the tempered glass typically ranges from 5mm to 10mm, depending on the size and design of the table. A thicker glass top provides greater stability and can support heavier items.

**Weight Capacity:**

The weight capacity of the rattan coffee table with a glass top is an important factor to consider. This determines the maximum weight the table can safely support without compromising its structural integrity. The weight capacity varies depending on the table's size, materials, and construction. Typically, a well-built coffee table can support between 50 to 100 pounds. Exceeding this weight limit can lead to damage to the rattan frame or breakage of the glass top.

**Assembly Hardware and fasteners:**

The assembly process relies on various hardware and fasteners, including screws, bolts, washers, and Allen wrenches (hex keys). High-quality hardware ensures a secure and stable connection between the different components of the table. The instructions usually indicate the specific type and size of each fastener required for each step.Utilizing incorrect fasteners can compromise the structural integrity of the table and possibly damage the rattan or glass. It is crucial to use only the provided hardware and follow the instructions carefully.

## Core Benefits

The rattan coffee table with a glass top delivers several tangible benefits to its users, combining aesthetic appeal with practical functionality.these benefits enhance the overall usability and enjoyment of the living space.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:**

The rattan coffee table with a glass top brings a natural, textured element into the living space, enhancing its overall aesthetic appeal. The combination of the woven rattan frame and the transparent glass top creates a visually appealing contrast that complements various interior design styles, from coastal and bohemian to contemporary and minimalist. The rattan adds warmth and organic charm, while the glass top provides a sleek and modern touch. This combination makes the table a focal point that elevates the visual appeal of the room.

**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning:**

The materials used in the rattan coffee table with a glass top are relatively easy to maintain and clean. The glass top can be easily wiped clean with a glass cleaner and a soft cloth, removing fingerprints, spills, and dust. The rattan frame can be cleaned with a damp cloth or a soft brush to remove dirt and debris. Synthetic rattan is especially easy to maintain as it is resistant to moisture and fading.

## FAQs Section

This section addresses common questions and concerns regarding the assembly and use of the rattan coffee table with a glass top.

**What tools are needed for assembling the rattan coffee table with a glass top?**

Typically,the assembly process requires a Phillips head screwdriver,an Allen wrench (hex key),and possibly a rubber mallet. Some models may include all necessary tools, while others may require you to provide them. It's always recommended to have a soft cloth or blanket on hand to protect the glass top during assembly.

**How do I protect the glass top during the assembly process?**

Protecting the glass top is crucial to prevent scratches or breakage. Before starting the assembly, lay down a soft cloth or blanket on the floor.

Avoid dragging the glass top across the floor or stacking heavy objects on top of it.

**What if I am missing a part during the assembly process?**

If you discover that a part is missing, contact the manufacturer or retailer immediately.

## Key Features Analysis

The best muscle tees need to strike a balance between comfort, style, and durability. Several key features contribute to a tee’s overall quality and suitability for different activities.

**Fabric Composition**

The fabric is paramount in determining the comfort and lifespan of a muscle tee. The best options utilize high-quality cotton blends, often incorporating polyester or spandex for added stretch and shape retention. Premium tees use materials like Supima cotton or modal, known for thier exceptional softness and drape. Cheaper alternatives rely on lower-grade cotton or synthetic materials that can feel stiff, shrink easily, or pill after a few washes. Good fabric construction ensures minimal transparency and allows for good breathability.

**fit and Cut**

The cut of a muscle tee differentiates it from standard tank tops or t-shirts. A properly fitted muscle tee has wider, dropped armholes that allow for a full range of motion without excessive exposure. The overall silhouette is typically relaxed but not overly baggy, emphasizing a balance between comfort and a flattering shape. The length should be appropriate for the intended use, falling at or slightly below the hips for most women. some variations include cropped styles or those with a longer, tunic-like hemline.

**Neckline Design**

The neckline considerably contributes to the aesthetic of a muscle tee. Crew necks are classic and versatile,suitable for both casual and athletic wear.V-necks add a touch of femininity and can be more flattering for certain body types. Scoop necks offer a slightly more relaxed and open feel. Some muscle tees feature unique neckline details, such as raw edges, subtle distressing, or ribbed textures, adding visual interest without sacrificing comfort.

**construction Quality**

Superior construction is key to the durability of a muscle tee. Look for reinforced seams at stress points like the armholes and neckline to prevent tearing or fraying. Double-needle stitching enhances the overall strength and longevity of the garment.Check for even stitching and clean finishing,avoiding any loose threads or uneven hems,which are indicators of poor quality.A well-constructed tee will retain its shape and integrity even after repeated washing and wearing.

**Color and Print Options**

The availability of diverse color and print options ensures that a muscle tee can easily integrate into your existing wardrobe. Basic neutrals like black, white, gray, and navy are essential building blocks, while seasonal colors and trendy patterns offer opportunities for personal expression. Solid colors provide versatility,while subtle prints,such as stripes or graphic designs,can add visual interest. The best brands offer a wide range of options, allowing consumers to find the perfect muscle tee to match their individual style and preferences.

Over the last couple of weeks, I’ve been using it to shield my ScanSnap iX1600, and it’s become a staple in my workspace. I’ve tested it in real-world conditions, and while it absolutely has its strengths, there are some minor areas to consider before making a purchase.

**Design and Material Quality**  
The first thing that stood out to me about this cover was its simple yet effective design. It’s sleek, black, and fits neatly over my ScanSnap iX1600. Crafted from 600D nylon, the material feels durable, and its water-resistant properties give me peace of mind. I’ve spilled coffee more times than I’d like to admit, and knowing this cover can handle spills without soaking through is a relief. Its antistatic and dustproof features keep the interior debris-free, which is essential for ensuring my scanner operates efficiently. However, the material could be a bit thicker for added protection against accidental bumps or drops.

**Ease of Use and Practicality**  
Sliding this cover on and off the scanner is practically effortless. It fits snugly, meaning there are no loose ends, and it doesn’t look bulky sitting on my desk. When not in use, this cover can be folded up compactly, which is great since desk space is always a premium in my office. My coworker, who uses a similar scanner, commented on how much cleaner and organized it makes the desk look. Cleaning is a breeze, too—just a quick wipe with a damp cloth, and it looks brand new again. I do wish it came with a way to secure it in place, perhaps an elastic band or Velcro strap, to ensure it doesn’t shift when bumped.

[See Wanty Wanty deals on Amazon now.](https://metaversegenome.com/p/b07pytv6v1/)

**Compatibility and Fit**  
This dust cover is explicitly designed to fit ScanSnap models iX1400, iX1500, and the iX1600, so the compatibility is spot on. I personally own the iX1600, and it fits like a glove. The dimensions—12.20 X 6.29 X 7.08 inches—are well-suited for these models, but it wouldn’t work for larger or unusually shaped scanners. If you own devices from other brands or older scanner models, you’d need to double-check if this works for you. A slightly more versatile design could make it a good choice for users with multiple devices.

**Performance and Durability**  
Performance-wise, the cover performs as intended. Its antistatic property keeps dust at bay, a noticeable difference compared to when my scanner sat uncovered for days. On warmer days, I worried about heat buildup, but the material seems breathable enough to avoid any issues. From a durability perspective, the nylon holds up well to daily wear and tear. That said, after a couple of weeks, I could see minor fraying around the edges, but nothing that compromises its functionality.

**Key Benefits**  
- Protects against dust, spills, and scratches  
- Water-resistant material for added safety  
- Compact and foldable design for easy storage  

**Areas of Improvement**  
- Lack of a strap or elastic to secure it in place  
- Material could be slightly thicker for better impact protection  

**Customer Opinions and Ratings**  
The majority of other reviews I found online reflect my positive experience. With a 4.7-star rating and users praising its practical features, it’s clear that many people find it useful for their office setups. The occasional critique revolves around its limited compatibility and the absence of reinforced padding, which are fair points. However, as long as it fits your device, it’s likely to be a worthwhile investment.

**Competitive Options**  
Comparing the Wanty Wanty to other covers in the same space, it holds its ground well. Some alternatives, like generic fabric covers, lack the water-resistance and antistatic properties this one provides. On the flip side, premium covers from top-tier brands often come with features like built-in zippers or reinforced edges, though they’re generally pricier. If you’re looking for a balance between affordability and functionality, this product is hard to beat.

**Quality for Price**  
When it comes to getting your money’s worth, this product ticks many boxes. It’s budget-friendly without compromising on essential features. Sure, it might not have every bell and whistle, but it provides reliable protection at a reasonable price point. For professionals like me, who need to keep expensive office equipment in good shape, it’s definitely a smart purchase.

Coffee in one hand, phone in the other, always pushing through, always “on.” Rest feels like laziness. But here’s the truth: when you don’t give your body rest, it will eventually take it on its own terms. And trust me, that’s never convenient.

At first, the warning signs are small. You’re tired all the time, even after a full night’s sleep. You snap at people for little things. Your brain feels foggy, like you’re wading through oatmeal. That’s your body whispering, “Hey, slow down. I need a break.”

Most of us ignore those whispers. We reach for more caffeine, push through another meeting, stay up too late finishing tasks.

Ignore the whispers long enough, and your body starts yelling:

* **You get sick more often** — your immune system can’t keep up.
* **You lose focus** — even simple tasks feel overwhelming.
* **Anxiety climbs, creativity drops** — stress takes over.
* **Burnout sets in** — your body’s way of saying, *“I can’t keep up with this pace.”*

# The Forced Shutdowns

If you still don’t listen, your body takes matters into its own hands.

Your brain literally forces you into tiny seconds of sleep, even if you’re driving or working.

You may crash hard and sleep longer than you meant to, no matter the deadlines.

Some people experience confusion, blackouts, or hallucinations after severe lack of rest.

In extreme cases people have suffered heart attacks or strokes simply because they never gave themselves a pause. That’s not “hustle culture,” that’s tragedy.

# A Real-World Example: The Biggest Loser

If you remember the reality show *The Biggest Loser*, contestants were often pushed to the breaking point with nonstop workouts and very low-calorie diets. Rest was almost an afterthought. The results weren’t pretty: people were vomiting on camera, collapsing from exhaustion, and in some cases, their bodies literally shut down.

Doctors later criticized the show for pushing contestants too hard without giving their bodies time to recover. Some participants reported long-term damage to their metabolism and overall health. That’s a perfect example of what happens when you treat the body like a machine instead of something that needs balance, rest, and repair.

# Why Rest Is Not Lazy

We’ve been taught to see rest as wasted time, but really, rest is fuel. Sleep and downtime repair your brain, balance your hormones, strengthen your immune system, and even make you more creative. Without it, your productivity drops anyway. So, you’re not saving time by skipping rest — you’re losing it in the long run.

Rest doesn’t have to mean doing nothing all day. It can be simple:

* **Unplug from work one day a week** — give your mind and body space to reset.
* **Nap without guilt** — rest isn’t wasted time, it’s recovery.
* **Take it slow** — go for a walk, cook a meal, or simply enjoy time with family.
* **Say “no” when it’s too much** — listening to your body is part of lasting health.

It’s not about being lazy — it’s about lasting.

Here’s the reality: you can either schedule rest into your life, or your body will schedule it for you — and that usually comes in the form of sickness, burnout, or collapse.

So next time you’re tempted to push through “just one more thing,” remember this: **rest is not selfish. Rest is survival.**",1,1755448091.0,u_Specialist-One-8047,0,1.0,False
1msveha,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1msveha/assess_inwaysin_4_gallon_trash_bags_are_they/,Assess Inwaysin 4 Gallon Trash Bags Are They Really Leak Proof,"Using the Inwaysin 4 Gallon Trash Bag daily has been surprisingly convenient and also a little enlightening. When I first got my hands on this product, I wasn’t entirely convinced that a trash bag could make much of a difference in my day-to-day life. But after weeks of putting these biodegradable, ultra-thick liners to the test, I can confidently say they’ve earned their place in my household. From the bathroom to the kitchen, this product has been pitted against a variety of sticky, messy, and downright challenging situations, and yet, it has mostly delivered.

**Eco-Friendly and Biodegradable Design**

What immediately caught my attention was the biodegradable element of these bags. Knowing that these liners are made of eco-friendly, EPI-certified materials made me feel a tad less guilty about tossing out my trash. It’s a small but meaningful step towards reducing white pollution, and I think it’s a significant point in favor of this product. The translucent design is another plus; it makes sorting recyclables and general waste a lot more straightforward. My kids have even started to get the hang of separating their trash thanks to this feature. Sometimes it’s the small details that make a big difference.

**Thick and Reliable Bags—No More Leakage Drama**

Thin trash bags are the worst. They tear at the most inconvenient times, usually when I’m trying to get rid of something nasty, like kitchen food waste or baby diapers. One of the standout pros of these small garbage bags is their thickness and durability. The enhanced octangle star-sealed bottom is an innovative touch, preventing leaks even when the content is wetter than you’d like to admit. I dumped a mix of coffee grounds and leftover soup into one of these liners as a real test, and it held up well—no tears, no leaks. Just don’t throw in anything super sharp unless you’re ready for a mess.

**Tear-Away Perforation Simplifies Storage**

Tearing a bag off the roll can sometimes turn into a battle. Thankfully, the perforations on these liners are excellent. With just one quick tug, you have a bag ready to go without the annoyance of accidentally grabbing three extra. It’s not a revolutionary feature, but it saves time and effort when you’re halfway through a chaotic kitchen cleanup. The compact packaging design is another highlight—it keeps the rolls neat and fits perfectly in my cleaning drawer.

**Versatility Across Different Spaces**

These bags are not restricted to one purpose, which I love. From the 4-gallon-sized wastebasket in the bathroom to the small trash can in my car, they fit multiple spots perfectly. They’re even useful beyond trash collection. I’ve stashed old clothes in them while reorganizing my wardrobe and used them to pack baby blankets for storage. My coworker claims she uses them for pet waste, and they work equally well for that purpose. Multifunctional items like this are always a win in my book.

**Advantages**

- Made from eco-friendly, biodegradable materials
- Strong and leak-proof with thick construction
- Perfect size for most small trash bins
- Convenient perforations for easy tearing and use

**Shortcomings**

- Not suitable for very sharp objects
- The lack of a scent might not appeal to users dealing with odor-heavy trash

**Competitors**

In the increasingly competitive trash bag market, there are plenty of alternatives to consider. EarthSense has a line of biodegradable trash bags with equally impressive environmental credentials, but they are a touch more expensive and tend to tear easily under heavy loads. On the other hand, Glad’s small trash bags bring scented options to the table, which is a bonus for those actively tackling bad odors. However, their synthetic makeup might not be the best choice for eco-conscious users. Compared to these brands, the Inwaysin trash bags strike a good balance between strength, eco-friendliness, and versatility.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Budget-friendly products are great, but they’d better perform well to justify spending money on them. From what I experienced, these small garbage bags balance affordability with functionality. Their durability means you rarely experience double-bagging scenarios, saving you money over time. Add the eco-friendly component, and these bags feel like a smart purchase. Though they might appear comparable in price to their mainstream competitors, the convenience and added features make them worth the investment.

Since then I've been single for all of this year, instead focusing on improving my mental and physical health so I can be better than ever before.

Recently I went on a few dates with a girl and they went okay but I broke it off deciding it wouldn't work best as a long term thing. 

Now today I've walked past my ex (she was a lot further away but I recognised her and we saw eachother). And all of a sudden I feel...Off. 

While being single didn't bother me much before, it all of a sudden bugs me now. Now I'm very worried that all this effort I've put into improving has been...Wasted? Like, whats the point in bettering myself if I'm just gonna feel awful when I see my ex? 

And not only that but getting into dating itself is tough as hell! Like, my ex approached me and so I knew she must've liked me so I was fine to reciprocate those feelings. But what about in public? 

Like, I go out to singles nights, I've tried dating apps but they're not really for me. And I always think, well some people meet at coffee shops, the gym and places like that. But to me that seems so risky! Like, what if they're dating someone, what if they're asexual or maybe gay, or if they're just not interested. Then that makes me some guy who just disturbed and made them feel uncomfortable for no reason at all. ;-;

We hit it off right away. We opened up quickly about life, struggles, goals, and I eventually met many of his friends and family. It genuinely felt like we were building a solid, meaningful friendship.

Over time, though, I noticed how rigid and argumentative he could be. Conversations often felt like debates (even when they didn’t need to be) and he always had to be right. Still, I supported him a lot. I gave him relationship advice, career tips, and tried to be there when he needed someone. I honestly thought the support went both ways.

We got into a conversation about politics. He told me he was a DJT supporter and asked about my views, and I said I leaned Democrat. His response was, “That’s probably just because of your dad.” I explained that while my upbringing influenced me, my beliefs are still my own. He laughed and said, “How much?” I told him I didn’t want to quantify it, but he insisted, saying, “I’m going to assume a lot then” and then started trying to convince me that I actually agree with him more than I realize. It didn’t feel like a respectful conversation (it felt like he was trying to invalidate my stance and manipulate the direction of the discussion).

The next day, I texted him and said I didn’t appreciate the way he dismissed my views and made assumptions about me. I said an apology would suffice, not in a confrontational way, just to express that I felt disrespected.

He said he doesn’t like texting and preferred to talk in person. When we met up, I bought him a coffee at Starbucks and we sat down on a sofa and the whole thing exploded. He said I was trying to bring him down to my level, accused me of having low self-esteem, called me controlling and untrustworthy, sounded like the devil and said I “love conflict"" and even said I was bullying him at a moment. It felt like he was unloading a bunch of resentment and going straight for personal attacks. I was stunned. I reminded him how much I’d supported him in the past (not to guilt him, just to show that I’ve always acted in good faith). He accused me of being manipulative and trying to make him feel bad for me.

He ended the conversation by saying, “This friendship is over,” and insisted on doing a prayer with me and I declined respectfully saying it wasn't about that. He got up and told me to hug him which I also declined but extended my hand to shake and he shook it then walked away.

Afterward, I sent him one last message and blocked him:

“I don’t feel bad about myself, Charles, nor do I have low self-esteem. I’m okay the way I am—even better than some people, to be honest.What really bothered me was how you turned a simple request into a character assassination.People make mistakes, including you—you even joke about them sometimes. But today you took things to a different level, throwing insults at me non-stop.I don’t deserve that kind of treatment. I’m not interested in being friends after this. Ciao for now.”

As Dakota’ was Lying there in her Bed, lying there with her head pressed firmly up against her pillow. As her hands began to slowly tighten up on the blanket that was covering her. Thinking to herself “ Do I really want to do this, I mean do I really want to do this today” Just as the days first light began making its way through the bedroom window looking at Dakota’ in its own way of Saying to her “ You know that you can do this, let me guide the way for you on this day” letting her know that a new day was here for her, that a new day was upon her. 

Promising her that today was going to be different, as Dakota’ continued to lay there gripping her pillow even tighter trying to fight back the tears. Saying out loud “ Sure! Like I’ve heard that one before, omg! Would someone just end it for me! Please! Could someone just end it all for me now! Just please Tell me something that I haven’t already heard before!” 

Lying there in her bed as tears fell from her down upon her pillow, for Dakota’ knew that this day was just not going to be easy. Not easy at all for her today 

As she then placed her pillow over head saying “ Look! Please Just let me stay in bed today! I beg you! Just please let me stay in bed today! Just don’t do this to me! Not today!” 

But as the mornings sunlight was trying to tell her in its way, that there was a place still in this life for her. As Dakota’ then set up in her bed. Setting there looking out of the window to yet an another day. Another day of “I can’t do this! I just can’t! Not today! Just go away!” Setting there asking herself! 

“What has life got to give me today? Is there even a place here in this life for me? Omg! I’m just not ready for today!”

With her not knowing then, that later on she would realize that there is a place in this life for her. But at the same time leaving her asking the question? “why isn’t there a place in life for everyone? Then! Would you or someone please tell me that! Please tell me that”

Thinking to herself as she looked out of her window just as the sun’s light glimmered through. Glimmering its light through and around the branches of the tree that stood just outside of her window. Watching as the wind would blow through its leaves just as the sun was trying to tell her yet again! Trying to tell her that today was going to be different. With Dakota’ now saying “Okay! You win! I’m getting up! But that doesn’t mean that I have to like it”

With Dakota’ now making her way out of bed saying to herself! “Man! I’m feeling like the world’s oldest 31 year old!” But just as that thought had left her. The quietness of the morning was being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids.  Walking by her window making their way to a nearby school. With Dakota’ then saying! “Oh come on! Can’t you kids be any louder! Omg! I’m now starting to sound like my mother!” As another tear fell from her

As Dakota’ stood there looking out seeing and hearing the kids as they walked by. Knowing that the sounds was just not going away anytime soon! Slowly! But surely making her way to the bathroom standing there in front of the mirror looking. As Dakota’ the said “Jesus! I’m just not ready for today! Jesus! If you are up there listening! I’m going to all the help that I can get today! If you are listening! Listening to a 31 something year old girl! Stand here and complain! Yeah! like my everyday complaining!” 

Standing there running her hand back through her usual messed up blonde hair. Standing there looking into the mirror, looking at a blonde haired blue eyed girl! thinking to herself “Oh yeah! I am sure ready for today!” As Dakota’ stood there messing up her hair even more! Saying to herself! “ Yeah! This girl is certainly going places! Just not today! I mean! What more could a blue eyed girl do to get through yet another day. I mean if you are listening! Then please tell me”

As Dakota’ just stood there screaming into the mirror! Pulling her hair in every direction! Except where she wanted it to go! Saying to herself! 

 “Oh yeah! Another day of let’s see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself!” standing there in the bathroom now trying to put her clothes on! With her now screaming! Saying! “Oh my God! One pants leg at a time! Jesus! I swear! I’m thinking that! I’m really thinking about just stripping everything off and just!” Screaming as she finally finished putting her clothes on asking herself yet again!

“ Do I really want to do this? Do I really want this day to even be here” 

With Dakota’ now making her way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Saying to herself! “ Oh yeah! Just what this girl needed this morning. “ My cup of hot Joe!” With her not really knowing where to start! Or he’ll! even to begin! But first things first, Her Coffee, For she just wasn’t doing nothing or? until she has had her first mornings coffee. With Dakota’ now settling down at the kitchen table looking at the mornings newspaper along with her coffee. 

Saying to herself! “Well! Let’s see what is happening in the world today! Who is here! And who is not!” Setting there as she flipped through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what else the world may have to look forward to. Throwing the newspaper to the side thinking to herself saying 

“ Nothing! Nothing else is happening I guess! I mean is there anything left in this Life!” Thinking to herself was there any faith left in her at all”

Knowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing her things before heading out the door. She then noticed that her coat was still hanging in the closet. Saying to herself in the process! “I swear if my head wasn’t attached to me!” dropping her purse back onto the kitchen table. Saying to herself! 

“My head would still in the bed asleep it if we’re not attached to me” 

Doing a complete 180 making her way back into her room opening up her closet door reaching for it screaming 

“Oh my God! Now where in the hell is it!”

And that was when she then noticed a box setting there in the corner, from just out of shear curiosity she then reached it grabbing it. Now trying to get her own self from out of the closet saying to herself in the process. “ Omg! Jesus! I swear this closet is going to be the end of me yet!”

Walking back into the kitchen holding the while dragging her coat along with her placing both of them down onto the kitchen table. Not knowing of what she would even find in it as she set down ready to open this bad boy up! And with both look of what is it! And then! Memories! Memories that would bring her to rediscovering the past in her life. A past that would bring her to finding something that was missing from her life. 

 Dakota’ just didn’t realize it at the moment. That It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter. With one of the photos being of her mom setting there looking to the photo of her mom. With Dakota’ knowing that she was not always very close to her mom! But  it would still bring a tear her eyes! 

But It didn’t seem to make her day any better at the moment! Knowing that for today marked ten years since her mom had passed away. And with her going to visit her grave today it just didn’t make it easier. Seeing that photo of her mom! As Dakota’ then picked up another photo! the memories of yesterday hit her even harder! As she looked closely at the photo. Looking at a younger her! A young Girl of around 12 years of age! with her short blonde hair standing there next to her mother.

 Who was next to identical to her! Looking at the photo setting there beside her was her dog, a dog who was named Buddy. Thinking back she remembered the good times that they had with her dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don’t realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.

And that was when Dakota’ found the letter, a letter that she had not seen before today. Setting there thinking to herself that reading it would not make her day any easier. But read it she did! for the letter read as this, 

“. To my lovely Daughter Dakota’ I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize that the hard times and the good times that we had shared together.”

“For no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl! my little Dakota! knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself”

“That no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life. 

Leaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found that day! think back! Back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer on what you found, on what Life had brought to you that summer! just before your teenage Life was just about to begin. 

For when you find it again! You just know that as your mother! A place I have found! A place that i hope you will find too. Knowing that the people you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.”

Reading that then sent Dakota’s mind racing! Racing back to that day! thinking on everything that the day would bring back to her! But little did Dakota’ know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that she would have never knew! For someone it would bring her to that day.

As Dakota’ set there remembering back! Remembering It was early that morning when she had got up. not wanting to get out bed! Sounds familiar! just as her dog buddy would then come running! Jumping up onto Dakota’s bed licking her face making himself known in his way! Of telling Dakota’ that was his way! Only the way that her little buddy could do! Letting her know that another day was here! Another day of exploring together. to find themselves wondering out! And into a world that only their imagination could take them!

Giving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as Dakota’ got out of bed walking into the kitchen as her mom was making breakfast. Saying to her

“Now what would my little Dakota’ like this morning!” As Dakota’s mom then looked to buddy saying! “Oh and what would a good little boy like yourself like!” Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying 

“ maybe later I’m not hungry right now” 

for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before. But before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying 

“Honey I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!” 

jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying 

“ look mom not now I just want to just go! So look I will be back later” 

Making my way out the door as looking back at my mom saying 

“ look I will be back later till then just chilling okay!” 

Walking out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret! Regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.

 But now a journey awaited me! A journey that would in time change my Life forever, forever in a way that I was soon to find out. Setting there on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself

 “what else is out there? What else is out there for us buddy!” I mean What else was there for me in this life.” Looking down to buddy saying to him 

“ let’s go and find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here” 

With that I stood up saying to buddy

 “ let’s go! Let’s do this! Let’s see for ourselves what else is out there” 

walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line thinking to myself “once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us!” Jumping the fence me and buddy then made our way to the road with my house now out of sight. I knew now! That from this point on! That we were on our own! On our way! And with that we were on our way! Aldo on our own! “Okay! So I already mentioned that we were on our own now! But To where? I did not know! But we sure were going to find out when got there! 

As we walked down the dirt road a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road. Seeing a red farm truck parked there! Parked on the side other side of the gas station kinda away from everyone! quickly grabbing buddy running up to the truck climbing onto the tailgate. 

As me and buddy lay there! Down inside the back of the pickup! Making sure that know one saw us! Thinking! “Yeah! me and buddy where on our way! On our way to where? Well we were about to find out!” As we lay there in the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner. Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over quickly covering myself and buddy up. As we both lay there! Trying my best making sure that buddy wasn’t going to be buddy! And start barking! 

Letting half of the world know that we were there! For it wasn’t long till I then heard the owner getting back into the truck! Quickly making sure that no one noticed us. With him now Pulling out of the gas station as I then looked to buddy saying

“Woohoo we are on our way now!”

Feeling the wind as it hit up against the blanket laying there as we made our way down the road. It wasn’t until about fifteen minutes later! uncovering myself and buddy! Making sure that buddy wasn’t going to be quiet! setting up looking out into the empty fields as we passed by them. Feeling the freedom of the wind making our way down the road. At the same time making sure that the driver didn’t see us.  

For our little adventure would have ended very quickly! Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing! Saying to him with a smile 

“ Look! I know what you would say if you could talk! But  I know what I am doing! Really!”

looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road. I thought to myself

“what were we going to do when we got there? Where were we going to go?” 

About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us! With the driver now pulling into the parking lot of the grocery store. Quickly lying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Lying there waiting! Once again making sure that buddy was not going to be buddy! “Now remember no barking!” 

With me now hearing the truck door open as the driver then got out. Upon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear. Double checking! Looking all around before uncovering myself and buddy! Quickly double checking with buddy! “You think it’s clear now! You sure it’s clear!” As buddy then just bark at me! 

With me looking to him saying to him “Hey I know what I’m doing! Okay! Got it! Good! Now let’s go!” making our way from the truck not looking back until we were far enough away. Looking out across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.

 As we then walked from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk. As people would pass us by! Not paying any real attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves until we then came across a gentleman. He was just setting there on a bench in front of a the convenient store whittling away on a piece of wood. Just as he then Look up at me saying 

“Well hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you” 

Saying back to him 

“Thank you! His name is buddy! my mom got him from the pound” 

Smiling back to me! He then asked me saying 

“So where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask”

Replying back to him I said to him 

“Just seeing what a girl and her dog could find on our way! On our little adventure finding out what life has for us”

Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us 

“ finding yourself on an adventure! Why aren’t you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you”? 

“Maybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for! And then when are old enough you can go all of the adventures you like!”

“Then maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.” 

As he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying with him. A drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying 

“ Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way! “

“But just know this little one! The memories that you make as a child! Are the memories that will keep you going! When this little thing that we adults like to call life! When Life just steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep.“ 

thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy then made our way down the street I didn’t know then what he said as I would later in my Life what he meant.

As the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We then came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on us we decided to make camp there for the night Just. Having no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me. 

Thinking to myself! Thinking about my mom! Was she missing me? What was she doing? As I lay there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As lay there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me. 

Soon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would then fall to sleep. For that night finding myself dreaming! Dreaming of myself and buddy! With the two of us being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. 

“ You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there! Someone has a plan for you in this Life”.

 “For everyone that you meet in this Life! Will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or in your memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life” 

As I then Dreamed! I then Dreamed of mom. And In my dream she was crying, crying for me to come home! saying to me 

“ please Dakota’ just come home wherever you are, please just come back to me” 

With me and buddy waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.

With me and buddy now making our way across the field thinking about the journey ahead! The journey would take us to where we were going. Only problem was! That we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way! With me looking down to buddy asking him! “Tell me buddy! Where are we going!” 

Just as buddy just barked at me! With us now spending most of the day keeping in the field. Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road. Looking around I could see an individual standing there in a field across the road in another field. He was just standing there not really knowing on why he was just standing there at the moment. But soon I was going to find out! 

Thinking to myself we could just sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up to the truck climbing over the tailgate before the individual saw us. It wasn’t maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. 

Lying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we were going. Lying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as lay there watching the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. 

I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in this Life. A place that I knew I belonged there! But till then as I lay there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by looking to buddy saying 

“We are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in this Life.”

As the day went by further down the road finding ourselves lying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky just coming into view. Just as we made our way down the highway thirsty and hungry I felt lying there in the bed of pickup. For I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as we passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.

 I found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world. A world that I was not for sure off! A world that just seemed distant! A world that in time! I would come to know that this was my life! As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her.

“Wait mom! Please come back! Please where are you going “ 

Turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying 

“ I love you Dakota! I love you wherever your are” 

With that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself 

“What have I done? What have I done to my mom?”

Just as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Lying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up. 

But before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me 

“What in Gods name! I can’t even believe to what I am seeing!”

Looking at me with a very stunned with a  surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying

 “You have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there” 

Climbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my buddy’s journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said to him

“yes very much so”

 After me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would soon arrive. But then as I heard a voice! A voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me lying there in bed looking at him  saying 

“Hello“

Looking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me 

“Who are you” 

I replied to him saying 

“ I am Dakota and what is your name” 

As he then spoke bake to me saying 

“My name is Billy” 

Walking closer o him I could see that he was sick as he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next to him. Standing there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying 

“The Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer! And that it may take awhile for me to get better” 

But Just then as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy. As I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile 

“ its okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?” With buddy barking to him licking his face! 

Replying to him saying! yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me 

“A journey! 

“Man! I would love very much to go on a journey someday! A journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed” 

Looking to Billy I said to him 

“Maybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey, maybe you me and buddy could go on a journey together”

Smiling to me saying 

“Man that would be great going on a journey”

“I would love nothing but to find myself on an adventure one day!”

With Billy just looking at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me 

“ I want to so bad to find my place in this Life!  I want to just get up from here and go live my Life.”

“But hearing it in my mom and dad’s voice! I can hear them saying that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life”

Just then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him 

“ I hope that one day that you will get better and just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together” 

As Billy then gave buddy one last hug looking at him smiling petting him one last time before we made my our way to front door. To where the authorities were waiting there to take me and buddy back home.

 As we then made our way back home from our little journey pulling back into the drive way! Finding ourselves now back at our farm. I could see my mom as she came running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me 

“Don’t you ever leave me again Dakota! Don’t you ever leave like that again me again” 

hugging my mom saying to her

 “I promise mom I will never leave you again” 

For as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy’ and Journey that me and buddy had went on that day. Thinking to myself settling there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me. Looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me. As she then placed her arms around me with tears in her eyes! 

 Telling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Saying to my mom

“Why! Billy’ can’t die! He was going to get better! So me him and buddy could go on a journey together”

But Just knowing that my mom was setting there with me giving me a hug saying to me 

“Honey I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.” 

For the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.

Looking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom’s letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.

 Thinking of the gentleman that I had met on my journey with buddy that day! And that he was right! When he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood! Are the memories that help us get through our Life as adults today. 

And on that day as I stood there at my mom’s grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy’ so many years ago! What he said to me! For there was a place for him in this life! And for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dad’s memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me. 

For me to grow! To appreciate the Life that I had! For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. 

For There was a place! A Place In Heaven

1msv8n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1msv8n8/f23_f20_longdistance_made_our_differences_obvious/,"(F23 & F20) Long-distance made our differences obvious. Back together in September, keep trying or cut losses?","TL;DR
Me F23, her F20. Dating since April; summer long-distance exposed mismatches (her partying/blackout drinking/“IRL dating app” club vs my need for basic updates and frequent texting). We won’t be long-distance in September, but I’m worried that just postpones the issue: boundaries vs incompatibility?

We started dating in April and things were great. Since June we’re long-distance and I’m noticing incompatibilities (her social life/boundaries, my communication needs). I like her a lot but I’m not sure if this is fixable or just who we are.

We study at the same university. Until mid-June we were basically together every day, except when she went home. I met some of her friends and things were pretty much okay. Summer break started, I returned to my hometown, and we became long-distance. At first it was fine, but I started noticing differences that made me uncomfortable. We won’t be long-distance again in September, but I’m suspicious this will be a temporary fix and not a real solution, more like postponing the problem.

When we met, she told me she was heterosexual. A month later she said “I was wrong” and that she likes me back. I guess I’m still not fully comfortable with the fact that before me she was only into boys. I’m also her first partner (she’s had crushes and rejected some people before).

She has a high school friend group (like 8–9 people). These are the friends I met. The thing is, I couldn’t get myself to like them, which is okay, but I’m not used to that. In my previous relationships my partners had a few close friends and I usually liked them. Now I felt judged by 8 people simultaneously.

One of them came back from studying abroad for summer. He’s a single cishet male and apparently the only single person in the group. He also happens to be my girlfriend’s second-closest friend. Because of her recent coming out, I felt uneasy about him. He seemed like an okay guy tbh, just a bit silly, not malicious. But then my gf started talking about him often, random stuff like “he didn’t know spiders aren’t insects.” Harmless, but it made me uncomfortable. I finally asked if she liked him back in high school; she said no, never, and I believe her.

She hangs out with this group relatively often. That’s fine, but the settings are not what I’m used to. My previous partners went out with girl friends to shop or grab coffee. My partner likes concerts or drinking with them. I tried to be okay with it, maybe that’s how she recharges.

She’s also explicitly mentioned things she’s open to:
	•	Going on a vacation with her friends, or staying at her friends’ places -> I can understand these even if I wouldn’t do them.
	•	Going to this one specific club (it’s basically an IRL dating app) with her friends -> this feels questionable to me.
	•	Getting blackout drunk (she said she’s done it a few times and would be open to it again even if I’m not there) -> I don’t want my partner to do this.

I think it’s understandable why someone wouldn’t like their partner to be blackout drunk when they’re not around. Her reaction was, “So I should drink 2 beers because you don’t want me to drink?” To me there’s a big gap between telling someone not to pass out and telling them to only drink 2 beers.

I’m someone who likes to text often. I’ll text that I’m making a meal, that my cat did a funny thing, or just a random “how are you feeling?” I think she’s used to being single and not telling people what she’s doing. At first, when she went out, she didn’t even send “I arrived” or “I’m heading back,” which I think is the basic minimum. I told her I don’t need her to text a lot when she’s out with her friends, but some basic messages would be nice. She’s shown some improvement, though not perfect.

We had some serious arguments. I like open communication, being in contact often, having a small circle, and not changing plans last minute. She didn’t tell me for months that I was making her feel restricted, even though I asked every few weeks if anything was bothering her. For me, being in contact often and having a small circle = safety, calmness, a non-clustered, serene life. For her, a big friend circle, being able to change plans, and not having to update me on everything = freedom.

I genuinely believe I haven’t restricted her beyond showing discomfort from time to time, usually when we planned something and then a friend asked her out and she said yes. I never told her not to see her friends or not to do things in general. It’s also not like I’m asking her not to do things that I do myself. So I don’t think I’m being hypocritical. We just have different ways of living.

We agreed to try more to close the gap. I’m not super hopeful because some of this feels fundamental. But I genuinely like her. I still have the spark when I see her, I giggle at her photos, and I don’t want to give up.

What do I do? How do I handle these differences (friends/partying/blackout drinking/that club + communication frequency) without feeling controlling? Where’s the line between reasonable boundaries vs. incompatibility? Any advice or perspectives are appreciated.",1,1755447696.0,LesbianActually,1,1.0,False
1msv8d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1msv8d7/super_weird_dream/,Super weird dream,"So basically, I just had coffee and decided to take a nap, which is never a good idea because that's when I have the weirdest dreams, but I feel like this one has some kind of meaning because I've had it before. 

Anyway, I think I was in a super old fashioned house for some reason, being chased and stalked by a man who had powers associated with mirrors. I don't remember exactly what the powers were, but I knew he could move through mirrors to get anywhere in the house, and I kept having to hide from him. I understood him to be the personification of fear, specifically my fear, for some reason. 

There was also a kind of side plot to the dream, where there was a boy who in the world of the dream, was my childhood friend who kept trying to get me to come out of the house and join him, but I couldn't. I don't have any childhood friends, so that's something completely made up by the dream. 

I finally woke up when I escaped the house, still being chased by the man after I'd broken a mirror. Like I said, it's not the first time I've had this dream, except the boy is new and before it was just me running from the man. I feel like it has some kind of meaning, I just don't know what it is, so any help is appreciated, otherwise this is just going to bother me all day. Thanks! ",1,1755447678.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

1msv83v,https://v.redd.it/grvgjxyorljf1,A fun repeater trick with the MK1 Asterisk.,"It's been one of those BS kind of mornings that started out with a trip to the urgent care because I'm a stubborn old fart.

So my only intention for the rest of my Sunday is to sit in the shade, drink coffee, and do some throwing. 

I picked up the MK1 Asterisk a few weeks ago and can't put it down.  It has that classic shape and feel. I've become an absolute sucker for hybrid lately, and this one packs a lot of punch.  So stop by YoyoSam and check them out (don't forget to use my 10% off discount code (dadjoke)).

The trick is a simple repeater I whipped up.  It's nothing fancy, but it fits my current mood.

As I don't have friends there so mostly ghumna firna family and cousins k saath he raha hai. And honestly they're too gwalior typical (I mean don't get me wrong but I don't vibe with them) they're more like local and from nearby places so unke interests bhi okay okay hain and I'm kinda genz and very upto date with pop culture. So I want to know some cool places where i can go solo. Maybe for a coffee or maybe can do any activity solo ??? Just need some good environment and a good crowd not the typical gwalior wala crowd.
