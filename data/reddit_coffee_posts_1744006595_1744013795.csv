Reading this sub has us excited but a bit overwhelmed with the choices. We want a hotel with western beds that is on the beach, preferably in a quieter area but still with a couple bars/coffee shops/restaurants that are walkable. We will want to scuba diver 2-3 days (have advanced certs), golf 0-2 times (high handicappers who prefer more relaxed courses), and mostly just relaxing in a shaded cabana on the ocean. 

We won’t have a car so the main island/naha seems less ideal reading posts here and will prefer to stay in one place vs island hop. Tokashiki doesn’t appear to have golf. Ishigaki seems to hit all the marks (flying out on Jin air) with an option like ANA InterContinental Ishigaki Resort but they only have a 10-hole course on site.

1jtg6vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1jtg6vg/friendship_breakups_are_bizarre_in_most/,Friendship breakups are bizarre in most circumstances,"There was a post on AIO (I don't follow the sub, it popped up in popular section) where an 18 year old pregnant girl gets ""friend dumped"" by another girl because she's pregnant. I thought the conversation was bizarre and extremely rude, but most posts agreed with the friend. 

I don't want or even like kids, but I found the need for this totally absurd. So what if they have different lifestyles, let things fade out if she can't find time to socialize. But why the preemptive break up is needed is just weird. I also noticed in general that people seem to support this as good communication which makes no sense, naturally fading out if that's what happens (without overthinking it) is the most normal course of action.

I understand friendships that break over an obvious cause, e.g. the friend did something to you or it turns out they are a mass murderer - in that case, no explanation is even needed. But if you're friendly with someone, and currently your lifestyles are a bit different, one of you has less time etc, what is the point in saying anything? I'd rather just let things take natural course and who knows, maybe 6 years later we'll reconnect. I wasn't close to any of my high school friends for years and then suddenly we started to reconnect (sometimes by just running into each other) and found we actually still like each other and have fun talking to each other. Now we're all solid.


I also don't get people thinking they need to have identical lifestyles and interests. That whole thread made friendships sound super transactional, but it's not the first or only time I've been seeing such sentiment. It's not like everyone only does one thing. I mean sure, I liked going out and drinking - I still sometimes do. I also like meeting friends for coffee or catching a movie, or going for a walk or playing a game... It's not as if you need to do the same thing with everyone all the time. You can have friends you see a lot, and friends you see a few times a year for different reasons, and yet still enjoy catching up. 

I also want to add that having different lifestyles to me can be pretty interesting, I usually talk to my friends, and interesting people talk about things interestingly - it can be cool to learn about things I have no experience with and vice versa. 

Even more baffling was the ""moral"" argument where you yourself think a friend is a bad influence because they made personally bad choices - I don't even know what to comment here, do you think of yourself as if you're 5? I never in my life heard about having to share life goals with friends, what the hell is that concept?

And in a scenario where you just don't like a person anymore and have nothing to talk to them about, but they still want to hang out, I'd just ice it unless they specifically ask about the issue, and even then I'd play it off as being busy unless I feel there's something they should really know about themselves. Anything else is just weird. I know redditors think everything needs to be communicated, but no",1,1744013617.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,0,1.0,False

Their ability to control sound reverberation, create privacy, and enhance the overall ambience of a room has made them an integral part of modern interiors — from workspaces to auditoriums and residential zones. But while the benefits of these panels are well established, what often goes unnoticed is how simple care and maintenance can preserve their original charm for years to come.

This guide is tailored for those who want to keep their **Acoustic Boards For Walls** in top condition, not just for their acoustic performance, but also for their visual appeal. Let’s delve into the essentials of care that ensure your investment continues to deliver — both in form and function.

# Understanding the Nature of Acoustic Wall Panels

Before we jump into care routines, it helps to understand what makes **Acoustic Wall Panels** so unique. These panels are often constructed using materials like PET fiber, fiberglass, wood wool, or foam, each chosen for its sound absorption properties and ease of customization. Surface textures can vary from smooth and sleek to patterned and fabric-wrapped — which means cleaning and maintaining them requires attention to material-specific needs.

# Dusting — The First Line of Defense

Dust can be the silent enemy. Over time, it can settle into the fibers and textures of [Acoustic Board Panels,](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/fiberglass-acoustical-panels/fibreglass-acoustic-ceilings-panels.html) dulling their appearance and even reducing their effectiveness by clogging sound-absorbing pores.

A simple feather duster or microfiber cloth used weekly can work wonders. For fabric-faced **Acoustic Boards**, a handheld vacuum with a soft brush attachment is even better. Just make sure the suction is gentle to avoid deforming the material. If panels are located in high-traffic or dust-prone areas — such as schools or commercial spaces — this step becomes all the more critical.

# Gentle Spot Cleaning

Despite best efforts, accidents happen. Whether it's a coffee splash in a conference room or a child's paint smudge in a learning environment, stains can find their way onto your **Acoustic Boards For Walls**.

Spot cleaning is your go-to solution here. Use a mild detergent diluted in lukewarm water and gently blot the stained area with a clean sponge or cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive scrubs that could damage the panel surface. Always test on a small inconspicuous area first, especially for fabric-finished [Acoustic Wall Panels](https://www.tranquilglobal.com/acoustics/pet-acoustic-panels.html).

Remember: blot, don’t rub. Rubbing might push the stain deeper into the panel and distort its texture.

# Managing Humidity and Temperature

Though many **Acoustic Boards** are engineered to be durable, extreme humidity or temperature changes can affect their structure. Warping, discoloration, or mildew growth can occur if panels are installed in improperly ventilated spaces.

To prevent this, maintain indoor conditions within moderate levels. Use dehumidifiers in moisture-rich environments and ensure HVAC systems are functioning optimally. It’s a subtle but powerful way to protect your **Acoustic Board Panels** from long-term damage.

# Preventing Physical Damage

Unlike regular wall finishes, **Acoustic Wall Panels** are not designed to take physical abuse. Sharp objects, rough handling, or even heavy contact can dent or tear the surface. Establish basic guidelines, especially in shared environments — such as office break rooms or classrooms — to avoid leaning furniture or heavy items directly against the panels.

Wherever possible, install the panels slightly elevated from the floor to protect against accidental kicks or mop strokes during cleaning.

# Periodic Deep Cleaning

Even with regular maintenance, a more thorough cleaning every six months can help restore the original vibrancy of your **Acoustic Boards For Walls**. Depending on the material, you can either vacuum deeply (for porous surfaces) or use specialized upholstery cleaners (for fabric panels).

For larger installations or heavily used spaces, consider professional cleaning services that understand the sensitivities of **Acoustic Boards**. This ensures no harsh methods are used and the integrity of the panels is maintained.

# A Word on Color Fading and UV Exposure

One underrated factor in preserving **Acoustic Wall Panels** is protecting them from prolonged sunlight exposure. Direct UV rays can fade vibrant panel colors over time — especially in materials like dyed PET or fabric wraps.

Opt for installation away from windows, or use UV-protective films and blinds. If your panels are installed in sunlit areas, rotating or flipping them (if modular) can also help even out potential discoloration.

# Maintenance as a Design Philosophy

Good design isn’t just about the initial visual impact; it’s about how gracefully it ages. Integrating maintenance into your design plan — right from panel selection to installation — ensures that your **Acoustic Board Panels** continue to look sharp and perform efficiently over time.

Use color palettes that are forgiving to smudges and dust, consider modular panel layouts that allow for easy replacement, and engage your cleaning staff with a basic understanding of care dos and don’ts.

# Longevity Through Care, Not Just Quality

You’ve made an investment in aesthetics and acoustic performance — keeping your **Acoustic Boards** clean and fresh doesn’t need to be an overwhelming task. It’s about forming habits, not overhauls. When you treat these panels as an integral part of your space — rather than a one-time design feature — the results show not just in sound quality but in the long-lasting appeal of your interiors.",1,1744013180.0,u_tranquilindiaglobal,0,1.0,False

Oh, and I also got Botox at what would have been 4 weeks pregnant and drink a double shot coffee every morning. I have done pretty much everything you shouldn’t do (unaware).

5w2d: 5400
5w5d (hospital so different lab due to some spotting) was 6200.

Blue Puppy practiced violin like a man defusing a bomb—calmly, clinically, and with just enough flourish to make you question whether he secretly *wanted* it to go off.

His paws, gloved in worn silk that used to be ceremonial but now served mostly to keep the resin off his fur, danced along the neck of the Stradivarius. Not the *Stradivarius*, mind you—the *one* with the time-jumping core, half accident, half alchemy, and 100% in need of daily tuning lest the G string pitch him into the Napoleonic Wars. Again.

The music floated out of the study and slid down the marble halls like an old lover sneaking out with your wallet. Every note tugged the castle’s silence taut—sweet, melancholy, and just sharp enough to imply that yes, this violin had *opinions*.

Behind him, three thick stacks of paper bulged out of their folders like bureaucratic tumors: tax relief initiatives for the lumber unions of Outer Eldenhollow, a 900-year backlog of royal correspondence (including one rather eager marriage proposal from 1742), and a strongly worded letter from UNESCO questioning the legitimacy of a throne reinstated by prophecy.

A knock. Then another, slightly more impatient knock, followed by the sound of someone trying to whisper their own name through a keyhole.

“Blue? Blue Puppy? It’s Minx. I swear if you’re in there monologuing to your reflection again—”

“It’s called *sovereign meditation*, darling,” he called without turning. “And no, this time I’m playing.”

“Of course you are. Whole castle's humming like a haunted cello. The others are gathered in the war room. Or the coffee bar. I forget what you're calling it.”

He drew the bow across the strings one last time, soft and deliberate, then sighed.

“War bar. Tell them I’ll be along shortly. Just have to double-check which century we’re in.”

Minx paused, then her voice drifted in: “Still the one where we pay rent.”

He smirked.

Outside the high-arched window, Eldenhollow stretched beyond the cliffs like a stubborn dream—green hills too well-curated to be natural, stone towers that hadn’t aged in centuries because, technically, they'd been replaced every 112 years under a clause Blue Puppy wrote himself. Somewhere out there, the people still celebrated *Return Day*, waiting for their monarch to emerge again, though few believed he’d ever actually do it.

He'd left them a prophecy. A throne. A shape to grow into.

And now he was back.

He slid the Stradivarius into its vault—steel, obsidian, and something older than both—and locked it with a twist of the tail.

It had been ten years for him. A thousand for them.

He didn’t just return to power.

He’d *waited for it to arrive*.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There’s something truly enchanting about tiny houses. They come in various shapes and sizes, each reflecting unique personalities and stories. If you’re curious about what makes a tiny house special, let’s take a closer look at some of my favorite tiny houses and the standout features that give them character and charm.

One of my all-time favorite tiny houses is the ""Tumbleweed Tiny House."" This house is known for its rustic, cottage-style design that instantly creates a warm atmosphere. What sets it apart are its beautiful handcrafted wooden accents and large, inviting windows that let natural light pour in. This makes the space feel much larger than it actually is. Additionally, its functional layout includes clever storage solutions like under-the-stairs cubbies, which help keep the living area clutter-free.

Next up is the “ESCAPE Minimal Houses” series. These tiny homes are designed to be both stylish and functional. One of the standout features of these homes is their open floor plan that seamlessly merges the kitchen, dining, and living spaces. This design encourages family interaction and makes the house feel more spacious. Moreover, each ESCAPE house provides numerous windows that invite ample sunlight, promoting a connection with the outdoors, which is especially important in a tiny living space.

Another stunning example is the ""Mighty Small House"" which boasts a sleek, modern aesthetic. What I love about this tiny house is its innovative use of space. The lofted bedroom is cleverly incorporated above the kitchen, maximizing the overall floor area. Additionally, the use of mirrored surfaces creates an illusion of depth, making the tiny house feel larger. The sleek cabinetry and smart storage solutions keep everything organized and accessible, which is vital in a compact home.

If you're searching for something with a more whimsical flair, “The Hobbit House” is an absolute gem. This tiny house is inspired by the famous stories of J.R.R. Tolkien, featuring a circular door and a curved roof. The home is built partially into a hill, which not only makes it energy-efficient but also blends beautifully with the surroundings. Inside, you’ll discover cozy nooks filled with handcrafted furniture and a warm fireplace, perfect for relaxing evenings. What I appreciate most about this house is its connection to nature and the artistic element that brings a story to life.

Among tiny houses, the “Knotty Pine Cabin” stands out for its eco-friendly design. Made entirely from sustainable materials, this tiny cabin is perfect for nature lovers. The highlight of this home is its beautiful wood structure, which adds warmth and a sense of tranquility. It features large decks that extend the living space outside, making it an ideal spot for enjoying morning coffee or evening star-gazing. A tiny house like this emphasizes the importance of living in harmony with the environment.

Don’t forget about the “Mobile Tiny Home” phenomenon. These houses are on wheels, making them incredibly versatile. You can change your scenery whenever you desire. One of the coolest features is the ability to customize every aspect of your home, from the layout to the fixtures. This adaptability allows you to create your dream home that can travel with you. With efficient designs and high-quality materials, mobile tiny homes can be as cozy and luxurious as traditional houses, proving that size doesn’t equate to comfort.

Tiny houses are not just about downsizing; they are a celebration of creativity, sustainability, and unique designs. Each tiny house tells its own story through its design and features. Whether you’re drawn to rustic charm, modern minimalism, or whimsical architecture, there’s a tiny house that resonates with everyone. The special elements of these homes remind us that with creativity and thoughtful design, it’s possible to live beautifully in even the smallest of spaces.

Next time you think about tiny houses, consider the diverse styles and features that make them all unique. Each one not only provides shelter but also an inspiring lifestyle choice that blends simplicity with beauty.

The Impact of Tiny House Living on Sustainability and Minimalism
----------------------------------------------------------------

Tiny house living has gathered momentum over the past few years, becoming more than just a trend; it has evolved into a lifestyle choice for many. This minimalist approach to living directly supports sustainability while also fostering a mindset of contentment with less. If you're curious about how tiny house living intertwines with these important values, you're in the right place.

Check pricing here: https://itrendworld.com/what-are-some-of-your-favourite-tiny-houses-and-why  
  
One of the most significant impacts of tiny house living on sustainability is its reduced ecological footprint. When you downsize your living space, you naturally consume fewer resources. Smaller homes typically require less energy for heating and cooling, leading to lower utility bills and a decreased carbon footprint. Here are some noteworthy aspects:

- **Less Energy Consumption:** Tiny homes often utilize energy-efficient appliances and sustainable building materials, which helps reduce overall energy use.
- **Reduced Waste:** With less space to fill, homeowners are motivated to minimize their belongings and, in turn, their waste production.
- **Water Conservation:** Many tiny houses integrate water-saving fixtures, leading to decreased water usage, which is vital for sustainable living.

Another key impact is that tiny house living encourages people to adopt minimalism as a core principle in their lives. The philosophy behind minimalism promotes living with fewer possessions to enhance overall joy and reduce stress. When it comes to tiny homes, minimalism can significantly enhance your quality of life. This lifestyle change can help you focus on what matters most to you—relationships, experiences, and personal fulfillment. You can achieve this by following some of these strategies:

- **Prioritize Experiences:** Living in a tiny house often inspires individuals to spend more time pursuing hobbies or traveling rather than accumulating material goods.
- **Foster Mindfulness:** With fewer distractions, people find themselves more present and mindful of their everyday decisions and activities.
- **Encourage Community:** Tiny house living often attracts like-minded individuals who value community and shared experiences, which fosters deeper relationships.

Furthermore, tiny homes often embrace sustainable building practices. Many tiny house builders focus on alternative materials, like reclaimed wood, recycled metals, or even straw bales. These materials minimize the demand for new resources and help lower construction waste. Many homeowners also choose to incorporate renewable energy, such as solar panels, which can significantly diminish reliance on fossil fuels.

In addition, tiny houses frequently promote mobility, allowing residents to live in a variety of locations, often in harmony with nature. This lifestyle choice can encourage individuals to choose locations that prioritize ecological health, space for outdoor activities, and community engagement. By living this way, you can discover new places and meet new people, all while maintaining a commitment to sustainability.

Adopting tiny house living can also bring financial relief. The costs associated with purchasing and maintaining a traditional home can be overwhelming. By downsizing, individuals often find themselves with more financial freedom, allowing them to invest in experiences or save for the future. This financial aspect neatly ties back to sustainability, as it gives you the space to consider your consumption choices more critically.

Ultimately, tiny house living serves as a catalyst for positive change, promoting sustainable habits while embracing minimalism. Choosing a smaller footprint doesn't just make sense for your wallet; it empowers you to live more intentionally, aligning your actions with the values of sustainability and simplicity.

If you're considering tiny house living or simply wish to explore the philosophy behind it, the benefits are compelling. You'll not only contribute to a healthier planet, but you may also discover newfound fulfillment in your everyday life, embracing less while gaining so much more.

Ultimately, the intersection of tiny house living, sustainability, and minimalism is both profound and practical. By embracing this lifestyle, you are joining a movement that values not just living space, but the space we create in our lives to grow, connect, and thrive. It's a journey worth considering.

### Conclusion

As we’ve explored the charm of tiny houses, it’s clear that their unique features draw admiration and spark inspiration. From creative designs that optimize space to thoughtful sustainable practices, each tiny house tells a story of innovation and creativity. Whether it’s the cozy warmth of a log cabin or the sleek lines of a modern micro-home, the appeal lies in their ability to merge style with functionality.

Embracing tiny house living isn’t just about downsizing; it’s a lifestyle shift toward sustainability and minimalism. By living in smaller spaces, we naturally reduce our ecological footprints. This choice encourages us to prioritize what truly matters, leading to a more intentional way of life. You may find yourself appreciating the small joys – a cup of coffee in your snug kitchen or a peaceful evening under the stars.

Each tiny house offers a unique glimpse into what living well can mean. Through these quirky homes and their delightful features, we can be reminded of our connection to the earth, our community, and ourselves. The tiny house movement is not just a trend; it’s a reflection of a growing desire to simplify life and live in harmony with our surroundings.

1jtg08r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthi-23/comments/1jtg08r/07042025/,07/04/2025,"I haven’t journaled today. It’s just been a busy day, I guess. I woke up at 8 and tried to get a local GP appointment but there’s something wrong with the reception out here because calls keep failing? But whatsapp ones seem fine…? Touch wood. So anyway I was out on the street on hold with various GPs only for them to all turn me down. Well no, one turned me down as I wasn’t urgent which is fair enough (though the amount I’m itching does seem urgent to me but I know it isn’t *technically* urgent). The other place didn’t pick up their phone. The other place only had male doctors and I just don’t want that. So instead I went back to the chemist and bought even more cicaplast and slather over me. It’s expensive being a sensitive skin girl. 

Then we went to the hospital, and got coffees en route again. I’ve been shouting mum and dad theirs all week, which I think they appreciate. Well dad doesn’t know but I think he would if he knew. 

Dad’s doing okay. He’s in a new room with a care assistant minder because he’s too stubborn to ring the blimmin bell so they put him somewhere where someone will see if he’s struggling. He went off to have a shower and stuff so we changed his sheets and things for him to come back to as we thought that would be nice. He’s in a different room from the old lady I was semi keeping company yesterday, I thought to go see her and say hi but I felt weird and nervous and awkward so I didn’t. Idk if that was a mistake. I had a brief chat with the old man opposite dad though, idk I just feel like if someone is alone in hospital and looks sad and isn’t doing anything eg reading then maybe they’d like someone to smile and say hi how are you, yknow. Some people don’t have families or friends and it makes me sad :( But he had a hacking cough so I kept that convo a bit short. 

Then mum took me to the chemist, then we drove back to theirs. And from then - about 12:30 - til now, 6:45ish, I’ve been in back to back calls with more or less the same people on more or less the same data validation spreadsheets so that’s been a blast. Yay for deadlines. Buuut I met them. Almost. I have a morning meeting tomorrow to discuss some other points because it doesn’t make any sense what they’ve filled? Anyway. 

What else? 

Pups has been adorable, as per. I love him so much. 

I didn’t sleep so well, but not badly either. 

Ummmmmmmmmmmmmm. 

Oh I guess it’s obvious I didn’t go home for the day…? I’d think so. If future me couldn’t pick up on that then perhaps go check in to the latest hospital x 

Ummmmmmmmmmmmm. 

Works been a lot this afternoon. I’ve basically been in a gal 

Hmmm. 

It’s been *beautiful* autumnal weather today. Crisp and sunny, leaves turning and falling all over the show, green lush countryside scenery with layered hills and mountains/ranges and pretty horses and sheep and llamas and cows and various rivers and streams. It’s such a beautiful area around here, but this region is known all over the country as being beautiful and tourists come for the scenery and things so it’s hardly a surprise I’m saying this. 

Things felt better with him last night. More… normal. I didn’t feel like he was fending me off with a 2,000m pole. 

I made dinner for mum and I. Spicy beans in a wrap with cucumber and avocado and toasted corn and coriander and everything. Yum yum. Except as I was finishing I decided I wasn’t even hungry so… oh well mums enjoying it. 

I wonder if it’s easier to go through life having faith, or not? Maybe it’s religious or something else, but believing in something bigger. I don’t. But sometimes I sort of wish I did. But then I wonder maybe that could even make everything harder?

Puppy is so cute. I just got him all rarked up while fluffing up my bedding for bed soon and so I was playing with him and anyway then he got the zoomies and ran past a table and knocked it and mums wine went flying.

A few weeks ago I've accepted an offer for a managerial position at an ASX listed company. I've only worked in consulting and finally decided its time to try an in-house role in industry. I was beyond stoked when I got offered the job, had really good vibes, its an industry that I am passionate about, going to be doing things that align to my are aof interest and strengths (with some areas outside of my expertise but I knew that and am going to give it a good shot).

Today I caught up my soon-to-be manager for a coffee, talked through lots of activities that are taking place presently, incl. how tight budget is (unsurprisingly!), active projects over the next 6 months, my immediate projects for when I start etc. Suddenly I am having second thoughts on whether its the right move.....

Unsure whether its because the catch up had me overwhelmed and because I haven't yet started, I am not able to action any of the things.  or that its the unknown of not having worked in corporate before. I am taking two weeks off before commencing this role so really hoping to use this time to unwind and destress so I can start fresh and excited.

Has anyone experienced the same and if so, how did you manage/sort out this 'feeling'? Any advice or tips will be much appreciated.

Thanks in advanced!",2,1744012769.0,auscorp,3,1.0,False

If you are reading this today and you are looking at the market around you, well it's shit. It is a total bloodbath across the board, but this will change, I have no doubt in my mind that we will enter the biggest bull run ever. Crypto is not for the faint of heart.....  
Regarding the current market situation, this is my take on it:

**Kendu Introduction**

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is just over a year old, we are on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu has an incredible amount of IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!

See the bottom paragraph to read about the **Kendu Standard**

**The Kendu Brand**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
It is crazy that we have all these products at a market cap of 12 million, Kendu is doing all of this whilst most of its holders are down.... Imagine what will happen when Kendu's holders are millionaires, with a lot of money to create!!!

https://preview.redd.it/ee13h47pbdte1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bfd45f80c5410a3ee7a9ad9133b7151a9aa0a73

Kendu Creator is a website that allows people to 3d print a Kendu mask to make videos on social media. These videos can be non crypto related like taekwondo or running or weightlifting, with these videos flooding social media, Kendu is gonna extend its reach even further!!!  
If one of these videos go viral, Kendu will see massive gains

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far. Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.

**Florida Grove**

Kendu will be in Orlando Florida at the Florida Grove Festival to represent Kendu and make a mural. StaySeaArt has donated $1000 to fund this and the community will fund the rest. She is a KENDU LEGEND!!!  
Kendu Energy sponsors the Deliberate Creation Art Gallery, as well as the Live large-scale mural artists during the event, boosting the festival’s creative vibe and social media buzz.This festival will have around 10-15k attendees over 2 days, this will get a lot of eyes on Kendu!!!

**Some Thoughts About Previous Successful Coins**

Shib had a ATH of 44 billion in the bull run in 2021, Pepe had an ATH of 10 billion in a bear market..... In both situations there was far less money in crypto, yet these coins reached face melting ATHs.  
Shib, Doge and Pepe all proved that all you need is a solid community, KOLs don't matter and that the only thing you need is an army of obsessed workers. This is what Kendu has.  
With more money in crypto, far more understanding and belief in memecoins and a proven path, Kendu can top the highs of the previous memecoin hall of famers, Kendu belongs up there with them.  
Kendu is everywhere on social media and we are matching what Pepe, Shib and Doge managed on their run to the top.  
IRL we clear every memecoin ever, all the signs are there

At Kendu, the mission is simple.... we build, build, build until we reach the stars.

**The Kendu Standard**

What is the Kendu Standard?

It is the standard to which Kendu is setting, the standard to which all memecoins will aim to meet after Kendu runs to the billions. Kendu is revolutionising the game with its IRL products and events, the sheer amount of quality and quantity of Kendu's IRL alpha has never been seen or done before..... no coin comes close.  
Kendu is changing the game and we will be the dream for many future coins

Shib, Pepe, Doge or whatever coin that has existed before, has came nowhere near to Kendu's IRL expeditions and soon with enough holders, Kendu will top every coin in social media metrics. This is the Shib opportunity of 2025, but we are not copying Shib, we are transforming the memecoin game.

**Join the winning team, join Kendu**

Check out our tg, you don't need to be a holder and just get a feel for the Kendu vibe. I am sure you will love it : ) We are a very welcoming and hard working community and any questions are always welcome!

This trek provides breathtaking views of Mount Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and many other towering peaks, as well as a deep cultural experience in the Sherpa villages of the Khumbu region. However, it is also known for its demanding nature, with unpredictable weather and extreme altitudes, which requires proper preparation.

One of the primary concerns for trekkers planning this epic adventure is the cost. Understanding the budget breakdown for the Everest Three Pass Trek is crucial for managing your finances while ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience. In this article, we’ll provide an in-depth cost analysis and offer a detailed budget breakdown for the Everest Three Pass Trek, organized by Himalayan Asia Treks.

# Everest Three Pass Trek Cost Overview

The total cost of the Everest Three Pass Trek can vary depending on several factors, such as the duration of the trek, the type of services chosen (luxury or budget), and the inclusions in your trekking package. Typically, the cost for this trek ranges between **USD 2,000 to USD 3,500** for a 16 to 21-day itinerary, which includes all essential services like permits, guide fees, accommodation, food, and transportation.

# 1. Everest Three Pass Trek Cost Breakdown

The cost of the trek is determined by multiple factors, including the following:

# a. Trekking Package Cost

A trekking package typically includes guide and porter fees, accommodation, meals, permits, and transportation. Himalayan Asia Treks offers a variety of packages for trekkers, with standard and premium options depending on the level of comfort and support required.

* **Basic Package**: A budget-friendly option that covers all essentials for the trek. The average cost for this package ranges from **USD 2,000 to USD 2,500**.
* **Luxury Package**: This option includes extra comforts such as more luxurious teahouses, higher quality food, and additional services like a personal assistant or private helicopter for return. The cost for a luxury package typically falls between **USD 2,800 and USD 3,500**.

# b. Permits and Entry Fees

To trek in the Everest region, you will need to obtain the following permits:

* **Sagarmatha National Park Permit**: Required to enter the park and trek in the Everest region. The permit costs around **USD 30 to USD 35** per person.
* **TIMS (Trekkers’ Information Management System) Card**: A necessary permit for trekkers. It costs around **USD 20 to USD 25**.
* **Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality Permit**: This permit is required for entry into the Khumbu region, costing around **USD 20**.

These permits are generally included in your trekking package, but it's important to double-check with your trekking agency.

# c. Guide and Porter Fees

Hiring a guide and porter is highly recommended for the Everest Three Pass Trek. The cost of hiring an experienced guide and porter for the trek generally depends on the trek duration and the level of service provided.

* **Guide Fee**: A licensed and experienced trekking guide costs between **USD 20 to USD 30** per day.
* **Porter Fee**: A porter, who will carry your main luggage (usually up to 15 kg), costs between **USD 15 to USD 20** per day.

For a 16-day trek, the total guide and porter fees can add up to around **USD 500 to USD 700**, depending on the number of days you trek and their experience.

# d. Accommodation

During the Everest Three Pass Trek, trekkers stay in teahouses or lodges, which are available in most of the villages along the trail. The cost of accommodation varies depending on the location and the season. Prices are generally higher at higher altitudes and in more popular trekking areas.

* **Teahouse Accommodation**: The average cost for a basic teahouse room is around **USD 5 to USD 10** per night.
* **Luxury Lodges**: In some of the more popular destinations like Namche Bazaar and Dingboche, you might find higher-end accommodations that charge around **USD 20 to USD 30** per night.

For a 16-day trek, accommodation costs can range from **USD 100 to USD 450**, depending on the type of lodgings you choose.

# e. Meals

Meals are an important part of your trekking experience, and the cost of food along the Everest Three Pass Trek can vary depending on the region, altitude, and your choice of food. The menu typically consists of a variety of Nepali, Tibetan, and Western dishes.

* **Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner**: Expect to pay between **USD 5 to USD 10** per meal in lower altitude villages, and between **USD 8 to USD 15** in higher-altitude locations like Gorak Shep or Dingboche. This cost typically includes a main dish, soup, and tea or coffee.

The total cost for meals over the course of a 16-day trek is estimated to be between **USD 300 to USD 500**, depending on your appetite and the type of food you choose.

# f. Domestic Flights

If you are flying from Kathmandu to Lukla (the starting point of the Everest trek), the round-trip flight usually costs around **USD 350 to USD 450**. Lukla flights are notoriously unpredictable due to weather conditions, so travelers should prepare for delays or cancellations, which may require additional days in Kathmandu or Lukla.

# g. Additional Costs

Other costs that may arise during the trek include:

* **Equipment Rentals**: If you do not have your own trekking gear (such as sleeping bags, jackets, and trekking poles), you can rent these in Kathmandu or in the major trekking towns like Namche Bazaar. Rental costs typically range from **USD 5 to USD 15** per day for each item.
* **Helicopter Return**: Some trekkers choose to return to Kathmandu by helicopter instead of trekking back down. This option costs between **USD 400 to USD 500** per person.
* **Travel Insurance**: It is strongly recommended to purchase travel insurance that covers trekking at high altitudes, as well as evacuation in case of emergencies. Insurance usually costs between **USD 100 to USD 200** for a 2-3 week trek.

# 2. Everest Three Pass Trek Budget Breakdown

Here is a typical budget breakdown for a 16-day Everest Three Pass Trek organized by Himalayan Asia Treks:

|Expense Category|Estimated Cost (USD)|
|:-|:-|
|Trekking Package (Guide, Porter, Lodging)|1,500 - 2,500|
|Permits (Sagarmatha NP, TIMS, Khumbu)|75 - 85|

|Extra Costs (Rentals, Snacks, etc.)|100 - 200|
|**Total Estimated Cost**|**2,500 - 3,500**|

# 3. Tips for Reducing the Cost

While the Everest Three Pass Trek is a relatively expensive trek, there are ways to reduce the overall cost:

* **Travel During Off-Peak Seasons**: Trekking during the off-season (mid-December to February, and June to August) may offer lower prices for accommodations and services. However, weather conditions can be harsher.
* **Opt for Budget Accommodation**: If you're willing to forgo comfort, choosing budget-friendly teahouses and lodges can save you money.
* **Self-Guided Trek**: For experienced trekkers, going without a guide or porter could lower the cost. However, this is not recommended for the Everest Three Pass Trek due to the challenging terrain and high altitudes.
* **Group Trekking**: Joining a group trek can help split the costs of the guide, porter, and other shared services.

# 4. Conclusion

The Everest Three Pass Trek is an extraordinary adventure, and while the costs can add up, it’s worth every penny for the unforgettable experience it offers. With a well-planned budget, you can manage your expenses effectively and enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime trek. Himalayan Asia Treks offers customizable packages to suit different budgets, ensuring that trekkers can embark on this epic journey with peace of mind.

Not a side character in your love story. Not a secret cupid. Just a regular guy trying to survive Chennai weather, late buses, and maybe find someone to go to the beach with on Sundays. That’s all.

But instead, life decided to make me part of their story.

Three cafés. Three different jobs over three months. And somehow these same two people keep showing up. I swear I’m not imagining it.

First café — Starbucks
She was sitting near the window. Calm, chill, typing something. The kind of girl who probably orders mushroom lasagna and listens to old Hindi songs. He walks in. Linen shirt. That serious artsy face. Looks around. Sees her. She sees him. And boom, eye contact. The kind where you think something big is going to happen. But… nothing happens.

I went back to making cold brew. Idhellam enaku en da.

Second café — Besant Nagar side
New place. New vibe. Naan nenaichen this place will be peaceful. But no. Rendu perum again. Different table, same silence, same glances. I wanted to shout, “Guys just talk! Chennai romba periya ooru da. But you keep turning up at the same places like it’s scripted.”

Meanwhile I’m just passing cappuccinos and pretending I’m not the emotional support barista in some low-budget love story.

Third café — Dou, Alwarpet
At this point, I had given up. She walks in, orders lasagna again. He walks in ten minutes later like he’s entering a movie scene. Eye contact again. Naan paathu light-a sirichen. God is definitely doing this on purpose. Maybe He’s bored too.

And now… Reddit-la rendu perum post pannirukaanga.
Avan thinks she’s following him.
Ava thinks he’s following her.
Naan? I’m just out here trying to earn tips and get through my shift without catching feelings.

Honestly… it hurts sometimes. Because I’ve never had someone look at me like that. Even my crush doesn’t see me unless I go and wave straight-up. I’m still single, still working long shifts, still eating 20 rupees’ worth of kadala mix for dinner on bad days.

But these two? They’re out here living in a slow-burn romance directed by some invisible Wes Anderson.

So please. Either talk to each other. Or don’t. But don’t turn every café in Chennai into your personal movie set. Let the rest of us live our simple, unscripted lives. Let me serve coffee in peace without getting emotional at your awkward eye contact.

just for it to.. never become actual hypomania? or at least like consistent there? I feel it for some chunks of the day, but then it goes away?? idk??

1jtfqts,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jtfqts,Artist Residence Oxfordshire,"My wife and I are in England exploring the Cotswolds and London. Oxford is our first stop. 

The Artist Residence resembles an English inn a traveler would encounter in a small village. It's surrounded by historic cottages and old buildings that have existed long before this property came to be. It's a short drive from Oxford the city, but it feels many miles away as there are no sounds except from the nature outside and the frivolity inside. 

There is no real front desk. You walk into the attached pub The Mason Arms where the barman/woman greets you, informs you of your room status, and brings a binder with card reader over to your table to complete verification and accept the deposit. Then you receive your key and are shown to your room, which is either upstairs or outside in a cottage. 

Our room was a loft, and a gorgeous one at that. It was furnished with pieces you might find at an antique store, with 19th century shipping creates as nightstands and large glass jugs rendered into lamps. There's even an old fashioned radio that plays jazz as you enter. It was tall and spacious with the exception of the areas where the roof slopes were.

Many amenities are modern, such as the mini fridge and coffee machine, but they don't take away from the aesthetic. The bathroom includes a large tub and a shower with a waterfall head. Virtually everywhere in the bathroom are Bramley products, of which this establishment is so proud to carry that they encourage liberal use of them for the shower and tub. They also provided a complimentary bottle of Bramley hand soap for us to return home with. (Wonderfully scented products I will add.)

This is the kind of place you stay at if you want to be woken up to the sound of chirping birds. It's a splendid, cozy MMS property that is well worth a stay, particularly if you are renting a vehicle because there are no railways to this little village. Staff was very friendly and loved that we were visiting from abroad. ",2,1744011567.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False
1jtfpn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CandyMafia/comments/1jtfpn2/the_most_popular_candies_in_canada_are_your/,The Most Popular Candies in Canada – Are Your Favorites on the List?,"There’s just something magical about candy. Whether it’s the nostalgic taste of a childhood treat or the thrill of trying a new flavor for the first time, candy brings out the kid in all of us. And here in Canada, we don’t take our sweets lightly!

At [**Candyville**](https://candyville.ca), your go-to [**Canadian candy store**](https://candyville.ca), we’ve seen trends come and go, but some candies continue to reign supreme in the hearts (and stomachs) of Canadians. So we decided to dive into the delicious world of candy and reveal the most popular candies in Canada. Are your favorites on the list?

[The Most Popular Candies in Canada – Are Your Favorites on the List?](https://preview.redd.it/n8ujz6cc9dte1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe0b3ca7e83062ad4c5f9e90fd18f2a59f84008)

**Let’s unwrap the sweet truth.**

**1. Coffee Crisp – Canada’s Classic**

No list would be complete without this iconic Canadian treat. Coffee Crisp has been delighting Canadians since the 1930s with its light, crispy wafer layered with coffee-flavored cream and coated in a thin layer of chocolate. It’s not overpoweringly sweet, and the subtle coffee taste makes it a top pick for grown-ups and nostalgic candy lovers alike.

Fun fact: Coffee Crisp is practically a rite of passage in Canada. If you've never had one, you're missing out on a sweet slice of Canadian culture.

**2. Smarties – Not to Be Confused with the American Ones!**

Let’s get one thing straight – Canadian Smarties are not the same as the chalky, tablet-style candy found in the U.S. Our Smarties are colorful candy-coated chocolate bites, similar to M&M's but with their own unique charm. Canadians love the crispy shell and the smooth chocolate inside – plus, who doesn’t enjoy shaking the box before opening it?

Looking for these delicious little bites in bulk? A [**candy store warehouse**](https://candyville.ca) like Candyville is your best bet!

**3. Skittles – Taste the Rainbow (of Canadian Love)**

Skittles have made a global name for themselves, but Canadians have a particular fondness for these chewy, fruity delights. From the original pack to tropical, sour, and wild berry versions, there's a Skittle flavor for every mood. Their vibrant colors and playful marketing make them a favorite among Gen Z and millennials alike.

Pro tip: Skittles are a must-have for any party candy buffet – grab them at your local candy store Toronto shoppers love for selection and freshness.

**4. Big Turk – A Unique Favorite**

Love it or hate it, Big Turk is a Canadian original that always gets people talking. This chocolate-covered Turkish delight bar is definitely not your average candy, but it has a loyal fan base. It’s slightly chewy, slightly fruity, and coated in a layer of rich milk chocolate – a flavor combo that’s truly one of a kind.

At Candyville, we carry Big Turk and other hard-to-find Canadian classics for those who crave something a little different.

**5. Maynards Swedish Berries – Soft, Juicy, and Irresistible**

Maynards is a Canadian candy powerhouse, and Swedish Berries are one of their most beloved creations. These squishy, berry-shaped gummies burst with juicy flavor and have that perfect chewiness that keeps you coming back for more.

And let’s not forget other Maynards legends like Fuzzy Peaches and Sour Patch Kids – both wildly popular in Canada.

Looking to stock up? Our candy store warehouse has all your gummy dreams in one place!

**6. Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups – Canada’s Chocolate Crush**

Although Reese’s is an American invention, Canadians have fully embraced the peanut butter-chocolate duo. Whether it's the classic cups, mini versions, or even Reese's-stuffed candy bars, this brand is always a top seller.

Perfect for Halloween handouts or mid-day indulgence, Reese’s is a regular feature on Canadian candy shelves – and at Candyville, we always keep them stocked.

**7. Kinder Surprise – The Chocolate Egg with a Toy Inside**

Kinder Surprise holds a special place in the hearts of Canadian kids (and kids-at-heart). This treat combines smooth milk chocolate with a fun toy surprise inside – what’s not to love?

Though banned in some countries, Kinder Surprise eggs are still widely enjoyed in Canada, making them a unique candy experience you can’t always find elsewhere.

Looking for fun treats like this for birthdays or events? Our Canadian candy store has you covered.

**8. Aero – Feel the Bubbles Melt**

This bubbly chocolate bar is another Nestlé gem that's adored across the country. Aero bars are known for their light and airy texture – bite into one and you’ll understand the hype. Available in a variety of flavors like mint, caramel, and dark chocolate, Aero bars are a mainstay in Canadian checkout aisles.

**9. Licorice Allsorts – A Love-It-or-Hate-It Staple**

Licorice Allsorts might not be everyone’s first pick, but they’ve stood the test of time. This assortment of colorful licorice pieces has been a candy bowl staple for generations. If you’re a licorice lover, you know how satisfying it is to find a fresh, chewy pack.

**10. Mars Bar – A Timeless Treat**

Mars Bars, with their caramel, nougat, and chocolate coating, are a universal favorite – and Canada is no exception. Whether frozen for a hot day or eaten straight from the wrapper, they’re a solid choice for candy lovers of all ages.

**Sweet Shopping Starts at Candyville 🍬**

Now that your mouth is probably watering, we’ve got some even better news. You don’t have to scour every corner store to find your favorite Canadian candies – just head to Candyville, your ultimate Canadian candy store experience online.

Whether you're in the mood for nostalgic sweets, international treats, or something new and exciting, Candyville has it all under one roof. From our expansive candy store warehouse to our easy-to-browse online shop, we make it simple (and fun!) to stock up on everything sweet.

Located near or visiting the city? Drop by our candy store Toronto location and see the magic in person!

**Final Thoughts: What’s Your Candy Personality?**

From creamy chocolate bars to sour gummies and chewy classics, Canada’s candy scene is as diverse as its people. Some love the old-school favorites, while others are always on the hunt for the newest flavor drop.

So, which one are you? The nostalgic nibblers? The sweet-and-sour rebels? Or the chocolate connoisseurs?

Then 2 days later, we added each other on Snapchat and ended up talking until 3 AM when both of us had early mornings the next day. About a week ago, we finally decided to hang out and we talked about just meeting up for boba tea and to go to a local fast food establishment. We met up around 3:30 PM and went out for the boba then she said she wanted to go to a mall right down the road so we went and walked around said mall for about an hour and a half. We then went out to the restaurant we picked out and we then headed to a swing dance group at a nearby college campus we are both a part of. After the group, she wanted to go to Applebees so we went along with the rest of our group. We then went and sat in a Taco Bell parking lot and talked for an hour, at one point we also got out of the car as she wanted to dance. At this point, it’s around 1 AM and neither of us are tired so we decide to try to find something open and we found a 24-hour taco shop. We are both full but want desert so we each get a different type of cake and before she even tries hers, she gives me a forkful and in turn, I give her a bite of my cake. After we finish, I suggest we go to a local park and just sit. We the. sit in the parking lot of said park from about 2 AM until 6 AM. We then go watch the sunrise and get coffee together. The. we impulsively decide to go back to her hometown so I can get introduced to her cat and also her family. We then spend that entire day together and do little things around town like going out for food and go shopping at Target. Later that evening, she brings me to a bible study she is a part of and we decide to head out early as there was a snow storm going on. We head back to her house to grab some stuff before we were going to drive me back to my house. Due to the storm, her family lets me stay that night so we both stay safe as roads were pretty bad. She then wants to hang out for a couple more minutes and we decided to play some cards for another hour. At that point, we had been up for 33 hours or so straight just hanging out and talking. We both go to bed, in opposite rooms of course. The next morning, I wake up around 10 AM and she wakes up shortly after and immediately asks if I want her to make me breakfast. I normally don’t eat breakfast but say sure and she made eggs and toast. She had some important stuff to do that evening and needed to get me back to my house but she prolonged my stay at her house and we kept hanging out there until about 1:30 in the afternoon when she finally decided to bring me back home. We then stop for more coffee along the way and talk more. After all was said and done, we had hung out together for basically 48 hours straight. We then continued to talk on Snapchat and are still talking. We met up again two nights ago and did some more swing dancing and went to Applebees again, the. she convinced me to go to a karaoke event that was close by. I then invited her out to pickleball with myself and a few friends from the aforementioned college campus but she declined as she was busy yesterday. I am genuinely confused about all of this as she has stated that “we are better off as friends” and then she also said “please don’t catch feelings for me” but her actions and some other things she has said makes it really seem like she likes me. I am trying to not make it obvious that I have developed a crush on her as she requested the no feelings towards her but I want to know what people think I should do if anything about my dilemma.",1,1744010637.0,mixedsignals,0,1.0,False

We’re Vi and June, two friends in their early 30s, looking to make new friends.

Vi: Cheers! I’m 6’0”, pansexual, sarcastic, ambiguously southeast Asian, and writing and communication are fields I’m proud of. Most of my time is spent in law, technology, or listening to people spill tea. My Google Maps food map is always in need of recommendations and I’m happy to share! I’m trying to neglect my 60 plants less, spend more time with my cat, and make it through the books on my coffee table. I go on walks with June when we’re free, tennis at night with other friends, building community at a mahjong den in Oakland, have a horrible taste in music (please send me your taste), enjoy writing when I can, making postcards, and being the ambivert that listens and enables productive discussion about being human.

June: Hello future friend! I work in healthcare, with a professional fluency in banter. If I’m not binge watching a series, I’m usually traveling. I’m either eating my way through different countries or visiting my loved ones on the East Coast where I used to live. Simple pleasures in life for me: being on the lookout for the best Vietnamese coffee spots, seeing live music at small venues of my favorite indie artists and finding trails/lakes to run around. I’m an extrovert who enjoys meeting all types of people from different walks of life. I am too much of a homebody like my cat Mittens so I am looking forward to building community and hobbies for myself locally.

Her mom asked me questions and to this day I wonder why she asked them. 
We had another girl over, one of her anime club friends. As time went by we wanted to order pizza. The 2 friends ordered regular pizza's like huwain or pepperoni.  At that point I wasn't hungry at all so I decided to order a vegetarian pizza. My one friend went to her dad and gave him the orders, he was generous and asked my friend ""vegetarian, are you sure. We can order any pizza"" he smiled warmly at us and I replied "" yes sir the pizza is what I want"" and he had no problem with it. But I think the mom heard the conversation or they talked about it as we spend the night at the friend. The next morning we were making coffee and I requested just plain coffee because it was too early for sugar or milk for me.
The mom, in the kitchen with us askef ""(my name) are you vegan"" at first I was confused then it hit me, she is referring to the pizza from previous day. I replied ""no, i just like me vegetables "". She nodded and said ""oh there is someone in the family that is vegan. She then looked over at my friend her daughter and asked, ""why the black coffee"" and they advised I don't drink sugar in mornings. She then said ""oh that's why you are so skinny"" At that stage I did not know how to react. 

It was like she was commenting on my body weight and selective eating. The dad was very nice, he asked me if I slept alright and once in a while he would come to me and ask if i was okay since he knew I had a hard time communicating with people, even friends.

“Once someone has played their part in your life, the universe rearranges itself to keep you from crossing paths again.”

It hit me hard because… it’s exactly what happened with my ex.

Back when we were together (and even before), we’d run into each other constantly, same coffee shops, same bus stops, same random corners of the city. It felt like the world was always pulling us into the same scene. Sometimes I’d joke that it was fate.

But after we broke up? Nothing. Not a single accidental glimpse. No awkward encounters. Just total disappearance. And here’s the weird part -  he still lives nearby. We share mutual friends. We move in the same circles. Yet somehow, we’ve become invisible to each other.

And maybe that’s the point.

He played his part. Taught me the hard lessons . Painful ones about boundaries, self-worth, trusting my instincts. Things that shaped me into someone stronger .

Now, I’m in a healthy relationship. One that feels calm. Safe. Right. And I often wonder if I could’ve appreciated this kind of love without first surviving the storm.

Still, it’s strange… how someone can be everywhere one day, and then nowhere without either of you doing a thing.

I’m a first course university student and I think you know what a university national association(UNA) is. It’s a group of students that are united by their nation and basically includes a leadership and volunteers from those who study in that particular university. It does extracurricular activities and makes events on certain cultural celebrations. I am in one of those associations and in an inter-university association of my nation(IUAN) as an official volunteer with a couple of my course mates from my uni. Yesterday we had an event devoted to first aid that was supposed to be organised by our UNA and UNA of another university and held in the office of IUAN. Basically we were invited to this event as guests by my UNA even tho we were the official volunteers of IUAN and were supposed to take part in its organisation in the first place but they kept it secret from us which we were offended by very deeply because we had helped with all the other events that hadn’t been relevant to our profession before and we were not told about the medical event happening considering us being medical students. I as a first course student worked my ass off to help on all the other events and tried my best to treat everyone with kindness and be friendly because I liked being around my fellow countrymen, it felt very warm to be around those who understood u the best. And yesterday because I was offended I wasn’t as nice as always but I wasn’t rude either. 
The event’s program was in this sequence: you register and get a bracelet to participate in doing different cases of first aid and if you don’t you’re just a viewer which is okay. After registration we listen to a lecture of our professor who came from my uni particularly for this event and then do the first aid itself. Everyone had a different bracelet color so that equal amount of people were on different first aid stations. 
So what’s the tea. There is this one 5th course student(let’s call her Amy) who is in the leadership of my UNA and we were in completely good terms, she saw how hard I tried to always be helpful to them and I thought she’s a nice person even tho I’d been told before that I should be careful with her and she may be toxic. Out of 1 mil requests that she had for me I said no to 2 of them that day:
1. She asked me to kick out the guests that were having a break after lecture in the kitchen so that the lecturer herself could have a break by drinking coffee. I said there was no need because they are the guests OF YOUR event, it’s completely disrespectful to kick em out and the teacher is not that special in comparison to them and she could have her coffee that way. That annoyed Amy for some reason.
2. We(my 3d course student friend and I) ripped off our bracelets at first because we wanted to keep the honor of our 5th course student friend who was already quite advanced in the topic of first aid and wanted to take part in the organisation of this event but was ignored so she didn’t come on purpose. Amy saw that and was confused at first but then said to wear another two bracelets at least for show. Which we did. 
And later we decided to participate after all to support our university because we were the presenters of it and put the honor aside. But we did all the first aid things chaotically on whatever station we saw was quite free. 
The culmination was me asking her why she hadn’t her white coat on when all the other coordinators did(the dearest leadership, that thought the cool professional event is only theirs to shine, all wore the coat except for her) and this was asked in a friendly tone by the way. I was expecting for an answer like: “it’s hot in here” or “I don’t feel comfortable wearing it in my outfit”. What she said was “watch your language when you talk to me, especially in front of people”. She’s not my friend, my teacher or sister for me to respect her on the level she wants me to and I never said anything offensive to her. So wtf was that response I don’t know. I texted her later about it, asking what was that aggression about and she hasn’t responded yet.

“Once someone has played their part in your life, the universe rearranges itself to keep you from crossing paths again.”

It hit me hard because… it’s exactly what happened with my ex.

Back when we were together (and even before), we’d run into each other constantly, same coffee shops, same bus stops, same random corners of the city. It felt like the world was always pulling us into the same scene. Sometimes I’d joke that it was fate.

But after we broke up? Nothing. Not a single accidental glimpse. No awkward encounters. Just total disappearance. And here’s the weird part -  he still lives nearby. We share mutual friends. We move in the same circles. Yet somehow, we’ve become invisible to each other.

And maybe that’s the point.

He played his part. Taught me the hard lessons . Painful ones about boundaries, self-worth, trusting my instincts. Things that shaped me into someone stronger .

Now, I’m in a healthy relationship. One that feels calm. Safe. Right. And I often wonder if I could’ve appreciated this kind of love without first surviving the storm.

Still, it’s strange… how someone can be everywhere one day, and then nowhere without either of you doing a thing.

Anyone else experienced this? Or believe in this invisible pattern shift of being everywhere to nowhere ? Because now that I’ve noticed it, I can’t unsee it.",2,1744008770.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Not pointing fingers… okay, maybe just a little, I keep seeing people around me do the *same financially questionable stuff*, month after month — and then wonder why they’re broke by the 20th.

Here’s a quick list of daily money drains that middle-class folks keep falling for:

**Gold Bought at Peak Prices:** Never sold. Just lying in lockers like emotional security blankets.

**Tuition for Every Kid, Needed or Not:** “Sharma ji ka beta bhi jaata hai” is now official logic.

**Insurance Policies Investments:** ""Double ho jaayega"" = heartbreak and low returns.

**Branded Phones & Gadgets on EMI:** Using a ₹1.5L phone to scroll memes and take bathroom selfies… but worried about chutney charges.

**Gym Memberships Never Used:** Join in January. Quit by Republic Day. “Will go from next Monday.”

**Overpriced International School Fees:** ₹1.5 lakh/term to learn ABCD and force parents to send chart paper every week.

**Baba Ji Ka Solution for Everything:** ₹25,000 for “negative energy removal.” Still stuck in traffic and loans.

**Paying for 4 OTT Subscriptions:** When Jio Cinema and Hotstar are free. But okay, Netflix premium life. OTT + YouTube Premium + Reels All Day, Still can’t finish a single documentary.

**Fancy Restaurant Weekends:** ₹2K date lunch or night. Then living off poha and maggi till salary day.

**Car Just for Show:** ₹15K EMI per month, but fuel tank always on empty.

**Zomato/Swiggy Addiction:** Kitchen full of groceries. Still, “bhaiya ek biryani bhej do.” Delivery Charges + Tips + Fees: ₹90 food, ₹160 bill. Because ₹20 “for rider bhaiya.”

**₹300 Coffee for “Mood”:** When ₹30 nescafé and ice cubes could’ve fixed it.

**Online Shopping “Because Sale Tha”:** Didn’t need it. Still bought it. Regret is on the house.

**Random GPay Rounding Off:** “Keep the change” – the sneakiest wallet leak of them all.

**AC Full Blast Even in March:** Then act shocked when the bill hits ₹3,000+.

**Cabs for Walkable Distances:** ₹50 to avoid walking 500m. Health = zero.

**Recharge Plans Full of Junk Add-ons:** Caller tunes, “extra night data,” hello tunes, no one asked for these.

**Bottled Detox Juices:** ₹80 for “health.” Nimbu pani outside = ₹10 + better taste.

**Expensive Soaps/Shampoos:** ₹500 Dove or L'Oréal. Still same dandruff.

**Cloud Storage Subscriptions:** Paying every month instead of deleting old memes and cringe screenshots.

So there’s this coffee drive thru close to the place i work and i have been going there like 5 days a week since 8 months.

For the past 3-4 months there’s this cute girl on the pickup window. I thought sure might be older and never really made a move on her although we do smile at each other and make genuine eye contact mostly always.

3 days ago when I was at the window there was her coworker who was handing me my coffee and she was behind her doing her work. When she saw me she immediately tapped her coworker and asked her to hold on and she came to the window and asked me the most random thing. She asked where I got my car from ? I mean she’s been seeing the same car for like 2-3 months now. To which I replied and did not continue the conversation although she seemed to be interested cuz I was getting late for work. 

Now I feel this could have been my chance. 

What do you guys think about this ? Should I just talk to her next time? I don’t even know her name tbh.

Advice please

Have identified as ace since college, would read as aro to most. Soft spoken, introverted, oddball sense of humor, maybe a little cynical sometimes but am cheerful and well adjusted about it, comfortable in my own skin. 20+ year greater LA resident, currently live in a little house a few miles from the ocean with my cat. Generally into (& looking for) guys to date.

I’m often out and about doing active/outdoorsy things on weekend – lately, skiing, hiking, and running. Otherwise, I’m happiest at home reading a book, cooking, baking, gardening, playing with my cat, catching up with friends or just sitting in the sun in the yard. I see live music fairly often (classical concerts mostly), enjoy the random restaurants my friends bring me to, get out to live theater or a museum on occasion, and end up doing Disney/Knott’s once a year or so. I work in tech as an engineer and enjoy it, though am fairly clueless about a lot of personal technology (I am the last person you want fixing your wifi).

Some potential dealbreakers if they matter to you: on the spectrum, drink alcohol semi-regularly (good beer, cocktails), use 420 on rare occasions (edibles), not a big traveler and not looking to change that (ski and hike trips are about as much as I want), tend to be out of the loop on TV, movies, gaming and most fandoms, am a bad texter to people who care a lot about that, workaholic on occasion.

I’m looking to meet guys for dating who would be open to a QPR or something like it. You’re hopefully in my age range (30s-40s), fairly independent, have some amount of quirky oddball energy, may be neurodivergent like me (I find it easier to relate to people who are), and are in a similarly good early midlife groove in terms of career/adulting. Bonus points for some common interests. I much prefer getting to know people in person vs. over text and would prefer someone local enough to meet up with if there’s mutual interest (coffee? microbrewery? theme park? hike? ski a few runs if we’re in mammoth on the same weekend?), though am open to video chatting too.

We wouldn’t be a good match if you prefer frequent back & forth texts/chats to communicate (you would find me a frustrating correspondent), live far enough away that meeting up in person is not possible, tend toward an anxious attachment style (no judgement, but this hasn’t worked well for either side in the past), dislike cats, support the current president, or are anti-science/anti-environment.",1,1744008551.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

First time was at Starbucks—he sat across from her, all casual-like. She clocked him. He clocked her. I clocked both of them and went back to my cappuccino. Cool.

Second time, different café, opposite side of the city. There they are again. Still pretending not to know each other. Still radiating that “maybe the universe is doing something” energy. Nobody asked the universe, though.

Third time? Dou, Alwarpet. She’s mid-lasagna. He walks in like it’s fate, not GPS. Eye contact happens. Again. At this point, I’m convinced they think they’re in a limited series directed by Wes Anderson. I, unfortunately, am the unwilling extra sipping an overpriced flat white in the background.

(F28, M33)","I (F28) recently worked at a small store where I handled the front-of-house while he (M33) worked in the back. When he joined the team, we quickly hit it off—there was an instant vibe. He’d always find little excuses to talk to me, linger around, and subtly check if I was single. The chemistry felt mutual, and he was charming without being over the top.

At one point, I asked if we could add each other on social media, and he did. We didn’t really chat there until I had a breakdown at work (it was a very toxic environment and that day just pushed me over the edge). That same day, I quit my job on the spot.

Later that evening, he messaged me to check if I was okay. We started talking more after that—he checked in on how I was feeling, was genuinely kind and supportive. About a week in, he mentioned meeting up that weekend. I agreed, but we didn’t confirm anything concrete. Later he said he wasn’t feeling mentally well, which I completely understood and didn’t make a big deal about.

Then a few days later, he asked if I was free after work to meet up—and I was. So we met.

And honestly, it was such a fun date. We had food, played pool, walked by the dock and talked for hours. We didn’t kiss or anything—it was respectful and lighthearted, but I definitely felt a connection. I went home feeling happy. I texted him thanking him for the night, and he replied saying it was nice seeing me outside of work. He even suggested we meet again that weekend for a movie. He offered to come all the way to me (we live about 2 hours apart, both using public transport), but I suggested meeting halfway, and he agreed, saying he’d find something and let me know.

Everything seemed fine… until it wasn’t.

I texted him Friday and got no reply. Saturday morning, he responded saying he wasn’t feeling well physically and asked how my weekend was going. I replied and asked if he was feeling better and got some rest. No reply after that. I didn’t overthink it too much—until the next day, when I discovered he had blocked me on all social media. Just like that.

I was honestly in shock. Everything had felt so normal and natural. He hadn’t hinted at anything being wrong. Our conversations were warm, respectful, and mutual. I wasn’t expecting a relationship after one date, but I did think we had enough mutual respect and maturity to at least talk if he wasn’t feeling it. We were also coworkers and good friends—I thought we’d at least stay in touch, even just casually. I would’ve been fine grabbing coffee every once in a while, keeping it platonic if that’s what he wanted.

But being blocked like that, without any explanation, just hurt. I still don’t understand what happened. Part of me wonders if there was someone else in the picture, or if he just wanted something casual and changed his mind. I’ll probably never know.

I do still have his number—he hasn’t blocked me there—but I’m not going to text or call him. I have pride. If someone chooses to block me out of nowhere after being so warm and attentive, then maybe he was never really the person he showed me to begin with.

Still, I can’t lie—it’s been bugging me all day. I miss the connection we had. I miss the possibility of something good. And I wish I could understand why.

1jtesu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1jtesu4/dream_about_death/,Dream About Death,"TL;DR: Had a dream where I died and saw what the afterlife is really like. It has stuck with me for years.

I had this dream in my first year of college, during the spring of 2019. My sleep schedule was horrendously fucked up, but I didn't have any bad dreams before this. In fact typically have dreamless sleep and when I had this one it was really surprising.

The dream started with me being dead. I don't know how I died, I just knew the second I started dreaming that ""huh I'm dead. That sucks"".

I couldn't see anything and when I say anything I mean ANYTHING. It wasn't a black void, but actual oblivion. The complete absense of everything. Sorry if that is a bit vague, but I don't know how to describe what I saw other than that. I existed in the emptyness for a bit, trying to make sense of what was happening. Then I realized that I was standing in an apartment.

Now keep in mind, I am still in oblivion, but somehow it had started to take form. I just instictively knew that here was a kitchen, living room, a door behind me that I had gotten there from (I never actually walked through that door) and a door on the other side of the room that led to the bedroom. I walked over to the couch in the living room and sat down, trying to understand what was happening. When I sat down, I saw there was a window in front of me that showed a clear night sky. 

I look out that window for an hour or so, puzzled by the visual of a patch of clear night sky in a see of oblivion, before I heard a voice to my left. I looked in the direction of the voice and saw a man sitting there wearing black jeans, a grey hoodie, and a black and white mask.

This mask has burned itself in my brain, so I am going to take a second to describe it in more detail. The mask is aesthetically split vertically down the middle. There are no holes on this mask for the eyes or breathing. One half is black with a mark where the eye would be that is white. The other half is the opposite, white with a black eye mark. This mask wraps around the entire head, so no peaks behind it.

The man was speaking in a language that I have never heard before, but I still understood what he was saying. He spent some time calming me down, but once I was calm he began talking about the afterlife. We spoke for hours and I don't remember everything he said, but the gist of it is that conscience beings are able to warp reality into what they believe it is suppose to be when they die and enter the afterlife. This is caused by conscience minds being severed from all connection to the universe, effectively transporting them to a state of oblivion. However, conscience minds are capable of effecting the reality they are in (to a very minor degree). Normally this effect is overwhelmed by the universe, but in a state of oblivion they are the only thing shaping the reality around them.

It was around this time I noticed that me and this man were not alone in this room. Behind the couch in the corner of the room closer to the man I am speaking to than me, there was some form of entity. It had the same mask as the man I was speaking to, but other than that it was formless. But it was big. A black void (an actual void not the oblivion everything else in the room looked like) that was at least 7 feet tall that was creeping out of the corner, but not moving at the same time. It hurt to look at and I snapped my vision back to the man on the couch. He told me to not look at it and that it wasn't a threat. I asked him what it was and I didn't quite understand what he said when he responded. However, I think it was something along the lines of it being a force of nature that had yet to be fully understood by humanity.

When he was done describing what the thing was, some how it dawned on me that this man was me. He was a version of me that full understood the mysteries of the universe and was closely associtated with that thing that was in the corner of the room.

At this point I was freaking out a little bit, but the man on the couch was still calm. He directed me to the window and asked me to take a look outside. I did what he said, stumbling around the coffee table that was apparenty there and got a better look outside of the window. I saw an endless city of clear boxes.

It was beautiful. A city of lights only outmatched by the starry night above. On closer look, I realized that each box as a little pocket dimension. Heaven was the first one I recognized, but there were thousands of them. Each one seemed centered on one person. The man explained that most people do not learn the information he had just told me before they died, so their minds subconsciencely warp their local reality to be when they believed their afterlife should be. Every person's afterlife was there. Some people shared afterlifes since they shared the same thing after they died.

I sat back on the couch and asked the man ""so if I know all of this now, then what will happen to me?""

""You will end up back here."" He said, ""this is your afterlife. You have the freedom to go anywhere you want from here. Build the afterlife you want, or explore all that this realm has to offer.""

I was excited. This place was incredible and the idea that I had the complete freedom to do whatever I wanted made me wish I could stay. Be he could tell what I was thinking. ""Unfortunately, it isn't your time yet."" He then pushed me back and I woke up.

When I woke up, I gasped for air. My lungs were burning like I wasn't breathing for a while and my entire body was sore. It felt like I really died and that man brought me back to the land of the living.

This last part isn't really a part of the dream so ignore this if you wish. But for just a moment when I woke up, I could see the entity that was in the corner of that apartment in oblivion in the corner of my room in real life.

Needless to say, freaked me the fuck out. What do y'all think? Is there any meaning behind this? If there are any extra details or info you want to know feel free to ask and I will respond when I can.

1jterb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1jterb3/this_student_cold_emailed_elon_musk_and_it_worked/,This student cold emailed Elon Musk and it worked.,"Nikolas Bonatos wanted to interview Elon Musk. Instead of messaging someone at Tesla, he cold emailed Elon directly — and got a response.

Here’s why I think it worked:

**1/ Building Rapport Like a Human**

Niko started by establishing familiarity.

When someone opens a cold email, the first thing they subconsciously assess is: ""Is this a spammy pitch or an internet creep?""

You have to get past the crocodile brains first. And the key is emotion.

When you remind someone of their time at university, or graduating, there’s an ingrained emotion of nostalgia. If the readers doesn’t feel something in the first second, they stop reading.

**2/ Sincere Appreciation > Flattery**

Elon knows he’s built one of the most innovative companies in the world.

But, it feels good to be reminded with genuine admiration — not over-the-top praise, but a heartfelt and personal note.

Make them feel special and yourself qualified

As Dale Carnegie says ""Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise""

**3/ Have a SIMPLE ask**

The worst thing you can ask for is a ""coffee"" or a ""quick 20 min call"" (or worst of all - ""to pick their brain"" That’s not an ask. That’s a vague request for their time.

Instead, Niko made a specific, actionable request: to interview Elon for his research paper on Tesla's Corporate Strategy.

\> It showed he had a plan.

\> It respected Elon’s time.

\> And it signaled that he was a person of action.

Niko is a master at cold emailing, he's gotten responses from Evan Spiegel -Founder of Snapchat (asking for an internship) and Steve Ballmer - Former CEO of Microsoft.

1jtepy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jtepy7/how_do_you_go_from_being_so_kind_to_blocking/,How do you go from being so kind to blocking someone overnight?,"I (F28) recently worked at a small store where I handled the front-of-house while he (M33) worked in the back. When he joined the team, we quickly hit it off—there was an instant vibe. He’d always find little excuses to talk to me, linger around, and subtly check if I was single. The chemistry felt mutual, and he was charming without being over the top.

At one point, I asked if we could add each other on social media, and he did. We didn’t really chat there until I had a breakdown at work (it was a very toxic environment and that day just pushed me over the edge). That same day, I quit my job on the spot.

Later that evening, he messaged me to check if I was okay. We started talking more after that—he checked in on how I was feeling, was genuinely kind and supportive. About a week in, he mentioned meeting up that weekend. I agreed, but we didn’t confirm anything concrete. Later he said he wasn’t feeling mentally well, which I completely understood and didn’t make a big deal about.

Then a few days later, he asked if I was free after work to meet up—and I was. So we met.

And honestly, it was such a fun date. We had food, played pool, walked by the dock and talked for hours. The conversation were meaningful, he asked about my life, told me some of his deep personal stories. We didn’t kiss or anything—it was respectful and lighthearted, but I definitely felt a connection. I went home feeling happy. I texted him thanking him for the night, and he replied saying it was nice seeing me outside of work. He even suggested we meet again that weekend for a movie. He offered to come all the way to me (we live about 2 hours apart, both using public transport), but I suggested meeting halfway, and he agreed, saying he’d find something and let me know.

Everything seemed fine… until it wasn’t.

I texted him Friday and got no reply. Saturday morning, he responded saying he wasn’t feeling well physically and asked how my weekend was going. I replied and asked if he was feeling better and got some rest. No reply after that. I didn’t overthink it too much—until the next day, when I discovered he had blocked me on all social media. Just like that.

I was honestly in shock. Everything had felt so normal and natural. He hadn’t hinted at anything being wrong. Our conversations were warm, respectful, and mutual. I wasn’t expecting a relationship after one date, but I did think we had enough mutual respect and maturity to at least talk if he wasn’t feeling it. We were also coworkers and good friends—I thought we’d at least stay in touch, even just casually. I would’ve been fine grabbing coffee every once in a while, keeping it platonic if that’s what he wanted.

But being blocked like that, without any explanation, just hurt. I still don’t understand what happened. Part of me wonders if there was someone else in the picture, or if he just wanted something casual and changed his mind. I’ll probably never know.

I do still have his number—he hasn’t blocked me there—but I’m not going to text or call him. I have pride. If someone chooses to block me out of nowhere after being so warm and attentive, then maybe he was never really the person he showed me to begin with.

Still, I can’t lie—it’s been bugging me all day. I miss the connection we had. I miss the possibility of something good. And I wish I could understand why.",6,1744007106.0,dating_advice,14,0.8,False

1jteode,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cloisville/comments/1jteode/pariah_clark_its_gonna_be_ok/,"Pariah: Clark, it's gonna be ok.","In Scare, Jonathan says he's not sure that it's Lana, but he is sure that someday there will be someone Clark can tell about his secret. This is really the only allusion I could find of Lois in this episode. Bound didn't have any.

In Unsafe, we open with what I think plays a huge part into Clark's actions in both the Arc of Suck and Infamous. He gets hit on by a couple of girls and Martha wonders if he's going to ask either of them out, to which Clark replies that he would ruin it when they're getting close by having to lie about who he really is, just like he did with Lana. Martha replies that there is someone out there for Clark, and he says a girl would have to be crazy to get into a relationship with him. Now obviously this is very tongue in cheek to set up Alicia coming back, but there is a deeper message. Clark doesn't think he can get close with someone without not being able to share who he really is. He sees his heritage as an obstacle and a burden for anyone who would date him.

The way that Tom Welling can go from having such a boyish cute smile on his ice-skating date with Alicia, to his devilishly sexy smirk as red K Clark should be studied, it is so impressive. And that hip roll is too hot for prime time TV and I don't know how it made it onto the screen lol. I also think it's interesting that this red K Clark wants to get married, not just so he can ""seal the deal"" as it were, but because he is desperate to not be alone and thinks that because Alicia is different, she's his best option.

Martha describing what marriage is about is what Clark will eventually have with Lois. And when Clark says Alicia makes him feel both normal and special, I think that there is a caveat of her knowing his secret already. Because I don't think anyone before knowing his secret make him feel normal..... except for Lois.

We start Pariah with Clark making an ill-advised appearance with Alicia at the Talon for a karaoke night, with Chloe, Lana and Jason. Lois puts her foot in her mouth by accidentally whispering into the mic Clark's situation with Alicia and how first they were married and now they're dating. I would have loved to have seen Lois get told this information, her face would have been priceless. Clark does give her a withering look, which I find hilarious. I also think it's funny that at the hospital, Lois and Chloe are basically wearing the same thing, jeans and a blazer with a pin. For someone who doesn't know Alicia, Lois is sure quick to judge and call out Clark thinking with his little brain. It's one of the few episodes where I would say Lois is a bit jealous and Clark is not. I think he sees that Lois was pretty much forced into having a coffee date with Tim, and he is not threatened. Tim is also the one time we see Lois date a high school student. The rest of her love interests are more mature and men, not boys.

I definitely think Martha suggesting she and Clark stay with Lana is because she wants to get Clark away from Alicia so she's encouraging him to hang out with Lana.

Alicia showing Chloe Clark's secret is so layered. On the one hand, it's such a huge betrayal that if she had stayed alive, Clark would have never forgiven her. But on the other hand, it's the best case scenario with how Chloe reacts, and furthers the plot for Clark, because someone in his inner circle knows again. Clark hasn't really been able to turn to anyone besides his parents after Pete left, which could also explain why he felt so strongly about Alicia. So it was ultimately a good thing that Alicia did, even though her motives were selfish.

Lois is on her date with Tim, and it's not going well. He starts spouting off about the good ole days of Smallville and Lois basically gets the ick lol, and dips out, wanting to find Clark to let him know she thinks Alicia isn't behind the attacks.

Say what you will about Alicia, but her death is a very sad moment in Clark's life. And I wonder if Tom didn't use the knowledge of this having happened before, a dead paramour in Clark's arms, to help with the scene because it is a visceral pain that Clark is drowning in. Lois finds him and tells him she thinks she knows who did this and where to find them.

Clark gets there before Lois and proceeds to fight with Tim, who is taunting him about what he did. We get a very angry Clark about to choke the life out of Tim, and he says he loved Alicia, which I agree with and I get annoyed when later in Mortal, Clark refutes this and says that Lana in the only one he's every really loved. Ugh but I digress...Lois shows up to stop Clark, but it takes a bit for her to get through his anguish and stop him from making a huge mistake. But then again, she's Lois and can reach Clark on a level no one else really can, and before either of them have even admitted that they are in fact friends, she is able to bring him back to himself and he doesn't kill Tim. Normally I believe Lois would hug Clark after something as intense as that, but I don't think they were even allowed to hug yet. But Lois tries to reassure Clark that everything is going to be ok.

Lois gives Chloe the best advice when it comes to pushing or not pushing her knowledge of Clark's secret. She shows that glimpse of depth underneath the bluster, that she's learned the hard way that people keep secrets for a reason and if she knew something about somebody they didn't want her to know, she would wait for them to come to her but be as supportive as she can in the meantime. It's a very mature response from Lois and something she remembers when she learns Clark's secret years later.

I like that Chloe took Lois' advice and tried to just be there for Clark when she found him at Alicia's grave, and I know it meant a lot to Clark, but I do think it's interesting that though she said she was there if he wanted to talk, Clark still chose not to open up to her or show an outward sign of his grief. He was very stoic and closed off.

Lois calls Clark Smallville - 2

Clark smiles this episode - 5(I don't think he actually smiles this episode)

It's a windy and cold day today. Not perfect weather for good things to happen.  
But I do have some lucky story to share.

Let's start with something not that important.  
I woke up late as usual. Struggled to get out of my cozy bed, as usual.  
Heated up the water but had no time to make myself even a cup of hot drink for breakfast, as usual.

And what's unusual?  
The bus stopped. Right in my way when I was hurrying to my psychologist.  
I had to make a phone call to explain that I might be 30 minutes late — which was just late enough for the receptionist to suggest rescheduling.  
But thanks to my lovely psychologist, we still made it and we met.

What else is unusual?  
It’s my first time going to my psychologist and saying: ""I think everything is all good.""  
Because I'm either in depression or anxiety most of the time.

Does that mean I'm unlucky or unhappy?  
No. Definitely not.

And here comes my important part —  
I received an offer!!

If you're a computer science student struggling to find your first industry-related job, you’ll understand what that means.  
How desperate it was, and how exciting it would be.

I always believe I’m blessed and lucky.  
Not blessed by God or any higher existence — but by myself.  
I’ve been blessed by the past me, who worked so hard and put 200% effort into a 1% opportunity.  
I’m blessed by the future me — the one who won’t give up no matter how hard or scary the situation is.  
I’m lucky because I always find a way out for myself.

After I explain how I got the job, you’ll know I wasn’t just shooting the bull.

I decided to find an industry-related job one month ago.  
I got my resume ready a week later and decided to send at least 10 resumes every day.  
After a week, I found I didn’t get any replies inviting me to interviews.  
So I booked a session with a career advisor at uni, where another group of students also couldn’t find industry-related jobs but happened to find a job at uni.

But I did get some useful advice — they helped me see how competitive the career market is.  
And I guess I transferred my anxiety to them as well, because after they found out how hard I tried, they realized they should work harder too.  
Some of them even booked an advisor afterward.

I had coffee chats with a few alumni in the tech industry and heard some fresh news about the job market —  
Like how some companies are giving international position quotas to countries like India.  
After that, most people might feel hopeless. That’s how most of my peers felt. Same as me.  
But I also realized I needed to change my strategy.

I changed my question from ""How can I get my first job?"" to  
""What should I do now to help me find a job a few months later?""

I started to look for some IT volunteer jobs and worked on my personal projects.  
Then I got an interview from a tech company about a volunteer position.  
I attended the interview, I thought I f\*cked it up — but they offered me the Sponsorship Officer position. And here I am!

I told my psychologist how much I regret getting all those sales experiences —  
because I don’t want to be a salesperson now.  
But it definitely helped me get this job, especially when I lacked the hardcore skills to join the tech team.  
My so-called “waste of time” experience helped me get the position closest to where I want to be.

There’s no wrong path.  
There’s always a path for everyone.

Thanks for reading — I’m just a happy little island today

1jten6b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1jten6b/thoughts_on_flipping_from_my_27_years_doing_this/,Thoughts on flipping from my 27 years doing this,"Hey r/flipping, chin up. 

I see alot of you folks expressing worry and stress that the bottoms going to fall out. 

I started in this industry selling random shit, dumpster diving for free shit, then I graduated to goodwill and Salval, then garage sales, flea markets, auctions, unclaimed freight auctions, buyouts, closeouts, white label, private label, private sales, middle man collections sales, to now collections brokering which seems to be where I am having the most fun. 

I love flipping, it allowed me to buy my houses, the businesses i own, it led me to meet my incredible wife, and it's the sole driver of my personal and professional network. 

  
Here's what i'm doing, and here's what i would do if I were you no matter how much money you have. 

I'm a collections broker-- I broker the sale of HNW (high net worth) individuals material objects-- most times it's for a divorcing couple who have collected over the years and have decided the only way they can separate their stuff is to sell and divide the check. Other times i sell for folks that have hit hard times- that live like the Jones's until the chicken comes home to roost and they are forced to quietly sell their items. I also help them replace their collections with lower ticket price items if they need to presente bene. 

In this market, if you're rich and you fucked up, you're likely 2nd or 3rd gen rich, so I end up selling alot of family heirlooms. This past 6 months, that market changed abruptly, I started getting calls from smart money--people that bought antiquities or art knowing it would appreciate (i.e. alternative asset class money)--they wanted to hedge their exposure or sell the underperformers as they put in place tax avoidance strategies as they prepared to sell securities holdings that had been shooting to the moon since 2010 in prep to pay out the nose in capital gains. This was not entirely my wheelhouse--so once again I had to get acquainted with a new group of folks. 

My Winter has been slammed with HNW families moving their US holdings out of the US. In some cases that has meant selling, but mainly it's storing while they weight their options. Lots of Canadian families looking to sell the FL collection, and re-stage for HNW rental. Lots of fancy cars being sent to private hangers or quietly marketed to see if anyone wants to pay or trade. 

The line I keep hearing from my clients is ""it's going to be great for opportunistic buyers this next few years""

As I watched the markets this past week, I saw they were right---te oppurtunistic buyers-- TJMAxx, Burlington, Ross, Marshalls. The flipping cohort of the Fortune 500 watched big retail take a shit with an exuberance only a liquidator could feel. 

I'm taking a week to really understand the signal and the noise. Get a feel for the actual pain retailers and wholesalers are feeling. I know that the autoparts guys are shitting their pants, but i'm going around to my regional retailers and literally asking them what their doing. Ask people shit, ask your goodwill people if their getting more or less stock from distro, take Joanns for example- closing of course, but if you go to any craft fair, you see shitloads of people selling essentially crap they bought at Joanns and added some crafty flair too, sure they have Amazon, but without de minimus, and with pressure on the Shenzhen sellers, alot of those craft material prices become untenable. I asked some craft fair people today of the prices doubled where would they look for stock-- ""I would mill my own"" ""I would look on facebook"", ""Michaels"", ""I think my abs filament is US-made""--talk to people, not just flippers. Go on subs here on reddit and see what the people in the muck are dealing with-- r/autozone is great for this, so are any of the hourly worker subs. 

I'm putting myself in my buyers shoes-- and I hope you all will do the same. I know as a flipper, especially the ""I want to make an extra 5-20K "" brand, it's more about seeing what sells, and not really giving a fuck what it is, just checking sold listings and hoping the buyer doesn't ask for a refund. I get this, but it's not scalable. I do in a day what i did year 14 total. The way i scaled was i got started exploring the why of selling. For example--Why does Ashley Longshore sell? Is it just that Blake Lively gave her a co-sign? It is because she's a NoLA artist who has fought her way from the bottom?  it is becasue she's going to be worth more? is it a good investment? Is it a signal of class? NOPE! Turns out the why is that it's rich-people cheap. it's a painting that only will run you $25K, and they can call it Fun! or Fierce! or Silly and buy one or a couple for their walk in closet, or their dressing room or their dogs fart room. Who knew 35K art can be bought every Friday.

The point is that I'm taking what ive been selling and i'm examining both why i've been selling and being careful to figure out if anything is changing. If you sell collectiables, start checking google trends for that keyword-- add ""how much is my xxxx worth?"" see if the market is about to get flooded. 

To the liquidators-- buying for 6 cents on the dollar and selling for 30 is a goldmine. Go to unclaimed freight auctions, call up drayage docks and offer to buy dead stock. Get a cohort of truck drivers that will call you with rejected loads and be ready to sell your ass off. I once got a 12 pallet from a trucker with a rejected Aldis load for $.03/dollar, and sold 2 dollar dozens of roses, then I dried the fuckers and sold those too!-- get to know the drayage and truckers, seriously, it's worth it. 

To the FBAers-- capitalize on the removal of the de mimimus exemption--- find a crazy volume selling widget, find a US supplier NOW, if their isn't one, convince a US manufacturer to make one, beg a 3d printer farm to make it, whatever you have to do, wait for the Chinese or Vietnamese version to sell out, then take their listing and their buy box. Or make a new listing. 

To the dropshippers-- eat shit, you're a trend line 

To the dumpster divers-- prepare for boxes of unsold avocados, insane amounts of perfectly good returns now that it's fully not worth the money of restock or reship-- start stocking shipping supplies you find to sell to other flippers on facebook like bubble wrap--- other flippers will be trying to cut costs, you should provide the place to do that. Start diving metal-- just as an example-- for every 1 job Trump has tariffed in the steel creation industry (of which the US accounts for 4% of demand), we have 80 jobs that use steel as an intermediate manufacturing item for their own end product---he tarrifed 1 guy that provides the product for 80, you think that won't move the dial? it's a shitshow. 

To the eBayers-- Americans will always buy bullshit, but if you absolutely must sell collectibles, sell the shit that people with no responsibilities buy, not the people that have a mortgage. So young folks and rich folks. My favorite game is buying on eBay and reselling through the larger auction houses. I know a dozen multi-millionaries that would rather buy for 30% over estimate at Barrett-Jackson than 40% under on eBay. Time to find your niche and run with it. 

If you sell non-collectible eBay-- I would start buying broken foreign made shit and breaking it down for parts-- (non electric!--avoid those refunds) I know a guy that sells Kitchaid parts, and Keurig parts that has a mid 6 figure take home.

To the shadies-- just ask the fellas over at r/reptime/ the fake industry is getting absolutely smacked with import audits and inspections-- no more superclone rolex or Pateks for a while. Most of my clients wear superclones, gotta get them somewhere. 

To the Retail Arb ppl-- figure out a small item that sells well that is about to spike. Nespresso for example, currently made in Europe-- easy to manufacture in the USA ASAP, but the arabica that is used for all instant coffee is grown in Vietnam, which now just went up in price by 46%. Cocoa, which has been smacked by bad weather the last year, is about to spike. Vanilla, fucking dildos, figure out a niche and arb that shit.

I find it very interesting that there isn't a ton of people talking about the connection between coffee/caffeine and weight gain due to chronically elevated cortisol. This video dives into the connection between caffeine and increased cortisol which leads to anxiety, stress, and abdominal fat. Since quitting coffee and energy drinks and switching to 1 cup of green tea just 4 days ago, I already look trimmer around the midsection. Could be a lot of water weight loss but this video keep me motivated to keep going! 

Health experts and articles always claim that caffeine helps suppress the appetite. Drinking coffee does suppress my appetite for a few hours but I do find that once the effects wear off and I start to crash, I get anxious and tired and then crave sugar and salty junk food like a mad man. While on 1 cup of green tea I can think rationally about what I eat and I honestly have been less hungry throughout the day, and especially at night when I would normally crave junk food. I'm just not that hungry.

Good luck y'all.",4,1744006742.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

Or would a breakup be better for both of us?","throwaway for obvious reasons

How can I communicate my feelings about her clinginess and the lack of respect for my boundaries without pushing her away or hurting her feelings? Or would a breakup be better for both of us?

TL;DR: My girlfriend \[19F\] is very clingy, dismissive of my boundaries, and often gets involved in drama. I want to move back to home state after I finish my Military contract she wants to stay in the state im stationed

I started dating this girl roughly 3 months ago, we met on duet. The conversation was easy and we found our self's at a local coffee shop 2 weeks later we started dating.

Early on into the relationship I felt she was a little to clingy at times, always wanted to be on facetime or together, the only time we wouldn't be on facetime is when either of us had to work. Within the first week of dating her she told me she loved me and I felt like that if I didn't say it back it would result in an argument or some sort of situation that left us both feeling upset so I said it back. she feels like I always need to give her attention regardless of what we are doing for example we were at our friends house the other day and she became upset that I was interacting with my buddy instead of her.

Recently I've started to notice it feels like everything is about her when she comes over its always what she wants to watch or what she wants to eat. When we talk its always about how her day was or what she did. I honestly cant remember when she's asked my input on something or how my day was. I feel like when I do try to talk about my day or self she's rather dismissive and cuts me off or waits till I'm finished to go back to talking about her self. It leaves me feeling upset and unheard. When I tried to bring this up to her she brushes it off or gets defensive about it saying things like ""well you always want to do what I want"" or she apologizes and says she wont do it again.

I feel like when we talk about some of my boundaries she agrees to them will apply them fir a couple of days before going back to what she was doing/how she was treating me. for example Im in the military and due to such I cant smoke or be around weed as it could result in me getting kicked out or charged under UCMJ. She smoked at our friends house with her friends before I got there and reeked of weed, Ive told her before that when she smoked weed I don't want to hug or kiss her due to the smell transfer as I still have to go back to a military base trough a controlled access point that has Military police/Security working it. she said she understands but yet every time she smokes and im around she ignores what I have previously told her to the point that people at the gate have commented on it and searched me and my car.

I also feel like she takes her anger and bad days at work out on me, she has hit me before in a playful way but when she's upset or angry its definitely not playful and has resulted in me telling her to stop which she usually does. Ive tried explain to her that when she does this it upsets me im not the cause of her bad day or anger. Her response to that was literally ""I feel like sometimes when I vent it comes across as anger to the person im ranting to"". I then gave her examples of how that wasn't true and she brushed it off saying I was being sensitive

Lastly She regularly finds her self in drama that is easily avoidable or easily ignorable the other day he and another guy got into an argument about an ex they share because the ex bumped into my girlfriend at a public place, the girl that's dating him/was dating him before my girlfriend dated her started to text my girlfriend the next morning saying some messed up things to her and threating to fight her, instead of block and ignoring her like I told her to do she proceeded to feed into it and go back an fourth with this girl over text to the point where she was telling the other girl to show up to where we were gonna be the next day to fight. She later told me everything and I was upset about it I told her that she should have just ignored and blocked her instead of giving her the reaction she was looking for and furthermore that if she did show up I was leaving because I don't want to be around that/risk my career over some drama that shouldn't have even happened. she then got upset at me saying I wasn't on her side and that im supposed to be agreeing with her and backing her up if something did happen.

Another thing thats not that important but still now sure how to approach, I want to move back to my home state when I get out she doesn't want to move it feels like we are at an impass and I dont know what to do about it",1,1744006721.0,relationship_advice,2,0.66,False

#  Understanding the Remote Worker’s Productivity Challenges in Coworking Spaces 

* While coworking spaces provide shape and network, they also gift precise challenges: 
* Environmental distractions like conversations, occasions, and foot traffic 
* Lack of habitual compared to domestic or non-public workplace setups 
* Over-networking that interrupts work rhythms

 Inconsistent workspace availability To conquer those, far off employees must undertake intentional strategies that permit them to stability flexibility with area. **1. Strategic Workspace Selection** Productivity begins with deciding on the right surroundings. Coworking spaces usually provide various zones: 

* Hot desks for short-term use 
* Dedicated desks for constant setups 
* Quiet zones for deep paintings 
* Collaborative lounges for networking and group duties 



# 2. Time management with time-furious techniques 

Time-blocking involves dividing its working day into concentrated chunks, providing specific functions in each block. It creates a structure in an otherwise fluid work environment. 

# 3. Digital equipment for distraction control 

Distance workers in colleagues space are susceptible to digital and physical distraction. The key is to reduce the obstacles without separating itself. Recommended Equipment: 

* Freedom: Block distracting apps and websites Perception 

* Slack Not disturb mode: Non-essential pingu during deep work Hack: Set the notification-free hour each day where you silence everything except emergency communication. 

# 4. Personalize your field Even in a shared office

 personal touch can create a sense of stability and meditation: Bring a small plant, your own ergonomic accessories, or inspiring notes Use blue light filters for screen to reduce eye stress Keep the necessary equipment within access to avoid continuous movement.

# 5. Management of social interaction wisely

 Co -workers thrive on the community, but excessive socialization can damage your workflow. Hack: Install social ""office time"" - you are open for chatting and you are in focus mode. When you are unavailable to obstruction, a simple view cu (eg, wearing a headphone) signal. 

# 6. Take advantage of meeting room 

Most colleagues provide private meeting chambers and soundproof pods. Hack: Do not limit them to meetings. Use them for concentrated tasks like writing, coding or strategic plan. Book in advance during your high performance hours. 

# 7. Establishment of a consistent routine 

Distance work can blur the lines between individual and business life. Establishing a clear routine adds the structure: Start daily at the same time Use a pre-functioning ritual (coffee, music, or jernling) to cu your brain Log out and leave the scope at a consistent time Hack: Track your energy patterns and align high-focus work during your peak hours-usually at mid-ear or noon.

#  8. Health and welfare integration 

Physical and mental health affects productivity. Many colleagues offer office health centered facilities. Hack: Participate in yoga or meditation sessions when available Take a walking break to focus your attention Stay hydrated and avoid relying too much on caffeine.

# 9. Weekly reflection and adjustment Productivity is dynamic

What works in a week, the project may not do the next work due to change, workload or personal life change. Hack: At the end of every week, reflect on it: Did the tasks take longer than expected? What time were the most productive? What was distracted? Adjust your field selection, schedule or equipment accordingly. 

# Conclusion

 Designing a system for permanent productivity In a colleague spaces, there is no more productivity for remote workers - it is about doing smart work in a favorable environment. By making routine, choosing the right tools and determining boundaries within a flexible system, remote professionals can thrive in these shared hubs. The colleague spaces are designed to empower freedom and cooperation - and with the right hack, they can become the final productivity playground for modern distance workers.",1,1744006706.0,u_heileyoffices,0,1.0,False
