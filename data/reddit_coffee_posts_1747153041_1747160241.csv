I was thinking maybe some produce storage or wine racks? Although we do have a buffet that we'll be using as a bar in the other room, so not sure we would need the additional wine storage, just a thought on something that could look nice.

On average, I’m getting like 5-6 hours of broken sleep a night. Not upset about that, I know what I signed up for having babies.

My husband on the other hand will not have less than 9 hours and he is so grumpy when I wake him up. He never wakes up in the middle of the night to take care of the kids. He does work late, but I always make sure he gets a full night before we go in for “daddy wake up time.” That’s where me and the kids go in and give him hugs and kisses to wake him up nicely. If we don’t do this he will easily sleep 12 hours. We basically get 2 hours with him before he goes to work. And he doesn’t drink coffee the first hour he is awake so he is insufferably grumpy so we usually get one good hour with him.

I can’t help but feel like I’m doing this on my own. He never eats with us, goes for walks with us, helps with the kids. I just feel alone when I thought we were doing this together. I’m getting mad at him lately and he can’t understand why I’m pissed he won’t be more present in our family. I only really see the worst side of him.

1klspkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigGirlDiary/comments/1klspkx/51325_in_her_image/,"5.13.25: ""In Her Image""","It's her face that waits for me in the mirror - cold, unforgiving eyes, a mouth that could slice with a single word. My face, but hers too. I used to think I could escape it, that I was nothing like her. I feel it now, twisting beneath my skin, a heaviness I can’t shake. Not anger, not bitterness - something worse. Recognition.

“Perfect.” That was her name before it was anything else. Perfect makeup, perfect hair, a perfect smile that never wavered. The same perfume for as long as I can remember - Dior J'adore, a scent that clung to her like an oath, bright with blood orange, softened by rose, sharp with neroli. A scent that lingered in doorways, in the folds of her scarves, a signature she never changed.

Her hair was a controlled wave of dark curls, always the same - short, meticulously shaped, the ends curling neatly as though even her hair understood it wasn’t allowed to be wild. She wasn’t tall, but she seemed to rise above everything - poised, spine straight, her presence pressing against you like a quiet, invisible weight.

She dressed in subtle perfection - silk blouses that hushed against her skin, trousers pressed so sharply they seemed sculpted, dresses that fit just enough to flatter but no chance to tempt. Nothing was ever out of place. Nothing ever dared. 

Even in anger, her voice was a quiet blade, a soft, measured murmur that could cut you without raising above a whisper. Her gaze never wavered, her expression a mask that never cracked. I never saw her falter, never saw her cry. She wasn’t just a person - she was a principle, something perfect and unreachable.

Her silence wasn’t just an absence, it was a shield, a threat, a bruise you couldn’t see.

There were glimpses - brief, trembling things I didn’t truly understand. The way she hovered in doorways, staring into nothingness. The slight quiver in her fingers before she wrapped them around her coffee. I never saw her break down. Maybe she never had the time.

She was born into a family of seamstresses - women who learned to make perfection with nothing but their hands, who knew that one crooked stitch could mean starting over. Magnificence was more than an option - it was a mandate. Fashion became her altar, every stitch a vow, every hem a testament that nothing out of place would ever be forgiven.

Her mother taught her perfection - silent stitches, whispered corrections. And now she taught it to me - without words, without mercy.

I think back to the time she snatched the comb from my hand, her fingers precise, smooth, perfect - like a lesson, like a law.

I remember the way she adjusted my collar before school, her fingers pressing out invisible wrinkles - like she could iron out my flaws, smooth away my chaos. The way she looked at me - like I was something she needed to fix.

Now, when I smell Dior J'adore, it’s like an apparition - a phantom touch that lingers just out of reach. Sometimes it feels like comfort, a whisper of something familiar. Other times, it’s a heaviness, pressing against my chest, a reminder of every moment I tried and failed to meet her expectations. 

I used to resent her for that. For never breaking, for never letting me see her flaws. I wanted to know she was human, that she hurt too, that she wasn’t just this perfect mask. But now, I wonder if that mask was her own armor - if it was how she survived, how she kept herself safe.

Her perfection wasn’t just a preference - it was a sentence she served, a burden she couldn’t set down. Something she inherited -  an obligation she carried because letting go meant losing everything.

For a long time, I thought understanding her meant forgiveness - an erasure of the hurt she caused, a softening of the edges. But I realize now, understanding isn’t absolution. It’s recognition. It’s seeing the chains she wore and knowing I inherited some of them.

I used to think accepting her meant pardoning her. But maybe it’s simpler than that. Maybe it’s just recognizing that she was as trapped as I felt - bound by expectations, suffocated by the need to be perfect. I see it now, not as a volition she made to torment me, but as a survival tactic. And in that recognition, I feel something softer - a quiet, reluctant empathy.

I was a riot in silk and sequins - long, bright blonde hair spilling over my shoulders, vibrant lipstick that left marks on coffee cups and strangers. I didn’t just exist - I demanded to be seen. I swore I’d never be like her - pristine and preserved, a doll in a glass case, flawless and frozen.

But she’s there now, a voice I can’t silence. 

Not the perfect surface I used to feel betrayed by, but the quiet determination beneath it - the need to be strong, to be in control, to keep everything from falling apart. The fear that if I’m not flawless, I don’t exist.

I swore I wouldn’t become her. I swore I would be softer, kinder. But sometimes I catch myself - my voice a little too sharp, my patience a little too thin. I see the way I choose distance over vulnerability, because vulnerability means someone might see the parts of me I can’t quite accept.

But I don’t harbor resentment toward her. Not anymore. Because I understand her now - understand the strength it took to be perfect, to be the pillar everyone leaned on. I understand that maybe she didn’t show me softness because she didn’t know how, because tenderness meant breaking, and she didn’t have the luxury of losing composure.

I look at myself, and I see her there - not as a ghost, not as a shadow, but as a reflection of the lessons she passed on. Some I needed, some I didn’t. But all of them shaped me.

I don’t want to morph into her. But escape feels impossible. I don’t hate her. Not anymore. But I don’t know how to love her either.

I thought I was running from her. 

But I was just becoming her - thread by thread, stitch by stitch.

1klsln6,https://www.reddit.com/r/zodiacacademy/comments/1klsln6/my_thoughts_on_zodiac_academy_as_a_whole/,My thoughts on Zodiac Academy as a whole,"FULL SPOILERS review as someone who binged books 1-7 in two weeks then took an entire YEAR for 8, 8.5, & 9

*DISCLAIMER* it’s going to be long…

## -Multiple POVs
Unpopular opinion but I liked it. I loved getting inside the heads of so many characters. It gave a broader, more layered view of the world.

## -Audiobooks 
They’re just bad, sorry. Bridget feels like she’s on the verge of tears the entire time and Jake is shouting everything at me- gave me a headache. And don’t get me started on the accents and Geraldine’s chapters.

## -the “bad writing”
The series is not badly written. It’s not gold, but it’s not trash. Let me explain. When characters have full arcs, depth, identities, motivations… when the worldbuilding actually pulls me into the universe and makes me _believe_ it? It’s good writing. I admit the first couple of books were cringy but there’s a reason most of us looked past it and moved on to finish the series. 

For example, compare ZA to Fourth Wing where there are so many plot holes/ retcons/ things that weren’t prior established just appearing and people taking it at face value… or the thousands of faceless side characters that have zero personality and I forget them as soon as I finish reading their names… that’s bad writing to me. Now Zodiac Academy is one of the few series that have a big number of main characters but they make it work. Each and every one of them exist and have a place in my brain because the authors distinguished them enough from one another/ made them all uniquely interesting to keep and hold my attention. That’s not bad writing. 

## -Best couple
💙Bluelance, by far. They absolutely wear the crown. Their first kiss in the pool? I will never be over it. Runner up are Seth and Caleb- hilarious and so passionate. ToryxDarius is not my favorite ship, but I do admit they have some of the hottest scenes (cave, threesome, throne and literally the whole star crossed storyline). I recognize that it’s a well done slow-burn enemies-to-lovers but to me, it took too long for them to get together and I lost interest. 🤷‍♀️

## -The twins
Both amazing, both kicking ass main characters. I love how much they love each other- how there’s zero competition between them 💯 Although I do prefer Darcy as Tory’s attitude kept pissing me off. The resting bitch attitude where she’s rude to everyone including her husband got old, sorry. In character though, I do understand why she’s like that, I just don’t like it. But she was also absolutely right saying no to Darius under the stars. _”I’d rather be alone”_ broke me.

## -ORIO
My love. I usually HATE teacher/ student trope but they made it work. He’s completely bewitched me- everything about him. His strength, his softness, his loyalty. How nerdy he is about books (we’re the same buddy), how passionate he is about PitBall (LOVE that he made Darcy a player and Tory a cheerleader LOL) and I know he’s literally the Cardinal Magic professor but the way he so expertly uses his magic… *blushes*. The part where he taught Darcy how to grow back her hair… *blushes even more*. He’s better than Rhysand. (I said it).

## -The Heirs
DARIUS 
He imo has one of the best character arcs in fiction- his growth is _twew_ good to see, but it took too long. I feel he’s basically had to die in order for him to bow and it rubbed me the wrong way. Orion wasn’t instantly swayed by the Queens’ birthright either but he did come to his senses quicker. Like how can you worship your woman but still can’t see her as your queen even after seeing her lead for three books (looking at you, book 7). Also hate that he calls Tory Roxy and Darcy Gwen. 

SETH 
He is my fave Heir. His growth was good to see too. Funny, charming, wild, unhinged, 100% girly pop… He is so unapologetically himself I love seeing him on page. So refreshing for a fictional man to not have the whole macho identity. Funny thing, I hated him the most. The hair cutting was unforgivable, the blackmailing too. The balcony scene where he apologized to Darcy but then it all turned sour- I remember thinking how the hell am I ever gonna love this guy. I still don’t know but the switch was there. 

CALEB. Love him too, love his style, his hair, and even his perfect date😆 Such a diva, I’d probably go out with him irl. He’s the first one to appear as ***morally grey*** (all the Heirs were straight up villains in the earlier books except for him, bcs of his relationship with Tory) and I appreciated his character deeply. He’s the perfect match for Seth and they deserve nothing but happiness. 

MAX
Took me a while to love him because I didn’t KNOW him for the longest time. But he has his moments: when he saved Tory from the shadows, literally every scene with Gerry, and his family dynamic is so cool. Actually, that’s something this series did really well: showing each Heir’s family background. Max’s is totally different from Caleb’s, which is different from Seth’s, and of course, Darius’s trauma speaks for itself. Those layers made them feel *real.*

## -Other characters 
GERALDINE
She’s the best. I liked her since her intro even if they painted her as lame in the earlier books. When she dyed her hair red for Angelica… Love you queen, slay.

DIEGO
I fear we moved on from him too fast. Tory and Orio were too harsh on him too.

XAVIER
Love his poly relationship with Sofia and Tyler but damn did he have the most embarrassing chapters. I love how he fully came into himself and became a gorgeous stallion at the end but until then I feel the authors kept pushing him as a lesser version of Darius and it pissed me off.

MILTON
Such a random character that suddenly had a backstory and amazing storyline. Was gutted when his girl died tho.

# THE SLUMP BEGINS
## -BOOK 8: when things started to drag. 
The series delivered the most gut wrenching, feet kicking, burn-the-books emotional torment I’ve ever experienced… but. At some point, ***enough.*** Let me explain. By the fourth one, books became 700+ then 1000+ pages and for what? I didn’t feel it drag til book 8 honestly, when it put me in the worst reading slump of my entire life. Both 8 and 8.5 were the struggles of my life & I know I could have just dropped the series but I cared about the characters too much to leave it unfinished. 

It’s not even the number of pages that make it drag so much, it’s how the plot ***stalled.*** By book 8 none of the villains were defeated. If Lavinia died in book 8 then we left *Dragon Who Burned* to the last book, that would have been a huge improvement already because at least it would’ve felt like **progress.** But there was basically *zero* progress in book 8. 

Darcy and Orion (my faves if it wasn’t obvious) were captive and did NOTHING the entire book! Come on. So boring. Tory’s quest to revive Darius was also boring. It took TOO LONG. This book as a whole is too long. I felt like her POV chapters were just endless inner monologues and ranting (grieving LOL) about how the stars are unfair and she’s going to find a way to bring him back and like OK?? When? ‘Cos we’ve been on the same page, stuck in the same emotional beat, for 70 chapters. That’s also a trend in many book series not just ZA btw, where the book is mostly filler than stuff happen the last 10%. That’s bad pacing and bad writing, that’s where you lose readers.

## -8.5—my nightmare. 
I don’t even want to talk about it but I will if only to save someone else from the pain. Listen, if you plan to take a long break between 8 and 9 then fine, you can pick it up. HOWEVER, if you’re bingeing the series, **ABORT.** DO NOT read 8.5! It removed my will to live (I’m being dramatic but this is the only way to make a point these days). The book is 400+ pages (again too long for a NOVELLA) and was basically a retelling of book 8 (which also was a boring book, so by that logic how would 8.5 be any better? I should have known better!). 

There are few things I liked though: Azrael Orion (I got a crush on him *ze same as Lancelot),* The banter between Hail and Darius was fun but again, at some point we have enough. The story about the guild stones was really interesting but could have been a novella apart without the whole retelling. And if it wasn’t a retelling of an event from book 8 from someone else’s POV, it’s the same conversation that Darius has with every single person beyond the veil, **repeatedly.** *“You have to accept that you’re dead”. “No, I won’t, I will find a way out”. “No, accept it”.* Guys, I get it, believe me I do, got it the first time.

Darius is mostly the one who pissed me off, maybe I don’t like him without Tory? Idk but I was tired of his alphahole mentality since book 3 and a whole book Darius POV was not on my 2024 bingo card. The scene where he was trapped in the room with Seth and Caleb banging was iconic tho. Comedy gold. I’ll give it that.

## -BOOK 9: the fatigue. 
Why would they introduce a new villain at this point in the series? Clydinius was so unnecessary and just felt like filler if it wasn’t for breaking the Vega curse. Did we really need this curse tho? Book 9 in general dragged too, and I have an example. The scene where Mildred kidnaps Geraldine should be action-packed, but was instead dragged across multiple chapters and had to be seen from the POV of multiple people. Why am I reading _ten different reactions to the same event?_ Just ACT. Save her. Move on. 

On the plus side: the deaths in this book were satisfying. Darcy & Orion for Lavinia + Darius & Tharix (LMAO best combo) and Tory for the dragon eggplant was so satisfying. Valg’s capture was good too. However, I know I said before that I liked the multiple POVs but whyyyy did we get so many of Dragon pig??? Why? And it’s the same over and over again _(they have outsmarted me but I will not let it happen I will strike them back twice as hard and the daughters of my enemies will perish bla blaaa)_ OK I get it!!! We didn’t need so much—we didn’t need ANYTHING—from Lame Lionel…

I hope you’re having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I’m reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands — ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

**A little about me:**

* I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over a decade now.
* I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit — but also never say no to dessert.
* I’d be happy to host or come to you — whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
* I love being outside, especially in the summer — picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
* Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams — I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
* I’m a good listener — friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
* Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me — I value both deeply.
* I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

**What I’m looking for:**

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with — whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends — movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine — your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh — I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

Let’s make a little space in this busy world for warmth and connection.

**My Preference:** I'm hoping you weigh below 60 kg. There's a silly reason behind this and I will tell you on message 😁

1klsidp,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1klsidp/i_broke_into_the_wrong_house_now_people_in_town/,"I broke into the wrong house, now people in town are disappearing","The house sat alone at the edge of town, lit by golden windows and a tasteful porch lantern. It belonged to the Hawthornes. They were the kind of family people named buildings after. Wealthy. Well-liked. I actually used to be friends with one of their kids back during grade school.

Unfortunately, life for me didn’t go as swimmingly. And although I’d never broken into a home I’d once been invited to, jobs around Rynnville were fleeting, and I needed a bigger score than usual to carry me out of this town.

And it’s not my fault. No. The Hawthornes were the ones who basically killed Rynnville. They had stock in every business that started here — tech startups, green energy projects, even a damn syrup bottling plant. They were globally recognized before their stupid divorce and the disappearance of Mrs. Hawthorne shortly after.

It was easy to assume that was Mr. Hawthorne’s doing — but she was one of seventeen who went missing that month. Sixteen of them had no ties to the man at all. So he took his kids and left. Business followed him. And what little industry had taken root here dried up and blew away like everything else. The most stable job now is at the dollar store.

It’s a great, quiet place for hunting cabins. But those of us who live here? We have a 45-minute commute to stock shelves at Walmart.

So yeah — the Hawthornes can suck a fat one.

But you already know the upside: they hardly ever visit their old home. Maybe a few days every couple of months. And it’s only ever Mr. Hawthorne.

Outside of that, the house is patrolled by two security guards — which used to worry me. But it’s clear they’re not actually doing full sweeps. Just two lazy men with sidearms who get paid to lounge in a mansion and look intimidating. I mean, who would break into a house with security vehicles parked out front, right?

Well, when you watch the place for half a year, you notice things.

Seven out of eight security cameras have red lights. Three of those have ivy or spiderwebs obscuring their lenses. The same porch light’s been flickering since February. The back patio entrance? Basic pin tumbler lock. Child’s play.

But what caught my eye — what really *lingered* — were the windows.

The east side of the basement has two narrow rectangular windows, just above ground level. Not only are they locked, but nailed shut — thick, black iron nails sunk into the brick. 

And those same two windows? The room behind them only lit up twice in six months. Both times when Mr. Hawthorne was in town. The room containing the only thing valuable enough for the pompous billionaire prick to come back to town.

Two weeks ago, there were no lights. No guards awake. No Hawthornes. I’d made my decision.

I rounded through the woods in a wide arc to reach a small hole I’d cut into the fence months ago, hidden behind a few overgrown bushes. The grass was damp, but the air was still. I crept along the perimeter until I reached the blind spot of the one security camera without a red light, just in case it still had power.

From there, it was only a few careful shuffles to the left before I ducked under the patio. I knelt in the shadows and planted my Wi-Fi jammer, flicked it on, and tuned the frequency. It wouldn’t reach the cameras in front, but it would be enough to scramble the feeds and alerts tied to the three back exits I’d been casing for months, a tight escape net if things went wrong.

I chose the sliding glass patio door over the garage side entrance. Both were near staircases, but this one led toward the kitchen and living room, then the basement door beyond that. The garage entrance connected too closely to the bedrooms. I figured if the guards were still awake, they’d be planted on couches somewhere, nodding off to late-night TV. But the house was dark. Dead quiet. No action in the living room through the windows, so it was best to prioritize steering clear of the steps by the bedrooms.

The lock gave with barely a whisper. Thirty seconds, maybe less. I slipped inside, eased the door shut, and clicked the lock behind me.

The kitchen smelled like dust and stale coffee. My steps were slow, controlled, sliding forward on the balls of my feet. Every creak in the old wood floor felt too loud in the silence.

Past the marble island and the spotless stovetop, through the archway into the dining room — long table, high-backed chairs, no signs of life, and then I turned.

A narrow door just off to the side, tucked between built-in cabinetry. I opened it. The air that wafted up from below was cold and dry, with a strange coppery edge. I stepped through and shut the door behind me.

The stairs groaned more than I expected.

I froze. Waited. Counted to twenty. Nothing.

Then I descended.

 The basement smelled... different. Not like mildew or old laundry. It was sterile. Bleach. But strangely, it still looked the same as it had when I was a second grader coming over for birthday parties.

I’d stepped into the main entertainment space, two large rectangular rooms joined in an L-shape. Aside from the stairs behind me, if I followed the wall at my back to the left, I’d reach the hallway that led to the second staircase and a full bathroom.

The door I wanted, the one that led to the room with the nailed windows, sat dead center on the wall that ran alongside the hallway, only about twenty-five feet from where I stood. Close enough to the stairs. Close enough to my exit — the same way I came in.

Unfortunately, that meant it was in full view of anyone coming down from the other staircase.

If someone entered from that end, my only chance was to dive behind the big leather recliner in the far corner, where a cluster of fake plants and a side table offered some cover. I made a mental note of the escape route and the hiding spot, then crept toward the thick, dark oak door.

The lock was trickier than I expected. Forty-five seconds of quiet work before I got the pins to fall. “Bingo,” I muttered.

The door creaked as I eased it open. But I didn’t stop when it was wide enough to slip through. I pushed it farther than I needed to, maybe too far. Maybe that was my mistake. A better thief wouldn’t have hesitated.

Since that night, I haven’t opened a door all the way. Not even halfway. I don’t think I ever will again.

As the angle neared ninety degrees, something gritty scraped beneath the door, a faint drag, like grains of sand. Or salt.

Then I heard it.

Footsteps**.**

Bare feet, slapping against tile. Then softer. On carpet.

The second staircase. Someone was coming down.

I shut the door as gently as I could and sprinted on the balls of my feet, ducking behind the recliner and crouching low behind the fake ferns and dusty side table.

And I held my breath.

A burly man flicked on the stairwell light. He muttered over his shoulder to someone I couldn’t see — clearly the other guard.

“It was probably nothing, man. The dust triggers this shit all the time. Just check the kitchen.”

A laser system. 

You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.

I didn’t understand why it was necessary yet. But I would. Very soon.

The man trudged down the hall, thankfully too lazy or groggy to flip on any more lights. The only one lit was the stairwell, casting his silhouette deep into the room. His shadow reached the floor just a few feet from my hiding spot. Then he stopped.

He was barefoot and wearing sleep attire, the only thing that marked him as a guard was the sidearm at his waist. He scrunched his toes in the carpet and bent down, brow furrowed, picking something up.

A speck.A grain.

“The barrier,” he muttered. The words barely made it out, half-gasped, half-whispered.

My gut twisted.  
  


He was about to figure it out.., that someone had disturbed whatever the hell that gritty stuff was.

Salt. Sand. Rice maybe.

He straightened slowly, put his ear to the door, left hand on the knob. His right unclipped the holster at his hip.

*You fucking idiot.* I blamed myself.

I forgot to relock the door, and it was going to raise all of his alarms.

My self-loathing swelled even as the rational part of me reasoned that there hadn’t been time to lock it.But it didn’t matter. He’d know.He’d open it and I’d be—

**CRASH**

The center of the oak door exploded inward, a shriek of splintered wood and ragged force.

Two long, bone-thin arms burst through — grey with decay, slick with sinew, mottled with sores that wept pus and rot. Fingers like snapped branches lashed out, tipped with yellowed nails crusted in dirt and old blood.

The guard didn’t scream. His breath caught in his throat.

The thing’s knuckled hands clamped around his waist — not his chest, not his legs — his waist, like it meant to fold him in half.

Then it did.

A sickening snap echoed through the room as his spine bent backward. He didn’t even cry out.

His eyes locked with mine across the room — wide, horrified, searching for something. For help. He was sputtering out blood, gawing.

The arms continued to pull.

It yanked him by his ruined waist into the splintered hole, forcing him through like a toddler jamming the square block into the round hole of a toy.

The jagged wood peeled him as he went — his face dragging against splinters, his ankles twitching and twisting beneath his head, desperate to follow the rest of him through. Then a wet thud as he hit the floor on the other side.

Silence.

Then the door creaked open.

And *it* stepped out.

Shambling. Tall. Hunched**.**

Its limbs were too long, not inhuman in design, but wrong in proportion. Its spine pushed against the skin of its back like something trying to emerge. The hair on its scalp hung in greasy, stringy mats — the kind that looked like it would all come off in one slick wipe.

Then I saw its face.

Or what was left of it.

A slack, dangling jaw crowded with teeth, some animal, some jagged, and some familiar. Human.

But what hit me hardest wasn’t the teeth.

It was the bracelet.

Delicate silver links with a small amber stone — the kind a kid remembers because it looks like something no one else’s mom ever wore. Paired with a ring I hadn’t seen since I was eight.

A massive diamond, the most expensive thing I’d ever laid eyes on back then.

Mrs. Hawthorne.

Scanning the room, the *Hawthorne-thing* nearly locked eyes with me.

Her gaze drifted, slow and dragging, pupils wide and black, swallowing what should have been her irises. Those empty eyes crept closer to my hiding spot, like she could feel me. Sense me. Could she smell the piss running down my leg?

Then… A yelp. From the stairs. The other guard.

Her head snapped toward the sound with a twitch so fast it barely registered — less like turning and more like a glitch.

He was gone around the corner, running. I heard him throw down stools in the kitchen to cover his escape.

Then she was off.

She bolted for the stairs, slamming into the walls as she went. The sound of her sprint — no, something faster than — rattled the floorboards.

Inconceivably fast.

Then came the tearing.., wet, violent. A splash of glass shattering. And finally:

The alarm.

I gave it a minute.

The police station was in the center of town, and I wasn’t about to be the next body bag just because I didn’t want to bump into the cops.

When I finally moved, I tightened the strings on my hoodie and sprinted out the front door. No way in hell was I cutting through the woods — not with Mrs. Hawthorne somewhere out there.

Four minutes later, lungs burning, I heard the sirens. As they rounded the corner, I dove into a ditch and held my breath while the cruisers roared past.

By the time I made it back to my car, parked behind the old bottling factory, I spotted police units from the next town over tearing through the main road.

The house burned down by the end of the week.

I don’t know what the police know. But they’re not telling the town the truth.

Two young girls went missing that Thursday. Last time they were spotted was the swing set behind the elementary school. On Saturday, they found an abandoned car out by Observatory Park, near the edge of town. Blood on the dash. Signs of a struggle.

There’s still a few people who haven’t officially been reported missing, but their families are posting, asking if anyone has heard from them recently.

During one of the search parties, a sheriff never came back. Just didn’t return.

And in the last seven days, judging by Facebook posts, eleven pets have vanished. Dogs. Cats. Even a parrot, someone said.

I want to leave. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to run.

But they’ve issued a stay-at-home order.

So now I’m stuck here.

What the fuck do I do?

A narrow door just off to the side, tucked between built-in cabinetry. I opened it. The air that wafted up from below was cold and dry, with a strange coppery edge. I stepped through and shut the door behind me.

The stairs groaned more than I expected.

I froze. Waited. Counted to twenty. Nothing.

Then I descended.

 The basement smelled... different. Not like mildew or old laundry. It was sterile. Bleach. But strangely, it still looked the same as it had when I was a second grader coming over for birthday parties.

I’d stepped into the main entertainment space, two large rectangular rooms joined in an L-shape. Aside from the stairs behind me, if I followed the wall at my back to the left, I’d reach the hallway that led to the second staircase and a full bathroom.

The door I wanted, the one that led to the room with the nailed windows, sat dead center on the wall that ran alongside the hallway, only about twenty-five feet from where I stood. Close enough to the stairs. Close enough to my exit — the same way I came in.

Unfortunately, that meant it was in full view of anyone coming down from the other staircase.

If someone entered from that end, my only chance was to dive behind the big leather recliner in the far corner, where a cluster of fake plants and a side table offered some cover. I made a mental note of the escape route and the hiding spot, then crept toward the thick, dark oak door.

The lock was trickier than I expected. Forty-five seconds of quiet work before I got the pins to fall. “Bingo,” I muttered.

The door creaked as I eased it open. But I didn’t stop when it was wide enough to slip through. I pushed it farther than I needed to, maybe too far. Maybe that was my mistake. A better thief wouldn’t have hesitated.

Since that night, I haven’t opened a door all the way. Not even halfway. I don’t think I ever will again.

As the angle neared ninety degrees, something gritty scraped beneath the door, a faint drag, like grains of sand. Or salt.

Then I heard it.

Footsteps**.**

Bare feet, slapping against tile. Then softer. On carpet.

The second staircase. Someone was coming down.

I shut the door as gently as I could and sprinted on the balls of my feet, ducking behind the recliner and crouching low behind the fake ferns and dusty side table.

And I held my breath.

A burly man flicked on the stairwell light. He muttered over his shoulder to someone I couldn’t see — clearly the other guard.

“It was probably nothing, man. The dust triggers this shit all the time. Just check the kitchen.”

A laser system. 

You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.

I didn’t understand why it was necessary yet. But I would. Very soon.

The man trudged down the hall, thankfully too lazy or groggy to flip on any more lights. The only one lit was the stairwell, casting his silhouette deep into the room. His shadow reached the floor just a few feet from my hiding spot. Then he stopped.

He was barefoot and wearing sleep attire, the only thing that marked him as a guard was the sidearm at his waist. He scrunched his toes in the carpet and bent down, brow furrowed, picking something up.

A speck.A grain.

“The barrier,” he muttered. The words barely made it out, half-gasped, half-whispered.

My gut twisted.  
  


He was about to figure it out.., that someone had disturbed whatever the hell that gritty stuff was.

Salt. Sand. Rice maybe.

He straightened slowly, put his ear to the door, left hand on the knob. His right unclipped the holster at his hip.

*You fucking idiot.* I blamed myself.

I forgot to relock the door, and it was going to raise all of his alarms.

My self-loathing swelled even as the rational part of me reasoned that there hadn’t been time to lock it.But it didn’t matter. He’d know.He’d open it and I’d be—

**CRASH**

The center of the oak door exploded inward, a shriek of splintered wood and ragged force.

Two long, bone-thin arms burst through — grey with decay, slick with sinew, mottled with sores that wept pus and rot. Fingers like snapped branches lashed out, tipped with yellowed nails crusted in dirt and old blood.

The guard didn’t scream. His breath caught in his throat.

The thing’s knuckled hands clamped around his waist — not his chest, not his legs — his waist, like it meant to fold him in half.

Then it did.

A sickening snap echoed through the room as his spine bent backward. He didn’t even cry out.

His eyes locked with mine across the room — wide, horrified, searching for something. For help. He was sputtering out blood, gawing.

The arms continued to pull.

It yanked him by his ruined waist into the splintered hole, forcing him through like a toddler jamming the square block into the round hole of a toy.

The jagged wood peeled him as he went — his face dragging against splinters, his ankles twitching and twisting beneath his head, desperate to follow the rest of him through. Then a wet thud as he hit the floor on the other side.

Silence.

Then the door creaked open.

And *it* stepped out.

Shambling. Tall. Hunched**.**

Its limbs were too long, not inhuman in design, but wrong in proportion. Its spine pushed against the skin of its back like something trying to emerge. The hair on its scalp hung in greasy, stringy mats — the kind that looked like it would all come off in one slick wipe.

Then I saw its face.

Or what was left of it.

A slack, dangling jaw crowded with teeth, some animal, some jagged, and some familiar. Human.

But what hit me hardest wasn’t the teeth.

It was the bracelet.

Delicate silver links with a small amber stone — the kind a kid remembers because it looks like something no one else’s mom ever wore. Paired with a ring I hadn’t seen since I was eight.

A massive diamond, the most expensive thing I’d ever laid eyes on back then.

Mrs. Hawthorne.

Scanning the room, the *Hawthorne-thing* nearly locked eyes with me.

Her gaze drifted, slow and dragging, pupils wide and black, swallowing what should have been her irises. Those empty eyes crept closer to my hiding spot, like she could feel me. Sense me. Could she smell the piss running down my leg?

Then… A yelp. From the stairs. The other guard.

Her head snapped toward the sound with a twitch so fast it barely registered — less like turning and more like a glitch.

He was gone around the corner, running. I heard him throw down stools in the kitchen to cover his escape.

Then she was off.

She bolted for the stairs, slamming into the walls as she went. The sound of her sprint — no, something faster than — rattled the floorboards.

Inconceivably fast.

Then came the tearing.., wet, violent. A splash of glass shattering. And finally:

The alarm.

I gave it a minute.

The police station was in the center of town, and I wasn’t about to be the next body bag just because I didn’t want to bump into the cops.

When I finally moved, I tightened the strings on my hoodie and sprinted out the front door. No way in hell was I cutting through the woods — not with Mrs. Hawthorne somewhere out there.

Four minutes later, lungs burning, I heard the sirens. As they rounded the corner, I dove into a ditch and held my breath while the cruisers roared past.

By the time I made it back to my car, parked behind the old bottling factory, I spotted police units from the next town over tearing through the main road.

The house burned down by the end of the week.

I don’t know what the police know. But they’re not telling the town the truth.

Two young girls went missing that Thursday. Last time they were spotted was the swing set behind the elementary school. On Saturday, they found an abandoned car out by Observatory Park, near the edge of town. Blood on the dash. Signs of a struggle.

There’s still a few people who haven’t officially been reported missing, but their families are posting, asking if anyone has heard from them recently.

During one of the search parties, a sheriff never came back. Just didn’t return.

And in the last seven days, judging by Facebook posts, eleven pets have vanished. Dogs. Cats. Even a parrot, someone said.

I want to leave. Every instinct I have is screaming at me to run.

But they’ve issued a stay-at-home order.

So now I’m stuck here.

What the fuck do I do?

I just posted a question a few minutes ago regarding grinder and now I'd love to get some recommendation from you guys for a new espresso machine. 

Ideally I'd like to get something that's super easy to use since my wife who isn't into espresso will also use it. I personally mostly drink italian style espresso but light roast from time to time.

I was actually looking at the gaggia classic E24 since it looks solid and can be modded quite easily with the gaggimate mod. It would do everything i need. The only issue is the long warm up time especially for my wife since she likes to just go to the machine and get a coffee right away. She doens't really care about espresso quality.   
Woudl you think it's still fast enough to make something like an americano in a few minutes? 

The Gaggia is appealing  since it looks easy to fix and get spare parts if something breaks in a few years. I'd like something that lasts and is simple to repair. Maybe i missed an other machine? 

I've seen the rancilio silvia but it doesn't look that much better and is quite a bit bigger (we don't have much counter space).

Any other machine I should look into?

The cafe, called the West Art Coffee Bar, will be open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily, even on days when West Art has other events happening in one of its two main performance areas — City Hall on the first floor and the Sanctuary on the second floor.

There will be seating for around 70 people, and seating options range from booths and tables to couches and cushioned chairs.

The cafe, at 800 Buchanan Ave. in Lancaster, will serve coffee and espresso drinks from the Nostalgica Coffee roastery, wine from the Vine Bar and a variety of other local beers and alcoholic beverages, says Josh Gibbel, co-owner of West Art. There will be around 10 people on staff.

Its drink bar will feature around a dozen taps, eight of which will be for local beers, one for kombucha, one for cider and one for nitro cold brew. There will be a mix of ready-to-eat products from local businesses Elsewhere Bread and Front Porch Baking Co.

""The goal is to, from early in the morning to late into the evenings, to be a place where people can come together,"" says Gibbel.

Much of the furniture — including the menu board, the bar and some tables — is composed of donated or upcycled materials. That includes pieces of an organ from when West Art's building was St. Peter's United Church of Christ.

The organ featured both metal and wooden pipes. The metal pipes were unrolled and fit together to become the bar's facade, and the wooden pipes were used for the cafe's menu board and as the legs for some of the cafe's tables, says Gibbel.

""It's a mix of, like, modern and the history of the building, and then just some kind of whimsical little touches,"" Gibbel says.

In addition, there are also works on display and for sale from local artists such as Keisha Finnie, Jo Davis, Emily and Jake Nicolella, Leesha Epler and Joshua Beltre.

West Art closed in its entirety from mid-February to late-April to finish cafe renovations. Gibbel and co-owner Rufus Deakin declined to say how much the renovations cost, but did say that they personally did much of the renovations to keep costs in check.

Just wanted to share some useful tips I wish I would've known at the start of my journey as I'm rounding my goal weight.

1. Protein and fiber are SO important. Since they take longer for your body to process they keep you full way longer than ""empty calories would. I try to get 50% of my caloric intake from protein. While not always easy, 1 notice a huge difference in appetite when I'm down on protein one day

2. DIET SODA. DIET SODA. DIET SODA. Yes, I know it has been demonized for years and people claim it causes cancer and this and that, however more recent studies show that diet drinks are NOT in fact, the devil. These beauties help keep your fuller longer, help sweet cravings, and keep you hydrated if you're not a huge water drinker.

3. Whole Food Sources. I try to keep my diet consisting of mostly whole food sources. Not only are these just better for general health for a laundry list of reasons, they genuinely taste better, and you get a sense of accomplishment turning raw real ingredients into a healthy meal. The only processed foods I eat are protein bars/shakes and oikos yogurt.

4. Your tastebuds change drastically. Don't be afraid to try new or new to you healthy foods that you ""hated"" in the past. Once you start eating better and cut out all the processed sugar, your tastebuds will change drastically.There are a multitude of healthy foods that I could not stand before that I absolutely adore now.

5. I have always been a horrible late night snacker.
However contrary to popular belief, eating at night does NOT make you fat. As most on this subreddit have learned like myself, it's calories in-calories out. So what I try to do, is fast thru most of the day until afterwork(besides my morning black coffee and diet sodas)then instead of eating a huge meal when I get home, I'""l have two smaller meals spaced out by at least a few hours, and keep them small enough so that I have at least 30% of my allotted calories left for late night snacks. This has worked wonders for me.

If anyone has any other tips they have found useful for themselves please share below as I am also still learning new things every day and would love to hear what has worked for you all.

My name is Firman, and I’m a final-year Bachelor of Psychology (Hons.) student at Taylor’s University in Malaysia. For my final-year research project, I’m conducting a study to better understand how using online dating platforms—like Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel—might be related to social anxiety.

Specifically, in this study, I’m exploring how engagement with online dating platforms (like Tinder, Bumble, or Coffee Meets Bagel) is related to social anxiety in young adults. I’m particularly interested in whether fear of rejection and upward social comparisons (i.e., comparing yourself to others who seem more attractive or successful) help explain this relationship.

Understanding these psychological processes could offer insights into how online dating affects mental well-being—especially for people in this age group.

My problem:
Can’t lose weight for some reason

Summary:
Carnivore 2 months, 1 month without dairy (only cut it out because I wasn’t seeing progress). I roughly consume 2,000-3,000 calories per day but it varies a lot. I force myself to eat bacon egg and beef bowls for breakfast everyday (I don’t drain bacon grease or beef grease). I only have 2 meals per day (but sometimes snack on pork rinds throughout the day too). 

My diet: 
I eat primarily beef, eggs, and bacon, but I have fatty cuts of pork and dark meat chicken too. I rarely have deli meats anymore but if I do it’s pepperoni or salami. When I ate dairy I just had cheese and made carnivore ice cream a couple times. 

My weight:
I have maintained between 163 and 165 the entire time. Even after cutting out dairy (which is very hard for me to do. I don’t even want to do this diet anymore if I can’t have dairy). 

My drinks:
I drink black coffee, ICE drinks (carbonated water), water, and one Diet Coke a week. 

Do I cheat?:

1kls8pm,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1kls8pm/finally_gone/,Finally gone!,"Had my surgery yesterday and it was a success. It was supposed to happen at 1pm but didn't actually start until 3pm and something, it lasted less than an hour and I was sent to the recovery room. Surprisingly they also found an umbilical hernya and got it removed, which I'm thankful I won't need any more future surgery for lol. 
At first I woke up kind of groggy still in the surgery room, was sent to the recovery very thirsty and with a sore throat. After 30 to 40 minutes I was sent to my actual room in the hospital and allowed to drink water, the sore throat went away quite quickly after that (I bought some cough drops beforehand and I don't think I'll need them at all). 

The not fun part is that, because the surgery happened a little bit late, I had to stay there until this morning and since I expected to leave the same day it really threw me off, and I was kinda freaking out wanting to leave asap when I woke up and had to wait for a few hours. Sleeping at the hospital was tough, I am autistic and it's an unfamiliar environment with lots of noise and visits from nurses and I found myself waking up every 20 minutes all night long (didn't help that my room was in the maternity wing so I was also hearing babies crying all the time lmao).

At first I had some pain while taking deep breaths but that went away after a couple hours. Still having some gas pain and my belly is sore when I move it, especially while getting up and laying down but it's not the end of the world. I ate soup, crackers and bread with cottage cheese at the hospital and it went fine. Also had a little bit of tea and then milk and coffee in the morning. I was able to go pee on my own quite quickly and without any issues. I'm taking the recommended meds and they are helping, also was able to sleep a bit better after coming home which was awesome as I was very tired. A friend recommended chewing gum for the gas and I'm doing that too. 

While it's still very new, I'd say the experience is more positive than negative. I really wanted to get this over it, I could barely eat anything before surgery and even if I have some stomach issues in the future I think I'll at least be able to eat more foods.

Anyway, feel free to ask me anything if you haven't had your surgery yet, and best of luck to us all :) ",1,1747158085.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

I've worked here for a couple years and recently got promoted to manager. This is my first time in a leadership role and I’ve been trying to take it seriously. I prioritize cleanliness, organization, and professionalism and I want my employees to exhibit these qualities as well.

One of our part time employees, who I'll call J (21f), is a college student. She's a good worker, shows up on time, doesn’t complain, and is responsible. I have no issues with her job performance. But lately I’ve noticed that during the slower parts of the shift, usually mid afternoon when we might not see a customer for 20-30 minutes, she pulls out her notebooks to do homework. To be fair, she still helps customers if they come in and she doesn’t ignore her duties. But during downtime, she’s always doing schoolwork. 

I mentioned to her the other day that I didn’t think it was appropriate to do homework during her shift. I told her I get that it’s slow, but she’s still on the clock and it comes off as extremely unprofessional and that there's a time and place for homework. Her response was that other employees scroll on their phone during downtime and that this feels like the same thing, plus the previous manager was okay with her doing it. I explained to her that doing homework and being on your phone are different, but she didn't have much of a response and just said ""ok.""

Ever since this happened she’s been a little distant with me. I asked some of the other employees if they thought it was an issue and they all said no, she’s great and they don’t care. Another employee told me they think it's better for her to do homework than scroll on her phone like them (she is in school and they are not).

Someone (jokingly) said I was turning into a corporate manager and now I feel awkward. I don’t want to be the type of boss who takes things too seriously. But at the same time I feel like letting people work on personal stuff while clocked in is unprofessional and shouldn't be happening at work. It feels a little tense with J and I'm starting to wonder if I made a big deal out of nothing. AITA?",0,1747157922.0,managers,39,0.23,False

Nursing school had been a grueling marathon late nights memorizing drug classes, clinicals where my hands shook as I inserted my first IV, and a constant  fear of failing those I’d one day serve. My mom, a home health aide, was my rock, her words, “You were born to care,” echoing in my heart. But the NCLEX was my Goliath. My first attempt ended in a crushing defeat 150 questions, a blank screen, and an email confirming I’d fallen short. Doubt gnawed at me, amplified by social media posts of classmates celebrating their RN pins. Yet, I couldn’t quit. My mom pinned a note to my fridge: “Keep climbing.” I had to try again.

This time, I fought smarter. I joined a study group with James and Jennifer, two other NCLEX hopefuls who became my lifeline. Over coffee and flashcards, we quizzed each other, laughed at silly mnemonics, and shared our fears of failing again. I dove into Naxlex, dissecting every question until I could teach it. Mark Klimek’s lectures played on loop, his voice calming my panic. I journaled to silence the inner critic, practiced deep breathing, and leaned on my mom’s voicemails: “You’re stronger than this test.” By my third attempt, I walked into the Pearson VUE center with a quiet resolve. The questions flew 75, 100, 150 and the screen went blank. I left numb, haunted by every choice, bracing for another heartbreak.

Two days later, I sat on my couch, my mom beside me, her hand steadying mine. My heart pounded as I logged into the portal. One click, and there it was: “PASS.” I screamed, tears streaming, laughter bubbling up as my mom hugged me tight. I was an RN. Texts from Jennifer and James lit up my phone they’d passed too. The weight of years of self doubt, sleepless nights, and that relentless test lifted. As I prepare for my first shift, pinning my RN badge to my scrubs, I carry this journey like a badge of honor.

The NCLEX didn’t just test my knowledge; it forged my resilience. My dream is unlocked, and I’m ready to care, heal, and grow.",9,1747157897.0,NCLEXsuccessStories,17,1.0,False
1kls5fo,https://i.redd.it/njue81jd5l0f1.jpeg,Down 56lbs in just under 4 months. Here’s some tips that have helped along the way.,"
Just wanted to share some useful tips I wish I would’ve known at the start of my journey as I’m rounding my goal weight.

1) Protein and fiber are SO important. Since they take longer for your body to process they keep you full way longer than “empty calories would. I try to get 50% of my caloric intake from protein. While not always easy, I notice a huge difference in appetite .when I’m down on protein one day

2) DIET SODA. DIET SODA. DIET SODA. Yes, I know it has been demonized for years and people claim it causes cancer and this and that, however more recent studies show that diet drinks are NOT in fact, the devil. These beauties help keep your fuller longer, help sweet cravings, and keep you hydrated if you’re not a huge water drinker.

3) Whole Food Sources. I try to keep my diet consisting of mostly whole food sources. Not only are these just better for general health for a laundry list of reasons, they genuinely taste better, and you get a sense of accomplishment turning raw real ingredients into a healthy meal. The only processed foods I eat are protein bars/shakes and oikos yogurt.

4) Your tastebuds change drastically. Don’t be afraid to try new or new to you healthy foods that you “hated” in the past. Once you start eating better and cut out all the processed sugar, your tastebuds will change drastically. There are a multitude of healthy foods that I could not stand before that I absolutely adore now.

5) I have always been a horrible late night snacker. However contrary to popular belief, eating at night does NOT make you fat. As most on this subreddit have learned like myself, it’s calories in-calories out. So what I try to do, is fast thru most of the day until after work(besides my morning black coffee and diet sodas) then instead of eating a huge meal when I get home, I’ll have two smaller meals spaced out by at least a few hours, and keep them small enough so that I have at least 30% of my allotted calories left for late night snacks. This has worked wonders for me.

If anyone has any other tips they have found useful for themselves please share below as I am also still learning new things every day and would love to hear what has worked for you all. Thank you to this subreddit for motivating me to take control back of my life, and most likely extend my life by quite a bit.",18,1747157873.0,LoseitApp,5,1.0,False

The problem is my physical reaction. I was noticed twice behind the desk nodding by my coworkers and eventually reached my line manager's ears.

I tried drinking coffee, and the caffeine works a little in the morning, but I don't wanna be dependent on caffeine. Could it be possible sign of a symptomatic health issue? Even my manager suggested me to see a doctor!

Got the full version of the story. Say something in the comments and I’ll share.,"**I got home after a long day, and my parents were waiting for me in the living room.**

""Catherine, sit down. We need to talk,"" my father said, looking quite agitated.

""What's going on, Dad?"" I asked tiredly. I had worked all day, gone to college at night, and upon getting home, all I wanted was to take a shower and crash into bed. But that wasn't possible.

""Catherine, your cousin's wedding invitation has arrived,"" my mother said.

""That little tramp is not my cousin!"" I snapped, already getting angry.

""Catherine, she is your cousin,"" my mother insisted. ""You need to stop this childish behavior. Melissa already hit her and caused a scene here at home. Enough! She's my sister's daughter, which makes her your cousin.""

""I'm sorry, Mom, but she means nothing to me,"" I tried to stay calm. ""She slept with my boyfriend in my bed. That's not something she should do.""

I had been dating Claude for four years; he was my first boyfriend, and I found him in my bed, in my room, sleeping with Kelly, my cousin! I was in shock. Of course, Melissa, my best friend, went after them. Since then, things had been tensed at home because my parents insisted it was silly and that I should act as if nothing had happened and go back to being around my cousin.

""He was wrong, Catherine, since he was your boyfriend,"" my mother argued. ""Kelly, poor thing, was seduced. He dishonored her, now he's marrying her so she won't be talked about badly in town.""

""Oh, Mom! Spare me! The whole town knows Kelly is a shameless woman..."" I lost my patience.

""Catherine, watch your language!"" my father scolded me. ""Look, if you don't want to be around Kelly, fine, but you're going to this wedding. And enough with this rude behavior.""

""I'm what?"" I thought I had heard wrong.

""You're going to your cousin's wedding, Catherine. That's an order! We're your parents, and you'll obey,"" my mother spoke angrily at me as if I were the one in the wrong.

""I'm sorry, Mom, but I won't! I follow your rules, I'm a good daughter, but this time I can't. I was the one who was wronged! I have every right not to want to be the family joke anymore,"" I said, already crying.

""ENOUGH, CATHERINE!"" my father shouted, startling me. ""You're going to this wedding, and that's final.""

""But, Dad...""

""I don't want to hear it, Catherine! It's important to your mother to keep peace in the family. So you're going, period,"" my father said, leaving no room for argument.

I spent the night crying in my room. The next day, I told Melissa everything. She wasted no time and arranged invitations to a masquerade ball, a gala event. She told my parents it would be crucial for my career since the city's most important businesspeople would be there. I could make valuable connections, and our professors had promised to introduce us to various entrepreneurs who could open doors for our professional future.

At first, my parents weren't entirely convinced, but Melissa's parents talked to them and persuaded them that it would be an excellent opportunity for my future. So they agreed that I should take advantage of it.

""Catherine, you can't say no to me! I've already bought the tickets and masks, and I even convinced your parents that this is a super important event for your professional future, which was such hard work. This party is going to be incredible, and you're not going to miss it!"" Melissa looked at me with puppy dog eyes, clasping her hands together as if begging.

I was sitting at my desk at work in the middle of a Thursday afternoon, between taking messages and making calls, when Mel showed up with coffee, chocolate muffins, and this persistence about getting me to agree to go to the masquerade ball, which was the biggest annual event in our city.

""Oh, Mel, how is it that I can never say no to you? Alright, I'll go!""

I agreed to go to the ball, but I still wasn't sure. Either way, I was going to sleep at Mel's house to avoid the wedding, but I wasn't planning on going to the party. However, Melissa kept pushing until she convinced me to go. On Saturday, we got ready at her place.

""Wow, girl! You look absolutely stunning!"" She handed me a beautiful golden mask, intricately designed like lace that covered up to my nose, and I put it on. I was wearing a shimmering red satin dress, and the mask matched perfectly. ""So, are we ready?""

""Yes, we're ready,"" I replied and grabbed my purse. ""Oh, I forgot my perfume.""

""No problem, you can use my mom's new perfume. She won't mind.""

When Fred, Mel's boyfriend, saw us, he smiled, gave Mel a kiss, and said:

""Girls, you look gorgeous! I think you'll leave this party with a new boyfriend, Cat.""

""No boyfriend, Fred. Actually, I think I'd better stay, I'm not in the party mood. Please, Mel, let me stay?""

**Chapter 2**

There was no way out - my friend dragged me to the ball. As soon as we got in, Mel pulled us to the bar and whispered in my ear:

""It's an open bar tonight, so you're going to drink until all that sadness washes away!"" Mel handed me two tequila shots while holding two more in her hands. ""Let's down these!"" We knocked back the tequila, and Fred was already handing each of us a cosmopolitan.

Melissa dragged me to the dance floor, and I was actually having fun. When a slow song started playing, Fred and Mel began slow dancing together. I took that as my cue to head to the buffet, but I didn't make it there. I felt someone grab my hand, and when I turned around, there was a man in a black mask smiling at me - and what a smile! He kissed my hand and pulled me close, whispering in my ear with a husky voice:

""Surely the most beautiful woman in the room won't deny me a dance, will she?""

""And why not? Let's dance,"" I smiled back at him.

It was impossible to resist that seductive husky voice and that gorgeous crooked smile! He was tall with broad shoulders, had a charming smile and blue eyes - so blue they were almost violet. He had sinfully tempting lips, brown hair, and when he pulled me by the waist, I placed my hands on his chest and could feel he was a wall of well-defined muscle. Although the mask concealed his face, he was very charming and enchanting.

""I've been watching you since you arrived,"" this mysterious man whispered in my ear. ""You're so beautiful!""

""You're kind. But you're not from around here, are you?"" He had a powerful presence, radiating authority.

""No. A friend convinced me to come to this party.""

""Looks like we have something in common - my friends convinced me to come too.""

""Lucky me!""

""And why's that?"" I smiled.

""Because I was captivated the moment I saw you. You're stunning."" As he whispered in my ear, I got goosebumps, feeling my face flush and my body tingle - he truly had me enchanted.

""Even with the mask?""

""Even with the mask! You're too beautiful.""

""You're such a charmer.""

""You think I'm charming?""

""You know you are. And handsome too.""

""I'm glad you like what you see.""

""And what do you do for a living, handsome?"" - I felt a bit dizzy, not sure if it was from the drink or the delicious cologne that man was wearing. I ended up stumbling over my own feet.

""Are you okay?""

""I think I need some air.""

""Come with me."" - He pulled me into a dark hallway that led to an emergency exit and started fanning my face. - ""I really want to kiss you. May I?"" - I nodded yes.

He looked into my eyes, held the back of my neck, and our lips met. It started slow but deepened; he pressed me against the wall, and the kiss intensified even more, almost taking our breath away. When he broke the kiss so we could breathe, we looked into each other's eyes - it was like throwing gasoline on fire. He ran his hand down my waist to my leg and pulled my leg up to his waist. I was completely surrendered by then, feeling his body against mine. I went crazy with desire and pulled him closer, wrapping my leg around his waist.

""You're a great kisser!"" - I smiled at him and felt my whole body tingle.

""Oh, beautiful, you're incredible. I want you so badly, here, right now!"" - he said between kisses and slipped his hand under my dress, pulling it up and reaching my underwear. I was on fire when he put his hand inside my underwear and yelled. - ""Oh! So delicious! So hot, so wet!"" - He said and kissed me harder while unzipping his pants. With a quick movement, like someone who had done this before, he tore my underwear and caressed my entrance, as if asking for permission. He looked into my eyes again and asked: ""What do you want me to do?""

""I want you inside me now!"" I responded shamelessly, already panting with desire. I couldn't resist those eyes and that husky voice. I'd never been like this before - normally, I would have pulled away the moment he grabbed my hand, but tonight I had promised myself to have fun and live in the moment if someone interesting came along. And that's exactly what I was doing, living in the moment.

Hearing me, he entered me slowly, watching as I leaned my head against the wall and savored every inch of him - and he was huge. He took the opportunity to scatter kisses along my neck. When he was fully inside, he paused and whispered between kisses in my ear: ""Now I'm going to move."" He pulled out only to thrust back in with full force this time, and it was incredible. I was completely lost and driven wild by his movements as he moved in and out of me frantically.

We lost control and gave ourselves over completely, as if nothing else existed around us. I felt a haze in my eyes as my climax began to build, and I moaned softly in his ear. At that moment, he seemed to go crazy, lifting my other leg to his waist as I wrapped them around him. Kissing me intensely, he thrust even harder into me - it was heaven on earth. I came again, even more intensely than before, leaving me breathless. As I was coming, he whispered that he was close to his limit feeling me pulse around him, and soon I felt his hot release inside me.

We stayed there against that wall, completely breathless, his forehead resting against mine. While kissing me, he slowly withdrew, and I was thoroughly satisfied - as Melissa would say. I smiled and he looked at me, gave me a soft kiss and said:

""You're truly amazing!""

He gently lowered my legs until my feet touched the ground, fixed my dress, adjusted his pants, and hugged me. It was so intimate, so affectionate - despite the wildness of our encounter and the intensity with which we'd given in to each other, he was still gentle with me. I'd never had such an incredible experience, but I'd only ever been with my ex until now. And my ex had never cared about hugging me afterward, or worried about my pleasure - for him, it was just about getting in and out until he was satisfied. So having a man care about me, about my pleasure, take care of me - it was new, and amazingly so. He kissed my neck and whispered in my ear:

""So, beautiful, I still don't know your name."" It took me seconds to process and finally realize that I'd just slept with a complete stranger whose name I didn't even know.

Just as I was about to speak, he pulled his phone from his pocket and asked for a minute to answer it. He stepped away slightly and I could only hear him raising his voice saying:

""What did you say?"" At that moment, the stranger ran off as if he'd forgotten about me, or as if he was just running away from the woman he'd quickly hooked up with at the party.

Of course, Catherine, you're an idiot! But so what? I was just having fun too, and I didn't even know who the guy was, and he didn't know who I was. All good. I pulled myself together, looked in vain for my underwear - no idea where he'd thrown it - and left that hallway.

I went back to the table and found Mel and Fred making out. They soon stopped and focused on me:

""Mel, I think I found the Big Bad Wolf!"" I laughed, and she laughed with me.

""When we get home, I want to know everything!""

""Of course you do!"" I replied with sparkling eyes.

""Prince, I think we can go now. What do you think, Cat?""

""I'm ready whenever you are!"" I said, downing a glass of water.

""Let's go then, girls!"" Fred said and led us to the exit.

We'd barely gotten home when Mel started demanding:

""Tell me everything - who is he, how it went, how it didn't go, everything.""

I laughed and told her everything. When I finished speaking, my friend was staring at me open-mouthed and asked:

""You guys used protection, right?""

My heart started racing! We hadn't used protection. I shook my head no at her; I was in shock realizing how careless I'd been. She immediately tried to calm me down:

""No, Cat, calm down. I'm sure nothing will come of it. But you should get some tests done to make sure everything's okay. I'm going to the kitchen to make us some tea. Don't freak out!""

**Chapter 3**

On Monday during lunch, I met Mel. She handed me a small bag from a fancy store, and I looked at her, confused.

""My mom asked me to give this to you. She said it's perfect for you and doesn't suit her,"" Mel said with a big smile.

I opened the bag, and inside was the perfume I had worn to the ball. A huge smile spread across my face. I loved that perfume, and it was part of the best night of my life. I just hoped that my best night hadn't left me with an STD as a souvenir. With that thought, I thanked Mel and told her I'd call her mom later, then mentioned I wanted to call the lab to schedule some tests.

I called the laboratory and was informed that I needed a doctor's prescription to get the tests covered by health insurance. Thank God the company provided health insurance for employees because otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do. My salary wasn't high, and what little was left after covering college expenses went to helping at home, since my mom didn't work outside the house and my dad didn't make much as a driver.

So I made a doctor's appointment, but the earliest available slot was two weeks away, and I waited anxiously. The more days passed, the more nervous I became, though Mel did everything to calm me down. On the scheduled date, she went to the doctor's with me. With the list of tests in hand, she personally scheduled the lab work and insisted on accompanying me. Three weeks had passed since the party when I finally got the tests done. The results came back five days later, and I returned to the doctor. Of course, Mel was with me.

The doctor checked the results and looked me in the eyes:

""Miss Catherine, your health is excellent. You're healthy. But from now on, you'll need to take better care of yourself.""

I breathed a sigh of relief, but was I really about to get lectured by the doctor for having unprotected bedlife with a stranger? Well, I deserved it - not using protection was silly, I could have caught a disease. And then he continued:

""Congratulations, you're conceived! I'm going to refer you to an OB-GYN for prenatal care...""

I didn't hear anything else, just the blood pulsing in my ears. I couldn't believe this! conceived? How would I explain this? It's not possible. Me, of all people, the perfect goody-two-shoes who never stepped out of line, who always considered the consequences before doing anything, who was always responsible - the first time I let rationality slide, I ended up conceived and didn't even know who the father was! Mel held my hand and kept repeating:

""Calm down, Cat, everything will be okay!""

How could everything be okay? I didn't even know who the father was. I would have to tell my parents, their only daughter would break their hearts. They would be disappointed, hate me, and kick me out of the house. How could I explain that I don't even know what the father of my child looks like? I was already hyperventilating. Suddenly, I felt the doctor taking my hand and speaking calmly:

""Easy now, dear! The situation, from what I can see, isn't ideal, but you can't get this nervous, it will harm your baby. Now you have to take care of yourself for the baby's sake. I'm sure the people who love you will support and help you. But you need to calm down because only you can ensure this baby develops healthily and is born strong. Do you understand me?""

I looked at that short, white-haired, slightly chubby gentleman, with his glasses perched on the tip of his nose, and nodded positively. Somehow he calmed me down a bit, maybe because his eyes sparkled with a kindness and understanding that we rarely see these days. The doctor asked his secretary to bring me some chamomile tea, and while I drank it and tried to calm down, he gave all the information to Melissa, who listened attentively.

We left the office and Melissa took me to a diner, saying we needed to eat something. As soon as I sat down, I felt the tears falling. My friend hugged me and told me once again that I wasn't alone. I looked at her and said:

""The only thing I'm sure of right now is that I want you and Fred to be my child's godparents because I know you'll support them and give them lots of love.""

Her eyes sparkled, and she burst into tears, responding between sobs:

""I'll be the best godmother in the world and I'll always be close to our baby! And I'm sure Fred will be very happy too!""

She assured me she would always be by my side, made it clear that I wouldn't go through anything alone, and that she would be with me when I talked to my parents. My parents... oh! I started thinking and decided I wouldn't hide it from them for even a day; I would tell them that very night. I wouldn't go to college, I would go home to talk to them. Mel immediately supported me and said:

""Let's go then, I'm with you!""

When we arrived at my house, my parents were startled, and my mom came right over, worried:

""Girls, didn't you go to class today? Is everything okay?""

""Not really, Mom. I need to talk to you both.""

My parents immediately realized it was something very serious. We all sat in the living room and I told them what was happening, admitting I had been irresponsible by hooking up with a stranger at the party. I obviously didn't go into details, but I made it clear that I couldn't find my child's father again. The disappointment in their eyes was evident. My mother was sobbing uncontrollably, saying I was ruined. My father hadn't said anything yet. Seeing how upset my mother was, Melissa quickly went to the kitchen and came back with a glass of sugar water for her. Melissa always gives sugar water to nervous people, saying it calms them down - I never understood that.

Finally, my father spoke:

""You made a huge mistake and there's no going back.""

My parents were very simple people. My father was a tall, strong man, and my mother was an older version of me, but both had great character and solid principles they always made sure to pass on to me. Hearing my father emphasize that I had messed up made my heart ache even more. I started crying and said:

""I know, Dad, I was irresponsible. But there's nothing I can do now. I'll drop out of college to raise my child. And I'm going to pack my bags...""

""Pack your bags? You're very mistaken if you think you're leaving this house like that. You made a mistake, and you disappointed us, but we love you, we'll get through this and we'll help you. You're not alone, my daughter! And neither is this child!"" My father said this and my heart filled with hope.

""But Dad, I brought shame to you...""

""You're not the first and won't be the last single mother in this world. We would have liked things to be different for you, not so difficult. You've always been so responsible! But if this is how it is, we'll face it together. You won't leave college - more than ever, you need to grow in life to take care of your child. You're going to be a single mother, your responsibility is huge. We'll help you, and even though it will be difficult, everything will work out.""

Melissa was already crying and quickly spoke to my parents:

""Mr. Anthony, Mrs. Selina, you can count on me, I'll help with everything! Besides, I'm this baby's godmother, Cat is like a sister to me, and I'll always be around.""

My parents looked at her gratefully. I looked at those three feeling completely blessed to have them in my life, full of love for them and experiencing a totally new feeling for that little being still growing inside me, whose existence I had just discovered!

As difficult as being a single mother would be, that night at the ball was the best night of my life. I could never forget those violet-blue eyes looking at me with adoration during our furtive encounter and everything my body experienced that night. I would always have that sweet memory with me.

The following months were difficult. I kept the dress, shoes, mask, and perfume that Mel's mother gave me in a box. On difficult days, I would open that box and relive that night in my memory.

Although I had a peaceful pregnancy, people's comments and cruelty were hard to bear. To make matters worse, after they got married, my ex and my cousin moved in with her parents, who lived on the same street as us. They made sure to humiliate me with nasty comments whenever they saw me and spread throughout the neighborhood that I didn't know who my child's father was and that I was a loose woman, which was why Claude had left me. I wanted to end them! Kelly's mother, who was my mother's sister, never missed a chance to come to our house and torment us, saying how fortunate it was that her daughter wasn't like me, that she was a good girl who had married a decent man. She seemed to have forgotten that she had stolen my boyfriend and slept with him in my bed.

But I swallowed it all; it wasn't worth arguing with these people, and I didn't want to transmit negative feelings to my child. As the days went by, I loved that baby more and more. I had no idea such love could exist. Everything I did, I did for him. I would protect him from everything; I would give my life to him. And surprisingly, during the whole time of carrying with a baby, everything seemed to flow in my favor, things were falling into place and working out.

My boss was great, understood my situation, and even gave me a small raise, which was a huge help! Mel and Fred showered me with attention, they were in love with their godchild even before knowing if it would be a girl or boy. They insisted on buying everything for the nursery, which turned out beautiful. Mel accompanied me to all appointments and every test, never missing anything. She even organized two baby showers - one at the company and another at college. My child would come into the world surrounded by love.

I found out I was having a boy and decided to name him Peter. And so it was. Peter was born healthy, with a pair of huge violet-blue eyes that would never let me forget the night that changed my life, but was also the best night I'd ever had! I would never forget that man!

My son was surrounded by love from the first moment. My parents were enchanted by their grandson. Mel and Fred came to our house every day to see their godson and check how we were doing. Mel was always there supporting me in everything. Her parents also came to visit Peter and said they would be honorary grandparents since they considered me their daughter too, which I found beautiful. They also surrounded me with care. They insisted on giving the stroller as a gift, and the day Peter was born, they came to the maternity ward with a huge basket of flowers and welcome balloons.

After my maternity leave ended, my son stayed in my mother's care while I was at work and college. I worked hard and devoted all my time not spent at college or work to my son. With the help of my parents and my son's godparents, I managed everything and didn't miss any semester in college, graduating alongside my friend Melissa. It was a great moment for me and my family. With my diploma in hand, I would now pursue a better future, with the firm purpose that my son would never lack anything.",1,1747157592.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1- Zhao Yun is a heavy ass sleeper. so much so that a simple nudge or poke won't work sometimes and would need Zhang Fei to scream at him to wake him up. and despite his even temperament, he can get really cranky if he doesn't get enough rest. and in rare cases, would even resort to physical violence if provoked hard enough. a sleep deprived Zhao Yun is a dangerous Zhao Yun!

2- in an anachronistic setting where tech is introduced, he'd be into horror and action movies/videogames/anime and rock/metal music. he's immune to jumpscares. he's no tech savvy but he's better at technology than most folk from his era. he's also a good driver :D

3- in a crossover setting, he has a circle of friends from different worlds. he's known to be the only one in the three kingdoms who can take down monsters from Monster Hunter and has an Estrellian monstie partner (my boy is that special to me! sue me!) and is friends with my MH character.

[we interrupt this post for a quick peek at his sexiness. ok moving on.](https://preview.redd.it/nk5lc3jcxk0f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8a8176d0bc761ea2dc8357377c69835faa8f6ea)

4- we all know he's such a goodie goodie. but even he can get dirty minded lol and isn't above resorting to foul language especially when he's super mad. but he doesn't dare curse when Liu Bei is around out of deep respect for his lord, unless he's SUPER pissed which is quite rare considering his calm nature.

5- he loves his homeboy and lover Yukimura. Yukimura is also involved with the crossover and monster hunting business but that's a different story.

[wait a second \*licks his cheek\* ok proceed ](https://preview.redd.it/rr9cjibbyk0f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f046777607ffeccc3c172653469164dcca482149)

6- he's a smooth dancer and talented erhu player. his dancing scenes in Empires were hot af

7- i know i'm probably going too far with the favoritism but Ma Chao is jealous of Zhao Yun. sorry, Ma Chao fans \^\^""

8- this one is a bit juvenile and OOC (who tf cares!) he gets involved in burping contests with the homies but doesn't dare let Liu Bei hear his burping hehe my boy has a playful side and likes to fool around with his buddies :D

[perfect material for shampoo, skin lotion and lip palm commercial](https://preview.redd.it/5uqp6u1hwk0f1.jpg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2442bf2fc892671e46e8988a7bbfa78cee01ea6)

9- he has a soft spot for animals. considering the kind of guy he is, it's hard to imagine otherwise.

10 - this one is quite intimate and on a serious tone. but when it comes to sexual activity, he prefers to do it sparingly. not out of dislike, but he doesn't believe in 'sex everyday'. he and Yukimura believe that the longer you wait, the better it feels. and the more you repeat a certain activity nonstop no matter how fun, it can lose its spark with time. so he and Yukimura start boning only on occasion when they REALLY crave it.

11- he loves taking his baths and sometimes takes up to 30 mins soaking in a bathtub. speaking of which:

[currently speaking to you all from the ICU in a critical condition due to nosebleeding for two hours.](https://preview.redd.it/zznnrekg2l0f1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05825010be15bd88b0d87d80793fe6c016151ed5)

12- he loves his spear (the one he uses to fight people not the one between his legs) but he occasionally uses the sword and is just as deadly with it. saw a YouTube video abut him using a sword in DW9 and i was like 'my dude! use this shit more often!'

13- he has a nice sense of humour. normally he'd be all about justice and peace and junk but i like t think he can crack a good joke. even being outright sarcastic like 'ah gee! you think!'

15- we all know him as the best babysitter. i like to think he has a way with babies and even helped bring up Liu Shan. even teasing him with the usual phrase: I used to change your diapers!

16- ehhh i don't know. haven't gone that far ahead lol might add more.

**Tam**

Tyla said something, I don’t even remember it. This is too much, way too much.

The medics are lifting Jhem now, placing him on a hover stretcher. His ears twitch faintly he’s coming back around, stars be thanked. But my heart’s still thundering. My focus keeps snapping back to the predator, waiting for it to *move*. To lunge. To show its true face behind that mask.

It doesn’t. It just stands there calmly. Like it’s used to this.

And then stars above it *speaks*.

“I’m very sorry for the alarm, sir” the human says. “This is all a misunderstanding.”

I flinch. Hard.

Its voice is deep. Too deep. A low, rumbling sound, rough like gravel under paw. I swear I hear a *snarl* woven into every word, even if its tone is gentle. Every syllable grates against something primal inside me, some ancient instinct that screams *run*.

“I’m not… going home with her,” it continues, slow and deliberate. “I came with Tyla to Venlil Prime because I have some acquaintances at the human shelters. I’ll be out of your… ah, wool, very soon.”

Fur? Did it say *fur*?

No, it said *wool*. It *corrected* itself.

Jyla stiffens beside me, her claws digging into her datapad case. She doesn’t say a word, just stares at the creature. At the mask.

I don’t respond. I can’t. My throat’s gone dry, my tail a rigid line behind me. The human’s voice is still hanging in the air. So polite, so carefully measured, but all I hear is the *predator* underneath. The control. The… *performance*.

And yet, a small part of me,  the cursed logical part, the voice I usually listen to, whispers that it hasn’t made a move. That it’s being respectful. That maybe it means what it says.

But predators lie. That’s what they *do*.

I narrow my eyes at the mask. I *know* it’s watching me. Judging. Maybe *laughing* beneath that mirrored shell. Tyla glances between us, her ears tilted back just slightly. Her voice is soft now, but I can hear the edge in it. 

“Val’s just here for a short time, okay? He’s not staying with us. He’s not even coming to the house.”

I look at her. Then back at him. The human, *Valentín*, she had said, hasn’t moved. His hands are still at his sides. No teeth. No growl. Just that deep, unnatural voice lingering in the air like smoke.

“I don’t want to intrude, sir,” he says again, quieter now. “I just want to see some people I know. That’s all.”

People. *People*.

He means *other predators*.

I’ve never met one of them before, I avoided them like the plague they are. Never spoken to one. Never *heard* one talk like this. I thought they’d snarl, bark, leer. But this one… he’s calm and controlled. It makes my wool itch.

It makes me think *he’s trained for this*.

“Tam,” Jyla murmurs, “what if… he’s telling the truth?”

I just stare at the mask, and I wonder what it’s hiding, a fearsome snarl, or a cold scowl.

Tyla steps forward.

She doesn’t look at me right away. Her ears are still half-pinned, her posture uncertain. Not the battle-ready soldier I saw striding through the terminal \[minutes\] ago, but something smaller. More vulnerable.

“Val’s telling the truth,” she says. Her voice is level, but I know her tones. I know my daughter. And I hear the crack just beneath the surface.

“He’s here for a few days. For the shelters. That’s all. He’s not staying with us.”

She finally looks at me, and I see it.

Something behind her eyes. Not fear or shame either. It’s… pain. Just for a second. A flicker of hurt that passes as fast as it came, like she’s choking something back.

And that’s when it hits me. This is a *lie*.

Not the human’s lie. *Hers*.

She’s lying to me.

I glance between them. The predator standing still, unreadable, like some monstrous statue. And Tyla, trying to pretend everything is fine.

“Alright,” she says, too quickly. “I’ll be heading home soon. I didn’t mean for it to turn into… this.”

She gestures faintly toward the medics, the security, the terminal still rippling with murmurs. The scene she’s *caused* by walking in with *him*.

My chest tightens. Something feels *wrong*. Deeply wrong.

If it was just the predator… I could hate it. I could shout. I could demand it leave and take its taint with it.

But Tyla’s voice…

That small hitch in her breath…

The look in her eyes that reminds me of when she broke her leg falling off the canyon ledge as a pup, and tried to pretend it didn’t hurt…

She’s *protecting* it.

Or maybe she thinks she’s protecting *me*.

Tyla exhales slowly, then steps forward and wraps her arms around Jyla first. My mate is stiff at first, but she returns the hug with a slow, uncertain squeeze. Then Tyla turns to me.

I don’t move, but she pulls me in anyway.

Her wool is warm. The texture familiar. She feels… bigger than I remember. Or maybe I just feel older.

“I’m gonna take Val to the shelter district,” she murmurs. “Make sure he doesn’t run into trouble with the exterminators on the way.”

I pull back at that, ears flicking. “Maybe he *should*,” I say, before I can stop myself. “Wouldn’t be the worst outcome.”

Tyla winces, but not in surprise. No, she *knew* I’d say that. Probably prepared for worse.

Still, she weakly flicks her tail, like she’s trying to understand me even when I make it impossible.

“Try not to get blood on the carpet fantasizing about it, Dad.”

She’s joking, but it cuts.

Stars. She always was stubborn.

I sigh. There’s no winning here. Not with her.

“Just… get home safe, alright? and *please* let me know when Jhem wakes up”

Jyla nods, her voice quieter than mine but no less sharp. “You better know what you’re doing, Tyla.”

“I do,” she says. 

She reaches down and gently strokes Jhem’s ear. He stirs, blinking up at her with dazed confusion, and Tyla gives him a little squeeze on the paw. Then she rises and turns, walking back toward the human. Back toward the damn *thing*.

It follows her as she leads him out of the terminal, silent and looming like a walking shadow. She doesn’t even flinch. Just before they disappear into the crowd, Tyla glances over her shoulder and raises a paw.

“I love you,” she calls.

“I love you too,” I mutter.

Jyla echoes it stronger than I expected, and we watch our daughter vanish into the mess she’s chosen. **She was touching** ***that thing*****.**

I look down at Jhem, who’s groaning softly, so shaken about all of this.

What the hell did these monsters do to our girl out there in the stars?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Tyla**

The buzz of the comm finally goes quiet as I lower my pad. Val’s still standing beside me, silent as ever.

“She said a car's on the way,” I mutter. “Fifteen \[minutes\], maybe less.”

The human on the other end, a woman with a strange accent and an overworked tone, hadn’t even bothered hiding her frustration.

“We can’t just deploy resources for every bump in the road,” she’d said. “Darkriver’s got limited coverage, and we’ve got three resettlements happening today. If this is about ‘stares’ at the terminal-”

“We had a medical emergency,” I’d said firmly. ”My friend is military, and so am I. Just got back. We’re not asking for a limo, just a safe drop at your sector.”

That changed the tone. A short pause, then a sigh.

“Alright. One car, nothing fancy. No more surprises, please.”

Now I’m here, shifting my paws awkwardly beside Val. The noise of the terminal is behind us. Ahead, just silence. And waiting.

I feel like I can’t breathe right.

I  thanked her and cut the line.

Now we’re standing near the outer edge of the terminal district, in a quiet pocket of shadow between buildings, the crowd behind us like a dull roar. I cross my arms, tail twitching.

I don’t speak right away. I *can’t*.

The image of my father’s face, his *eyes* won’t leave me. That raw, coiled panic. The way his voice cracked when he saw Val. The way Jhem collapsed. The silence in my mother’s voice. The *hurt* buried underneath.

Stars, what a mess.

I glance at Val. He’s still watching the road. Mask on, unreadable. His posture is neutral, but I know him well enough now to recognize the subtle tension in his shoulders, the way his fingers curl slightly at his sides.

I fidget and shuffle my paws. My claws scratch at the edge of my belt, and I feel my throat tighten.

Finally, I say it, almost too soft for even him to hear:

“Thank you. For what you said… back there.”

Val turns his head, slowly. Doesn’t interrupt.

I keep my eyes fixed on the pavement.

“I mean, you didn’t have to. I know you wanted to be honest, and I kind of threw you under the shuttle. I just… I panicked. I thought if they knew you were staying with *me*, they’d”

My voice cracks. I shut up fast. I clench my jaw and blink hard, willing the heat behind my eyes to go away.

“I’m sorry,” I mutter. “You didn’t deserve that.”

A  hand reaches up, slow and gentle, and rests lightly between my ears. His touch is careful, like he’s afraid I’ll flinch- but I don’t. I lean into it, really *lean* into it.

The tension that’s been coiled in my spine since we stepped off the shuttle begins to slip away. His fingers stroke softly down the side of my head, ruffling the wool behind my ear in that way I never knew I liked until I met him.

I close my eyes, just for a moment, and press my head into his torso like some lovesick prey creature. My tail gives a flick… embarrassed, maybe, but I don’t care right now.

Then I wrap my arms around him and hug him tightly, my snout pressing against the hard fabric of his jacket.

“I can’t wait to see you again,” I murmur, voice muffled. “Promise me you won’t vanish.”

He squeezes back. Not hard, just enough to let me know he’s here.

—----------------

**Jyla** 

The tea's gone cold in my paws.

I haven’t taken a sip since we sat down.

Across from me, Tam is pacing again. Back and forth, across the living room floor, his tail lashing every few steps like it’s got a mind of its own. Jhem’s curled up on the couch beside me with a blanket and a cold pack, groggy but breathing fine now. He hasn’t said a word since we got home.

None of us have, really.

Until Tam mutters, “What *was* that thing?”

“Tam, you know what a human is.”

“Yes, but did you see it? Stars, Jyla *look* at me! Did you see the *size* of it!? I don’t think that’s normal even for those monsters”

I do look at him. Slowly. Calmly. He’s trembling again. Ears twitching like there’s a predator still in the house. I hate it when he gets like this, not because I think he’s wrong, but because I know how deep it goes for him.

“It looked like something out of a nightmare,” I say, finally. “All… muscles and silence. Like it’s waiting to snap.”

Tam makes a strangled sound, half agreement, half disgust. “And the *mask*. As if hiding its eyes somehow makes it *less* terrifying.”

Tam’s pacing slows. He stops by the window, stares out into the streets. His tail flicks once… then again. Then he says, quietly:

“They were *too* close.”

I glance up at him, already tense.

“What do you mean?”

He doesn’t look at me.

“I mean… the way she looked at it. Stood beside it. The way it touched her  like she was *used* to it. Like she *liked* it.”

I stiffen. My wool bristles.

Tam’s voice drops lower, almost a growl. “Jyla, do you think they’ve-” He hesitates, then finishes with a whisper. “Do you think they’ve *mated*?”

The room goes still.

My ears snap back so fast it hurts.

“Tam!” I hiss, rising halfway out of my seat. “What in the *world* is wrong with you?!”

He flinches at my voice… good. I *never* raise it unless I mean it.

“I will not have that kind of filth spoken in this house,” I snap. “That is our *daughter* you’re talking about.”

“I *know*,” he says defensively. “But you saw.”

“No!” I cut him off. “I saw a confused, misguided girl trying her best to make something awful look normal. That’s not *mating*, Tam. That’s her trying to survive whatever they put her through. You think she wanted this?”

His mouth opens. Closes.

I sit back down, arms folded tight across my chest, pulse pounding.

“She’s still our girl,” I say, quieter now. “She’s not stupid. She’s most likely  not…tainted, maybe?*.* She’s just lost.”

Tam finally turns from the window. His expression is uncertain but quieter now. Like I’d slapped him with the words alone.

“Right,” he mutters, rubbing his face. “Right. Sorry.”

The silence between us this time is thicker. Not peaceful. Just tired.

\--

The door chimed softly.

Tam and I both turned at once, ears perked. Jhem stirred beneath his blanket, blinking blearily as the front door slid open.

And there she was.

Tyla stepped into the house, silhouetted in the amber twilight, her posture slouched with fatigue but still somehow unbowed. The light caught in her fur, and for a moment, just a flicker, I saw her as she’d been as a pup. That same stubborn flick to her ears. That same fire in her stance, even after whatever hell she'd been through.

She barely got a word out before Tam pulled her into a tight hug. I rose from the couch and joined him, and Jhem too, drowsy but eager, wrapped his arms around her waist from the side.

Tyla held us all like she meant it.

“I’m home,” she whispered.

“You’d better be,” Tam muttered against her shoulder, his voice rough. “You gave us all a scare.”

We eased apart eventually, guiding her inside. I tried not to fuss, but I couldn’t stop scanning her looking for injuries, fatigue, anything that seemed *off*. Her wool was a little thinner in places. Her posture was heavier. But she was *alive*, and she was home.

We all sat together in the living room. Tam brought out the tea again, reheated, and this time Tyla actually took a cup. Her hands curled around the mug like it was the only warmth left in the world.

We tried small talk.

“How long was the voyage?”

“Boring. Long. The human ships are weird, if you were wondering.”

That got a chuckle out of Jhem. I didn’t miss the way Tyla ruffled his ears afterward.

“And service?” I asked gently, trying to sound casual.

Tyla sipped her tea. Her eyes flicked toward the window. “Busy.”

Tam raised an eyebrow. “Just *busy*?”

She gave a small laugh, one that didn’t reach her eyes.

“There was this one time. We got jumped by a rogue Arxur scouting group, a weird, desperate pack, trying to attack a Colony planet. It was too much for our old ship.”

Tam’s ears flattened. Jhem froze mid-sip.

Tyla just shrugged. “We evacuated. Lost half the crew...we rushed to the escape pods”

Her eyes glanced down. That flicker again.

I saw something else behind them. Something she wasn’t saying.

Not fear but weight. The kind of weight people carry when they’ve *seen* too much. I didn’t ask what happened inside that pod. Not because I didn’t want to know, but because I could tell she didn’t want me to carry it. She was protecting us. Just like *he* used to.

My father… She looked like him just then.

Not her face, not really. But that *look*. That hardened calm. That fierce independence. The way she spoke so casually of things that would break most civilians. She was his blood, through and through.

He’d worn the same expression when he came home from service. Always told me, “There’s nothing in those stories a pup needs to hear.”

And here was my daughter, saying the same, without even using the words.

A lump formed in my throat. I blinked quickly and looked down at my tea, willing it to go away.

—-

Dinner was quiet, but in a comforting way.

I’d reheated the sweetroot soup and set out the strayu I’d bought earlier that day. Before the terminal, before the fainting, before the *monster*. It all felt like a lifetime ago.

The kitchen’s old lights buzzed softly overhead, and for the first time in what felt like *ages*, we all sat together like a family again.

Tyla tore a piece of strayu with practiced ease, dunking it in the thick pink soup and chewing slowly. “Stars, I missed this,” she said around a bite. “Everything on the ships either comes in a pouch, frozen or tastes like sterilizer.”

Jhem practically inhaled his portion, crumbs dusting his wool like stardust. His little tail wagged against the chair leg with every bite.

Tyla smiled and leaned her chin on one paw. “So, Jhem,” she said, voice light, “how’s school? Still the smartest pup in your class?”

Jhem perked up immediately. “I’m *way* ahead in number-puzzles now! Teacher says I’m a logic star. I even finished the advanced fun-book before anyone else!”

Tyla laughed, full and warm. “That’s my little brother.”

He puffed up with pride, and I could feel my own heart swell just watching them. Tam grumbled something approving between mouthfuls, but I hardly heard him. My eyes were on Jhem.

He was *so proud*. So full of light. So *young*.

I hoped he stayed that way. That he’d chase knowledge, not war. That he’d *build* things, not break them. That he’d never have to hold a weapon, never stare down a predator, never *hide* what he’d seen like Tyla did.

I looked at my daughter again, so strong and weathered and brave… and silently begged the stars not to ask the same of her little brother.

“Good,” I said softly, setting a paw on Jhem’s shoulder. “Keep it up. Maybe you’ll be a scientist someday. Or a writer.”

“Or a *pilot!*” he said brightly, tail wagging harder.

I gave a small sigh. “Maybe.”

—-----------

**Valentín**

The shelter smelled weird. Like fresh metal and dried herbs and that faint floral scent that clung to everything on Venlil Prime. The air recyclers hummed in the ceiling, soft as a lullaby. Orange light leaked in through the thin windows, painting the walls gold.

I dropped my duffel at the base of the cot. Standard-issue frame. Thin mattress. One pillow. Quiet.

I could work with this.

“*Well I’ll be dipped in jet fuel and rolled through a cactus patch,*” came a familiar voice, twangy and booming down the hall. “If it ain’t Val damn Osorio. Still breathin’ and lookin’ like you crawled outta a trench.”

I turned, eyebrows already raising, *no way*.

There he was. Washburn. Red hair, red beard and red-faced, and about as subtle as an orbital strike. Big as ever, one leg dragging a bit, held together by metal parts. Same cowboy swagger, same awful grin.

“Wash,” I said, letting my shoulders drop just a bit. “You still alive?”

“Hell yeah, and ain’t that a miracle?” he said, crossing the room with a lopsided limp and yanking me into a back-thumping hug. “Lookit you! Still got all yer parts. You even uglier than I remember.”

“You’re louder.”

“Y’damn right I am.” He stepped back, raking his eyes over me. “So whatcha doin’ in this flyspeck of a town? They drop you here on accident or somethin’?”

I paused. A little too long.

“*Escobar*,” he said, suddenly grinning like a devil. “You ain’t *moved in*, have ya?”

*Asshole.*

“Don’t call me that.”

Washburn held up both hands, laughing. “Hey hey, no offense hombre. You know I only use it ‘cause it gets that look on your face.”

“And one of these days, I’ll put a boot in yours.”

“Wouldn’t be the first time.”

I exhaled through my nose and sat on the edge of the cot. He limped over and leaned on the doorframe.

“So seriously, what brings you back? This place ain't exactly a tourist trap.”

“Came with someone,” I said.

“Uh-huuuh.”

“Not staying long. Just making sure things are square.”

Wash’s eyebrow twitched upward. “A *someone* with soft wool, cute ears and a tail, maybe?”

I didn’t answer. He chuckled low in his throat, but to his credit, didn’t push.

“Well, good news is, the shelter’s still standin’, and the lounge’s got a table that ain’t collapsed yet. I got cards, a busted speaker, and a thermos of somethin’ that vaguely resembles coffee. C’mon, Esc- *Val*. Sit a spell.”

I shook my head, half-smiling despite myself.

“Lead the way.”

We took over the lounge table. It was battered and dented in all the right places. Washburn poured two cups of whatever he’d convinced the people here to call coffee. It tasted like burnt engine oil mixed with tree bark, but it was hot, and it worked.

Cards hit the table with a practiced slap. Wash shuffled like a magician, one-handed and grinning the whole time.

“Alright, partner,” he said. “We’re playin’ blackjack. Loser drinks. Winner... also drinks.”

“Real high-stakes operation you got here.”

He shot me a wink. “Gotta make your own fun out in these alien pastures.”

The first few rounds went fine. I wasn’t exactly winning, but I was keeping up  until my pad buzzed.

I checked it, casually. One message. *Tyla.*

My fingers drummed the edge of the pad as I read it twice, like the meaning might change if I stared long enough.

Washburn watched me with that slow-building grin.

**“Awwww hell”** he drawled. “*That’s* what this is. You’re distracted.”

“Shut up.”

“You got the puppy eyes! Or I guess... predator eyes? Hah!”

I shoved the pad face down. “Play your damn cards.”

He did. And he cleaned the floor with me.

“You just hit on seventeen, you dolt,” he cackled. “You tryin’ to *lose*?”

“Just jet lag.”

“Oh sure. Let me guess, lil’ fluffy girlfriend got you all flustered.”

“She’s not my girlfriend,” I muttered, ears burning. “We’re just…  We’re friends. Squadmates.”

“Right, right, ***so there IS a she***” he said, dragging the word out like warm molasses. “Just squadmates. She’s probably just textin’ you about, I dunno, *tactical retreat patterns*, huh?”

“Strategic orbital defense positioning, you know” I deadpanned.

He slapped the table and laughed so hard he nearly spilled his drink.

“Oh *damn*, Val! You got it *bad*! Next thing I know you’ll be crochetin’ her a sweater outta your bootlaces.”

“I’m gonna beat you with this deck.”

“Uh-huh. Right after you write her a poem about the moons and how her tail’s all fluffy in the dusklight.”

“I *swear* to God.”

He grinned ear to ear, barely breathing between chuckles. “Man, this is better than any soap opera I ever streamed. You’re swoonin’!”

“I am *not* swooning,” I snapped, but it came out more like a whine. “I’m- I’m maintaining communications with a teammate.”

“Yeah, and I’m maintainin’ this straight face, bud!” he snorted, barely holding it together.

I sighed and threw my cards in. “New game.”

“Whatever you say, *Latin Lover*.”

Despite everything, I found myself smiling.

I hadn’t laughed like this in weeks. Maybe months.

Wash poured us both another cup of whatever that sludge was, and we kept playing and trash-talking like idiots for hours.

1klrwz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimeDiscussion/comments/1klrwz5/rita_pangalangan_her_13_year_old_disabled/,Rita Pangalangan: her 13 year old disabled daughter died in a hot car after being left on the floorboard for 6 hours. Rita and her boyfriend were nearby the entire time. what happened?,"Rita Pangalangan was charged with murder for the death of her daughter, Cristina Pangalangan. Cristina had developmental disabilities that rendered her nonverbal, along with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. Rita was her fulltime caregiver. 

The day Cristina died, she had been transported into a car by Rita’s boyfriend, Larry King, around 11 AM. The couple had a camera pointed at their porch and driveway, and supposedly Larry had been carrying Cristina before unceremoniously dumping her into the car in such a way that she landed on the floor face down, presumably because he and Rita were in the middle of an argument. He then shut the door, with the key fob still inside with a dead battery. The couple immediately realized they were locked out with Cristina inside alone. For 6 hours these two can be seen haphazardly trying to pry the doors and windows open, going in and out of the house, and even swinging on the porch swing before they decided to head out to get a new battery around 4 pm. It is believed by this point, Cristina was already dead. 

The little girl was found with heat blisters and had vomited on herself. It is unknown if she could be heard from outside the vehicle. Rita Pangalangan and Larry King had tests run on their blood and the presence of methamphetamines was found. Rita denied drug use while Larry admitted she had had some with her coffee that day.

So what happened exactly? Was this a planned murder? Was it negligence brought on by drug use, or fatigue? Or something in between?

Based on the circumstances, the drugs, the fact that there was a tv on them the entire time that they were aware of, I believe that the couple always planned to leave Cristina in the car for a few hours, to create a scenario where they are deemed unfit parents, so that Cristina could then be given to someone else. There were already signs that they had mentally checked out of being caregivers, like that they weren’t properly feeding Cristina or that they’d just leave her alone in her room for hours without stimulation. To escape the scrutiny of giving up their child, it made more sense in their meth minds to orchestrate a near-death of Cristina that would then be caught on camera. I don’t think they ever planned to kill her, because why go through all this effort just to go to prison? The alternative is of course mental illness/drug abuse and it being as simple as that, but this case is so tragic and strange I find myself searching for more answers.

Commodore Ssellies stared at the datapad as if it had personally insulted her.

It hadn’t, of course. It had simply done what datapads did—delivered information, usually unwelcome, often ridiculous. This particular message bore the insignia of Fleet Oversight Command and the faint stink of panic masked as initiative. It contained two things she hated: direct orders, and subtlety. The actual content was short.

“In response to recent field reports regarding Human Auxiliary Unit 12 (Calliope’s Curse), assign one liaison officer to long-term embedment. Observation, integration, and behavioral documentation required. Submit monthly reports. Avoid disruption.”

Avoid disruption, Ssellies thought, bitterly amused. Yes, let’s embed a Fleet officer with the flying psychological hazard that is Calliope’s Curse, and then just not disrupt anything. Perfect plan. Next, maybe we’ll invite a sun to dinner and ask it to kindly not burn anything.

The worst part wasn’t the order. The worst part was knowing she couldn’t ignore it. Not when Veltrik’s now-infamous report had gone system-wide.

Ssellies remembered the report. Everyone did. The damn thing had become a kind of legend. Veltrik, a compliance officer whose idea of wild abandon was labeling a wrench rack without color-coding, had boarded Calliope’s Curse for a standard inspection. He had returned three days later covered in ash, chewing silence, and clutching a datapad that contained only two lines.

“Ship is not in compliance with any known safety regulations.”
“Recommend immediate promotion to rapid-response deterrent squadron.”

Attached was a short video. A grainy compilation of things that, by any reasonable standard, should not have worked. Railguns welded to the hull. Power rerouted through nonstandard junctions. Crew members casually bypassing core fail-safes while drinking out of mugs labeled “Definitely Not Coolant.” And yet… the ship operated. Successfully. With a confirmed combat record that now rivaled small fleet detachments.

High Command didn’t know whether to court the humans or quarantine them. So, they decided to observe. From a safe distance. Using someone disposable.

Ssellies tapped the desk once, thinking. She had just the candidate.

She didn’t even finish reading his most recent message. The moment she saw the sender—3rd Sub-Lieutenant Syk’lis—she sent his file with the recommendation note:

“Exemplary attention to detail. Naturally curious. Will ask questions no one wants to answer.”

Then, in her private log, she wrote:

“If they don’t kill him, they’ll at least shut him up.”

Syk’lis was elated.

He read the transfer order three times, checking for errors. There were none. Assigned to Human Auxiliary Division 12. Long-term embedment. Behavioral analysis. Direct field access. It was, by all appearances, a significant step forward in his career.

Of course, he’d earned it. His departmental compliance record was flawless. His internal audits had only been overturned twice, and one of those had involved a misinterpreted comma in a footnote.

He began packing immediately: one standard-issue uniform set, one backup set in climate-neutral weave, six annotated volumes of the Galactic Fleet Regulation Codex (ed. 473-C), his primary datapad, a backup pad, a backup-backup pad, and a sealed archive of lecture recordings titled “Compliance as Construct: The Linguistics of Order.”

He also included a gift for the human crew: a small framed copy of Fleet Directive 19.3, which covered onboard safety signage standards. He imagined they’d never seen it before.

As for Calliope’s Curse, he’d read the summary from Veltrik’s file but had assumed, reasonably, that much of it was either exaggerated or already corrected. After all, the Fleet would never allow a ship like that to continue operations unless it had been... resolved.

He set his departure notice, submitted his pre-observation framework outline, and titled his project:
“Non-Linear Command Behavior in Species-Class Affiliates: A Human Case Study.”

Calliope’s Curse received the notice via shortwave burst.

Captain Juno read the message aloud to the bridge crew.

“A Galactic Confederation liaison will be joining you for observational embedment. This is a cooperative assignment. Treat the officer with respect.”

He folded the message and used it to level a cup on the console. “So. They’re sending a handler.”

Willis, half inside a vent panel with a spanner in one hand and a stick of dried rations in the other, muttered, “Do we warn him?”

“No,” Juno said. “Let him meet the ship.”

They made no changes. They ran no briefings. They didn’t hide the maintenance logs or rewire the systems to appear standard. That would’ve been dishonest.

They simply let the Curse remain exactly as it was: loud, unpredictable, and still somehow terrifyingly efficient.

Syk’lis stepped off the transport at Forward Platform Gator and immediately began documenting inconsistencies.

The station appeared to have survived recent structural trauma. Hull panels were scorched, weld lines open to vacuum in several places. A half-functional vending unit had been hardwired into a long-range sensor rig. A small droid trundled past towing what looked like a repurposed missile booster labeled “trash burner.”

He was directed to Docking Bay Six with minimal ceremony. The dockmaster—a human wearing a stained Fleet shirt and flip-flops—simply pointed and said, “They’re that way. Don’t touch anything red.”

Syk’lis arrived at the airlock. The hull bore fresh impact damage. The serial codeplate was missing. A railgun mount above the port side had been visibly replaced, welded fast at an uncomfortably improvised angle. He activated his datapad and began logging.

“Hull wear inconsistent with known deployments. Recommend investigation into undocumented combat encounters.”

The airlock cycled open with a hollow thunk.

The ship’s AI greeted him with a neutral tone:

“Welcome aboard Calliope’s Curse. Don’t step left—containment’s twitchy today.”

He stepped forward.

The airlock shut behind him with a noise like a grumble. Inside, the ship was dim, vaguely humid, and smelled faintly of scorched polymer and some kind of meat product.

Panels were open. Wiring snaked along the ceiling in organized chaos. A console flickered with a hand-scrawled note taped over the interface:
“DO NOT TRUST TEMP READINGS”

A fire suppression drone followed him as he walked.

He looked back. It paused. He paused. The drone blinked one light. Then resumed its slow, stalking crawl.

Syk’lis opened a new file on his datapad.

Observation begins.

He tried not to look at the scorch marks along the floor.


Syk’lis met Captain Juno approximately twelve minutes after stepping aboard Calliope’s Curse. The captain was sitting in the command chair, one boot off, rubbing something dark and viscous off his palm with a rag that was clearly once a Fleet-issue towel. He didn’t rise when Syk’lis entered, merely looked up with a practiced disinterest that bordered on welcoming.

“If it starts vibrating,” Juno said, nodding toward a flickering side console, “leave the room.”

Syk’lis opened his mouth to ask for clarification, but the captain had already turned back to his console. The moment hung there — not hostile, not unfriendly, just… dismissively efficient.

He was quickly introduced to the ship’s engineer — or rather, she introduced herself. Chief Engineer Willis emerged from beneath a crawl panel near the reactor access hallway, hair frizzed by static, eyes alight with something Syk’lis could only label “dangerously alert.”

“You must be the liaison,” she said. “Tea?”

The mug she offered was radiating heat. The surface shimmered with something mildly viscous. It smelled like melted plastic and citrus. He took it out of politeness and held it with all six fingers carefully spaced.

“Don’t drink it too fast,” she said, disappearing back into the floor. “It hasn’t finished stabilizing.”

The following hours were a blur of attempted documentation and gradual unraveling of everything Syk’lis knew about functional military hierarchy. He attempted to map the command structure of Calliope’s Curse three times. Each version ended with question marks and circles.

Juno gave orders when he felt like it. Willis spoke more to the AI than to the captain. The weapons officer, a quiet human named Raye, seemed to be in charge during combat drills — but only when someone named Brisket wasn’t in the room. Brisket was a technician. Or a cook. Or both. Syk’lis gave up asking after the third response of “depends what needs doing.”

He began taking notes obsessively. Console interfaces were customized with nonstandard overlays — some drawn on with markers. Key systems were labeled with idioms like “Sweet Spot,” “Don’t Touch,” and “Pull Harder.” The latter, he discovered, was affixed to the primary railgun’s manual trigger. It was, as the note suggested, a large metal lever that looked like it had once belonged to a cargo crane.

There were no formal mission briefings. No logs read aloud. Decisions were made via shared glances, curt nods, or sometimes one-word phrases delivered with context Syk’lis couldn’t decipher. At first, he logged it all. He tried to correlate behavior with reaction. Assign structure to instinct.

Then something shifted.

It was during a routine systems drill. A minor fault warning began to echo through the corridors — a coolant relay failure in the secondary power bank. Syk’lis was halfway through writing it down when he realized the crew wasn’t reacting with panic or confusion. They moved.

Three humans rerouted flow through auxiliary channels without speaking. Willis barked something about “loop delay margin,” slapped the wall twice, and the lights surged back to normal. No alarm was silenced. No checklist confirmed. The problem was handled because it was expected. Anticipated. Practiced in a way that had no manual, no regulation. Just… experience.

Syk’lis blinked at his datapad. Then slowly closed the note he had been writing.

The ship changed him before he realized it. He still observed. Still catalogued. But now he watched differently. Not as a regulator. As a witness.

On the third day, Calliope’s Curse received a redirected mission from the outpost network: investigate a colony on Station Harthan-2A that had gone dark. No response to automated hails. No confirmed threat presence.

No support.

Syk’lis was briefed in the hallway while the crew prepped. It consisted of the captain pulling him aside, placing a hand on his shoulder, and saying:

“If anything explodes, follow the person who looks like they expected it.”

They jumped in cold. The station was a skeletal ring in orbit over a lifeless planet, lights dim, comms static. Two Eeshar raiders had already docked, gutting the place.

Calliope’s Curse accelerated without authorization. Raye adjusted power manually to weapons control. The AI activated targeting independently. Willis rerouted reactor output mid-burn to shunt shield power directly to engines. Syk’lis, sitting strapped into a diagnostics chair, watched as the ship moved like a living thing — not elegant, not graceful, but deliberate.

When one of the raiders broke off and turned toward them, Syk’lis expected a command. A shouted order. Instead, Brisket slid into a side console, flipped three switches with a practiced hand, and muttered, “Spit and spit again.”

The ship’s ventral gun activated and tore through the raider’s forward shield arc. It spiraled away, venting gas and fire.

The second raider tried to flee. They didn’t let it.

Somewhere between the railgun fire, the venting ozone, and the pulsing red of the alarms, Syk’lis realized someone had handed him a power cell mid-fight. He didn’t remember taking it. He didn’t know why he had it. But when Willis leaned in and said, “Plug that into the nav core now,” he didn’t question it.

He did it.

After the battle, the crew cleaned up. Quietly. No celebration. Just low conversation, efficient repairs, patched panels. Brisket handed out something resembling bread. Juno made coffee that Syk’lis was fairly certain had once powered a backup drive.

No one talked about the kill count. No one filed damage assessments.

Syk’lis sat in the galley, datapad open on the table in front of him. The report template blinked, still blank.

Eventually, he wrote.

“Human auxiliary command is not doctrinally compatible with GC structure. Do not interrupt. Observe. Do not correct. Support only when asked.”

He paused. Then closed the document.

He did not open the reassignment request file.

He did not look at his exit date.

He just sat quietly in the noise and the warmth and the strange smell of scorched bread and coffee and the faint buzz of something sparking — somewhere just out of sight.

And for the first time, he understood exactly how little he understood. And how much that might be okay.
Syk’lis took a bite of whatever Brisket handed him.
It was warm, slightly crunchy, and tasted like victory… and possibly insulation foam.

1klrqwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1klrqwy/my_toddler_is_tenacious_stubborn_and_way_too/,"My toddler is tenacious, stubborn, and way too intelligent. Help. Please.","I feel like Mugatu from Zoolander sometimes. “I feel like I’m taking crazy pills!” I don’t know what to do with this child’s tenacity and stubbornness. She’s 18 months old, and (according to our doctor) very advanced for her age in this area (WV so low bar, but I’ll take it). 

Here’s what’s going on: she hyper focuses on an objective and no matter the course correction- that’s her mission until my wife or I have made it physically impossible for her to get to the objective. Purple coffee mug? She’ll climb on the sofa to climb on the end table to get to it. I’ll cover the mug with my hand, remove her from the sofa, and she’ll climb back up and try to get it. I’ll move the mug- she’ll try to get it. It’s not until I fully remove the mug from the room that she stops. The gross ones are the pet water bowls and food bowls. This consistent behavior of persistence to a goal is exhausting and repetitive. Repetitive in the sense that, using the coffee mug for example, once the mug is removed, the target is now a photograph (which is out of her reach unless she climbs up the back of the rocking chair) or chasing the dogs until I segregate them or tearing at the blinds until I raise them or pulling books off the bookshelf and using them to hit or emptying her toy bins and using the toys to hit. 

My wife has a temper. Her dad was a teller and a spanker. I am an emotional person. My dad was a teller and a spanker. We both don’t want our daughter to have that parent who yells and spanks. We both have started yelling. My wife has shoved the child off of her when the kiddo slaps her or scratches her in the face. I yelled at her so much today that my throat hurt, aggressively grabbing the child from the dogs who have been so pestered they start growling when she’s near. She started climbing the bookshelf to get to this coffee mug today. I yanked her down. She put her face in the water bowls, I snatched her up by the arm. She repeatedly ran to eat cat food, I pulled her back by the shoulder. None of these instances happen on the first attempt either. The third, fourth, or fifth time is when I’ve noticed my self losing control. 

We have baby gates and high chairs. We can section off the pet bowls and food. But the bookshelves? The blinds? The rocking chair? The dogs can’t live in a back room and outside isn’t an option on rainy days like today. 

We distract or redirect often. Introduce toys like the stackable rings, nested stackable buckets, the hammer and pegs, shapes and holes bucket, interactive musical toys like electric toy pianos, the interactive leapfrog video game controller, imagination play with her stuffies, sing along playlists, dance playlists, and the last resort: television. If she’s hyper focused on an objective- these do not work. Not even television. Only full removal of objective, and that usually results in finding a new objective. 

Help. What do we do? 

Edit: spitting water out is another behavior we cannot redirect. She needs water to drink. She spits it out 75% of the time so she can splash it it. 

I write all this an hour after I broke down in tears because my yelling makes me feel like such a bad parent. 

Edit 2: any attempt to say “no, we don’t do that” while removing her from say climbing up the back of the rocking chair, results in her thinking it’s a game. We also praise good behavior like when she does choose to listen or when she chooses to sit in the chair instead of climbing. Things like not drinking dog water or eating cat kibble we don’t praise because how do you award praise for not doing that? ",2,1747156919.0,NewParents,4,1.0,False

You get this — a ProCharged, triple-tuned, E85-ready *monster* making over 800 horsepower **to the wheels**. This isn’t just another lifted truck at Cars & Coffee. This one’s built to **hook and book.**

We’ve seen a growing trend over the past few years: guys ditching the off-road setups and going full street/strip with late-model F-150s. Why?

* **Plenty of chassis strength**
* **Solid aftermarket support**
* And with the right tuning, a 5.0L Coyote paired with boost becomes a menace.

This build includes a Stage II ProCharger setup with three pulley configurations and tunes to match (base 93, max 93, and full E85). Supporting mods like triple-pump Fore Innovations fuel system, billet internals, long tubes, full exhaust, and a drop/drag suspension setup with CalTracs make this thing dead serious.

The real kicker? It’s clean. Custom leather, 22s, stereo system, even a roll-up bed cover. It’s fast **and** polished.

👉 [Here’s the full build and gallery from Gateway Classic Cars](https://www.gatewayclassiccars.com/vehicle/stl/9837/2019-ford-f150-procharged)

Modified vehicles are often hit or miss in the collector world, but **high-quality, well-documented, low-mile, purpose-built trucks like this are starting to gain serious traction**. With the rise of street truck racing at stripes and the aftermarket catching up fast, something like this could easily become tomorrow’s collectible — especially if the market keeps valuing clean, boosted V8 trucks the way it has lately.

Hoping to get some design help as I am totally stuck… We have a small home with the living room at the front of the house towards the neighborhood as relaxing as it is my favorite place to be is in what should be our “dining room” but we only host people a few times a year so we store our table I’m the garage and I’ve up-cycled my grandma’s chairs when we did her estate sale. Eventually my plants will be more spread out and the walls to the kitchen will be gone and have a more open layout but for the next year or two this is the current floor plan.

I may be working from home once a week in the near future and would like this to be a cozy relaxing space but one I can also work from.

My first idea was a small couch with a bar table and two stools that tuck in for my husband and I to have a little eating area and a little relaxing couch area that I could pull a coffee table up to and work but I’m having the hardest time finding a small couch that would work and not feel overbearing.

Please be kind as we aren’t financially savvy in this moment (new house, lots of renovating going on). Hoping for a little advice for my little home.

Yesterday I went to the capital and I stop by my favorite cafe, namely, Almanegra. I don't only take a coffee or something else but I also buy a bag of coffee beans there. It's something that I do at least once a month. I used to prepare specialty coffee everyday but it's a bit expensive. So now, I only prepare specialty coffee something like 10 days every month. This caffee started roasting their own beans, wich is great. Last year I had the opportunity to drop in some renowed coffee shops like Verve and Blue Bottle in San Francisco. Also Five Elephant in Berlin and don't get me wrong, the coffee there is great. But Almanegra has the same level or better. I think it has something to do with the knowledge of the  coffee bean roaster and that Mexico grows it's own coffee it's more fresh. Don't want to sound patriotic or something, I don't like those feelings.

They turned 10 years old last year. I think they opened up their first branch in 2025 but I had my first coffee there in 2026.

A friend of  mine told me something like there is an interesting new spot for coffee in this place, you should go. I remember that the Almanegra  was on my way home from university.  So I went there took my coffee and it was nice, but it was when I continued my commute route while waiting in the metro station. That the effects of flavour hit off, it was like what did I drink.

Comment now, and I’ll share the link shortly.","One night, Stanley received the divorce papers from Wendy. Her reason for wanting to get a divorce was due to his failing potency. Seeing him approach, Wendy smiled gracefully and asked, “Stanley, are you here for an andrology consultation?

One day, Wendy discovered that her husband Stanley was having an affair.

He had been seeing a college student.

It was Stanley's birthday. Wendy had prepared a table full of dishes early in the day. Just then, she heard a notification from his phone.

Ding!

He had left his phone at home.

Wendy switched it on and saw a text from the college student.

\[I hurt myself when I was carrying the cake. It hurts so much.\]

Attached was a selfie—not of the sender's face, but of her legs. The girl in the photo wore pulled-up white socks, black leather shoes, and a blue-and-white skirt that had been pushed up to reveal her long, slender legs. Her pale knees were visibly reddened from the bump. The youthful, vibrant image of her body paired with coquettish words exuded a forbidden allure.

People often say successful businessmen like Stanley favored this type of woman when choosing mistresses.

Wendy clutched the phone tightly, her fingers turning white from the pressure.

Ding!

Another text came from the college student.

""Mr. Hawk, see you at Cloud Hotel tonight. I want to celebrate your birthday!""

So, his mistress wanted to celebrate his birthday tonight.

Wendy grabbed her bag and headed straight to Cloud Hotel. She had to see for herself who this college student was.

She soon arrived at the hotel, ready to go in. Just then, she saw her parents, Harry and Lilian at the entrance. Surprised, she walked up to them.

""Dad, Mom, what are you doing here?"" she asked.

Harry and Lilian, caught off guard, exchanged a glance before responding to her hesitantly.

""Wendy, your sister's back in the country. We brought her here,"" Harry said.

'Jessica?'

Through the hotel's gleaming floor-to-ceiling windows, Wendy spotted her sister Jessica and immediately froze.

Jessica was wearing the exact same blue-and-white skirt from the photo in Stanley's phone. The college student was none other than her own sister!

Jessica had always been a beauty, known as the 'Red Rose of Hovendale,' and she was famed for having the most beautiful legs in town. Many men had been captivated by her charm. And now, her darling sister was using those legs to seduce her husband.

Wendy found it laughable. She turned to her parents and said coldly, ""So I'm the last to know?""

Harry gave a sheepish smile. ""Wendy, Mr. Hawk doesn't even like you.""

""Exactly, Wendy,"" Lilian chimed in. ""Do you know how many women in Hovendale are dying to be with Mr. Hawk? Better to let Jessica have him than some other woman.""

Wendy clenched her fists. ""Dad, Mom, I'm your daughter too!""

Turning on her heel, she started walking away.

Lilian called after her. ""Wendy, tell me—has Mr. Hawk ever touched you?""

Wendy stopped in her tracks.

Harry's voice turned sharp. ""Wendy, don't act like we owe you anything. Three years ago, when Stanley and Jessica were Hovendale's golden couple, everyone thought they'd get married. But then Stanley got into a car accident and went into a coma. That's the only reason we had you marry him instead.""

Lilian gave Wendy a disdainful once-over. ""Look at yourself, Wendy. In the past three years, you've turned into a housewife who revolves around her husband. Meanwhile, Jessica became the principal ballerina of her company. She's a white swan, and you're just an ugly duckling. What do you have to compete with Jessica? Just give Mr. Hawk back to her already.""

Every word felt like a knife into Wendy's chest. Tears filling her eyes, she walked away.

\-

Back at the villa, night had fallen. Wendy had sent the maid Mathilda home, so the house was empty, dark, and cold.

She sat alone at the dining table.

The once-warm meal had gone cold. The cake she had carefully prepared had 'Happy Birthday, Honey' written on it in frosting.

It was glaringly ironic, just like her existence—a complete joke.

Stanley and Jessica had been the golden couple of Hovendale, with Jessica as Stanley's cherished 'Red Rose.' But three years ago, a sudden car accident left Stanley in a vegetative state and Jessica disappeared entirely.

That was when the Crone family brought Wendy back from the countryside and forced her to marry Stanley in Jessica's place. Wendy had agreed willingly when she found out it was Stanley—the man she had loved all along.

For three years, Stanley remained in a coma. During those years, Wendy devoted herself to caring for him. She stayed by his side, gave up socializing, and focused solely on nursing him back to health, living as a dutiful housewife. In the end, her efforts paid off. Stanley woke up.

Wendy lit the candles on the cake.

The flickering glow illuminated her reflection in the nearby mirror—a plain housewife in a dull black-and-white dress, devoid of charm or excitement.

Meanwhile, Jessica, now a successful ballerina, was young, vibrant, and beautiful.

Wendy was an ugly duckling, while Jessica was the white swan.

After waking up, Stanley abandoned the ugly duckling and returned to the white swan's side.

Wendy let out a bitter laugh.

This wasn't love; it was self-delusion. Stanley had never loved her, but she had loved him. The first one to fall in love always lost.

Today, Stanley had made her lose completely.

Tears welled in her eyes as she blew out the candles, plunging the villa back into darkness.

Just then, two bright headlights pierced through the night. Stanley's car sped up the driveway and came to a halt on the lawn.

Wendy's eyelashes quivered. He had come back. She had thought he wouldn't return tonight.

The villa door opened and Stanley stepped in, carrying the cool air of the night with him.

Stanley Hawk, the heir of the Hawk family, had been a business prodigy from a very young age. By 16, he had earned dual master's degrees from Harfield. Later, he took Hawk Group public in Hawthorne, making a name for himself internationally before returning home to lead the company as Hovendale's wealthiest man.

Stanley walked in.

""Why didn't you turn on the lights?"" he asked in a deep, magnetic voice as he turned on the wall lamp with a click.

The sudden brightness made Wendy blink. When her eyes adjusted, she looked at him.

Dressed in a custom-tailored black suit, Stanley exuded a cold, aristocratic elegance that left countless socialites dreaming of him at night.

""It's your birthday,"" she said.

Stanley's handsome face remained indifferent as his gaze swept lazily over the dining table. ""Don't waste your time on this again. I don't celebrate such occasions.""

Wendy smiled faintly. ""Is it that you don't celebrate, or you just don't want to celebrate with me?""

Stanley glanced at her, his gaze impassive. ""Think what you like.""

With that, he turned around and started up the stairs.

He had always been like this—distant and cold. No matter what she did, she could never warm his heart.

Wendy stood and called after him. ""It's your birthday today. I have a gift for you.""

However, Stanley didn't stop or turn around. ""I don't need it.""

Wendy let out a soft chuckle and said, ""Stanley, let's get a divorce.""

Stanley froze mid-step, one foot already on the staircase. He turned around, his deep black eyes locking onto her.

**Chapter 2**

Wendy was also staring at him. Her tone was light but firm as she repeated, ""Let's get a divorce, Stanley. Do you like your birthday gift?""

Stanley didn't bat an eyelid. ""You're asking for a divorce just because I didn't celebrate my birthday with you?""

""Jessica has returned, hasn't she?""

At the mention of Jessica, Stanley's thin lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. He took a step forward, closing the distance between them. ""Are you bothered by Jessica?""

Stanley, known as the youngest business prodigy alive, exuded an aura of power, wealth, and status. As he approached, Wendy instinctively stepped back, her slender back pressing against the cold wall.

Her vision went dark as Stanley leaned in. He propped one hand against the wall beside her, trapping her between his firm chest and the wall.

Looking down at her with his deep, striking eyes, Stanley sneered.

""Everyone in Hovendale knows Jessica was the one I intended to marry. Weren't you aware when you schemed to replace her and became Mrs. Hawk? You didn’t mind then, so why act all self-righteous now?""

Wendy's face turned pale.

Yes, Stanley had wanted to marry Jessica. If not for the accident that left him in a coma, how could Wendy have married him?

She would never forget the day he woke up. The disappointment and coldness in his eyes when he saw her was devastating.

Since then, they had lived in separate rooms. He never touched her.

He loved Jessica.

Wendy had always known this, but...

She gazed deeply at Stanley's face, the grown man overlapping in her mind with the young boy from years ago.

'Stanley, do you really not remember me?'

It turned out she had been standing in place all along, waiting for someone that no longer existed.

It was enough.

These three years were just her one-sided effort to cherish him.

Suppressing the ache in her heart, Wendy said softly, ""Stanley, let's end this loveless marriage.""

Stanley's brows arched sharply, and his deep, magnetic voice could be heard. ""Loveless?""

He raised his hand, gripping her delicate chin, his thumb brushing against her crimson lips in a provocative motion. ""Is that why? Are you asking for a divorce because of that? Do you want it that badly?""

Wendy's delicate face flushed red like a ripe berry, vibrant and tempting.

That wasn’t what she meant!

Yet his thumb lingered on her lips, pressing and toying with them. She hadn't expected such a composed and distinguished man to have such a teasing, roguish side.

Stanley was seeing Wendy up close for the first time. She usually dressed in monotonous black-and-white outfits, paired with oversized black-framed glasses, presenting herself like an old maid.

But up close, he realized her face was barely the size of his palm, and her delicate features exuded a quiet elegance beneath those glasses. Her dark pupils were stunningly beautiful.

Her lips were soft, their plush surface springing back with a subtle elasticity wherever his thumb pressed.

It stirred an unbidden thought.

Stanley’s gaze darkened. ""I didn’t expect you to be so eager. You’re that desperate for a man, aren’t you?""

Slap!

Wendy raised her hand and slapped him across the face. Stanley’s handsome face tilted to the side from the impact.

Wendy’s fingers trembled with anger. She realized that loving someone too humbly only led to her dignity being trampled on. He had actually humiliated her.

Furious, she declared, ""I know you’ve never stopped thinking about Jessica. Fine, I’ll fulfill your wishes and return Mrs. Hawk’s title to her!""

Stanley’s face instantly darkened, frosty and sullen. A man of his stature had never been slapped before—never!

His sharp gaze locked onto her. ""Wendy, you married me when it was convenient for you, and now you want a divorce just because you feel like it. What do you take me for?""

Wendy let out a soft chuckle. ""A plaything.""

""What?""

Stanley’s expression stiffened.

Wendy forced herself to endure the pain in her heart and said what she knew would hurt him. ""You’re just a toy I took from Jessica. I’m done playing, so I’m tossing you aside.""

Stanley’s expression turned grim, his mood darkening to the point where it could drip with venom. ""Fine! Wendy, you’re something else. Let’s divorce, but don’t come crying back to me, begging for reconciliation!""

He stormed upstairs, slamming the study door shut with a deafening bang.

Wendy felt as though all the strength had been drained from her body. Slowly, she slid down the wall, crouching on the carpet. Hugging her knees, she whispered to herself, 'Stanley, I won’t love you anymore.'

\-

The next morning, Mathilda entered the study.

Stanley was seated at his desk, reviewing documents. He was a notorious workaholic.

""Sir,"" Mathilda greeted Stanley cautiously.

Stanley didn’t even look up. His icy aura hinted at his foul mood. It felt cold being around him.

Mathilda carefully placed a cup of coffee by his hand. ""Sir, this coffee was made by Mrs. Hawk.""

Stanley’s pen paused mid-air, his cold expression softening slightly.

Was she trying to make amends?

Truth be told, Wendy was an excellent wife. She cooked to his preferences, hand-washed his clothes, and meticulously managed his daily needs.

Stanley picked up the coffee, taking a sip. It was her coffee—the taste he liked.

But he was still angry.

She had slapped him last night, and he wasn’t about to let that go easily. A single cup of coffee wouldn’t suffice as an apology.

""Did she admit she was wrong?"" Stanley asked.

Mathilda glanced at him hesitantly. ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk has left.""

Stanley froze, looking up at Mathilda.

She handed him a piece of paper. ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk left this with her suitcase and asked me to give this to you before she left.""

Stanley unfolded the paper. The words 'Divorce Agreement' caught his eye.

His expression darkened. He thought she was trying to reconcile.

Mathilda added cautiously, ""Sir, Mrs. Hawk asked you to finish the coffee before signing the divorce papers.""

Stanley glared at the coffee. ""Throw it out! All of it!""

'Sir, you seemed to like the coffee just fine a moment ago. Why don't you anymore?' Mathilda thought to herself.

Without saying another word, she quickly left with the coffee.

Stanley’s face was a thunderstorm, his mood in turmoil. He skimmed through the divorce agreement. She wasn’t asking for a penny—she intended to leave with nothing.

Stanley scoffed coldly. It was bold of her to act like she didn’t need his money. How would a country girl like her survive without it?

It was then that his gaze landed on the reason for divorce, handwritten by Wendy herself.

""Due to my husband’s physical dysfunction, he cannot fulfill his marital obligations.""

Stanley froze, his handsome face turning completely dark.

'That woman!'

He grabbed his phone and dialed Wendy’s number.

The line connected, and Wendy’s voice came through clearly. ""Hello?""

**Chapter 3**

Stanley's thin lips curved into a frosty arc. ""Wendy, get back here immediately!""

Wendy chuckled. ""You expect me to come back just because you said so? We're divorced, Stanley. I'm not going to continue indulging you!""

Stanley clenched his jaw. ""I'll give you a chance to rewrite the reason for divorce!""

Wendy's tone grew more playful.

""Did I write anything wrong? Stanley, it's been six months since you woke up, hasn't it? Yet, in these six months, you haven't even held my hand. You were in a coma for three years, and although you're physically healthy now, I have legitimate reasons to believe you've developed functional problems. You're not potent anymore! Better hurry to find an experienced naturopath. As our parting gift, I wish you an early recovery of your manhood!""

Stanley was rendered speechless. The veins on his forehead were visibly twitching.

This woman was out of control.

""Wendy, I'll make you regret this! You'll know what I'm capable of sooner or later!""

""Sorry, but you'll never get the chance!""

""Wendy!""

The call abruptly ended with two cold beeps. He hadn't even had time to explode in anger before hearing the disconnected tone.

'Wendy…!'

Wendy had already arrived at her best friend Cecelia Sunder's apartment. After she hung up the phone, Cecelia burst out laughing and gave her a big thumbs-up.

""Wendy, that was amazing! Stanley must be so furious, he's spitting blood right now.""

Wendy reflected that she had been too humble in the past, which had allowed him to act superior to her for so long.

'Love yourself first. A woman must always prioritize self-love.'

""Three years ago, when Jessica learned Stanley went into a coma after the car accident, she immediately ran away. Now that he's awake, he's crawling back to her? What a joke! You're better off without a man like that,"" Cecelia commented.

Wendy unwrapped a candy and popped it into her mouth. The sweetness seemed to mask the bitterness in her heart. ""That's how you tell if you're loved or not, Cecelia.""

Those who were loved were fearless. Those who weren't lived in constant insecurity.

Cecelia noticed Wendy had already gone through a pile of candies. She pulled Wendy to her feet.

""Wendy, cheer up! When you give up one tree, you'll discover an entire forest waiting for you. Tonight, I'm booking eight male hosts to celebrate you becoming single!""

Wendy covered her forehead and laughed.

Cecelia suddenly snatched Wendy's black-rimmed glasses off her face, tossing them into the trash.

Wendy tried to retrieve them. ""My glasses—""

Cecelia stopped her. ""Wendy, you've been in academic research for too long, and you've gotten used to wearing these glasses. But you should take a page out of Jessica's book and doll yourself up.""

Wendy thought about how her parents had always told her she was an ugly duckling while Jessica was a swan. It wasn't just her parents—Stanley must have thought the same. In his eyes, she was just an ugly duckling too.

Cecelia dragged Wendy to the door. ""Come on, we're going shopping! Hair, nails, clothes—everything! I want Stanley and everyone else to see how stunning you can be!""

As they walked out, Cecelia suddenly remembered something. ""Oh, Wendy, are you really not taking any money from Stanley after the divorce?""

""I have my own money,"" Wendy replied.

""Letting Jessica spend Stanley's money instead? Jessica says thank you!"" Cecelia teased.

Wendy didn't know what to say to that.

""What about the card Stanley gave you?"" Cecelia pressed.

Stanley was always generous and had given Wendy a premium black card. However, she had never used it.

Wendy pulled the black card out of her purse and winked playfully. ""Today, I'll splurge—and let Stanley foot the bill.""

That evening, at 1996 Bar.

1996 Bar was Hovendale's playground for the rich, where young heirs and the city's elites spent extravagantly. The music was never-ending, and the dance floor was wild.

In a luxurious and dimly lit booth, Stanley sat in the center of a leather sofa. Tonight, he had on a black shirt paired with black trousers. His sleeves were rolled up to his elbows, revealing his toned forearms and a steel watch worth millions. His aristocratic, striking features made him the center of attention, drawing glances from countless women in the bar.

Beside him was his close friend, Benny Gondale—the heir of the Gondale family—and several other young elites.

Benny laughed. ""Stanley, are you serious? Wendy wants a divorce?""

The others laughed along. ""Everyone knows Wendy loves Stanley to the bone. When he was in a coma, she insisted on marrying him. There's no way she'd actually go through with a divorce.""

""Let's bet on it. How long do you think Wendy can hold out before begging Stanley to take her back?""

Benny smirked. ""I bet she can't even make it through tonight. She's probably already sent Stanley a message.""

Stanley's chiseled features remained cold and sharp, his mood clearly sour. He pulled out his phone and opened WhatsApp to check their chat history.

The last message from Wendy was from last night. She had sent a photo of the broth with the caption, \[Honey, even though your bone density is back to normal, you should still drink this broth regularly. Don't come home too late!\]

As he scrolled up, he saw countless similar messages—all from Wendy. She messaged him every day.

He had never replied. Not once.

Today, the chat was silent.

Stanley felt a vague sense of irritation.

Ding!

A notification popped up.

""See? I told you—Wendy messaged you!"" Benny immediately exclaimed.

Ding, ding, ding!

Several more notifications followed in quick succession.

The group burst out laughing. ""We knew it—Wendy couldn't hold out! But we didn't expect her to cave so fast.""

""Stanley, open them. Let's see how Wendy is begging you to reconcile,"" Benny urged.

Stanley's sharp eyebrows lifted slightly. Did she really send a message? If she regretted it so quickly, why did she make such a fuss this morning?

He tapped on the notifications, only to freeze.

Benny leaned over and read aloud, ""Dear VVIP customer, your card ending in 0975 has been charged 800 at Dazzling Nail Salon.""

The group collectively frowned.

Stanley scrolled further.

2,000.

86,000.

240,000.

There were no messages about reconciliations, only transaction notifications. The group fell silent, feeling like Wendy had slapped them all hard in the face.

Stanley's expression darkened and he slammed his phone onto the table. He didn't care how much money Wendy spent. What bothered him was that she had gone on a shopping spree right after their divorce. This woman was something else!

The once submissive Wendy, who had clung to him for three years, now seemed to have grown fangs.

""Stanley, what's Wendy up to? She's gone to do her nails and hair, and buy clothes. Is she trying to imitate Jessica?"" Benny commented.

""Jessica is Hovendale's Red Rose. Wendy's just a country bumpkin. No matter how hard she tries, she'll only be a pale imitation.""

""A swan is a swan. An ugly duckling will always be an ugly duckling.""

Everyone laughed at Wendy.

Suddenly, there was a commotion in the bar. All eyes turned toward the entrance.

Someone gasped, ""Look—an angel just walked in!""",1,1747156479.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

All of the foods to avoid are things I love tomatoes chocolate coffee all of that am I never going to be able to enjoy those foods again? I also went to the allergist recently and was told I'm extremely allergic to dust mites as well as trees so I was taking Zyrtec which I think is making the LPR worse. I have really bad post nasal drip as well which I think is contributing to the hoarseness and throat clearing. I can't even speak I cancel plans with my friends because I'm worried my lpr will act up and I'm going to begin a coughing fit or try to speak and have my voice come out very hoarse and everyone wonder what's wrong with my voice now. Should I stop the Zyrtec and only stick with the Omeprazole?

I moved to Paris around 5 years ago. While the city is beautiful and full of exciting things to do, I always find meeting new people here isn’t always easy.

People come and go. Social circles are tight. And as an expat, it’s easy to feel like we are on the outside looking in — especially if you're someone with big ideas or personal projects you’re passionate about.

That’s why I started ***Brio*** — a small community project I’ve been building with another expat here.

Each Sunday, we match people in Paris for small, in-person coffee chats — just you and 3 other motivated thinkers sitting around a table, sharing ideas, thoughts and passions.

We review every application so that each group feels thoughtfully matched. Our only ""requirement"" is that you’re someone who gets excited about ideas — whether you're building a startup, writing a book, launching a channel, or simply exploring what’s next.

We’ve been running these meetups for a few months now, and the feedback has been really heartwarming. People walk away feeling inspired, less alone, and sometimes even with new collaborators or friends.

If this resonates with you, you can apply at [brio.im/apply](https://brio.im/apply) — it’s foreigner-friendly, and we’d really love to meet more like-minded people in the city 💛

Now I built my first real AI product, alone. Here's how I broke this damn loop.","# A few months ago, I realized I wasn’t building anything real.

I’d open YouTube “just for 5 minutes”… and 2 hours later I was deep into tech explainers, productivity gurus, startup story rabbit holes. I told myself it was learning. But truth? It was procrastination in disguise.

My ""watch later"" list became a graveyard. My ideas? Half-cooked. My MVPs? Stuck in Notion.

I live in Vietnam. I don’t know many solopreneurs around me. Most people want a safe job, not to ship software alone for strangers on the internet. But something in me wanted to try. To make something useful. To finish something.

So I did.

🚀 I launched my first product [VidSummify](http://vidsummify.pro/landing) this week (Launched on product hunt just yesterday)  
It’s a simple AI tool that solves a problem I personally had: wasting hours trying to keep up with too many YouTube channels.  
Now I get one clean email each morning with the important stuff — summarized. No chaos. No guilt.

I read dozens of self-help books, but nothing changed.  
**Only action works**.

What changed?  
It wasn’t some magic productivity system. It was these 3 lessons:

# 1. 5-Second Rule (Mel Robbins style)

If there’s a hard task (like setting up DNS, buying a domain, or writing the damn copy), I count: 5-4-3-2-1 — and I start.  
No negotiation. No overthinking. Just start.  
It saved me every time I felt weak.

# 2. 2-Minute Rule

If a task takes less than 2 minutes (checking an email, pushing code, opening the design file), I do it right away.  
Small wins stack up fast.

# 3. Time Blocking + Micro-deadlines (I learn this from Elon Musk)

I don’t wait for inspiration. I block time — just 30 mins — and I make the task small.  
Not “build landing page”, but “write 1 intro sentence in 15 mins.”  
Urgency is born from limits.

This project started as a weekend experiment. Now I use it daily. And honestly, it changed how I approach building anything.

I feel stronger now.  
Not because I raised money or got thousands of users.  
But because I finished something real.  
I picked the hard task. I showed up. I created.

If you're stuck in the loop like I was — half-working, half-consuming — maybe it’s time.  
Pick your idea. Launch something weird.  
Finish something small. Even ugly. Even imperfect.

Because the day you hit ""publish"" on something real — even a tiny SaaS — is the day you stop being a wantrepreneur.

And start becoming a builder.  
I built this with late nights, coffee, and a lot of unknowns — but I know one thing for sure: community is the best growth hack.

So tell me honestly:

I’ll reply to every comment.

1klrgpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverdating/comments/1klrgpo/38m4f_looking_for_someone_to_date/,38M4F Looking for someone to date,"Hi! I've been living in Vancouver for over six and a half years. I moved here from Ireland and I work as an English language teacher in a school based downtown. 

I'm 5 foot 4 and very active - I'm a lightweight bodybuilder and go to the gym six days a week, most days I go twice a day to do my cardio at 6am before I teach and my workout in the afternoon.

I'm very extroverted with a lot of energy and very passionate about everything in life. In saying that, I'd say 95% of my friends (especially in Vancouver) are introverted, which is probably a good balance. I actually met most of my friends through the r/Vancouver4Friends sub and some of them have become very close friends of mine. I've also met a lot of people online and through Reddit & the couchsurfing app (those were the days!) and travelling.

My interests aside from the gym are:

\- cafe-hopping - I'm huge into coffee and love visiting cafes; 

\- food - I'm a massive foodie and I absolutely love to cook and bake. I host Christmas dinner at my place every year and I prepare the whole thing for my friends. I'm definitely a proud baker as I love to put my own spin on things. Just wait till you try my brownie-cookie stuffed with everything and topped with salted caramel sauce! I find cooking & especially baking very therapeutic. I have a huge sweet tooth - this is one of the reasons I go to the gym!

\- horror movies - I'm more into paranormal/demonic horror but love slasher movies such as Scream. Really excited for the upcoming releases of Final Destination 6, I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Conjuring 4, and Scream 7. I'm one of those people that doesn't get scared by horrors, so I enjoy laughing when my friends get scared. :D

\- travel stories and life experiences - I always love sharing and listening to experiences people have had in any part of their life, particularly travelling. Probably my most favourite thing about travelling is the food. I always love learning new things about different cultures.

\- Korean dramas and anything Korean - my best friend lives in Seoul and I had the time of my life visiting him two years ago. I'm returning later this year and can't wait. I take a huge interest in Korean culture and especially the food. I've watched a ton of Korean dramas, and for someone who is really not into romantic movies, I'm really into how the Koreans do romance in their shows!

\- self-development books - I got into reading over a year ago. The stuff I tend to prefer are things that can help you learn about yourself. Some books I've read are The Secret, Don't Believe Everything You Think, and stuff by Neville Goddard.

I'm looking for a woman who has similar interests, especially regarding exercise. I think health is important and it's good to look after yourself. It's a bonus for me if you go to the gym but this isn't so important. Just someone who enjoys staying active in whatever way works for them. It's important for me to be with someone who values movement and feels good doing everyday things, like taking the stairs without it being a struggle.

Sense of humour is important. I really enjoy banter and making jokes, so would like someone who doesn't take themselves too seriously and finds everything funny like I do. 

I have a very optimistic outlook on life, and my friends tell me that my positive energy is addictive. I always have a smile on my face and always look at the positives in life - in a way that is not naive (I've a lot of life experience at this stage). It would be nice to meet someone who is similar where we can encourage each other. I easily feel drained by people who are really negative, complain/worry all the time, or who constantly seek validation.

I'm not into anime as an overall but I'm a massive Dragon Ball fan, just like most gym guys.

I am based in Downtown Vancouver but would be happy to meet someone in the vicinity of easily accessible. Coquitlam, North Vancouver, Surrey, and Richmond are as far as I would be willing to travel (especially because I don't drive).

In terms of what I'm looking for regarding dating, my attitude is just to take it one date at a time and see where it goes. I've been living life solo for many years but would like to get into the dating field and see who I meet and what can happen. 

Thanks for reading my post, and if you are interested I will be happy to have you DM me. :D",1,1747156255.0,vancouverdating,0,1.0,False

“Bakit kinikilig po kayo pareho?”
Not even a good evening! HAHAHA!
To my awkward face, I wondered—how did he notice? Then he added,
“Yung aura niyo po kasi, ma’am. Boyfriend niyo po ba?”


Hey S!

It’s been two years since we last caught up. Ever since then, our friends have always teased us:
“Bakit hindi na lang kayo?”
We just laughed it off—we couldn’t imagine ending up together.

We first met six years ago, just hanging out and getting to know each other while waiting for our friends at 7-Eleven. Even then, it felt like we’d known each other for a long time. As time passed, we’d go out together—sometimes with friends, sometimes just the two of us since we lived nearby. Midnight strolls, food trips, travel… anything under the sun.

Eventually, you found out about my anxiety, and on your own, you learned how to handle it—especially during my attacks. You were always one call away. You even enjoyed spending time with my siblings and cousins. Our friends had no idea how deeply you cared for me.

But things changed. You had a girlfriend, and you brought her to our friends’ and family getaways. Everyone was shocked—they thought we were going to end up together. I told them we were just friends. But deep down, I hated to admit that I had already fallen in love.
Doon ko lang napagtanto na gusto pala kita—nung nagka-girlfriend ka na.
I would always tell our friends how lucky she was to have you. Secretly, I wished it was me.

Months later, we both had our own partners. Life got busy. Boundaries and priorities changed. And slowly, the love I had for you faded.

Then, five years later, we had an unexpected catch-up. Who would’ve thought we’d end up in the same city again, after all our individual plans and growth? I found out you had broken up with your ex, while I was in a new relationship—the one you thought I’d end up with. HAHAHA! We updated each other on life—chikahan about anything under the sun. Of course, our favorite thing: karaoke!

But we lost contact again. You were busy healing, and I was busy with work and a new relationship.

Now it’s 2025—and we caught up again. We met at the same mall where we last saw each other two years ago. As usual, life updates, a quick grocery run, and coffee. You asked me about my last relationship. I asked if you liked someone new. And just like that—we found out we were both single. Again. What a plot twist!

I remembered when one of our friends caught us off guard during our 2020 trip and asked:
“Do you consider falling in love with your best friend?”

I laughed. I couldn’t imagine being with you. I was afraid of losing you, afraid we’d ruin what we already had.

You just nodded.

I’m sorry for the chances I pushed you away over silly things—never realizing that you were already waiting for a hint that I liked you too. I was too numb to feel, too dumb to recognize that you were already showing your intentions.
Hindi ko alam kung noob lang ako o dahil hindi rin malinaw.
I didn’t want to assume anything because you never said it directly.

But if the universe gave us another chance—and your intentions were finally clear—I wouldn’t hesitate.
I’d take a chance on this kind of love, and take what we have… to the next level.",0,1747156170.0,PinoyUnsentLetters,1,0.5,False

1klreko,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1klreko/first_date/,First date,"My husband (40m, call him A) and I (31f) have been talking seriously about opening our marriage since August. He brought it up, though we’ve talked about it on and off since we’ve been together (8.5 years). We’ve always discussed that if we did it, I’d need to go first. A has a friend who will be in town next month and he’d like to explore his connection with her, so I’ve been trying to figure out how to find someone that I could test the waters with. 

I’ve been anxious and not confident about dating again. It’s been a long time and I’ve had a kid, so I haven’t been super confident in my body. 

After many discussions with A I downloaded FeelD. I connected with someone (call him B) on Friday who is from my city but doesn’t live here, and was in town for a wedding and to see his family. We went on a coffee date and had a really nice chat. B was really open about his situation and how he became poly. He was just super kind and transparent and made me feel comfortable even though I was nervous. 

We got coffee again Sunday and kissed! It was nice and new and overall a wonderful second date. B was again just really kind and open. 

I know B will be back around the area in October. He mentioned that he’d have to come back sooner and that he’d like if I texted him. He has someone that he’s not in a relationship with currently but would like to get back together with. B is poly but I’m not sure what his other entanglements are like, if any. 

I’d like to stay in touch with B and get to know him better in a low pressure way. I like having someone who will be back once in a while that I can explore with, but I can tell I’m going to take a while to open up myself and continuing our conversation from afar feels like a good way to make it more effective when B is back. Does anyone have advice for how to open the dialogue with B? I don’t want to come off too intense but I’m excited about this new connection. Definitely would be (am?) feeling NRE if he actually lived here. 

Any other advice in general for this situation? TIA! ",1,1747156111.0,nonmonogamy,3,1.0,False

(FUE 2,000 grafts hair | FUE 600 grafts brows)","To preface, I did not get to draw out the designs today with Dr. Path. His staff told me we will draw the designs tomorrow and proceed with the surgery. Other logistics stuff was done, though. Guessed they were busy.

His staff are super nice and speak good English. Got there and was first asked to fill out my medical history in the lobby. One of the front desk staff asked me where I'm staying and what my room number is. They told me that Dr. Path will have someone arrange to take me home on the day of surgery (or something like that, sorry I was out of it, so I don't even remember, but something like that)? I didn't have a Thai phone number, so I gave them WhatsApp or Line, and they added me on WhatsApp.

Afterwards, one of the doctors working for Dr. Path called me in and asked about my medical history and family hair loss history. He then showed me a powerpoint of basic hair transplant stuff, like some post-op FUE/FUT results, pros/cons of both, hair growth cycle, etc. After, he took BP, and he sprayed some water onto my hair, combed it, and used a trichoscope to measure density.

To preface, I don't remember the exact number, but these are probably ±2 of the actual values. Anyways, the sides have like 48 and 54 grafts per cm², which he said was ok. The front has 38. He said the back was very high — 94 grafts per cm² (or 96?).  I brought up the fact that I want my hair to be as dense as possible, but was informed that implanting too many grafts at once can affect the survival rate. He told me Dr. Path does about 50-60 grafts per cm² max. I will need a second surgery to add density, which I'm ok with.

He then took me upstairs, and one of Dr. Path's technicians/nurses gave me a consent form to sign and the pre-op instructions again. She also sprayed my hair with water, combed it, and took pictures of various angles of both my hair and brows. After, I asked her some questions I had about the surgery.

I forgot to bring my min/fin stash, so they gave me a month's worth (900 THB). I read from other people's posts that Dr. Path's clinic only offers a wash/follow-up the day after surgery. Since I'm staying until the 21st (surgery is on the 14th), I asked them if they offer daily follow-up washes (since I'm lazy haha). She said yes, but I have to come in the afternoon when they're less busy since they perform surgeries in the morning, which I am totally ok with. I asked about the sleeping position, to which she says I can even lie flat down if needed (🤔) so long as the recipient area isn't touched. The neck pillow is still needed to lock my head in place, though. Head above the heart, so don't bend down to put on shoes. Just squat down instead. I can sleep by tilting my head to one side while using a neck pillow (since I find it very difficult to sleep by tucking my chin or by leaning back, but turning my head to the side works for some reason). Yes, it's ok if the donor touches the neck pillow while I sleep. If I still experience pain weeks after the surgeries and I run out of pain medication, typical Tylenol and Advil will do. I can start applying aloe vera gel/some spray to help with itching 7 days after the surgery. A bandana will be given, and I can wear it at the airport, and it's totally ok. One last thing, this was stated in the pre-op: ""Shampoo your hair with antiseptic shampoo for 5 minutes twice the night before the surgery and in the morning of surgery”. I asked her for further clarification. So at night, apply it first time and rinse off right away. For the second time, the shampoo is left on for 5m and then washed off. Morning is just leave on 5m and then wash off. That's pretty much all of my questions.

I also asked if I can lose weight after the surgery. I told her that it won't be a crash diet and will be gradual. I already lost \~66lbs, but looking to lose another 60. She said I should save that question for Dr. Path tomorrow, but she said it should be ok so long as I eat a lot of protein (easy, I eat >200g/day pretty consistently since it's a carnivore-ish diet). I will also ask Dr. Path if he recommends I stay in Bangkok for a few extra days. I've read the posts about when the transplanted hair is secured, but I'm pretty irrational and paranoid about it still, though my rational mind says leaving on the 21st with my surgery on the 14th is good. It's at the 7th day mark by the time I leave (or a little over 6.5 days to be exact). I just have irrational fears about people dropping their luggage onto my head or bumping to me when I sleep or some stupid crap like that haha (I have the aisle seat).

After that, I went downstairs and paid for my surgery. I'm guessing they relied on what Dr. Path initially estimated in his email — 2,000 grafts for the hair (not including temporal peaks, which is something I decided on doing a few weeks ago) and 600 grafts for the brows. I was a bit swayed towards FUT when one of the other doctors went over his powerpoint, so they charged me for FUT for now. Paid for everything (oof 3% card fee), but I will change it to FUE tomorrow. The lizard brain took over for a second with that FUT decision. Anyways, they also charged me for the Covid/HIV/Hep C test tomorrow (900 THB), but I had already done the HIV/Hep C test a few weeks before my surgery in the states (I brought a paper copy so they can photocopy it), so I only have the Covid test left (300 THB).

I paid a $1,000 deposit to confirm the appointment a few months ago, and I bank transferred them another $4,000 5 days ago before I got to Bangkok, so I only paid an additional \~$3,800 from my card today. Again, this charge is for FUT, so it will be another \~$1,500 charge tomorrow (so probably like a little over $10,000). They then asked me if I drink coffee (mentioned in the pre-op to skip the morning of surgery), to which I said no. Everyone was really friendly. I made it very clear that I am needle-adverse and am anxious about the pain, and kinda just joked about it a bit. They told me it won't be that bad. Hope not. My nerves are calmed, though, after talking with them. Again, great people!

Ordered Grab and went home after. Showered with the antiseptic shampoo as instructed. Will just order room-service food from the bar post-op so I don't have to go down to the lobby to pick up food. I don't really snack, so I didn't stock up on anything. Just water mainly. I look forward to tomorrow. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",1,1747155963.0,HairTransplants,0,1.0,False

1klr6db,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1klr6db/overwhelmed_and_struggling_to_function/,Overwhelmed and struggling to function,"I'm 25. I was diagnosed at 21 with severe ADHD and currently take 300mg Wellbutrin XL, as well as a low dose (10mg) of Ritalin as and when needed. I also struggle with depression, hence the Wellbutrin instead of Vyvanse. 

I'm an academic ghostwriter (which is exactly what it sounds like). I hate it. I haven't had a solid off day (I work seven days a week) since the beginning of March. We are expected to be available 24/7 ""even if it is 2 in the morning"" (this is a direct quote) for work, and obviously the academic year is coming to an end, so lots of assignments. I also often get large assignments (6+ pages) which are meant to take a good few days, hours before they are due. It's ridiculously stressful. Last week, I did 5x lengthy assignments in 2 days. 

Obviously, this job is not the dream. Jobs in the field I studied s are few and far between, largely based on nepotism, and not being advertised anywhere I can find. There's also a recession. And a major youth unemployment crisis in my country. I cannot quit this stupid ghostwriting job because I have no other options. My last formal employment ended at the beginning of August last year. I write application after application for anything I'm vaguely qualified for, to no avail, and often no reply. Or worse, sometimes after several rounds of interviews, ""we've deciding to put the hiring for this job on hold."" (This particular scenario has happened to me 4 times during this job search.) 

These circumstances can't be fixed with medication, I'm aware. There's no pill that's suddenly going to give me a decently paying job in my field with normal hours. However, I just feel like I'm struggling with everything else, and my medication isn't helping. 

If I have a longer deadline for a work assignment (eg it's due on Wednesday morning and I receive it on Tuesday night), I procrastinate until the last possible second I can begin the project, because I do not want to do it lol. I'm burnt out. This obviously causes extreme stress, as we are not to be late on deadlines under any circumstances. 

When I have a break, I'm too tired to even begin to think of reopening my laptop to trawl LinkedIn. Each job application means customising my CV specifically to the job, writing the world's most persuasive cover letter for no one to read, and often also filling in additional information on the company's website because I have to submit my application through some portal. I also procrastinate these when I have time, as I've developed a kind of mental block about them, as I associate them with either mild disappointment (no response) or extreme disappointment (rejection after several rounds of interviews). This does me no favours in the job market. The academic year is also ending (as I previously said), so I need to find something different STAT, but I am so inundated with work that I have no time. 

I'm also expected to fit in making plans with friends. In university, I was incredibly social, I loved being with my friends and going out and partying, we were all in the same course so it wasn't hard to balance this with my university workload and university job. Now, all my friends are scattered, I also have friends form high school that I need to see, and new friendships that I need to cultivate and maintain since I moved to a different city after graduation. I keep forgetting or procrastinating messaging them, and making plans feels like an actual labour of Hercules. This means I'm a bad and flaky friend, which adds guilt to the equation, which makes me want to procrastinate even more. I also don't look forward to going out, as I'm so tired that everything is overwhelming, and socialising and making new friends is starting to stress me out, because my self confidence has also taken a massive dip. 

I keep getting irrationally angry at my phone and silently begging people to leave me alone, when the message is my old roommate asking if I'm free for coffee tomorrow, or something equally innocuous. 

I'm an extrovert, I love being around people, and being around people recharges my batteries. I know I get weird when I'm alone for too long. But I can't handle the pressure of being around people right now. 

I'm even struggling with basic household tasks, like doing the laundry. My partner does martial arts twice a week, and I need to make sure that his martial arts clothing is washed and ready for him for each class (he does the brunt of the housework, so the tradeoff was I deal with cooking, grocery shopping, and the laundry). I can't tell you how many times I've forgotten to do the laundry, and then it's either a big scramble and he has to wear damp clothes, or he wears dirty clothes. I've asked him to please remind me, but that also feels mean. I feel like the husband who weaponises his incompetance to turn his chore into his spouse's problem. 

I'm trying to reconnect with my spirituality (I'm being vague here as I don't like to talk about this) by doing a little prayer/ritual every night before bed for the rest of the year. This is a practise that I did two years ago, and it brought me a lot of comfort. It literally only takes 5 minutes, but I procrastinate it so badly, or forget because I'm tired or distracted or whatever, and I feel guilty and stupid. It shouldn't be this hard to build a routine. 

I enlisted the help of an ADHD life coach back in February, but I keep forgetting to make appointments, and the last time I saw her was in March, because I either don't have time (work), or when I do, I procrastinate doing anything and then it's too late to book a session. 

I love clothing and beauty, its always been my thing, but lately I have no energy even to pick out an outfit in the morning, as its too overwhelming. It shouldn't be overwhelming. I'm also feeling shitty about my body, since I'm not nearly as active as I was in university, and I really struggle to make time to exercise, which I think adds to this. 

I think I'm severely burnt out. It shouldn't be this difficult to balance a job, job applications, replying to messages and basic household tasks. I feel like a total failure to launch, as I imagined my life post-university as exciting and fun, and making new friends while I try to establish myself in my industry. I haven't been able to do any of that. I can't even do the laundry. I feel like a failure as a person. 

I feel like I'd be able to manage my life so much better if my ADHD was manageable. When I first went on Wellbutrin, it was like a magic bullet. After about a year, traumatic circumstances made it less effective, so we upped my dose to 300mg, which I'm currently on. My psychiatrist is unwilling to up it more without some kind of anti-anxiety medication, which I emphatically do not want to go on, as I'm very wary of the side effects of SSRIs. 

I'm so tired. I'm overwhelmed. I can't stop procrastinating literally everything. I hate it lol

1klr47i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1klr47i/how_does_delonghi_magnifica_start_espresso/,How does De'Longhi Magnifica Start espresso machine perform in an honest review?,"Using the De'Longhi ECAM22022SB Magnifica Start Automatic Espresso & Coffee Machine has been an interesting adventure for someone like me, who indulges in coffee daily. For a coffee enthusiast, this machine promises a lot, from its one-touch recipes to the manual milk frother, and I’ve delved deeply into each feature to understand its full potential.

**Sleek and Compact Design**

The first thing that caught my eye was its silver finish and compact structure, which fits perfectly on counters without occupying much space. The machine measures 17"" in depth, 9.25"" in width, and 14"" in height, making it great for even smaller kitchens like mine. Its modern aesthetic coupled with intuitive button placement ensures that the machine doesn’t just look good, but is surprisingly user-friendly.

**Versatile Coffee Options**

One of the essential elements for any espresso machine is its variety, and this device excels with its three preset recipes: Espresso, Coffee, and Americano. From my experience, each has a balanced flavor and strength. While I typically enjoy a strong Americano in the mornings, I appreciate the flexibility of adjusting intensity levels for others in my home, who prefer milder coffees. It's worth noting that crafting specialty drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos became effortless, thanks to the manual milk frother.

**[Check De'Longhi ECAM22022SB price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cwchhdk5/)**  

**Impressive Built-in Grinder**

Featuring a 13-setting conical burr grinder, the freshness of each cup is undeniable. I tested this feature with different coffee beans, and the consistent grind guaranteed a rich aroma every time. However, for those unfamiliar with grinders, there’s a slight learning curve. I experimented with the coarseness settings before finding one that consistently met my preferences. Its efficiency in dose preparation makes this feature incredibly valuable for those like me who crave fresh coffee.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**

This machine stands out in terms of user-friendliness. The one-touch display panel simplifies the process of crafting a perfect cup. Within minutes of unboxing, I had it set up and brewed my first espresso. When it comes to maintenance, the removable, dishwasher-safe components are a lifesaver for someone like me who despises tedious cleaning. The auto-clean function is another brilliant addition, minimizing manual effort.

**Good Points**

- The compact design fits into tight spaces without any hassle.  
- Multiple grind settings ensure fresh, customized coffee.  
- The auto-clean feature reduces maintenance time significantly.  

**Areas for Improvement**

Although the device has mostly impressed me, there are certain drawbacks worth mentioning:  

- The dark tint of the water tank makes monitoring water levels a challenge.  
- If it runs out of water mid-brew, the machine doesn’t resume the process after refilling.  
- The manual frother adds effort; an automatic option could have been more convenient.  

**Competitive Options**

Comparing this model to counterparts such as the Breville Bambino Plus or the Phillips 3200 Series, a few notable contrasts emerge. The Magnifica offers slightly fewer customization options compared to the Breville, which provides micro-foam milk texturing but at a significantly higher price point. On the other hand, although the Phillips 3200 Series includes an automatic milk frother, it tends to fall short on the boldness of espresso flavor compared to the ECAM22022SB. The Magnifica uniquely balances quality and ease, particularly for households that value simplicity coupled with excellent coffee results.

**Value Proposition**

In terms of its value for the price, the device undeniably offers a commendable variety of features—especially the built-in grinder and its customization for strength and grind levels. Many of its competitors sit at a higher price point while providing comparable functionality. Whether you’re a first-time buyer or an espresso aficionado, this product feels like a wise investment for its versatility and precision.

I also packed additional warm layers (fleece and pants) since my train got delayed and it was chilly, but ended up shipping them home from McKeesport in a flat-rate box on Saturday since they didn’t quite fit in my bag. I’m considering adding another bag for future fall trips when cold weather is more frequent. No plans to do any actual camping yet, so minimal is still the preferred setup.

I drove up to Cumberland, MD on Friday and left my car in the lot under the highway near 292 South Mechanic Street (a location recommended in another post). No issues there. Plenty of other cars parked overnight, a lot of them with bike racks. Seems like a common place to leave your vehicle.

My train to Pittsburgh was scheduled for 7:25 p.m. but ended up delayed until around 12:15 a.m., with no clear weather-related reason. That put me into Pittsburgh at about 4:00 a.m. I passed the time in Cumberland by attending a local theater production of Little Women, because why not. Stayed at the Wyndham Grand in downtown Pittsburgh for about $150, which was the cheapest hotel I could find when I booked it. Got to sleep around 5:30 a.m. and woke up at 10:30am. Yes, I was tired.

Day 1 – Pittsburgh -> Rockwood (105 miles)

After a quick Starbucks run for coffee and breakfast, I hit the trail around 11:30 a.m. The weather was gorgeous. I loved how the first part of the trail felt more urban than the C&O (which I rode a few weeks earlier). I can see why people say the GAP is both easier terrain-wise and more diverse scenically than the C&O. There’s also more elevation gain than on the C&O (which is basically flat), but the crushed limestone surface here led me to feel like I was moving noticeably faster on the flat stretches than on similarly-graded segments of the C&O.

Aside from the post office in McKeesport, I also stopped at Yough River brewery in Connellsville, which had some solid NEIPAs and sours.  It’s about 1.5 miles off trail, but very worth it in my opinion.  

At one point, some cows had gotten onto the trail, forcing everyone to move to the side, which was an amusing near-stampede experience.

I also made a quick drink stop in Ohiopyle as well, at a bar right off the trail.  If you want to make a solid drinking trip out of the GAP, I can report that this is definitely an option (though I was pretty tame for my part…I skipped other adult beverage opportunities).

I arrived in Rockwood later than expected due to me slowing down in the evening along with a couple gear mishaps. Both my headlight and taillight died after only 2 hours of riding, and it’s probably time to replace them (they're 10 years old, so the chargeable batteries are likely giving out). I usually carry a backup backpacking headlamp but didn’t this time, and I was kicking myself. Ended up navigating a stretch with a jerry-rigged iPhone flashlight, which was not ideal.

Luckily, the Hostel on Main in Rockwood was empty aside from me, so I didn’t feel weird/embarrassed arriving after lights-out (11pm). I highly recommend that hostel by the way: $38 for a bed, sheets, and shower, and the owner Judy was super communicative. I didn’t make it to Trailhead Brewery in town, so I’ll need to hit that next time.

Day 2 (45 miles) was a quicker ride, with fewer stops between Rockwood and Cumberland.  You can make a quick breakfast out of things at the Dollar General near the trail (I chugged most of a 52 oz Fairlife milk jug... questionable, but no ill consequences). The last 22 miles are a continuous downhill where I was coasting stretches at 18 mph with little perceived effort. This was a really fun way to end the ride, and made me guess that Pittsburgh -> Cumberland might be the preferred direction (though getting all the climbing out of the way up front on fresh legs might be an argument for the opposite).

Trail conditions are excellent right now, and I hope anyone who is considering the GAP trail is able to take the opportunity to get out there before it gets much warmer. Happy to answer any questions!

Edit: one thing I would also mention is that there were a few sections where it helped to have the AllTrails map downloaded for this trail.  The GAP is easy enough to navigate by and large but can still lead you off-course if you're not paying attention (looking at you, McKeesport).  Versus the C&O which is basically idiot-proof since it follows the canal.",12,1747155304.0,gaptrail,2,1.0,False

I hope you like it and that it's more understandable. English isn't my primary language, but I do what I can.\]  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The first to notice when they entered our solar system was the BRICS space station on the moon, led by the superpower Brazil, which took over the world economy after the disaster of the Third World War, where the former great superpowers destroyed each other, supported by the countries of the region that joined the bloc.  
The state-of-the-art telescopes pointed at Neptune were obscured by enormous spacecraft, too massive to be of the exploration type.  
""What the hell?"" Chief Scientist Thaigo said as he looked at the 3D projection in the middle of the command room. ""How long have those ships been orbiting Neptune?"" – I asked a small woman who was around 30 years old – They must have appeared in the last twelve hours Thaigo, yesterday they were not in that place at this time – Said the woman as she approached with a cup of coffee and handed it to the man – Tell me Isabel, do you think they will come in peace? – Said the captain as he took the cup and took a sip – Don't talk nonsense Thaigo, we know very well that when a more advanced civilization arrives it is not with the idea of ​​being friendly, history has taught us that – Said Isabel while she had her gaze lost watching the ships floating – By the way, the heads of state want to have an emergency meeting – she continued as she took out a digital tablet and handed it to Thaigo – Have you already informed them “Cholita”? – He asked with a face of discomfort and she responded with a mischievous smile and left the command room. In the middle of the room, a screen appears, descending from the ceiling, causing the 3D projection to disappear, and a ringtone begins to sound. Thaigo scratches his head and accepts the call from his tablet.  
On the monitor, four people appear, representing the most important regions of the Americas. The Central Mexican Union, the Caribbean Commonwealth, the Bolivia-Chile-Argentina Trinity, and Greater Brazil, all with serious faces, looking at Thaigo. The union representative breaks the silence and is the first to speak. “I hope this is a joke. The Central Mexican Union is very busy messing around with those creeps from the north who want to leave the exclusion zone.” Thaigo sighed and spoke. “Gentlemen, you honor me with this call, but I don’t think this is a waste of time.” Thaigo looked at the tablet, pressing the screen. Immediately, the four of them received a notification. “We don’t know when, but a fleet of unknown origin appeared in Neptune’s orbit. They haven’t moved for the last three hours that we’ve been observing them.” He let out a tired sigh that the representatives saw and continued. “But what we can assure you is that what is discussed in this room will decide the future of this worn-out land.” ◦◦◦  
  
“Ms. Isabel,” says a young man in his twenties wearing a military-style uniform with the BRICS flag embroidered on the side. “One of the objects orbiting Neptune has begun to accelerate towards Earth. Calculations show it’s heading for the Southern Hemisphere.” Isabel, who had been reading a book with the name Hopscotch on the cover, leaves the worn object on her desk and heads towards the officer’s screen. “Those bastards have finally made their move,” she commented, clenching her fist tightly and one eye trembling. “Keep monitoring. I’ll go tell Thaigo.” She then took the young man’s shoulder, pushing herself out of the room. With great difficulty, Isabel walked through the hallways of that gray and claustrophobic facility. Each step she took felt heavier and slower until she stumbled and fell, almost losing consciousness. “Isabel! Are you okay?” – Was heard in the background in one of the hallways as a man with a dark complexion and an athletic build approached her. “Have you gone without food before?” said the man, who was around 40 years old. “I’m sorry, Alejandro. It’s because of this whole thing about the damn aliens on Neptune. I was on my way to warn Thaigo.” Alejandro looked at Isabel and put on a stern face. “I was also heading with him. The radio center detected a message coming from Neptune.” Alejandro helped Isabel get up and, leaning on each other, they headed to the control room where Thaigo was.  
◦◦◦  
\- Well, we can't make any other decision Thaigo, the lunar station is a scientific facility but it was voted on by the member and associate nations to transform it into a military grade station, in less than 72 hours Chinese, Russian and Brazilian equipment will be arriving to take control of the station, all civilians who are not of vital importance to the management of the facility will return with their respective heads of state - Said the representative of La Gran Brasil being the last one left in video call connection with Thaigo - We've known each other for many years, so I'll tell you, I know you're enthusiastic about new discoveries but as a friend, take Isabel and return to your home - Then the call is cut off and the screen turns off returning to its place \*Toc-Toc-Toc, is heard at the door and then opens, Isabel and Alejandro enter and go to the sofa where Isabel lies down and Alejandro speaks - Thaigo, this is very bad - Turns to look at the Brazilian man - Isabel tells me that one of the ships began to move towards Earth and I intercepted an encrypted message in a dead language, Hebrew, because of the third great war we lost a lot of information and the little we could decipher was meaningless- Alejandro said as he approached Thaigo – “Save”, “Help”, “Extension” – They are the only thing we could rescue - Thaigo looked at Alejandro with narrowed eyes and said – It no longer concerns us, the space station has passed into the hands of the armed forces, we have to evacuate the facility as soon as the next supply ship arrives - The room fell silent as the three looked at each other.

◦◦◦

In the next hour the announcement that the military forces of the bloc would take control of the station and that all civilians should evacuate was announced through a statement, all security personnel within the station took charge and prepared for the arrival of the armed forces, the supply ship was about to arrive as every third day.

\- Damn, who would have told us that 70 years after the Third Great War we would find, I mean, find us, aliens and that everything would go to shit? - Isabel said while holding her stomach and walking behind Thaigo. - I think it's a terrible time to... - She is interrupted as the boarding door opened. - Come on, Isabel, let's go home. - Thaigo said with trembling hands and guided her through the crowd. - I never understood our foolishness for putting windows on spaceships. - Alejandro said as the three of them settled in front of a window.

The three remained silent. Thaigo and Isabel hugged each other while the others finished boarding.



An alarm signal began to sound in the lunar station while the few armed agents ran here and there. The supply ship hurried its uncoupling, leaving some civilians behind, and they moved away from the spaceship. As the ship moved away from the lunar station, they saw the reason for the alarm: the ship that hours earlier began its advance from Neptune was heading toward the moon. The ship slammed into the lunar station, destroying a large portion of the moon. It continued on its way to Earth, entering the atmosphere. The resistance of this, combined with what seemed like a worn-out ship, helped the invading spacecraft gradually begin to burn and dismantle. It never slowed down and soon reached the Earth's surface, impacting between the Andean mountain range and the Amazon River.

A huge explosion shook the atmosphere, clearing clouds across the entire American continent.

Isabel, open-mouthed, separated from Thaigo and walked slowly toward the window to say, ""That place was Peru.""

Like many of you, I've been looking for a blackjack trainer that *actually* hits the mark. I've dug through the feature requests and common frustrations discussed right here on this sub and built an app aimed at being a serious tool for improvement.

It's called **Blackjack Pro Trainer**, and the focus is on:

* **Deep Rule Customization:** S17/H17, 1-8 decks, DAS, RSA, surrender, penetration estimates – set it up to match real casino conditions.
* **Solid Training Drills:** For basic strategy (with feedback) and card counting (multiple systems, RC/TC).
* **No-Nonsense Interface:** Clean, focused on practice, no distracting fluff.

The prototype is now live and ready for you to test: **Prototype Link:** [`https://studio--blackjack-pro-trainer-7ogru.us-central1.hosted.app`](https://studio--blackjack-pro-trainer-7ogru.us-central1.hosted.app)

**Please, go crazy with it!** Download it, use it, try to break it. Your honest feedback is what I'm looking for:

* Does it have the features you need?
* Is it genuinely useful for practice?
* What's clunky? What's missing?
* How can it be better?

My main goal right now is to get your input to make this app as valuable as possible for the community.

I'm committed to developing this based on your feedback. If you find the prototype promising and appreciate the direction it's heading, and you feel like supporting its ongoing development (server costs, more features, etc.), I've set up a Buy Me a Coffee page. This is **completely optional** and not at all required to test the app or provide feedback – the prototype is free to use.

England,"Update from an earlier post I made about having an investigation about me drinking non-alcoholic beer while working as a carer. For context I drank non-alcoholic beer while working as a carer with a client for a 5 hour visit in a pub. During this time I drank both coffee and water and a selection of nonalcoholic drinks up to 0.5%. I was then suspended for this and now I’m going to a disciplinary hearing (employed by company 6 months).

They have stated the reason being 
·        Serious loss of trust and unprofessional conduct, namely drinking alcohol free beer that could quite easily be mistaken for alcohol, whist in the community with a service user, whist wearing your uniform. Which unsettled the service user and had the potential to damage the companies reputation. 

They have stated that this is a serious misconduct. 

They have defined alcohol as “The habitual drinking of intoxicating liquor by an employee, whereby the employee's ability to
perform his/her duties is impaired or his/her attendance at work is interfered with, or he/she endangers the safety of others"".

What can I say to this? Or should I just try to ask for a termination of mutual consent if possible?

Location: West Virginia 

For context: I (f22) left my abusive partner of four years (m22) back in March and moved to my hometown in a different state with my daughter. (Left Arizona to go to West Virginia). We were not married. I left with consent, he knew fully and helped us leave. 

My ISSUE: When we first left and I broke up with him, I told him I'd send pics of our child and I'd leave him unblocked for emergencies or info about them. However, in the past 50+ days since we left, I've gotten hundreds of texts, calls, and emails from him. He's also sent Amazon gifts and doordashed food and coffee. He texted my other ex boyfriend, he texted my Facebook friends, and he messaged my mom. The contents of these messages range from ""I'll always love you"" to ""I fucking hate you, cunt"" and suicide threats and stuff. He made an Instagram account with my face as the profile picture and my full name in the username, he's made 3 accounts to message me on.. he's followed me on Pinterest, Spotify, anywhere where he can contact me. He also sent me my own nudes when he was angry at me for ignoring him. THEN, last week I get a message from an unknown girl, saying they chatted for two days flirting,  but she became concerned because he told her our child's name, age, the state we live in, and sent pictures of them to her, after only speaking for less than 24 hrs. I saw this as a violation of privacy (nothing of my child is public ANYWHERE, so the fact that he shared all of this is disgusting to me.) 

THE ACTUAL LEGAL QUESTIONS:
Can I legally just block all forms of contact, and deny him access to any video chats or pictures or anything? I also have screenshots of all of his crazy behavior and harassment, (suicide threats, cursing me out, thousands of texts and calls).  Would this help my case if this ever went  to court?

I currently live in Atlanta and go to grad school here, but I grew up in rural Tennessee. I’ve lived most of my life in the south minus the couple of years I lived in Berlin, Germany. The south has never felt like home to me because it’s hard (yes even in Atlanta) to communicate when conversations feel superficial and mundane. Being a little neurodivergent also complicates things because I’ve noticed throughout my life people here are very group-think and not inclusive to others.  
Most of my family here is either dead or I no longer speak to because of how difficult my childhood was. 
It’s been many years, pretty much since I lived in Germany that I felt great going out and walking around the city alone. No anxiety and just good vibes.  Obviously, I’m trying not to romanticize Portland too much but I just wanted to say that the experience that I had truly made me feel less alone and I’m super grateful for that.

(24M) on Bumble recently. Our first date was on we just had coffee. He did most of the talking, kept going on about his treks and trips and stuff. I usually don’t open up much on first dates, so I was just listening, and honestly, I felt really drained afterward.

The next day, we met again. This time was a little better — I opened up more and we had some nice conversations. We even talked about maybe going for drinks or taking a bike ride or something after I got back from my weekend trip home.

While I was away, we were texting on Instagram. He started flirting a bit, and I felt like maybe things were going well — like our vibes were actually matching.

Then after I came back, we planned to meet. And that’s when he started insisting we drink at a hotel room — he said it belonged to his friend. I kept saying, “Let’s just go to a bar or somewhere outside,” but he wouldn’t drop it. He kept saying stuff like, “What’s the fun if you go home after drinking?” He just kept pushing the idea, and I was already tired and not feeling well, so it was just… a lot.

He was just constantly convincing me. It felt like he wouldn’t take a normal hangout as an option. At one point, when it started raining, he randomly suggested we drive to Panchgani. Like… what? Out of nowhere. And I was already not feeling great — I had a bit of a cold, was feeling overwhelmed — and with the way he kept going on and on, I just gave in and said fine, let’s go to the hotel room.

We got to the hotel, and honestly, even though he was the one who pushed for it, I ended up paying — ₹1500 for the room and most of the drinks too. It already felt a bit off, but I let it go. We sat down, put on a movie, and started getting close. We kissed, and I felt that tension, that heat. Then he asked me to take off my t-shirt. I said no. He didn’t push right away, but during the makeout, he started touching me more. He took off his own shirt, and somewhere in the moment, I kissed him back.

But even then, I told him — clearly — that I didn’t want to go any further. I even turned away from him, thinking that would be enough of a signal. But he still reached around, unhooked my bra, and slipped his hand inside my shirt. And yes — I was turned on too — I won’t lie about that. But even in that state, I kept saying “no,” “I don’t want to,” “please stop.” It wasn’t just hesitation. I meant it.

Then he took off his pants. I told him again, “Yaar, I don’t want to do this.” He didn’t respond — just acted like he didn’t hear me. He asked for a blowjob after, and when I refused, he tried bringing himself close to my mouth — I turned away quickly. He got on top of me, started kissing me again, and tried to pull down my pants. I tried to push him away, said “please don’t.” He looked at me and said, “Just let me remove it, I won’t do anything.” But he did.

He took them off. Then kissed me again, wore a condom, and had sex with me. I told him it was hurting — it really was — and I said again, “I don’t want to do this.” He just said, “It’s your first time, it’s supposed to hurt”

He finished in a few minutes. I felt frozen. He went to the bathroom. I lay there crying, facing the other side of the bed. He didn’t ask if I was okay. Just started watching TV. Later I tried to rest my head on his chest — hoping for some emotional comfort — but he barely responded. We slept next to each other. No cuddling, no warmth. In the morning, I cuddled up to him again, and he stroked my head for a bit, but it didn’t feel like care. It felt empty.

Now I’m left feeling shattered. Used. Dirty. And yet, some part of me is still craving care, love, affection. Why do I even feel that way toward someone who hurt me?

I’ve had something similar happen in the past — trusted a guy from Bumble too fast, ended up losing my virginity that way. Although that guy was decent, we dated for a while. But now, I feel like every time I trust someone or want love, it ends in sex and emotional emptiness. Maybe I don’t know how to say no. Maybe men can sense that.

TLDR

Bumble date kept pressuring me to go to a hotel instead of out. I said no to sex multiple times, but he ignored me and did it anyway. I feel violated, hurt, and emotionally numb. I just wanted love, but I feel used.",3,1747154933.0,RelationshipIndia,32,0.8,False

**Let's Divorce**

The night before their third wedding anniversary, Cary Gibson emerged victorious from a high-end auction, securing a pair of rare sapphire earrings.  
  
He said softly, ""This is for the person I owe the most--my beloved.""  
  
From home, his wife, Evelina Marsh, felt tears pooling as she watched the auction on television. Tomorrow was their third anniversary, and maybe, at long last, Cary had realized her devotion.  
  
Cary's grandmother, Demi Gibson, exhaled in quiet satisfaction. ""At long last, Cary's learned how valuable his wife truly is.""  
  
The next evening, Evelina had barely set the finishing touches on an extravagant dinner when Cary stepped through the door.  
  
She hurried to greet him, swiftly taking his briefcase before reaching out for his coat.  
  
""Quite a feast tonight,"" he said lightly. ""Did something happen?""  
  
Tall and captivating, Cary carried himself effortlessly. Even the simple act of loosening his tie appeared like a polished gesture from a high-fashion shoot.  
  
Yet, somehow, he always managed to chill Evelina with just a few words. Her fingers paused uncertainly, and she quietly said, ""You didn't forget, did you?""  
  
No, that couldn't be right. He had purchased those priceless sapphire earrings to make amends, hadn't he?  
  
Cary's eyebrows knitted together slightly. ""Forget what exactly, Evelina?""  
  
""The sapphire earrings... you bought them, didn't you?"" Her heart trembled with unease, but hope stubbornly remained.  
  
""How do you know about those earrings?"" Cary appeared genuinely startled. He clearly didn't expect his mild-mannered, invisible wife to keep tabs on such extravagant things.  
  
A faint smirk tugged at his lips, hinting at contempt.  
  
Certainly, Evelina possessed natural beauty--gentle features, eyes soft and expressive--but she refused to flaunt it. She dressed plainly, appearing perpetually dull and overlooked, like a flower that had ceased to bloom.  
  
Even the Gibson household maid seemed more refined than Evelina.  
  
Yet, Evelina gathered her courage, eyes shining cautiously. ""I saw the auction broadcast. Those earrings are really lovely--""  
  
Cary interjected her abruptly, ""They're for Esme.""  
  
At the mere mention of his first love, Esme Barton, Cary's voice softened noticeably. ""She's finally agreed to return to me. Naturally, I needed something special to welcome her back.""  
  
Evelina felt her chest tighten painfully, her breath hitching.  
  
So, the one he felt indebted to was Esme Barton, the very woman who had abandoned him?  
  
And what did that make her--the devoted wife who had stood beside him for three years without complaint, never even asking for recognition?  
  
Unable to bear it, Evelina's voice wavered with hurt. ""Cary, have you forgotten whose fault the accident was--the one that blinded you?""  
  
On that terrible day, Esme had thrown a tantrum over something insignificant, distracting Cary and causing him to crash.  
  
When news broke that Cary's sight was likely permanently lost, Esme swiftly disappeared, crafting a flimsy excuse before fleeing overseas the same day. She left no trace, vanishing completely.  
  
Their wedding had already been announced, invitations sent. Neither Esme nor her family could be located.  
  
If Evelina hadn't courageously stepped in at the final hour, the Gibson family would've been the scandalous gossip of the whole city.  
  
""You know nothing about it!"" Cary retorted harshly. ""Esme wasn't to blame!""  
  
He refused to tolerate any criticism directed at his so-called true love. ""Esme arranged the surgeries for my eyes,"" he replied defensively. ""If someone hadn't accidentally revealed the truth, I would never have known everything she secretly did for me.""  
  
Stunned, Evelina could barely form words. ""What... are you saying?""  
  
It was Evelina herself who performed his surgeries. His grandmother had practically begged her for help. She had conducted three critical procedures, pushing herself to exhaustion. Countless sleepless nights she spent tending to him, never revealing she was the renowned Sight Weaver, devoting herself entirely to Cary.  
  
How had Esme ended up with all the credit?  
  
""Are you certain? You trust every rumor you hear?""  
  
""Absolutely. Esme was Professor Landen Mitchell's last apprentice--the only person on Earth qualified to perform those surgeries,"" Cary responded with unwavering pride and gratitude.  
  
But wasn't Evelina actually Professor Mitchell's final apprentice? How long had Esme been pretending to be her?  
  
Evelina desperately wanted to expose Esme's deception right then and there, but she quickly recalled her mentor's death six months earlier.  
  
Of course, Esme would choose now to make her return.  
  
With Landen gone, no one could challenge Esme's claims. And Cary, fully healed through Evelina's care, now held significant influence as head of the Gibson Group. Esme's timing was impeccably strategic.  
  
Evelina had no evidence, no way to reveal the truth. Quietly, bitterly, she asked, ""Then what are you even doing here tonight? Shouldn't you be celebrating with Esme?""  
  
Removing her apron abruptly, Evelina felt despair gnawing painfully at her heart.  
  
Cary's answer was casual and indifferent. ""I'm exhausted, Evelina. Let's end this marriage. We agreed on three years, and I've endured it long enough.""  
  
Endured it long enough? How dare he casually dismiss all her sacrifices?  
  
Three long years she'd sacrificed, pouring everything she had into nursing him back from blindness, making him the powerful man he had become.  
  
Without even acknowledging the anguish on her face, Cary calmly took out a set of divorce documents, obviously prepared ahead of time. ""Review them. If you have no objections, sign. I've wasted enough time already. I won't make Esme wait anymore.""  
  
Glancing over the papers, Evelina focused bitterly on the divorce settlement--an apartment far from the city center, the worn-out car she'd driven for groceries, and a mere three million dollars.  
  
Incredible. His audacity was astonishing.  
  
He'd gifted sapphire earrings worth three hundred million to the woman responsible for his blindness, yet offered a paltry three million to the wife who had saved him.  
  
Three million wouldn't even cover the cost of one of her surgeries, let alone make up for the countless procedures she had rejected during these three years spent hidden away, caring only for him.  
  
""If you want more..."" Cary anticipated tears or pleading from Evelina.  
  
Instead, she scoffed softly, picked up the pen decisively, and signed her name with determination.  
  
Cary faltered, bewildered. He hadn't expected her to surrender so quickly. Evelina was an orphan--would she really walk away from a life of comfort?  
  
Handing back the signed papers, Evelina said coldly and clearly, ""It's done. But Cary, you'd better not regret your choice.""  
  
  
Chapter 2 The Queen Returns  
Momentarily startled, Cary recovered quickly. ""Of course I won't regret this. But since you accepted the settlement, it's your responsibility to explain the divorce to Grandma.""  
  
Cary knew perfectly well that Demi only recognized Evelina as her true granddaughter-in-law. If news of their divorce reached her ears, he'd face her wrath.  
  
And naturally, Cary expected Evelina to shoulder the blame.  
  
Without raising her gaze, Evelina calmly replied, ""I'm not explaining anything to her. In these past three years, I've settled my debt with Demi in full. Aren't you madly in love with Esme? What's wrong--can't even muster enough courage to face your own grandmother?""  
  
Growing up in an orphanage, Evelina owed her education entirely to Demi's generosity.  
  
So when the Gibson family urgently needed a substitute bride, she'd readily stepped in.  
  
She didn't flinch when Cary lost his vision. Instead, she fulfilled her duties faithfully, cared tirelessly for him, and managed the household without complaint.  
  
She had one modest request--a three-year trial. If Cary failed to fall in love with her by the end, they'd peacefully part ways.  
  
Now, finally, her freedom had arrived.  
  
""True love conquers everything,"" Evelina replied dryly, sarcasm lightly coating her words. ""I genuinely hope your perfect fairytale lasts forever.""  
  
Reaching for her car keys, she found her path abruptly blocked by Margot Gibson, Cary's younger sister.  
  
""Evelina, I heard you're divorcing my brother. That car is Gibson family property--you can't take it!""  
  
Evelina laughed coldly. ""I paid for this car myself. Honestly, Margot, you're just as brazen as Cary.""  
  
Drawn by the commotion, Cary stepped forward. ""What's happening here?""  
  
Immediately, Margot complained petulantly, saying, ""Cary, Evelina is taking the car, and I was planning to use it!""  
  
His brow creased slightly. ""Evelina, hand over the keys to Margot.""  
  
""Absolutely not,"" she replied coldly. ""Why should I?""  
  
""You're unbelievable!"" Margot lunged forward to grab the keys.  
  
Suddenly, an old suitcase flew into the vehicle, followed swiftly by several lit firecrackers.  
  
In moments, sparks flew and thick smoke billowed as the firecrackers erupted, sending Margot shrieking in panic.  
  
""The car is yours--I don't want it,"" Evelina responded coolly, brushing off her hands as she turned decisively away.  
  
Everything she'd used or worn in the Gibson household would remain. She wanted nothing to remind her of this place.  
  
She quickly dialed her closest friend, Kristina Anderson.  
  
As Evelina reached the villa gates, a sleek, understated luxury car awaited her.  
  
Kristina's jaw dropped dramatically. ""Well, if it isn't the real Queen Evelina herself!""  
  
Feigning astonishment, Kristina rubbed her eyes. ""Three years, Evelina. Every call I've made, you were too preoccupied tending to that ungrateful husband. I honestly couldn't tell whether I'd attended your wedding or your funeral back then.""  
  
Leaping forward, Kristina embraced Evelina tightly. ""Finally done with that 'blind' fool? Good. Now we start living for real.""  
  
Kristina snapped her fingers theatrically. ""Wait, no--I need to stock up on fireworks! Your grand return demands a proper celebration.""  
  
""You're too late,"" Evelina said coolly, gesturing casually over her shoulder.  
  
Just then, an explosive bang split the peaceful night. The old car erupted spectacularly into flames.  
  
Sparks scattered brilliantly, lighting up the darkness in a vivid display.  
  
""How's that for a farewell gift?"" Evelina asked with a playful grin, her eyebrow arched mischievously.  
  
Kristina erupted into laughter. ""There she is! Queen Evelina is finally back! Time to party!""  
  
Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelina gave an exhausted sigh. ""Another day, perhaps. I just desperately need sleep.""  
  
She had spent the last three years caring tirelessly for Cary's recovery, barely managing to rest properly. Fatigue weighed heavily on her now.  
  
Inside the villa, Margot was stamping her foot furiously.  
  
""She nearly scared me to death! Has Evelina lost her mind? She destroyed our car! Cary, you have to do something about her--""  
  
""That's enough!"" Cary interrupted sharply.  
  
Exasperation lined his voice as he scolded, ""Is this childish tantrum how a Gibson should behave?""  
  
Margot quickly shifted to a pleading, wounded tone, saying, ""Are you actually scolding me over that woman? Wait until I tell Esme--she'll see how much you've changed!""  
  
""Don't talk nonsense,"" Cary retorted irritably, though privately dismissing Evelina as insignificant compared to his sister.  
  
He quickly softened his voice to reassure her. ""Have you forgotten Jasper Russell is arriving in Aglonard soon?""  
  
The Russell family, among Ireah's most influential families, dominated politics, business, and military circles, making them untouchably powerful.  
  
And Jasper Russell, their youngest heir, wasn't only extraordinarily charismatic but also managed the immense Russell Group. His slightest gesture sent ripples across high society.  
  
Most importantly, he was the only bachelor among the Russell heirs. Every wealthy young woman in Aglonard and beyond fantasized about becoming Mrs. Russell.  
  
""I haven't forgotten,"" Margot murmured shyly, blushing deeply at the mention of her admired figure.  
  
She clung affectionately to Cary's arm, adding eagerly, ""He's visiting for his niece's eye treatment. If Esme successfully heals Miss Florrie Russell's eyesight, she'll become indispensable to the Russell family--and undeniably valuable to us. Even Grandma will have to accept her then.""  
  
Cary gave a thoughtful nod.  
  
Esme's supposed medical talent had drawn the Russells to Aglonard, presenting them with a perfect opportunity to solidify powerful alliances.  
  
""And if you assist Esme during the operation and gain Miss Russell's favor... perhaps Jasper himself will notice you,"" he suggested encouragingly.  
  
""Oh, thank you, Cary!"" Margot's eyes sparkled as dreams filled her head.  
  
But Cary's thoughts wandered unexpectedly. The image of Evelina striding confidently away, fearless and poised, lingered stubbornly.  
  
He had dismissed her as plain, passive, even boring. This daring, fierce version of her was entirely unexpected.  
  
Perhaps... he needed to reassess the woman he'd overlooked for three years.  
  
  
Chapter 3 The Wife Versus The Homewrecker  
Evelina spent three uninterrupted days catching up on sleep in Kristina's luxurious presidential suite.  
  
Aside from brief intervals of nibbling on snacks, she barely moved, with Kristina even applying rejuvenating face masks for her.  
  
On the fourth morning, Demi called unexpectedly, requesting Evelina's presence at the Gibson Mansion.  
  
It wasn't difficult to guess the reason behind the call--no doubt it concerned the divorce.  
  
Kristina, however, suspected something deeper.  
  
She said, ""I doubt it's that simple. Apparently, Florrie Russell, the eldest granddaughter of the influential Russell family, recently went blind after suffering a severe head injury. The family has exhausted their options with renowned specialists and is now desperately seeking Landen Mitchell's elusive protege--the Sight Weaver.  
  
Jasper Russell himself is arriving in Aglonard to oversee the search personally. Demi is the only one aware of your true identity, and I'm concerned she might try to--""  
  
Evelina quickly reassured her. ""Demi vowed never to expose my identity. Don't worry.""  
  
Kristina remained cautious. ""Just make sure the Gibson family don't take advantage of your skills again.""  
  
""I'll be careful,"" Evelina replied firmly.  
  
Still unconvinced, Kristina said decisively, ""You won't be meeting them looking like this.""  
  
Immediately after breakfast, Kristina summoned her private beauty team. ""Your mission: revive our sleeping beauty.""  
  
And they did. After ample rest, Evelina resembled a wilting flower that had finally received sunlight. Her skin was luminous, her features radiant, and the tiredness that had dimmed her gaze for years completely disappeared, replaced by clarity and allure.  
  
With a refined cocktail dress and minimal yet tasteful makeup, Evelina transformed dramatically.  
  
Kristina stood speechless for several moments before exclaiming, ""Cary must've been utterly blind to trade a goddess for someone like Esme.""  
  
Precisely on time, the Gibson family's chauffeur-driven vehicle arrived outside the hotel.  
  
Asher, the family's longtime butler, personally came to escort her. Initially, he didn't recognize Evelina at all.  
  
He stared uncertainly until she greeted him, causing recognition to dawn suddenly. ""Ms. Marsh?"" He stumbled over his words. ""You look absolutely extraordinary.""  
  
Within half an hour, the car pulled up at the Gibson Mansion, with Asher quickly stepping out to courteously open her door.  
  
""Is this Miss Russell herself?"" Margot hurried forward, her expression instantly switching to flattery.  
  
Today marked Jasper's arrival, and Margot had meticulously styled herself since early morning, eager to capture his attention.  
  
She figured it would just be Jasper showing up. The last thing she expected was a stunning woman standing at the door.  
  
With that grace and confidence, who else could she be but a Russell?  
  
""Margot, perhaps you should get your eyes checked."" Evelina's tone was polite, edged with unmistakable disdain.  
  
Margot's mouth dropped open. ""It's you?"" she whispered incredulously, jealousy flaring visibly as she examined Evelina closely.  
  
At that precise moment, another vehicle approached. Cary stepped out gracefully, accompanied by Esme.  
  
Yet when his gaze landed upon Evelina, he stopped abruptly, utterly captivated.  
  
Just a few days had passed--how had she transformed so stunningly? Evelina radiated an effortless, compelling beauty.  
  
Noticing Cary's astonishment, Esme's jaw tightened, though she maintained her gentle smile. ""That's your ex-wife, isn't it?"" she said softly. ""Since we've run into her, you might as well say hello. It must have been challenging for an orphan like her to follow you all this way.""  
  
Esme spoke softly, but each word stung sharper than a slap--acting as if she, not Evelina, was the genuine Mrs. Gibson.  
  
Startled out of her reverie, Margot immediately exploded in anger. ""Evelina! Where did you get the money to dress up like this? Did you drain Cary's accounts for your new face and that designer dress?""  
  
Even Esme had opted for simplicity today, avoiding unnecessary attention. Seeing Evelina effortlessly steal the spotlight was unbearable for Margot.  
  
She hesitated briefly before hissing spitefully, ""Look at you, dressed like a tramp. Trying to win Cary back? You're delusional!""  
  
In a rage, Margot lunged forward, claws reaching viciously for Evelina's dress and hair.  
  
Quickly stepping in, Asher intervened firmly, ""Miss Gibson, please! There are esteemed guests today--this isn't appropriate behavior for a Gibson.""  
  
Ignoring Asher's plea, Margot shouted furiously, ""I'll rip that smug face of yours apart!""  
  
Remaining composed, Evelina calmly raised her phone, recording Margot's tantrum. With cold confidence, she replied, ""Keep going. Let's show Jasper Russell exactly how refined you really are.""  
  
Margot froze instantly, eyes wide. Her threats died in her throat, replaced by a scorching glare. ""You wouldn't dare!""  
  
Switching tactics, Margot theatrically leaned against Esme, feigning vulnerability. ""Esme, please protect me. We'll be family soon--you have to defend me.""  
  
She emphasized ""family"" deliberately, aiming to needle Evelina.  
  
Tenderly, Esme stroked Margot's hair as if comforting a child. ""It's alright. Nobody will harm you as long as I'm here.""  
  
Evelina scoffed sharply, ""Where are Demi and Elora Gibson? Since when do outsiders dictate rules in this house?""  
  
Esme's expression turned rigid.  
  
This wasn't the gentle Evelina they all expected. How had she developed such an unexpectedly sharp tongue?  
  
Margot quickly retorted, ""Who's the outsider? You're the one who doesn't belong here!"" Turning to Cary, she said, ""Did you hear what she said to Esme? You can't let her bully us like that!""  
  
With practiced grace, Esme sighed softly. ""It's okay. Evelina didn't have parents to teach her manners--it's not her fault. Cary, please don't blame her.""  
  
Evelina rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by Esme's implication.  
  
Yet Cary saw none of Evelina's frustration. In his eyes, Esme's gentle tolerance only amplified her perfection.  
  
Stepping protectively toward Esme, Cary embraced her tenderly before turning coldly to Evelina. His voice was cutting, saying, ""If you think causing trouble will win you points, you're mistaken. It's pathetic. Apologize to Esme right now.""  
  
  
Chapter 4 Demi Takes A Stand  
Without even sparing Cary a glance, Evelina replied curtly, ""Maybe fix your own judgment before trying to lecture me.""  
  
Determined to avoid further nonsense, she brushed past them swiftly, eager not to keep Demi waiting.  
  
""Don't you dare walk away from me!"" Cary's temper flared, readying himself to berate her once more--but his words vanished as his gaze caught her retreating figure.  
  
Her tailored dress embraced her flawless curves perfectly, her hair cascaded effortlessly down her elegant back, accentuating her slender shoulders and defined waist--details he'd somehow overlooked until now.  
  
Every confident step she took radiated strength, poise, and elegance.  
  
Even the mere outline of her form seemed captivating enough to linger in his thoughts indefinitely.  
  
It struck him painfully: this extraordinary woman was about to become his ex-wife, yet he hadn't even touched her once.  
  
Noticing Cary's intense stare, Esme felt a wave of irritation surge through her, and she sharply pushed herself out of his arms, storming away.  
  
Margot immediately panicked, tugging frantically at Cary's sleeve. ""What are you doing, Cary? You've upset Esme, and now she's leaving!""  
  
Cary blinked, momentarily disoriented, and by the time he regained his senses, Margot was already chasing after Esme.  
  
Inside the mansion, Demi sat in solitude, leaning tiredly against her ornate pearwood chair, glancing anxiously toward the entrance every few moments.  
  
Spotting Evelina, she brightened instantly, rising to welcome her affectionately. ""Evi, my dear girl, you've endured so much.""  
  
""Please don't worry yourself, Demi."" Quickly approaching, Evelina gently helped her sit again, kneeling beside her to carefully massage her aching knees. ""The weather is getting chilly--are your joints troubling you again?""  
  
Demi sighed deeply. ""Same old pain, dear. No one eases it like you do; your treatments are irreplaceable.""  
  
""You've treated me like family all these years, Demi. This is the very least I can do in return,"" Evelina replied sincerely.  
  
Her honest kindness only deepened Demi's regret.  
  
""That foolish grandson of mine--blindly letting go of such a gem! He deserves a beating,"" Demi replied softly.  
  
Evelina gave a gentle shake of her head. ""It's alright, Demi.""  
  
Tenderly, Demi pleaded, ""Evi, sweetheart... just once more, can you give Cary another chance--for my sake?""  
  
""I've waited three long years for him to see me. He never did. Another chance wouldn't change anything,"" Evelina answered quietly.  
  
She had offered countless opportunities, but Cary had repeatedly wasted them. It was finally time to let go.  
  
Demi sighed heavily, sorrow evident in her tone. ""Perhaps it's just fate... our family wasn't fortunate enough to hold onto someone like you.""  
  
Her eyes glistened with tears.  
  
Just then, Margot and Esme entered noisily, chattering cheerfully alongside Cary's mother, Elora Gibson.  
  
Demi's temper erupted immediately.  
  
She snatched up a nearby coffee cup and threw it furiously toward Esme's feet.  
  
Fragments of porcelain scattered violently, coffee splattering across Esme's luxurious heels and the delicate fabric of her custom-made gown.  
  
A sharp cry escaped Esme's lips as she stared, utterly horrified. Though appearing deceptively understated, every stitch of her attire was meticulously selected from exclusive boutiques--her dress alone carried a hefty price, deliberately crafted to exude graceful elegance.  
  
Predictably, the Gibson mother-and-daughter pair, notorious for their lack of fashion sense, were oblivious to its true value.  
  
""What was that about, Grandma?"" Cary exclaimed, swiftly stepping forward to shelter Esme once more, flashing a bitter glance toward Demi.  
  
Demi, however, remained fiercely unapologetic. ""How dare you even ask? Without this woman's antics, would you have had your accident? Would you have lost your sight?""  
  
More painful to Demi than Esme abandoning their engagement was the reality that Esme had almost irreversibly ruined Cary's bright future.  
  
Demi had always seen Cary as her greatest pride--Esme hadn't just harmed her grandson, she'd damaged the entire Gibson legacy.  
  
""I've said this countless times,"" Cary responded in exasperation. ""Esme wasn't responsible for that accident. Why can't you trust me?""  
  
His accusing stare shifted pointedly toward Evelina, who was quietly comforting Demi, gently rubbing her back to ease her breathing.  
  
It had to be Evelina causing trouble again--poisoning Demi's mind.  
  
Without restraint, he said sharply, ""Evelina, have you been whispering lies to Grandma, stirring things up behind our backs?""  
  
Seizing the opportunity, Elora, who had always despised Evelina's modest upbringing, immediately spat venomously, saying, ""Of course it's her! That orphan would do anything to cling onto this family. She may act sweet, but beneath the surface, she's utterly despicable!""  
  
Before Evelina had the chance to defend herself, Demi interrupted harshly, ""Enough! Evelina is the granddaughter-in-law I chose personally. Do you dare disrespect her right before my eyes? Are you openly challenging my authority?""  
  
Elora blanched visibly, quickly stammering, ""Demi, I didn't mean--""  
  
Seeing his mother close to tears, Cary intervened protectively, ""Grandma, please stop scolding Mom. Let's just face reality--you simply don't want me to leave Evelina.""  
  
Turning deliberately, he took Esme's hand firmly into his own, fingers intertwined intimately. ""But that's non-negotiable. Esme is the one I love--she is my only future.""  
  
""Excellent. Marvelous. Absolutely perfect,"" Demi responded bitterly, each word dripping with harsh sarcasm. Anger visibly surged through her, shaking her frail body.  
  
Reacting swiftly, Evelina retrieved a vial of heart medication, administering it carefully to Demi.  
  
After a brief pause to regain composure, Demi said with cold certainty, ""Then let me be clear. Divorce Evelina, and you must immediately surrender ten percent of your Gibson shares directly to her. And Esme? She will never set foot inside the Gibson household again while I'm alive.""  
  
Cary's eyes widened in alarm. ""Grandma, you can't mean--""  
  
With fierce authority, Demi's frail hand slammed against her chair's armrest, the sharp noise resonating clearly. ""I've spoken, and my decision is final,"" she replied resolutely. ""Defy me, Cary, and you forfeit your place as a Gibson.""  
  
  
Chapter 5 Imposter  
""Grandma, are you serious? Shares for her?"" Margot immediately protested, indignation coloring her voice. ""She's nobody--just some orphan without parents--""  
  
Margot's rant was swiftly silenced by Demi's piercing glare, causing her to retreat sheepishly, shrinking like a scolded child.  
  
Quiet sobs emerged from Elora. ""Demi, Cary is your own grandson...""  
  
With a dismissive snort, Demi retorted sharply, ""I have more than one grandson. If he insists on chasing love blindly, let's see how deep his pockets run.""  
  
She intended to expose the harsh reality to Cary--if Esme had abandoned him during his blindness, she'd undoubtedly vanish once he was penniless. Esme was trouble incarnate, certainly not the kind of woman who'd stick by him through hardships.  
  
Muscles tense, Cary's jaw tightened noticeably, his temple pulsing with barely contained anger. Directing his resentment at Evelina, he said bitterly, ""Satisfied now?""  
  
Though Evelina was deeply moved by Demi's fierce support, she remained composed, gently supporting the elderly woman to help stabilize her breathing.  
  
Demi battled chronic blood pressure issues, a weak heart, and aching joints sensitive to seasonal changes.  
  
Had Evelina not worried these ungrateful relatives might push Demi toward a heart attack, she would've already walked away.  
  
""Ma'am--Ma'am!""  
  
Abruptly, a flustered servant hurried into the room, gasping for breath. ""Mr. Russell... he's arrived!""  
  
""Bring him in."" Demi straightened quickly, regaining her composure to receive their distinguished guest.  
  
Margot scrambled anxiously, nearly stumbling over herself. ""Mom! Am I perfect? Is my hair okay? Makeup flawless?""  
  
With maternal pride, Elora reassured her daughter warmly. ""You're stunning, sweetheart. Absolutely flawless--"" Her thoughts darkened instantly, wishing fervently Evelina wasn't present.  
  
Sharply pivoting toward Evelina, Elora said, ""We're expecting an important guest. Shouldn't you discreetly leave through the back entrance?""  
  
Still holding Demi gently, Evelina smiled serenely, unfazed. ""Thanks for reminding me. Actually, Cary and I haven't officially divorced yet. Legally speaking, I'm still his wife--a rightful member of this family.""  
  
She cast an indifferent glance toward Esme, still melodramatically crying into Cary's chest. ""But Miss Barton here... she's merely the mistress. Hardly appropriate company to welcome a respected visitor.""  
  
""How dare you!"" Esme gasped, tears streaming theatrically down her cheeks.  
  
Cary immediately stepped forward protectively, his expression stormy. ""Mind your tongue, Evelina! Mr. Russell came specifically for Esme. She's exceptional--the only one skilled enough to restore his niece's eyesight.""  
  
His words halted Demi's departure. Slowly, she turned back, astonishment evident. ""Who did you say could cure blindness?""  
  
""Esme,"" Cary said proudly, his chest puffing with pride. ""Renowned as the Sight Weaver herself. She was personally trained by Professor Landen Mitchell--she even cured me.""  
  
At that moment, Demi finally got it--why Evelina had decided to give up on her grandson.  
  
Honestly, she wouldn't blame her one bit.  
  
""Esme, is this true?"" Demi's tone sharpened dangerously, her eyes narrowing.  
  
Unable to meet Demi's piercing gaze, Esme remained nervously silent.  
  
Yet Cary, unaware, kept lauding Esme's supposed talents, with Elora and Margot eagerly chiming in, elevating her to almost mythical status.  
  
A low, commanding voice smoothly interrupted their exaggerated praise. ""Seems I've arrived at the perfect moment.""  
  
Standing confidently at the end of the hallway was a tall man, his broad shoulders and authoritative aura instantly capturing everyone's attention.  
  
Elora instantly beamed with anticipation. ""Mr. Russell, you're finally here--we've been waiting eagerly!""  
  
Though she'd never personally met Jasper Russell, a single glance at his immaculate attire, particularly the sophisticated handcrafted shoes, confirmed his identity.  
  
Overwhelmed with excitement, Elora practically dragged Margot along as they rushed to welcome him.  
  
Margot, blushing fiercely and visibly nervous, nearly stumbled in her eagerness.  
  
Just as she opened her mouth to greet him, the man strode right past her without acknowledgment, stopping purposefully in front of Esme. ""You're the renowned Sight Weaver?""  
  
Esme felt her pulse quicken painfully.  
  
She was all too aware of the consequences of deceiving someone of Jasper Russell's caliber--there was absolutely no room for error.  
  
""I... I apologize,"" Esme stuttered hastily, desperation evident. ""My dress got stained. I need to change immediately.""  
  
She quickly spun around, eyeing the nearest doorway for escape.  
  
However, Evelina's composed voice stopped her cold. ""Miss Barton, surely you're not running away already? Could it be because you're pretending to be Professor Mitchell's student?""  
  
Evelina's calm accusation sliced through the tension like a sharp knife.  
  
If Esme was set on snatching up a cheating jerk like Cary, she could have him--no one was stopping her.  
  
Yet, shamelessly exploiting her mentor's reputation to climb the social ladder crossed an unforgivable boundary.  
  
""That's nonsense!"" Esme retorted furiously, glaring daggers at Evelina.  
  
Aware all eyes were on her, Esme continued her charade desperately. ""I studied under Professor Mitchell in graduate school, while you were busy playing housewife and folding clothes.""  
  
""Oh?"" Evelina's soft smile was deceptively gentle. ""If that's true, then surely you know how many surgeries Cary underwent to regain his vision?""  
  
She had personally conducted three major surgeries, alongside one subtle corrective procedure she'd never publicly mentioned.  
  
After a hesitant pause, Esme confidently replied, ""Three, obviously. I performed each myself.""  
  
""You're lying."" Demi's voice sliced sharply through the air. ""It was four.""  
  
Esme visibly paled before hastily correcting herself, saying, ""R-right, four! Of course it was four.""  
  
""Make up your mind, Esme--was it three surgeries or four?"" Demi asked coldly, her voice dripping with disdain.

1klqsw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/speakingfever/comments/1klqsw1/if_speaking_english_feels_like_jumping_off_a/,If Speaking English Feels Like Jumping Off a Cliff… Welcome!,"If the idea of speaking English makes your heart race and your palms sweat, you’re not alone. For many learners, starting a conversation in English feels like standing at the edge of a cliff, unsure whether to leap or run back. But the good news? That fear is temporary, and with the right support and tools, anyone can speak English with confidence.

Let’s dive into why that anxiety exists and how an English-speaking course or spoken English classes can help you turn that fear into fluency.

# Why Speaking English Feels Scary

The fear of speaking a new language usually comes from one place: the fear of making mistakes. Whether you’re in a classroom, a meeting, or a coffee shop, the pressure to “sound right” can feel overwhelming. Many people freeze or avoid speaking altogether because they’re afraid of being judged. But perfection is not the goal. Communication is.

That’s why more learners are now enrolling in spoken English language courses and online English speaking classes — not just to improve grammar, but to practice speaking in real-life situations, where small mistakes are seen as learning steps, not failures.

# Build Confidence with Daily Practice

The only way to stop fearing the “cliff” is to keep jumping — but with a safety net. That safety net is consistent speaking practice in a low-pressure environment.

English-speaking course classes give you structured opportunities to speak, listen, and improve every day. Whether it’s a basic spoken English course or an advanced English speaking course, the key to building confidence is repetition and real conversation.

Even if you’re just talking to yourself in the mirror or joining a virtual session, what matters is getting your mouth used to forming English sentences.

# Use the Right Tools for Your Journey

Today, learning to speak English doesn’t mean sitting through boring lectures or memorizing vocabulary you’ll never use. With resources like English conversation courses online, spoken English course online, and English speaking lessons online, you can learn anytime, anywhere — even from your phone.

These tools are designed for learners who feel nervous, especially beginners. They focus on real conversation, simple sentence construction, and useful topics like introducing yourself, asking questions, and handling everyday situations.

And the best part? You don’t have to be fluent to start — you just have to start.

# Everyone Starts Somewhere

It doesn’t matter if you’re taking your first step with a basic English speaking course or brushing up your skills with an English communication class; every learner begins with hesitation. But what separates successful speakers from silent ones is not talent, it’s consistency and courage.

So if speaking English still feels like jumping off a cliff, remember: you're not falling, you're flying.

You’re learning. You’re improving. And every sentence you speak is a step closer to fluency.",1,1747154719.0,speakingfever,0,1.0,False

1klqrm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1klqrm7/my_dads_cottage_is_following_me/,My dad's cottage is following me,"Growing up my dad always talked about his family’s cottage. It was a little lakeside spot in Ontario that my grandpa built when my dad was young. They spent every summer there. Tales of the dogs being goofy and teenage watersport shenanigans were common around our dinner table, but because my dad had moved across the country here to British Columbia after marrying my mom I’d only seen the cottage once as a kid.

I was ten, and some of my memories of the cottage are pretty vivid. It was my first cross country flight, it was a place that had been built up in stories for years, but most of all it was just a fun place for a ten year old. Well most of it was fun. The cottage itself was a bit of a let down, it was small, three cramped bedrooms lined up at the back of the house with a single larger room at the front that housed the kitchen in one corner, the table against the windows at the front, and a little seating area to the side with a shelf of board games and books. My dad and I generally ended our days there with a game or two of cribbage using the old beaten up board he would pull off that shelf. There was a map of the surrounding area hung up on the back wall and a truly terrifying shag rug in the sitting area. The kitchen relied heavily on linoleum. The dining table was a work of art though, built by my grandpa with one of the fallen trees on the property so it was the perfect length for the whole family to have a spot to sit. The cottage had a gently peaked roof and a small stilted porch to keep the whole place level as the lakefront gently sloped down to the water. It was wood paneled all the way around, with an electrical box at the back and a second, burnt silhouette of an electrical box next to it from where the cabin had been struck by lightning back when my dad was in his teens.

That trip was the only time I got to meet my grandpa in person, and even then there were a lot of us there. It was a family reunion, so with my dad’s two brothers, one sister, plus spouses and cousins, there were enough people at the lake that most of us were staying at neighbors’ places nearby. The only moment I got alone with my grandpa we played tic tac toe on a cheap aluminum set that my grandpa had found down the back of the bookshelf. He beat me three times in a row. Not a surprise, I was ten after all. Just like my dad he was a sore winner, and I had a sneaking feeling he would have been an even worse loser, though I didn’t find out on that trip.

But another reason why I have such vivid memories of that trip is because of what happened on the day we were leaving. I was coming up from the water towards the cottage when I saw someone tall and unfamiliar strolling casually around from the back of the house and up towards the front door. Someone I didn’t recognize heading up to the cottage wasn’t weird, it had happened half a dozen times while we were there, neighbors came calling pretty regularly and with so much family in town it might just have been the next distant relation rolling in after us. But two things were strange, even to a ten year old. Firstly, the way the figure walked was odd, springy and leaned-back, like how people look when they walk backwards, except they were walking forwards. And secondly, the figure looked shadowed, like when you’re standing in the sunlight looking at someone in the shade. Just a bit harder to make out details. The odd part was it was the middle of the day, and the figure walked through no shady spots, yet I couldn’t make out their face or exactly where their limbs ended. 

All strange adults are hard to tell apart as a kid, and I was already heading back to the cottage, so I followed it up and through the front door, surprised to find there was nobody inside once I got there. I went through every room of the cottage, checked the closets, checked under the table and the sink. Nobody was in the cottage, maybe for the first time since we had arrived, including the stranger I had just seen enter. It’s a little thing, almost certainly a combination of a child’s imagination and a bit of misremembering, but now I’m not so sure. Now I think it wasn’t a person at all that wandered casually around the back of my dad’s old cottage and disappeared inside of it. 

The important thing to remember is that this cottage existed in Ontario, across the country from where I live. It was built four or five decades before I was even born, by a man I only met once.

My grandpa passed away when I was fourteen. It was sad, but mostly sad because of how hard it was on my dad. Their relationship was complicated, and I know they didn’t get the chance to really sort things out before he went. Not that they ever would have, neither of them were good at talking about emotions. We flew back for the funeral but it was hectic and we didn’t get a chance to visit the cottage again; it passed to my uncle, Paul, my dad’s older brother, and I figured I would probably never see it again.

I was very wrong.

That summer I was invited to a friend’s family cabin on the Sunshine Coast. Ocean coast, not lake. We would be there for a week, romping around and swimming and talking about the girls we liked, the perfect way to spend a couple weeks as a teen.

When we arrived we pulled up around the back of the place, wood paneled and one level. I was pretty focused on being a good guest so I helped pull stuff out of the back, grabbing the massive cooler with a week’s worth of food and carrying it around the front, up the steps to the stilted porch and in the front door, where I dropped it in surprise.

The cabin looked exactly like my grandpa’s.

It had a long table at the front that was made from a single tree trunk, a horrible shag carpet, three bedrooms at the back, a linoleum kitchen in the corner, and a map on the back wall. My friend’s family followed me in and the following interaction went something like this.

“Hey you okay?” asked my friend’s mom, clearly a little annoyed I had dropped the cooler.

“Yeah, just, this looks exactly like my dad’s family cottage back in Ontario,” I replied.

“Oh that’s funny. It was probably built around the same time as this place. My dad built it when I was very young, I know architecture wasn’t his specialty, he just wanted everyone to have somewhere to sleep and somewhere to eat. We added the porch when I was about your age, nice to have somewhere to have coffees in the morning, y’know?”

“Yeah, I guess it was probably the same with my grandpa. Plus with the water right there I suppose there’s not that many design options,” I said. In the end I guess I did half the job of convincing myself that it was a coincidence of waterfront cottage design.

My friend’s mom helped me bring the cooler to the fridge so I wouldn’t drop it again, and we finished unloading the car. My bag had been shimmied to the back of the trunk so I went out last to grab it and close up, and it wasn’t until then that I noticed on the back of the cottage there was a scorched silhouette of an electrical box right next to the working one. 

When I asked my friend about it he claimed it was caused by them having a fire too close to the back of the place one night. When I pointed out it looked exactly like an electrical box he said, “oh yeah, weird.”

I should have left then, although I don’t think it would have helped.

Being fourteen and not wanting to dwell on anything that didn’t involve running around and high school gossip, the spooky similarity of it all slipped out of mind. I had only been ten when I saw my dad’s childhood place after all. 

On the last night I was staying with my friend I noticed the map on the back wall was of lake country Ontario, not coastal British Columbia. I would have asked someone about it but everyone had already turned in. I had stayed up reading, catching some much needed alone time after a week of sharing space with someone else’s family, and had just closed my book and was doing a last look over the cottage, noting the eerie similarities one more time when I decided to take a closer look at the map. It was worn and a little faded, but undeniably Ontario, it had the towns and lakes listed.

I brushed my teeth in the kitchen sink, hairs on the back of my neck standing on end the whole time. The cottage only had an outhouse with no real bathroom, and changed in the front room to avoid disturbing my friend, and just as I was going to creep in and try to fall asleep I heard a noise behind me. It was the clinking of an aluminum tic tac toe set.

I turned around and my grandpa was sitting at the long kitchen table, pulling the pieces off the little board. He looked up at me and scowled ever so slightly.

“Come on kid, we said we would play, let’s play,” he looked back down and started sorting the pieces into x’s and o’s.

I don’t believe in ghosts. Not in the way they’re generally represented and talked about at least, if ghosts exist I think they can only be an extremely personal, immeasurable and unfathomable phenomenon. And at that point there were only three realistic possibilities for what was happening to me. The first was simply that I had fallen asleep while reading and was having a vivid dream, which was very likely. The second was that this was some kind of hallucination or psychotic break, decently likely considering just how vivid this all was, I could remember where I had been prior to this, I could feel, see, hear, and smell. And finally there was the possibility that this was a genuine visit from my dead grandfather, his ghost, spirit or lingering soul. In the first option I was in no danger, the second option, if my brain had already broken none of this would matter, and if this was actually a visit from my late grandpa I figured I should spend some time with him while I could.

So I sat down at the table and played tic tac toe.

At some point between the ages of 10 and 14 I had gotten a brief spurt of interest into game theory, strategy and solved games. So, I knew how to always win (or at least never lose) at tic tac toe. We started playing in silence, and it being a children's game the first round ended quickly, with me winning. My grandpa scowled again, squinting at the board.

“Finally learning, boy. Good,” he said, but he didn’t look happy about it.

The next game he went first, and we drew.

“It’s cold here, eh,” my grandpa said as we were setting up the board again, “wasn’t expecting it to be so cold.”

“I guess,” I said. It wasn’t that cold, nippy at worst. I followed it up with the question that had been burning at me since I sat down, “how are you here Grandpa?”

He smiled with his lips pressed together. “I’ll need a scotch before I can answer that properly,” he said, and gestured for me to go first.

“Did you just come to play tic tac toe with me? Do you have something you want to tell me? Or… ask me to do?”

He huffed. “Can’t a man just play some games with his –” he looked up at me and then back down at the board, “grandson? Is that so strange?” He placed his piece.

*It is if he’s dead,* I thought to myself, but apparently the powers of authority and ancestry extend beyond death because I didn’t say it out loud. I placed my next piece and my grandpa got very still. I think he was realizing he was going to lose again.

“Let me win,” he said quietly, looking down. His voice had gone flat and cold.

“What? Why?” I said, perhaps a little more sharply than I should have. It was stupid, but when I was ten he had never let me win, why should the rules change now?

“Please,” he said, and something fell out of his mouth onto the board. It was a tooth. He looked up and said, “please let me win, I can’t stay here.” But I couldn’t register his words because one of his front teeth fell out as he spoke, and before it could hit the table another tooth folded into place from behind it. Another tooth, then two then three fell out of his mouth, pushed by teeth from behind like dominoes, but they were coming faster than his teeth could fall, clattering tinnily onto the aluminum board, his mouth was full of teeth and they weren’t slowing down. “Please!” he yelled, muffled by a mouth full of bone, and stood up reaching out to grab me by the shoulders. Before he could touch me a voice said something behind me and I wrenched around to ask for help.

My friend was standing there looking disgruntled and not at all freaked out by the tooth-filled old man behind me. I looked back and my grandpa was gone, along with the fallen teeth and tic tac toe board. It was just a quiet, empty cabin looking out at the water.

Apparently I had been yelling and had woken my buddy up. I apologized and said I would explain in the morning. I think he could tell that I was freaked out because he didn’t push any further, and we clambered into the bunk beds to sleep. I was very glad to be in a room with another person, but I didn’t get very much sleep that night. I told him the whole story on the drive back the next day, everything from the cottage similarities to the strange figure to my grandpa begging to win. When I got finished he held his arm up to me.

“Look at that,” he said pointing at his arm, “you got my hairs to stand on end. Dang dude, why didn’t you tell that one around the fire last night? That’s a perfect ghost story, I’m gonna steal it.”

I told him I was serious, that it wasn’t just a ghost story, but all he said was “I believe you man, that’s why it’s so spooky!” And then said he would draw a salt ring around the cottage next time we went, but I was never invited back. Mostly because life changed quite a bit for me when I got back home.

My uncle Paul had died suddenly that weekend. He had been sick on and off in his youth, and the combination of immuno-suppressant drugs he had been taking for decades were hard on his heart, which gave out. Uncle Paul had visited us every third christmas or so, he called regularly, he was close with my dad. Obviously, my father took the news hard, compounded by the fact that a lot of Paul’s estate was passed on to him. Including the cottage.

My dad got very busy very fast. On top of his work he was flying back and forth to Ontario to sort his brother’s will, organize the funeral, visit the family. Paul had been a fun uncle but a bit of a… disheveled individual from an adult’s perspective. He had made some strange monetary decisions that my dad was determined to rectify, or as my dad used to say, “what kind of an idiot would do that on purpose?!” This was often followed by an angry outburst at whoever made the next loud noise, and then a period of quiet stillness where he was clearly trying not to cry, and everyone else was trying not to make any noise. My dad was never great with emotions.

The summer I was sixteen we flew out as a family to Ontario. It was a concentrated effort to see our relations for something other than a funeral, since those had been the only other times we’d been back. We did a bunch of touring around, saw our parents’ childhood homes, went to a Blue Jays game, and went up to the cottage.

I was pretty apprehensive.

I had divulged my terrifying evening at my friend’s cottage when visiting Ontario had first come up, and that launched my dad into a story about his ghostly visit from an old Boy Scout leader when he was in college, which led to a story about the one time he had tried magic mushrooms, which led to the beginning of a story about Uncle Paul’s stoner phase that my dad stopped halfway through. I brought it up again as we were pulling down the long drive towards the cottage, but my dad didn’t respond. My brother called me a coward and pulled out one of my arm hairs.

We crept around the final bend and could see the cottage, its scorched back end the definitive marker. To me it seemed to be hunched down and waiting, poised on nonexistent haunches waiting to spring, full of a strange and undesirable life. But to my dad it was clearly far too devoid of life. We came to a halt and nobody got out of the car. Everyone was silent. Then my dad started to cry, the full bodied sobs of a man left without a trace of his childhood. His cottage once bustling with life and happiness, youth and family was now just an empty shell, a few walls and a roof. Hollow. My mom put a hand on my dad’s arm until the sobs stopped and then without a word we turned around and began the drive back. I couldn’t help but feel relieved, and also a little guilty that I hadn’t been able to summon any excitement about the cottage to make my dad feel like it was alive again.

Life was normal for a long time after that. I went through high school, got into one of the local universities, met a girl, all the big life stuff you’re supposed to do. Everything was as it should have been for a long time, and it was the easiest thing in the world to forget one odd coincidence that caused a bad dream when I was fourteen.

And then my dad got sick.

It started as skin cancer. Normally skin cancer is one of the most treatable types, but it cropped up on him fast, small, and in multiple spots. The doctors did the best they could at cutting the tumors off, and he was doing chemo regularly, but they clearly missed something, or it was just too aggressive. It got into his lymph nodes and spread, beyond the point of operation. It was about a year and a half of watching my dad wither, being eaten in parts by the many small cancers across his head, his jaw, his back, as well as by the treatments trying to keep him alive. It was slow and brutal. You could hardly recognize him by the end, not just physically because of the many surgical sites that had never healed properly, his locked jaw taking his weight down to just a skeletal frame; but also because all of his fiery emotion had been sapped from him. He was hollow when he died. Skin and bone and weeping sores, missing teeth and glazed eyes, with sickly skin and a crooked back.

The following months were a rollercoaster of terrible emotions, anyone who’s been through grief will tell you something similar, but I was finally starting to come out of it when my girlfriend’s family invited me to their ski cabin for a weekend. It would be a nice couple days away from it all. Some cold air in my face and a cozy fire sounded perfect. 

Her parents were always talking about this cabin, “the Chateau” as they called it, because they had been slowly and painstakingly renovating it by hand for the last three years. They were always excitedly mysterious about it when pressed, just saying they had put a lot of work into it and we would get to see it when it was ready, which it finally was.

My girlfriend and I drove up together on Friday after class, her family already up there opening the place up. The sun was out and I was feeling well and truly happy, music playing loud, landscape snowy and clean. I wasn’t thinking about how this was my first time visiting anything resembling a cottage since I was fourteen, after all it was “the Chateau” not a cottage in any sense of the word. But when we pulled into the cul-de-sac my blood ran cold. I knew this place.

The Chateau stood out like a sore thumb, every other cabin was made of a mix of stone and rounded logs, with firewood stacked under steep A-frame eaves and small windows to make insulation easy. The Chateau was my dad’s old cottage, wood paneled, gently peaked roof, a stilted front porch that should have been impossible on flat ground but for some reason wasn’t. 

My girlfriend parked the car and hopped out excitedly.

“Come on, I can’t wait to see what they’ve done with the inside,” she said and bustled up the steps, the sight of her going up stairs but remaining on the ground floor hurting my brain, and disappeared inside. I got out into the silent white stillness of the winter evening. I walked around back to find the burned shadow of the electrical box where I already knew it was. I stood in front of the cottage in the quiet, feeling numb but not from the cold. 

I guess I don’t quite know why I went inside. Undoubtedly there was the naturally dangerous human curiosity that drove it to a certain extent, the need to find out how this could be, but there must have been more at work inside of me than just that. I may never know.

I was expecting to find my girlfriend’s family inside, the three of them marvelling over a linoleum kitchen that looked like it was from the seventies even though they had just renovated it, a shag carpet, an inexplicable map of Ontario. But this time the cottage didn’t wait for the deep of night. When I stepped inside there was only one person there, still skeletal thin, cancerous sores still openly weeping: my dad.

In his hand he clutched a cribbage board. It was the same one that lived on the bookshelf in his childhood cottage, this cottage as I’m now sure it was, and he clutched it in his emaciated hand like a drowning man clutches a lifesaver. 

As I entered my dad began to move, painstakingly making his way over to the long kitchen table and began to set up the cribbage board.

“Come on kiddo, let’s see if I can skunk ya,” he said. It was clear that he was trying to be lighthearted, trying to summon the essence of cheer we used to have when we played crib on weekend afternoons, but the cancer in his jaw meant he had to speak through nearly clenched teeth. And his eyes were still so hollow. 

I had sat down and cut the deck before I really registered it. I had dreamt of my dad pretty frequently since he died, always something along the same lines. I would be going about a regular day when I would be struck with the sudden reminder that my dad was dead, that I would never see him again or hear his voice, and just as I would begin truly breaking down over this fact he would arrive. Walk in through the front door or bike up the driveway, not just alive but cancer free and happy. And then in the midst of my new relief that his death had all been a terrible misunderstanding I would wake up to the reality that he was in fact gone.

This was like the reverse of that. I felt like I was in a dream where I thought my dad was alive, he was right in front of me after all, but he would drop dead just as I realized it. Maybe that would be for the best.

We played in silence. The cards were shuffled and handed out, decisions made, pegging done back and forth, points counted, and repeat. It’s impossible to truly get enough time with the ones you love, impossible to say absolutely everything you need to say, but despite this we played in silence. Just the sound of cards and pegs. 

I was losing.

I had been playing with my head down for some time, afraid to meet my father’s hollow eyes, when I heard him make a noise and looked up. The tumors on his head had grown, multiplied horribly beyond what they ever had been in life, blood streaking from burst skin and dripping onto the table and floor, flaps of skin and chunks of hair dangling from his face, forced aside by the swollen tumors. His jaw was now totally locked by the masses, but I saw that for the first time tonight, the first time in months before he died, his eyes were clear.

“Run,” he said, clear as day. 

I did. I didn’t hesitate, I didn’t wait for him to repeat himself. I can’t help but feel like in that moment it was truly my dad speaking to me, not the horrid cottage that had been following me for the last decade, or whatever terrible creature that had made its home inside of it, but some version of my dad that reached out to speak that word. 

I leaped for the door, the old hinges squealing as I ripped it open. I heard noises behind me, wet splatters like massive zits popping, and the sound of something hard and brittle scraping across wood. As I got the door open, there was a sound like  someone twice my size vomiting and belching at the same time, and a gust of air was vacuumed past me into the cottage. I didn’t look back. I made it to the car and got it started with no issues, operating entirely on instinct, before I looked up as I backed down the drive. The mouth of the cottage yawned open, my dad’s disfigured form silhouetted in the entry, seeming to hang like a puppet rather than stand. I drove away in a daze.

My girlfriend called me 20 minutes later. I immediately felt awful. I had ran, without sparing a thought for her or her family, and realized with a wash of relief when she called that I had assumed they had been absorbed or murdered by the strange cottage. Hearing her voice was a balm, I made up a lie about getting a frantic call from my mom and apologized for not coming inside to let her know about my sudden departure. I resolved to ask her about the Chateau later, what she saw when she entered it, where she had been when I went inside, but I was too rattled to ask then and there. I don’t think anything she would have said would have helped, at most it would have made me sound crazy. Although, I suppose I must be.

You see, I drove home to my mother’s house, my childhood home. Where I grew up, where my family still lives, the most comforting place I know, a building I am so intimate with I can navigate it inside and out with my eyes closed. But I turned the corner onto our block just now and it isn’t my home that’s sitting just behind the sidewalk.

It’s my dad’s old cottage.

Whether you’ve collected mugs from your travels, received them from loved ones, or simply have a favorite you reach for each morning, taking proper care of your coffee mugs ensures they remain beautiful and functional for years.

In this detailed guide, we’ll explore the best practices for cleaning, maintaining, and even restoring your favorite coffee mugs. Plus, we’ll share some interesting facts about why proper mug care matters more than you might think.

 

[coffee mug](https://preview.redd.it/udtfziuvuk0f1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35082def944a500b38dd43834b265f4dac309fae)

**Why Proper** [**Coffee Mug**](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden) **Care Matters**

Before we dive into techniques, let’s look at why caring for your coffee mugs is important:

* **Prolongs the life of the mug:** With regular care, mugs won’t develop cracks, stains, or odors.
* **Preserves design and print:** Harsh cleaning methods can fade printed graphics or destroy ceramic glazes.
* **Enhances taste experience:** A clean mug ensures your coffee tastes fresh, not bitter or soapy.
* **Promotes hygiene:** Residue from previous drinks can harbor bacteria, especially in cracks or hard-to-reach areas.

 

**1. Understanding Your Mug’s Material**

Different mugs need different care. Here's a breakdown of common types:

**Ceramic and Porcelain Mugs**

* **Care level:** Moderate
* **Dishwasher-safe?** Often yes, but handwashing is better for printed designs
* **Tips:** Avoid drastic temperature changes that can cause cracks

**Glass Mugs**

* **Care level:** Easy to moderate
* **Dishwasher-safe?** Usually yes
* **Tips:** Use non-abrasive sponges to avoid scratching the surface

**Stainless Steel Travel Mugs**

* **Care level:** Moderate
* **Dishwasher-safe?** Many are not
* **Tips:** Clean lids thoroughly, as they often trap liquid and grow mold

**Stoneware Mugs**

* **Care level:** Moderate
* **Dishwasher-safe?** Sometimes, but handwash to preserve finish
* **Tips:** Avoid soaking, as porous stoneware can absorb water

 

**2. Best Practices for Daily Cleaning**

Keeping your coffee mugs fresh is simple with consistent daily habits.

**Warm Soapy Water**

* Use mild dish soap and warm water
* Scrub gently with a soft sponge
* Rinse thoroughly to remove soap residue

**Avoid Harsh Abrasives**

* Stay away from steel wool or scouring pads—they can scratch and wear away the glaze or printed design

**Dry with Care**

* Air drying is great, but towel drying with a soft cloth also works
* Ensure the bottom rim is fully dry to prevent water spots or mildew

 

**3. Deep Cleaning for Stubborn Stains**

Coffee and tea can leave behind unsightly brown stains. Here are safe, effective methods to clean them:

**Baking Soda Paste**

* Mix baking soda and water into a thick paste
* Scrub the inside of the mug with it using a sponge
* Rinse well

**Vinegar and Salt**

* Pour white vinegar into the mug until halfway full
* Add a spoonful of salt
* Let it sit for 10 minutes, then scrub gently

**Lemon Juice**

* Lemon’s natural acidity breaks down stains
* Squeeze fresh lemon juice into the mug and rub with the peel
* Let sit for 5–10 minutes before rinsing

**Hydrogen Peroxide and Baking Soda (for extreme stains)**

* Combine hydrogen peroxide and baking soda to form a foaming mixture
* Let it sit inside the mug for 10–15 minutes
* Scrub and rinse thoroughly

 

**4. How to Eliminate Odors**

Sometimes your favorite mug can trap the scent of past beverages. Here's how to freshen it up:

* Fill the mug with a mixture of vinegar and water
* Let sit overnight
* Rinse thoroughly in the morning

Alternatively, place a teaspoon of baking soda in the mug, add warm water, and let sit for a few hours.

 

**5. Caring for Mugs with Printed Designs or Personalized Text**

Mugs with sentimental or aesthetic value—those with logos, photos, or messages—require extra attention.

* **Always handwash:** Even if labeled “dishwasher-safe,” handwashing helps preserve artwork.
* **Use lukewarm water:** Hot water can cause fading over time
* **Avoid soaking:** Extended exposure to water can lift decals or printed layers

 

**6. Dishwasher Dos and Don’ts**

If you must use a dishwasher, keep these rules in mind:

**DO:**

* Place mugs securely to avoid chipping
* Use mild detergent
* Check the label to confirm dishwasher compatibility

**DON’T:**

* Put heavily stained mugs in without pre-rinsing
* Place printed mugs on the bottom rack (closer to the heating element)
* Wash travel mugs unless the manufacturer says it’s safe

 

**7. Seasonal or Rotational Care**

If you rotate your mug collection or store seasonal designs (e.g., Christmas-themed mugs), keep them clean and chip-free while in storage.

* Clean thoroughly before storing
* Wrap in soft cloth or bubble wrap
* Store in a cool, dry place
* Avoid stacking heavy mugs on top of each other

 

**8. Fun Facts About Coffee Mugs**

To keep things interesting, here are some coffee mug facts you may not know:

* The first ceramic mugs were found in China and date back to around 3000 BCE.
* The largest coffee mug ever created could hold over 3,000 gallons of coffee.
* Some people report that coffee tastes better from their “favorite” mug—a psychological phenomenon called the **“mug effect.”**
* Using a red or orange-colored mug may enhance perceived warmth of the drink (a concept from color psychology).
* Reusing mugs instead of disposable cups saves over **1 billion paper cups** annually.

 

**9. Restoring Damaged or Scratched Mugs**

If your mug has seen better days, here are a few options:

* **Scratches on ceramic?** Try gently buffing with toothpaste or baking soda paste
* **Cracks?** Avoid microwaving, as hairline cracks can worsen
* **Loose handles?** Use food-safe adhesive, but it’s often better to retire it from daily use

**Pro tip:** Consider reusing chipped mugs as pen holders, planters, or candle holders!

 

**10. When to Let Go of a Mug**

It can be hard to say goodbye, but here are signs it might be time:

* Deep cracks or chips that could harbor bacteria
* Discoloration that doesn’t come off with deep cleaning
* Faded or peeling paint or prints (especially unsafe for microwaves)

 

**Conclusion**

Your coffee mug does more than just hold your favorite brew—it holds your daily routine together. By giving it the care it deserves, you not only protect your investment but also improve your coffee-drinking experience.

From daily cleaning tips to deep stain removal and even fun facts, taking the time to clean and care for your favorite coffee mugs ensures they’ll continue to bring comfort, flavor, and personality into your day.

1klqmg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1klqmg1/i_lost_my_soul_dog/,I lost my soul dog…,"On Friday, May 9th, I lost my best friend & my soul dog. She had been with me through so much in my life. 

We got her as a family dog in February of 2013, she was a puppy, one that my sister chose and begged for and that we drove back to get. My parents divorced soon after that. She lived with me, my mom, and sisters. My mom could no longer care for her properly, so she went on to live with my dad for some time. We got to visit him every weekend and so I saw her at least once a week. In 2017, I was living with my high school boyfriend and his family. We decided it would be a great idea to take her in since they had a decent yard and I would be able to see her more often. She’s lived with me up until now. She’s gotten me through a divorce (my parents), a breakup, my first big girl job, getting my college degree, COVID, finding the love of my life, and so much more. And now I feel so empty without her. All of my milestones as a teenager to adulthood were shared with her.

We knew she didn’t have much time since January of this year. She got really ill one night and we took her to the ER to get checked out. It was our worst nightmare… the big C. The tumor in her spleen was massive. It was pushing up on her spine, making it extremely noticeable. Her tummy was bloated, and they suggested we put her down soon. She seemed so happy still, wagging her tail, wanting to play with the staff. We decided to get a second opinion the next day and thank god we did. The second vet suggested we do hospice care and pain management. He said she’d likely have 1-3 months to live, but she was not ready to go that same day. We went home with so many mixed emotions because everyday we struggled with her health. We had to be cautious so she didn’t rupture the tumor, she had bouts of diarrhea, but ultimately she was still her goofy self. She gave us a good FOUR months after her original diagnosis. A whole month more than what the vet predicted. And we are so happy to have had that extra time with her. But it still doesn’t change the fact that she’s no longer here. I won’t be able to sniff her stinky dorito paws, or do our daily routines. Our lives revolved around her. I am grateful she was able to pass peacefully though. She was in pain, the tumor had grown and it was making her have accidents in the house. It was her time. But now I’m so fucking lonely. I work from home and she was my work buddy. She stuck to me like velcro. Im struggling with even making coffee, let alone cooking food because she was always right beside me waiting for me to hand her something. Whether it was lettuce, a banana, or strawberry, she was always there for the snack tax. I am shattered. I do have a cat, but he’s always been to himself for the most part. And even with him here, it’s still so quiet. I miss the clanking of her paws against the floor, her snoring while I work, the way she drank water when I was in an important call and would make so much noise.

1klqk6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BBQGrill/comments/1klqk6g/why_electactic_3burner_gas_grill_review_reveals/,Why Electactic 3-Burner Gas Grill Review Reveals Top Features for Outdoor Cooking,"**Strong & Durable Build for Outdoor Enthusiasts**  
I’ve been grilling for years, testing products big and small, and the moment I unpacked the Electactic EL-G0131A 3-Burner Propane Gas Grill, its stainless steel construction grabbed my attention. The metal feels solid—like it’s ready to defy rain and rust, which is honestly a must for outdoor cooking equipment. Its polished finish adds a sleek, modern touch to my patio, making it a stylish centerpiece for weekend barbecues. My cousin joked that it’s a “grill that’ll outlast your patience,” and he might be right. However, the included plastic components, while functional, felt a bit flimsy compared to the stainless steel.  

**Cooking Versatility That Doesn’t Disappoint**  
The highlight of this grill for me is the thoughtful combination of three burners plus a side burner, delivering a total of 37,000 BTU. That heat output is plenty to grill everything from steaks to veggies. I used the side burner for heating marinades while the three main burners tackled kabobs and burgers simultaneously. The built-in thermometer in the lid is surprisingly accurate, which was a big deal during my steak experiment. Medium-rare perfection? Absolutely nailed it. That said, take your time adjusting the heat levels because the knobs feel slightly loose, which might make precision trickier for newcomers.  

[Check Electactic EL-G0131A price on Amazon.](https://thebbqgrill.com/p/b0djxy83p1/)  

**Spacious Cooking Area That Feels Satisfyingly Generous**  
With a 373-square-inch grilling surface and an extra 142-square-inch warming rack, there’s ample space to go wild with your BBQ ideas. I hosted a small family get-together and grilled 10 burgers, a handful of hotdogs, and corn, all in one go. It freed up so much time since I didn’t need to wait between rounds. Does the warming rack do its job? Yes, it keeps cooked food warm without drying it out.  

**Advantages**  
- Sturdy stainless steel construction resists rust and wear.  
- Ample cooking space for simultaneous grilling and warming.  
- Porcelain-enameled cast iron grates offer even heat distribution.  
- Side burner adds flexibility for sauces or side dishes.  

**Cleaning Made Less of a Hassle**  
This grill isn’t winning any awards for being a joy to clean, but it scores high for practicality. The porcelain-enameled grates make it easy to wipe off residue since food doesn’t stick much. The pull-out oil pan underneath is a lifesaver because it collects grease efficiently, eliminating messy splatters on my patio floor. A quick tip: use a rag or non-abrasive sponge—too much force might risk scratching the polished finish. Still, reaching those tiny grooves can require a bit of effort, so consider it a minor chore after feasting.  

**Assembly and Mobility: A Practical Touch**  
I’m not the most patient DIY guy, but the included user manual made assembling the grill straightforward. Within about 40 minutes (not counting my coffee break), it was ready to fire up. The wheels at the base? Absolutely invaluable. I could glide it around the yard with ease, and parking it near the storage shed when not in use didn’t turn into a workout. On the downside, the grill weighs around 69 pounds, which means lifting it for transport is out of the question unless you’ve got two people around.  

**Negatives**  
- Slightly wobbly knob settings could impact precise temperature control.  
- Cleanup for the inner components can be time-consuming.  

**Competing Products: Are There Better Choices?**  
I’ve owned and tested grills like the Weber Spirit II and a budget-friendly Char-Broil Classic, so comparing those to this one was natural. The Weber offers stronger build quality and slightly more consistent heat distribution but lacks the spacious storage area that the Electactic grill provides. On the other hand, the Char-Broil is a win if you’re on a tight budget, though its lower heat output doesn’t match the grilling versatility here. Where this product truly shines is its balance of affordability, construction strength, and design—something competitors often lack in unison.  

**Best Value**  
For its feature-rich build, this grill provides a solid balance between cost efficiency and high performance. Its polished finish, multifunction burners, and cooking space justify its price tag for serious BBQ enthusiasts or even beginners ready to dive in.

1klqihb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1klqihb,Overseas Haul: Vulcan Feu and Aqua Oud,"Got these delivered in 10 days from FilledWithBarakah for 124 USD including international shipping from London to NY. Beautiful presentation on both.

Aqua Oud by Ahmed Al Maghribi: ADG Profondo with a Middle Eastern twist. Aquatic, aromatic, freshie with a touch of spice. The woody accords are noticeably dialed up compared to its inspiration, I get a hint of oud in the dry down. Performance surprisingly leaves much to be desired and stays on skin for around 6 hours. Projects moderately for 3. Definitely doesn't punch as hard out of the box as its cousin Kaaf does, but I’m decanting it for my work drawer anyway. Perfect for office environments as it's clean and inoffensive, go ahead and spray away! 8/10

Vulcan Feu by French Avenue: Now THIS one is a nuclear basilisk! Never smelled God of Fire and I don’t need to! Like sheeshhh, this thing has no business being that good. WOW. Fresh, ripe mango bomb supported by ginger, lemon, and rhubarb off the top. Highly addictive, sweet, tropical sensation perfect for the summer on both sexes. I haven't given it a full wear yet, but one spray on a test strip sitting on my coffee table 6 feet away from me was creeping into my nostrils for days lol that mango note doesn't die. So far a 10/10, well worth the hype imo.

1klqhz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1klqhz4/vegan_chocolate_uk/,Vegan chocolate (UK),"Really disappointed by the lack of new vegan products coming out. I’m in my third trimester of pregnancy and in the mood for some nice chocolate.

Recently, I’ve noticed that there is less and less vegan options wherever I go. some examples of this are in Costa coffee shop there is now only one type of vegan cake and it’s a small prepackaged flapjack by the tills.
Also in Subway, they’ve stopped doing fake meats and only do a veggie patty now which sucks.
Chocolate wise, I haven’t seen a new chocolate come out in so long, I usually buy the Nomo cookie dough from Tesco’s but it’s like £4.50 now which is absolutely insane. 
Just a rant I guess, what kind of chocolate do you like to buy? I’m looking for a chocolate that melts well and is really creamy. ",18,1747153987.0,vegan,10,0.96,False

1klqg7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingsmoking/comments/1klqg7w/dont_think_i_hate_cigg_enough_to_quit_smoking/,Dont think I hate cigg enough to quit smoking,"I am slowly but steadily curbing all my addictions, I dealt with weed(6 months clean) and porn(4 months clean), screentime reduced from 13-14 hrs a day to 5-6 hrs but cigg smoking increased significantly from 4-5 a day to 13-14 a day, minimum. It feels like the only thing thats preventing me from falling back to my old addictions is smoking ciggs. And, I have heavily romanticize smoking while drinking coffee.

I have tried Allen Carr's audio book (twice), chantix and some gums. I just return back to smoking anyway. I can go 2 days without smoking during family trip and the moment I step foot inside my home, Im back to smoking, thinking ""yeah that was a nice break from smoking anyway"".

I have plenty of hobbies, some I picked up just to stop smoking, like running or maintaining balcony plants. Now I love the sensation I get from smoking after a long run cuz it gives the tingling sensation that normally doesnt. Or, ""damn my balcony looks nice with all these plants i have installed, good spot for coffee and ciggs""(ex-stoner mentality). My 2 closest friends are smokers, we are not expected to meet for next 6 months so this might be the best time to quit for good, or thats what i thought.

Sometimes I think, maybe an accountability partner would be nice, but then, if the partner ghosts me, would I fall back to smoking?, or even worse, I give up and leave my partner in the middle of their journey. 

I also hate medication, my first physiatrist gave me a bunch of meds that made me lethargic. I hated that feeling. At this point, I dont even remember how many times I have tried to quit. Maybe my only hope is to join a rehab ? Any advice or criticism is welcome.

1klqes2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1klqes2/haul_reviews_solstice_scents_and_nui_cobalt/,Haul Reviews: Solstice Scents and Nui Cobalt,"Hello, IMAM! It has been a while since I posted a fragrance review, but recently, I placed orders with [both Solstice Scents and Nui Cobalt](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1kdcrvn/my_solstice_scents_and_nui_cobalt_orders_arrived/)—two houses with which I’ve had a lot of success in the past. I concentrated on fragrances that I thought would be good for colder weather transitioning into warmth, since spring is taking its sweet time to truly arrive where I’m at.

Disclaimer: When I test and write fragrance reviews, I don’t double-check the notes list beforehand, operating solely on my perception (though I ostensibly had chosen these fragrances because of their notes).

Now, on to the reviews!

**Solstice Scents**

“Gibbons Mischief Night” – *Sugar Cookies, Vanilla Frosting, White Chocolate Popcorn, Toasted Marshmallow, Graham Crackers, Gibbon's Boarding School, Cream Soda, Bourbon, Pear Brandy*

This bad boy was the first one I opened, since I was eager to try the poster gourmand scent (as it were) from Solstice. The initial whiff was a *lot* of caramel popcorn, to the point where I worried it might be too cloying for me. However, that opening was brief, and what it settled into was one of the most delicious chocolate accords I’ve encountered in a perfume. Previously I have praised CocoaPink “Black Chocolate” and Fyrinnae “Chocolatine,” but I think GMN might genuinely have surpassed both. I was astounded at how rich and decadent, yet not overpowering, this chocolate was. Designer perfumes *wish* they could be this delicious.

Funnily enough, chocolate—by itself—is not listed among the notes! But they seem to all come together to perfect cacao’s final form.

Rating: **5**/5 – chocolate coma

“Crimson Sap and Sassafras” – *Dragon’s blood, Sassafras, Palo Santo, Anise, Frankincense, Marshmallow, Benzoin, Vanilla Cream Soda, Crimson Musk*

This one… oh, this one. It has taken me *years* to track this one down. I remember finding the profile for this fragrance on Fragrantica (which I don’t use anymore, but did at the start of my fragrance journey) and being utterly fascinated. It sounded like nothing I’d ever smelled before. Later that year, at a Renaissance Faire of all places, I got a vial of dragon’s blood perfume oil and was convinced I adored the scent—it’s often cola- or even root beer-like, with an underlying bracing, coldly resinous quality. It’s a unique scent, and usually the star wherever it’s present.

Why did it take me so long to find this? Well, I thought it was discontinued. Why did I think this was discontinued? Well… because I was always checking the Fall and Winter catalog for Solstice, not realizing this is actually a Summer scent. For the record, I don’t think this is a Summer scent. At all. I don’t know why it’s part of the Summer catalog, but… it is, and that’s where you’ll find CSaS.

*Anyway*… the scent itself: it reminds me quite a bit of Nui Cobalt “Cancan,” except the licorice is dialed down a bit in favor of the bracing dragon’s blood. But it’s a cool, welcome sweetness that’s highly reminiscent of old-fashioned root beer (sassafras). AND IT LASTS. Oh my gosh, a little goes a long way, and it lasts an entire day on skin, I kid you not. You get your money’s worth with this one, and I’m pleased to announce that this lived up to the hype.

Rating: **5**/5 – *Dracarys!*

“Island Blackstrap” – *coconut, dark rum, pineapple, sugar cane, simple syrup, blackstrap molasses, caramelized sugar, oak barrels, tropical flowers, splash of sea spray, vetiver, tonka*

Oh, this one’s fun! The opening is a big ol’ burst of rich pineapple, like somebody just cut open a pineapple they *just* picked off the tree! After that, it settles into a spiced, slightly boozy molasses that projects mightily—my mom told me I smelled really good (but she thought I smelled like “cinnamon or nutmeg”). Disappointingly, when I was testing this fragrance, I got startled as I was applying and accidentally dropped the sample vial on my bedroom rug. Which means my room smells wonderful! But yeah, I lost about half the vial, which is a bummer.

Rating: **5**/5 – tropical vacation

“Iced Persimmon” – *Vanilla Frozen Custard, Persimmon Pulp, Tonka Bean Extract, Vanilla Waffle Cone, Sugar Cone, Clove, Nutmeg, Cinnamon*

Solstice Scents gives you the option of selecting your freebie sample, and I chose “Iced Persimmon.” It’s something that has deeply intrigued me since it came out, but my trepidation was due to it being an alcohol-based fragrance rather than mostly oil. After I entered the world of indies, I soon discovered that I much prefer the development of oils on my skin to EdPs or EdTs, even if I must sacrifice projection. *But*… if I wasn’t paying for it, then what was the harm? lol

The fragrance itself is very interesting—persimmons have a warm scent naturally, very Christmas-like. When I had Nui Cobalt’s “Persimmon Preserves,” just a little bit would project across an office space (I had to be careful with that one!), and more than one person wanted to know what room spray smelled so lovely “for the holidays.” I only wore that one when it snowed outside. That said, Solstice took on the difficult job of cooling the persimmon down for the summer, and they largely succeeded, creating an accord that reminds me of sherbet. Summer squash sherbet. Is that a thing?

I will say, however, that I’m still of a mind that I vastly prefer oils to EdPs, so this one will be going to a new home.

Rating: **4**/5 – persimmon sherbet

“Gehenna” – *Red Musk, Dragon’s Blood Resin, Amber, Burning Wood, Somalian Myrrh, Egyptian Musk, Oud*

When I opened this vial, I was greeted with yet more dragon’s blood—deep, resinous, and dark. But in the end, it was far more “hippie” than the afterlife destination of the wicked for the atonement of their sins. Rather like a hippie getting dressed up for a job interview: deep, resinous, almost patchouli-like, but also with hints of what can only be described as “cologne.” This is likely because it, like “Iced Persimmon,” is an EdP. (Though now I’m surprised to see that “Gibbon’s Mischief Night” is *also* an EdP.)

One of my coworkers came by my desk to visit with me a bit, and she eagerly asked what that smell was, because she loved it. I wound up telling her all about Solstice Scents (she isn’t part of the indie scene at all), and since I wasn’t a big fan of it (but she loved it so much), I agreed to bring my sample to the office and give it to her, for which she was very thankful.

Rating: **3**/5 – Abode of the (Grateful) Dead

“Sirocco” – *Sandalwood, Saffron Threads, Hot Baked Earth, Myrrh, Spices, Oud & Jasmine*

The last sample from the Solstice order that I tested was the one I’d had the littlest idea about regarding the smell. Would it be like the surface of Arakis? Or less spice and more sand and desert vegetation?

Upon opening the vial, I was struck by how… *tangy* it was. I was not expecting tanginess. At all. I put a little bit on my arm, and gradually the minute sour edge dissipated in favor of a very fresh cologne. Someone into more androgynous perfumes might like this one, but I found it too masculine for me.

Rating: **2**/5 – less “spice mélange” and more what Paul Atreides wears on a given day

**Nui Cobalt**

“Choose Your Own Adventure” – *cracked coriander seed, ginger root, Thai basil, tangy mulberry, vermillion musk, cherrywood, and tonka bean*

FRUIT SNACKS!

Opened the vial and got a whiff of FRUIT SNACKS!

Applied to skin and smelled a whole lot more FRUIT SNACKS!

Sorry, but… there wasn’t a whole lot of evolution here: it maintained a “fruit snacks” (or maybe vitamin gummies) accord throughout the wear time, which I think was four hours or so. I don’t dislike it, but I’ve already encountered “fruit snacks” and was hoping this would be something else. It reminded me a lot of “Blackberry Peach Preserves” (also NC: *ripened plump blackberries, vanilla sugar, luscious peach, and subtle spice*). Looking at the notes list now, the mulberry must be working overtime to create this accord—unless Thai basil is also sweet and fruity?

Rating: **3**/5 – Gushers™. That’s what this smells like: Gushers™.

“Eastern Chipmunk” – *pecans and pistachios with Moroccan spiced coffee, black fig preserves, and roasted marshmallow*

This one has been on my to-test list for ages, but admittedly, the Critters were not a collection that I’d prioritized, so… it just sat there. I finally bought a sample, and at that first sniff out the vial, [this clip immediately played in my mind](https://youtu.be/DnKcTTPUjyU?si=5vRFgDUekH9PPMhM&t=133).

I was not prepared for Christmas. But it was *so incredibly… CHRISTMAS!* The mingling cinnamon and minty spices—it was somehow more Christmas than Possets “Peppermint Pig,” which is saying something. If the accord had lasted any longer, Nat King Cole would’ve started playing.

But Christmas doesn’t stay… at least, not in so saturated a fashion. It settles down into what is basically a much quieter version of “River Otter” (Archive) from the same collection. Most of the same notes, just no smoke. So, if you liked everything about “River Otter” (*languid amber accents dark patchouli and sandalwood with Peru balsam and teak while balancing the playful sweetness of homemade maple fudge*) except the smoke, then go ahead and get “Eastern Chipmunk.” For me, though… I was kind of let down that it got so quiet.

Rating: **3.5**/5 – little [ground squirrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_squirrel) leaping and playing

“Great-Eared Nightjar” – *labdanum, sweet myrrh, pipe tobacco, guaiac wood, dragon’s blood, blackcurrant, and santal*

As the sixth overall fragrance I tested from the combined orders, this was my first genuine misfire. I did not expect to smell beeswax when opening the vial, but I did, and that is a note I do not enjoy. It was beeswax with a hint of dragon’s blood, but the latter had nothing sweet to temper it. There was no warmth on my skin—it was cold, cold, cold. Looking at the notes now, I think the blackcurrant was completely drowned out, and no sweetness was brought to the woods and resins.

Rating: **2**/5 – ♫ [Cold, cold, cold, cold as ice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n95eekfFZZg)… ♫

“Knavery” – *A fluffy, oven-baked pancake bursting with richly flavored fruit. Hints of port wine and bright orange zest accentuate this decadent dessert.*

The first of my freebies that I tried, this one was a slam-dunk. It opened with an incredibly boozy note, which I put down to rum, but eventually evolved into delicious oatmeal raisin cookies for the better part of a workday. My order had concentrated on the Gamers & Geeks (which was on the verge of retiring for the year) and the Critters, and it actually ignored the April Fools; but looking at my to-test list, “Knavery” was at the top for that collection! So, it’s a good thing that one was one of my freebies—and, at that point, it was my favorite of the Nui Cobalt order.

Funnily enough, what I identified as “oatmeal raisin cookies” was supposed to be Fig Clafoutis, which I’ve never heard of (though I love figs, and can recognize them in the fragrance now). The booze part still smells more like rum to me than port wine, though (but I’m not complaining).

Rating: **5**/5 – all I’m missing is a cigar

“Infernal Constitution” – *mulled plum wine, dragon’s blood resin, redwood, and smoldering oudh*

When I opened this one, I was greeted with the most delicious red wine accord. Something like a Malbec, or a Cabernet Franc (surprisingly, according to the notes it should be mulled *umeshu*). Since I love a good wine scent, this raised my hopes enormously!

Sadly, that only lasted about thirty minutes. After that, I was left with… soap. Very fancy soap. This basically smelled like a wedding: glasses of cheer followed by little novel party favors of heart-shaped soap. Clearly, I’m not fond of the combination of dragon’s blood and oud—or dragon’s blood and santal/sandalwood—though I like each note individually.

Rating: **2**/5 – Wine in the shower is *not* what I was after.

“Oath of Vengeance” – *thorned blackberry bramble, strong Ceylon tea, Egyptian musk, peppercorn and a dark trace of myrrh*

The opening of this was fruity, but not as saturated as that of “Choose Your Own Adventure.” It smelled less sugary, but fizzier. I was briefly excited about this accord before I stopped and hoped, “Please, please don’t turn into soap.”

Sadly, that’s exactly what happened. Just like “Infernal Constitution,” it went aldehydic, and I was left with soap.

Rating: **2**/5 – fruit snack-scented soap

“Red Admiral Butterfly” – *blood orange, nasturtium flower, coriander, subtle blackwood, wild strawberry, and fresh garden basil*

Upon opening the vial, I was greeted with such a lovely fruit cocktail. It actually reminded me of CocoaPink “Eve’s Ambrosia,” which further reminded me of shampoo (because I’d chosen that scent for a shampoo). The fruit accord did, indeed, grow more shampoo-like before fading almost completely after two hours.

Rating: **2.5**/5 – Wait… stop… come back…

“Capybara” – *crisp aquatic greens, allspice, feijoa, acai blossom, ylang, and yuzu*

This one was almost identical to “Red Admiral Butterfly” upon opening, just a touch more aquatic. On skin, the yuzu is the star, without question. It’s still a bit soapy, but more like fruity shampoo instead of a bar of body soap—though I do recommend it to yuzu lovers. In looking at the notes list now, though, I should’ve known that “greens” plus “ylang” would make an accord too soapy for my taste.

Rating: **2.5**/5 – Still prefer my Haus of Gloi Tonic #4 for my yuzu fix, though…

“Bamboozle” – *diaphanous layers of flaky, golden pastry, toasted pistachio, roasted chestnut, crushed almond, and a generous drizzle of spring harvest honey*

SNICKERDOODLES!

Wow, the smell of snickerdoodles was strong. “Bamboozle” hadn’t been on my April Fools to-test list, but I knew there was a snickerdoodle one, so my mind made the connection. But my first impressions were of peanuts and caramel. It was rich and lush, and I *slightly* regretted applying it early in the morning because it was so strong. Thankfully, it mellowed out while not getting too perfume-y, if that makes sense.

Color me surprised when I looked up the notes to post this and realized this was the baklava fragrance, not the snickerdoodle. It has lots of notes I enjoy, but what had kept me from it were the almonds and honey, which are two of my death notes. I am so grateful that the chestnuts and pistachios seem to be working overtime to make the almonds smell like peanuts, and that something else (chestnut again?) is making the honey read as caramel.

Rating: **4**/5 – I’ve truly been bamboozled.

“Elven Accuracy” – *bright nasturtium flower, spiced mulberry jam, white cedarwood, pale musk, and liatrix*

What a whimper this set went out on. I thought I detected a vague fizziness when I first applied to the skin, but two hours later I smelled *nothing*. My skin ate this one up in no time flat. I almost didn’t even post a review of this, because I have next to no impression. But in referring to the notes now… I probably don’t like nasturtium and should stay away from it.

Rating: **???**/5 – hardly knew ya

And… that’s it for these! I’m a bit disheartened at how much of a bust the Nui Cobalt order was—the only successes were the freebies, to be honest. Conversely, I was very happy with my Solstice order. Now, I’ll be moving on to testing the Morari and Possets samples I got through Ajevie.",11,1747153779.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,0.93,False

We're getting a little desperate for teachers to sign up — I think this is likely due to the Trump effect — so I wonder, will you please help share this conference opportunity with any teachers you know in Montreal or the surrounding area, or consider signing up and attending? A Reddit meet-up at a teacher conference, wouldn't that be cute?

1klqd0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1klqd0y/rf_the_last_letter/,[RF] The Last Letter,"The morning felt like any other. The hot Arizona sun spilling across the kitchen tiles, the hiss of eggs in the pan, and the sounds of Spanish radio playing in the background. Lucia was sitting in a chair next to the cracked kitchen table, braiding her sister's hair, just the way Papa used to-tight down the middle, with the end tied in a thin red band. 

	“Too tight,” Ari whined,

	“It’s supposed to be tight, you know? You want it to stay all day, do you not?” Lucia muttered with a smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. 

	Their father stood at the sink, washing his coffee mug while their mother cooked breakfast. He looked tired, his eyes red from another early shift. Despite his tiredness, he smiled at Lucia like he always did, he was the center of her world, the world he had built with his bare hands. 

	“Do you have everything?” he asked, putting on his hole-covered jacket. His keys kingled from the hook by the door. 

	“I think so, let me check,” Lucia said, “yes I do! Where are you headed off to?” 

	He shrugged, “Just going to the grocery store, I’ll be back before noon. See you then, sweetheart.” 

	Lucia watched as he bent down to kiss Ari’s forehead, then hers. His beard stubble scratched her cheek. He then chuckled revealing his golden tooth. 

	Then the door closed. And he was gone. 

	The sun sank, and sank, announcing the arrival of nightfall. Lucia knew something was wrong. 

	The groceries did not come. Neither did the hum of Papa’s truck in the driveway. Her mother paced by the window, phone clutched in her hand. She dialed frantically just to be received by Papa’s voicemail. She redialed and redialed, in hopes he would pick up his phone. No answer. 

	At 9:43 p.m., the phone rang. 

	Lucia watched her mother’s face change in slow motion, her hands shaking. The tension in her brow collapsed into something heavier, older. She opened her mouth as if she was about to speak, but only let out a thin, breathless gasp. Her knees grew weak and she fell to the floor, the phone pressed against her ear. 

	“Detained,” she whispered in a shaking voice, she looked at me, “Papa… ICE.” 

Lucia stood frozen, peeking her head out the hallway. She knew the seriousness of the situation, and her nightmare came true. Ari clinged to her side, they looked into each other’s eyes, both understanding what had happened. Ari let out a soft whimper.

“It’ll be okay Ari, don’t cry.” Lucia comforted her. 

That night, the silence was too thick to sleep. They would not be able to sleep without 
Papa’s goodnight kiss, reassuring them that they could sleep safe and sound, that he would protect them. Mama cried herself to sleep on the couch. Lucia found an old spiral notebook buried at the back of her backpack. 

She opened it to a fresh page, and began to write. 

Dear Papa, 
I don’t know if you’re ever going to read this, but I need to say something. Because no 
one else is saying anything. Because I fear that if I don’t write it down, I will disappear
just like you did…

`	The next day, we found out that he was detained because he was driving with a broken taillight. He was stopped by a police officer who was conducting his regular patrol. Papa was able to provide everything except his driver's license. He did not have one. He was immediately arrested, and taken to the sheriff's office where they ran a background check on him. They found out he was an undocumented immigrant, and planned to deport him next week. 

	The house felt lifeless without Papa. Lucia’s mother had to get a second job to be able to provide for her kids, despite her working a minimum wage job as is. She was able to pick up a housecleaning job in the town nearby. Ari, being the youngest one in the household and the one that is bound to be more affected by such an event, changed emotionally. She would oftentimes skip breakfast and would sleep in Lucia’s bed. 

	Being a responsible teenager, Lucia knew that she had to help out her mama in some way. She took over cooking. She would make her mom lunch early in the morning before she went to work. She worked in the morning from 5 a.m. - 3 p.m. then in the evening from 5 p.m. to 11 a.m. 

	Lucia also helped her little sister with her homework. They wanted to pretend everything was back to normal. But they knew it would never be the same without papa. 

	Lucia’s mom came back later than usual that night.

	“Busy today, mom?” she asked, 

	“Yes.” she replied in a monotone voice, 
	
	They all sat at the table, it was quiet, a quietness Lucia had never heard before. No chatter, no radio playing in the background, no sizzling of food. Just the ticking clock above the fridge, marking each second since the world changed. 

	Ari sat at the table, laying her head on the table. Her hair glittered like stars under the chandelier. Their mother staring out the window, the coffee Lucia made for her was untouched. 

	Lucia tried to speak, but nothing came out. Her throat felt like it had been stitched shut. 

	“You guys should probably go to sleep. You have school tomorrow, Lucia.” their mother said,

	“I still have to make your lunch before you leave for work tomorrow.” said Lucia,

	“Don’t worry, I took tomorrow off.” her mother said, attempting to smile, 

	Ari was fast asleep, she was exhausted. As for Lucia, she laid awake, thinking about her father, hoping, praying that he was okay. Before she knew it, it was morning already. The sun was nowhere to be seen, the smell of rain filled the air. 

	Lucia woke up early to prepare breakfast, but to her surprise, her plate was in the microwave. Her mother, once again, is sleeping on the couch in the living room. Lucia heated her plate beep beep beep, each beep slower than the last. She ate breakfast, went to the bedroom she shared with Ari, and patted her forehead. 

	“I’ll be back soon, please help mom out, okay?” Lucia said, 

	Ari did not reply, but she gave her a soft head nod. 

	With that, she headed to the bus stop. Rain stained the streets, and the smell of wet grass filled her lungs, and the cloudy weather reflected what she was feeling inside. 
	The bus ride to school was slow. Lucia looked out the window the entire time, rain drops slowly dripping down the window. If you were a pedestrian outside, it might even look as if Lucia was crying, which is what she wanted to do more than anything. 

	At school, she could not concentrate. The words on the whiteboard blurred together. She kept her head down, pretending to be writing. She tried to tune everything out, the laughter, the chatter, the sounds of pencils writing away, the careless joy of people who did not have to wonder if their father would ever walk through the door again. 

	No one asked where Papa was. 
	No one knew. 
	And she did not want to be the one to tell them. 

	That night, after putting Ari to bed and helping her mother fold laundry in silence, Lucia hopped on her bed at the corner of the room. She then caught a glimpse of a shiny item, the pencil led peeking from the notebook. She grabbed the notebook once more. The red cover was peeling, the spiral bent. It reminded her of school, the smell of old pencils and library books. 

	She turned to the next blank page.

	The pencil hovered over the page for a long time, creating a cinematic pause in time. 

	And then, it moved. 

	Dear Papa, 
	Today was awfully quiet. Too quiet. Mama did not talk much. Ari didn’t cry. I think she is 
	trying to be strong, just like you always told her to be. I am too. But I don’t know how. 

	I hate that no one at school knows. That I can’t just stand up and say it. That if I do, 
	they’ll look at me like I’m something broken. Or worse, like I am something illegal. 

	I hate that word. Illegal. You’re not illegal. You’re my father. You’re kind and good, you 
	work harder than anyone. You taught me to ride my bike and how to draw a bird in one 
	line. You eased our worries at night, when we were afraid of the monsters under our bed. 
	In truth, the monsters are people. They act as if you’re a threat for trying to provide for 
	your family. If that’s so wrong, then are we not all criminals? 

	They took you like you were nothing. But you are everything. 

	Love, Lucia

	She put the pencil back in the notebook, using it as a bookmark where she left off. Her hands trembled, she pressed the notebook to her chest, and let the tears come. This time, she didn’t stop them. 

	The next night, she wrote again. 
	And the next after that. 

	Each letter seemed like a whisper into the void. But they helped her cope, each letter helped her breath a little bit easier. 

	She never sent them, she couldn’t. But she did hide them under her bed. A secret place. A paper trail of pain and love. 

	A place where her voice could live, even if Papa was not there to hear it.
