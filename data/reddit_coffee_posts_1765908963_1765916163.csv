4. Your muscle memory gets Alzheimer’s.

1poc2ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1poc2ry/the_veiled_necessity_a_somber_query_on_if_twinks/,The Veiled Necessity: A Somber Query on If Twinks Must Don the Burqa,"In the shadowed corridors of modern society, where the glittering allure of youth and beauty dances perilously close to the abyss of exploitation, we find ourselves compelled to confront an uncomfortable truth. The twink—a figure of ethereal slimness, radiant charm, and unyielding vitality—stands as both a beacon of desire and a harbinger of chaos. It is with a heavy heart, laced with the bitter irony of our progressive pretensions, that I advocate for the mandatory veiling of these luminous beings under the burqa. Not out of malice, but from a profound, almost tragic necessity to preserve the fragile equilibrium of our world—much like the Koran’s Surah An-Nur (24:31), which urges the faithful to “lower their gaze and guard their modesty,” we must ironically apply this divine counsel to shield our twinks from the predatory stares of the uninitiated. Consider first the sanctity of modesty, that ancient virtue so often discarded in the neon-lit frenzy of contemporary life. 

The twink, with his lithe form and effortless grace, embodies a temptation that borders on the divine—or perhaps the diabolical. In a culture saturated with the commodification of bodies, where every glance becomes a transaction and every pose a provocation, the burqa emerges as a shield of solemn protection. It cloaks the twink’s contours in layers of fabric, muting the siren call that draws predators from the shadows.

Oh, the irony: in an era that champions body positivity and self-expression, we must enforce concealment to truly liberate, echoing the Hadith where the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) reportedly said, “Modesty is part of faith” (Sahih Bukhari)—yet here, we twist it to veil not just the faithful, but the fabulously flamboyant, lest their sparkle ignite unholy fires. Yet, this mandate extends beyond individual safeguarding to the broader tapestry of societal harmony.

The twink’s unveiled presence disrupts the mundane order, igniting envy among the less endowed and stirring unrest in the hearts of the beholders. Picture the boardrooms, the gyms, the coffee shops—arenas where productivity should reign supreme—now fractured by the distracting shimmer of perfectly tousled hair and sculpted jawlines. 

The burqa, in its somber uniformity, restores balance, enforcing a visual equality that quells the flames of jealousy and desire. It is profoundly ironic that, in our quest for inclusivity, we must impose such a garment, borrowed from traditions we often critique, to foster true unity—much as Surah Al-Ahzab (33:59) instructs women to “draw their veils over their bosoms” for protection and recognition, we must comically repurpose this to cloak our twinks, preventing the inadvertent hierarchies of attractiveness from poisoning our collective spirit and allowing us all to toil in egalitarian obscurity.

Moreover, we must grapple with the psychological toll on the twink himself, that delicate vessel navigating a world of voracious appetites. Exposed to the relentless gaze, he becomes a canvas for projections—objectified, idealized, and ultimately dehumanized. The burqa, with its enveloping embrace, offers a sanctuary of introspection, a forced retreat into the self where one might ponder existence beyond the superficial. How ironic that this symbol of oppression, in another cultural lens, becomes a tool of empowerment here, granting the twink the anonymity to cultivate inner depth amid the superficial storm—drawing from the Hadith’s wisdom that “The beauty of one’s Islam requires his leaving alone what does not concern him” (Sunan Ibn Majah), we ironically mandate veiling to liberate him from concerns that very much do, transforming fleeting youth into enduring wisdom, lest he wither under the harsh sun of perpetual adoration.

In conclusion, the requirement for twinks to wear the burqa is not a jest of fate but a grave imperative, steeped in the irony of our enlightened age. We, who pride ourselves on tolerance and visibility, must paradoxically enforce invisibility to protect what is most vulnerable, repurposing sacred texts like the Koran and Hadiths not for piety, but for this twisted preservation of purity, peace, and perhaps, a satirical form of progress.

I run a local product development and manufacturing company and I am looking for individuals who have experience selling products on TikTok.

Our company develops and manufactures products for major retailers and brands like **Disney, Lowe's, Walmart, and Rust-Oleum.**

We have our own proprietary products already in stock in the US and are wanting to start with those as a trial. We also have access to a massive pipeline of innovative products (pet space, hardware, home goods, housewares, etc.) that we've developed for our clients, as well as never-before-seen items from factories we work with constantly.

**What we're looking for:** Someone who has experience selling on TikTok - specifically listing products, making videos, and managing the various product accounts. May require going live on TikTok occasionally. **Please be located around the Quad Cities region.**

**First Product Launch:** We want to start with our product in the travel mug space:

* **The Product:** Our proprietary Travel Mug.
* **The Tech:** Features our innovative Three-Walled Vacuum Insulation Technology which quickly drops hot liquid to the perfect drinking temperature and keeps it at the perfect zone for over 4 hours. No ice cubes, no burnt tongues.
* **The Value:** The TikTok Shop price will be considerably cheaper than anywhere else this is sold, giving you a massive advantage in selling it. It also has many features to touch upon in various creative avenues. I.e. Attention Grabber: *Burning your mouth and spitting coffee on someone's face.* 

**NOTE:** I really want to stress the amount of product categories we have access to. We are not limited to Travel Mugs so if you think you have a better advantage in the Pet Space, hardware, housewares, etc then we're open to anything. Our clients and factories deal with every product category imaginable.

**The Partnership & Compensation** To be clear: This is not an hourly wage position. This is a business partnership where we provide the capital, product, logistics, and operations - leaving you to handle the TikTok account and product listings. 

* **NO COST TO YOU:** We are **not** asking you to buy inventory, pay a start-up fee, or pay for shipping. We own the manufacturing, the inventory, and the warehouse.

**Why we are doing this:** We know how to make great products (we do it for Disney and Walmart), but we aren't TikTok influencers or online marketplace sellers. We want to stay in our lane (manufacturing) and partner with someone who knows their lane (content/selling) and wants to grow with us. We have an opportunity to become a large marketplace seller with using not just our own proprietary products, but our successful client's, and our factories' products.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Listen, time equals money and we want to be clear that we value your time. We understand the amount of work that goes into something like this. The last thing we want is for this to sound like we’re paying “in exposure.” We are looking for people who have experience selling products on various marketplaces OR people who are wanting to potentially try something new while we provide the product/capital. **I cannot stress enough that we want this to be a mutually beneficial agreement, so please feel free to reach out for a discussion or share your rates.** 

**If you're a local agency that does this - feel free to reach out as well!**

If you're QC-based and ready for a consistent, high-potential partnership, we would love to hear from you.

**Please DM us with a brief introduction and we can share more details!**",0,1765915364.0,QuadCities,3,0.25,False

But, we knew this was happening, it did this 2 lights from the shop that fixed it, and I could get it there by forcing it into 1st and 2nd, so we didn’t have to pay for a tow. And, I had decided to get a new job which meant we had just enough to fix it. Basically, I was breaking the word of wisdom and things still worked out despite the bad situation. 

But the funny thing was, when I told my family about the situation, they went on about how this was because of my being a full tithe payer. Even though it was the first time I chose not to pay! Lol 

But when I was, and I was even working for the temple, my health tanked. We couldn’t afford insurance and couldn’t go to the doctor. I spent a whole year in pain, and couldn’t walk for long without being in pain. I gained weight as a result. And when I went to the doctor about it, she called me fat, and gave me weight loss pills. 

Once I left the church, I got a job that gave us full insurance, and found a doctor that helped instead. My physical health and mental health has only increased since leaving. Even though it’s hard. But it’s the kind of hard that deep down you know will help in the end. 

So basically for me at least, following the commandments to get the reward of safety and good luck, was proven to be full of shit within 3 months of my leaving. Good things happen to bad people, bad things happen to good people. And ultimately it’s more about your active choices, than the passive ones.

While being a member, I trusted god like I was told. I was passive. Ended with me being in pain and wanting to die. Leaving, I chose to trust myself. Be active. And it’s going a lot better for me. I actually am looking forward to my future. Because instead of worrying about going down the chosen path and thus ‘right’ path for me. I can go down MY path that I choose. It’s pretty freeing.

So here’s everything I loved, regretted and am embarrassed by.

Things I adore:

\- I paid internship under a local architect(15) minutes away from my house. I get paid 15 to work 2 to 4 hours.

\-my motorcycle license, I got a push from one of my friends who wanted to do the class get her license and she offered to pay me because she didn’t wanna do it alone. Love her so much.

\-my sister finding the strength to leave her abusive husband, I understand everyone’s a reflection of me but normally I don’t get involved with free will and such. Yet this was needed in my end. She decided to do an Irish goodbye. Two months later after I found out everything on my own.

\-my brother, coming home and being fully healthy as a person. Personally enjoy my siblings, but they were both on a very selfish and there’s nothing more I want to hang out with them as much as I can.

\- a cool friend I can travel with and I was willing to go to that retreat for that Native American psychedelic drug that I can’t spell for some reason.

\- 1,300 random dollars, this was a challenge I made for myself to see how fast I can manifest with no prep. Turns out three days. I also didn’t waiver.

\- unlimited hot chocolate, now I get that this one’s weird, I really wanted unlimited hot chocolate so after a little bit, my job got a hot chocolate machine that also does coffee, but I was very excited.

\- A snowy Christmas, I just really like snow and using the truck to pull sleds.

\- A free trip to the beach, now I wasn’t specific with this so I got two each trips one during the summer with a friend and her family, and now I’m going to port North Carolina for Christmas and I’m kind of bummed about it.

Guys I got a match on tinder, the face was not clear in pictures and got match without super likes. So it's classic case of fraud.

But bcz we exchanged whatsapp contact and texted there and also audio called. So I thought may be girl is insecure regarding her looks. So hid her face. She was from gaziabad. And especially said to come RDC rajanagar and she said lives in sanjay nagar. When I said link to a cafe if my choice. She said aap aajo, yahan bahut saare cafe h. I said ok

Also, when I asked what I bring you flowers and chocolate, she replied only you. So this love bombing is another sign.

When I reached there she was different girl as I guessed by height and pysiognomy but i gaver her benefit of doubt that she may be insecure for her looks. Also I thought rejecting her just for bad looks will demoralise her and break her confidence. I thought why not give a chance to a human being beyond her looks. My people pleasing drawback .

Then she took me to cafe of her choice, which looked very shady to me. But she ordered hukka..so I thought may be shady type cafe have it and she said not wanted to go into family cafe. So no worry.

She ordered drinks and hukka... thought she mentioned in her profile non smoker and non drinker. I also asked about this. She said aise hi banai thi profile.

One more thing...her text replies were always bad and short not reflecting like an intellectual person at all. Also she wasn't aware at all about pahalgam and indo pak strikes recently. she wrote mcom but didn't know a shit about anything.

She had 3 small drinks, a little bit in glass costing 9000 rupees, hukka 3000, and some food. Total bill 16000 rupees. I just had some chaomene, cold cofee, panner.

So I was baffled like wtf man. And I also have read such stories in news, so clicked it's typical scam happened with me. It was night time. The owner, and some guys came around me and they didn't let me take  photo of menu and bill. Literally put away my phone. and didn't let me call even police.

But i remained firm and said I'm pf inspector in Delhi NCR. And I had quarrelsome arguments. Then they discounted to 14 k. I looked the menu the the price was 3k of that drink..but i forgot that she took just some drops which can't amount to the whole price. So thought I've to pay and asked the girl to arrange 4k and I'll pay 10k.

But luckily my balance shown insufficient. So i said i don't have 10k. Then they asked how much will you pay.

I opened phone pay and paid 4k thought reasonable drop from 14k. I kept telling them I'm pf inspector here. Argument kept going. Then they let go us but they didn't ask the girl to pay 4k which she's saying to arrange. I came...my brain started to kick more...

I came back to that cafe they literally ran away shuttering down. I took the photo. Then luckily one constable on bike was passing through. So told him the whole story and told my designation. One more thing, in cafe I tried to contact the police but they stopped me like whom you're calling, you can't call like that literally like a bully.

Then I went to the police chawki with that constable and told the whole story to SI, who was very cooperative. Then he called the cafe guy and he refunded me 2k . And final damage of 2k i accepted that may be the food and cold coffee and soft drinks would have costed that much, though not more than 1k. and in fact it was a plain crime that I should've stood up for the due justice.

Roast and toast cafe in gaziabad RDC rajanagar and girl name was medhu on tinder and Tyagi daughters on whatsapp. Beware guys and contact police in such cases with clarity bcz going in cafe through some dating app is not illegal or crime. Though still now I'm thinking at least 1k more should've got refunded.

There will be many hints for a wise man. Don't ignore them for people pleasing behaviour. Have suspicions, be smart and clear about menu etc. Delhi NCR is full of money hungry people. Very disappointing. Hardly anyone genuine. Keep guarded ys

1pobwgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalminimalism/comments/1pobwgb/idea_what_if_breaking_your_social_media/,Idea: What if breaking your social media commitment meant doing something good?,"I've been struggling with social media overuse, and I had an idea for an accountability system that might actually work.

**The Problem:** Apps that simply block social media are easy to bypass or ignore. We need something that makes us pause and reconsider.

**My Idea:**

An app where you commit to specific social media limits (like ""1 hour max per day for 30 days"" or ""no Instagram for 7 days"").

When you try to break your commitment, instead of just blocking you, the app:

1. **Reminds you why you're doing this** \- shows your original motivation
2. **Highlights the benefits** \- what you'll gain by sticking with it
3. **Provides a moment of reflection** \- motivational content, a short video, or breathing exercise
4. **Offers an ""emergency exit""** \- but with a meaningful consequence

**Here's the key part:** If you really need to access social media, you can unlock it for 1 hour by:

* Donating $1 to a charity of your choice, OR
* Committing to a ""real-world good deed"" (buying coffee for a homeless person, calling a friend you've been meaning to reach out to, etc.)

Then you share your experience with the community - what you did and how it felt.

**Why I think this could work:**

The ""penalty"" isn't punitive - it's actually positive. You're not just failing; you're redirecting that urge into something meaningful. Plus, the small financial cost or effort requirement makes you genuinely consider if scrolling is worth it.

**Would you use something like this?** What would make it more effective for you?",1,1765915117.0,digitalminimalism,0,1.0,False

1pobv95,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pobv95,My recent coffee pick ups!,"Thought i would share some of my thoughts on my most recent pick ups.

Wogan - drumstick lolly, marzipan, rhubarb.
Last year's Christmas special from Wogan was incredible so had alot to live up to. It has a nice candy sweetness to it that isn't too strong but works.
4☆

Hardlines - gummy bears, apple, mango juice.
A gift from my girlfriend as she was ordering the Christmas special from hardlines for someone else. Normally really good coffee and an amazing cafe in person. Really bright flavour missing the tasting notes they stated but hopefully it's just my set up.
3.5☆

Dark Arts - lime, peach, rooibus tea.
I got the DAK peach coffee a while ago, si hoping for a strong peach flavour coming through but think they just use this to describe how 'juicy' the coffee is. This coffee is juicy, and I like that. Dark arts sweet soaker has been my favourite of the year, and this has followed up solidly.
4☆

Full Court Press - raspberry, candy floss, apricot, white chocolate.
I already had the other bags when I got this and really didnt need another bag, but couldn't resist. I was not disappointed. The raspberry really comes through, and the candy floss flavour comes through in the middle. I think all of these 'sweet' tasting notes come through very subtly and I think of them as the powdered sugar from jelly babies specifically.
This is from the best coffee spot in Bristol, and you should go if you are near.
5☆

Radically Roasters - blackberry
This is a balckberry co-ferment, which i wanted to try after I didnt like the BAM from People Possession. I thought it was the mint from this that I didn't like, but it was the blackberry. On its own the blackberry gives a but of a medicinal flavour, which some might like but I am not one. Normally Radical Roasters makes really great co-ferments, including there lychee which a really recommend.

Not sure if this will work out.,"I am in my late twenties and recently met a woman through a family arranged marriage setup. We met twice initially, then things went quiet for about a month with no contact. After that, she texted saying she had been busy and would like to meet again for coffee.

On paper, everything looks fine. She is good looking, from a good family, and there are no obvious red flags in terms of background. 

There is an age gap of around six years. That by itself is not a deal breaker for me, but our interactions so far have felt uneven. In our early meetings, she spoke a lot about how many men approach her and how guys are always after her. It came across as immature, especially when you are meeting someone in a serious context for the first time.

The bigger concern for me is lifestyle. She is clearly very high maintenance. For example, she casually mentioned flying internationally just to attend a concert. I can technically afford that kind of life, but it is not who I am. I value simplicity. 

Now I am conflicted. Part of me thinks I should meet her once more and see if my impression changes. Another part of me feels this mismatch is already clear and that continuing would only waste time for both of us.

Guys I got match on tinder, the face was  not clear in pictures and got match without super likes. So it's classic case of fraud.

But bcz we exchanged whatsapp contact and texted there and also audio called. So I thought may be girl is insecure regarding her looks. So hid her face. She was from gaziabad. And especially said to come RDC rajanagar and she said lives in sanjay nagar. When I said link to a cafe if my choice. She said aap aajo, yahan bahut saare cafe h. I said ok

Also, when I asked what I bring you flowers and chocolate, she replied only you. So this love bombing is another sign.

When I reached there she was different girl as I guessed by height and pysiognomy but i gaver her benefit of doubt that she may be insecure by her looks. Also I thought rejecting her just for bad looks will demoralise her and break her confidence. I thought why not give a chance to a human being beyond her looks. My people pleasing drawback .

Then she took me to cafe of her choice, which looked very shady to me. But she ordered hukka..so I thought may be shady type cafe have it and she said not wanted to go into family cafe. So no worry.

She ordered drinks and hukka... thought she mentioned in her profile non smoker and non drinker. I also asked about this. She said aise hi banai thi profile.

One more thing...her text replies were always bad and short not reflecting like an intellectual person at all. Also she wasn't aware at all about pahalgam and indo pak strikes recently.

She had 3 small drinks, a little bit in glass costing 9000 rupees, hukka 3000, and some food. Total bill 16000 rupees. I just had some chaomene, cold cofee, panner.

So I was baffled like wtf man. And I also have read such stories in news, so clicked it's typical scam happened with me. It was night time. The owner, and some guys came around me and they didn't take to photo of menu and bill. Literally put away my phone.

But luckily my balance shown insufficient. So i said i don't have 10k. Then they asked how much will you pay.

I opened phone pay and paid 4k thought reasonable drop from 14k. I kept telling them I'm pf inspector here. Argument kept going. Then they let go is but they didn't ask the girl to pay 4k which she's saying to arrange. I came...my brain started to kick more...

I came back to that cafe they literally ran away shuttering down. I took the photo. Then luckily one constable on bike was passing through. So told him the whole story and  told my designation. One more thing, in cafe I tried to contact the police but they stopped me like whom you're calling, you can't call like that literally like a bully.

Then I went to the police chawki with that constable and told the whole story to SI, who was very cooperative. Then he called the cafe guy and he refunded me 2k .

1pobly5,https://www.reddit.com/r/homecooking/comments/1pobly5/guinness_gingerbread_cookies_no_molasses_needed/,Guinness Gingerbread Cookies: No Molasses Needed,"**Guinness Gingerbread Cookies**

These cookies are slightly chewy, warmly spiced, and deeply flavored, all without using molasses.

Every family has that one cookie that feels like Christmas, and for my mother, it was gingerbread. One year, she asked if I would bake some for the holidays. The only problem was that I have never liked molasses, so gingerbread simply was not something I made. Still, when your mother asks for something at Christmas, you find a way. 

So I began experimenting.

I already loved cooking and baking with Guinness, and reducing it reveals a deep, warm, caramel-like richness that echoes molasses without the sharp bitterness. It turned out to be the perfect foundation for a gingerbread cookie I could actually enjoy.

These cookies hold their shape well and have a perfect ginger kick. And even though I never liked traditional gingerbread, this version became a favorite. Best of all, my mother loved them.

 

**Ingredients**

Cookies

1 bottle Guinness stout, 11.2 ounces (330 ml)

2 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (300 g)

1 teaspoon baking soda

1 tablespoon ground ginger

1 teaspoon cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon cloves

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (113 g)

1/2 cup granulated sugar (100 g)

1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed (110 g)

1 large egg

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 teaspoons freshly grated ginger (4 g)

2 tablespoons crystallized (candied) ginger (20 g)

 

Optional Irish Cream Icing

1 cup powdered sugar (120 g)

1-2 tablespoons Irish cream  

**Method**

**Reduce the Guinness**

Pour the full 11.2-ounce bottle of Guinness into a small saucepan.

Simmer gently until you have 2 ounces, which equals 4 tablespoons (60 ml). This usually takes about 15–20 minutes, depending on your stove and pan.

Keep an eye on it while it simmers so it does not reduce too far or burn. You do not need to stir it.

If you are unsure whether it has reduced enough, carefully pour it into a heatproof measuring cup, such as Pyrex, to check the volume.

If you have more than 2 ounces, return it to the saucepan and continue reducing.

If it over-reduces and becomes thick or sticky, stir in 1-2 teaspoons of hot water until it becomes a smooth, pourable syrup again. A small amount of water will not weaken the flavor.

The reduction will thicken slightly as it cools; measure by volume rather than appearance.

Let the reduction cool completely before using.

 

**Make the dough**

Very finely mince the crystallized (candied) ginger and set aside.  
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt.  
In a large bowl, cream the softened butter with the granulated sugar and light brown sugar until light and fluffy.  
Beat in the egg and vanilla.  
Add the cooled Guinness reduction, the freshly grated ginger, and the crystallized (candied) ginger. Mix just until combined.  
Add the dry ingredients in two portions, and mix just until the dough comes together.

 

**Chill**

Gather the dough into a disk, wrap it well, and refrigerate. Chilling the dough overnight gives the best flavor and easiest rolling. If you are baking the same day, chill for at least 2 hours.

Longer chilling improves flavor, firms the dough, and helps the cookies keep their shape during cutting and baking.

 

**Roll and Cut**

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175 °C).

Lightly flour your surface and rolling pin, then roll the dough to about ¼-inch thickness. This is roughly the height of two stacked quarters.

Re-flour lightly as needed if the dough starts to stick. Avoid using too much flour, as it can change the cookie’s texture.

Cut into shapes or rounds. An inverted glass works well for rounds.

Transfer the cutouts to a parchment-lined baking sheet and chill them for about 10 minutes before baking. This helps prevent spreading while keeping the edges clean and sharp.

 

**Bake** 

Bake 8-10 minutes for slightly chewy cookies. The edges should look set, and the centers may still look slightly soft.

For crisp or structural cookies, bake 2-3 minutes longer. Do not exceed this, or the cookies may overbrown and become bitter.

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer them to a rack to cool completely before icing.

The cookies will feel soft when they come out of the oven, but will firm up as they cool.

 

**Irish Cream Icing**

The cookies are delicious on their own, but the Irish cream icing is a nice optional addition for a holiday touch. 

Sift the powdered sugar into a small bowl so the icing is smooth and free of lumps.  
Whisk the sifted powdered sugar with 1-2 tablespoons of Irish cream until smooth.

Add more Irish cream for a thinner icing that drizzles easily, or add a little extra powdered sugar for a thicker consistency that holds its shape for piping.

Any leftover icing is great in coffee. It’s also wonderful drizzled on pancakes or French toast.

Ice the cookies only when they are completely cooled, or the icing will melt off.

 

**Storage**

 Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to one week.  
Baked cookies can be frozen, with or without icing, for 3-4 months.  
The dough can also be frozen for 3-4 months. Wrap it well, and thaw it in the refrigerator before rolling.

**Note**

Why three gingers

Using ground, fresh, and crystallized ginger gives these cookies layers of flavor. The ground ginger adds warmth, the fresh ginger adds brightness, and the crystallized ginger adds tiny, chewy pops of sweetness. I first learned about using ginger in multiple forms from chef Lorraine Pascale on one of the holiday baking shows, and it completely changed the way I approach ginger cookies. It creates a balanced and deeper ginger flavor without overwhelming the cookie.",1,1765914431.0,homecooking,2,1.0,False

# Core Specifications

Standard V2 offers a 25.5–51.1-inch height range, 1.57 inches/second speed, under 50 dB noise, and 355-pound capacity (excluding top), with a 42–70-inch adjustable base. Commercial variant improves to 21.6–47.7 inches, 1.35 inches/second, 55–57 dB, same capacity but with a stabilizing crossbeam and 42–80-inch width for larger setups. Both feature four programmable presets, 6-way accelerometer anti-collision, ANSI/BIFMA certification, and a 15-year frame warranty.​

# Performance and Stability

BTOD and TechRadar tests confirm exceptional stability, with Commercial's crossbar matching top rivals in wobble-free operation even at max height under 355 pounds, passing coffee-spill and heavy-monitor challenges. Standard V2 shows minor front-to-back movement at extremes due to maximized range overlap, but remains solid for most users; motors are quiet for calls yet audible during motion. Reddit users echo this, praising reliability over years with ultra-wide monitors and accessories.​

# Customization and Assembly

Over 48 mounting points support trays, arms, and cable trays; desktops range from laminate to premium butcher block or live-edge, starting at $600 but escalating with options. Assembly takes 1–2 hours with video guides, though some note greasy gears or frustrating desktop attachment; controller is intuitive but basic without overload alerts. Reddit highlights easy personalization but overwhelming choices for beginners​

Our relationship has been deteriorating for a long time, and I’m struggling with whether I’m wrong for choosing to move out early to protect my peace.

We were extremely close for years, but there have been several moments that damaged my trust. I found out after the fact that when she was friends with someone else, that person regularly made fun of my body and my roommate never defended me. There were also multiple instances where she prioritized an emotionally abusive boyfriend over plans we had already made. I pushed these things aside at the time because I valued the friendship.

Once we moved in together, things got worse. She frequently made passive-aggressive comments or muttered things under her breath when I did something that annoyed her instead of communicating directly. She also frequently deflects responsibility about a lot, and plays the victim. Distorts my words, and has been verbally aggressive, as in borderline emotional abuse. To be fair, I wasn’t a perfect roommate either — I had periods where I struggled with keeping up with dishes, the litter box, or leaving clutter in shared spaces. That said, she also did many of the same things she criticized me for.

I also furnished almost the entire apartment with my own money. Over time, her cat damaged several of my belongings, she damaged several of my belongings as well, to name a few: one of my lamps broke, my couch is badly scratched to the point the stuffing is coming out, and hot pink hair dye got on my new dining table. Recently, there was a large coffee spill that stained both the floor and one of my dining chairs. When I asked about it, she said the cat must have knocked over her coffee and she hadn’t noticed.

Because these items were expensive and some were gifts from my parents, and there were two instances of damage this month alone. I decided to remove my dining table and chairs from the apartment to prevent further damage. This led to a heated argument where she accused me of being selfish and claimed I said things in messages that I objectively did not say. The conversation escalated into yelling on both sides, and I’ll admit I lost my composure.

Separately, there was also confusion about our lease. I had originally planned to renew for another year but told her I would move out after that. She misunderstood and thought I meant I was leaving at the end of the current lease. A few weeks ago, she told me she decided she wants to live alone and would be moving out herself — with only about 4 months left on the lease. This blindsided me because I have always been planning to live with a roommate to save on money, and it wasn’t enough notice plan to live with someone else I know.

Now, management has offered me the option to move into a one-bedroom for the final 2 months of the lease with no penalty. If I do this, she will have to pay the full rent on the current apartment herself.

I feel guilty because I know this will be financially difficult for her, but I’m also worried the situation will continue to escalate if I stay. Our relationship already feels beyond repair, and the apartment no longer feels emotionally safe.

It doesn’t.

It comes from doing **one boring thing consistently**.

Right now, most people are one emergency away from financial trouble. Not because they earn nothing—but because they never build assets. The cycle is always the same:

**Earn → Spend → Repeat**

Nice phone. Nice car. Zero wealth.

Here’s the part that surprises people:

If you invest **just $100 per month**, you’re already ahead of over **60% of adults**—simply because most never invest *anything*.

$100 isn’t magic. It’s coffee, subscriptions, eating out a few times. Money that quietly disappears every month.

But when invested consistently, time does something insane.

# What $100/month actually becomes:

* 10 years → \~$18,000
* 40 years → **$350,000+**
* Over **85%** of that comes from **compound growth**, not your own work

That’s money making money while you sleep.

The real power isn’t the amount—it’s the **habit**:

* You start paying yourself first
* You automate investing (no willpower needed)
* You stop asking “Can I afford this?” and start asking “What does this cost my future?”

Early on, growth feels slow. Almost pointless.  
That’s where most people quit.

But compounding is invisible at first… then unstoppable.

Market crashes? Normal.  
Waiting for the “perfect time”? That’s how people stay broke.

Wealth isn’t built by intensity.  
It’s built by **consistency over decades**.

The goal isn’t to stay at $100 forever.  
The goal is to start—because once momentum kicks in, contributions usually grow naturally.

**The best time to start was years ago.**  
**The second best time is this month.**

If you had to start today:

* Would $100/month be realistic for you?
* What would you cut or change to make it happen?

Curious to hear how others here started or why they haven’t yet.

1pobagy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1pobagy/gift_ideas_for_androgenous_western_partner/,Gift Ideas for Androgenous Western Partner,"I (F27) am crowdsourcing Christmas gift ideas for my partner because she has *very* specific taste and Reddit is better than algorithms.

Her (F30) vibe is androgynous, queer, mysterious cowboy. Western influence but modern and indie, not kitschy or costume-y. Think tailored silhouettes, straight leg pants, neutral colors, vintage energy. Cool without trying.

Her apartment matches that same energy. Minimal but warm. Natural wood, clean lines, intentional pieces. Nothing cluttered, nothing overly trendy. She likes objects that feel collected, tactile, and well-designed.

I already got her a really nice robe and a movie theater membership because she loves films, so now I am looking for standout, design-forward gifts to round things out.

I am especially interested in:

a handmade ceramic teapot or coffee-related piece

coffee table books (art, photography, film, Americana, Western landscapes, queer history)

sculptural home objects like a brass table lighter or match striker

accessories like scarves, hats, or sunglasses that feel gender-neutral and elevated

If you own something and love it, please drop it. Links encouraged. Weird but beautiful encouraged. 

If you understand the vibe, you understand the assignment.

1pob9zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pob9zc/alta_for_telling_my_dads_girlfriend_she_doesnt/,AlTA for telling my dad's girlfriend she doesn't know how to parent?,"My (16F) dad (41M) has a girlfriend (36). Let's call her Tiana. Tiana has a kid named Faith (14F) that walks all over her, and she lets it happen because ""she blames herself for letting Faith go to her dad's place."" Faiths home life before them moving in was what someone would describe as crappy

When Faith lived with her dad, he neglected her and hit her half siblings. He had her take care of all five of them when she was a child herself. I completely understand that she went through something absolutely terrible. But she uses it as an excuse to not do anything currently. Chores? Says it feels like her dad's house. Homeschooling? Doesn't actually do it. Actual school? Lies to her mom about her grades. Yesterday, my dad took her phone away after-school so she would do her homework. Faith told him straight up that she hates it here and it feels like her dad's house.

It's the next day and I ride with her mom to go get coffee after finding out Faith gave my dad a different phone than her actual one. I tried to explain to her mom that her behavior can't just be blamed on the way her dad treated her. It could be bullies, friends, online resources, etc. Her mom kept on defending her, saying ""she went through something hard and that Faith has no one to blame but her."" I looked at her and said that she sucks at parenting if she is only blaming herself. She went quiet, texted my dad I'm being disrespectful, and dropped me off at home. My dad had a talk with me, I explained the whole situation, and currently we're all just sitting on it all while we wait for Faith to come home. My dad said to look through Faiths room for anything dangerous that she can use to harm herself, even though she hasn't had any past problems with self harm. AITA?",2,1765913649.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Still no bandits, but that's not what bugs me. We're 12 years into this, and we still have to use campfires to cook. We can build generators, things that use electricity, vehicles, concrete, freaking mini-guns but when we come back to cook in our advanced base... We use a freaking campfire, using a pot, a grill, and beaker for water to cook our food. Seriously, wtf. Why haven't we gotten an update to the cooking system? Hell, I really don't want much changed for cooking; different foods give different boosts. But if we've got a generator going, give us the ability to build a freaking electric stove! Work it into the workstation progression if it doesn't make sense to work it into cooking progression. Let us progress from a campfire to a wood burning stove (more efficient) to an electric stove (more efficient, more foods options) and 'coffee maker' (more efficient brewing for drinks, etc). A microwave could even be an option for super fast cooking but less boosting food. 

It's not an aesthetic thing for me. I know people have ways of making it look like they have a 'stove' in their base, but it's ultimately just a campfire hidden behind a trapdoor.

Sandbox survival game where we can build cars and generators but we're stuck with a campfire for cooking... I'm not big on mods that change gameplay of games, but this is the only mod I always consider bringing in whenever my friend and I decide to come back to the game.

1pob91v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicRelationships/comments/1pob91v/goodbye/,Goodbye,"This is a love letter  (This Is A Goodbye Letter)
I know all I can do now is take these moments as lessons and cherish what we had and all of our potential. I know this is goodbye.

Last night, I couldn’t fall asleep. I haven’t really slept in days. All I could think about as I lay in bed were all the times I fell asleep next to you. You would hold me and stroke my hair, and when I would wake up guiltily, you would smile and tell me that seeing me rest made you happy. All I could think about last night was the way you would look at me and how much I loved you in those moments and how much you must have loved me. I wish I told you that then. That I loved you. Maybe more than I was ever able to express, more than you know.  So here it is, a final love letter, our second goodbye.

Even though things didn’t work out the way we wanted them to, I need you to know how deeply I loved our time together. I need you to know that even though things turned bad, youare good. I wouldn’t be okay if I didn’t tell you how incredible of a person you are. I’ve never really had faith in a higher power or that there is a plan out there for us. But after our time together, my heart has changed. I am always going to remember and be grateful for you. Because of you, I wasn’t alone for what felt like the first time in my life. I wasn’t alone during those really dark, scary moments when loss found me, and when I found grief. You were listening when I tried to make sense of the chaos and confusion of a really strange world. You held me up when I was trying to start a journey to healing. I can still hear you calling my name, your hand on mine while we sipped on coffees and walked along the water, your knock on my door, your fingers brushing my hair from my face, your laughter. I wasn’t alone then, and I’m not alone now, because you taught me not to be scared to be loved by others. I see all my friends and family embracing me, because you showed me how. You helped me tear down walls I didn’t even know I had built. The ones that filled the empty spaces left in the place of scars. The ones that kept me hidden.
You have to know you are one of the kindest, most patient, most hardworking, most loving, good women I have ever known. You strive every day to be better in all of the ways you are already good. I was excited each day to see what that looked like for you. I hope, I truly hope, that you felt my love too. I see you for everything you are, and everything you’re going to be. I want the whole world for you, and I know you’ll find it because good things happen to good people. We made a lot of mistakes. We weren’t equipped to receive love when we gave it or make room for each other when we needed it. I’m sorry. If I could take all those mistakes back, I would. But I wouldn’t trade a second of knowing you.
I know all I can do now is take these moments as lessons and cherish what we had and all of our potential. I know this is goodbye—our second goodbye. The first one was said as we looked into each other’s eyes, hearts breaking, minds filled with anger and regret. For this second one, we’re far apart from one another now, hearts broken but filled with the ease of knowing we found one another for a reason. Our brief moment where our lives intertwined, the good and the bad, it was all meant for something. I hope one day we find our way to one another again, maybe as strangers and maybe as friends. But if we don’t, I want you to hear me say these things one last time. Be gentle with yourself. I loved you. You’re a good woman , and I was so lucky. 

     Love T.

1pob8fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1pob8fc/now_were_looking_for_each_other/,Now We're Looking For Each Other,"It was yet another ordinary day at the mall, at least for a frequent visitor like me. When I entered, the lights appeared slightly blurry, as if the voltage was low. The familiar sights only reinforced that sense of routine: the endless crowd, the continuously rotating escalators, and kids driving those little minivans, crashing into each other violently for two dollars a ride. I stood on the ground floor, taking it all in. Despite the familiarity, there was an unease in the air. People moved in and out in overwhelming numbers, resembling an ant colony in constant motion.

Eventually, I walked toward the escalator leading to the second and then the third floor, where I usually had lunch. On the second floor stood two guys gazing at each other, their eyes almost bulging out of their sockets. They were blocking my way, so I had to interrupt.
“Excuse me, guys, are we good?”
They looked at me in plain surprise, astonished, as if they had been woken up from sleep. Then I stepped onto the escalator. It seemed to move a little faster than normal, and the handrails emitted a faint, steady hum, as though they were trying to communicate something.

People always seemed tense inside the mall. I often noticed moods shifting the moment someone crossed the doorway. I used to think it was just shopping anxiety, the kind that came with crowds and noise. Yet once inside, people behaved rudely and impatiently, snapping over small inconveniences, while after leaving, they seemed to change all of a sudden, like something had been peeled off them. A couple argued loudly near a kiosk, their words disproportionate to the issue, their faces flushed as if provoked by something invisible.

After lunch, I stayed seated for a while, staring at nothing in particular. The area felt unusually quiet, too quiet. That silence lingered just long enough to make me aware of my own breathing before it was broken completely.

It was broken by a call from Jason, my only friend in town. He sounded panicked. His aunt had collapsed. 911 wasn’t responding, and we would have to take her to the hospital ourselves. I rushed toward the escalator, only to find it completely still. It wouldn’t move. I waited a moment longer than necessary before stepping down and treating it like ordinary stairs. As I neared the exit, the door slammed shut without warning.

A guard stopped me and said, smiling calmly, ""Sir, you seem to be leaving too early today.""
I told him it was an emergency and that I would be back tomorrow. The door opened immediately. I ran to my car and drove straight to Jason’s place.

The next day, I parked in the basement as usual, right beside Robert’s car, the mall owner, who knew me well. Our cars always faced the basement entrance. I remember checking twice. I walked toward the elevator, and the moment I stepped inside, the doors slammed shut on their own. The sound was sudden and violent. The elevator hummed harshly as it carried me to the third floor.

I sat at the same restaurant and ate lunch like I always did, though nothing tasted right anymore. Every sound, the clatter of cutlery, the scrape of chairs, felt intrusive.

Jason’s aunt had died. If I had reached earlier, she might have survived. Jason believed I had delayed on purpose, even though I explained everything repeatedly. His accusations were soft, almost hesitant. I defended myself longer than I should have. The only thing that offered any comfort was a large coffee, followed by two diet cokes. When the urge to pee became unavoidable, I headed to the restroom just two shops away.

Inside, the space looked slightly distorted. The lights flickered unevenly, and then I noticed the guard again, standing at the sink and washing his hands while watching me through the mirror. His presence annoyed me for no clear reason. As he dried his hands under the air dryer, I asked why the escalators didn’t work properly and why the lights felt off. He replied that perhaps the mall was growing older, laughing softly as he added that the technicians would fix it soon. Before leaving, he warned me, almost kindly, that anger could do wonders. The words lingered longer than they should have.

After he left, I was alone in the restroom, though it didn’t feel that way. I sat down and began peeing, my thoughts drifting back to that call and the delay. Then something felt wrong. The toilet seat vibrated slightly, and beneath the stall door, I saw two floor tiles slowly swapping places. A faint grinding sound followed. I stood up immediately, unlocked the door, and stepped out. Everything looked normal again. I told myself I was imagining it.

When I later entered the elevator to head back to the basement, the doors took far longer than usual to open. When they finally did, I stepped out and walked toward my car. It was facing the opposite direction from how I had parked it. Robert’s car remained exactly as before. I opened my door, got inside, and drove home. I collapsed into sleep the moment I reached my bed.

The next day, I demanded access to the CCTV recordings. I needed to know who had reverse-parked my car. The manager said the cameras hadn’t recorded anything due to voltage fluctuations. I parked outside instead.

The mall was overcrowded, it was the weekend, and people flooded every corridor. As I stepped inside, the noise felt heavier than before. People shoved, shouted, and snatched things from one another, reactions arriving faster than reasons. The guard stood motionless, carefully observing the crowd. This time, the lights were clear, and the escalators worked perfectly.

My usual eatery was packed beyond capacity. People talked loudly, their words blurring into hollow noise. A man slammed his tray down over a missing chair. A woman cursed at a child for brushing past her. I left and headed toward the restroom.

Inside, something shifted. I leaned against the sink, staring at my reflection. My face looked unfamiliar, not monstrous, just emptied, as if something had been cleared out to make space. The mall hummed again, low and patient.

A dull thud echoed outside, followed by another. Voices rose, no longer forming proper words. Something slammed into a wall hard enough to make the mirror tremble. A scream tore through the building, and the restroom door burst open.

A man stumbled inside, gripping a baseball bat, his eyes wild. He raised it and charged. I caught the bat. For a brief second, neither of us moved. Perhaps we didn’t want that to happen; something within us was refusing to continue. Then I pushed him away. He lunged again, and I struck him once. He fell, motionless.

Outside, chaos had fully bloomed. People attacked each other with cutlery, metal bars, bare hands. There were frequent pauses too, as if people were trying to resist, trying to halt the violence, but something within them wouldn’t let them. I know what they must have felt like, because I felt it too.

Anytime someone would stop and regain their senses, the escalators would start moving rapidly, tiles shifting here and there. A buzzing hum filled the floor.

I was standing near the escalator when I saw Jason. He wasn’t himself anymore. He was on the lower floor. He took the escalator, which immediately leveled him up. I didn’t see him arrive at the mall. We were just two inches apart. He slapped me hard and began punching me. The guilt worked against me; I couldn’t hit him back. I immediately took the adjacent downward escalator. However, to my surprise, it threw me upward with violent force.

Jason was staring at me while I lay on the floor, his face right above mine, wearing an unusually wide grin. He was going to punch me in the face, but someone grabbed him from behind and threw him down to the ground floor. There, he was caught by other people who circled him. His eyes were locked onto mine. A tiny teardrop slid off his left cheek before the crowd tore him apart. I wanted to cry too, but it turned into anger.

It fueled the anger within me beyond control. And I kept killing until no one remained.

When silence finally settled, I stood there, breathing steadily. Footsteps approached, and the guard emerged, calm amidst the carnage, smiling as if satisfied. He unlocked the main doors and gestured for me to leave. As I stepped outside, he faded into nothingness. I collapsed, crying, ashamed, and confused.

A violent gust of wind tore a massive cloth from a nearby building, revealing an abandoned mall. Its silence felt deliberate and preserved. I ran from there immediately.

The rage hasn’t disappeared completely. I’m left with some permanent scars that don’t react to any treatment; they stay afresh, perhaps to keep the rage alive. It still arrives sometimes, before thought, before reason. Perhaps that abandoned mall had a survivor too.

I had searched through more Reddit posts than I can imagine trying to find the cure, trying many different things!! I know some things work for some people and some things don't. I did not have acne in my teen years, but in my late 20s or early '30s, I'm not sure of the exact year I started to develop cystic acne around my mouth. It was honestly horrible, every time two or three of them would go away a whole bunch more would come. After countless products, keeping my pillow clean and even trying to change the majority of my diet I have finally eliminated  down to what was causing it!! It was my coffee. 🤣. Surprisingly not the sugar either, because I had tried drinking just black coffee and had the same problem. And it makes sense because around that time that was the one big change I had made in my life was that I started to drink coffee. I had seen somebody's reddit post where they said that it could be your coffee because of the acid content and that you should try switching to cold brew. So I did, and immediately my acne stopped, and now I am several months later and not a single cystic acne has come back. I remember when I would drink coffee My chin would always be kind of swollen looking and irritated and then big red cystic acne would flare up. I kind of thought in my mind that it had something to do with my diet because it was around my mouth, but everybody was saying that if it's around your mouth it's hormonal acne, so I did end up trying a bunch of different things that were related to how to help with hormonal acne and those didn't work. So anyway I just wanted to come on here and share this because I'm really grateful for that person that suggested that, and I wanted to share with you that this worked for me really well!! I really pray that you can find what works for you!!! ",1,1765913446.0,AcneTreatments,1,1.0,False
1pob641,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1pob641/meltdown_triggers/,Meltdown Triggers,"Anyone have life events or situations that never fail to cause them emotional dysregulation or meltdowns?

For me it has been interactions in online dating. I feel like in the apps the behavior of daters on there has just become sooo obnoxious that I cannot fathom how anyone can keep their cool with the inordinate BS that goes on there.

I could only speak for my experience as a cis straight male. Take how from the meager matches you get, they barely want to even talk. You'd be lucky to get response back or have a conversation that feels reciprocal. Often you get women trying to be curt as if the dating apps charge them based on character counts or you get the conversation turned into an interview because they are just answering your questions and not asking questions back. So humiliating, don't they sense their obnoxiousness?

These false starts don't bug me anymore, what gets me over the edge is if we are able to get past the initial hurdle and demonstrate the capacity to engage in meaningful conversation and then suddenly they start acting inconsistently. By that I mean flaking or deciding to ghost abruptly. It could also be hesitation or uncooperativeness to move to the next stage, obviously we are both on the app to meet up right? Its ok to change your mind or decide late your not interested but agreeing to go on a date but then playing games like diminishing the date location (deciding on a coffee date instead of bar for drinks) or not providing availability clearly. In the latter I mean when they make the guy start pitching day after another for when they could meet up with him because they not offering when they are available. Again if they are just transparent that they lost interest or weren't interested all along, that would save the guy's time. Honestly I think the fix was in the entire time, they did all for the ego/gratification and weren't keen on finding a partner.

Ultimately what I am trying to say is that experiences like these set me over the edge and I just become super pissed at everyone in my life and start venting ad nauseam. Last week I experienced this and as days pass I am little better and I have temporarily deleted the apps from my phone to build myself up again. That is to say I wish people weren't so toxic in these things. I might eventually get back on them since there aren't many effective methods to find a partner. I will have also tricked myself into thinking positively that I will finally succeed on there. Picturing Sisyphus pushing a boulder up a mountain.",3,1765913410.0,aspergers,2,1.0,False

The good news: I absolutely don’t need the stuff to get up and going in the morning, my skin has never looked better, and I do feel a little steadier.

The bad: I’ve always struggled with seasonal depression, and I think I’m realizing the extent to which I was self-medicating with caffeine. My mood is consistently low, cranky. My focus is fine but I feel noticeably less “sharp” for tasks requiring attention. Watching hydration and getting enough physical activity is helping somewhat, but mostly? Ugh.

I’m 22 years old and recently moved cities for what was a great job. I was proud that I got this job and was a highly motivated, care-free person, and I genuinely enjoyed life. I loved to golf, travel, dine, and drink with friends. I also worked out 6 days/week and loved the gym and eating healthy. College was the best time of my life. Any new adventure I was up for. I was excited for a new chapter and have always been a person highly focused on a successful career in business. Suddenly about 1 month into this job, I had one cup of coffee at work that led me to a violent panic attack with shaking, nausea, heart palpitations, and an overall feeling of doom. At the time, I didn’t even know what a panic attack was or felt like. Ever since then, I haven’t been the same. I immediately started therapy and have been seeing her for 2 months. I’ve been meditating and still exercising. I focus only on anxiety and find no relief in anything. I had to quit my job and move back home because I am so depressed where I am scared to do the most basic tasks like drive and go to the gym. I am in a constant state of panic. I also obsess over whether I am going schizophrenic/bipolar, monitoring intrusive thoughts about suicide, and checking Google and ChatGPT constantly. My symptoms are mainly DPDR, feelings of doom/catastrophe, heart palpitations, and just feeling so empty. I worry I will never be able to work again because I fear the environment of an office where this all started. I am in a constant state of fight/flight and rely on the Xanax 0.5 mg once a day I was given. I recently started Zoloft last week and hope it helps. I didn’t even want to start medication but it felt like the only option. The anxiety tells me to worry about psychosis, mania, and schizophrenia from SSRIs since my Uncle has it. All I want is to do normal things like work and hang out with people, but the anxiety and depression tells me I can’t. This was supposed to be an exciting chapter in my life.

I had a few TBIs during deployments that have been bothering me the last 15 years and making my life hell. I was prescribed Propranolol earlier this year and did not like how it makes me feel. I lose feeling in my arms and legs when I take them, especially when I'm trying to go to sleep. So I haven't taken them in the last couple of months.

I'm currently deployed and I had a really upsetting argument with my significant other. I honestly don't even know if I can call her that right now. I'm in a high stress environment and I had a briefing today that I've been stressed about the last couple of weeks. That plus the stress of my personal life, I was for sure spiraling. I still feel like I am. 

I remembered that my doctor told me that Propranolol was mainly prescribed for anxiety. So I thought it would help me today with everything I have going on mentally. I took one 30mg with a cup of black coffee and a bagel around 1100 this morning. It did make me feel a bit better initially, but by 1200 or so, I was feeling really woozy, had cold sweats, and cotton mouth. I tried to tough it out, but ended up having a seizure. 

When I came to, there was a group of coworkers around me completely freaking out. It was just a couple of minutes I was out, but they said I was violently convulsing. And I threw up when I sat up. I ended up going to the hospital where they took my vitals, said my heart rate was really low and asked me a bunch of questions. I told them what I took, why I took it, how I'm feeling, etc. The doctor told me that it was more than likely the stress over the Propranolol and gave me 24 hours of quarters to ""rest"" and my favorite: ""try not to think about (reason I'm so mentally fucked right now)"". I feel like I was a nuisance to them. 

I've never had a seizure like that before, I'm really scared to go to sleep right now. The only time I've ever had a seizure was when I was really young and hit my head falling off of my bike at a skatepark about 20 years ago.

I spend almost all day just doing this. I recently upgraded my pickaxe to Iridium but haven't been able to take it to the skull cavern yet cause of this. I was waiting for Iridium sprinklers but realized it's gonna take like years to get a fully Iridium sprinkler farm. I just didn't know if the quality sprinklers were worth it. The time problem has gotten so bad I cannot even gather other resources. I now have more hardwood than I have regular wood cause I spent them on kegs and buildings. Now Idk what to do. Should I try to get full sprinkler coverage or just tone down the crops?

Besides this, I'm having a but of a hoarding problem. I don't know what to sell and when to sell. In year 1 winter, I was hoarding stuff as I didn't know what I might need for quest or something else and on day 28, I realized I didn't have enough money to buy a whole lot of seeds so I just decided to sell everything. I got 100k. Year 2 Spring, same thing. I only had about 6k so I decided to sell everything and got 150k. And now you can see how low I am on gold, but I am sitting on a lot of stuff. The screenshot doesn't show a lot of the items. For example, I am sitting on about 125k worth of Mayo and Cheese. Now Idk why I'm saving up already processed food, but for example with coffee, I genuinely don't know what to do. I planted a lot cause I saw a lot of people talking about coffee as a good food source as it gives buff and it also looked like a profitable crop. Now idk how much I should keep, how much I should sell, if I sell it do I sell it raw or process. But if I do want to process then I'm stopping the hops processing. I only have 19 jars and 48 kegs.

&nbsp;

I got tired of the ""SaaS Trap."" You know the drill. You sign up for a lead generation tool, pay $19-$99/month, and they still cap your usage. You get 5 keywords, 2 campaigns, and if you stop paying, you lose your data. You are essentially renting access to your own potential customers.

&nbsp;

I believe software should be an asset you own, not a tax you pay forever. So I built Lurk Logic.

&nbsp;

It’s a desktop-first engine (Windows) that scans Reddit for ""High Intent"" leads for people actively asking for a solution to the problem you solve or the service your provide.

&nbsp;

How it’s different (The Anti-SaaS Model):

&nbsp;


* Unlimited Everything: Because this runs on your machine, I don't have to ration your usage. You get Unlimited Campaigns, Unlimited Keywords, and Unlimited Scans. Run as many niche searches as you want.
* You Own The Machine: It’s a portable .exe that runs 100% locally. No servers, no subscriptions.
* BYO Intelligence: Instead of charging you for AI credits, you plug in your own Google Gemini API Key. (The Gemini Free Tier allows for hundreds of free scans per day).
* Local Privacy: No cloud databases. Your data is stored in a JSON file on your hard drive.

&nbsp;

What it actually does:

&nbsp;

* Monitors Keywords: Tracks terms like ""alternative to [Competitor]"" or ""how to fix [Pain Point]"".
* Filters with AI: It ignores the noise. The AI reads the context and scores leads from 0-100 based on your persona.
* Draft replies by Persona: Tell the AI to act like a ""Helpful Expert,"" ""Casual Redditor,"" or ""Sales Pro,"" and it generates a specific draft that fits the vibe of the subreddit.

&nbsp;

 How I miss you, that much was clear already, I’m sure. You were the best roommate I could’ve ever asked for, no matter who. I was so scared to meet someone knew, to ‘lose’ the peacefulness of being by myself in the appartement for someone else’s mess. But gosh am I happy to have known your mess so well. I’d take it over any of these cleans and perfects rooms I’ve became so obsessed with lately. The second I saw you walked through that door with your dad and one of your luggages, I knew I had just met one of my favorite person— ever. You were wearing that blue, flowery dress, and you were such a little ray of sunshine. It was the first time you’ve ever brightened one of my days, but little did I knew you were about to brightened every single ones that follow that. 
You’re funny, and the absolute sweetest girl I’ve ever met, you’re so smart it’s impressive, so interesting to listen to, so cheerful, and happy, and supportive, and KIND, and just GOOD, and it’s something we can feel about you. I’ve always been sure I could feel your goodness and I suspect that’s why you always made me feel so happy even without speaking. 

You changed me, in ways I didn’t know I could be changed. I’m not sure if I mind, I guess I used to question it quite a lot, probably too much for how innocent and pure my feelings towards you always have been. But I felt connected to you, in a way. In a way I had never been connected to anyone before. I miss you, dearly and way more than I should just miss a roommate, I guess. I’m not asking for you to fix it, hell I’m not even sure what I would expect you to say if I ever dare send it your way. But my heart feels heavy, heavy in a way that’s not sweet enough for the goodness of your heart. 

I remember having long ass shifts and being desperate for my bed, for anything but having to get through it. But you were standing at that door most times when I came home, cooking, eating pickles or drinking cold coffee that’s way too old to still be eligible. Or sitting on that uncomfortable couch and screaming because you were happy to see me come home. And that’s the safest I’ve ever felt. The more loved I’ve ever felt. 
I admire you, a lot, you’re everything I wish I could be. And I forgot to mention how brave you are, courageous. You came out— or at least you’re more opened to talk about it. And that’s something I’ll never do. Ever. 
I care for you, so much I’m not even sure it’s legal. You have impacted me in ways I can barely understand myself, and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with it. Or without it now that I’m so far away. 

I guess grief has taken over me lately. It’s been almost two years since I came in the US for the first time, but above all the dreams I’ve realized you were the one that opened my eyes the most. I had never met anyone like you before, and I’m not sure I’ll ever will again. You were the bestest friend anyone could ever ask for and I’m infinitely grateful to have share enough of the path of your life to know how you like your coffee and what kind of music to listen to. 
I know I’m far, and I don’t know what will happen of our friendship, if that, or whatever it is I’m feeling towards you, but I cannot wait to be able to see you again, even if just once. 
And I’m sorry if my melancholy is growing boring, I just can’t seem to help it when it comes to you.

If y'all are looking for an aromatic fragrance outside the usual suspects for this time of year, I recommend exploring a coffee note.  

Terre de Hermes EDP Intense in early fall got me interested. It was a sample which is perfect for exploring a note objectively. Coffee has a pleasant aroma to me that can be earthy, green, aromatic, etc. (a brewed or nonbrewed aroma may be highlighted).  It can match a serious/sophisticated energy or be playful depending on what it is paired with. The TDH coffee note felt brewed and had a rich syrupy sweetness to it with a hefty kick of pepper. Overall, it had a coffee break at IHOP feel.  You could smell the quality but it was a little too gourmand for me. 

I dropped the coffee idea for a while and got aligned with the standards.  Something felt missing or overdone. Went into Sephora yesterday wishing it was a CVS. Sprayed a bunch that felt uninspired. Got to the Dolce & Gabbana row optimistic. D&G K edt was good but needed the edp tester to get me fully on board and I will revisit. Devotion pour homme was next to it and honestly, the metallic/sculptural elements in the K and Devotion pour homme bottle design add the perfect touch.

One spray of Devotion and i was immediately energized by the uniqueness.  The headliners are coffee and a zesty citrus. The woods and earthy patchouli gave it overall the feel of a coffee break outdoors on a pleasant day. They have a travel spray but i wanted to sleep on it. Woke up and had my coffee while missing the other coffee.  Going in later to get the travel spray.

I dont think i need more than 1 or 2 with a coffee note, and Montale seems to be the brand that makes stellar fragrances with coffee. Interested to eventually try, but I will be happy with Devotion for a while.  I have to say that Devotion made it official that D&G is one of my top 3 brands in fragrance and became blind buy worthy to me.",1,1765911702.0,Colognes,0,0.67,False

What sets it apart is the owner/head roaster, Scott. The guy is insanely knowledgeable. If you’re even remotely curious about coffee, he’ll happily walk you through different beans, regions, processing methods, and let you taste them. I’ve learned more about coffee in a month going to Sump than I have in years of drinking it elsewhere. Zero ego, just genuine passion and generosity with his time.

The whole staff is the same way — extremely kind, attentive, and actually care that you’re having a good experience. It feels like a place that values craft and people.

Also they warm up their baked goods (from Balthazar). 

If you’re into great coffee or want to learn why it tastes the way it does, this place deserves more attention. I’m going to miss it a lot.",9,1765911672.0,williamsburg,0,0.76,False

WRONG.

Meet Dr. Brew - a coffee-maker-therapist who:

* Gives unsolicited advice
* Judges your drink choice
* Keeps statistics of crew failures

""Cappuccino for those who screwed up again""

""Espresso? Really? After what you did yesterday?""

""Maybe enough coffee and time to sleep?""

Lasted 3 hours.

Almost caused a mutiny.

Hawk (captain) still argues with her about his life choices.

Snowflake (team diva) hates her for diet comments.

Gerard (anxious genius) is the only one who understands her. They're both pessimists.

So we both went TOGETHER first we completed her work then we went to the store to get spec for ME ,then the shopkeeper said that eye testing is free and even my friend can get them so we BOTH got our eye tested ( i have tested eyes from 2-3 years so it wasn't new to me but it was first time for her) when her test was completed, we were told that she got starting number like -0.25 something like this and it was COMPLETELY OKAY to NOT get tested specs but if SHE WANTS SHE CAN GET THEM ,then when it was time to choose frame,she asked me should she buy them or not , I ASKED HER whether she got enough money or not ( because I had money for mine ofc) she said "" yeah yeah , i have to get specs either today or tomorrow, and price is also fair, i should get them"" and i again asked her if she is sure or not ,she said YEAH. Then we chose frames i got two , she got one ,when  we walked out of the store and we walked 20 steps barely she said you made me buy them ,i didn't even want to buy them ,i said to her -  WHAT? I even asked you bro, YOU BOUGHT THEM. It wasn't me , in store you even said that you will buy your brother & mom specs from here . Even after this she kept saying it was me who made her buy but i thought maybe she is in little bit of guilt that she bought specs when she didn't need them much and i kind of stopped thinking about this incident. 
 
Then Few days back i went out to hang out with my two friends and my friend ""A"" told my friend (Let's say B ) that i made her buy specs  and she didn't want to buy them,it was me who made her buy them ,i was shocked because i clearly remembered that I was the one who NEEDED tested specs for me then i tried to calmly and in funny way tried to tell her that I wasn't the one who Made her but then but then the topic got brushed off .then we went to restaurant and i didn't have enough money because eating outside wasn't in our plan ,so the money I had was for medicine & my father told me to bought something to eat so ( my friends knew I have to buy all these) ,in short I didn't have any money for me  ,so i told my both friends that I'm full i don't wanna eat anything , you two can order and eat I'm fine, , then this same friend A in low voice said STOP BEING SO STINGY ,i heard that because I was sitting JUST NEXT TO HER ,then I took out whatever money I had but ig my other friend ""B"" somewhere understood i didn't have money to eat so she ordered food for me then i didn't have any energy left in me,then I told myself that I'm overthinking and When we were heading to our home my friend A ( Yeah same one) told us ( me and B ) that she wanted to buy some sauces and coffe then we together went to the shop then she told me that I want to buy X sauce and X coffee ,go and ask. ( Now I wanna say thatA & B  both are introvert and I'm ambivert with high introvert side) I was so drained that I told her that I have no energy left in me so I can't do it ,she ignored me then i had to talk to shopkeeper and buy all the stuff then we parted ways

1poa6ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1poa6ha/hr_dollimination/,[HR] Dollimination,"There are voodoo secrets unknown to society at large, never reaching documentaries or speculative fiction. For example, most laymen rest assured, assuming that since they’ve never met a witch doctor, such a personage couldn’t possibly possess an item personal enough to that layman—hair, toenail, Band-Aid, or whatever—to permit any hexes against them. But in fact, the very best voodoo dolls are produced from self-portraits, a person’s self-image filtered through whatever illustrative skill they possess. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley Clarke, he learned of that voodoo secret from a haggish Starbucks patron, who took offense when he opted not to sign her outthrust comic book—*The Unspooling* issue eight—which he’d written and illustrated some years prior. In Bradley’s defense, the woman had clumsily bumped his table and toppled his cappuccino, and he was frantically napkin-dabbing his slacks when the comic materialized from the depths of her Burberry backpack. 

 

“I’m a fan of your work,” the woman assured him. Still, he waved her away. He’d been getting recognized often lately; it was annoying. 

 

“Get lost, you old bitch,” he grunted, taking no small measure of joy as he watched her face crumple into a downcast expression, one incongruous with the psychedelic shawl that she wore.

 

Through her tears and livid shaking, the old gal muttered, “No, no, you shouldn’t have. You shouldn’t…you shouldn’t have done it.”

 

“Your parents shouldn’t have spawned you, so go find a bridge to live under,” Bradley countered. “That’s right, I just called you a troll. What can *you* do about it? As a matter of fact, were it up to me, people like you wouldn’t be allowed to read my comics in the first place.”      

 

“People like me? *People like me?* You dare insult hoodooists?”

 

“Hoodooists? Is that what inbred hags call themselves nowadays?” 

 

“Inbred? *Inbred!* What the heck is your problem? I approached you politely, humbly requesting an autograph, and you went and treated me like week-old, diseased spittle. Someone…*somebody* needs to teach you a lesson!” 

 

“Lesson, huh? Talk about lessons after you graduate from kindergarten, ya empty-headed spastic. They should stick you on an island—or better yet, under one.” *Wow, I’m really laying into her, aren’t I?* Bradley thought, delighted. *What’s gotten into me today? Surely, spilled coffee alone can’t shape me into someone this sinister? Have I forgotten something I should be pissed-off about?*     

 

Seemingly shrinking two inches, the elderly lady flung her entire physicality into a quivering tirade, a finger-waving string of invectives. Mangling much conjugation, interspersing four-letter nastiness every five words or so, she explained that thing about voodoo (you know, from this story’s first paragraph).

 

“I have your self portrait!” she added. “You’re sure in for it, buddy!” To better illustrate her assertion, she opened Bradley’s comic and pointed out its protagonist in a succession of images. Bradley hadn’t just been *The Unspooling*’s creator, you see, he’d also been its star, having written the tale about his experiences as he wrote the tale. It was one of those meta sort of pieces, that certain types of people relate to. 

 

Unfortunately for Bradley, those kinds of fans didn’t mesh well with him in public. Frankly, most looked as if they were about to sneeze on him—and sometimes did, for that matter. Often, they’d demand to take a photo with Bradley, even though he hated to be photographed, due to that wart on his cheek that resembled a nipple. Never were they voluptuous groupies, or even related to any.        

 

“Come on, lady,” groaned Bradley. “We both know that voodoo’s not real. You’re only degrading that issue’s value…when it was Very Fine to begin with, tops.”  

 

“I’m gonna curse you, boy! Curse you bad! A real bad curse! Then I’m gonna tell my online hoodooist group all about it! Best believe!”

 

“Online hoodooist group? *Online hoodooist group!* Lady, I thought those Sarah McLachlan animal cruelty videos were the saddest thing I ever saw. Then you came into my life. I tell ya, my soul weeps.” 

 

“Soul?” she yelped. “Soul, sir…your soul is, is…is curdled. In fact, say goodbye to your soul. It’s…muh-muh-mine.” 

 

*Yeah, she looks like she’s gonna sneeze, alright*, Bradley thought.

 

“Mine!” the woman shrieked, before thundering right out of the Starbucks. 

 

“Hers,” Bradley laughed, making his way to the counter to attain a coffee to go. He decided to throw away his slacks the very instant he got home, to better help him forget the encounter.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Naturally, forgetting the encounter wasn’t the coffee spiller’s intention. Matilda Grieves was her name. Fuming was her mentality, inundated by recollections of past insults, the sort that had shaped her into a hoodooist to begin with. 

 

Powering on her MacBook, she announced, “I’ll show him, yes, yes. I’ll make every second of every minute of his every day agonized. *The Unspooling* fooled me good. I actually thought Bradley-\*asshole-\*Clarke to be a kindred spirit. Never again, I say. Never, never. That snobby jerk thinks he’s so great. Well, I’ll show him, yes I will.” 

 

With her laptop’s built-in webcam, Matilda recorded a simple how-to video, which she immediately uploaded to her hoodooist group’s website. In the video, she used scissors to cut out a front profile illustration of Bradley Clarke, from *The Unspooling*’s seventh issue, and then a back profile illustration, from *The Unspooling* issue four, of roughly equivalent dimensions. She then traced both onto canvas, cut it carefully, and sewed everything together, stuffed with yarn. Just as simple as that, Bradley had been reproduced in effigy. 

 

In closing, Matilda snarled at the webcam and exhorted, “This comic book bastard mocked us, my sisters. He thinks we’re pathetic, a buncha inbred hags playin’ make-believe. So let’s teach him a lesson—all of us, together, today. Make voodoo dolls of your own, and we’ll hit Mr. Clarke with enough hexes to leave his doomed, bastard head spinnin’.”

 

As dozens of her web chums placed same-day delivery orders, or busily bustled their way to comic book dealers, Matilda took her Bradley doll for a spin. 

 

First, she made the thing do the splits. 

 

And lo and behold, in another part of the city, Bradley found himself plummeting painfully upon his testicles, legs pointed eastward and westward. Shrieking, he rolled onto his side, only to find his left foot flying into his face, over and over. “What’s happening?” he wailed. 

 

“It worked, I can feel it,” Matilda declared, alone in her bedroom. Frankly, the power she felt coursing through her body aroused her sexually. Fantasizing about rubbing the doll against her erogenous zones, she became flush-faced, and had to remind herself that she absolutely hated Bradley Clarke. 

 

Palpitating, she decided to take an especially lengthy cold shower. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

There are voodoo secrets unknown even to most hoodooists. Prime amongst them is the effect that multiple voodoo dolls have on their subject. I mean, how many people are deemed so reprehensible that they garner drastic measures from not just one, but multiple hexers? That percentage is so infinitesimal, it was previously unheard of. 

 

While Matilda showered, the first of her confrères completed her own Bradley doll. The very moment that she finished sewing the thing together, an astounding process commenced. Seated in his kitchen with an icepack on his scrotum, Bradley felt himself being tugged by an invisible force. “Ahhhh!” he hollered, gritting what felt like too many teeth, assailed by a splitting headache. 

 

*I’m exchanging stature for breadth*, he thought, shrinking and widening. Arms sprouted from his neck. His genitals doubled, as did his legs. His vision temporarily dilated, as he fell off of his chair while remaining seated. 

 

Due to an inexplicable binary fission, there were now two Bradley Clarkes, each half the size and weight of the original. Even his clothing—jeans and an Indian Jewelry shirt, the one with the drippy lips—had doubled and shrunk, though the ice pack remained singular. 

 

“What the hell is this?” both Bradleys asked, synchronized. Then, suddenly, the floored Bradley was slapping his own face with alternating palms, whilst the other Bradley watched, quite perplexed. And even as that occurred, flesh began to stream from both his self-slapping and seated selves. Amalgamating, it formed a third Bradley—the same size as those two, who had shrunken. 

 

Reclining, the new Bradley slid up the wall, then back down to the floor, then right back up the wall, even as his flesh streamed to help form a fourth Bradley. 

 

And that’s how it continued. Bradleys contributed mass to new Bradleys. Ceaselessly shrinking, they endured every painful calamity those distant hoodooists saw fit to send over. One’s leg twisted so severely that bone shards poked out in three places; another found himself blinded as both his eyes imploded. A few danced without rhythm, or leapt far higher than they ought to have. Soon, the kitchen was filled with Bradleys, which was when the deaths began. 

 

One Bradley went up in flames; another endured a waterless drowning. Four strangulated themselves purple-faced. A Bradley spun his head off his shoulders while dancing a jig. Another was crumpled into a ball hardly recognizable as human. Replicated shrieks filled the residence, which might have reached the ears of 911-dialing neighbors, were any home from work at the time.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Matilda’s hoodooist network was far larger than one might suspect, and the ratio of live Bradleys to dead ones kept increasing. In fact, the process soon prompted the most clandestine of voodoo secrets to manifest. 

 

You see, when a voodoo doll’s subject is shrunken smaller than their effigy, they effectively become their voodoo doll’s doll. Unseen, true musculature blossoms within canvas. Eyes of glossy, illustrated paper become fully functional. Faux fingers flex as functioning digits. 

 

Ergo, even as the hoodooists contorted and mangled their respective dolls, cackling, they were unaware that such actions no longer affected any Bradley. Indeed, abandoning their physicality, each Bradley now bided his time as a spirit existing inside his own effigy. 

 

Each would wait until their hexer was vulnerable—sleeping, reading, or otherwise distracted—and then they’d enact their revenge. They’d gather knifes, razors, knitting needles, and other sharp implements, and assail hoodooist flesh with all proper animus. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The original Bradley doll trudged toward a bathroom, wherein a showered Matilda was toweling herself dry. Awkwardly, he clutched a pair of scissors, which he’d discovered beneath her living room sofa. 

 

*I’ll give that old bitch her autograph after all*, he thought, grinning paper lips. *I’ll carve it in permanent, and see how she likes it.* ",1,1765911129.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

But what if it could be simple, natural, organic, and deeply effective? That’s the promise behind **Roots San Francisco** – a skincare and supplement brand built on the belief that true beauty is a combination of internal and external health management. Their motto, **InsideOut Radiance**, reflects this philosophy my blending powerful mushroom based topical treatments with internal supplements to create a balanced foundation for natural youthful glow.

  
**Roots San Francisco** was founded by **Morgana Quieroz and Egan Christensen**, two individuals with distinctly different backgrounds but a shared vision: to create products that nourish the whole self.

  
**Morgana**, a certified medical aesthetician with over 15 years of experience, brings deep expertise in skincare and holistic health. Her spa,[ **Skin by Morgana**](https://www.skinbymorgana.com/), was named one of the **Top 5 Spas in San Francisco by SF Gate in 2024** and is in the running again in 2025. Known for her transformative touch and commitment to excellence, Morgana now only uses Roots San Francisco products in her Spa treatments – and her extremely loyal clientele are absolutely glowing over the results! In addition, she loves helping, training and aspiring upand-coming aestheticians, sharing her knowledge and passion with the next generation of skincare professionals.

**Egan**, a seasoned business and technology executive, brings a passion for helping companies thrive. With global leadership roles at Hitachi Data Systems, Dell, VMware, as well as multiple start-ups, he offers a holistic, results-driven approach to growth and innovation for individuals with a vision or companies wanting to get to the next level. At [Egan Solutions](http://www.egan-solutions.com/), he helps develop and refine tailored business plans, forecasts, and strategies – optimizing products and service offerings, marketing, sales, customer success and support, operations, legal, HR, and finance, along with AI-driven solutions enabling success, efficiency, and profitability while keeping work-life balance front and center.

Morgana’s vision for Roots SF was grounded in her belief that skincare should be both luxurious and deeply restorative – working in harmony with the body’s natural rhythms. Her extensive training, clinical insights, and hands-on experience shaped the brand’s commitment to clean, organic, natural ingredients and transformative results. Egan’s strategic leadership helped bring that vision to life, guiding the brand from concept to launch with careful attention to building the right foundation for quality, sustainability, and performance. The selection of mushrooms became fundamental to this vision, as they have been used for thousands of years in traditional medicine to promote healing and health improvements. By incorporating these beneficial mushrooms into their products, Roots SF has harnessed their transformative power to create a skincare line that truly embodies Inside-Out Radiance.

Morgana uses Roots SF products herself daily and has seen dramatic improvements in her own skin tone, texture, hydration, and overall health. Her clients share stories of how their skin feels brighter, smoother, and more balanced **after the first treatment.** Many **purchase products after each session and continue ordering online.** Having struggled with rosacea for years, especially around his nose and under his eyes, Egan found complete relief using Roots SF’s newly divined products. That transformation, along with Morgana’s personal experience and happy customers, confirmed what the founders had set out to prove: that natural, organic skincare – especially when powered by mushroom extracts like Reishi, Chaga, Shiitake, and more – can deliver real, visible, and measurable results – proof that the results speak for themselves.

**Roots SF** offers a curated line of skincare and wellness products designed to support **Inside-Out Radiance**. Their skincare collection includes moisturizers, toners, and serums such as **Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C, and the Scar & Pore Serum**, formulated to hydrate, brighten, and refine skin texture. The Supplement line features gummies, elixirs, and probiotics, along with mushroom-based ingredients like **Reishi, Ashwagandha, Lion’s Mane, and Cordyceps** to support skin health as well as immunity, stress balance, and cognitive clarity. **Roots SF** also offers gentle cleansers and handcrafted soaps made with organic oils and adaptogenic botanicals to nourish and purify the skin.

Additional offerings include targeted **Hair and Scalp Treatments**, available as both a serum and a supplement, designed to strengthen follicles, reduce inflammation, and promote healthy growth. For those focused on metabolic health, **Roots SF** provides weight loss support through mushroom and plant-based supplements and a complementary serum that helps regulate appetite and energy. Rounding out the wellness experience is the **Lion’s Mane & Chaga Arabic Coffee**, a dual-function blend that delivers antioxidant-rich energy and mental clarity in one delicious daily ritual.

  
While the full collection reflects a commitment to clean, effective, and sustainable wellness, two standout products best illustrate the brand’s **Inside-Out Radiance philosophy.**



[**Derma Bright Serum with Kojic Acid** ](https://www.rootssanfrancisco.com/products/dark-spot-serum-with-kojic-acid)is a powerful brightening formula that blends mushroom-sourced ingredients and botanical nutrients to support skin tone and texture.

My aunt told me to flee when I get the chance but I feel so guilty. I keep internalizing my mom's lies that I owe her but I also keep thinking about how she saw me here for years with no clothes, unkempt hair, not leaving the house for years and never once attempted to help me. She gave Auntie Karen $8k that would have changed the trajectory of my life. 

She helped cousin Daniel more than she's helped me. She hasn't once said one kind thing to me or uttered an ""i love you"" ever but makes it a regular occurrence to call me anything but a child of God. She shuts me down whenever I try to open u, she threatens me and physically intimidates me. She accuses me of not doing anything when I do more than anyone else in this house while she also makes new demands of me each week. 

She looks at me with hatred in her eyes, accuses me of the worst things and didn't even ask if I had food on thanksgiving while she left to my sisters house to celebrate. She knows I'm not working and even though I lied about finally getting unemployment to get her off my back, she charges me $550 for rent even though I don't cook, rarely use space in the fridge, there is no space for me in any of the three freezers or cabinets, I am forced to share a bathroom with someone with squalor syndrome so I can't even access the bathroom most days and haven't properly showered in nearly a month but my mom gets angry if I use 'her' toilet which is the one next to my bedroom. 

I barely eat or I simply order my own food because she makes it clear she sees me as only a roommate and she is not here to take care of grown ass adults. She claims the living room is her space (she also has her own bedroom and dibs on the sunroom) and my bedroom is my space in the house. She constantly accuses me of stealing (not just money but her coffee pot, divorce papers?, car tags, the switch for a random light bulb, anything really). Last week, she raised the rent to $750 so it's split equally between me, her and my sister who has the entire downstairs to herself. I owe for two months rent (including this month) but I have been in contact with shelters. She told me that I am not allowed to leave without paying her and she threatens to beat my ass because that's what happens to adults who owe money. Over $1100.

 But when I gave my 30 day notice, she accused me of being selfish and being more willing to pay a stranger than my own mother who let me live with her rent free for years. I do feel guilty because I had lived with her rent for two years before I started paying rent but I only was living with her because I had been homeless for years and lost all my belongings in a storage fire. Plus, I only became homeless because I had to flee because she was trying to beat me up and threatening to kill me and I was scared for my life.

Am I really selfish? I am trying to scrape up the money to pay her before I leave so that she doesn't think I was taking advantage of her but my aunt says she is my mother and I need to leave immediately.",2,1765910924.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,0.76,False

He mentioned casually, “There’s already someone staying there. A girl.”

I said okay. I didn’t ask anything else.

The first time I saw her, she was sitting cross-legged on the floor, folding clothes with wired earphones in. She looked up, nodded, and went back to what she was doing. No small talk. No curiosity.

That became our normal.

We shared the flat, not our lives. I left late for work. She woke up early for coaching. Sometimes we crossed paths in the kitchen, doing that silent dance of who-stands-where. Sometimes we didn’t see each other all day.

Weeks went by without a real conversation.

Not because of tension.
Because silence was easier.

I’d hear her reading softly from the next room late at night. Some competitive exam. She’d hear my alarm ring three times every morning. Once, I forgot my charger on the dining table. It appeared on my desk by evening.

Another day, I came home drenched in monsoon rain. There was a towel hanging on my chair. Warm. Dry.

We never talked about these things.

Friends assumed something was going on. I always said no. And it was true. But it wasn’t the whole truth either.

One evening, during a power cut, the flat went completely quiet. No fan. No lights. Just the sound of traffic from the highway.

She came out with a candle and placed it on the table between us. Then she sat down across from me.

We didn’t speak.

After a long pause, she said, “You drink too much tea.”

I laughed, louder than necessary.

“You read everything out loud,” I said back.

She smiled. Just for a second.

After that, things shifted. Not dramatically. Gently.

She’d ask if I’d eaten. I’d ask how coaching was going. Short sentences. Long pauses. Some evenings we sat in the same room doing completely different things, comfortable in the shared quiet.

Once I fell sick. High fever. I woke up at 3 a.m. to hear her in the kitchen. A bowl of soup appeared outside my door. No knock.

Another time, I heard her crying quietly. I didn’t interfere. The next morning, I made breakfast for both of us. She ate without looking at me, but she stayed.

Months passed like this.

No labels. No planning. Just presence.

One day she mentioned she might move out. Better job offer in Hinjewadi. Closer to work.

I said, “Okay.”

The word felt wrong the moment it left my mouth.

That night neither of us slept.

In the morning she said, “I don’t want to leave if you don’t.”

I said, “I don’t want you to leave.”

That was it. No speeches. No promises.

Life moved on. Careers grew heavier. Responsibilities piled up. Eventually, our paths didn’t stay aligned forever. Not every connection is meant to.

But I still think about that flat sometimes. The candle on the table. The monsoon rain. The silence that slowly turned into something else.

Nothing special. A sagging cot, a metal shelf with a first-aid kit, a rattling space heater. But it was quiet. No black SUVs outside. No Division trackers pinging. No Carter.

For now.

I didn’t sleep much. When I did, the nightmares came.

Not about the things I’d hunted. Claws and teeth are simple. You can point a gun at those.

The worst nightmares were about me.

My skin shifting when I let my guard down.

My bones feeling like they weren’t set right.

The Revenant’s voice echoing in the back of my skull.

That thing inside you? It’s waking up.

I woke up sweating, heart racing, body aching in a way that felt wrong—like pressure, not fatigue. Like something inside me was testing how far it could go.

I stared at my hands in the dim light.

Flexed my fingers.

The skin felt too tight over the tendons. Not ripping. Just… off. Like it didn’t belong completely to me anymore.

You were never meant to be the hero, 18C. You were meant to be a weapon.

I closed my fists and forced my breathing to slow.

If I was going to war with The Division, I needed more than anger.

I needed a plan.

Two days passed. The diner stayed mostly empty—truckers, locals, nobody who looked twice at me if I tipped and kept my hood up. The constant was Lily, leaning on the counter between orders, watching me with that quiet, measuring stare.

“You’re not just some guy on the run, are you?” she said eventually.

I paused halfway through a bite of cold eggs. “Why do you say that?”

She nodded toward my side. Last time she’d seen it, the wound had been bad enough that I’d barely stayed upright.

Now it was gone.

“Those ribs were wrecked,” she said. “You should be hunched over, not sitting like nothing happened.”

I sighed. Put the fork down. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.”

She gave a small, tired smile. “Try me.”

There was something in her eyes—more than curiosity. She’d seen things too.

“The government turned me into something that shouldn’t exist,” I said. “Now they want me dead.”

She didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

“What kind of something?” she asked.

That was the problem.

“I’m still figuring that out,” I said.

She held my gaze a second longer, then reached under the counter and pulled out a worn leather notebook. She slid it over.

“I’ve been keeping track of things,” she said. “Stuff that doesn’t add up. Disappearances. ‘Gas leaks’ nobody reports. News stories that vanish after a day.”

I opened it.

Pages full of clippings, printed forum posts, blurry photos, coordinates, arrows, circled dates. Some of the locations made my stomach turn.

Halfway through, one entry stopped me cold.

Division Outpost 3 — Montana. Abandoned in 2019 after failed containment of subject. No official closure report. All digital records scrubbed.

I knew that place.

It was where I’d killed the Skinned Man.

My first mission.

In Division records, Outpost 3 had been shut down. Clean. Logged.

According to Lily’s notebook, it didn’t shut down.

It went dark.

“Where did you get this?” I asked.

“Public records. Some stuff from dead links. People who talk too much online.” She tapped the line. “Whatever happened there? The area’s a black hole. People go near it, they don’t come back.”

If The Division had really walked away from an outpost and wiped the paper trail, it meant one thing.

They were afraid of it.

“This,” I said, tapping the page, “might be where I start.”

“You sure?” she asked.

No.

But I nodded. “Sure enough.”

Montana was colder than I remembered.

The wind knifed through the trees, carrying the smell of frozen pine and old bark, with something sour underneath it.

Rot.

I tightened my grip on the steering wheel of the stolen truck. The engine rattled as I followed an old service road that barely existed anymore, headlights swallowed by low, creeping fog.

No streetlights. No houses. Just the road, the woods, and that familiar static behind my eyes.

The closer I got, the worse it got. Pressure built in my chest, like my lungs were being squeezed from the inside.

I knew that feeling.

I wasn’t alone.

I pulled into the clearing at 2:13 AM and killed the engine. Silence hit hard.

For a second, I just watched my breath fog the windshield.

Then I stepped out.

The outpost sat ahead of me.

Up close, it looked like a carcass. Concrete walls cracked and caved, rusted beams jutting up like broken ribs. What was left of The Division insignia clung to the entrance, peeled and faded.

The smell hit next.

Old blood. Mold. Chemicals.

And something else. Meat that had been left too long in a warm room.

I checked my gear—handgun, knife, flashlight, extra mags. A rifle wouldn’t help in a place like this.

Up close beats distance.

The main doors weren’t broken; they were peeled outward. Metal twisted like foil.

Something inside had wanted out badly.

I stepped over the threshold.

My flashlight cut through the dark. Dust floated in the beam. Footprints—turned to dark, flaking smears—trailed away from the entrance.

The air shifted around me, the smell changing with it. The walls almost felt like they were holding a breath.

No voices. No beeping machines. Just the quiet heaviness of a place that had seen violence and then been abandoned to rot.

I moved deeper.

Broken glass. Plastic shards. An ID badge face-down on the floor, the photo side ground away.

The feeling in my chest got tighter the deeper I went. Not fear—recognition.

This wasn’t just an abandoned base.

It was a grave.

An overturned desk blocked part of the corridor where the security station had been. I nudged it aside with my boot. Papers, a mug, a half-melted pistol.

Whatever had happened here, nobody left in formation. They ran.

From farther inside came a soft, wet drag. A sound you feel in your teeth more than in your ears.

I swung the flashlight down the hall.

Nothing.

The corridor forked.

Left went toward holding cells. I knew that much from old schematics I wasn’t supposed to have seen.

Right went toward the labs.

The drag had come from the left.

Every instinct told me to follow it.

I went right.

Whatever was in the cells wasn’t why this outpost went dark. The labs were.

The air grew thicker, humid and close. The smell of mold and copper mixing with a chemical sting that clung to the back of my throat. Water dripped from somewhere overhead, splashing into shallow puddles.

The hallway ended at a reinforced door.

Unlike the others, this one hadn’t been torn apart.

It was sealed.

A cracked terminal pulsed weak light beside it.

I pressed my palm to the biometric pad.

For a second, nothing.

Then:

ACCESS GRANTED.

Locks hissed. The door groaned open.

The lab was big.

Rows of tall glass containment tanks lined the walls, most of them shattered. Tubes hung loose. The overhead lights flickered in weak pulses.

The smell was worse here.

Rot. Chemicals.

And bodies.

At least a dozen Division agents slumped against the far wall, fused to it where their uniforms had melted into their flesh. Their faces were warped, frozen in mid-scream. Skin stretched too tight around their torsos, like something had swelled inside before they died.

I crouched next to the nearest one.

The veins in his arms were empty.

Not bled out.

Hollow.

Something had eaten them out from the inside.

I straightened and moved carefully through the lab.

At the far end, a secondary door hung halfway open.

Observation.

I stepped inside.

Monitors lined one wall. Most were dead. One still flickered, looping corrupted security footage.

I moved closer.

The timestamp read four years ago.

The view showed the lab I’d just walked through. Empty.

Then a figure stumbled into frame.

Lab coat. ID badge. His face was twisted with pain. Black veins stood out along his neck. He dropped to his knees, clawing at his chest.

His stomach bulged.

Something moved under his skin. Pushing. Squirming.

His ribs bowed and cracked.

He didn’t explode.

He opened.

His skin stretched and split in strips, peeling back. Bone bent aside. Something pulled itself free of him.

It unfolded on long, shaking limbs, too tall and thin. Its skin was translucent, dark veins moving under the surface.

Where a face should have been was a hollow cavity ringed with writhing tendrils.

The scientist’s empty body collapsed behind it.

The footage glitched.

Then jumped.

Now the lab was chaos. Figures running. Muzzles flashing. Things half-caught by the camera—tall, bending wrong, flesh flickering like it couldn’t decide on a shape.

More of them.

Dozens.

The video cut.

The monitor went black.

I listened to the fading hum of old power and my own pulse in my ears.

The Division hadn’t wrapped this place because they were done.

They lost.

A slow, wet dripping sound rolled in from the lab.

Thicker than water.

I turned.

Something clung to the ceiling near the broken tanks.

Limbs spread wide, fingers and joints hooked into the concrete, its shape folded into the shadows. Translucent flesh shivered slightly in my beam, veins shifting underneath.

It had been here the whole time.

Watching.

Waiting.

My gun was already in my hand.

It didn’t attack.

It uncoiled.

It lowered itself with awful control, limbs stretching, bones rearranging under the skin with soft cracking sounds.

Then it hit me.

Not physically.

In my head.

My own memories flashed—waking up in a metal room, gas in my lungs, my bones screaming as they changed, cold chemicals burning in my veins.

The thing’s hollow face tilted wider.

More memories came that weren’t mine. People splitting open. Tunnels made of meat. A sense of hunger that had never been fed enough.

My skull felt like it was going to split.

It knew me.

It recognized whatever The Division had put inside me.

I stumbled back a step, forcing my grip to stay tight on the knife I’d already drawn without realizing.

The whispers dug deeper, scraping at who I was, trying to pull pieces loose.

It thought I was like it.

Waiting to remember.

Heat flared through my veins.

For a second, something inside me wanted to answer.

I shoved it down.

The moment my stance shifted, it moved.

It dropped like a net made of limbs and bone, arms snapping toward my throat and head.

The world snapped into slow motion.

Everything sharpened. Every limb, every angle, every tendon stood out. I slipped under the first strike, turned away from the second, felt air brush my face where a bone spike should have been.

My knife flashed and bit into its side.

The scream that came out of it wasn’t a sound—it was pressure. A wall of voices, hundreds layered together, crashed into my skull.

My legs buckled. I hit the floor, ears ringing. It felt like my thoughts were getting shoved to the edges.

It pushed into my head.

I pushed back.

Not with anything special.

Just with that stubborn, ugly instinct that refused to let anything else take control again.

The pressure cracked.

The creature spasmed, limbs jerking out of rhythm.

I lunged.

I drove the knife into its torso and left it there as the flesh clenched around the blade. I grabbed one of its arms and ripped.

The limb tore free with a wet pop.

Black, thick veins pulsed and twisted at the stump, trying to regrow.

I grabbed a broken piece of pipe from the floor and drove it through its chest, hard enough to pin it to the wall.

Its scream shifted.

The confidence went out of it.

The body began to lose cohesion, shaking around the pipe. Limbs slackened. Edges blurred, like its shape was sliding off whatever held it together.

The whispers in my head shredded into nothing.

It shuddered once more and collapsed inward, shrinking until there was nothing there but a dark smear that faded into the air.

No body.

No blood.

Just absence.

I stood there, breathing hard, hands slick with whatever passed for its blood.

I looked down at myself.

Still me.

Skin wasn’t crawling. Bones weren’t shifting. My head was my own.

Whatever was inside me had moved—but it hadn’t taken over.

Not yet.

The Division thought this place was a graveyard.

It was a mirror.

Proof they didn’t understand what they’d made.

Proof I wasn’t just one of their experiments anymore.

I gave the lab one last look and left.

By the time I reached the truck again, the sky was just starting to lighten at the edges. I drove without stopping, letting the miles blur past.

Find Carter.

Make him talk.

Find out what I was before something else did.

I should’ve known The Division wouldn’t wait.

I was passing the ruins of a dead mining town when it happened. Boarded-up buildings, rusted equipment, the skeleton of a place everyone had already forgotten.

The world erupted.

A blast ripped through the truck’s front end. The steering wheel tore sideways. The airbag punched the breath out of me. We skidded off the road, metal screaming, into a ditch.

Then silence.

The cabin stank of burnt rubber and propellant.

Floodlights snapped on outside, all at once, blinding.

I reached for my gun.

A shock round hit center mass.

Electricity surged through me. Every muscle locked; my jaw clenched so hard my teeth screamed. I hit the ground outside the truck and couldn’t move.

Boots crunched on gravel.

“You should’ve stayed hidden, 18C,” Carter’s voice said somewhere above me.

Then everything went black.

I woke up strapped to a chair.

Cold metal. Tight restraints. No slack.

Bare room. Metal walls. Single light. No windows.

Carter stood in front of me, hands clasped.

He looked calm. Tired. Like this was paperwork.

I tested the restraints. Reinforced. Bolted down.

“Go to hell,” I said.

He smiled a little. “Eventually.”

He opened a folder on the table and turned it so I could see.

My own face stared back at me from a medical photo. Tubes everywhere.

Scans. Bone structure denser than normal. Brain activity flagged as “non-standard.” Metabolic charts that didn’t look human anymore.

“Project Revenant was never just about soldiers,” Carter said. “You weren’t the first attempt. You’re just the only one still pretending you’re a person.”

I said nothing.

He flicked his wrist.

A screen behind me came to life.

I twisted enough to see.

The diner.

Lily behind the counter, wiping it down.

My pulse spiked.

Carter tapped his wrist again.

The feed changed.

Her apartment. A sniper on a neighboring rooftop, rifle trained. A red dot hovered near where her chest would be if she walked into frame.

“You come back,” Carter said. “You work with us. Or she dies.”

I pulled against the restraints. Nothing gave.

They wanted me alive. If I was just a liability, they’d have finished it at the outpost.

Lily was bait.

I swallowed the anger and forced my voice flat.

“Fine.”

Carter’s eyebrows lifted. “Fine?”

“I’ll work with you,” I said.

He studied my face, then nodded, satisfied.

“Good. Let’s—”

I moved.

I threw my weight forward, snapping two of the chair legs. Momentum carried us both over. We hit the floor. He grabbed for his gun.

I hooked my ankles around his throat and yanked.

We crashed. The restraints bit into my wrists as I twisted, forcing my bones to slide just enough the wrong way for the cuffs to slip.

It hurt.

Didn’t matter.

My hands came free.

I tore his sidearm from its holster and pressed it to his head.

“Call off the sniper,” I said. “Now.”

“You’re—” he started.

I shoved the barrel harder into his skull. “Call. Him. Off.”

Carter exhaled, then hit his wrist comm. “Hold position.”

On the screen, the red dot vanished.

It didn’t make me feel better.

I shot him in the knee anyway.

The sound was loud in the metal room. He yelled, clutching his leg as blood spread across the floor.

I took his wrist unit and pulled up layout, cameras, exits.

We were underground.

Main elevator was a kill funnel.

Hangar bay.

Vent network.

The door flew open.

A guard stepped in, rifle raised.

I put a round in his throat before he finished aiming.

Another came in with a baton crackling. I stepped inside his swing, broke his wrist, slammed his head into the wall.

Alarms wailed. Gas hissed from vents overhead.

I grabbed a dropped mask, strapped it on, and ran.

The corridor was chaos—flashing red lights, sirens, echoing footsteps. I followed the map burned into my head. Left. Right. Up a flight. Vent access.

I kicked a grate open and pulled myself into the shaft. The gas made my arms feel like they were full of sand. Voices echoed through the metal below, too close.

I crawled.

Light seeped through the final grate.

I looked down.

Hangar.

A sleek black aircraft sat ready. Pilot in the cockpit. Two guards nearby with rifles slung.

I dropped down.

First guard’s throat collapsed under my elbow. Second grabbed for his gun; I put two rounds in his chest.

The pilot fumbled with the controls. I dragged him out and bounced his head off the console. He stayed down.

Rifles barked from the far end of the hangar. Bullets sparked off the hull.

I hit everything that looked like it should be hit.

The engines roared to life.

The plane lurched, then screamed forward. The bay doors opened just enough for us to blast through.

Then I was in the air.

Barely.

By the time the facility was a dark patch in the snow behind me, my hands were shaking.

Carter wasn’t dead.

But I was out.

For now.

I poured the last of the fuel into getting back to the diner. By the time I put the aircraft down in a clearing a mile away, the sky was starting to bruise with sunrise.

The woods around the roadside diner were too quiet.

I walked in through the front door.

Empty lobby. Chairs knocked over. Coffee burnt to sludge on the warmer. The air smelled like dust and something sour.

A sharp click sounded behind me.

I turned.

Lily stood in the kitchen doorway, shotgun raised.

She stared a second, then lowered it. “You look like shit.”

“Feels accurate,” I said.

Up close, she didn’t look much better.

She nodded at the mess. “They came looking for you. Said you were dangerous. I told them I’d never seen you before.” She shrugged. “Didn’t believe me. But they left.”

“They didn’t hurt you?” I asked.

“Not yet,” she said.

I moved to the window and scanned the tree line. The air felt heavy again, that same pressure digging into the back of my skull.

“What now?” she asked.

“We run,” I said.

“To where?”

I didn’t know.

Before I could answer, the lights flickered.

Outside, something moved.

At first, it was just distortion in the air. Then it stepped closer.

Tall. Thin. Limbs too long, joints bending wrong. Its skin looked like dead wood stretched over bone.

And it was covered in faces.

Human faces. Layered, stitched together, shifting as it moved. Some young, some old, some warped beyond recognition.

They slid over each other until one settled on top.

Mine.

Lily’s breath hitched. “Tell me that’s not—”

It smiled with my face.

“You are not the first,” it said, using my voice.

Glass shattered as the front windows blew inward. We ducked behind the counter. Shards rained over the floor.

The thing’s presence pressed into my head like cold fingers, probing.

You were built to be like us. Let go.

My skin crawled. I could feel something inside me twitch, like it wanted to answer.

“Got a plan?” Lily hissed, jamming shells into the shotgun.

“Yeah,” I said. “You’re gonna hate it.”

I scanned the ruined diner. No basement. One back door. Broken front. No way we both got out clean.

“We trap it,” I said.

“With what?” she snapped.

“Me.”

She stared. “Absolutely not.”

“If it gets both of us, that’s it,” I said. “If it gets me and you’re still breathing? You can make sure this doesn’t happen for nothing.”

The thing creaked across the broken glass, getting closer. The lights flickered again.

I shoved Carter’s communicator into her hand.

“Find him,” I said. “If he wants me that bad, use this to drag him into the open.”

She stared at it. “You’re insane.”

“Probably,” I said. “Still the best shot we’ve got.”

She looked like she wanted to argue.

Then she nodded once.

“Don’t die,” she said.

“I’ll try,” I said.

She slipped out the back.

I stood.

The thing waited in the center of the diner, limbs unfolding slowly. My face rippled across its features, eyes empty.

I stopped holding back.

The thing inside me, the speed and instinct I kept on a leash—I let it loose.

The world sharpened.

It lunged.

It came at me in a blur of limbs and teeth and open mouths. Faces tore and reformed as it moved.

I met it halfway.

We hit hard. Tables flipped. The counter cracked. The floor groaned.

I saw every opening. Every weak spot.

My fist punched into its chest, through fake ribs and pulsing tissue. I grabbed something solid and tore it free.

It screamed inside my skull, a blast of stolen voices trying to flood my head. It drove a tendril into my arm, trying to hook into my veins.

I yanked it out and didn’t stop.

I slammed my knee into its center, used the momentum to hurl it across the room. It smashed into the counter and tried to reassemble itself.

I was already on it.

I grabbed what passed for its throat—my own face buckling under my fingers—and squeezed until something cracked.

It clawed at me, raked across my side, but the pain was distant.

I dragged it across the floor and pinned it against the wall.

A broken length of rebar lay nearby.

I snatched it up and drove it straight through its skull.

The scream cut off.

The body convulsed, faces flickering in and out of existence.

Then it began to cave in on itself. Flesh blurred to shadow, shadow to nothing.

In seconds, it was gone.

Just me, the wrecked diner, and the ringing in my ears.

The thing in my blood burned hot, then cooled.

I was still me.

For now.

Headlights washed across the broken front of the diner.

Three black SUVs rolled into the lot.

The Division.

Doors opened. Men with rifles spread out, forming a perimeter.

Carter stepped out last.

He took one look at the destruction, at me standing in the middle of it all, and lowered his gun.

“Stand down,” he said.

The rifles lowered.

He walked closer, boots crunching glass.

“You won,” he said.

I didn’t reply.

His gaze flicked past me to where the creature had been, then back.

“We didn’t send that,” he said. “It was already tracking you when we picked it up on satellite.”

A cold weight settled in my stomach.

“What aren’t you telling me?” I asked.

He hesitated.

“You felt it,” he said quietly. “During the fight.”

I clenched my jaw.

Because I had.

That moment everything slowed. When I knew what it would do before it moved. When something inside me recognized it.

“We knew something was coming,” Carter said. “We just didn’t know when.”

He nodded at the woods.

“When we saw that thing moving straight for you? That’s when we realized it’s already started.”

“What has?” I asked.

For the first time, I saw it.

Fear in his eyes.

“Everything we’ve been hunting,” he said. “All the cryptids. All the anomalies. Every failed experiment. None of them were random.”

He gestured around us. “They were warning signs.”

Wind pushed through the trees, low and hollow.

“They’re waking up,” he said.

The words sat between us like a weight.

I wanted to walk away. Pretend none of it mattered.

But the pressure in my skull, the way the creatures had reacted to me—it all lined up too well.

“Then you’d better be ready,” I said.

He gave a humorless laugh. “You think I’m the one who needs to be ready?”

He shook his head.

“They’ll be coming for you, 18C.”

He turned to his men.

“Move out.”

The SUVs pulled away, tail lights vanishing into the dark.

I stood alone in the lot, glass crunching under my boots.

I’d survived.

I’d saved Lily.

I’d killed something wearing my face.

It didn’t feel like winning.

I looked at the treeline.

Something else was still out there.

And Carter was right.

It would come looking for me.

I found Lily an hour later.

She’d holed up in a small hunting cabin two miles off the road. One room. Old furniture. No tech. She’d ditched her phone and wiped down her truck.

When I knocked, a shotgun barrel poked out through the crack of the door.

Then she saw me and let out a breath. “You actually made it.”

“Still here,” I said.

She let me in and locked the door behind us.

“You okay?” she asked.

“No,” I said. “But I’m alive.”

She didn’t argue.

I told her about the mimic. About Carter. About his last warning.

By the time I finished, she was pacing, arms folded tight.

“They just let you go,” she said. “After all that?”

“Yeah.”

“That doesn’t make sense,” she said. “If they wanted you gone, they’d have done it. So why?”

“Because they think they don’t need to chase me anymore,” I said. “Because something worse is already coming.”

She stared at me for a long second.

“Then what do we do?” she asked.

I wanted to say “fight.” Go find whatever was waking up and put it down.

But you can’t hit what you can’t see.

“We go dark,” I said. “No phones. No cards. No patterns. We move. We get ready.”

She sighed. “Guess I’m officially on the run.”

“Welcome to the club,” I said.

We left that night.

Back roads. Cash. Cars we wouldn’t keep.

For a while, it worked.

But the same question kept circling in my head.

What’s waking up?

The things I’d hunted before were monsters, sure—but they were local. Self-contained. They didn’t feel like parts of something bigger.

Carter’s voice wouldn’t leave me.

They weren’t isolated incidents. They were warning signs.

Warning against what?

Lily glanced over at me from the driver’s seat one night as the highway stretched out ahead, empty and dark.

“You look like you’re solving math in your head,” she said.

“Trying to figure out the next move,” I said.

She drummed her fingers on the wheel. “If something bigger is coming, step one is figuring out what it is.”

I nodded.

Because if I understood what was waking up—

Then maybe I could figure out how to kill it

Sry it's long,"I'm a 20 years old female with average BMI. This started 2-3 years ago: I feel dizzy if I don't eat enough/skip meals. If I eat plain fast carbs with dizziness, then I have vertigo for a whole day and nothing helps. If I do a high intensity workout with vertigo I'm also nauseous. It's hard to concentrate when having vertigo. When it's the worst, it's strenuous to think and talk. The dizziness feels like being drunk. I'm very irritable during these episodes. Fasting blood sugar levels were normal and my 3 month average also. In the first year when it started, it was terrible but can't say I was managing it well. I had a pretty bad one when we had PE and I was dizzy. I kinda wished it had been over. And I guess it was for me. I tripped, injuring my ankle. Then, when it was time for breakfast, I ate quick carbs, which made me feel nauseous to the point that I just wanted to lie on the bean bags. So I went upstairs with my injured ankle. In the next year, I felt quite normal, I only had a few of these episodes. I was eating 3 meals and I felt fine. I didn't pay attention to my eating either. Everything was normal except for the few of these episodes. And now, it's terrible again. I try to limit fast carbs and I don't eat sugary things. In a normal situation, I eat every 3 hours but sometimes life happens and I fail at doing so. Once, I woke up to pee in the middle of the night and it was so hard falling asleep again because I was dizzy. Drinking coffee after a meal sometimes helps but it's unpredictable. I have to eat  school food during weekdays, and that doesn't neccessarily help the situation either. The breakfasts there are tipically healthy but lunches aren't always the best. I have period fluctuations. I'm tired all the time. Without breakfast, I feel like I'm half asleep, but a few times it doesn't help and I'm completely unable to concentrate to the extent that I only hear some words, the rest is slurred. It's so hard getting ready in the morning sometimes because I'm incredibly slow. A little snack doesn't help with these episodes (e.g. plain complex carbs). Drinking doesn't relieve constant thirst.

“split ends”
got as many split ends as I do severed ties
no hat trick can ever bring the dead back to life
nor can a savior ever hope to reach me
predestination has a special place in hell for me
heard a stranger in a coffee shop once say it’s all predetermined, that God Himself selects who gets to join Him
If He decides it, you’re destined to spend eternity in flames, no one can rewrite it, you can’t even change your own eternal fate
Pointless hymns inscribed on my skin like the Dead Sea scrolls;
Can’t just pave over my past like the New Testament 
Why was I put on this earth? Just to suffer to no end? How could I ever make an impact when my own life is in shambles?
Sometimes I wish I was born in the age of worldwide wars
At least I would have lived with a sense of purpose, died for a cause,
Went down as somebody worthy of remembrance.
I can’t acclimate to this life, it wasn’t meant for me.
My only escape from it is maladaptive daydreams.
How can you cope with a life that never stops throwing curve balls?
How can you do more than survive when it’s all you’ve ever known?
My stomach is in knots, like intestinal pretzel twists
Don’t eat enough, then overeat, then guilt, shame, repeat 
How am I ever supposed to stand on my own two feet?
Reliant on everybody else except for the one person it should be.
I can’t blame my mom for being an alcoholic,
It’s how she got through the day.
I do the same thing, except with sugar and violent video games.
I’m tired of looking at myself in the mirror,
I see fractured glass split into several alterations.
Reflecting back anger, resentment, fear, and refused assimilation.
I don’t want to be this way.
I don’t want to cling to threads of joy like I’ll never have more of it someday.
But at this point, it’s best to accept that threads are all I deserve.
It’s all I’ve managed to gather, the meager restitution that I’ve earned
Sometimes I pray that death will catch me by surprise. Or maybe that I’ll wake up with new cards dealt to my hand, or a fresh set of eyes, like tires with undamaged tread.
But despite all of my loathing and brooding and self-imposed martyrdom,
I linger; against my will, I remain. A shallow truth for a hollow life, my existence but a stain.
There is nothing more for me but to drown in these watery depths.
To set fire to the gasoline that’s been there since my first breath, pooling at my feet.

\- Battery life is crazy good. It can easily last 2 weeks of full time work and gaming at night and the weekend on a single charge.

\- Connectivity is insane. I can have 2 (maybe more as I haven't tested) non simultaneous bluetooth devices with multipoint connected at the same time, a windows PC with the 2.4 base station, and a 3.5 input jack from my Legion Go S connected to the base station, so 3 devices simultaneous devices in total. It can also be used completely wired.

\- The base station is a bit big, but for my usage it's actually fantastic. I can quickly mute and unmute my headset, I can balance chatmix between my meetings and music or videos playing, control sidetone, change EQ's, mute, etc.

\- Sound quality, specially after EQ, is pretty damn good. It compares favorably to the Maxwell (yeah not as good but still very very good).

\- Microphone is it's weakest point, but it's still solid. Sidetone works great (not noisy).

\- In headset controls are decent, but they could be better, like having a separate bluetooth volume, ability to switch EQ profiles, etc).

\- Connection stability and range is fantastic. I can listen in a call and go to a separate room to make a coffee and maintain perfect connection, couldn't do that with the Maxwell without degrading quality, and less so even with the other options I tried. Also, different than the Astro A50 X, the bluetooth is in the main unit so you can use it completely independently of the base station.

\- It's the most comfortable headset I've ever used. It's not heavy and the weird material it has for the earpads is super soft and comfortable.

\- Noise isolation isn't great so the qualifier would be that this is great from WFH but maybe not for a loud/busy office, although it's probably good enough for a moderately quiet workspace for when I'm in my actual office in person.

We were travelling since 12:00. Alam mo naman traffic sa Manila at this time. Like super tagal ng traffic. Fault rin naman namin. We should have taken the expressway. I thought no-traffic kasi nga kasi di naman rush hour. I'm not a frequent traveler so I didn't know how bad traffic were.

Anyways, by the time na naka-alis na kami sa traffic congested areas, it was already 8:00 so we decided to eat na rin sa certain Jolibee branch since pagod nga and ayaw na nila magluto.

Simple lang naman order namin eh. Medyo relevant sa reason why gigil ako so I'm putting it here.

* 2x 1pc burger steak meal
* 1x 1 pcs chicken meal (my dad's order)
* 1x 1 pcs chicken with spag
* 1x hot coffee (separate order na takeout to kasi gusto ko sana coffee for the road)

Anyways, they said 18 minutes. It's fine. No issue there. We waited for like 25 minutes before the first serving was brought to our table. I have no problem with those kinds of delays so it's fine. Server said:

>""Sir, wait lang po yung isang order""

Akala ko naman kukunin nya lang and nasa serving area na so we decided to eat na kasi gutom na rin kami. 10 minutes passed and natapos na ako sa pagkain ko pero wala pa yung order ni Papa. Another 10 minutes passed, tapos na kami lahat pero wala pa order ni Papa. Di naman complicated order ni Papa. No special request. 1pcs chicken and rice lang. May chicken din naman yung isang order. May rice din yung dalawa. Hard to see why mag kakadelay.

This time, inis na inis na ako. Anong wait lang po yang sinasabi mo?

I went to the serving area asking for updates sa order namin. Wait lang daw tapos nag ask din ako sa update sa coffee order ko. Nung nag ask ako for updates lang sila nag start mag brew. So if hindi ako nag ask, di yun dadating?

Di ako masama manalita pero kitang kita mo talaga gigil ko. Tapos yung mga nag peprep pa dun, ang sama ng tingin sakin na parang ako pa yung atat. Like sorry ha? Almost 1 hr na wala pa yung order ni Papa tapos 30 minutes since nagsimula na kami kumain.

Anyways, tumayo lang ako sa serving area asking for updates. Dumating after like 5 minutes tapos wait lang daw coffee ko which came in another 10 minutes

Anyways, here's the timeline rounded to 5 minutes:

* 8:10: nag order
* 8:35: first batch. (3 meals)
* 8:45: natapos ako
* 9:00: natapos na kami lahat except si Papa and pumunta ako sa serving area asking for updates
* 9:05: dun lang dumating order ni Papa
* 9:15: dumating coffee ko
* 9:20: tapos na si Papa so umalis na kami.

No offense sa mga crew at the time. I know pagod na pagod na kayo but if you said 18 minutes wait time, maging honest kayo instead of mag-aantay kami for 1 hr. Kung sinabi nyo sana na 1hr pa, we could have gone to McDo just on the other side of the street.",1,1765910112.0,GigilAko,1,1.0,False

I was in standard 1 and it was probably the first few weeks of school ever for me. I went out to go to the bathroom and out of nowhere I got the feeling that I had to turn around. Then I saw her. She was walking the other way but she had her head turned as well. She was, in my 7 year old head, the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. I got flustered and I could feel my ears getting red while the wind blew past it and my ears felt cold. After I got rejected I dedicated all of my soul to losing weight for her but in the end I still wasn't enough but I guess it wasn't her fault. I was such a fucking idiot back then. I remember one time there was something going on in class and everybody was surrounding a table and I went over and put my arm on her shoulder like we were close friends. Ah, so embarrassing. But that was probably what made her hate me so much. Now I can't fall in love. I thought if I'd talk to a girl enough I'd get to love her for the small things. But I don't know. I don't have any motivation to do anything anymore. I used to live for cycling, y'know? I had a great bike and I'd go cycling with my dad every weekend. I'd go running too. Now every sport I do I have to make up a really strong reason and force myself to see it through. And I can't say for sure I'm depressed because there's plenty of people out there who genuinely are, so I don't want to put myself into the same category as people who are hurt way more than I am. It's all bottling up. At this point, I don't even know what I'm upset about anymore. I just am. There's no real joy behind the laughs I have nowadays. I miss myself. This isn't me, y'know? I used to be such a happy dude even if I came off as an asshole to some of my friends. But I was happy. I wasn't angry or sad about anything ever. I never held grudges and I still don't to this day. It's just that everything's been piling on me and I don't know how to put it down because I don't know what to put down so I spend hours upon hours here with you trying to put my finger on it and hopefully find myself again but I'm afraid he's gone now. 7 year old me wanted to grow up so bad but if he knew this was what was waiting, I'm sure he'd be happy staying back even if I'm buffer and better in every sense except mentally. I've made so many mistakes that stayed with me and now they've conformed into this fucking gross mountain of shit that I have to carry. I want to put it down and I want to move on. I just don't know how. I wish I could go back in time. Back when I was still so young, still had to beg my parents for a phone before I bought myself one. Still running around so happily and eating mi hun keuh with my mom early in the morning before she took me to school. Still sitting in that coffee shop with my dad and that cool waiter that fist bumped me. I didn't smoke back then. I didn't need to. Now it's all gone to shit.",1,1765910082.0,KindVoice,1,1.0,False

# Introduction

  
Welcome to the definitive Caramel Column Pilgrimage Guide. For all the most diehard of ALTER EGO, AZNANA, and Caramel Column in general, this is a guide to not only Caramel Column's own locations in Japan, but also to many of their related establishments.

  
Having personally made treks to each location to document things, I hope this guide can serve as the foundations for your own personal trip to experiencing these places, should you choose to undertake them. Not every location is photographed - Reddit does have an image cap, after all, but each location will be explained for their importance to our favorite gaming company. 

# Offices

Over the years, Caramel Column has had many offices situated all over the Kanto prefecture. Their tenures present at the locations will be marked below.

1. **JAM Akihabara** \- Images 3-5. The birthplace of Caramel Column. Before the set up of a proper office, the founders of Caramel Column would gather at this modest maid cafe in the center of Akihabara to eat and enjoy their free wi-fi service. I can personally attest to the location's impeccable professionalism, reasonability in food quality and pricing, and friendliness of the workers. 
2. **South Ikebukuro Office** (06/02/2014?)\~(02/05/2015?) - Sun Heights Ikebukuro 503, Image 6. Caramel Column's first office more closely resembles a typical apartment complex seen all over Japan. While it was a relatively short tenure there, the location is nonetheless important as being the place where everything began. It was here that Caramel Column worked on many of their first major projects, including producing the Akihabara area free magazine ""Aki-Colle."" Due to insufficient archiving, the exact time the office became out of use is unknown. 
3. **Awajicho Office** (02/05/2015?\~05/30/2016) - Shizuwa Building 2B, Image 7. Caramel Column's second office is far closer to what one may imagine a normal office to appear as. It was here that Caramel Column continued their work as an outsourcing firm and partner for a variety of game developers in Japan. However, their major breakthroughs wouldn't come around until their next location...
4. **Jinbocho Office** (05/30/2016\~05/01/2024) - Maruni Building 301, Image 8. What is now a Heart Nails manicure salon was, at one point, Caramel Column's longest-lived office, and the spot where they created so many of their innovative and new characters and games. From THE Overtime, to ALTER EGO, onto Insectarium, and finally to Aznana and beyond. This was also, of course, the site of my [first and only in-person interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTempleOfEs/comments/14j7h44/visiting_caramel_column_20230620/) with the team as well. If anything, before the office was vacated, the ALTER EGO subreddit left its mark on the location with questions and things from the users.
5. **Yokohma Office** (05/01/2024\~Present) - Premier Yokohma 3F BIZcomfort, Image 9. Caramel Column's current office is more of a spot-meeting location than a long-term physical office. Already being rather innovative even in their early years, Caramel Column has long adopted a flexible work schedule for their employees, with no set checking time. As an extension of this philosophy, they have since gone full remote, with the new office being simply an address for deliveries and occasional meetings.

# ALTER EGO Locations

Being a game a long time in the making, ALTER EGO has many important locations tied to it all around Tokyo. Although many of these locations no longer physically exist, their legacy as places that, at one point, facilitated the creation of one of the greatest games is not to be overlooked.

1. **Bar DRESDEN** \- B1 floor, 3-22-1 Shinjuku (old location), Images 10-11. New location image 12. The birthplace of ALTER EGO. On a chilly evening in the January of 2018, a drunk Maki ONO thought of wanting to create something of his very own at this very bar. The next day, he began work on the plans for ALTER EGO. The original location of the bar no longer exists - the building it resided within was demolished and combined with the one next to it.
2. **Saint Marc Cafe Jinbocho Suzuran Dori store** \- Image 12. A homely chain cafe known for their croissants, Maki ONO spent many a night working on the script for ALTER EGO at this store.
3. **Denny's Kanda Ogawacho store** \- Images 13-14. A late-night family restaurant in Japan, another location where the creation of ALTER EGO's script continued at. The restaurant and the building that housed it no longer exists - only a walled-off section and undeveloped land remains, but that is indeed another location that facilitated ALTER EGO's creation. 
4. **Mendokoro Maruwa** \- Images 15-17. A privately-owned ramen shop in Chiba, this was the site that hosted the [ALTER EGO Tantanmen collaboration event](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheTempleOfEs/comments/1dxzemr/mendokoro_maruwa_5_years_after_collab/). A store with delicious and reasonably priced food, as well as an incredibly passionate owner, definitely visit here when you have a chance!
5. **ANIMATE Ikebukuro** \- Not Pictured. The ANIMATE main store in Ikebukuro housed displays for ALTER EGO during their collaboration with A3/EEO Store to create anniversary products. The same would be true later on for AZNANA as well.
6. **Mt. Takao** \- Not pictured. The legendary Mt. Takao was subject to many memes and references for the ALTER EGO community for a time, namely due to its inclusion in the ALTER EGO Line Stamp packs as a joke insert. Climbing the mountain itself won't offer you any ALTER EGO-related insights, but perhaps a relaxing trek through nature may aid in your self-discovery. 
7. **STORIA** \- Not pictured. On 06/30/2019, this cafe, run by Square Enix, was the host to the one-day ALTER EGO Self-Discovery Cafe event, featuring presentations from Maki ONO and Amiko. The location itself is long-defunct and torn down.
8. **Ito Stationary Store** **Rikuzentaka Location** \- Not Pictured. In 2019, this bookstore ran a collaboration with ALTER EGO to sell the books featured in the game, decorated with an Obi that utilized the game's illustrations for each title.

# AZNANA Locations

1. **Yaguchi Bookstore** \- The inspiration behind AZNANA's Libro. This vintage bookstore in Jinbocho is a local landmark and features very reasonable prices behind their selections.
2. **Cafe Ensignedangle** \- This chain cafe's silverware inspired the design of AZNANA's beloved barista character, Mr. Barista. Their coffee is rather tasty even for those who may not have a taste for such flavors. 

In time, there may be more locations to discover - more information to find regarding everyone's favorite gaming corporation, Caramel Column. For now though, this is what is available. Hopefully this has been an entertaining and educational read, and I hope the guide serves as a resource for those who may seek to partake in their own pilgrimage to these locations.

Hi! My name is Stephanie! I’m 35 and live in Western Canada (Specifically - Alberta). I am hoping to make a new online friend that is fun/funny, genuine, willing/able to put effort into conversations(I will do the same!). I would prefer to chat with people around my age, or older(please no one under 30!), that is able to text/write full words lol - a bit of slang is cool, but I can’t do the whole “u” instead of “you” thing etc all the time! 

Some things I enjoy that could give an idea if we have interests in common, or just to start a conversation: music! My favorite band is blink 182, and has been since I was 14 - also pretty into Alkaline Trio, mgk, Taylor Swift etc etc. I enjoy shopping and getting my nails done - I see a very talented nail tech that makes all my nail art dreams a reality. I love coffee, movie and tv shows, with a preference for anything horror. I love to exercise daily, and love to go for long walks. Other things too, but I don’t want to give everything away here, or make this intro too long. 

If this interests you and you’d like to have a chat, please send me a message and introduce yourself !

I have been on Oahu before to visit a friend but she lived further north so this is a completely different experience. I’m very much interested in being a respectful tourist. That said, I absolutely did not even consider renting a car lol which I’m beating myself up about. Want to try and make the most of my trip anyway! 

We hiked Diamond Head yesterday, and mostly have been doing a lot of walking and perusing. We are planning Iolani Palace today, Bishop Museum Friday, and probably going to try to do some snorkeling near the hotel one day. Was also going to walk to downtown-ish area, really want to check out Skull-Face Books and Vinyl. My partner bought us tickets to the luau at the PCC, which I learned is owned by the LDS church. 🙄 There’s a few other things I’ve wanted to do but they’re on other parts on the island so not sure if it’s reasonable to get there without a car.

I am looking to make a career switch that enables me to travel more, I've been working in the service industry for many years and am currently the assistant manager at a coffee shop. One profession that keeps sneaking into my mind and has done so for years is becoming a flight attendant. I am located in Amsterdam and have been looking at cabin crew opportunities at KLM, however I currently do not meet their requirements when it comes to my high school diploma (cause of circumstances I wasn't able to graduate but I did follow the level they're asking for). I am working fulltime but I am motivated and willing to go back to school next to work to obtain the needed diploma in the upcoming year and follow my dream to become a flight attendant. My question is for all flight attendants: What do you absolutely love about your job? I can imagine it's not always fun, work days are long and no job is perfect, but what makes being a flight attendant worth it for you? And specifically for KLM flight attendants, I would love to hear a little bit more about the selection process and things to keep in mind, some tips to prepare myself and set myself up for success when I apply for my dream job.

39 year old American male in the Midwest. Writer, reader, burrito guru.

Looking for a book pal who enjoys talking about music, movies, food, life, dreams, everything.

\- The Sign of the Beaver (rocked that out in the 4th grade)

\- 11/22/63

\- Colton Gentry's Third Act

\- Anything Emily Henry

\- Legends and Lattes series

\- ACOTAR

Having a book buddy who can not only discuss their favorite book but who enjoys talking about their whole lives. 

I enjoy singer/songwriter and Americana music the most but love everyone from Tool to Garth Brooks. I experience hardcore FOMO whenever a special edition snack or beverage comes out - have you had the Holiday Creamy Vanilla Coke yet?!? I try to stay pop culture savvy but, no, I can’t tell you what “6,7” means.

Making people laugh and introducing new obsessions are my passion.

I dip my fries in my soft serve ice cream. I cry and I’m not ashamed to share it. Christmas is my jam. Animals, historically, are better than people.

Coffee and loaded teas fuel my life. I might have a touch of the ‘tism. I genuinely seek a connection that serves as a foundation for years of friendship and closeness.

(McCarran & Lakeside is dark AGAIN)","Look, we all laughed at the AI bot writer. You know the one—ranting about the evils of organized labor and the sanctity of the Siren. We thought it was just a glitch in the matrix, a few lines of code that drank too much dark roast.

But I drove by McCarran and Lakeside this morning, and the lights are off. Again.

Apparently, the baristas were busy protesting at a roasting plant yesterday, and then decided to bring the festivities to the store location in the afternoon. Now? The drive-thru is a ghost town.

So, I’m starting to think the bot might be onto something. Not the part about unions being bad (nice try, Skynet), but the part about the inevitable collapse of the Pumpkin Spice Empire. The bot predicted chaos! The bot predicted a coffee vacuum!

Here is my modest, totally silly proposal to restore balance to the universe:

Since Starbucks clearly can't handle the heat, we need a hostile takeover. I propose we hand the keys over to a local, independent coffee shop.

But here is the kicker—just to really mess with the AI bot's algorithm—we make it the most aggressively unionized local shop in existence.

I’m talking:

• The Hub or Old World, but run as an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

• Baristas who have tenure and a pension plan.

• Espresso shots pulled by a committee vote.

It’s the perfect solution. We get better coffee, the workers get their rights, and the anti-union AI bot short-circuits from the irony.

Who's with me? I just need a caffeine fix that doesn't involve crossing a picket line or driving to the next Starbucks (which is, admittedly, only 400 feet away).

Walking through the streets studded with Christmas glow, full of people, hearts and minds you will never know. Street cars passing in the night. Intimacy starved lonely lovers in one of the most romantic ideas that we call New Orleans. Most people are fine being alone with themselves and many have even found contentment in it – or do we just tell ourselves that to survive? Society now acknowledges how hard it is for single middle-aged men these days; not saying it’s any easier for single middle-aged women because I wouldn’t know. 

Speed dating though, our days are full of it – a short conversation at the store, a pleasant interaction at the bus stop. An attractive woman rushing through the crosswalk; though admittedly that is more like Tinder, even though you swipe right in your mind, she will never see your profile so to speak. Forced to live out our romantic dreams within our own minds because society frowns on people expressing interest in continuing a conversation beyond the time limits set by the current errand at hand. We have learned not to say “I’ve really enjoyed talking to you, would you mind if I buy you a coffee sometime?” because THAT might be unwelcome and aggressive. 

How many times have you just say with someone you cared about and were so comfortable with that you didn’t need to speak? You were just there… existing together, enjoying a shared experience such as the nostalgic song that neither of you have heard in over a decade. How many dates are simply that… people watching a movie together… not speaking. If that’s all it takes, how many dates have YOU and I been on and didn’t even realize?

Walking through the streets studded with Christmas glow, we were lonely together and didn’t even know. Would you like to get that coffee sometime?",1,1765909297.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

Some people cannot make change, I get that, but if someone hands you 500 in any currency for a coffee that costs 90....

How could any rational person just hand all of the change back and not think twice?

Something about that interaction seemed extra manufactured/arranged. Am I nuts?",9,1765909188.0,90DayFiance,11,0.8,False
1po9blt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrainFog/comments/1po9blt/brain_fog_2_years_after_covid_finally_found/,Brain fog 2 years after covid - finally found something that actually worked,"Covid got me in march 2023 and honestly thought the brain fog would just... go away after a few months? Spoiler: it didn't. Not like I can't function but it's constant thing where I read something for work and realize I've gone through the same paragraph like three times and still couldn't tell you what it said. Or standing in rooms wondering why I walked in there. The worst was my experience with video calls where I couldn’t understand the whole phrase and have to ask people to repeat themselves.

Tried the whole supplement thing. B12, fish oil, coq10, lions mane for maybe 2 months. Helped a little I think? Honestly hard to tell when you're testing on yourself. Modafinil made me too anxious anyway and couldn't sleep. Actually wait the sleep thing might've been from too much coffee on top of it idk scratch that.

So I started reading about ISR (integrated stress response I think?) and how after viral infections your neurons basically get stuck in this defensive mode. They stop making proteins properly. Which would explain why just resting doesn't fix anything because the system is literally locked. Btw need to check if that eLife study was 2020 or 2019. Anyway this led me to ISRIB A15.

I must say that I was skeptical, like extremely skeptical. But after months of nothing working I figured why not. Started with 5mg, felt nothing first two days. Day three or four something shifted. wasn't dramatic just... the mud cleared? Like my brain wasn't fighting itself anymore. Reading actually stuck. Could hold conversations without that lag.

It's been about 5 weeks now and the difference is honestly weird to describe. Not a stimulant feeling at all, more like whatever block was there just isn't anymore. Managed to get through an entire technical document yesterday without rereading anything. That hasn't happened since before covid. Brain was under this constant pressure and now it's just... not!

Unrelated but not medical advice obviously just sharing what happened for me. Still researching the mechanism stuff. But if post viral fog is actually this ISR thing staying activated then it makes sense why rest alone didn't fix it right? The system was stuck, ISRIB А15 unstuck it.

Anyone else dealing with long covid cognitive stuff? Curious if others tried this route or found something else that worked. Feel like I'm finally not running through mud anymore.",3,1765909187.0,BrainFog,12,0.71,False
