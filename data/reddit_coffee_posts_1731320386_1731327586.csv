After over a month of dry weather, it rained this morning. The air felt refreshed, as if **nature was casting its magic** to bring life back into everything. Though it's still not cold, the cool breeze and light rain added a touch of winter's promise. 🌧️

I managed to wake up at 4:30 today, finally beating that unconscious part of my mind that always wants ""just a little more sleep."" Instead, I made myself a hot **Starbucks Pike Roast**—a nice change that felt just right for the weather. Let's see if I can keep this habit going! ☕😊

Walking in Philly was peaceful, the rain and breeze making everything feel a little more alive. But, as always, my mind was busy—*Is it normal to have so many thoughts?* Decision-making has always been a bit of a challenge for me, with my mind constantly weighing two options.

Lately, I'm trying a new approach: **whenever I'm torn between two choices, I go with my first instinct**. For example, should I take the train to work, or should I drive to another office? Instead of overthinking, I'm choosing the first option that comes to mind. Let’s see how this shapes up! 🌅

Here’s a small glimpse from the office—capturing the quiet, productive atmosphere that Mondays bring. 🖥️🌆

Placed between the borders of Germany and Poland, it has survived for over 500 years in a rough environment as you can imagine. Yet the most defining part of the city is not what the blind see, it is those with the Sight can see. If you look beyond the shroud, a magical world will be opened to you, filled with fantastical creature flying between skyscrapers, and dragon-born lawyers preparing a coffee while getting ready for work. The G.U.I.L.D. has recently reopened, hoping some bright and fresh mind are able to assist the city with its matters. Matters related to scheming, thieving, pinching and a dark creature looking over the city, wishing to claim it's revenge on the protector of it all.

1goqmns,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1goqmns/weird_situation_and_sorry_this_is_a_long_story/,Weird Situation and Sorry This Is A Long Story," It all started when we met in college last year. We were working on the same project, exchanged phone numbers, got along pretty well, and started texting every so often. I didn’t ask her, but she mentioned she had a boyfriend, and I didn’t say anything about having feelings for her (which I do) and carried on with the rest of the school year.
One year later, on a random night, I hadn’t thought about this girl since college, but all of a sudden she came to mind, and I was thinking, 'I wonder what she’s up to.' The next day, she followed me on Instagram! I was like, there’s no way—I was just thinking about her, and the next day she followed me. I was so happy. I followed her back, and we started talking and getting along great.
A couple of days later, she asked me, 'Do you like me?' and I said, 'Yes, I do like you…' She mentioned she broke up with her boyfriend a month ago. When she told me that, I was thrilled; she also mentioned that the reason she was being distant with me before was because she was catching feelings for me and didn’t want to ruin her relationship, which I totally understood. Then, in almost every text she sent, she started repeating the last letter of words, like 'Awwww' or 'Totallyyyyy.'
Now we’ve started to flirt with each other, and I wanted to do random things with her, like going to a movie theater or restaurant. She even wanted me to go with her to her friend’s wedding as her plus-one, lol. I hadn’t seen her for a while, so she invited me to come by her work, where she’d give me a free coffee. Before I went, I bought her a bag of her favorite candy and decorated it with our favorite football teams. When I arrived, my heart was racing—I couldn’t believe my crush from college liked me. As soon as I walked in, she smiled and gave me a hug, and she really liked the gift I gave her. We talked when she was on her break, and I noticed some good body language—when a girl gets shy or nervous, she often plays with her hair, which she did. We talked for about twenty minutes, and when her break was almost over, she walked me to my car. We hugged twice, and they were long hugs. I thanked her for the coffee, and I was on my way home.
Before we met up, she’d told me her parents are strict and that she wanted to focus on herself before starting to date again, and I was cool with that. At this point in the story, you’re probably thinking, 'Okay, there’s no way this story can get weird, right?' But the next day, I texted her to say thanks again for last night and that I hoped she enjoyed her candy. She replied, 'You’re welcome, and thank you for the candy.' I asked about her day, and she said it went well. Then she texted me this:
'I also spoke with my parents right now and told them about you and I just you know hanging out but my parents don’t think it’s good for me right now to be talking with someone cause they ya know assume and were right I have some feelings for you but they think it’s too soon because of the break up and honestly they might be right (my name), you’re the sweetest and super caring trust me when I say that but I know my parents at the end of the day want what’s best for me, and plz don’t hate me but they’re making my brother go with me to the wedding since he’s already gonna be in town, I’m so so sorry I promise its nothing against you, I just know that they’re right maybe it’s best if I do just focus on myself right now and I would have told you this in person but they just told me right now and I wouldn’t want to wait to do that, that’s not right, if you ever want a free coffee though lol you’re more than happy to visit me or come to me with any advice I just need to figure out some things right now I’m sorry.'
I replied, 'Thank you for being honest with me, I could never hate you, I totally understand where your parents are coming from, and I respect your decision to focus on yourself right now, just know that I care about you and I’m here if you ever want to talk or hang out, even if it’s just for coffee, take your time to figure things out, and I’ll be here when you’re ready.' She responded, 'Thank you (my name), I really appreciate that.'
We haven’t texted for a month, but she posted something on Instagram of her at the wedding. When I saw it, it had been up for a few hours. I liked the post but didn’t say anything. Later that night, after work, I noticed she had unfollowed me on Instagram when I checked my profile and saw my follower count had dropped and this happened yesterday and also, she didn’t block me on Instagram. What should I do, and does this mean anything?",1,1731326612.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

Went out for coffee with an old friend -- we go out once a month and talk about hobbies, work, stuff in general.  Met her back when our sons were in the same 1st grade class \~ten years ago.  Since then her son got into chess and math and computer games while mine wants to do nothing but play sports, so the boys lost touch as they grew older.  Always considered her a friend bc that year of his 1st grade was hard for me to separate from my son (another story, but it all turned out OK).

Anyway, she's got 3 other kids -- all older and high-energy compared to mine -- at coffee she started talking about how her oldest kid (\~30 yo M who I don't know) won't see her or talk to her or to her husband (his dad).  The stuff she said was surreal.  I felt like Alice through the Looking Glass.  She has \*nO IdEa wHy\* he cut ties.  I pressed, trying to get at the missing-missing-reasons but nope, stone-cold baffled she is.

She starts talking about what a tRaDgeDy it is that his kids (who he hasn't had yet or maybe ever) will not know their grandparents (""oh and after they grow up you are going to say 'you had grandparents and cousins who you never knew about or saw') and how ITS JUST NOT RIGHT!!! ---all the greatest BPD hits.

Still processing.  I did not enable and advised her to give him space.  Of course she did not cannot hear a word I said.

1goqltu,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1goqltu/is_this_a_warning_sign_should_i_be_concerned/,Is this a warning sign? Should I be concerned?,"I'm 35 and I have checked my blood sugar on and off over the past few years just out of sheer curiosity.

Typical results were anywhere from about: 4.9 to 6 fasting forst thing in the morning and post prandial was generally always inder 7. Later, about a year and a half ago, sometimes my levels would ahoot as high as 9 if I hadn't eaten all day and had something like a large bag of chips and buttered bun. This caused me sone concern as i'd never seen them so high.

Three days ago, after not testing for a year and a half, my morning fasting level was 6.5, yesterday was 6.7. But I checked after having lunch and then dinner yesterday too.

Yesterday foods was:
breakfast
2 black coffees
3/4 cup sweet cream I get from a local farm

Lunch:
5 air fried halloumi fries, 5 air fried potato smiley
Whole tin of baked beans with about 100g full block butter, 1/2 tap coconut oil and about 100g cheese added to it
1 cup of orange juice.

I checked 90 mins after eating and my levels shot up to 9.8. That's the highest ao ever recorded it. After two hours it went down to 8.4.

Then for dinner I had a large bowl of himalayan style chilli cheese and a large indian style flat bread, made with triple cheese and lathered in butter. 

I checked an hour after eating and my level was at 6.8, then went down to 6.4 two hours after eating.

More than twelve hours later, I check my fasting level and it was at 7.

How is my fasting level higher than post dinner? I checled again am hour later, still fasting and the level was at 5.5.

Does this sound like cause for concern?

Some points to note - 
I haven't really done any proper exercise in years. Yesterday after dinner I went for a 1/2 mile walk which may have helped with control.

Again, this morning, between when the levels were 7 and 5.5 I walked half a mile and back to the shop to pick up some smokes. But that's when spmething weird happened - I felt hungry and a bit dizzy. Usually on weekdays I don't have any breakfast at all and can put eating lunch till about 4pmvif I have to without feeling hungry or dizzy.
I think maybe this was the first time this has ever happened to me.

I don't really understand what is happening. They said that the dawn effect should make you cranky, weak but in all honesty I feel very energised up on waking. Usually, as in the past years when I check my levels to be normal - 4->6 I would feel cranky and weak.

Only difference is I have started adding a multivitamin to my daily routine if I remember to take it.

I also wonder if having lots of fat in your doet might be classed as cheating here. I heard that fat slows down gasteic emptying, and this blood sugar levels too. Should I try this again with pure glucose or plain white rice or something and without exercise to get a more accurate picture. How much glucose or rice should I use?

1goqbm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1goqbm6/my_friends_husband_seems_to_want_me_to_be_his/,My friend's husband seems to want me to be his confidante through their marital issues and it's making me uncomfortable,"I (39F) recently reconnected with my best friend (40F) from uni times whom I had had to distance myself from. We had a falling out because, in our mid- to late twenties, she introduced me to a group of people she used to party with, and some of the men were attracted to me, inlcuding my future boyfriend (who turned out to be physically abusive and is now an ex) and her current husband (in his 40sM). My friend got very jealous over that as it opened up some core wounds for her, and she began to behave horridly towards me so that I had to take my distance from her. Suffice it to say that I wasn't all too hopeful about her mental health and that of the people she surrounds herself with (seeing as her husband was at least still friendly with my abusive ex).

Now, I have just gone through another breakup bc my recent ex (37M) has started taking meth again (I know, I know ... but he was clean for 8 of our 9 years together) and is trying to relive his younger years. Shortly before the breakup, I had reconnected with my friend and her husband, and she had apologized to me for being such a b-word to me all those years back, saying that, if there's one thing in her life she'll regret until her dying day, it's this, and that she really misses me and appreciates that I never judged her for her partying ways and the scrapes she got up to, and that she shouldn't have judged me for being young and in high spirits and thus attractive to others.

She is freshly separated from her husband, which I found out when I visited her to have a chat and go out to dance with her this Saturday. The evening/ night went well, although I went home to their apartment before she did around 7 in the morning (this is in Germany, it's quite normal here for parties to last into the morning hours, especially where they live). I was supposed to stay at their apartment, but I had already suspected that, with there being two kids of 4 and 7 in the household, I wouldn't be sleeping much. Sure enough, as soon as I turned the key in the lock and opened the door, ever so quietly, I found myself face to face with the older child. She thought it was her mom coming home. So we made small talk, I introduced myself to her and explained that her mom was getting breakfast somewhere (which was true) and would she like to look at the presents I brought for her and her sister. So we both brushed our teeth and cleaned our faces and settled down in the living room to chat and play. The husband made breakfast for everybody and the little one got up as well. I was focusing on getting to know these kids so much of whose lives I had missed and whom I would have practically been an aunt to if I hadn't fallen out with my friend. 

Whenever the husband could, though, he tried to ask me where his wife was, if she was having an affair and just commiserate because of my recent breakup and his situation. They are somewhat similar, I cannot deny that. My ex is high on meth and stalking teenagers and other young folks to come out to party with him (I swear it's the drugs) and, to my friend's husband, it seems like she, too, is trying to relive her youth and partying days. He often doesn't know when she'll be back, gets worried that she is with other men, and so on. The difference is I really didn't know where my ex was many nights and I hadn't neglected my household duties or my partner like my friend's husband did. Also, it seems they take turns going out to party with friends while the other stays home with the kids. My friend has admitted to having been blackout-drunk a couple of times this fall though. I do understand his worry and know hw nice it is t talk to people who understand, because not everybody does understand substance abuse disorders (though I don't know if she has one, they both drink at weekends).

My friend came home around 9. Neither of us were drunk around the kids, just tired. I hadn't drunk more than two beers and a very light longdrink in the beginning of the night anyway, and that had been more than 8 hours ago. Since I'd had coffee enough to make my way home, I took my leave then.

The husband has since contacted me to thank me for being sympathetic and could he contact me from time to time to talk and would I agree to keep it secret from my former best friend. I see a lot of potential for mess here (which is why I went into a bit of detail) that I do not want to be caught in the middle of. Also, I feel like I have JUST reconnected with this friend and it feels like he's asking me to jeopardize this friendship, just at a time in my life when I can use all the friends I can get, but maybe that's a selfish view. I understand his pain and that he apparently has no emotional support among his friends, but maybe he should pick better friends (and maybe so should I, oh dear). How do I word my refusal? Thanks for reading, appreciate it!

TL;DR: My friend, whom I have a troubled history with and just recently tentatively reconnected with, is facing marital issues and has separated from her husband. He, not having any other support and knowing that I have recently gone through a breakup, wants to talk to me from time to time and keep it secret from his wife. I do NOT want to be in the middle of this and am contemplating how to word my refusal. I do commiserate with him and our experiences are somewhat similar and I'm wondering if I could offer some support/ sympathy without jeopardizing my friendship. Am also wondering if it's worth rekindling this friendship after all and know that I have to tread very carefully.",2,1731325465.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

The entire time he has been with me he has never had any potty issues with not using the litter box. In February he was diagnosed with diabetes after some steroids he took for an acute illness. This means he is no longer able to be free fed and just be regimented with his insulin doses until (hopefully) the diabetes resolves. He is fed 4 small meals throughout the day through an automatic wet food dispenser. This is where the litter box comes in. He still religiously pees in one of the boxes, there are multiple in different locations (opened and closed). But now in the morning when he decides it is time to get up or he thinks he should get more food he has started pooping beside the bed, or in front of the bathroom door or behind the couch. It all depends on where I am. He will give you about a 2 minute warning where he will meow really loudly and directly and if you aren’t at attention for his demands he is pooping right there. Sometimes I am sleeping, sometimes getting ready for work, sometimes having coffee on the couch. The location is always in relation to where I am at the moment. This is really not fun because who wants to pick up turds every morning or be woken up by the smell. But also I live in an apartment and he is meowing LOUD.  He has seen the vet. She says this is not diabetes related but behavioral. However when I ask about solutions she just sort of shrugs. He is already eating more than recommended servings, he cannot have more. I got the automatic feeder thinking if I could get him to disconnect me with feeding him it would stop. I don’t give in to try to teach him this isn’t effective and well also because the feeder is literally on a timer so he must wait. I do not know what to do.",1,1731325418.0,AskVet,2,1.0,False

1goq96a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1goq96a/virtual_relationship/,Virtual Relationship,"I started talking to a girl 8 months ago that lived very far away from me. She knew my parents from the church they attended. She was engaged with someone then suddenly broke it off but stayed friends with him. She had heard a lot about me from my father so she requested me on Facebook and I accepted. We started to chat back and forth for a while then exchanged phone numbers. While we’re were chatting, she let me know that her and her ex were going to try to work things out with one another but she was confused about it and said that if she really wanted it to work out with him then why would she be talking to me?  

We texted and talked on the phone for hours and hours everyday for 2 months and fell in love “virtually”.  We had a lot in common and started to plan out our future plans together. Crazy enough, we were even talking about marriage and how many kids we wanted to have. We couldn’t get enough of each other and couldn’t wait to meet in person.

I planned a trip to fly out and see her in early May for 10 days. I rented a vehicle and drove straight to her apartment. I wasn’t even out of my car yet and she walked up to me with the biggest smile, she said my name, leaned  into the window and she kissed me with the most passionate kiss I’d ever had in my entire life. 

She made me dinner, which was a surprise and we were both so happy that we were finally together at last.  We spent every single minute together for 6 days.  We had a party for my parents anniversary so she met the rest of my family. I thought that everything was going great and didn’t have any reason to think otherwise. We had sex everyday and I already knew that she wanted to wait until we got married. I couldn’t see myself waiting that long and I guess I fucked that up. 

The last day I was with her I got up early and went to get some coffee for us. When I got back, I gave her her coffee and said “I love you” like I always did. She said, I know “my name”. I was shocked to hear her say that and I said let’s talk. She told me that she didn’t love me like I loved her. I was completely lost for words. I asked her why and she didn’t really have a good reason. I left shortly afterwards and told her that I’d talk to her later. The next day she texted me that she was going back to where she had grown up and that she was sorry that it didn’t work out between us. 

I had a few days left to stay so I spent the rest of my vacation with my parents. I was in complete depression for 2 months. I still think about her every single day and I’m still upset how the way she ended it. I texted her 1 week later and she was very delayed with her responses. I could tell that she didn’t want to talk to me. She ended up ghosting me but we were still friends on Instagram and Facebook. 5 weeks later she blocked me from Instagram and I asked her why. No reply. I then told her to block me from everything and that I couldn’t believe that she would do this to me. She did block me from everything but within a couple hours she unblocked me from her phone because it eventually said “delivered”. It’s getting close to 6 months now since we’ve talked and I’m doing ok but I still have feelings for her. 

I wouldn’t recommend ever meeting someone this way. We moved too fast and it fucked it all up. I’m sure that she’s probably dating someone else now and it’s a good thing that I can’t see that because it would make things worse. I’ll never forget about her as long as I live. We were both living in a dream world and it fizzled away after we met. 

I know that this happens to people that meet online and it doesn’t work out if you wait too long to meet because there’s so many expectations that you both have. If we had met in person without talking for 2 months, it might have went differently. I’ll never do this again. I feel for all of you that are currently going through a hard time from a breakup. 

On a positive note, I’ve been going to the gym for 5 months and I’ve never looked better. I spend my time with friends and have taken up a couple new hobbies. I look at this as a learning experience. We all have to learn from our mistakes in life. Not everyone stays in our lives forever. I won’t give up. If I stay single for a while then that’s ok too. Good luck to everyone.

Initially I was going to section the fuselage and the wings to bring it closer to an actual Marauder scale, and indeed had cut 65mm out of the rear fuselage. I'd also cut openings for a twin linked heavy bolter platform from a Rhino/Predator tank and a hold for ammo crates. I'd mapped these conversions using plan from a kit and on paper it looked cool, the reality was horrifyingly shite🤷‍♂️🤣..... back to the drawing board. Shooting myself in the foot further, I realised that I'd used some of the ""waste"" section for my Arvus Lighter. I've fuddled it together using what I had left, and parts from another smaller Lancaster kit- overall the fuselage is now approximately 25mm shorter than the standard one.

After months of work, I just released a major update to Weather on the Way that I think makes checking weather while driving way more natural.

**What's new in 2.0:**

# 🎯 ""Go Now"" Mode

* Updates your route in real time and adjust to the current location. 
* If you leave your route (we all do sometimes), the app automatically recalculates weather conditions for your new path
* When enabled, Live Activities show up when switching to other apps. 

# 📱 Live Activities + Dynamic Island

* Weather conditions float right above your turn-by-turn directions in the Dynamic Island
* Works with ANY navigation app you prefer, be it Apple Maps, Google Maps, Waze, whatever. 
* See incoming weather alerts and how long they'll last without switching apps


Basically, instead of competing for attention with directions apps (dangerous during driving), it compliments them by adding the upcoming weather info right at the top of the screen.

I'm a big (6'4"") bloke who had been steadily putting on a bit of weight each year but just about managed to keep it deniable. Not least because I remained reasonably active. ""I'm quite fit, I can't be *that* fat"", I'd tell myself, even as the scale crept relentlessly upward.

I'd done a few diets (Fast 800 among them) but I'd hated them and put the weight back on almost as quickly as it had come off. The dreary food on Fast 800...

And then, one day, I heard about ADF because someone I knew had done it. She wasn't big to begin with and I hadn't seen her results but it caught me the right way and I just jumped in.

I'm a Monday Wednesday Friday chap and I eat over the weekend. I can't be working out the diary consequences of fasting different days each week and I absolutely positivey cannot be bothered with calorie counting. My fasting is strict but not doctrinaire, if you know what I mean. I would *plan* to be strict (black coffee, white tea, water and electrolyte) but, if I needed a banana to get me through the evening, or to eat a fish finger to encourage my five year old, I wouldn't freak out.

I've stuck to that regimen pretty well - with two exceptions, one for a family wedding and once last Friday for a friend's birthday. On each occasion, I ate the meal associated with the occasion but skipped breakfast and lunch and didn't snack.

Anyway, the first few weeks were a revelation. Mostly, the fasting days revealed just how much of my day was taken up thinking about, cooking, eating or clearing up food. I walked a fair bit, and I exercised a fair bit, I would get on a rower for 45mins, I'd get in the pool and swim 2-3km or I'd run. I found a new route and, by going slowly, I managed to run further than I ever had before. Over three weeks I worked up to a (VERY slow) half marathon. And then I did one each week. I even did one on a fasting day - although I do not recommend that *at all*. And, of course, the weight fell off.

For about eight weeks.

Having started at 114.6kg (252lbs) I got down to 105.6kg (232.3lb) over the course of eight weeks.

And then I plateaued. And I've been stuck at that plateau for a while now. But I had been weighing myself every day on my new fangled Withing body composition scale so I thought I'd share what that looked like and canvas the wisdom of the crowd.

So, the first chart up top is just weight. I have included a fair bit of data from before I started the diet. You can see where the diet starts though - not only from the shape of the trace but also because I added in a projected trendline from the start and which represents a weight loss of 1.5kg (3.3lbs/week) as you can see, I tracked that, fairly accurately for the first eight weeks before I parted company from it.

But there's no question that I *have* parted company from the trend. As of this morning I had lost just 7kg

So, when others have hit plateaus, one of the first things that people cite is fluctuations and, in particular, water weight.

But I can plot that too. Here is a chart of the change in the various components of body composition (fat, muscle, water), relative to the figures recorded on my start date.  The good news, is that weight loss and fat loss track each other very closely - almost all the loss has come from fat rather than muscle or water (at least according to Withings' algorithm). In fact, at my most recent weigh in, (this morning) my scale said I had lost slightly more fat (7.6kg) than total wight (7kg) and that I had, consequently gained muscle. I think that's a bit unlikely but it's certainly within the margin of error for the machine's sensor. (Look how changes in water and muscle track over the week - I ostensibly gain about a kilo of solid muscle every weekend when I have two non-fast days together)All in all, I'm generally pleased. I have lost weight. I look better, my clothes fit better and I don't think I'd have been able to run any sort of a half marathon at all at my old weight. So, in some sense, I'm doing well - even as my absolute rowing performance has fallen off.

But I admit to being pretty mystified by the plateau.

I'm not counting calories or denying myself on eating days but I'm probably eating better than I was before I started anyway. I snack less and rarely have as big a lunch as I might previously have done. I do still have the occasional snack in the evening on eating days but it's generally a couple of crispbread with some cheese rather than a leftover drumstick. What I'm saying is that the plateau isn't because I've started eating 4,500 caliories on my eating days.

My measurements haven't changed quite as much as I thought they might either. My waist probably started at 41"", it's now 38.5"". It's certainly an improvement and, as I said, I'm back into trousers I haven't worn in years, which is great. But I seem to have stalled there.

And, of course, there's the looming thought that this is a pretty tough regimen to achieve *maintenance*. I don't want to do this forever and I don't want to gain it all back again. when I stop

I've got a few theories about this.

One possibility is that I am over-fitting the line. The plateau isn't that that big. Maybe I lost more weight at the beginning as my shocked body dumped water and (ahem) *took a different view about the contents of my colon* but what is now happening is that I am acclimatising a bit. I therefore had the illusion of losing fat a bit faster than I actually was and my present weight is a fairer reflection of how I'm doing. That would be consistent with my calories in. My fasting means I'm proabably 7500calories  down on the week before exercise. Add in another 2,000 for the exercise and I might be at a total deficit of 9,500 calories, which isn't quite enough to deliver the 3.3lbs/week of of loss I was originally seeing - even before accounting for those stray bananas/fishfingers.

On that view, I should carry on as I am for a few weeks and it will come right in the end.

The other is that there is some sort of metabolic rebalancing going on and I need to do something to punch through, re-shock my metabolism and make more gains.

I’m from Europe, traveling soon with my wife, baby and myself. We’ll be bringing a suitcase on this trip, but I'm also looking to build up our travel bag inventory, starting with a reliable, versatile carry-on backpack. I want something I can use for both family and solo trips. What would be a good first step in my situation that I could take with me next week to Portugal?

Current Setup & Preferences:

* I already have a 22L Deuter (HP Stockholm) backpack and a diaper bag, but I want a main carry-on backpack for myself.
* I need space for a laptop, in case I want to travel and work from abroad in the future.
* I’d love something in a cream, sand, or brown color that balances functionality with a clean look.

Bags I’m considering currently:

* **CabinZero Classic, Plus, or Pro:** These models offer various features and capacities. I like the coffee brown look.
* **Forclaz Travel 500:** This backpack seems to offer good organization and durability.
* **Osprey Daylite Expandable (26+6L)**: It looks like a solid choice since it can be compressed to fit as a “personal item,” but I'm unsure if it’s suitable for longer trips.
* **Osprey Farpoint 40L**: Looks like a classic choice.

I don't have a packing list. I always take too many clothes with me and just starting to learn the way of onebag :)

Late January she suffered quite a bad episode of psychosis and went to a mental health ward for about 6 months, then moved to a nursing home for another 3ish months. About 8 weeks ago she came home and family has been trying to help her integrate back into life. 

While she wasn’t home her daughter’s boyfriend who my auntie doesn’t like was stopping there and making a mess, my auntie is very house proud and now she’s getting really upset with the mess, he’s got tools all over the house and the garden, they’ve damaged her bedside tables by moving stuff around, there’s wires everywhere and the garden is hugely overgrown. She’s got a massive coffee machine in the kitchen now when she doesn’t even drink coffee. She didn’t agree to him basically moving in while she was gone but he did. I tried to voice how my auntie wouldn’t like this but was shot down.

Now she’s home and my cousin is now keeping my auntie’s phone from her, my auntie can’t contact anyone so she’s understandably lonely. My cousin is also trying to stop my auntie from leaving the house. My auntie used to leave the house daily, it was good for her, she would go for long walks and go to her friend’s houses and out for lunch and when she first got home my cousin locked her in the house with the key on the outside. Then the carers came early(they come twice a day for 30 minutes each) and my cousin hadn’t had chance to unlock the door so they reported her to social workers for safeguarding. Quite rightly, we didn’t know she was doing this. What if there is an emergency? Well now my auntie isn’t being locked in but when she leaves the house my cousin is shouting at her. 

My auntie doesn’t have her glasses because they’re lost. So she needs new ones but my cousin won’t take her to get new ones but when we offer to take her my cousin shuts us down and says no. 
My auntie used to save her money but she saves it often in cash because she’s a bit old fashioned. Well a fair bit of that money has been taken. I think by my cousins boyfriend, he’s not worked since August. My auntie can’t find it. And my cousin has been keeping her bank card as well. She bought 2 new mattresses for family members to spend the night even though everyone works full time and my own cousin hasn’t wanted to spend the night. She paid for it withy auntie’s bank card and my auntie didn’t get a say in that. Honestly I don’t think she even knows.

My auntie now has become incontinent both bowels and bladder at night. My cousin didn’t sort her a mattress protector out and only now has sorted that. But then I assume my auntie has been sleeping in a wet bed if a mattress protector has only just been bought.

Now my cousin is keeping a lot of stuff quite close to her chest and we don’t know what’s happening. But yesterday we were informed that our auntie has had to go back into the mental health ward. We haven’t really got an idea why because my cousin won’t tell us but while my auntie is in I’m tempted to ring and inform them of some of this as I assume some of this is related. My auntie was doing quite good at home but her daughter was letting her down. My cousin is desperate and therefore doesn’t want her boyfriend to leave her. He’s an arsehole if I’m honest but that’s besides the point, my auntie is vulnerable and while other family members say to leave it I think I should report it as I think she’s being let down, neglected in some ways, abused financially and I know she gets shouted at sometimes as if she’s a naughty child and she’s also being taken advantage of. A lot of this has only really come to light since my auntie has been home because we were unaware of a lot of it while she wasn’t home as when we would go to see her we wasn’t seeing her AT home so we couldn’t see the mess and that someone she didn’t like was living there.

I've tried speaking to classmates (They never listened to me), teachers and school counsellors. But none of them made me feel better in the end, only temporarily.

On top of all that, a loved one died recently, and it made me feel heartbroken even though I didn't know him that well. The only thing I have to remember him by is his watch.
When we were cleaning out the house, his watch was sitting on the coffee table, where he would always sit. 

In Preschool and Kindergarden, I was never able to have a conversation with anyone. I was too shy. So, all I did was sit in silence, without a friend. I felt alone, and scared. Even during recess and lunch, I would just sit alone, and think about how everyone else has a friend except me. I did eventually end up making friends in Year 2 and 3, but that trauma never healed properly. I still reflect on it today.

Long-time Bama fan here. Just wanted to share my experience with the FANMATS Alabama Crimson Tide Ulti-Mat Rug I got for my man cave. After having it for a couple months, I can honestly say it was worth every penny.

First off, the size is perfect (5x8). I was worried it might be too big for my space, but it fits just right under my coffee table and TV setup. The Alabama rug really ties the whole room together - and I mean that literally and figuratively lol.

Some things I really love:

* The colors are spot on. Not that cheap-looking red you sometimes get with fan gear. This is proper Crimson Tide crimson.
* It doesn't slide around at all (has this non-slip backing that actually works)
* Build quality is solid. Been walking on it daily and it still looks new
* You can actually machine wash it (tested this after a salsa incident during the Auburn game...)

A few small things to note:

* It took about a day to lay completely flat after unrolling
* It's lighter than I expected (12 pounds), which is actually great for cleaning
* The nylon material feels really nice underfoot, not scratchy at all

Price-wise, I got it for $117 (down from $190), which I thought was pretty decent for a licensed product that's made in the USA. Honestly wasn't expecting US-made quality at this price point.",1,1731322829.0,RandomAmazonReviews,0,1.0,False

Most today would be considered Very Poor. Companies just seem to not care anymore. Well, Waterdrop is different. I feel so good about my purchase and their service, that I feel compelled to write this review with hopes that you will all try their products and services and have the same awesome experience I've had with them.

First, I bought the [Waterdrop G3 Reverse Osmosis System](https://amazon-movers-and-shakers.findgoodlist.com/dp-B07P1XFYJP) to install in my daughter's house while she was on her honeymoon. I did everything by the book but couldn't get it to work. This was a Sunday afternoon. I called the Tech Support number, and a human answered!

Then, he walked me through everything and said it appears to be a bad power cord. He rushed me a new cord. I returned to my daughter's house and connected the new cord. It still didn't work, even though other appliances worked on the receptacle. I contacted Waterdrop again and explained everything. They RUSH shipped me a new unit. I installed it and it still didn't work. This concerned me as I find it hard to believe they would ship 2 faulty units. I moved the RO to another location, and it WORKED! I then shut off the power, removed the receptacle and found a wire that was not secure.

Coincidentally, it had contact when I plugged in another appliance, but then not when I plugged in the RO. I corrected the wiring issue, and the RO worked great. This company jumped through hoops to make me a happy customer and I appreciate it very much. I will be recommending them to my friends and using them anytime I need an RO.

Sometimes instead, nothing comes out and then an aggressive sputtering starts to exist and my coffee goes outside the pot with so much force becuase the water is already boiling. I need to close the fire, let it chill then open again many times.

I have 2 idea:

1. the amount of coffee. If i put too much coffee, there is no room for water to normally pass and it will pass only when the water is boiling for the amount of pressure
2. the moka isnt screw properly and there is a leakage of pressure. so the amount of pressure enough to make the water goes up, is when it's boiling

The past few months have been brutal, to say the least! Been working on building my startup as a solo-founder day-night, all while doing consultancy to keep up with the budget, and managing work-life balance, if there is any later left. Many solo founders are discouraged for not having a co-founder, for reasons that are certainly valid, but this does not necessaraly it's not possible. We already have a solid customer base (pre-launch), and most importantly a working product already providing real value to data teams.

After months of grinding (and probably too much coffee ☕), I'm excited to finally launch Sulie publicly! For those interested in ML/time series forecasting, I'd love your feedback.

other important information: he invited me to go to a coffee shop to study for the exam we have coming up. he messages me to check up on me quite a lot (i have a chronic condition and miss school every so often), he sent me like his entire notes for the class we share after i missed a couple lessons, he compliments me and likes all my stories on instagram

By saying ""to know cheeses"", I mean like knowing how they're made and how the preparation broadly affects the outcome, especially in taste; for example, talking about something I know a bit more, I recently started understanding a bit more about coffee and started to understand how roasting level, grind setting, brewing temperature and so on affect the final coffee and thus to formulate my view on how to prepare it and when to (sort of).  
So, for example, I'd like to understand how to pair cheese with a meal, which kinds of cheeses are better to fondue and so on, but also a bit in what makes them more akin to a certain kind of preparation.

My gf has been trying her hand at candlemaking recently and I really want to encourage this hobby for her, so I was thinking of buying her a dedicated wax melter. To date she's been using old coffee jars to melt wax in pans of water, and whilst it's been working, I think a proper wax melter will make the process a lot easier. 

I don't have a clue where to start though, this isn't something I know much about, and a lot of the wax melters I see on amazon look a bit gimmicky.

Could anyone please recommend a good wax melter I could get her started with? Doesn't need to be anything top of the line, just something easy to use, reliable, and ideally easy to clean. Preferably something small-ish too, seeing as she's just getting started and only making them for friends and family so far.

——————————

Setting:

Time: Modern-day, in a bustling city that never sleeps. Think New York or a fictional equivalent. Skyscrapers, alleys, coffee shops, and everything in between—it's a place where the mundane meets the supernatural just beneath the surface.

Place: The story primarily revolves around a run-down but charming office space the two main characters rent for their private investigation work. The office is located in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood, with flickering neon signs outside and a few too many shadows lurking around corners. The building itself has a distinct old-world charm that stands out amidst the more modern architecture.


Main Characters:

1. The Male Vampire (My Character):

Age: Turned in the mid-1500s, making him roughly 500 years old.

Personality: Stoic, calculating, and perhaps a bit cynical. His long life has made him somewhat desensitized to human suffering, and he holds a general disdain for mortals. However, there are glimpses of a deeper, more complex side—a part of him that yearns for connection, perhaps even redemption. His violent nature is a byproduct of centuries of survival in a ruthless world.

Backstory: Originally from Europe, he was turned during a time of great turmoil and has spent centuries adapting to the ever-changing human world. He harbors a violent past filled with bloodshed and power struggles, and only recently has he chosen a quieter life—at least on the surface.

Skills: Exceptional combat skills, both with guns and melee weapons. Has knowledge of ancient magic and occult practices, which he rarely uses. Keen detective skills, honed by centuries of reading people and situations.



2. The Apprentice:

Age: Recently turned, appears to be in her late 20s or early 30s.

Personality: Fierce and independent, but with a deep vulnerability stemming from the traumatic events that led to her turning. She has a strong sense of justice and a rebellious streak, clashing at times with her mentor’s colder, more pragmatic approach. She's still adjusting to her new life as a vampire and grappling with her loss of humanity.

Backstory: Was attacked by a rogue vampire during an investigation of her own (perhaps she was a detective or a journalist). The main vampire saved her life but at the cost of turning her, binding her to this new, immortal existence. Now, she serves as his apprentice, learning the ropes of both her new powers and the darker side of the world.

Skills: Skilled investigator and excellent at reading people. Quick on her feet and has a knack for using modern technology (smartphones, computers) to gather information. Still learning combat and vampiric abilities.




Supporting Characters:

1. The Landlord:

Age: Early to mid-30s.

Personality: Sharp, shrewd, and business-minded. She’s observant and has likely noticed something ""off"" about her tenants but hasn’t confronted them directly about it. She often shows up at inconvenient times, either demanding rent or just making her presence known. Despite her exterior, she has a softer side that comes out when she’s off-duty, lounging in her pajamas with a glass of wine and a reality TV show on.

Role: Provides comic relief and a sense of normalcy amidst the supernatural chaos. She may also end up getting involved in a case or two, either unknowingly or as a valuable informant.




Themes:

Action: There will be moments of intense, bloody combat, whether it's dealing with rogue vampires, hunting down demons, or surviving encounters with ancient beings. The main characters will often find themselves in shootouts, chases, and hand-to-hand combat scenarios.

Comedy: Light-hearted banter between the mentor and apprentice is key. The landlord’s unexpected appearances and her homey, disheveled side add moments of levity. The contrast between their ancient, supernatural lives and mundane modern-day problems (like paying rent or dealing with phone scams) can lead to humorous situations.

Drama: Delving into the complexities of the mentor-apprentice relationship, exploring the apprentice’s struggle with her new identity, and the male vampire's own buried emotions. This also includes the darker aspects of their pasts and how it affects their present.

Romance (Optional): The relationship between the two main characters can develop organically, starting as a reluctant partnership before moving into friendship, and perhaps even a deeper connection. The slow burn would explore themes of trust, vulnerability, and the push-pull dynamic between two strong-willed individuals.


Plot Hooks:

Case Files: Each ""episode"" of the RP could revolve around a new case, ranging from missing persons with a supernatural twist to haunted artifacts or cultist demonic summonings.

The Rogue Vampire: The vampire who attacked the apprentice is still out there, posing a threat and possibly connected to a larger, sinister plot.

Conflict with Other Supernaturals: Werewolves, witches, and ancient vampire clans could come into play, either as allies, clients, or enemies.

Revealing the Past: Flashbacks or discussions revealing more about the main vampire's long history and why he chose to save his apprentice, creating opportunities for character development.

Or there was several times where my parents would stress about how he goes to the coffee shop everyday because it’s his way of socializing and that he was spending a lot of money.
Or one time my dad said that when he was his age he had already a motorcycle and he doesn’t have anything yet.
I would be so frustrated,sad and pressed about their comments that I would take that into the relationship and would start to analyze everything that my parents said and start being very negative towards my partner.
I think that I wanted him to be accepted by my parents that I started to bother about things that I didn’t even had noticed or that didn’t bother me until they started mention it.

Here are some of the things that keep me busy:
* Outdoor activities (hiking, exploring nature)
* Reading
* Trying out new food spots and cafes
* Board games
* Music 
* Series and kdrama
* Also a BTS fan


I’m hoping to meet like-minded people who are up for:
* Sharing stories and laughs over coffee or drinks

The first day is showing the ropes but once the new hire has the ropes held, it’s only a matter of time before they start testing the pull.

**Notes:** 

**Dour** as in **Dior** as in **Dee-your**

You can change the name **Elijah**

Safe to say that at any given moment except for when a door is closed, office noises can be heard (typing, bg talking, walking, over the phone talking etc)

\_\_\_\_\_

\[door opens\]

\[sighs\] You sure took your time getting here…

The weather isn’t an excuse, you should be prepared for anything, especially on your first day and *especially* if you want this position.

I understand what he said but listen to what I’m saying now: don’t be late again.

\[speaker stands and clears throat\]

Follow me. I hope those shoes are walkable because you won’t be sitting for the next hour.

\[walking and talk\]

Dour Senior says you have experience in customer service and marketing but being a secretary is the ability to be everything all at once with little error. A writer, timer, marketer, plan organizer, coffee runner, manager, so on and so forth.

Of course, I can’t expect you get it immediately but each area has a limit. Very three strikes, and you’re out, the strike depends on the area.

No, baseball means nothing to me. Simply a point of reference.

When my father described you he said you were open minded, energetic, and \[shudders\] “obviously the life of the party,” and looking at you now \[pause in walking to look at the listener\] I see that’s true \[continue walk\]

What you’re wearing is fine for today but going forward remember when I’m around, I'm the point of focus. No one cares who you are, just your title and what that is in reference to me. A personality hire will do me no good, no matter what my father says.nSpeaking of which, don’t mention my father, on your own accord. Avoid it as much as possible.

Yes, I tend to be blunt. Do not expect an apology.

\[stop walking, elevator button press (do they all make clicky noises? Im unsure now)\] 

You’ve already seen my office and the desk right outside of it, that’s where you work.

Whenever you are away from it, you must notify me.

I’m sure my father has already walked you through the building but we’re going to visit the places we will usually be seen together. Well we will after we pick up somethings.

\[elevator arrives, step inside\] We’re heading down to the IT and Technical Care department to pick up your company issued phone, tablet and laptop. For whatever reason that they couldn’t manage to get it to my office in time for your arrival despite being labeled as priority.

It was labeled as such Monday.

Yes, yesterday. Why the questioning?

\[sigh\] Right. Server issues, requests were pushed. 

How infuriating. I suppose that means there’s no discussion to be had then.

\[elevator stops with a ding\]

\[walking through, uh server noises maybe?\]

Mhm. There usually is a chill to prevent overheating. The outside climate has been unforgiving. One moment- \[a bit louder\] Derek, do you mind grabbing my things?

\[to the listener\] You should learn the names of your peers sooner rather than later. I don’t have time to explain who does what and where. I expect progress by the end of today.

Yes, I mean you will be tested.

…Thank you, Derek. Derek, this is my secretary, I’m sure you’ve heard of them being uniquely referred to as “the hire.” I trust you’ll give them just as hard of a time as anyone.

Good to hear, I’ll see you at the end of the week.

\[elevator sequence\]

Yes, very ominous.

You'll likely get various names that aren’t yours until you either jump in respect or receive one that sticks.

Nope, not a requirement. Simply, office culture. \[Elevator ding!\]

Speaking of office culture, don’t come back here unless you absolutely have to. The tech team deal with enough already and aren’t going to sugar coat anything stupid you do.

Yes, neither will I, but coworker interactions will be noticeably different from boss-worker interactions.

Enough of that. I suggest you multitask and set up your devices as we move. Write anything I tell you to and set a timer for 30 minutes. We have to visit the garage and receive your parking sticker and ID, again. Something that should’ve been ready before your arrival but work ethic had been disappointing as of late.

Yes, the tech team was excused but you’ll soon to come and find what I mean.

\*\*\*

\[Speaker and listener are back in the Speaker’s office. Door closes.\]

Okay. Exactly an hour. I really should be going back to work and you need to link the desktop to your devices.

Yes, very many, but it’s only for your position in an attempt to keep things efficient. Not every moment is a laptop or phone moment.

Any further questions?

You lunch is In two and a half hours, it’s 30 mins.

No, mines in an hour and I expect my order ready then. You wrote down what I told you right?

\[sigh\] do you at least remember? Recite it back to me.

…

Good. I expect that in an hour and for you to either remember that for every Tuesday, or write it down now. My diet isn’t to be ignored. If you last here I expect you to learn the specifics and be able to order something new upon request.

“If you last” as in if you can handle this job. Which I’m rooting for considering how much of my time you’ve wasted.

Set up your devices. Grab my lunch. Get to work.

Check my emails, calendar for the week etc.

Now go.

\*\*\*

\[office phone ringing before being picked up with a click\]

Elijah Dour.

\[clears throat\] Afternoon father.

Yes, all is well.

No. I didn’t make an attempt to scare them away, they’re doing… fine.

I still don't see why this is necessary though. I was doing just fine on my own.

Yes, I understand Mother’s concern but she seems to have ulterior motives that aren’t work related.

\[sigh\] And It’s beginning to sound like she’s convinced you. Can you two please tell her I’m doing fine, and to bother my brothers about their relationships.

Right. Of course…

The Hire is fine. I still have no strong opinions on them. They don’t seem to falter under conversations with new people, that was clear. And they seem able to connect things rather quickly.

When talking with José and Joyce they were able to immediately put together that they were married, despite them managing to hide it from basically the entire office.

Despite the demonstration, Im usually not opposed to writing it off as a fluke.

But after being able to recite a couple other workers, their positions, and assumed trait of theirs with no issue, I have to admit they may be more socially aware than I originally expected.

No. No negative commentary, they kept it rather neutral.

Mind you, that I had made sure they were multitasking throughout.

\[sigh\] Yes, I am saying I was…impressed.

Ugh. Your amusement is frustrating.

\[knocking\]

\[quietly\] Good right on time.

I have to take my break now, goodbye father. \[click\]

\[door opens\] I assume you have my lunch.

\[steps approach\] Thank you.

What?

You’re free to do whatever you want with your desk as long as it doesn’t interfere with your work and isn’t absurdly obnoxious.

Eh..I’m gonna ask you to refrain from doing anything too special with any of your devices backgrounds. A colour change would be fine.

Mh. Okay.

You took some liberties to do what?

\[quietly\] Colour code my… \[mouse clicking\] Ohh. Hm. I suppose it is easier to read, and I see you kept in the realm of company colours.

Yes, I approve of it. Are there any other liberties I should know of?

Yes, I noticed your organization of my email. We’ll see how it does.

Is that all?

Okay. Actually while I have you, you seem capable enough to handle this right?

It’s a pile of contracts with various businesses we have at the moment,. As you can tell, they’re organized alphabetically, which is less than helpful, I need you to handle this before the day is over.

Are you…pouting?

I guess digitizing them would be helpful. Great so you can do that and organize their physical versions by the end of the day.

Is that not what you wanted? Hm. That’s too bad.

I suggest making a dent in it before your own lunch or you’ll have to work through it. Understood?

…*Understood*?

Good. You’re dismissed.",2,1731321207.0,ASMRScriptHaven,0,1.0,False

🏕 SOLO HOBO: WHAT A JOURNEY & IT CONTINUES 🚂

HOW IT STARTED: Left from Jacksonville, FL (October 10, 2021) towards Las Vegas, NV where I planned to settle & restart my life as a Licensed Electrician, but detoured here to do some urban exploring (Urbex). My car broke (water sucked via the air intake into the engine) & this was the day it got towed away for scrap. I went from roadtripping to the streets. Slept in a parking garage nearby till I got arrested for trespassing & driven by the police to be dumped off at homeless shelter in inner city Detroit. Spent one night there, but decided it was better to brave the elements. Relocated to sleeping behind a pile of storage like extra chairs, tables, etc. in the parking garage of Motor City Casino. My bed was a piece of plywood & my pillow was the headrest of a computer chair. Wore all my clothing since the weather was below freezing. I’d spend my days inside the casino drinking their free coffee & soda while watching sports. Actually applied to work there, but never got a response. My food came from homeless organizations & dumpster diving. The few possessions I had were stolen. Got COVID when the weather got into the teens with snow plus ice & was taken by an ambulance to the hospital since could barely walk. Spent 16 hours in the waiting room before getting a bed to relax in for a bit, but got released into the bitter cold the next day. Relocated to sleeping in the mechanical room on top of an abandoned hospital. Eventually, after two months in extreme weather, my buddy (Abe) convinced me to leave (was so intent on getting enough money to film abandoned buildings that I wasn't thinking rationally) & bought me a plane ticket to Vegas. For a multitude of reasons I never got around to reintroducing myself to society & decided that I'd turn this into a journey of self-discovery, treatment, therapy, etc. The blessing turned out to be unbelievable.

At first, Turtle Man was super nice to me. He made a few sexual remarks which I was pretty good at ignoring by that point. Whatever. He's still a nice guy. I fall asleep in the back a few times and he says ""it's ok, I'd be asleep too."" My boss has told us it's ok to nap as long as no one catches us. 

By no one I thought that meant corporate. I figured other employees would have the decency to keep their mouths shut so long as a. I'm getting my work done and b. My actions aren't impacting them in any way. 

While I used to sleep every night, I've cut back greatly to about once a month, if that. I only nap if I absolutely cannot keep my eyes open. Am I trying to justify my sleeping on the clock? No. 

What I am trying to justify is minding your own damn business. All my boss said was ""don't get caught,"" so I figured my ass was covered. Even on the rare occasions I do fall asleep nowadays, he will text my boss at 4:30 in the morning to let her know. I was furious the first few times he snitched considering he told me it doesn't bother him. 

Another time he snitched because my boyfriend came into the lobby to bring me some food from his work. Last night, he snitched on me because the coffee wasn't finished. Our boss has assigned night audit with brewing coffee for Turtle Man before he comes in ""to help out."" I would have no problem with this if Turtle Man came in when he was supposed to. 

He is listed on the schedule to come in at 5 am. Alright, fair enough, I should have until 5 am to finish my coffee. WRONG. He comes in at 4 am everyday. This makes him two hours early on the weekends when he is scheduled to come in at 6. Weekends are busy, so I started brewing the coffee at 3:15 am instead of 3 am. 

Turtle man decided to arrive at 3:50 am that day. I personally am not comfortable being alone in the kitchen with him, so I assume he could finish up. He was here two hours early, after all. What did he think he got to do? Twiddle his thumbs? Stay home if you want to do that. 

At 3:50 am, the coffee was done except for the hot water, which needed filled the rest of the way. All he had to do was press a button, wait for it to finish filling, and put it out. It would have taken all of 5 minutes and barely any physical effort. Instead of doing that, he texts my boss around 4 am that I didn't finish the coffee. She texts me shortly after. 

""You have to finish the coffee if you start it,"" she said. No no no. I wasn't having this today. ""He got here 10 minutes early, and all he had to do was finish filling the hot water."" Angry, I add ""I'm not sure why he wound snitch about such a small task."" She asks if I finished the coffee, I confirmed with her that I did in fact do everything except half of the hot water. 


Expecting a lecture, I'm suprised when my boss's response reads ""yeah, he's just like that. I also told him to come in at 5 on weekends so you have more time.""

It felt good knowing my boss was on my side, and now The Turtle Man would have to change his entire routine because of me. It's 4:30 am on a Monday and he's still not here. Thank God. ",2,1731320805.0,hatemyjob,4,0.75,False

Let's face it: traveling is stressful. Airports are crowded, your flight's delayed (again!), and don't even get us started on airplane snacks. But what if we told you there's a way to make your travels feel as glamorous as a red carpet moment, all without shelling out for first-class seats? It's time you learn about the **Vintage Crunch Leather Suit Cover** from [Fabrica Kraft](https://www.fabricakraft.com/)**,** your new best friend for jet-setting in style!

**Are You Really Traveling If Your Suit Isn't as Stylish as You?**

We've all been there. You arrive at your destination, pull out your carefully curated outfit for that big event (whether a business meeting or wedding), and —GASP—it's wrinkled beyond recognition! Instead of channeling that sleek, sophisticated look, you resemble someone who just woke up from a long nap. Not ideal. But with the [Vintage Crunch Leather Suit Cover](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/vintage-crunch-leather-suit-cover), your suits (and your pride) are kept intact, no matter how many flights, train rides, or road trips you endure. Its Premium tan and beige luxury suit cover with adjustable strap literally goes hand in hand with the overhead airplane compartment ( one less thing to worry about). 

Now let's ask the real question: Do you deserve to walk around with a suit wrinkled like last year's trends? No, darling, you do not.

**Leather, Darling, Leather—Because Plastic is So Yesterday**

This isn't just a suit cover; it's a statement. Think of the luxurious, rugged texture of the vintage leather—so classy, it practically whispers, ""I only drink coffee flown in from Ethiopia"" as you sashay through the terminal. And let's be real: plastic covers are so last decade. If we're taking eco-consciousness seriously, why not do it in style? (Yes, we're looking at you, fast fashion!) 

And who knows? With this 3.5 lbs timeless piece slung over your shoulder, you might just be mistaken for a celebrity ducking the paparazzi—just say ""no comment"" and keep walking. (Bonus points if you're wearing oversized sunglasses.)

Let's Get Real!

Quick question: When was the last time your travel accessories actually sparked joy?

A) Yesterday! I live in blissful, organized harmony.

B) I've had the same suitcase since college, so...

C) You mean I'm supposed to like my travel gear?

If you answered B or C, my friend, it's time for an upgrade. The **Vintage Crunch Leather Suit** Cover carved out of chrome-tanned genuine leather and brass rivets offers more than just a chic look. It's functional, with enough room to store your finest attire, ties, belts, cufflinks, and internal compartments for those emergency fashion fixes (We see you, safety pins!). Now, all you need to do is organize everything in one place, sit, and enjoy the beauty of this masterpiece like an onlooker. 

**Feel Like Adam Lavine From 'Makes Me Wonder**

In today's world, where travel influencers and celebrities flaunt their jet-setting lifestyles, why shouldn't you feel just as fabulous? With this suit cover, you'll exude luxury wherever you go—even if it's just for that weekend getaway you booked on a budget airline. Pair the **Vintage Crunch Leather Suit Cover** with a sleek formal outfit, and you might even find yourself ushered into the first-class lounge by mistake. (Hey, it could happen!)

Did you know luxury travel is making a comeback post-pandemic? After 2 years of sweats and Zoom calls, people are splurging on experiences that make them feel, well, alive again. And nothing says ""I'm back, baby!"" like stepping off a plane with your sharpest suit, safely stowed in the Vintage Crunch Leather Suit Cover. 

**So, Are You Ready to Be the Star of Your Own  Show**?

Whether you're a business mogul, a wedding guest, or simply a fashionista who demands that their wardrobe travel in style, this leather suit cover will transform your trips from meh to marvelous (wrinkles and creases stay a mile away!) Because, darling, travel isn't just about the destination—it's about arriving like you own the runway.

Now go ahead, channel your inner VIP, and make your next trip feel like a scene from a Bond film (minus the high-speed chases). [Vintage Crunch Leather Suit Cover](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/vintage-crunch-leather-suit-cover), available now, and as timeless as your taste.

Stay fabulous, stylish travellers because why should celebs have all the fun?
