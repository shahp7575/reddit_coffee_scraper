1jnwpt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwentiesIndia/comments/1jnwpt8/how_to_recognize_romance_fiction_in_the_wild_a/,How to Recognize Romance Fiction in the Wild - A Field Guide for the Hopeless Romantic yet Skeptical Reader,"Are people skilled writers? Yes. Are they honest? Nah, not always. Especially not on reddit. The internet is full of talented storytellers who can craft engaging and feel-good narratives, but not every tale you read is rooted in reality. Some stories are written for entertainment/practice, others for attention, and a few simply to rack up likes and karma. While there's nothing wrong with enjoying a good piece of fiction, it's worth sharpening your instincts to spot when a story might be more imagination than experience. After all, not every “real-life romance” is as spontaneous (or believable) as it seems.

Romance narratives have universal appeal—they let us escape into worlds where serendipity overrides bureaucracy and chemistry defies social hierarchies. Heck, I love a good romance story. But spotting fictionalized stories requires an understanding of narrative conventions. With this guide, I hope to equip the readers (that's you!) to distinguish between genuine interactions versus artfully crafted karma farms.

# The Anatomy of Romance Tropes

**Trope 1: Romancing an Authority Figure**

Modern romance often uses power imbalances for tension. Consider the *enemies-to-lovers* archetype, where dislike transforms into desire. A classic example we all may have seen: sparring with a police officer during a traffic stop, only to have them drop professional boundaries faster than a speeding ticket.

In reality, Indian cops face strict conduct rules prohibiting personal relationships formed during duty. Yet fiction loves the fantasy of a high-ranking official (DySP, CEO, or grumpy librarian) abandoning protocol because the protagonist’s frown is “too cute.”

**Trope 2: Grand Gesture Gambits**

Real conflicts rarely resolve via samosa diplomacy. But in romance fiction, grand gestures—returning with snacks for an entire checkpoint, serenading someone with a ukulele at midnight—signal emotional growth. These moments prioritize cinematic flair over plausibility, which follows the *forced proximity* and *fake relationship* tropes.

If someone was to gift food to officials, it could raise eyebrows under anti-corruption laws. Fiction stories, however, frame it as the “winning over the grumpy guy with yummy treats” trope, something that has been perfected by Hallmark movies (and 13 year old girls on Wattpad).

# Dialogue Giveaways: When Banter Feels Scripted

**Unnatural Code-Switching**

Authentic Hindi-English dialogue flows organically: *“Arrey, AC office se thak gaye?”* not *“I just finished my 9-to-6 work hours.”* Scripted exchanges tend to over-translate, resulting in clunky/cheesy/cinematic phrases like *“Chhoti-chhoti baaton pe itna pareshaan kyun hote ho?”* instead of colloquial *“Itni choti baat pe gussa?”*

Romance fiction excels at witty repartee, but real-life conversations include awkward pauses, topic jumps, and at least one person mishearing “chaat” as “chat.”

**The Instant Chemistry Mirage**

In fiction, a single shared glance can ignite lifelong passion. Reality? Dating apps prove most first encounters involve debating whether to split the bill or ghost after an emoji misunderstanding.

The *love triangle* and *friends-to-lovers* tropes rely on accelerated timelines—48-hour courtships, confessions during monsoons—while actual relationships often simmer for days (or months) before someone risks a handhold.

**Overly detailed dialogue mimicking screenplay writing**

The over-the-top description of clothes, settings, and other details. Real people don’t narrate their outfits like a fashion blogger mid-date. If they mention clothes, it’s usually 'I wore that blue kurta with the coffee stain. But in fiction, these details are dialed up to create vivid imagery—like a “white zardozi suit” that’s “absolutely breathtaking” or a perfectly timed sunflower bouquet. 

While these flourishes make the story more cinematic, they often feel out of place in genuine anecdotes, where people focus more on emotions and actions than on catalog-level descriptions of outfits and accessories. If you find yourself picturing the scene like a movie set, chances are it’s been written with that intention.

# Structural Giveaways

**Conflict-Resolution 'Whiplash'**

Genuine workplace disputes often involve HR meetings, not flirtatious reprimands. Yet romance plots compress timelines:

1. **Inciting Incident**: Traffic stop at 6 PM
2. **Gestation Period**: 3 hours (enough for guilt samosas)
3. **Climax**: Date invitation via WhatsApp by 9 PM

This '*temporal compression'* mirrors the “meet cute” convention, where protagonists bypass small talk and launch into soul-baring conversation.

**Professionally Inappropriate Epilogues**

A DySP sharing her personal number? A CEO dating an intern? Such scenarios ignore real-world consequences. Fiction handwaves these as “love conquers hierarchy,” while actual workplaces have anti-fraternization policies in place.

# Forensic Reading Strategies

**The Trope Checklist**

Cross-reference stories against common romance motifs:

|Trope|Fictional Hallmark|Real-World Equivalent|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Authority Romance**|“Let’s debate ethics over chai!”|“Let’s file a grievance report.”|
|**Grand Gesture**|20 samosas as an apology|“I Gpay'd you for the Uber.”|
|**Insta-Love**|“You’re my soulmate” (Hour 2)|“You’re my… uh, what’s your name?”|

**The Emotional Payoff Audit**

**Ask**: Does every conflict resolve neatly? Are antagonists reformed via a heartfelt speech? Real life leaves loose threads; romance fiction ties them into bows.

# Conclusion: Enjoy the Fantasy, Respect the Craft

Romance fiction isn’t “unrealistic”—it’s aspirational. Recognizing its patterns allows us to appreciate the genre’s artistry without mistaking samosa diplomacy for relationship advice. Next time you encounter a suspiciously smooth courtship, channel your inner literary critic:

1. **Spot the tropes**
2. **Savor the dialogue** (but fact-check procedural details)
3. **Suspend disbelief**—judge stories by their entertainment value, not their HR compliance. I*f it seems too cinematic to be true, it probably is*.

After all, as the Bard wrote, *“The course of true love never did run smooth""* —unless it’s on Reddit, where it’s polished to a viral sheen.

Acting all annoyed that Whitley wants him to be involved in the wedding preparations for THEIR wedding (the horror!). Lying to Whitley about having to help the neighbors move in to get out of helping prepare for the engagement party. Making little disparaging comments; like when Whitley says he doesn't care about the engagement party and he goes ""Do you wake up whining, Whitley?"" And when Colonel Taylor asks him if everything's alright he says ""Just a case of the Whitleys."" Like dude! Your fiance is clearly stressed out and you're not helping!

Side note, but I liked Ron in this episode. Rewatching the show has made me realize that he's actually the voice of reason more often than I remember. It was subtle but when Dwayne is telling him about the new woman he likes, Ron keeps reminding him that he's lucky to have Whitley (even if in the usual crude Ron way lol). And he doesn't let Dwayne pretend that this isn't cheating.

And commit these alibis to memory.... Take my discount card to the come-as-you-are motel.""

We met up for coffee yesterday and it went ok. 5ish hours of catching up and chatting with only a few awkward silences. 

We talked a bit about past relationships and things we've tried to 'get out there'. I mentioned I signed up for singles event this weekend and suggested he come as it might be good for a laugh and worst case we have each other to talk to. He said he'd think about it. We parted ways saying lets do this again sometime. 

He text me tonight to ask me on a 'real' dinner date....for the night of my singles event lol. I'm going to eat the loss on that ticket and go for dinner to explore this a bit. Its obvious we are more mature people now, though there are still some differences and i'm just going to enjoy this for what it is because we always got along, there was no animosity. But I'll let ya'll know how this works out!!

(Editing to add: lighten up. I am choosing not to go to that event and he offered to go out another night if I'd rather. Which I don't. I enjoy Fridays to unwind after work week and Sundays aren't late nights. Saturday makes sense. He's not manipulating or controlling anything here and he may not even realize I paid to go already - its irrelevant.)

1jnw1iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jnw1iz/recent_breakup/,Recent breakup,"Hello! So sorry for the long post. I recently had a breakup with someone that had truly treated me well for once (all of my previous relationships were toxic and abusive, but I have gone through extensive therapy to heal and better myself). The breakup was the day after our 6 month anniversary and they had acted completely normal until hours before (going as far as to tell me they loved me that very morning). I was completely caught off guard by it and thought things were going well. They had the decency to break up in person, however they gave me zero explanation as to why until hours later over text. Here is what they texted;

""i’ve been uneasy about it for a bit and i finally decided this morning after talking through it with some others since i felt it was just me and mental health, but it’s a little more than that.
i did enjoy spending time with you and our relationship but on top of everything i have, having a partner right now feels almost overwhelming and just some other little things i thought id get over by six months i hadn’t (but i don’t want to just point out things), plus when we got together i thought we didn’t think we’d last all the way through grad school but we both were having a good time together, but now i think it’s best to end it here""

He have not talked since. Despite the brief explanation, I still feel confused and don't have the closure I need to move on. I had noticed they had been a little distant for the last month, but I figured it was because they were struggling mentally. I had suggested they seek therapy, to which they were incredibly receptive and were about to start days after breaking up. I see now that while I took the effort to communicate my feelings with them, they did not reciprocate.

Anyways, would it be reasonable to reach out to them and ask if we could go out to coffee or something to talk and tie up loose ends? I truly cherish the time we spent together and don't want us to part on a sour note. Sorry again for the long post, thank you for reading it through.",2,1743398802.0,BreakUps,9,1.0,False

I was gutted but I wished him all the best and went no contact. 

We went no contact for a month, then I suddenly got a message from him saying I was on his mind a lot and would I like to catch up. I agreed to get coffee in future.

The two main goals I tried to set for myself were to not read my books and stay off tiktok, because that app really sucks up a major amount of my time. And I did manage to succeed at both of those things the entire week. 

And the first part of the week was generally a success for me. I am unemployed at the moment which gives me a lot more time to dedicate to the Artist's Way, and I have projects to work on that can take up a lot of time. But being home without those distractions was very brutal. 

At first, it really reminded me of being a kid and having much more time to myself and to my thoughts, because there was much less distraction. I did some reorganizing, I did some baking that I had been wanting to do.  I was finding myself doodling more and just having fun with it. 

But I eventually hit some walls with my personal creative project,  and gave in and started looking at my phone. I told myself it was fine because I was still following the plan I promised myself, but I was definitely reading, and definitely on reddit. 

And on top of that, the biggest irony was for my artist date I went to a *new bookstore* that is in town. (And also ordered a coffee drink I didn't realize had a lot of sugar in it, after three weeks into a sugar purge.) 

By the end of the week I was feeling drained and low-energy. But then at night would slip into my old bad habit of staying up late anxiously plotting projects because I didn't feel like I was productive enough during the day. 

I still believe I learned some valuable things this week. Seeing the ways I waste my time, or some of the ways in which my own artistic tantrums manifest, especially when I'm facing a block with my own projects.

But I really feel like I cheated and didn't do it properly.  I don't know. There were some other things too, like I held off on writing my artist's prayer until the end of the week, and this week I did the least amount of artist's tasks because they didn't resonate with me as much. 

I'm thinking about doing the week over again, but then again, I am trying to learn to be less of a perfectionist and settle for doing things less than perfectly. ",2,1743398570.0,artistsWay,1,1.0,False

I am so in love with this man, and I truly believe that he’s made for me. He makes me laugh and is the truly the sweetest to me. However, he is also my first boyfriend, just to add that piece of information. 

Anyways, since we’ve been together, other than a couple minor hiccups, things have been smooth sailing. However, recently I’ve just had this growing worry that he’s been getting sick of me, and I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic or overthinking it.

I go to school about an hour away from our hometown, but I come back almost every weekend, and the weekends I don’t he comes up to visit me. So we see each other about once a week (usually no more than that unless it’s a break or something). So while it’s not a “long distance” relationship, there is several days in between us seeing each other. 

The past month has been pretty busy for both of us, but especially him, with work and school. Because of this, while we usually would see each other for several hours during our weekly dates and get all dressed up to go to a nearby city (like around 5 hours together), we have only been able to get coffee together for about an hour or two just to see each other. Also, even though this wasn’t an issue in the past, he’s been having longer hours at work that have been having him attend much earlier, so when I see him he’s either tired, or has to go to bed soon, which also has made our hangouts a little less “enjoyable”.

Despite this, we call often (around a couple times a week) and text each other nearly every hour of the day, so I’d say our communication makes up for this busy time. He’s really good at keeping me updated throughout the day. 

However, yesterday when we saw each other, something rubbed me the wrong way. So we got milkshakes together, and as we’re sitting I can tell he’s just really tired. And although I was enjoying our time together, idk, I just had this nagging feeling that I wasn’t being exciting enough or something (may be my anxiety, may be the actual truth, idk). But we spend a couple hours together, he’s being a gentlemen as always (he’s really good at this too), and he was also the one to ask to see me (because I was holding off on being the one to ask him if he was free just to “test my theory”), but usually he’s the one to ask anyways. 

ANYWAYS, eventually it’s getting late and time for me to go home, and he also just looks exhausted, so I’m thinking it’s time to call it a night for both of us. I go home, he texts me how nice it was to see me (I was also waiting for him to do this first) and I’m pretty content. 

Then about an hour after we both go home, he texts me that he’s heading to grab some food with his friends, and at this point it’s pretty late. Now, maybe I’m being dramatic. But the way he looked when I saw him, he looked exhausted. So I’m just wondering, was I just that boring?? Like idk, something about him seemingly not having the energy to spend time with me, but then heading out an after he got home to go see his friends, just made me feel not the greatest. 

I texted him to have fun though, and fell asleep just a bit sad, and I woke up the next day to his good morning and him texting me that he got home. 

I’ve sort of brought up this issue to him before, as there was one week I was back and didn’t see him as much as I could’ve hoped, and told him that I was a little sad about that, and had a feeling he was getting bored of me. He heavily denied this, but I don’t know, I just can’t shake off this feeling. On my end, I feel like nothings really wrong, he treats me right, communicates, and is just great—when I actually get to spend TIME with him. 

Another thing that has me worried, is we used to be a bit more intimate with each other, we’re both virgins, but you know, just do a bit more. But, we had a talk around 2 months ago (he brought it up) about wanting to tone it down a little and “save it” so we don’t go too far. Now this might come off as a red flag, but we’re Arab, and honeslty most of our culture is really strict, so I get this worry that he has of moving too fast, and although it may not make sense to some of you, the reason I’m bringing this up is for the next point: sometimes I can’t tell that him not kissing me or cuddling me as much is because of him trying to wait and restrain, or if he’s just not as attracted to me. On the one hand, he compliments me a lot, and really does make me feel beautiful. On the other, sometimes I just can’t shake off this feeling that something’s wrong. 

I don’t know. I’ve talked about it with him before, and asked him if he truly loves me, if he sees a future with me, if there’s anything wrong, etc. all of which he’s denied and attempted to make me feel better. But I just still have this urge to ASK but I don’t want to just constantly bring up this negativity and make him feel like what he’s doing or the love he’s shown me is not “good enough” or makes me feel loved enough. It’s just been a tough time and I can’t tell if I’m overthinking or if anything’s wrong. He promises that the next month will be better (we’ll both be out of school, and have month off until we start working), but I’m just struggling with this right now. 

Please let me know if I’m over thinking (I will genuinely take that as an answer) or if you see that something else might be wrong.

He’s borderline prediabetic, but it’s under control. He doesn’t smoke or drink and takes magnesium citrate and glycinate as supplements.

On March 18th, he experienced his first episode of atrial fibrillation (AFib). It started after he left the office for lunch. That morning, he had a date shake(something we never drink because of its high sugar content, but I had soaked a few dates and decided to make one.) 
About 3–4 hours later, he complained of palpitations. He had never experienced palpitations before. (Around this time we also cut out coffee, meat like beef and chicken and started a more healthier diet with fish / vegetables/ lentils/beans, no takeout or processed foods etc) 

I gave him my Apple Watch, and we saw his heart rate fluctuating rapidly jumping from 140 bpm to 75, then 130, 80, 135, 120, and so on. Since I’ve had SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) before, we tried various maneuvers to bring his heart rate down, but nothing worked. We ended up in the hospital, where they sedated him and performed a cardioversion.

After that, he was fine and continued with his normal routine. His family doctor followed up and ordered bloodwork, a Holter monitor, and an echocardiogram, all scheduled for next week.

Then today, out of nowhere, it happened again. He had just finished grocery shopping when he suddenly felt the palpitations return. We tried every maneuver again, but nothing helped. Once again, we rushed to the hospital, and they had to cardiovert him.

The ER doctors have no explanation. They checked his thyroid and electrolytes, and everything came back normal. We’re going for more bloodwork tomorrow, but we’re still waiting for a call from the cardiologist.

1jnvtl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jnvtl4/aitah_for_canceling_our_date/,AITAH for canceling our date,"I (45M) recently canceled a date with a woman (33F).

We met on IG in late July of 2024.  Had a few conversations.  In February she said she wanted to see a comedian who was putting a show on close to her area and I offered to take her.  We set the date for April.

Being a man, I wanted to go all out, nice restaurant for dinner, the show, I even offered to pay for her own separate hotel room so she would not have to drive all the way back home.

In March we agreed to meet for a coffee date, see how we got along in person.  It was fantastic.  We spent 10 hours together on that day.  Had breakfast, lunch, and dinner together.  A lot of talking, a visit to a local park, finished the night at Dave and Busters where she beat me at some of the games we played together.

She took photos, posted on her IG story about it.  When we left, we hugged for a long time, neither of us wanting it to end.  She gave me her personal ohone number (previous communication was through DMs) It was just under 4 weeks for our April date night.

I thought we had a connection.  For the next couple weeks, any conversation that was initiated had to come from me.  Her replies started to get slower and keeping her engaged in talking was becoming an issue.  I started to feel like I was chasing someone who did not want me and was only using me.

One morning last week, I heard a song on the radio I thought she would like, so around 830am I said good morning, have a great day and sent the YouTube link for the song.

She read the message about 5 minutes later, no reply.  During the day she posts on IG, replies back to people telling her how beautiful she is, posts stories, 13 hours no reply to my text.

So I go for a drive, wondering if I am overthinking and I decide to break off the date coming up.  She immediately responds asking if my family is ok ( I am a single father, she is also a single mother) and says no worries.  I informed her that there is stuff going on at work that would make it hard to make it.  This is also true for a transfer I am doing that same week and some other stuff going on I did not tell her about and I would not know for sure until April 1st or 2nd.

The next afternoon, she asks me to delete her number and to never contact her again.  I said ""will do"" and I did.

I was never love bombing or sending text after text throughout the days.  It was always light and friendly.  Previously before our first coffee date she said she was so glad that it was me that had offered to take her, I was a man who treated her with respect and honorably.  She said she had so much respect for me.

AITAH for thinking she prioritized responding to random people in her IG story instead of a man that was actually doing something for her?  13 hours was extremely  disrespectful and it told me, those other guys were more important to her than I was.",1,1743397924.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

1jnvqfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1jnvqfo/honeymoon_trip_analysis_6_days_in_tokyo/,Honeymoon Trip Analysis: 6 Days in Tokyo!,"Left from Atlanta, Georgia to Haneda Tokyo Japan Airport on March 23. It was a 13 hour direct flight with no layover and my goodness that was a long flight. Could NOT sleep because it was so cramped and my legs were killing me, despite walking around.

Day 1: Arrival
Arrived at Haneda around 1:30PM on March 24. They required us to go through a quarantine line and wipe our shoes on a sanitizing mat. I guess African Swine Flu is high. Customs was easy providing you do the online customs and declarations form on Visit Japan Web. They also fingerprinted us. They scanned our passport pretty much in every line and everything is done by facial recognition. There’s another security checkpoint we had to go through which we had to go to another kiosk to basically confirm all of our information we already confirmed on Visit Japan Web and it gives you a lane to go through. Once in the airport area we got our IC cards and took the Keikyu line to Yamanote line to Shinjuku where we stayed at Hotel Gracery Shinjuku (the Godzilla hotel). We did get stopped by some Japanese YouTuber dude in the airport who claimed he would give us a free tour of the city and drop us off at the hotel. Whether he was legit or not, we just wanted to go to the hotel since we were exhausted and declined. 

The Hotel Gracery Shinjuku was absolutely amazing. My husband is a huge Godzilla fan and we booked the top floor and he was super happy about all the memorabilia and photos. The Godzilla at the top does go off at 8PM. Breathes fire and plays music. We didn’t know that until after staying there for two days already lol. The view from the top is amazing and honestly I was happy with that view vs. booking the Skytree or Tokyo Tower. 

The hotel overall was very clean and staff were friendly. We didn’t have any issues while staying here. Shinjuku specifically in Kabukicho wasn’t as bad as what I’ve seen on here. Yes the city gets dirty and there’s some sketchy people but we only  really experienced it early morning like between 7-10AM. They clean the street everyday. Honestly still better than downtown Atlanta. Not once did my husband and I feel unsafe. Just use common sense. Don’t go down sketchy alleys. Ignore touts and they won’t bother you. 

7/11 and other konbinis are okay. I wouldn’t say it’s the rant and rave as influencers make it. It’s still convenience store food 🤷‍♀️ vending machines are great. Pocari Sweat is a life saver.

Day 2: Yoyogi Park/Meiji Jingu Shrine, Harajuku, Shibuya

Yoyogi Park and Meiji Jingu Shrine were beautiful. Since we were jet lagged and woke up at 3AM and most shops and store don’t open until 10/11AM we started here first around 7/8AM. Totally worth it.

I didn’t realize how much I would love Harajuku. Although I’m a bigger woman and a lot of the clothes weren’t going to fit, I did find some adorable fashion shoes for really cheap! We went to a gatchapon place and that’s fun! Everything takes 100 yen coins. Went to the Mipig Cafe! It was adorable but I could see how it was an abusive environment for them. The workers weren’t particularly friendly to them and the tourists would not follow the instructions which were clearly posted in multiple languages about not picking up the pigs. I think the pigs liked us the most because we followed the instructions about not bothering them and they kept coming over and my husband had literally all the pigs on him at once lol. The workers kept moving the pigs to go to other people but they kept coming back to us. Others were taking pictures of us since the pigs wouldn’t go to them lol. I wouldn’t call it a cafe though because there was no food and there was a vending machine with drinks and that’s it.

In Shibuya we went to the Disney Store, Mega Don Quijote, and the Nintendo/Pokemon store. Disney Store was adorable and not as crowded. Went to a Korean place called Mom’s Touch for lunch that was pretty good. Just fast food. Shibuya Crossing was cool, but overrated. Mega Don Quijote was an experience lol. Found some good souvenirs and now I have “Donki Ikuyo” stuck in my head forever lmao. Tax free was easy too. Just hand them your passport and they do everything for you. I was surprised at how boring both the Nintendo and Pokemon stores were 😭 everything was overpriced and they didn’t even sell Pokemon cards or if they did they were out. Also the entire day we were looking for a cheap, small backpack for my husband and were surprised to find that absolutely nobody sold backpacks that weren’t oversized or overpriced. Not even Don Quijote. 

We went to a ramen place underneath our hotel and I cannot remember the name and it won’t show up on Google maps for some reason, but it was pretty good! 

Day 3: Tsukiji Outer Market, Daiba (Unicorn Gundam/DiverCity Mall), teamLab Planets, Akihabara

Again, got up early so we went to the fish market. Had some amazingly fresh seafood there! Definitely worth it but go early because it gets mega busy.

So we wanted to go to the Gundam store and it didn’t open until 11AM. We got there around 10AM. We didn’t realize that the Unicorn Gundam moves at 11AM too! That was cool. Also the Gundam Store that showed up on Google Maps is just the one on the outside and NOT the actual at the top of the DiverCity Mall. We also didn’t realize it was a giant mall and there was a queue for the store and we had to head over to teamLAB so we decided to save the Gundam Store and mall for Friday.

teamLab was cool! It wasn’t really what I thought it was, the pictures and influencer videos made it look a lot cooler than it was. It’s also super artsy and interpretive so it didn’t make a lot of sense. I feel like some areas were definitely for kids. It pretty crowded too so that took away from the experience. Definitely cool for some photos but that’s exactly what everyone else was doing so it was hard to do even that.

We were quite exhausted after that and went to Akihabara. We couldn’t really find anything we wanted here despite being video games/anime/manga nerds. We did play at a GiGo which was fun. Won sexy Albedo from Overlord lol. The claw games are harder than they look. Looked for Pokemon card packs and found none anywhere. We gave up looking because we couldn’t find them. They had cards but no booster packs. Some places held them in the back so you had to grab the picture with what you wanted but still no boosters.

Went back to Shinjuku and ate at ACORN right outside the hotel. Pretty good but pricey.

Day 4: Mt. Fuji Tour

Booked a kinda disappointing tour through Klook. We met and took a bus to some popular tourist spots. First place was not THE Lawson but a different Lawson. Apparently the government shut it down because too many people were standing in the streets and getting hurt. 

Next we went to Kawaguchiko Natural Living Center. We were only allowed there for 45 minutes and were told to get the ice cream because it was really good. So we stood in line for about 30 minutes for mediocre ice cream and had to leave. 

Next we went to Oshino Hakkai and were allowed an hour and a half to get lunch at an EXTREMELY overpriced “traditional” Japanese restaurant. For me and my husband it was $100 USD. Don’t get me wrong the food was good but we were not expecting that price. Also by the time we got our food we had to go. 

Lastly, we went to Arakurayama Sengen Park. Climbed lots of steps for a kinda terrible view with all the tourists there. Again, only allowed like an hour and a half, so we climbed up, took some photos, and came back down. I thought there was more to the tour but apparently not.

Idk what I did see was cool and I got some cool photos! But it was all quick and rushed and I feel like we could’ve done this tour ourselves and took our time in two of these places.

Tour guide was okay but she was kinda rude and rushed us in every place we were. I understood we were on a schedule but she just didn’t care and kept threatening to leave us if we didn’t come back in time. 

Back in Shinjuku we went to Shabu Shabu Niimura (tour guide recommended). It was also like $100 USD. Food was at least very good but we’ve never had Shabu Shabu before so our waitress had to help us and we felt bad because she barely spoke English. 

Day 5: Ueno Park, Ueno Zoo, Back to DiverCity Mall and Harajuku/Shibuya

Decided to go to Ueno Park to see the cherry blossoms despite seeing some in Daiba the other day. We saw the zoo and decided to do that instead of Senso-ji. Honestly the temples are cool, but they all feel the same once you’ve seen a few. If it’s your thing though and you have time definitely go visit them! 

Ueno Zoo was nice and the animals were lively! I wasn’t going to wait an hour to see the giant pandas though. Tickets for the zoo were like 600 yen a person so totally worth it! They said it was crowded but it really wasn’t everywhere but the panda exhibit. Also a lot bigger of a zoo than it looks!

Went back to DiverCity mall to go wait at the Gundam Store. After about an hour to an hour and a half of waiting. We finally went in! Prices were better than the US. Around $50-100 for HG and MG vs. like $100+ here in the US. Went to the Godzilla store too! It’s a little overpriced though! Cool merch!

We dropped our stuff off at the hotel and went back to Harajuku. I was mostly looking for something to wear for the trip back home but was very unsuccessful in finding shorts. Ended up back at the Mega Don Quijote and had to get men’s shorts because that’s all they had that fit. Even men’s shorts were hard to find. By the end of the day mine and my husband’s feet were killing us so we just got a bunch of snacks from 7/11 and called it dinner.

Day 6: Homebound from Narita Airport 

It was cheaper to book a flight at separate airports. The worst part of leaving was taking the Skyliner tbh. We took Yamanote to Nippori Station and we were trying to get tickets for the Skyliner (you need to get a liner ticket and a seat ticket and I knew this). Despite the instructions on the self service kiosk having an English option. It only spit out the liner ticket and not the seat ticket. Meanwhile we missed the train and the actual ticket counter people didn’t speak very good English. I guess we needed to insert the liner ticket and the seat ticket together AND use our IC cards? Idk that’s what they made us do. Once we got there we just needed to insert the liner ticket to exit. Did not make any sense.

At the airport we checked all over our bags (we had 3 and it was free and easier) and just went through security and then to our gate. Wasn’t very difficult. We took a plane to Seoul (ICN) for our layover. It was 3 hours and we took Korean Airlines. Food was amazing! Layover was only 2 and a half hours and we went through another security checkpoint and then to our new gate. Everything was booked through Delta and Korean Airlines is a partner of Delta so we did not need to pick up our checked luggage until our final destination which was Atlanta in this case. However, there was an issue on their end with our passport pre check submission (I was having issues on the FlyDelta app the day of too). They just reverified our passports and all was good. 

The flight back was okay. 13 hours back again and the food was worse than on the way. Both the flight to Japan and back were completely full. I got compression socks this time so it wasn’t too bad. I was able to sleep despite the turbulence being horrendous the entire ride home. Didn’t level out until we were over the states but started to pick up again as we were landing.

Getting through customs was easy. Checked our passports, asked where we were coming from and how long we stayed, asked if we had anything over $800 to declare and then we exited no problem. 

Severely jet lagged today (March 30). I felt sick all day and slept. But best trip of my life! An experience you definitely can’t get in the US!

Tips/Advice:

If you’re booking a long haul flight definitely get upgraded seats or a layover to break up the time.

Don’t worry about not speaking Japanese. Honestly nobody cared that we didn’t speak Japanese and even spoke a lot of English. We could communicate even if they didn’t speak English very well.

There was a lot of ignorance (and it wasn’t the Americans surprisingly just telling by their accents. Spoke English, not American). A lot of the tourists at the Mipig cafe weren’t following instructions and feeling entitled because the pigs wouldn’t come over to them. The instructions are sit down, don’t call them, don’t pick them up, and let them come to you. No one listened to that except us and like two other groups. There was a mom there that was telling the workers to bring the pigs over to their bratty kids because they wouldn’t sit still to let the pigs come to them. In Tsukiji Market I saw an adult woman literally kick a pigeon. It wasn’t doing anything but walking. I wanted to walk over and kick her. At the Shabu Shabu place, a giant group came in a demanded French fries??? When they CLEARLY did not serve French fries?? Poor waitress was trying to explain the best she could that they didn’t serve French fries and they just weren’t listening. Like there’s a McDonald’s down the street. Just go there. At the ticket counter for the Skyliner, a man was asking for a ticket to London 🤦‍♀️ not to the airport, to London.

Some of the etiquette thing doesn’t really matter when it comes to certain things. I hardly seen anyone bow, if they did it was older locals. Walking on the left side is mostly a thing? If it’s crowded, everyone just walks wherever. The escalators are small and they do stay to the left if not moving. Arigato or arigato gozaimasu is appreciated but most of the time if they know you speak English they’ll just say thank you.

Train transportation is kinda confusing but if you have an IC card it’ll definitely make it easier. Just follow the signs and listen to the announcements (that are both in Japanese and English, even Korean in some of the trains). Also Google maps is helpful, except when it couldn’t find my exact location for some reason and would say I’m going the wrong way when I wasn’t 😭😭 (I had AT&T’s international plan since my SIM is locked and I can’t have it unlocked because it’s not paid off). 

I wouldn’t recommend Klook for tours tbh. Everything that was on the itinerary was kinda thrown out the window and changed. It was also rushed despite it being an 8 hour tour.

Shinjuku Kabukicho isn’t that bad. I felt safe the entire time and nobody hardly bothered us. It’s dirty, but so is Shibuya at night. And y’all haven’t visited downtown Atlanta 😭😂

Influencer stuff is definitely overrated, make your own itinerary based off of your interests. 

You’ll be walking closer to 30k steps, not 20k. At least we did 😭 we were also trying to cram everything in since we didn’t have much time. Dr. Scholls are useless. Both my husband and I had some good Nike running shoes and we got the inserts and it made our feet problems worse. Shoes were broken in a month in advance. People were telling me to get better shoes and I’m not spending $300 on shoes. These shoes were already $100 each. I wish we stayed longer but we had to leave our daughter at home with grandparents. She did well but she’s our first and we missed her. She’s only a year old.

Fast food was kinda comfort food for us. Even though it was a little different. Definitely cheaper. Food for me and my husband was like $10 USD for both vs like $20 here in the US. Starbucks was no different and I was kinda disappointed because I love coffee. Also portion sizes are smaller than US but that wasn’t really an issue.

Don’t come expecting things to be significantly cheaper. Like designer and electronic wise. Sure it’s not $500 USD but it’s still like $100-200 USD and to me that’s still expensive. I’m also a cheapskate lol. Shoes are cheaper though. Like $15-20 USD vs $50+ USD. Polaroid film was the same price (I brought my Polaroid for photos) I guess it makes sense because it’s a US brand.

The bathrooms either have soap, and no paper towels or hand dryer, or vice versa. Most of the time it was no soap. Despite that, the restrooms were very clean and I haven’t felt sick (yet). Also I thought with the cherry blossoms my allergies would act up but they did not.

It’s true there’s no trash cans throughout the city. A lot of the parks have them though.

Total we spent about $6000ish USD

$5000ish USD for hotel and flights

$80 USD for Klook tour

$1000 USD for food, souvenirs, IC card/travel, and everything else 

Favorite souvenir is this keychain that has the station as it shows on the train screen. I didn’t know they had one with the station jingles and now I’m sad I didn’t get that one instead 😭

No issues with medication (Buspar 15mg, Lexapro 20 mg, Strattera 18mg). They didn’t even question it.

Best trip ever and next time we’ll stay longer and bring our daughter along!",5,1743397580.0,JapanTravelTips,0,0.86,False

I’m reminded of your sweet smile beaming at me when I look at the corner of my couch. I’m reminded of your laugh when I watch our favorite tv shows on repeat, I’m reminded of your kisses when I make my coffee in the morning, I’m reminded of the way your body feels next to mine when I see your t-shirts in my drawers…..

But then the sad reality of you being gone creeps up on the now silent walls of my house and encompasses me with the loneliness of your absence. I realize that I need to erase all memories of you if I wanted a chance at moving on, and I wish it were easy. 

The memories of you are happy in the cruelest way because they remind me that I will never get to banter on the couch with you or see your smile again, I will never get to wait for you so we can watch a new episode together or laugh with you again, I will never get to make you your coffee before work every morning again, and I will never get to get ready with you so we can match outfits or help you take your clothes off at night before we cuddle to sleep again. It pains me, it’s too much, I don’t want these memories anymore. 

You reached out to me a few days ago and as much as I want to respond to you, I know it’s better for both our sakes if I don’t. In fact, I can’t respond. I know myself well enough to know that it won’t take much for me to want to fall right back into your arms, a place where I no longer belong in. So while it may seem like I’m not missing you right now, I promise you that I do. I miss you bubba, I really really do and I hope that one day we can be friends again. For now, I have to protect myself and keep a distance.

1jnvmqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1jnvmqs/my_completed_starbucks_mug_collection_is_the/,"My Completed Starbucks Mug Collection is the Pinnacle of Human Achievement, and No One Appreciates It","Yesterday was my final stop in completing geographical coffee-based dominance. Washington was the last stop and let me tell you, I could practically hear the Hallelujah chorus playing in the background. I discretely swipe the ""Been There"" mug from the shelf. With this mug in hand, I’m not just a man—I'm a walking ray of sunshine, and I’ve just single-handedly broken the perpetual gray Seattle sky. The Pacific Northwest might as well make a monument of me.

I'm strutting to the counter. The barista, a young woman with eyes that held the vacant stare of someone who’d seen too many pumpkin spice lattes, asked for my order.

“Venti mocha cookie Frappuccino with 2%, 6 pumps mocha, extra caramel and mocha drizzle, 4 pumps dark caramel and cinnamon powder, and… oh yes,” I paused, letting the tension build, “this location-specific mug.” I lifted the mug to the counter, the ceramic reflecting the harsh fluorescent light like a sacred artifact.

The barista blinked, her gaze flickering between the mug and my face. ""Uh, okay. That'll be $28.75.""

$28.75? Chump change for an investment that is worth its weight in gold. I’m a collector. A connoisseur. A purveyor of caffeinated cartography. Sure, Arizona felt like being roasted alive in an oven, but nothing says W like pulling off a heat wave miracle with so much sweat you wonder if it is the humidity or just the sheer weight of accomplishment.

I whipped out my Starbucks reward card, letting it shimmer like the beacon of light that it is. “This card has seen more miles than the iced lattes you’ll serve in your entire career.”

She swiped my card without saying anything. She didn't have to. She knew I was a legend making history.

I simply smiled, a knowing, almost pitying smile. I felt bad for her knowing she would have to go to sleep every night knowing she her best day was now behind her. I leaned in and revealed my meticulously curated spreadsheet of every Starbucks location I'd visited. This is not mere data. This is a chronicle. A saga of caffeine-fueled conquest.

It took years of dedication, a caffeine tolerance that borders on medical anomaly, and raw determination to complete. I own every single Starbucks “Been There” mug from every U.S. state.

Hawaii? Got it. Took three flights, a layover in Denver, and a rental car that smelled like the inside of a forgotten gym bag, but I secured the mug.

North Dakota? Nearly froze to death, but yes. It sits proudly next to South Dakota, because I respect geographical accuracy.

Rhode Island? Small state. Big win.

I made sure every barista knew they were a part of my journey of greatness. They said ""thank you,"" and you could tell they really meant it. The barista in Chicago even compared me to the Great Lakes. But if she'd seen the lighting I’ve got set up for my 50 mug display, she'd realize that comparison is more like comparing the Eiffel Tower to your local AT&T cell tower.

Take this morning, for example. I invite my coworker over for coffee. Casual, yet calculated. The stage is set. I have arranged all fifty mugs on the counter, the color palette a breathtaking masterpiece of corporate-approved design.

He walks in, barely looking up from his phone. “Nice kitchen.”

Nice kitchen. Nice kitchen?

I clear my throat and gesture grandly. “You’re not seeing the real feature here.”

He finally looks. Squints. “Oh. You have a lot of mugs.”

A lot of mugs? This is not “a lot of mugs.” This is the full Starbucks U.S. state collection. This is a testament to human perseverance.

I give him a moment to absorb the sheer magnitude of what’s in front of him. “That’s every single state.”

He nods. Nods. Like I just told him I own a Honda Civic.

“You’re looking at over three years of dedication,” I continue, undeterred. “Do you know how hard it is to get the Alaska mug? You can’t just waltz into a store and pick one up. You have to plan. You have to sacrifice.”

“Cool,” he says, already looking back at his phone. “Hey, do you have oat milk?”

Oat milk. This man stands in the presence of greatness, and he wants to talk about milk.

I pour his coffee in the Kansas mug because that is how I feel about him right now. He scrolls through TikTok, blissfully unaware that he is in the presence of a legend.

But that’s fine. True pioneers are often misunderstood.

I take a slow sip from my California mug, letting the warmth of my accomplishment fill me.

They’re living in a world of decaf and I am a nitro cold brew. That’s fine. Legends are never recognized in their time.

Advice on how to deal?,"My now ex and I had been dating for almost 4 years and had been friends for almost a year prior to dating. I loved, and still love, him with my entire heart. I feel like he feels the same. But, we are in the situation we are in. He broke up with me earlier this month. I'm looking for advice on how to deal with the more painful aspects of the breakup and how to move forward with time. Account is a side account because I'm pretty sure he knows my actual reddit, haha.

My ex was my absolute best friend. I saw him get more and more depressed, especially in the past few months. There wasn't anything I could do, and it was heartbreaking. I think it tore us apart. He kept getting so stuck inside his own head that I barely existed for him. It was more like an idea of me that he kept comparing himself to. He became so insecure and so stressed out. We did couples counseling, and that was helpful, but not helpful enough. He used to have a personal therapist, but after his insurance switched and he couldn't see her anymore, he never decided to go back. I asked him a few times to try going back, but didn't want to push. I didn't want the reason for him to get therapy to be because *I* wanted him to. I wanted him to want it for himself, and I couldn't do that.

He broke up with me kind of out of nowhere. Middle of the workweek. During finals. I had no idea it was coming and felt so side swept. He never brought anything up to me. I knew he was depressed, but he never talked to me about it. I tried to bring in up in the ways that I could without pushing too hard, but to no avail.

I cried all day at work (they did not let me have a day off... I quit and have a new job starting in a couple weeks haha). He came back the weekend after to grab all his stuff. We spent the day together, talking and separating everything. It was a lot of crying and a lot of love. We made a plan. In a year, he might reach out to me and, if I respond, we might try and get coffee to be friends again or something. Maybe even try again. We talked about how we both want that to happen, but also recognize that we ultimately should not expect anything. We can't. It wouldn't be fair. We also did a final session with our couples therapist, who was also surprised by the breakup. He vaguely hinted at us getting back together, which was potentially a little inappropriate but at least it was funny. 

When we talked while he was over, grabbing his stuff, I asked him if he was 100% sure he was ready to leave me. He said 'no.' During our couples' session, I asked him if he fully understood that I was out of his life now. He said 'no.' It broke my heart a little bit more. I don't know why he'd run away if he wasn't sure on his choices, but I guess that's part of the growing he needs to do. And me too.

The advice I'm looking for is... how to honor our memories and our time together, but keep it going for me? I don't want to slow myself down and lose my own momentum. I have a lot of really cool things going on in my life, but I keep getting so scared that this breakup will lead me to a full-on nervous breakdown. I've already had some other insane things happen this year, and it's only March! I keep eating myself up at the thought of him finding someone else. I have no right to be so anxious, since we've parted ways, but the thought kills me. I hate the thought of finding someone else. I never wanted anyone but him. I hate the thought of growing without him. I still love him, and hate how he did what he did. I get healing is a process, but, boy, does the process stink! How do I deal with all the emotions, pain, and love I still have? What are helpful ways y'all have processed? I appreciate any and all responses. Thank you.

1jnvj1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1jnvj1y/what_ive_done_to_still_be_productive_as_an/,What I've done to still be productive as an insomniac,"Sorry in advance if this whole post will seem somewhat messy, it's somewhat hard to describe what I've been doing, but hopefully what i'm trying to say gets across. also sorry if this all might have been said somewhere else before. i just wanna share what i've been doing that's helped me a lot.

But, I'm a 4th year nursing student studying that will hopefully be graduating this May, while also working a part time job. I'm also in a relationship with my gf taking care of a 1.5 year old baby. with all of these things going on, I don't get much sleep, and i've been diagnosed with insomnia now, which i'm sure a lot of us also may have. For a few months now, I've been tracking the amount of sleep I get every night, and it's a staggering: 3 hours and 22 minutes each night. a lot of days, I can barely get up out of bed to go to school or work. however, for some time now i've changed some of my habits to where i still struggle to get out, but i'm able to keep going the whole day. I'm still able to study, take care of my daughter, etc. on such little sleep. here's what I've done.

**1. Don't take naps/Take short naps instead of long ones**

before I'd usually take 1 nap a day, usually around noon time or later in the day. it would usually be 2 hours long, and after I'd wake up i would get back to doing stuff. however, even after the long naps my energy would still crash, and i felt like i needed to have another nap. it would be this way, and naps ended up having the opposite affect on me. so, i switched it up, and started taking around 2-3 20 minutes nap everyday instead. I take them whenever i'm free, which with how my classes/job is pretty frequently. I felt less sleepy having these shorter naps, and i would spread out my energy levels better. 

although i still take naps, if you're able to resist the urge to take any, that would be the best. it's hard, and if you truly need to sleep, don't go against what you're body is saying. however, if you can go without it your energy won't crash as much.

  
**2. Try to not use any quick-relief products to help keep you awake**

it's hard to not end up drinking coffee or an energy drink or something to wake you up. however, when i was drinking them almost 3-4 times a day, I became super dependent on them to even function regularly. it eventually went to the point where the amount of caffeine i was consume became too little for me, and i ended up drinking even more coffee, more energy drinks, etc. 

if you can, try to go cold turkey with caffeine as long as you can. if you can't, i'd limit my caffeine intake or my energy boosting drinks to 1-2 dosages/drinks a day. then, with those drinks, you can select what times you need to have that boost of energy, and you can last longer. On that same note, i've been able to increase my energy throughout the day with this next thing.

**3. Get all of your essential vitamins/minerals and good antioxidants**

i think most of us can agree that eating a good diet helps with everything, including our health and mental clarity. I'm lucky that my girlfriend and i do make some form of meal prep every week, and that we have a lot good sources for healthy food nearby near us, albeit expensive stores. however, what i've focused on the most when it comes to what i eat or take it the vitamins and antioxidants i get.

getting of course all of the essential vitamins like vitamin C, D, B12, folic acid, etc. should be a priority. i would also put a big emphasis on potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium especially. these are all essential for our bodies hydration, and we need to stay hydrated in order to keep going. it should also go without saying that water is a must. I personally drink about an ounce of water per pound of body weight i am, so between 135-140 oz. Depending on any medical issues you may have (ie. kidney problems) don't drink as much water as that. but, always be hydrated.

similarly, consuming good antioxidants has been crucial for me. they've helped me feel less tired, and in a way less in need of sleep. i consume a wide variety of different supplements, however some more notable ones include shilajit, sea moss, and ginseng. i know a lot of these supplements are buzz words right now, and they're also super pricey. but trust me, they've really helped me a ton. eating foods high in antioxidants helped as well, like beetroot and berries. getting antioxidants like catechin, astaxanthin, fulvic acid, and more will help you a lot.

  
**4. Meditate**

personally i'm religious, so I do pray and stuff. however, meditating and just clearing your mind has been a big game changer for me. i thought before that being so relaxed would make me more sleepy, but it's had the opposite affect. i'm not more tired, bur rather i feel more decisive. i feel as if i'm able to stay focused and productive far longer.

i'd recommend practicing certain breathing techniques first. the more you do them, the more you'll be able to really relax your mind. another thing that also helped me clear my mind is certain types of music. classical music has helped me calm down a lot, and songs with certain frequencies also help you relax more.

**Closing Statement** 

There's a bunch of little stuff that I do that help me stay awake and productive. i've been so sleep deprived for so long, that now I'm becoming more and more used to it. i'm still not good, but i'm able to work and study without much brain fog.

People are also different. these things have worked for me, but some of the people i talk to who also have insomnia do the opposite stuff as me. they take a bunch of naps, drink a bunch of energy drinks, etc. and they do fine in their own regards. ultimately, the best thing you can do to be productive while sleep deprived, is to listen to your body. make the most of your sleep, don't use your phone beforehand or waste away before bed. don't force anything against your body, because in the long run you'll be so worn down that you'll have no choice but to sleep.

sorry if this whole post was lackluster in the info, but i hope it helps whoever is reading this. thank you!

I started taking **Methylphenidate Ritalin** at 5mg (half a tablet), and it was super helpful at first. But as I got used to it, 5mg started making me **drowsy** and didn’t feel as effective anymore. So, following my doctor’s advice, I **moved up to 10mg (one tablet)**.

Now here’s the weird part — even **10mg is making me sleepy lately**. From what I’ve observed, **taking 15mg (one and a half tablets) doesn’t make me drowsy.** I’m planning to keep an eye on this and talk to my doctor soon.

Another thing: **caffeine** also makes me sleepy. Same as medicine, I’ll drink coffee and feel foggy, kinda tired and spaced out — not really able to nap, but my brain just feels off. I literally bumped into a wall after a cup earlier today.

**For context**, I’m also on **Sertraline** for depression. I’ve **tried Concerta before**, but it made me *super sleepy during the day and wired at night*, so I stopped. My sleep quality isn’t great either, and melatonin works inconsistently.

Is this an ADHD thing? Or maybe caffeine allergy or something else?

1jnvgvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1jnvgvw/marriage_in_vietnam_as_a_foreigner_experience/,Marriage in Vietnam as a foreigner experience,"So I was preparing to get married in Vietnam and was trying to get the paperwork ready in the US. I made a huge mistake and wasted a lot of time and money, so don't make the same mistake as me. I was initially following this [list of requirements](https://vn.usembassy.gov/marriage/). I thought I could get each of those requirements like Affidavit of Single Status, Record of no marriage myself in the US first. I made the mistake of trying to get these papers notarized and translated by a public notary in the US. Don't do this! I came to Vietnam with these papers and they said it was useless and to throw it away and had to rush to make a real appointment for the real documents, with the aid of some lawyers based in the US but had staff physically in Vietnam to help. Luckily everything turned out okay.

So what you need to do is, online, make an appointment to go to the U.S. Consulate, Đại sứ quán, in Saigon or Hanoi for a marriage application. Once there, you can have someone wait outside to hold your stuff for you, there is highland coffee next to the consulate in saigon. What you need to bring inside is your passport and the printed form for the Affidavit of Single Status, Độc Thân and the form for the certified copy of the foreigner's passport, and some money. These are the only two you need to get notarized and each document costs $50 so $100 in total. I recommend bringing cash, like a clean $100 but I believe they also accept debit cards. When entering the consulate, you will pass through security where you leave your phone in a locked box and go into a few rooms with other people waiting for their appointments, such as trying to get their lost passport replaced, interview for entering the US and other marriage applicants. 

Once they call your name, you tell them the purpose of what you are doing there, and you give them the forms and your passport and pay the fee. Wait a bit and then they will come back with documents with the official red stamp and seal. Once that is done, they will ask if you are planning to use this document in Vietnam or outside. Since I was getting married in Vietnam, I said in Vietnam. Then they gave some instructions to go to another government building nearby to authorize the signature. However, I did not do this part personally, because I had a vietnamese lawyer (name of the tax/immigration office was “TOAN VU” from Oakland california).  helped us and they took care of that for us. And they also printed out the forms for us (after we emailed them all our scanned documents) and told us what to sign. And the staff waited outside for me. Their service was $200, which seems fair as they took care of all the paperwork for us. And since I messed up right before, I had to make sure everything was 100% correctly done this time. Unless you are good at Vietnamese law, I’d recommend just paying an expert to do the paperwork and make the appointments for you. Then I waited a day, this staff person came to our hotel and dropped off the documents once the signature authorization was done. So in summary, the two papers that you need notarized with the red stamp at the US embassy/consulate in SGN or HN are the single status paper and the certified copy of passport. Since the form is already in Vietnamese and English, it doesn't need to be translated.

After you have those two documents, go back to your spouse's home province. Make sure you get a photo printout 3x4 cm of your photograph and your spouses’, there are a lot of places that do copy and photographs, they also photoshop to make the photos look professional. The final document you need is the mental health exam. This has to be done at the local hospital, not a big international hospital like vinmec or anything. You don’t need to make appointments, just show up, just that they close on weekends I believe. You can tell that the hospital offers this service since the hospital often has a big board that lists the medical services and marriage mental health exam should be one of them. I read online of someone's experience that they make you put probes and electrical sensors on your brain and take urine tests. We were not subjected to that extent but all we had to do was just take an IQ test, which was the Raven's Progressive Matrices for pattern recognition. You and your spouse go into different rooms and the staff steps out to let you work on the test. Tbh, I finished pretty quickly but my wife was slow at taking the test and so just went into my room and copied my answers, I guess no one noticed or cared 😂. They check your answers to the IQ test, then you go over to the psychologist office where the psychologist reviews your information and asks some basic questions. For example, they asked me, “What is the capital of the US?”, to which I replied quickly, Washington D.C., to make sure I know why I’m there and I’m not dumb. After that, they sign the doctor’s note that you mentally well and not being coerced or anything, attach the face pictures to the paper, and they stamp it and you're good to go.

After you have those 3 documents, go to the People’s district committee, huyện ủy in your spouse’s home province/town. Before you enter the building, make sure you wear pants, same with the US consulate, because they won’t let you in if you wear shorts and flip flops. Then there will be someone that will help you do the marriage application. Once they have everything they will process the marriage application. Normally, for foreigners it takes 3 weeks to get it back, but I was in a rush and needed it done in 3 days before I leave. So my wife asked if it could be done faster, which I thought involved paying bribe money, but tbh, the staff was understanding and didn’t request extra money besides the standard application fee of around 1 million. After they give the completed marriage application back, which is an official government document with red paper, you will get a chance to sign it. I recommend recording it as a lot of people seem to do it on social media. After that you are all set and officially married and that marriage is also legal and recognized in the US also. The whole process is quite cumbersome for a foreigner, at least compared to two local vietnamese marrying, as you have to go to the capital or SG and take some hospital tests. But besides that, if you have external help, and native spouse, the marriage process is pretty straightforward.",8,1743396535.0,VietNam,1,0.79,False

Finally getting back into riding bikes...

I'm now living in a very friendly bike city (BKK), I've been riding a 160cc scooter in various cities in SEA over the last 3 years (Very comfrotable riding in the heavy traffic and condensed city area). I know this is not the same as riding a geared bike (Allow some understanding here).

I have little experience riding dirt bikes as a kid and have recently re-ignited the desire to get back on a ""real"" bike..

I signed up for some 1:1 classes to re-fresh my memory with the clutch and will be easing my way into it.

Looking for a new bike\~  
\- Something with a compact size (I need something not much bigger or within the same constraisnts as the scooter, much better for city riding and lane splitting as traffic here is bad and splitting is beyond common here)

I'm 6'2, long legs and arms..  
Flaoting around the low mid 80KG's

I've been eyeing a Ducati Hyper moto at my local coffee spot and it seems to be visually exactly what i'm looking for, something fun to get around the city, something I can take out for a fun ride.. More upright seating position (reminicenst of a dirt bike).

I'm aware this is probably not the best bike to be jumping back onto so i'm looking for any recs or advice on where I should be looking... Keep in mind I highly value my safety and would plan to run the bike on rain mode for atleast the first 3 months as I build confidence and get my footing again. Would be looking for something I can grow into a bit and would not plan on selling within the first 2-3 years at least...

\~Notes  
\- Not looking for a pure street bike (R15,R3, Ninja 3, 600cc etc...)  
\- Prefer the naked or hyper moto style (Have considered the Duke)  
\- Love anything styled like the Indian FTR

1jnvfmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeerotation/comments/1jnvfmz/community_suggestion/,Community suggestion,"Hi all. First off I want to say that I have benefited tremendously from the hard work and good will of daddy dials so I want to reiterate that while this has been an overwhelming experience of trying to choose which coffee grab bag to hack into in the morning, I have found that letting go of the notion of choice and just letting the random basket of goodies guide me has been a fun way to experience coffee rotation as it’s meant to be. 


I find that drinking a new random bag every morning is actually closer to what I do when I’m on vacation and visiting random coffee shops. One morning, one chance, one cup, and that’s it. So instead of originally viewing the rotation system as an opportunity to “try before you buy”, I have found that the greatest bliss from this product is giving me a coffee experience reminiscent of vacations. And I don’t even need to put on pants. 

One suggestion from a community perspective is if we can create a way to tag posts with coffee brands so that after we drink our random cups, we can look at how other people have experienced or commented on those beans. Doing it by bean may be overwhelming but doing it by roaster like DAK Glitch or Sey or whatever could be a great way to discuss.  Especially since I’ve found that I gravitate towards certain brands more than others 

That’s it. Everything’s been great so far and thanks again all to everyone who keeps the subreddit fresh ",1,1743396398.0,coffeerotation,4,0.57,False

I consider parallel play to be similarly off-putting. It's really hard for me to get anything done when other people are around, I can't relax even if it's my family/friends because I feel like I'm still masking on some level. I hate being watched and I almost always prefer to just be alone. 

I mean I love planned hangouts and meeting friends for coffee or something specific, but just sitting around with other people is unpleasant after a while. Even if the other person in the room is completely quiet and minding their business, all I can think about is how I wish they'd go somewhere else. I'm just hyperaware of their presence or something.

I think this is definitely linked to my neurodivergence but I also grew up an only child so I think that's why solo time feels the most natural to me.

I'm a long-term observer and first-time poster, and I was hoping to get some feedback on my query. I’d particularly appreciate thoughts on the query’s clarity, hook effectiveness, and overall intrigue.

Thank you!

Dear {agent},

In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's assassination plunged America into chaos, leading to the rise of a fascist regime aligned with Nazi Germany. SHADOW OF THE EAGLE is an 83,000-word upmarket alternate historical thriller exploring this chilling alternate reality.

This character-driven thriller blends speculative history with emotional grit, exploring themes of loyalty, complicity, and the quiet rebellion of ordinary people caught in extraordinary times.

Henry Locke is no spy. A Great War veteran, McGill graduate, and former NHL player, he now advises a powerful Canadian media mogul whose political ambitions are sliding dangerously toward fascism. Secretly recruited as an informer by an influential Canadian senator, Henry learns of a covert summit in upstate New York—a secret meeting of fascist leaders plotting the future of the continent. When Henry’s employer appears on the guest list, Henry is reluctantly thrust into the role of spy.

At Vanderleigh Hall, American generals, Nazi officials, and ruthless industrialists gather to carve out a new order—one that threatens everything Henry values. Surrounded by enemies, Henry must navigate this den of fascists, drawing on every skill he possesses to survive, uncover critical intelligence, and protect his country's fragile freedom.

SHADOW OF THE EAGLE combines the historical tension of Robert Harris’s *Munich*, the grounded spycraft and psychological complexity of Jason Matthews’s *Red Sparrow*, and the atmospheric stakes and emotional depth of Kate Quinn’s *The Alice Network*.

Thank you for considering my manuscript. I look forward to hearing back from you.

PROLOGUE: THE MESSAGE

Wednesday, November 17, 1937.

Albany, New York.

The bread was stale, the ham was too salty, and the cheese was barely passable. Edward Campbell forced it down anyway. His stomach was in knots, but eating kept his hands busy.

The coffee was better. Stronger than he expected. Real beans—rare now, especially in a place like this. He sipped from a chipped porcelain cup, careful not to spill as his hands trembled slightly.

Edward shifted uneasily, feeling Yankee eyes everywhere.

Outside, the sky above Albany’s warehouse district hung low and heavy, an ominous gray slab threatening rain. A drizzle slicked the sidewalks while the last stubborn leaves of late autumn clung to the trees—muted yellows and oranges, dulled by the dampness.

Pedestrians hurried past the window, heads down, collars turned up, hats held tight against the wind—a streetcar clattered by its wheels hissing on the wet tracks.

Inside, the diner was half-full—a blend of travellers waiting for a destination and locals resigned to having nowhere to go. Their conversations hummed gently, merging with the clatter of cutlery and the occasional hiss of the coffee machine.

A few tables over, four men laughed too loudly. Their presence wasn’t casual. It was a statement.

They wore the silver-grey uniforms of the Eagle Guard—street enforcers of the new regime. Silver Shirts. The eagle-and-lightning insignia caught the low diner lights, stitched onto their breast pockets—a twisted echo of old American patriotism.

One gestured sharply, palm down—a motion that once meant nothing. Now, it carried weight.

His companions chuckled, their boots planted wide, their posture one of ownership, not presence.

Edward forced his gaze back down to his plate.",1,1743396194.0,PubTips,1,1.0,False

* **Mis-clicked cups get wasted** – If you accidentally grab the wrong cup, you have to throw it away instead of just putting it back. This feels unrealistic and wasteful => Allow cups to be placed back
* **Bad product placement** – Toppings like strawberries and vanilla beans/flowers are positioned awkwardly, requiring constant scrolling to access them => Make toppings more accessible by grouping them better or allowing players to customize their layout. A quick-access menu could also help.
* **Accidental drink disposal** – The constant back-and-forth scrolling makes it way too easy to throw drinks away by mistake while making them => Add an “undo” button 
* **Espresso calibration issue** – When using the coffee machine with two cup placements, frothing milk blocks the view of the espresso progress, making it hard to calibrate properly => When frothing milk, the espresso progress should still be visible, either by repositioning UI elements or adding a transparency effect.

I love the concept of the game, but these small annoyances really add up. These small changes would make the game much smoother to play on mobile.

For the first time in my LIFE I actually wore all the same clothes in the same sizes, year after year. It was amazing, and I never stopped celebrating.

However…at the beginning of March, I started taking a new medication, and it threw everything out of whack. I noticed myself suddenly getting bigger and gaining fat, at an alarming rate. At first I thought maybe it was just bloating from the meds, but when I started paying attention, I noticed that I was  eating a WHOLE lot more. I get hungry at times I used to never eat, continue snacking after meals, and find myself obsessing over junk food. It was like all the signals I usually followed to intuit what and when to eat were just off, and I couldn’t ignore them. I humbly admit now, in the past, I completely underestimated and never understood people attributing weight gain to appetite-stimulating medications — but now I get it.  The hunger is so strong, and it’s like my usual logic and self-control is overridden. (Not limited to food only either; I also started somewhat over-consuming coffee/caffeine and alcohol, both of which I never had a problem with before.)

That said, I am taking responsibility now that I’ve noticed what’s going on, and I want to stop the weight gain in its tracks. I re-gained about 15 lbs, and I feel so much heavier and not as energetic, sleeping poorly due to overeating before bed, unable to enjoy my workouts or even playing around with my kids. Just feeling all over crappy. It sucks to feel like I’ve gone backward, but instead of swelling, I just want to feel better again — and definitely not experience what it’d feel like to re-gain all 50!

I don’t love the thought of going back to monitoring my weight and being more stringent with my diet, after all these years of maintaining pretty effortlessly. But fighting against external factors now, I feel like I will need the extra motivation to get me back to better habits. I’ve started by purging the house of high-calorie foods it’s easy to overeat, and prepping things like meats and salads to reach for when I can’t resist eating between regular meals, so that at least I can damage control. And I’ll be back to using the scale on a more regular basis to keep track of where I am.

If anyone else out there has experienced weight gain due to appetite-increasing medications, it would be a real comfort to hear, both experiences and any advice!",11,1743395794.0,loseit,5,1.0,False

I originally wasn't going to cuz Im a pussy and before her Ive never asked someone out before/confessed to them. For some background Im a very avoidant person, the second something becomes to difficult I pull back and ignore it till it ""goes away"", even though it never does. I noticed that whenever she was around I would just feel sad, I guess sad that I liked her so much but she wasn't ""mine"", for lack of a better word. Anyways yea I would just distance myself from her and I thought I was being slick but she noticed. She had pulled me aside and asked if everything was okay with me and that if I was mad at her. I played it off and just said I was tired but later that day I felt bad and had texted her saying that I was just dealing with something personal. Her reply made me feel worse though cause she basically said something along the lines of ""Its probably me making things up"" and I didn't want her to gaslight herself cause I knew what I was doing. I decided then to just rip the bandaid off and be honest. I told her that I was being distant because I liked her a lot and was afraid of humiliating myself in front of her, or saying the wrong thing. Im now stuck wishing I never said that cause Ive been on an emotional roller coaster since then and I hate roller coasters. She replied saying that she would rather we talk about it in person because shes not good at expressing herself through messages and that she didn't want any misunderstandings to happen. This kind of already let me down but I still had hope. She said I could meet her the next day to talk but when I asked what time I should stop by her place she never answered. I didn't want to push it so okay I waited. She calls me Saturday night, at around midnight, three times. I started panicking cause I thought she was calling me to finally give me an answer. I answered on the third ring and even though I was nervous I was just dying to hear an answer. Whatever hope I had in that moment was completely crushed after I picked up. She was calling me to ask for uber money to get to work the next day. I dont think my jaw has ever dropped so low in my entire life. Two days of radio silence after I tell her how I felt and she calls back to ask for money. I already felt battered at this point but I was like okay, just one more day til I see her at work, we work together idk if I mentioned that. I get into work today and she completely ignores me and acts like Im not there. She said we would talk but she never made an effort. Later in the day though she did come around, made some jokes at my expense which is usual and asked about my day. But she never brought up anything about what I said nor did she signal at all what her answer was, although Im not stupid and I see this clearly isn't going my way. Then while we were leaving she looked me straight in the eye and didn't say goodbye. I feel like I could jump out of my skin. It's not the rejection that hurts the most, it's the carelessness. You ignore me, ask me for money and ignore me some more. The money thing was really trifling. I did honestly think I had a chance cause she was always doing the ""hard to get"" bit. She was always hugging me or playing with my hair or sitting on my lap. Id offer to drive her home and she would decline just to come in the next day and jokingly complain that I let her go home alone on the bus. Maybe she just wanted a fling or someone to have fun with which is understandable. Maybe I catch feelings too quickly.  I genuinely feel like Ive been smeared with shit though. I think Im just feeling sorry for myself right now but the fact that I liked her enough to have been the first girl I ever asked out and she just threw it all back up in my face. Idk what Im gonna do now. I desperately want an answer from her, a simple yes or no would suffice. It feels like Im jumping through hoops. Maybe she is into me and she just likes to play games. Maybe she isn't into me but still likes to play games. Maybe I look like a playground and that made her think she could play in my face. I honestly dont know if I should pry any further. Like should I ask her out for coffee to clear the air. I dont think I can handle the tension of working with her from here on out. Today, it felt like I could slice through the atmosphere with scissors. I feel horrible and restless and sad and I can't get comfortable. I genuinely really liked her and even after how she did me these past couple of days I honestly still do. Im at a loss right now and Im starting to realize why movies always show people drinking away their sorrows after breakups. ",1,1743395555.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Tl;dr They died numb and cold because that’s who they were. 

I’m a relationship coach and I like to read between the lines when it comes to relationships on screen, so Hillary and Paul from the train? Here’s my take.

I’m with you, the way they died absolutely felt like jumping the shark. And yet also the idiocy of the way they died made sense to me, based on how Hillary and Paul were first introduced. 

Their first conversation on the train really stuck with me, for some reason. I rewatched the scenes with them and something clicked: from their very first moment on screen, the story is telling us exactly who they are. They’re not really the charming, heart eye emoji, curious couple we meet in their home later. On the train, they are bored. Bored with life, bored with each other, and deeply unimpressed with the world around them.

That opening moment on the train? The stale biscuit cookie conversation at dinner. Hillary talking down about Americans. So bored the next morning, Paul is literally reading yesterday’s news. Hillary’s pestering him about some story, trying to get a reaction, and it’s just… flat. They’re coming back from vacation, and even in transit, they’re unimpressed and disengaged. He’s unimpressed by her and she’s starving for attention. They’re the kind of couple who think they’ve seen it all, but mostly, they’ve just grown numb. Numb to each other mostly and their superior attitude reads as cold to those around them. Numb and cold. 

They look down on other people. There’s a smugness in the way they carry themselves. They think everyone else is naïve. Americans, especially. Then Alex enters, and for a second, it’s like they’re plugged back into something for a bit. Paul is amused by her, a bit impressed. Hillary is as well, likely for different reasons. 

[Side bar: Paul lied to the cops, he did not move to help Alex at all during that awful scene while Alex pours the coffee. In fact, he didn’t even stand up until a few blows in!]

Even walking into the station, Hillary and Paul weren’t walking together or engaging with each other. She stopped to check on Alex. He came back and said come on let’s go. Then his offer to help. They all could have had a lovely spring together if they’d kept the party in Chicago! 

But this boring couple came to life hearing Alex and Spencer’s tale. It was like Act 2 and a total shift. They didn’t even hear the full story, just the part up until the boat, and they were breathless about it. It’s like Alex accidentally becomes the main character in their otherwise dull narrative. 

And Alex? She was tired. Tired of choosing. Tired of the constant fear. Tired of the weight of her own life plus the baby plus the love story. And here were these two people, fascinated with her, impressed by her, giving her a break from being the one steering the wheel. After a whole season of her getting tortured essentially, this was the first moment she could let her guard down a little.

The horrible packing choices and lack of foresight and the gas station moment; all of that makes sense to me when I consider the couple we met on the train. Hillary could have heard what the attendant said, but she didn’t care. She dismissed it. Because of course, they’re not the kind of people who think they need to listen. 

Which is why it makes so much sense that Hillary and Paul died the way they did. Because that’s exactly who they were. Numb and cold to the world around them and to each other. They were the naive ones, truly. They weren’t really living in reality, just so excited to be feeling something again. ",14,1743395478.0,1923Series,8,0.86,False

Looking out into the bustling street in front of her, just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new Grace’ 

A green eyed brown haired girl setting there gripping the handle bars on her bike, for the street just in front of her was long all downhill race for her.

Not really knowing how or why she was here, in a way that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, she only knew where she was at the moment!only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! 

Even though all of this still felt very new to her! The surroundings! The people! Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here! That she had always been here.

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town with a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that she would ride her bike through towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling free from the world around her feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. Racing as the excitement showed in her smile saying it all. Making her through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed by.

With Grace having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Grace! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety.  For Grace was just your typical young green eyed girl who liked her shredded jeans tee shirt and hoodie living her life her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Grace being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge, found herself racing through the streets along with one or two others.

Not to say that one didn’t catch her eye from time to time his name was Hector’ Hector was a guy that charm on a dime. A Latino Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match especially on a bike. Often calling out to Grace saying 

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Grace’ whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them.

Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it,

Knowing that Grace was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Grace leaving him with a glance and a smile as Grace left him looking. 

Just way the way he liked it! Always watching out for her.

While Grace’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different! 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. 

With each day bringing something new to her! A new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself on a bike, Grace would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city.

Telling Grace about his own street races, with Grace always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go forever dodging in and out of front of cars. As always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life. More than often finding herself thinking about her life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail! Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts! Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts! It was as if they belonged to someone else.

It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. Often finding herself dreaming of a life being on her own making her  own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular walked in to set down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. Oddly enough his name was Joe’ an older retired gentleman, A regular that Grace came know from their talks at the coffee shop.

Joe would often tell Grace about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for many great nights he had here in the mountains around us when he was younger.

Grace always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Joe would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where I wanted to be buried.

That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen! That in the end that this was his home! This was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Grace would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Grace for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget.

To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. 

Or on one of the many trails on the outskirts of town, Grace found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go,

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light.

Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by.

Some she knew, while others being new to the area! Standing there thinking if any of these people could be who they are! Could they be of someone else from somewhere else!

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Grace that was her Life! Being on her bike loose and fast! Racing with the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Grace had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Grace and Hector to a race, but not just any race a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Grace and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. 

Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Grace then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Grace are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Grace’s! All I know is how I feel about the Grace that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Grace giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Grace before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you ether laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Grace that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead.

But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Grace and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. 

The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Grace trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Grace then stopping to check as Hector then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Grace! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Grace had caught up to them, for Grace knew the trails like no other. 

Racing hard and fast to the finish side by side! Just as Grace then a hard look and smile to the outsider as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail! Leaving him setting there as Grace had won the race.

Later that evening Grace and Hector would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Grace just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector then saying goodbye to Grace as he then headed back to town leaving Grace there for the night.

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Grace had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she lived From the town that she lived in. But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light putting her hands up to her head Grace just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this Chloe? And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Grace began to scream a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “Hello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

“Then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Grace then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Grace your dreams.” 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Grace and it is not you”

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Grace then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Grace. 

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now it was her town her home her Life. With Grace now leaving Angels Ravine making her way home, but as usual finding her  self racing to beat her own best time.

Grace was now making her way in Life, through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was going to ride into Life into her Life Living a Life of what she made it.

Because of this, while we usually would see each other for several hours during our weekly dates and get all dressed up to go to a nearby city (like around 5 hours together), we have only been able to get coffee together for about an hour or two just to see each other. Also, even though this wasn’t an issue in the past, he’s been having longer hours at work that have been having him attend much earlier, so when I see him he’s either tired, or has to go to bed soon, which also has made our hangouts a little less “enjoyable”.

Despite this, we call often (around a couple times a week) and text each other nearly every hour of the day, so I’d say our communication makes up for this busy time. He’s really good at keeping me updated throughout the day. 

However, yesterday when we saw each other, something rubbed me the wrong way. So we got milkshakes together, and as we’re sitting I can tell he’s just really tired. And although I was enjoying our time together, idk, I just had this nagging feeling that I wasn’t being exciting enough or something (may be my anxiety, may be the actual truth, idk). But we spend a couple hours together, he’s being a gentlemen as always (he’s really good at this too), and he was also the one to ask to see me (because I was holding off on being the one to ask him if he was free just to “test my theory”), but usually he’s the one to ask anyways. 

ANYWAYS, eventually it’s getting late and time for me to go home, and he also just looks exhausted, so I’m thinking it’s time to call it a night for both of us. I go home, he texts me how nice it was to see me (I was also waiting for him to do this first) and I’m pretty content. 

Then about an hour after we both go home, he texts me that he’s heading to grab some food with his friends, and at this point it’s pretty late. Now, maybe I’m being dramatic. But the way he looked when I saw him, he looked exhausted. So I’m just wondering, was I just that boring?? Like idk, something about him seemingly not having the energy to spend time with me, but then heading out an after he got home to go see his friends, just made me feel not the greatest. 

I texted him to have fun though, and fell asleep just a bit sad, and I woke up the next day to his good morning and him texting me that he got home. 

I’ve sort of brought up this issue to him before, as there was one week I was back and didn’t see him as much as I could’ve hoped, and told him that I was a little sad about that, and had a feeling he was getting bored of me. He heavily denied this, but I don’t know, I just can’t shake off this feeling. On my end, I feel like nothings really wrong, he treats me right, communicates, and is just great—when I actually get to spend TIME with him. 

Another thing that has me worried, is we used to be a bit more intimate with each other, we’re both virgins, but you know, just do a bit more. But, we had a talk around 2 months ago (he brought it up) about wanting to tone it down a little and “save it” so we don’t go too far. Now this might come off as a red flag, but we’re Arab, and honeslty most of our culture is really strict, so I get this worry that he has of moving too fast, and although it may not make sense to some of you, the reason I’m bringing this up is for the next point: sometimes I can’t tell that him not kissing me or cuddling me as much is because of him trying to wait and restrain, or if he’s just not as attracted to me. On the one hand, he compliments me a lot, and really does make me feel beautiful. On the other, sometimes I just can’t shake off this feeling that something’s wrong. 

I don’t know. I’ve talked about it with him before, and asked him if he truly loves me, if he sees a future with me, if there’s anything wrong, etc. all of which he’s denied and attempted to make me feel better. But I just still have this urge to ASK but I don’t want to just constantly bring up this negativity and make him feel like what he’s doing or the love he’s shown me is not “good enough” or makes me feel loved enough. It’s just been a tough time and I can’t tell if I’m overthinking or if anything’s wrong. He promises that the next month will be better (we’ll both be out of school, and have month off until we start working), but I’m just struggling with this right now. 

Please let me know if I’m over thinking (I will genuinely take that as an answer) or if you see that something else might be wrong. ",1,1743394915.0,u_anonymouspurple23,0,1.0,False

Lying there in my Bed as the days first light began making its way through the bedroom window looking at me. Telling me that a new day was upon me! Saying to me that the day is ready for you.

Trying to tell me in its way, that there was a place in this life for you! Setting up in bed there looking out of the window to a another day laying there asking myself 

“What has life got to give me today? Is there even a place here in life for me?”

With me not knowing then, that later on I would realize that there is a place in this life for me! But leaving me asking the question why isn’t there a place in life for everyone!

Thinking to myself seeing the sun as its light glimmered through and around the trees branches just outside of my window as the wind blew through its leaves. As if the sun was trying to tell me something as if it was trying to tell me that today was going to be different. 

But just as that thought left me the quietness of the morning was being overridden with the sound of the neighborhood kids.  Walking by my window making their way to a nearby school seeing and hearing that the early morning sounds was not going away anytime soon. Not really wanting to get out of bed to what would be just another day for me.

 But slowly as I made my way up and out of bed making my to bathroom standing there in front of the mirror looking at myself. Looking a not so feeling to young Girl closing in on 30! Standing there running my hand back through my messed up blonde hair. Thinking to myself standing there looking into the mirror thinking to myself 

“What could a blue eyed girl do to get through yet another day.”

 Another day of let’s see if I can get through this day without questioning myself or Life in itself standing there in the bathroom putting my clothes on asking myself 

“ Do I really want to do this?Do I really want this day to even be here” 

Making my way into the kitchen turning on the coffee maker! Not really knowing where to even begin until I have had my mornings coffee. Setting down at the kitchen table to the mornings newspaper along with my coffee. Setting there flipping through the pages of the morning newspaper looking at what else the world may have to look forward to. Throwing the newspaper to the side thinking to myself 

“ is there anything left in this Life, was there any faith left in me at all.”

Knowing that this day was already going to be hard enough as it was Just before grabbing my things before heading out the door. I noticed my coat was still hanging in the closet dropping my purse back onto the kitchen table. Saying to myself 

“My head would still in the bed asleep it if we’re not attached to me” 

Doing a complete 180 making my way back into my room opening up my closet door reaching for it screaming 

“Oh my God! Now where in the hell is it!”

And that was when I noticed a box setting there in the corner out of curiosity I reached for grabbing it out of the closet thinking to myself what was in it. 

Walking back into the kitchen placing it down onto the kitchen table not knowing of what I would find in it. Setting down to open it up to find Memories! Memories that would bring me to rediscovering the past in my life. A past that would bring me to finding something that was missing from my life. 

 I just didn’t realize it at the moment! It was a scrap book along with photos and a letter, with one of the photos being of my mom setting there looking at the photo of my mom not always being very close to her it would still bring a tear.

But It didn’t seem make my day any better at the moment for today marks ten years since she had passed away. And with me going to visit her grave today it did not make it easier seeing this photo here picking up another photo the memories of yesterday hit me hard as I looked into the photo. Looking at a younger me a young Girl of about twelve years of age with my short brown hair standing there next to my mother.

 Who was next to identical to me and setting there beside me was my dog, a dog who I named Buddy. Thinking back I remembered the good times that I had with my dog buddy! But not all of it was good times! But for most teens you just don’t realize how much you would miss your parents till they are gone.

And that was when I found the letter, a letter that I have not seen before today thinking to myself that reading it that it would not make my day any easier. But read it I did, for the letter read as this, 

“. To my lovely Daughter Dakota’ I am writing this letter to you! For when you get older you will realize the hard times and the good times that we had together.”

“For no matter what you will always be my beautiful little girl my little Dakota! knowing that the last few years that we had together was not the best for either of us. But I always had faith that you would someday see for yourself”

“That no matter what happens in this world that the ones that you love will someday leave you in this Life. 
Leaving you with their memories, so I want you to think back on the time that you ran away from home. Think back on what you found, think back back to what you have seemed to have lost along the way. For as you read this letter that I have written to you I want you to think back on the summer that you found, on what Life brought to you that summer just before your teenage Life was to begin. For then when you find it again you know that as your mother a place I have found a place that i hope you will find too. Knowing that the people you met along the way that summer for in your heart you will know. That there is a place in Heaven for us.”

Reading that sent my mind racing, racing back to that day thinking on everything that the day would bring back to me. But little did I know that the day would bring something! And in a way it that I would have never knew for someone it would bring me to that day.

Remembering back It was early that morning when I got up not wanting to get out bed just as my dog buddy would come running.  Jumping up onto my bed licking my face making himself known in his way telling me in his way. Only the way that my little buddy could do! Letting me know that another day was here another day
to go exploring. to find ourselves wondering out into a world of that only our imagination could.

Giving buddy a hug rubbing his fur as I got out of bed walking into the kitchen as my mom was making breakfast. Setting down at the table as she asked me what I wanted to eat looking at her saying 

“ maybe later I’m not hungry right now” 

for I was still thinking about the argument that we had the night before. But before I could say anything my mom spoke to me saying 

“Honey I know that you are getting older but I am still your mother! You may not want to hear that right now but I just want to be able to talk to you Dakota! and that one day you will appreciate the Life that I am trying to give you!” 

jumping up from my chair looking to my mom as I shouted to her saying 

“ look mom not now I just want to just go! So look I will be back later” 

Making my way out the door as looking back at my mom saying 

“ look I will be back later till then just chilling okay!” 

Walking out the door with buddy following me. Years later I would look back with regret on not giving more respect to my mother then.

 But now a journey awaited me a journey that would in time change my Life forever, forever in a way that I would soon find. Setting there on the back steps with buddy by my side looking out across our farm. I thought to myself

 “what else is out there? What else was there for me in this life.”

 Looking down at buddy saying to him 

“ let’s go find out for ourselves what else is out there for us! For it can not be any worse for us then it is here” 

With that I stood up saying to buddy

 “ let’s go! Let’s see for ourselves what else is out there” 

walking across the field of our farm making our way to the fence line. I thought to myself once I do this there is no turning back! There is only the road ahead of us! Jumping the fence me and buddy made our way to the road with my house now out of sight I knew now. That we was on our way and that we was also on our own! To where I did not know but we would find out when got there! 

As we walked down the dirt road a ways not meeting any cars till we came to the gas station at the end of the road. Seeing a red farm truck parked on the side of the gas station quickly grabbing buddy running up to the truck climbing onto the tailgate. 

 Laying down inside the back of the pickup me and buddy laid there in the back off the pickup truck noticing a blanket in the corner. Quickly grabbing it before anyone would come over covering myself and buddy up laying there it was not long till I heard the owner getting into the truck not noticing us. With him then Pulling out of the gas as I then looked to buddy saying

“Woohoo we are on our way now!”

Feeling as the wind as it hit up against the blanket laying there as we made our way down the road. About fifteen minutes later uncovering ourselves setting up looking out into the empty fields as we  passed by them. Feeling the freedom of the wind making our way down the road. At the same time making sure that the driver didn’t see us.  Looking down at buddy I could see him looking up at me as if he was saying what are you doing. Saying with a smile saying to him 

“ I know what you would say if you could talk but I know what I am doing “ 

looking back out into the opened fields as we continued to drive farther down the road. I thought to myself

“what was I going to do when I got there? Where was I going to go?” 

About thirty more minutes had passed by with the driver still not noticing us pulling into the parking lot of the grocery store. Quickly laying back down covering myself and buddy back up! Laying there waiting hearing the truck door open as a person then got out. Upon hearing the truck door shut waiting a couple of minutes to make sure that everything was clear. Looking all around before uncovering myself and buddy before making our way from the truck not looking back until we were far enough away. 

Looking out across the parking lot I recognized the grocery store that my mom would bring me when we went shopping.

 Walking from the parking lot myself and buddy found ourselves walking down the sidewalk as people would pass us by. Not paying any real attention to them we just kept walking keeping to ourselves until we then came across a gentleman. He was setting there on a bench in front of a the convenient store whittling away on a piece of wood. Just as he then Look up at me saying 

“Well hello there! My that is pretty little dog that you have there with you” 

Saying back to him 

“Thank you! His name is buddy! my mom got me from the pound” 

Smiling back to me he then asked me saying 

“So where are you and buddy headed too on this fine day here if I may ask”

Replying back to him I said to him 

“Just seeing what a girl and her dog could find on our way! On our adventure finding out what life has for us”

Looking suspiciously at me and buddy he then said to us 

“ finding yourself on an adventure! Why aren’t you a little young to be out here looking to what Life has to offer you”? 

“Maybe there is someone looking for you, maybe you should reconsider what it is that you are looking for and then when are old enough you then can”

“Then maybe you can see what Life is about, but for now just wait here a moment I will be right back.” 

As he then walked into the convenient store a couple of minutes later coming back out carrying a drink and bag of chips along with a couple of dog treats. As he then handed them to me saying 

“ Look I want you to promise me that you will go home now today! And think about your Life! And sleep on it and when you get up in the morning you just might know that the Life that you have right now. Is the best time, the best memories that you will know! For when you become an adult you may think that Life is grand and that you are on your way! “

“But know this little one the memories that you make as a child are memories that keep you going when Life steps in letting you know that there is someone that still loves you in the memories that you keep.“ 

thanking the kind gentleman as me and buddy then made our way down the street I didn’t know then what he said as I would later in my Life what he meant.

As the evening was about to set in as buddy and myself walked down the road making our way out of town out of sight. We came upon a field making our way across the field as the sun began to set on us we decided to make camp there for the night Just. Having no tent only the stars above us as our cover us as laying there under the stars with buddy curled up next to me. 

Thinking to myself about my mom was she missing me? What was she doing? As I laid there thinking to myself where was I going to go? What was I going to do when I got there? As laid there looking up into a Star lit sky thinking to myself what else was out there? What else did Life have to offer me. 

Soon finding myself falling to sleep asking myself certain things till I would fall to sleep for that night dreaming of myself and buddy being back at the farm. Dreaming of the man that we had met earlier that day as he was telling me in my Dream. 

“ You may not know of your Life right now! But somewhere someone out there has a plan for you in Life”.

 “For everyone that you meet in Life will forever stay with you whether it is in your Dreams or memories. You will know that there is a place for you in this Life” 

As I then Dreamed I then Dreamed of mom. In my dream she was crying, crying for me saying to me 

“ please Dakota come home wherever you are please come back to me” 

Waking up the next morning with a tear in my eye I made a decision, a decision that would lead me to a place, a place that would change my Life forever.

With me and buddy making our way across the field thinking about the journey ahead the journey would take us to where we were going. Only problem was that we had no idea on where that was! We only knew that we were on our way!  Spending most of the day keeping  in the field Till we then came upon a truck parked on the side of the road looking around I could see a individual standing in a field across the road standing in another field. He was just standing there not really knowing on why he was just standing there at the moment.

Thinking to myself we could sneak another ride to somewhere as we did before, quickly running up too the truck climbing over the tailgate and laying down before the individual saw us. It wasn’t maybe about five minutes had passed before hearing the truck door open with someone getting in closing the door. Laying there as the truck started up thinking to myself that whoever it was did not see us as we then pulled onto the road making our way to wherever we was going. Laying there in the bed of the pickup with buddy to my side thinking to myself as laid there watching the clouds in sky pass by as we made our way down the road. 

I thought to myself what was I going to do when I got there? Would I ever see myself going back home again? But whatever would happen I knew that somewhere down the road I would find my place in Life. A place that I knew I belonged there but till then I laid there with buddy by my side looking up at the sky as it passed by I looked to buddy saying 

“We are on our way buddy you and I, for we will find our place in this Life you me and me together we will find our place in this Life.”

As the day went by further down the road finding ourselves laying in the bed of the pickup I could see the nights sky coming into view. Just as we made our way down the highway thirsty and hungry I felt lying there in the bed of pickup. For I did not know when or where we would end up at looking up at the stars as we passed by I found myself falling to sleep in the bed of the pickup as we made our way down the road.

 I found myself Dreaming yet again this time I was standing there looking out of a window looking into out into a world. A world that I was not for sure off a world that seemed distant to me a world that in time I would come to know. As I continued to look out the window I found myself looking at the tree outside of my window the leaves had all but fallen off on to the ground. A cold breeze would make its way through it branches making its way to me as I stood there looking at my mom waving to me from as she stood there looking at me. As she then turned and walked away as I screamed into glass of the window to my mom saying to her.

“Wait mom please come back please where are you going “ 

Turning back to me with a smile looking to me saying 

“ I love you Dakota! I love you wherever your are” 

With that I suddenly thought to myself with tears in my eyes thinking to myself 

“What have I done? What have I done to my mom?”

Just as I then suddenly woke up realizing that I was still in the bed in the back off the pickup feeling the truck pulling in somewhere before coming to a stop. Lying there hearing the truck door open up I laid there with buddy waiting for the right moment before getting up. 

But before I could say anything I suddenly heard a voice, a voice of needless to say a very surprised man saying to me 

“What in Gods name! I can’t even believe to what I am seeing!”

Looking at me with a very stunned with a  surprised look on his face. But before I could even say anything he just looked at me saying

 “You have got a lot of explaining to do but first come with me inside so I can find out where you came from and we can go from there” 

Climbing down from the bed of the pickup me and buddy made our way inside the mans house where he then proceeded to call the local authorities. Knowing that my and buddies journey had came to an end! Just as he ask me if I was hungry if wanted something to eat not turning down a good meal I immediately said to him

“yes very much so”

 After me and buddy ate I then explained to the man my story telling him everything before the local authorities would arrive. But then I heard a voice I heard a voice of what sounded to be a little boy in the next room calling out for his dad. As the man was standing there in his kitchen talking to what seemed to be his wife. Walking over to the room looking in as looked in I saw a boy about the same age as me lying there in bed looking at him  saying 

“Hello“

Looking to me with a surprise the boy then said to me 

“Who are you” 

I replied to him saying 

“ I am Dakota and what is your name” 

As he then spoke bake to me saying 

“My name is Billy” 

Walking closer o him I could see that he was sick he had a tube attached to his arm that was attached to a fluid bag next to him. Standing there next to him asking him if everything was all right he replied to me saying 

“The Doctors told my mom and dad that I had cancer and that it may take awhile for me to get better” 

Just as I was talking to him buddy then came running into the room jumping up onto the bed next to Billy. As I told buddy to get down billy then said with a smile 

“ its okay I like dogs so his name is buddy?” 

Replying to him saying yes that his name was buddy and that we sort of found ourselves on a little journey. Looking at me with a smile as billy then said to me 

“A journey! 

“Man I would love to go on a journey someday a journey to where I could find myself somewhere other then here in this bed” 

Looking to Billy I said to him 

“Maybe one day you will find yourself self on a journey, maybe you me and buddy could go on a journey together”

Smiling to me saying 

“Man that would be great going on a journey”

“I would love nothing but to find myself on an adventure one day!”

With Billy just looking at me as he then looked down at buddy petting him as he smiled. He then looked up to me from his bed saying to me 

“ I want to so bad to find my place in this Life!  I want to just get up from here and go live my Life.”

“But hearing it in my mom and dad’s voice I can hear it that I may not get any better. And all I can do is think to myself maybe if not here in this Life then maybe in another Life I then can find my place in Life”

Just then as his dad would come into his room looking at me saying to me that it was time, time for me to head home. Looking back to Billy before I left saying to him 

“ I hope that one day that you will get better and just maybe one day when you get to feeling better I will come visit you again and we can go on an adventure together” 

As Billy then gave buddy one last hug looking at him smiling petting him one last time before we made my our way to front door. To where the authorities were waiting there to take me and buddy back home.

 As we made our way back home from our little journey pulling into the drive way back at our farm I could see my mom come running out to me as I got out of the car. Grabbing me hugging me crying saying to me 

“Don’t you ever leave me again Dakota! Don’t you ever leave like that again me again” 

hugging my mom saying to her

 “I promise mom I will never leave you again” 

For as the days went on I would set there thinking about billy and Journey that me and buddy went on that day. Thinking to myself settling there on the front porch with buddy setting there beside me. Looking out into the opened field in front of me Just as my mom would come out on the front porch setting down next me. As placed her arms around me with tears in her eyes 

 Telling me that the boy that I had met on my journey Billy! That Billy had passed away this morning! With tears in my eyes setting there leaning up against my mom not knowing of what to think. Saying to my mom

“Why! Billy’ can’t die! He was going to get better so me him and buddy could go on a journey together”

Just knowing that setting there with my mom giving me a hug saying to me 

“Honey I know that they are things in this Life that are hard to understand. And that as we go through Life we still find ourselves still asking ourselves that from Time to time.” 

For the rest of that evening me and my mom would set there on the front porch talking to one another about what life means for us as we grow up. With that being one of the few times that we did talk with one another, for it was not until I got older that then that I would realize on how much my mom meant to me.

Looking back now thinking to myself setting there in the kitchen holding my mom’s letter that she had written to me knowing now that it would be a letter for me to read later in my life A letter for me to look back upon.

 Thinking of the gentleman that I had met on my journey with buddy and that he was right when he told me that the memories that we make during our childhood Sometimes help us get through our Life as adults today. 

And on that day as I stood there at my mom’s grave I thought to myself thinking of my mom! Thinking about Billy’ so many years ago what he said to me! For there was a place for him in this life and for the little time that he had in Life here, he indeed had a place, a place where he lived in his mom and dads memories and in their hearts. For the little time that I knew him I always thought of him in Life and in memories that he left behind for me. 

For me to grow to appreciate the Life that I had, For there was also another place for him. A place for my mom, a place that someday I would also find myself at. There was a place!
A Place In Heaven
