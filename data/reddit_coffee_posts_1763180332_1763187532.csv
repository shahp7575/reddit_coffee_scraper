So as the title states I want to know if this could be an effective way to study when tired! So I went to class today came home had coffee than worked an 8 hour shift. Came back home cooked supper.

 I have an exam for my lab in 1 week and an exam for my lectures in another 3!

Once i came home i studied my lab and tried the teacher method along with some images after I revied multiple choice questions I made of my lectures for about an hour to a half an hour.

 I feel like i want to study more as I have the time now but I am soo tired and I can tell it's not doing anything in terms of being able to remember stuff i should know/maintaining information. This makes me think I don't remember the info as much as I should! Will watching videos be a good idea as its easier on the brain?",1,1763187465.0,GetStudying,0,1.0,False

I, 30F, have been going to bed at least 30 minutes after my husband (30M). 
Not on purpose, mind you, this just always seems to happen.

You see, I am a sahm. We have 3 kids (1yr-5yr), and 2 dogs and 2 cats.   
Before going to bed, I am always, ALWAYS, the one who has to let the dogs outside to do their last potty break of the night before plugging in their invisible fence collars. And then i have to turn off all the lights and sometimes prep coffee, depending on how early my husband needs to get up for work. 

My baby always seems to wake up by the time my husband or i get upstairs.

So then, I have to nurse the baby, adding another 10-15 minutes to the nighttime routine. And, most of these nights, I hadn't had a chance to ACTUALLY GET READY FOR BED MYSELF.

Also also: my 1 year old has entered a sleep regression stage. So getting him to go back to sleep after a feed is a pain in my already tired butt.

Tonight, my German Shepherd, that I didn't want in the first place, he is my husband's dog, chased one of our cats down the stairs causing drums drums drums in the deep. Thus waking the baby, so I had to feed him. It was 10:30PM.
I feed the baby and tried putting him back to bed. Nope. He was awake. Not done nursing.
So I nursed him some more. My 2 year old rolled over in his sleep and nearly fell out of his bed, waking himself up. 

I tried shushing him and got him some milk. He cried very loudly and woke the baby, who I had just gotten to sleep. I was frazzled, to say the least and muttered for him to shut up, purely out of exhausted emotion. I corrected myself by whispering sweetly that I got him his milk and tucked him in. He began to doze but now my baby is very awake. 

My husband grumbled at me that I always do this and that I should go to bed earlier. Like that is the ultimate solution. If I go to bed before him, I know he will not plug in the dogs collars or turn off the lights. Because of past experiences. I snapped at him and told him his commentary was not warranted nor wanted. 

Was I/have i been the a-hole here? There are things I could do earlier, I'll admit.",1,1763187082.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

1oxk9ke,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1oxk9ke/tooth_pain_while_eatingdrinking_is_now_randomly/,tooth pain while eating/drinking is now randomly flaring up after treatment/filling,"No pic because I don't have the image my dentist took and my teeth look normal (if a bit yellow) from the outside.

I went to a dentist recently for the first time as an adult. I had four cavities and pain in one tooth (the biggest cavity) that had me drinking through a straw. She gave me a filling but said it might ultimately need a root canal - she showed me the image and the cavity was just reaching or grazing the border of the nerve, well into the second layer.

But she gave me a filling, told me to use Sensodyne, and 95% of the pain went away.

Thing is (and I did ask her at the checkup), I don't understand why I'm still getting random tooth pain while eating/drinking, and it's now been over a month since getting the filling. I can be eating or drinking and then out of nowhere a burst of pain. If the cavity is filled and the nerve isn't exposed anymore, I don't understand how food or fluids (it seems to be triggered more by fluids or wet food) are agitating it.

I asked her and she said it'd probably be best to leave it rather than do anything invasive if it's not ruining my quality of life. She said there might be short term pain due to a buildup of gas. But it's been over a month and I'm still getting it, on and off.

Should I look for a second opinion or book yet another appointment/checkup? It seemed like she didn't really know why it was hurting and there wasn't anything more she could do unless it got bad enough for a root canal.

I just wanna know if there's some aspect of oral health I'm missing, or if I should generally be worried about the tooth's health now that it's filled.

I drink coffee and water, I don't drink alcohol or smoke or do drugs. I'm getting on top of brushing and flossing after every meal now but I neglected it for a long time growing up (hence lots of small fillings).

She also said I have slightly receded gums on the off chance that's somehow relevant.

Thank you very much if you can advise as to whether I should worry : )

1oxk8uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oxk8uc/which_carpet_cleaner_is_easiest_to_use/,Which carpet cleaner is easiest to use?,"Look, I've been dealing with carpet stains for years, and I'm not gonna lie – most carpet cleaners are a pain to deal with. Between the heavy machines, complicated attachments, and confusing instructions, it feels like you need an engineering degree just to clean up some spilled coffee.

But after trying way too many of these things, I finally figured out what actually makes a carpet cleaner easy to use.

**Weight Actually Matters**

The easiest carpet cleaners to use are the ones you can actually carry around without throwing out your back. I learned this the hard way after lugging a 20-pound monster up and down my stairs. Now I always check the weight before buying anything.

Lightweight portable carpet cleaners are perfect if you've got multiple floors or just want something that won't sit in your closet because it's too annoying to pull out.

**Simple Is Better**

Here's the thing – you don't need a carpet cleaner with fifteen different settings and attachments. The best ones have like two buttons: on and off. Maybe a spray trigger. That's it.

I put together a list of [carpet cleaners that are actually user-friendly](https://goodhomedeals.com/carpet-cleaner) so you don't have to waste time reading through hundreds of reviews like I did.

**Easy to Fill and Empty**

Nobody talks about this enough, but filling and emptying the tanks is where most carpet cleaners become a nightmare. The good ones have tanks you can remove without tools, fill at any sink, and empty without spilling dirty water everywhere.

Clear tanks are also clutch because you can see when the dirty water tank is full instead of guessing.

**Quick Heat-Up Time**

Some carpet cleaning machines take forever to heat up the water. The easy-to-use models either heat up fast or don't need heating at all. Because honestly, when you've got a fresh stain, you want to tackle it right away, not wait around for ten minutes.

**My Recommendation**

After testing a bunch of different models, I found that handheld spot cleaners and compact upright cleaners are the easiest for most people. They're light enough to move around, simple enough that anyone can figure them out, and they actually work.

If you want to skip all the research I did, check out [these top-rated easy-to-use carpet cleaners](https://goodhomedeals.com/carpet-cleaner). They're sorted by ease of use, so you can pick what works best for your situation.

The bottom line is this: the easiest carpet cleaner to use is the one you'll actually pull out and use when you need it. Don't overthink it, and definitely don't buy something super complicated just because it has more features. Keep it simple, keep it light, and you'll be fine.",1,1763187006.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

1oxk7vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABirdslife/comments/1oxk7vu/dad_continued/,Dad - continued,"I loved my dad, he was my hero. I remember having my little suitcase packed, my coat on, waiting on the sidewalk in front of the house. Waiting for him to come pick me up. I would be so excited. I would wait, and wait, and wait. It would get later, and later, and later. By dark Mom would come out, pick up my suitcase, and say it's time to come inside. Which usually resulted in her having to carry me inside along with the suitcase. I would cry and blame her. Asking her what she did to make him not come.

She said it didn't take her long to stop. She stopped telling me he was coming, even if he said he was. She stopped packing the suitcase and just let it be a surprise if he actually did show up. She said she never knew what to say when I asked why he didn't come. Or when I asked why he didn't want to see me. Or when I asked her why he didn't love me.

He didn't show up often, very rarely actually. I can say that I have 3 memories of visiting him while he was in jail. My aunt Paula took me to see him. I remember sitting in the little booth with the window and having to talk to him through the phone. I never really thought of them as traumatizing but it must of been. Cause I remember them.

When I was 7 years old, my dad took me to the state fair. A friend of my dad picked us up from my grandma Isabel's and dropped us at the fair grounds. On the way, my dad handed his friend a baggie of white powder, which I now know was either coke or meth. His friend asked if it was any good, my dad responded stick it up your nose and find out. 

We didn't stay at the fair long. A couple rides, a couple games, and several beers later my dad was ready to go. Same friend picked us up but instead of going back to my grandma's house we went to the friend's house. My dad told my grandma that I wanted to stay the night there and play with his friend's kids. I don't remember the rest of the afternoon or evening. The friend's girlfriend was nice and I slept the spare room. I remember waking up and having to use the bathroom, seeing my dad and his friend in the living room doing lines on the coffee table, and then going back to bed. I remember waking up the next morning and finding my dad on the floor next to the bed laying in his own vomit. I remember waking up the girlfriend and telling her my dad was sick. I remember her taking me to the kitchen to get breakfast and watch cartoons. Then Grandma Isabel was picking me up. 

I never told my mom. To this day she doesn't know. I did tell my grandma Isabel several months later. Immediately after I told her, she very seriously said, ""Mi hija, if your dad is here or shows up and tries to get you to go with him, you come and find me. You make sure to come and tell me before you leave with him. I mean it mi hija, you come and tell me. If you don't we might never see you again. Your dad is going to take you and disappear. You understand?"" 

This had the effect she intended and probably saved me from being kidnapped a second time. He did try to get me to go with him another time. I was visiting her for the weekend and when we got to her house my dad was there. He had broken into her house and was sleeping on the floor. Grandma said I could go outside and play until dinner was done but I had to stay in front where she could see me out the window. My dad came out with me for awhile, when a car pulled up. Dad asked me if I wanted to ride to the store with him. I said I need to tell Grandma Isabel. He said we would be right back I didn't need to tell her. I insisted. He started to get mad, told me that he was my father and he said i could go. I headed for the front door repeating I needed to ask. He said he wasn't waiting and stormed off. He didn't come back. I didn't see him again until I was 12.

a few days  ago I made a post here asking *“What can I do as a content creator to tell Myanmar’s story in the right way?”*  
(If you haven’t seen it: it’s basically about my approach to documentary-style storytelling and my concerns about entering the country respectfully.)

Since then, things have become a bit clearer for me: I’ve decided to fly into Yangon. It’s the only realistic way for me to enter, and after a lot of thinking and discussion, I still feel that telling human stories from Myanmar is something worth pursuing - **if it’s done carefully, safely, and with the consent of everyone involved.**

I’m not a war journalist, and I’m not coming in as someone wanting a vaction. I’m somewhere in the small space in between: someone who tries to make the realities of a place understandable for a Western audience without exploiting them.  
I want to show that Myanmar exists, that its people exist, and that what’s happening there shouldn’t be forgotten.

**What I’m looking for now:**

* people in Yangon who are open to sharing their experiences,
* locals who might point me to meaningful stories,
* anyone who can help me understand what is *appropriate* to document and what is not,
* and clear guidance on what to completely avoid for everyone’s safety.

I will **never show anyone on camera without explicit permission**, and my priority is to avoid putting anyone at risk.. especially in a place where attention can be dangerous.

I don’t expect (or even want) activism or political statements. I’m simply trying to listen, learn, and portray daily life, resilience, and the human side of Myanmar in a way that is fair and respectful.

If anyone in Yangon is willing to talk, share a coffee, exchange thoughts, or just point me in the right direction, I’d really appreciate it :)  
  
Feel free to DM me if that feels safer.

Its going great, and the people are lovely, but I'm finding it difficult to engage in genuine interactions outside of small talk. Yesterday I considered downloading a dating app and trying that out. And then this morning when I went out for coffee, a Chinese woman came up to me and started reeeeaaally crushing on me. I haven't experienced a woman being this direct with me in well over a year or two. It was flattering, but it really threw me off guard.

She seemed nice but she made me kinda uncomfortable. She had this thousand yard stare, stood way too close and there was something about her that seemed kinda off. About 5'2, but really intimidating and very, very serious demeanour. I'm Irish, so I like to keep things silly and lighthearted. Maybe it's just a clash of cultures, I'm not sure. I've never been with a Chinese woman before.

We exchanged numbers. She had a QR code ready for me to scan on WhatsApp, and she was not amused that i found that really funny. I told her I have some things to do today but we should meet up tomorrow. As I was walking away, I felt absolutely awful. I started to question if I actually want to meet up with her, and if I did, it would be for my own selfish reason of getting with someone I have no interest in. And then it dawned on me that the only reason I gave her that false optimism in the first place is I don't know how to turn someone down respectfully and I haven't had to do it in years.

I've never been the promiscuous type, but because I'm only going to be in this city for a few more days, I'm kinda wondering if I should give it a shot regardless. She knows I'm leaving soon and still wants to meet up anyway. On one hand, it'd feel like I'm going against my intuition, but on the other hand it feels like the universe saying ""here ya go, buddy; have fun.""

I know exactly how that feels and I tried to ignore it for a long time. Worked more instead. Stayed busier. I tired to fill every single minute with noise, even if it was just a podcast, music or the TV. Then in my early 20s, I ended up in a clinic with severe depression.

And here's the thing, I had friends who called me, even visited. But there was still this insane loneliness. Because I felt like nobody actually understood. Nobody could really feel what I was going through.

Since then, I've been extremely open about depression, about my illness, about all of it. Not for attention. But to show understanding. To help others with that feeling.

So lately I've been thinking a lot about isolation, the loneliness in this industry, in our industry. I wanted to talk about it, address it directly, see how many people actually feel it.

**This specific, suffocating type of loneliness that is more common than one would think.**

You finish a great shift. Good money. Fun conversations. Everything went well… Or it was super bad, empty room, no tips… And the moment you shut down your computer – silence. Heavy silence that takes over everything and suddenly feels so loud it screams at you.

It’s almost weird to feel this way, after speaking to people all day long.

But actually, it's not weird at all. There's even science on it: you can be surrounded by interaction and still be drowning in loneliness because you’re creating an experience for someone else. **No matter** **how you feel inside.** But what protects your mental health isn't how much you talk to people. It's whether you feel connected to something real. To the world. To yourself. Not just performing for others all day.

**Today, I actually enjoy being alone.**

It took work to get here and it wasn't easy but here's what helped me and I hope that it helps some of you too:

1. **I changed the story I told myself.** I started telling myself ""I like being alone. I like watching what I want, cooking what I like."" Even when I didn't feel it yet. I just kept saying it until my brain started believing it.
2. **I created small moments that felt good.** Whenever I had time, even just half a day, I did things I actually enjoy. Went on hikes with my dog. The first time I went to a coffee shop alone? Hard. In fact, super hard – I walked around the café two times before I went in. But the next time was easier. And easier. Until it was normal. I brought a book, read the news, people-watched. Went window shopping. Small things that I enjoy.
3. **I started planning my time, even the simple things.** Structuring my days made solitude feel *chosen*, not accidental. I plan my days now, even if it's just a movie night. I make myself look forward to it.

It's not easy at first. But it gets easier.

Because your brain learns through repetition, emotional exposure, and small proofs of safety. Feeling comfortable alone isn't a personality trait, it's a practiced skill. You teach your mind that solitude isn't a threat. It's a space that can actually feel good.

**Being alone and feeling lonely are two completely different things.**

And I know it's harder in this industry. Most people have coworkers. Someone to vent to about a difficult client. Someone who just gets it.

Working alone all day, every day and night? Whether you have people in your life or not? That's not easy.

**Why this matters?**

Learning to be comfortable alone isn't about giving up on connection. It's about building a foundation so you're not drowning in loneliness while you figure out the rest. Because reconnecting to the world, actually finding people you can be real with, building friendships that aren't based on performance, that takes time. And it's hard. Really hard. But you can't reach out from a place of desperation. You have to start by being okay with yourself, with the quiet. Then you can start building connections that actually feel real.

It starts with you and the silence making peace with each other.

I've been open about my journey because I know what it's like to feel like nobody understands. And I've watched what isolation does when people carry it alone.

    (This is a long one I’m sorry)

Throw away account because I have no idea if any of them have Reddit, and I’m going to put as much detail as I can without making it too obvious. (Also this is my first time posting so bear with me.)
I (23f) am married to my husband (23), and have a son (10mo).
My in-laws (50ish M) (45ish F) and their kid (who’s a minor and I won’t talk about her for that reason). 
I’m going to make up a letter for them and will go as follows: 
Husband: T
FIL: J
MIL: S
I will start by saying I should have communicated better in the beginning of the week leading up to weekend my in-laws were visiting with T.  (I did not do so because I didn’t want to taint the weekend with my feelings)

I was invited to a house warming party for my best friend, I also offered to help make food because her s/o told all his friends she would be ordering pizza for all of them. So I thought the least I could do was help. So we talked about it and I was making food to bring. This was planned way before my in-laws texted about possibly coming up.
And yes Ik a house warming party doesn’t seem like a big deal but it was to me at least since they rebuilt this house after her boyfriends previously burnt down. So to me this is a big deal to be there for them. 

Little backstory about why I said possibly, those in-laws have said and previously made plans with T and I about coming up multiple times before (abt 5), in which T and I had cleared our schedules. (They’re about 4 hours away so we went to make sure we can spend all the time with them we can) In which they have cancelled on us that morning, and or about an hour before they’re supposed to be here. Every other time it’s because J or S has a migraine. I DO understand how debilitating a migraine can be as T gets them quite often, but when we go to visit them (typically how we see them) he takes migraine medicine and sleeps in the car and I keep the music low. But we still manage to find a way to get there as to not miss time/upset them. (This is also why I was a little upset but there is more clarification at the end of this) 

Let’s get back to it. 
J and S text us and ask if it’s a good weekend for them to come up, where T and I responded that they could come up but it would be possible that T gets mandated for work, and that I had a house warming party, but will only be there for about an hour or two. But that they are more than welcome to come and spend time with their grandchild. So they agreed to come and said it was fine about T with work. 

On Friday T and I were out and about picking up some things from the store and me going to the house warming party came up and he wasn’t happy with me for going, an missing some time with his parents, and I told him look I’m sorry but this is my best friend and with everything they’ve been through this past year and the fact I’m bringing food I’m not backing out on them, I feel in my own heart for my own sake I need to go. And he was a little upset and asked a little more on why I was making that decision and I calmly said “I’m a little upset with J and S and I have my reasons, we can talk about this more when the weekend is over and they are home so we don’t ruin the weekend, and I would like to talk to them about this when the weekend is over so we can sort it all out.” And he said “okay I understand that’s fine.” I said “I’m not going to be gone the whole night just about an hour or two and I will meet up with you guys whether it be dinner or swimming when I leave, and I do look forward to spending time with them but this is also important.” And this convo ended there and switched to something different.

Saturday rolls around (day of housewarming) and they show up (2hrs late supposed to be here by 12, got here right around 2 give or take a few min). They knocked on the door as I was cooking and preparing trays and food, I opened the door and said “Hi, Hello how was your drive? It’s nice to see you! I’m in the middle of cooking and my hands are a mess or I’d give you guys a hug!” (I opened the door with my elbows) 
All I got in response is “Hi. Good, where’s *baby’s name*” I responded with “ baby is back in baby’s bedroom playing with my mom, and T.” (We also currently live with my parents and I can dive into that if anyone has any questions as to why etc.) 
So they turn and head back there to the bedroom and are in there for a good while.

S and her kid come out into the kitchen and asked me what I was doing and I explained that I was making food for my friends housewarming party and explained why, and said I would drop off the food and hang out for an hour or two and then meet them wherever they were to spend the rest of the night with them. They said “okay sounds good” and went straight back into the baby’s room to get some baby lovins and playtime!
I quickly got myself changed and put my hair up an mascara on in the mean time then met them in the baby’s room to hang out with them and talk with them for about a good hour before they left. In the meantime T had asked me about my plans another 3 times infront of them to which I had reiterated the same thing that I told so S and J over text and again to S and her kid in the kitchen.

Around 4 they decided they were leaving for dinner (house warming started at 5) and I still has some stuff in the oven that I was waiting on before I took food. So I told T I would be switching the car seat from my car over to his car (my car is the primary car) for them to go. So I go out and T follows, and as I’m in his car hooking everything up T comes completely undone on me. Raising his voice a little (this rarely ever happens) and I honestly don’t remember to much of it beside I kinda blocked it out because I don’t respond well to someone coming at me/attacking me with being loud an words. I would much rather talk like adults. 
But that he was upset with me for my decision, didn’t think I should go, and told me that all I think about is myself. And then walked away to which I laughed at because I was just really awkward from getting yelled at, and if I’m stressed or upset that’s just my first reaction to relieve stress I guess. And also the fact I thought it was absolutely ridiculous to get upset over something that was going to take up so little of my time compared to how much time I was going to be spending with the in-laws, and it’s something important and was planned beforehand not something that just happened to pop up. (He didn’t hear me laugh btw.)

So I got back inside and I said goodbye to everyone and told them to have a nice dinner and that I would meet up with them later. And I got a quick “bye” and everyone was out the door.

I got the food all done and packed it in my car and was on the way to the house warming party, I left a little late as what was in the oven needed a little extra time, I let my friend and T know. My friend understood and said it was okay a lot of people hadn’t shown up yet, and T didn’t answer. 
So anyways I get to the party at 5:50-6 and stayed until 8. I was at the house by 8:15. 
I texted T while I was there and told him I was hanging out with some moms and their babies, and that I missed my baby and asked how he was doing and I got “don’t fu***ng text me” to which I replied “I understand your mad but I’m just asking how the baby is, I’m his other parent and I deserve to know.” To which I got “baby’s fine” “now don’t text me”. So I told him we would talk about it when we both get home. I texted T when I left at 8 and said “hey leaving now just said goodbye and getting into the car, where can I meet you guys at? Are you swimming.” To which I got “don’t bother we just left” so I said “okay I will meet you at home.”
(keep in mind S put herself to sleep really early and they’re staying in a hotel as my moms house doesn’t have enough room to accommodate them, especially with us now being there with a baby, and they know this) 

I just pulled in as T and the baby were going through the door. I played with the baby on the floor, gave the baby a bath and put baby to bed. I go downstairs and got changed for bed. Sat on the bed and looked at T and said “hey I think we need to talk about what happened today and how you blew up on me while I was switching the car seat. I’m also really sorry I couldn’t make swimming, but I’m looking forward to spending time with them tomorrow.” 
To which T blew up on me, raised his voice and said some things I tuned out because it hurt and again I don’t react good to having someone raise their voice at me. But I didn’t hear and can’t get out of my head T saying “idc if you only hung out with moms and their babies, your baby was at dinner with me and my parents and where you were some mom you are, some wife you are for not being at dinner” to which I interrupted and said “sorry for interrupting but this isn’t getting us anywhere, we can talk about this when you calm down, because if not it’s just going to become a fight and I really don’t want to argue with you.” So T got up and sat down in a chair across the room and took a couple min to collect himself. And when he was ready to talk we did. 
I shared that I made my decision to go there instead of dinner is because I felt more wanted and valued there, and also the fact I was a little upset with S and J (J is his dad and S is his step mom). I shared that I was upset with how they have previously ditched us, and then didn’t even attempt to call or anything to just talk an or ft to see their grandchild. And the fact they don’t reach out about their grandchild what so ever, if they do reach out it’s very rare (usually us reaching out to them) and it’s always about T which is fair, he’s their son. But he also has a family now, wouldn’t you want to know about them too time to time? I expressed I also send them pictures all the time and I get absolutely no response. ZERO. And it made me upset. 
My friend on the other hand texts me daily, asks me how I’m doing (PPD has been REAL the past couple of months) and helps me get through/talk through things. And ALWAYS asks about my baby, asks for pictures, and always responds to any pictures I send her. Also the fact that this house warming is bitter sweet for her and her bf, I was there for her and him when it burnt down. (Now I will say I was VERY pregnant when their house burnt down and I didn’t have much to donate, but I was there in every other way I possibly could have been.)
So all around I felt my decision was very fair, and that I would apologize if I had hurt their feelings when I see them the next day. 

T agreed with me and said he completely understands and he feels the same way, he apologized for raising his voice and saying what he said to me, and knows that apologizing won’t make it right for some of the things that he said. 
T said they were upset with me, and they were not happy with me at dinner. And we don’t talk about anything further with the situation that night as it had gotten late and I was just over the stupid drama and needing to explain myself over and over again. 

I told T I was going to church in the morning to which he said “S and J want to do breakfast around 9 ish, so could you please skip tomorrow” and  said “yes because I had missed dinner I at least owe them breakfast.”

T and I get up in the morning (7-7:30) and get the baby around to go for breakfast, we were waiting on a “I’m on my way text” and or a “meet us here text” but we got nothing. 9:30 am rolls around and I needed some coffee.( usually get up at 4 for the gym and have a coffee on the way there so I was in desperate need)
I take the baby with me as the baby loves car rides so we went, I got coffee and I got a call from Ts mom (let’s call her O), it was about thanksgiving, and she asked me how the baby and I were doing and how T was doing. In the meantime while I’m in the phone I drive back to the house and the baby fell asleep, so I parked in front of the house and talked in the phone. I was on the phone for a good 1hr an 30 min when S and J finally arrive at 11:20. They walked past my car J waves and S and her kid look at me and turn away and walk into the house. So I end my phone call and say goodbye, and go inside.

I walk inside with the baby and say good morning, how are you guys and out the baby down. To which I got now reply, S, J, and her kid let the bag crawl into the middle of the floor (they’re all saying hello to the baby) and then sit down with their backs to me, while T is sitting on the couch not saying anything. I tried to start up some conversation to then get int apologizing and each time I was completely ignore d. By this time T had fallen asleep leaving me completely alone in all of this awkwardness. They stayed for a hour gave the baby all the hugs and kissed and said goodbye to the baby, handed the baby to me, hugged T while he was SLEEPING, and then walked half way out the door and said “bye” to me and hurried off into the truck to leave. 

I didn’t even get the chance to apologize because I was ignored the whole hour they were there, and they had their backs turned to me. I guess I could of said it out loud, but I was also in the mind set of the fact I tried to talk to them about 10 times and have gotten ignored, so I’m not going to apologize now because it got me mad and then it wouldn’t have ment anything. 

I woke T up after they left, and told him what had happened and he said he would call J. 
For context: I am a stay at home mom, this was T and my joint decision. T works nights, and decided to take on school. I was looking at going back to school and then next thing you know T was enrolled and starting classes. And someone has to be with the baby so that is on the back burner for me right now.  (Ik we’re staying at my parents but they both work and it would be really hard rn)

After he said he could call his dad we talked more about what when on and what was said while I was at the house warming party. 
T and the bay met S and J at the hotel to follow them to dinner. J got into the car with T and is going to drive to the restaurant with home while S and her kid take the truck there. 
When J got into the car he asked T “what’s up, why isn’t she (me) coming?” T said “she has the housewarming party an I’m not really happy with her right now, but it’s her decision and she’s going to do what she’s going to do, she will meet up with us later” to which J said “honestly I’m really mad at her for not being here, she can see that friend any time and we spent the time and money to come up here, it’s just rude” to which T didn’t reply. J then brought up how it was nice that T was able to get off of work and they agreed. J then asked what I was going. T said “what do you mean” J then said “what is she doing for work” T then said “nothing right now her and I both agreed for her to be a stay at home mom right now, actually I’m the one that had that idea in the first place she and the baby are happy and healthy and that’s all that matters. She is also applying to things here and there so see if she gets anything but she has gotten no interest and has even messaged back to see if they have received an application and still hasn’t gotten a reply. So she is trying but it’s also not a priority for either of us right now, if she gets one great if not we’re doing just fine.” To which J responded with “well I disagree that she’s just sitting there doing nothing.” To which T said “she doesn’t just do nothing, she takes care of the baby, the does the laundry and not just for us and the baby the whole house to help, she preps and or cooks dinner for everyone, runs everyone’s errands, cleans up around the house, does the dishes etc, she’s not just doing nothing dad.” To which he responds “I disagree, you married your mother and that’s why we didn’t work out.”
Nothing else was said and the rest of the short drive was silent. 

At dinner J asked if I was coming, and T said I don’t know she said she would text me when she’s leaving. J told him to check. T did and I didn’t text because I was driving. So T said no. To which J said “of course because she knows she’s wrong.” And the conversation turned to something different. 

Then finances were brought up, they asked how I was spending his money. If I gave him a hard time when he said no about spending his money. Brought up me working again, and then said I was bitchy. All in-front of/to my child and my husband. Granted my baby obviously doesn’t know what they’re saying but it’s disrespectful. And frankly OUR (Ts words not mine) finances are none of their business. 

T told them I don’t spend money unless it’s necessary (which is true, t will talk me into get my nails done once a month, and I triple check each time just to make sure it’s good and I won’t be setting him behind on anything), said I need give him a hard time if he says no but he works hard enough that he wouldn’t have to if I would ask for something, reiterated what he said to his dad about me working, and asked what they meant about bitchy which was then ignored. 

Don’t get me wrong I will own up when I’m wrong or bitchy, but I truly have been nothing but nice and respectful to these people ever since I had met them 5-6 years ago. I’m never rude unless you give me a reason to and even then I typically will just be nice or very vague
Because I don’t have much to say and or just don’t want to be mean. It’s just not who I am. 

That was the end of the talk about me at dinner then they went swimming and nothing was said and then we had met at home. 

I was upset by what they had to say, I was also upset that my husband didn’t really stick up for me in a way. He should have shut it down in the first place. He even admitted to that. I’m still upset but we’re talking it out, and he’s really missing my butt even tho he doesn’t have to. I’d rather just talk it out and have him do it for now on heading into the future. 
He saw how it was disrespectful at dinner/at the house. Then said he was also upset with me at the time. I told him it gave him no excuse, I wouldn’t let anyone talk about him that way and the people around me know it and wouldn’t even try it. And it should be the same for him. He agreed and then we went to bed. 

T said he was going to call his dad later on in the evening. In which he did. And it did not go how he thought it was going to go. 

The baby has just woken up, so I will have to update with the phone call after the baby goes back down, and or  tomorrow if yall would like to hear how that went!
(It will make more sense when I can update with the phone call)

I woke before the sunrise on our fifth anniversary, my heart fluttering with anticipation. For months, I'd been secretly working on Vincenzo's gift—a portrait capturing our happiest memories together. The morning light filtered through our bedroom curtains as I slipped out of bed, careful not to wake him.

In the kitchen, I prepared his favorite breakfast: eggs benedict with freshly squeezed orange juice and the aromatic Italian coffee he loved so much. The table was set with our wedding china, a small vase of red roses at the center. Everything had to be perfect today.

I heard his footsteps on the stairs and smoothed down my silk robe, suddenly feeling nervous. Five years of marriage, and still my heart raced when he entered a room.

""Happy anniversary,"" I said, my voice soft with affection as he appeared in the doorway.

Vincenzo stood there in his tailored suit, already dressed for work. His dark hair was perfectly styled, not a strand out of place. But something in his expression made my smile falter—a coldness I'd been noticing more frequently these past months.

""I have something for you,"" he said, his voice devoid of the warmth I craved.

My fingers instinctively went to my wedding ring, twisting it as I often did when anxious. ""I have something for you too. But let's eat first while it's hot.""

""This can't wait."" He placed a manila envelope on the table, pushing aside the roses I'd arranged so carefully.

""What's this?"" I asked, though something in me already knew—a premonition settling like ice in my stomach.

""Your anniversary gift."" His lips curled into what might have been a smile on anyone else. ""Divorce papers.""

The world seemed to tilt beneath me. ""Is this some kind of joke?""

""I've never been more serious, Maria."" He loosened his tie slightly. ""I want a divorce so I can have a proper seven-day romance with Kaiya Bell.""

Kaiya Bell. His new intern. Twenty-three years old with honey-blonde hair and eyes that widened with practiced innocence whenever he entered the room. I'd seen her at the company Christmas party, hanging on his every word.

""Seven days?"" I repeated, my voice sounding distant to my own ears.

""Yes. Seven days to experience what real passion feels like again."" He checked his watch. ""I've invited her for dinner tonight. I expect you to be civil.""

I stared at the breakfast I'd prepared with such care, now growing cold between us. ""You want me to host dinner for your mistress? In our home?""

""Our home for now,"" he corrected. ""And yes. It's the least you could do to make this transition smooth.""

The least I could do. As if I owed him this final humiliation.

That evening, I found myself setting the dining table for three, my movements mechanical. The doorbell rang, and Vincenzo rushed to answer it with an eagerness I hadn't seen directed at me in years.

Kaiya floated in wearing a white dress that screamed false innocence, her perfume filling our home like an invasive species. She kissed Vincenzo full on the lips before turning to me with a saccharine smile.

""Maria! Thank you so much for having me."" She handed me a bottle of cheap wine. ""Vincenzo says you're being so understanding about everything.""

Dinner was an exercise in torture. I watched as Kaiya fed Vincenzo from her fork, giggling at his every word while I pushed food around my plate. Our dog Max circled the table, sensing the tension.

""Oh, what a darling puppy!"" Kaiya cooed, beckoning Max to her. She scratched behind his ears, then glanced at me with calculated innocence. ""Maria, may I see your wedding ring? Vincenzo told me it's quite special.""

Before I could respond, Vincenzo answered, ""Of course she doesn't mind.""

Reluctantly, I slipped off my ring—the platinum band with tiny diamonds that Vincenzo had placed on my finger five years ago, promising forever. Kaiya examined it with exaggerated interest before suddenly slipping it onto Max's collar.",1,1763186580.0,u_WeeklyMall2979,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I keep thinking about loyalty, the real kind, the kind nobody markets or puts on a mug. It’s not poetic loyalty or movie-scene loyalty. It’s the sort that trudges over with morning breath, plops down on your lap before you’ve had coffee, and decides you’re the center of the universe for reasons that still don’t make any logical sense.



That’s a dog. That’s the whole magic trick.



People dress it up like something complicated. Experts write books. Influencers pose with pups like they cracked the code. Meanwhile, a dog just knows you, in that blunt, almost embarrassing way that lands deeper than you expect. They read your highs, your lows, your fake “I’m fine” voice, the little twitches you pretend no one notices, even the strange late-night pacing you swear is subtle. They memorize you without trying.



Some folks call that ownership. I’ve never believed it.

You don’t own something that watches you like you’re half saint, half disaster, and stays anyway.



A dog appoints you. It feels almost ceremonial, even if it happens in the middle of a living room so messy the socks have basically claimed squatter’s rights. They map your routine like cartographers of chaos. They sit beside you during the parts of life you don’t post online, the quiet, strange, lonely bits. They see the cracks you pretend aren’t there.



Maybe they forgive them quicker than you do.



Every now and then I catch myself wondering how many creatures in this world end up chained by frustration or cruelty or the plain laziness of humans who forget softness is a choice. Dogs shouldn’t be part of that equation. A dog belongs on the couch, head on your knee, stealing the blanket and pretending not to notice you noticed.



A chained dog feels like a moral typo. Our mistake showing itself in plain view.

Impatience, control, the simple failure to see devotion when it’s right there offering itself with muddy paws.



There’s a particular kind of peace when a dog curls into your ribs and lets out that long, heavy sigh, like they set down a whole day that never even weighed on them. The sound lands somewhere deep, right in the place where you hide the things you never say. It pushes you to straighten up a little, to try acting like the person they already decided you are.



Because they believe it. My god, do they ever.



So yes, I’m old school. Dogs belong on couches, not chains. They belong in the real security of a home, in the warm chaos of everyday life, in those soft little pockets of quiet when the world finally shuts up long enough for you to hear your own thoughts.



If that isn’t friendship in its cleanest, most honest form, I’m not sure what else would qualify.



Do YOU agree?



Couches Not Chains

By BR.Giga 



I have seen loyalty in its plainest shape,

curled beneath a blanket on a quiet couch,

a dog breathing evenly in the glow

of firelight and December lamps.



There is a goodness in a creature

who asks for nothing

but the nearness of your ribs,

your steady hand,

the simple warmth of being allowed to stay.



The children on the floor whisper stories,

their joy soft as falling ash

from the wood stove’s gentle crackle,

and the dog lifts one sleepy eye

as if to bless the noise.



I believe in this ordinary grace,

this humble room,

where devotion arrives without ceremony,

where the tree lights flicker like tiny glad hearts,

where a dog’s sigh

is enough to soften the whole evening.



We are shaped by moments like these,

moments without spectacle,

where love settles into the furniture,

where trust curls up beside us

and decides we are worthy.



Let me tell you,

a dog on a couch is the truest kind of peace

this country still remembers.

No chains,

no fear,

just the steady companionship

of a life that wants only to share its warmth.



There is still hope in such a room.

There is still mercy in such a friendship.



I believe in the ordinary

because it is where we are most human.



And in this soft circle of firelight and breath,

I am reminded:

we belong to those we care for,

and they belong to us,

in the gentlest way a heart can hold.",1,1763185824.0,KeepWriting,0,0.67,False

I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

On the staffing spreadsheet, I’m still “Senior Ranger – East District.” My badge still has my name on it. But when someone on the radio says “motion alarm, Birch Run,” I suddenly remember the copier is jammed or there’s a training module I should really finish.

The incident report is short.

“September 28 — Ranger Benjamin Ortega responded to motion activation and 911 hang-up at decommissioned Birch Run Campground. Cleared scene at 02:03. No subjects located. Evidence of unauthorized entry, ongoing missing persons investigation.”

Four lines. Suitable for filing cabinets and audits.

This is the rest of it.

Birch Run used to be the busy place.

Families, scout troops, RV caravans with plastic flamingos and those hokey “The Smiths’ Home On Wheels” signs. A paved loop, forty sites, a little amphitheater where someone used to do campfire talks about bears and Leave No Trace. The whole thing sits in a shallow bowl of mixed pine and aspen a mile off Highway 17, between mile markers 142 and 143. The old green “142” marker has two bullet dents that have been there longer than I’ve worked here.

Ten years ago a freak storm rolled off the plateau, dumped too much rain in too little time, and the creek that usually minds its business turned into a battering ram. It ate half the lower loop, took out two footbridges, and undercut the slope behind the amphitheater until part of it slumped. Nobody died, but a couple of tents went for an unexpected swim, and the photos of RVs with water up to their hubcaps made the local news.

The state did a cost-benefit analysis and slapped CLOSED - AREA UNSAFE signs on everything instead of fixing it.

These days Birch Run is technically a “non-operational asset.” In practice that means we use one of the upper bathrooms to store old picnic tables, check the road culverts twice a year, and chase off teenagers who want to drink warm beer in abandoned campsites.

If I’m being honest, for nine and a half years it was just one more place on my patrol list. No special feeling, no ghost stories.

The night everything changed was a Thursday at the tail end of the season. Late September. The main campground at Lake Hermit still had a few trailers hanging on to their spots, clinging to summer. The air smelled like dust and cooling pine. Day crews had clocked out around six. I was at the ranger station finishing a report on a fire ring someone built directly under a low-hanging juniper.

The base radio burped.

“Ranger One, County.”

I clipped my handheld off the charger and thumbed it. “One here. Go ahead.”

“We’ve got a 911 hang-up pinging off the tower by your Birch Run turnoff,” the dispatcher said. Her voice had that half-tired, half-wired tone you get on slow nights when something finally happens. “Call came in at 00:41. Open line, background noise only. They didn’t answer callback. GPS puts it near the old payphone by the Birch Run entrance. You still have a landline out there?”

“Payphone’s been dead since I started,” I said. “We cut the copper five years ago.”

“Okay, that’s weird,” she said, and I could hear her scribbling. “Also, your motion sensor on the Birch Run entry gate tripped at 00:39. That one went to your office voicemail.”

I glanced at the little blinking light on the desk phone. We get deer false alarms a couple times a month.

“Any units closer than me?” I asked.

“Negative. Trooper’s tied up on a rollover down by the canyon. SAR coordinator’s asleep and will bite my head off if I call him for a ghost at a closed campground.”

“Lucky me,” I said. “I’ll go check it out.”

Behind me, the old analog wall clock ticked. 00:49. The fluorescents hummed. The coffee in the pot had gone from bad to something worse; there was already a dark ring burned into the bottom of the carafe I’d be scrubbing in the morning.

“You going solo?” County asked.

“Yeah. I’ll only be out there long enough to tell some kids to pick up their beer cans.”

“Copy, One. Check back when you hit the gate.”

My truck knows the Birch Run road by feel. So do I.

You leave the highway at a brown sign that still says BIRCH RUN CAMPGROUND in faded letters, someone’s stuck a “CLOSED” plaque over it with self-tapping screws. The paved spur turns to rough chipseal after two hundred yards, then to cracked asphalt with grass down the center. Reflectors on the posts are half shot out, half peeled. We keep meaning to replace them; there’s always something more urgent.

At night the road is a pale stripe between trees. Headlights catch the birch trunks and turn them into bare bones. A little rabbit ran ahead of me for a stretch, staying just inside the beam like it wanted a ride.

The gate came up faster than I expected. Two square posts, a galvanized pipe strung between them, a sagging length of chain and a Master padlock the size of my fist. Someone had slapped a NO ENTRY / AREA UNSAFE notice on each post in plastic sleeves. A camera about the size of a deck of cards watched from the top of the right post, red LED winking.

I pulled up short, put the truck in park, and hopped out.

The padlock was hanging from the chain but not snapped shut. The chain itself was hooked, not threaded. Whoever had gone in had tried to make it look closed again.

I lifted the chain off, let it clatter. The sound bounced around the trees in a way that made the night feel more crowded than it was.

“County, Ranger One at Birch Run,” I said into the handheld. “Gate’s been opened and re-hung. No other vehicles in the turnout. I’m going to roll up to the kiosk, see if there’s a car parked inside.”

“Copy, One,” County said. “Time check is 00:57. You solo?”

“Affirmative.”

I eased the truck past the gate and up the cracked entry road. Old reflector stakes flashed, then went dark. The first thing you hit is the fee kiosk and a tiny parking apron. After that, the road turns into the loop.

The kiosk appeared out of the dark like always: a little brown cabinet with a metal roof, tilted slightly from frost heave. The glass behind the bulletin board was spider-cracked in one corner. Inside, the campground map had faded until the green for “trees” and the blue for “creek” were almost the same color. Someone had popped off one of the plastic holders and stuck a faded brochure for a zipline park over the “You are here” dot.

The parking apron was empty. No cars, no motorcycles, no bikes abandoned in a heap. Just old tire marks in the dust and a mound of gravel we’d dumped there a year ago and never spread.

I stopped, sat for a second with the engine idling. The only light was my headlights and the faint reflection off the kiosk glass.

On the inside of the kiosk door someone had taped one of our “Campground Full” tags from back when that mattered. It still had the little tear-off stubs for reserving sites. Every stub along the bottom edge had been neatly torn off.

I don’t know why that detail snagged me so hard. I made a mental note then. I didn’t know yet why it would matter.

“County, no vehicles at the kiosk,” I said. “I’m going to drive the upper loop once. If I see anything that looks like a party, I’ll call for a unit.”

“Copy, One. You are not to enter any structures alone, you hear me? No collapsing bathhouses, no scouting amphitheaters. We’ve been over this.”

“You spoil all my fun,” I said, out of habit more than anything.

I eased the truck forward.

The upper loop lives in that uncanny place between “completely abandoned” and “someone just left.”

The pavement is cracked but not gone. The site posts lean a little, but the numbers are still legible. Old reservation tags ride the clips, some bleached to tan rectangles, others with names you can still read: KHALIL, PETERSON, LIU. The picnic tables are gray and splintery. The fire rings are filled with leaves and pinecones and the occasional glass bottle some kid lobbed in.

I kept the truck in first and rolled slow, windows down.

My headlights washed over Site 3: empty pad, table, fire ring, post.

Site 4: same.

Site 5: same, except the ring of rocks around the fire pit looked… fresh. Uneven ring of rounded stones, some still damp like someone had recently hosed them or pulled them from the creek. No ash in the center. No scorch marks. Just an empty circle, too deliberate.

The way the stones leaned inward bothered me. Like they were all tilting a fraction toward the imaginary center.

I told myself it was kids. Teenagers love moving rocks more than they love anything except leaving trash.

Site 7 had another rock ring. Site 10 had two.

“Somebody’s been playing,” I muttered.

At Site 14 I hit the brakes.

The pull-in, on the outside of the loop overlooking the drop toward the creek, was occupied.

Not by a car. By a campsite.

Chairs—four of them—sat in a semicircle around the ring. Folding camp chairs, the cheap kind you buy at Walmart or Family Dollar, all different colors. An old Coleman two-burner stove rested on the picnic table. A blue cooler sat open on the ground, lid propped back. A lantern on the table flickered on low, lighting the whole scene in a pale, dirty yellow.

Nobody was there.

I killed the engine by reflex and the world dropped into quiet. The little hiss from the lantern suddenly felt loud.

The chairs faced the fire ring but were too close, their feet almost in the circle. One chair had a child-sized fleece hoodie draped over the back, sleeves hanging like arms. Another had a baseball cap parked on the seat. The cooler was full of melted ice water and floating cans. When I stepped closer and shone my flashlight, I could see that the labels were still sharp. The expiration dates on the juice boxes inside were current.

This wasn’t leftover from ten years ago.

“Anyone here?” I called. “Park service!”

My voice fell flat. No answering “yeah?” No rustle of someone climbing out of a tent. The right way to do it would’ve been to stand still and listen for a full minute. I managed maybe ten seconds.

The lantern on the table was an old battery model, plastic base, frosted tube, little dial on the side. The beam from my handheld caught the brand name: RAYOVAC ROUGHNECK. It flickered again, not with the smooth fade of a dying battery but with odd stutters, bright-dim-bright, like someone was blocking and unblocking the LED inside.

That’s when the smell drifted up.

Not rot. Not smoke. Pine cleaner. The same sharp, fake “fresh” the bathhouse used to have when it was still open and the maintenance crew dumped a gallon of concentrate in the mop bucket.

It was faint, but wrong out here. Too indoor.

I gave the site another sweep with my light. No tents. No hammocks. No footprints I could see without getting down on hands and knees. Just the set dressing.

“County, Ranger One,” I said quietly. “I’ve got an active-looking camp setup in closed Birch Run. Chairs, stove, food, but no people present. One battery lantern lit. No vehicle on the loop. Please advise if you’ve got any missing persons reports from the last few hours.”

“Stand by,” County said. I heard keyboard clacks. “Nothing reported in the last six from your area. We had a domestic in town and a shoplifter at the Walmart. That’s it.”

“Copy,” I said. “Any chance trooper could swing by the Birch Run road and sit on the gate?”

“He’s still on the rollover,” she said. “You want me to wake Miller for SAR?”

“Not yet,” I said. “I’m going to finish the loop, check the bathhouse. If I don’t find anyone, then we start making phone calls.”

“Copy. Time check is 01:12. Check in at quarter.”

The farther I went, the more “almost a campsite”s I found.

Site 18 had two chairs and a tablecloth laid out, white with little strawberries printed on it. The cloth was wrong-side up, the tag showing. The edges were folded under instead of hanging. The chairs faced the wrong way, backs to the fire ring.

Site 21 had three sleeping bags laid side by side on the pad, zipped up with nobody in them. Pillows at the top, indentations in the foam like heads had pressed them recently—but when I ran my hand over one, the impression was cold and bounced back too fast, like memory foam recovering from being squeezed while I wasn’t looking.

At Site 24, every item was centered. Chair in the exact middle of the pad. Cooler in the exact middle of the table. Fire ring stones aligned like someone had taken a carpenter’s square to them.

It all felt like whoever had arranged it had a list that said:

CAMP = CHAIR, FIRE, FOOD, NIGHT

and was checking off boxes, but had never actually sat by a fire in their life.

The bathhouse loomed up out of the dark after Site 30, at the bend where the loop starts to drop toward the amphitheater. Single-story cinderblock rectangle, green metal roof, men’s on the left, women’s on the right, “SHOWERS” sign so faded it just looked like white ghosts of letters.

In my headlights, the doors looked shut. The security light over the center had burned out a long time ago. The tiny window fans were dead. It should have been a black, blank shape.

Instead, light leaked out under the men’s side door. Not bright, not flickering. Steady, like a fluorescent or a cell phone flashlight left face-down.

A minivan squatted in the pull-through next to it. Silver Honda Odyssey with an “I BRAKE FOR HIKERS” bumper sticker, plates from our state. The front windows were fogged. One of those little tree air fresheners hung from the mirror, perfectly still.

My stomach tightened.

I pulled up behind it, angled to point my headlights at the bathhouse door, and got out.

The van’s hood was still warm under my palm. Not hot, but not cold-soaked either. It hadn’t been sitting there for days.

Driver’s door: closed. Back doors: closed. No visible damage. When I cupped my hands around my flashlight and peered in, I saw the usual family disaster: snacks in the cupholders, a crumpled map of the state on the passenger seat, a stuffed animal face-down on the floor in the back.

In the middle row, a kid’s booster seat sat empty. The seat belt lay slack over it like someone had unbuckled in a hurry.

“County, I’ve got a silver Honda Odyssey at Birch Run bathhouse,” I said, giving her the plate. “Appears recently parked. Lights inside men’s side are on. I’m going to make entry.”

“Copy, One,” she said. Her voice was tighter now. “Trooper is twenty-five out if he leaves right this second. You do not go in if you hear a domestic; you back out and wait. You hear me?”

“If they’re screaming at each other, I can live with that,” I said. “If there’s a kid stuck in a stall, I’m not waiting twenty-five.”

I walked up to the bathhouse door.

The light under it pulsed once and steadied. When I touched the handle, it was smooth with Pine-Sol residue, the kind that never fully washes off.

The door opened on the second push. The hinges complained. The smell hit me like a shove.

Pine cleaner, stale piss, old damp concrete. The usual. Under it, something else: a faint metallic tang and a whiff of something like singed plastic.

The light came from three ceiling fixtures in a row, flickering slightly. Tubes coated in dust, buzzing. Those should not have been on. Power to the campground had been cut at the main panel when they closed it.

“Hello?” I called. “Park service. Is anybody in here?”

My voice bounced off tile and cinderblock. No answer.

The men’s side had the usual layout: sinks on one wall, urinals and stalls on the other, showers in the back. Graffiti from before the closure was still visible: “LOGAN ’09,” a crude peace sign, “S+J” in a heart. Someone had tagged “FREE CANDY” on the paper towel dispenser and drawn an arrow to the tampon bin. People are imaginative in the most boring ways.

The stall doors were all open.

The first sink dripped. It had been dripping since the last time I’d done a walk-through in March, and probably for ten years before that. Our plumber keeps telling us he needs a new gasket; our budget keeps telling him to get in line.

On the counter by the third sink, someone had lined up three toothbrushes in a row. Red, blue, purple. Their heads all pointed the same direction, equidistant. No toothpaste in sight.

On the floor next to the diaper changing station, there were shoes.

Four pairs, all neatly against the wall, toes pointing out. Two adult sneakers, women’s size, a little dirt on the sides. One pair of men’s hiking shoes, still knotted. One pair of pink light-up kids’ sneakers with tiny rainbows on the sides.

No socks in them. No feet.

I don’t know how long I stood there looking at that row. My brain tried to make it into “family got ready for bed, left shoes there, went to wash up.” But you don’t leave shoes in the men’s side like that. You don’t line them up like a display.

Something ticked in the far corner, metal on tile, soft and quick. Not pipe noise. Something small making contact with something hard.

“County,” I said, keeping my voice low. “I’ve got a family van, an active-looking campsite, and four empty pairs of shoes lined up in the men’s bathhouse. No people present. It smells like someone mopped in here about an hour ago.”

“You’re not funny, One,” she said. “Trooper is en route, SAR pager is warming up. You get out of that building and wait.”

I took a step toward the shower area instead.

Rationally, I know that was stupid. Or at least unnecessary. But once you’ve seen empty kids’ shoes in a line, you don’t walk away without checking behind the next wall.

The showers were in their own alcove: four stalls with mildewed curtains, two on each side, drains in the middle. The floor sloped, slick with a decade of grime.

The first curtain on the left was closed.

The others were half-open, bunched.

If this were a movie, this is the part where the audience would be yelling at the screen. Real life doesn’t come with background music. It just comes with the sound of your own blood in your ears and the occasional drip hitting tile.

I reached for the closed curtain and pulled it aside.

Empty.

No body in the stall. No pile of clothes. No blood.

Just a plastic laundry basket in the corner with a few damp towels neatly rolled, like a hotel. The towel on top still had the fold crease.

I let the curtain fall. It moved sluggishly, plastic sticking to itself.

Something brushed my shoulder.

I jerked, spun, nearly slipped.

Nothing was there.

The air, though, had moved. A slow shift, like someone had walked past quickly.

The dripping at the sink had stopped.

All three fluorescent fixtures flickered at once, a quick stutter, then steadied. The buzz rose a pitch, then settled.

“Okay,” I said aloud. “Okay. Enough.”

I backed out, step by step, never turning my back fully on the room until I hit the outer door with my shoulder and pushed through into the night. The cool air hit my face like a slap.

The minivan sat where I’d left it. My truck’s hazard lights winked, forgotten. The arranged campsites stood in their careful little patterns.

Every hair on my arms was standing up.

“County, One,” I said. “Men’s bathhouse is empty of people. I’ve got fresh personal items and some weird staging: shoes, toothbrushes, towels. I’m going to do a quick check of the amphitheater hill and then get the hell out of here until backup arrives.”

“Language noted,” she said. “Miller’s awake. You’re on a short leash, Ortega.”

“Understood,” I said.

The amphitheater sits below the bathhouse, down a short footpath lined with timbers that are now mostly rot and moss. Four curved rows of log benches face a concrete pad and a metal fire circle. Behind it is a little wooden stage with a roof and a place to hang a projection screen.

When they closed the campground, they stacked benches from the lower loop there. Last time I’d seen it, it was a messy pile under dust and leaves.

Tonight, the path down was clear.

Every log bench was back in its original place. Four rows, evenly spaced, facing the stage. Someone had scraped moss off the tops and flipped the ones that were too rotten. The concrete pad had been swept. No branches, no leaves, no dirt.

The fire circle in front of the stage was full of stones, arranged in a tidy ring.

My flashlight cut across the benches, then landed on the stage.

There was someone standing there.

For half a second, that was the only way my brain could phrase it: someone. Upright shape in the light.

Then the details came into focus.

It was built out of campground debris.

A stack of camp chairs formed the torso, nested together, their legs splayed for balance. Two coolers stood where hips should be. Four folding tables leaned together to make the rough outline of legs. A bundle of rolled sleeping bags was lashed across the top for shoulders. On that sat a cluster of lanterns—five of them, old Coleman fuel lamps and new battery ones, arranged in a rough circle with their glass globes facing out.

All of them were on.

Not bright. A low, gut-level glow from each, so the cluster of them made a single dull corona. Light fell across the benches in a fan.

From where I stood, it looked like a person giving a talk. A ranger in a pile of borrowed gear.

No one had tied this together with rope. There weren’t any obvious straps holding it. The pieces seemed to lean and balance on each other in a way that shouldn’t have held as still as it did.

As I watched, one of the lanterns in the “head” bundle pulsed. The light inside flared, dimmed, flared, not in sync with the others. The surrounding glass caught and magnified it.

A sound drifted out.

Not a voice at first. A murmur. The faint rustle you get when a campground is half full and people are talking at their own fires, layered on each other. Laughter in the mix, kids arguing about s’mores, someone playing music too low to identify.

It seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. Then my ear picked out the source: a cheap Bluetooth speaker wedged on the stage floor by the table-legs, its blue light blinking. It crackled and repeated a four-second loop.

“…no, you had the last one—hey, quit it—no, you had the last one—hey, quit it—”

The same snippet, over and over. Young boy’s voice, maybe nine or ten. The laughter on the loop didn’t quite match the words.

I took a step back up the path. Gravel shifted under my heel.

The whole figure on the stage tilted a fraction in my direction.

Not much. Just enough for the lanterns to throw new angles of light.

I hadn’t seen what was behind it before.

Against the back wall of the stage, in the shadow line, there were outlines. Three. Human-sized. Slumped.

As my light swept, it picked out fabric: a grown man’s jacket, a soft blue women’s hoodie, a child’s red raincoat. They were arranged upright, empty, sleeves dangling. The hoods were pulled up. The fronts were zipped.

Under each set of clothes, at floor level, sat a pair of shoes that matched the line I’d seen in the bathhouse: the adult sneakers, the hiking shoes, the little rainbow light-ups.

Their toes pointed toward the stacked gear figure.

I didn’t go up to touch them. I’d like to say I was thinking about evidence preservation. Mostly I was thinking about my own hands never forgiving me.

The lanterns on the “head” flickered again. The light inside one, a green Coleman, wavered like heat. Around the glass, just at the edges, I saw movement.

Not reflection. Not dust.

Something pale, slick, and many-jointed slid along the inner curve of the globe. It looked like a centipede had been flattened and stretched, its segments pushing against the glass in tiny waves. Where it passed, the light brightened for a heartbeat, then dimmed, like it was pulling power.

The Bluetooth speaker glitched.

The loop hiccuped, then changed.

“…Ben, did you get the—”

My name cracked out of it in an adult woman’s voice, half overlaid by static. It wasn’t my full name, just the first syllable, but it hit hard enough to make my chest tight.

The lantern glow swelled. The gear structure shifted a little more, pieces creaking. One of the sleeping bags at the top slumped and then righted itself like something inside had flexed.

Whatever was in the lanterns moved faster.

The scent of pine cleaner and burnt plastic got stronger.

A spray of gravel shot down from behind me as if someone had kicked it, though I hadn’t moved. The hair at the back of my neck prickled.

There’s a moment on a call when you realize you’re no longer in control of the scene. That you’re not the one deciding what happens next. I’ve had it with drunk drivers, with angry parents, with a black bear that wasn’t impressed by bear spray.

This was different. Less “someone’s going to punch me” and more “something here doesn’t care whether I exist.”

The stacked gear figure gave the tiniest lurch, like it had tried to take a step and hadn’t quite worked out how.

The second lantern from the left in the “head” cracked. Just a hairline. Light flared through it like it was pushing to get out.

I didn’t wait to see what happened if it did.

I turned and ran.

I wasn’t graceful about it. I slipped twice on the gravel path, whacked my shin on a timber, caught myself on a birch trunk at the top. My radio banged against my chest.

“County, One, I’m leaving the amphitheater,” I said between breaths. “There’s… I don’t know how to phrase this without sounding insane. There’s a large structure made of camping gear on the stage, with active lanterns and some kind of… insect or fungal growth in the globes. I’ve got empty clothes arranged like people against the back wall. No bodies. I’m backing out now.”

Silence on the other end for a beat.

Then: “Copy, One,” County said, in a voice that said she was writing every word down even while her brain was rejecting it. “Trooper is fifteen out. Miller wants you at your truck. Repeat: at your truck. Right now.”

“Already on my way,” I said.

As I skirted the bathhouse, every fluorescent tube inside blinked off at once. The seam under the door went from white to black. The humming stopped dead.

The van’s hazard lights flashed once, even though I hadn’t touched them. All four at the same time.

I threw myself into my truck, turned the key, and swung the headlights toward the entry road.

For a second, as the beams passed over the loop, I saw every site that had been arranged—the chairs, the coolers, the sleeping bags, the rings of stones. Each one caught the light at a slightly different angle. The metal parts glinted.

A breeze came down the hill, gentle, carrying the faint sound of something soft shifting. Canvas. Nylon. Tarps rubbing against each other.

I did not look back as I drove out.

At the gate, the chain I’d left hanging loose was threaded back through the posts, the padlock sitting open in its usual place. The camera’s red LED blinked twice, then died.

I pulled through, got out, and snapped the lock shut myself.

My hands were shaking hard enough that it took three tries.

Officially, the search started at first light.

Unofficially, I was back at Birch Run with Miller and two deputies before sunrise, watching our breath in the cold and telling myself daylight would make everything look stupid.

We swept the campground: upper loop, lower loop, bathhouse, amphitheater, creek crossings. SAR volunteers in orange vests pushed through willows along the water. A K9 unit sniffed the trails. The helicopter from the next county over did a couple of lazy circles at mid-morning, servo whine drifting down.

We found the van, same as I had. We found the campsite at Site 14, chairs, cooler, stove, lantern—now dead. We found the neat shoes in the men’s bathhouse, the toothbrushes in a row, the basket of towels.

The amphitheater was not the same.

The benches were piled again, all heaped at one side like someone had broken down an event in a hurry. The stage was bare. No stacked gear figure, no lantern bundles, no speaker, no clothes arranged against the back wall.

We did find a few things that shouldn’t have been there.

A patch of the concrete at the edge of the stage was scorched in a perfect circle about two feet across, as if someone had set a metal barrel there and burned something hot. The blackened area smelled faintly of melted plastic.

In the crack between the stage and the back wall, Miller reached down with gloved fingers and fished out a sliver of glass. It was curved and cloudy, with a thin smear of something pale along the inside.

“From a lantern globe?” one of the deputies asked.

“Maybe,” Miller said. He held it up to the light. The pale smear had a texture. Not powder. Not dried fuel. More like the membrane inside an egg.

He dropped it into an evidence bag and sealed it.

We logged everything. We did the door-to-door with the plate number. We got a call from a worried sister in Tucson who said her brother, his wife, and their eight-year-old had left on a camping trip and hadn’t checked in. Their names matched the registration on the van. We kept looking.

We never found them.

The official narrative settled into place with depressing ease. “Family entered closed campground, possibly via social media tip. Camped in unsafe area. Evidence suggests they may have gone down to the creek after dark. High water from upstream release could have swept them downstream toward the reservoir.”

People like water stories. They’re neat. No monsters, no questions about what else we don’t control. Just current and bad luck.

There’s a line in the final report about “unusual staging of campsites and personal effects, likely the work of unrelated trespassers over years of closure.” It made someone at Region headquarters feel better to put it there. It makes me feel worse every time I see it.

A week after we stopped active searching—the first week of October—I went back once, in the middle of the day, because apparently I don’t learn.

I told myself I was checking the locks and batteries. Making sure the signs were still up. Seeing if someone had broken into the van now that it had become part of the scenery.

It was a bright, thin noon. Aspen leaves had just begun to go from green to gold at the edges. The sky was that high, blank blue that promises colder nights soon. Highway 17 sounded different in the daylight; tire noise has a separate pitch when you’re not listening for anything else.

At the kiosk, someone had flipped the old “Campground Full” tag around so the blank side faced out. All the little reservation stubs along the bottom were torn off again except one.

That one had a name written on it in block letters: ORTEGA.

I stared at it for a while, counted to fifty, then carefully pulled it off and folded it into my pocket. It wasn’t my handwriting. The ink was fresh enough that it smudged on my thumb.

On the upper loop, the sites were messier than before. Rocks scattered, chairs knocked over. Like someone had taken a hand across a toy box.

At Site 14, the cooler was gone. The chairs were still there, collapsed.

The bathhouse was truly dead this time. No power, no smell of cleaner. The row of shoes was missing one of the adult pairs; there was a damp mark on the floor where they’d been, shaped like the soles had been wet when someone stood in them.

I did not go down to the amphitheater.

I stood at the top of the path and listened. Wind in the leaves. A jay complaining. A distant truck on the highway.

Under it, for a second, I heard the faint, tinny burst of a child’s laugh, cut off mid-giggle. Not from the stage. From somewhere between the sites, like someone had turned a speaker on and off.

I walked back to my truck without looking toward where I thought it came from.

We never did get footage from the gate camera that made sense.

The system out there is old. It records motion in twenty-second bursts, overwrites itself every seventy-two hours. That night, at 00:39, the logs say it triggered and saved.

The file plays as fifteen seconds of empty road, headlights just leaving frame, the edge of my truck as I drove in.

For the last five seconds, the chain across the gate moves.

It lifts, droops, lifts again. Not like someone took it off. More like someone underneath it was trying to wriggle out without being noticed. There’s no hand, no body, no shadow. Just the metal rising and falling in smooth arcs, then settling.

I’ve shown it to two different IT guys and one state wildlife biologist. The IT guys shrugged and blamed compression glitches. The biologist watched it twice, frowned, and suggested wind gusts.

There are no leaves moving in the background when the chain lifts.

Nobody’s written anything about that part down. Files are already thick. Budgets are already thin. The last thing anyone wants is a line in a report that says “chain moved on its own.”

So Birch Run stays on the spreadsheet as “Closed — Unsafe Infrastructure.” We tell people the ground there is unstable. That the creek could cut the bank out from under them. That the bathhouse is condemned. All of that is technically true.

We don’t mention the amphitheater. Or the shoes in the men’s side. Or the way campsite setups appear and disappear between patrols.

Every once in a while, a motion alarm still goes off on the gate, usually on still nights. We send the newest ranger out to “take a look,” in daylight, with a partner. They come back with stories about beer cans, graffiti, the usual.

Last month, one of them mentioned seeing a fresh ring of stones around the fire circle at Site 18, no ash, no soot. He said it looked like someone did it just to do it.

“Probably kids,” he said. “Bored kids.”

I nodded and wrote it down like it was nothing.

When I’m honest, I think there’s something in that bowl of trees that hates an empty campground.

I think it learned some version of “camp” from decades of families showing up with their coolers and chairs and plastic lanterns, playing their little songs into the night. I think when the state shut it down, whatever was watching didn’t understand why the pattern stopped.

Now, whenever somebody sneaks in, it studies them. It takes their layout. It copies what it can. It keeps trying to build a full house out of whatever people leave lying around: chairs, shoes, towels, recordings.

Maybe it miscounts sometimes. Maybe it keeps more than it should.

These days, when I’m on lakeside patrol and catch the Birch Run turnoff sign in my side mirror, I keep my eyes on the highway. If the radio crackles and County says “motion at Birch Run” and “911 ping near the old payphone,” I have a sudden urgent need to check the far west boundary fence, or count buoys, or anything that keeps me busy somewhere with other people in shouting distance.

The new rangers roll their eyes. They think I’ve gone soft. “It’s just an abandoned campground,” one of them said last week. “What’s it going to do, bore you to death?”

Miller doesn’t say much. He just glances at me when Birch Run comes up on the call sheet, then quietly assigns someone else.

On the nights I can’t sleep and end up driving, I sometimes pull off at mile marker 142 and sit where the highway curves. From there you can see a suggestion of the Birch Run bowl, a dark patch of trees against slightly darker hills.

If I roll the window down, I can hear the wind and the occasional hiss of a semi on the grade.

Once—just once—I thought I heard something else under it. The sharp little thunk of a cooler lid closing. The click of a lantern dial.

When I got back to the station that night, the coffee pot had boiled itself dry. The ring in the bottom took twenty minutes of scrubbing to get out.

I try not to think about the timing.

I didn’t say my name out loud in the truck on the way home.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Your barndominium, with its unique combination of rustic charm and modern living, is the perfect canvas for creative outdoor spaces. One of the standout features of a barndominium is the wrap-around porch, which offers ample opportunities to enjoy the outdoors in style. These porches not only boost the home’s curb appeal but also enhance your outdoor living experience. Here are some exciting ideas to make the most of your barndominium with a wrap-around porch.

### Cozy Gathering Spots

Creating cozy gathering spots on your wrap-around porch can make outdoor living more enjoyable. Here are some ideas:

- **Outdoor Sofas:** Choose weather-resistant sofas adorned with colorful cushions to create a welcoming nook.
- **Fire Pit:** Install a small, portable fire pit to encourage family gatherings on chilly evenings.
- **Hammocks:** Hang a hammock or two, perfect for lazy afternoons or restful moments with a book.

### Functional Dining Areas

Eating outdoors can become a delightful experience with a well-designed dining area. Consider the following aspects when setting up your space:

- **Dining Table:** Select a sturdy, outdoor dining table that complements your barndominium’s rustic theme.
- **Outdoor Kitchen:** If space allows, incorporate a small outdoor kitchen or grill station for summer barbecues.
- **Lighting:** Use string lights or lanterns to provide ambiance during evening meals.

### Decorative Elements

Styling your wrap-around porch can elevate its charm. Here are some decorative elements to consider:

- **Planters:** Place large planters filled with vibrant flowers or greenery at strategic points to enhance natural beauty.
- **Rugs:** An outdoor rug can define your seating area and add a splash of color.
- **Artwork:** Hang weather-resistant art pieces or hand-painted signs that reflect your personality and style.

### Functional Storage Solutions

Maximize the potential of your wrap-around porch with clever storage solutions:

- **Storage Benches:** Use benches with built-in storage for cushions and outdoor games.
- **Cabinets:** Install cabinets or open shelves for easy access to tools, gardening supplies, or grilling accessories.
- **Hooks:** Install hooks for hanging items like hats, bags, or even outdoor lights.

### Shade and Shelter Features

To enjoy your porch even in varied weather conditions, consider adding features for shade and shelter:

- **Retractable Awnings:** These can extend during the hottest months to provide shade, then retract when not needed.
- **Ceiling Fans:** Install ceiling fans to keep the air circulating on hot days.
- **Outdoor Curtains:** Use waterproof curtains to create a cozy, private space that also shields from wind and rain.

Don't forget about your personal touch! Add elements that resonate with your family's lifestyle. If you have kids, consider incorporating a play area on one section of the porch. For pet owners, add a pet nook complete with a comfy bed and toys. The wrap-around porch is an extension of your living space, and it’s important that it reflects your interests and lifestyle.

With stunning views, plenty of room for entertaining, and a breath of fresh air, a wrap-around porch on your barndominium offers endless possibilities. By blending functionality with creativity, you can transform this space into your favorite destination right at home. Embrace the charm of outdoor living, and enjoy every moment spent in your beautiful barndominium.

Designing Functional Spaces: How a Wrap Around Porch Enhances Your Barndominium Experience
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding a wrap-around porch to your barndominium can be a game-changer. Not only does it elevate the aesthetic appeal of your home, but it also enhances the functional aspects of your living space. This design feature can bring a variety of benefits, making your home feel more spacious and connected to nature.

Imagine stepping out of your kitchen or living room onto a wide porch that wraps around to greet the fresh air. This setting not only provides a seamless transition from indoors to outdoors but also maximizes your available space. Here's how a wrap-around porch can enhance your barndominium experience:

- **Extended Living Space:** A wrap-around porch offers extra room for lounging, reading, or even dining outside. This allows you to enjoy your surroundings in a comfortable setting, giving you more space to entertain family and friends.
- **Exposure to Nature:** Being surrounded by nature can boost your mood and reduce stress. The open layout encourages natural light and fresh air to flow into your home, promoting a healthier living environment.
- **Versatile Design Options:** From cozy seating arrangements to dining areas adorned with string lights, the porch can be customized to fit your lifestyle. You can choose furniture and decor that reflect your personal style and the setting’s natural beauty.
- **Ideal for Social Gatherings:** Whether it’s a summer barbecue or a quiet evening with loved ones, a wrap-around porch serves as an inviting space for social gatherings. You can easily set up for entertainment and enjoy casual conversations in a relaxed atmosphere.
- **Protection from the Elements:** A wide porch provides shelter from sun and rain, allowing you to enjoy outdoor activities regardless of the weather. This means you can sip your morning coffee outside even when the sun is blazing, or stay dry when caught in a light drizzle.

When you consider the layout of your barndominium, think about how the direction of the porch can affect your daily life. A well-placed wrap-around porch can capture the best views of your property while providing a buffer against wind and rain. For example, if you live in a windy area, orienting the porch towards a sheltered side of the home can make it more enjoyable to use year-round.

Another functional aspect of the wrap-around porch lies in its accessibility. For families, easy access to the outdoors is essential. You can create pathways from various rooms that lead right to the porch. This makes it easier for kids to play outside while parents keep an eye on them from inside. Similarly, for those with mobility issues, having a porch that connects multiple entries provides a safer way to navigate the home.

It’s important to think about design elements that can enhance your wrap-around porch further. Consider adding built-in seating for comfort and convenience. You could even include storage solutions for outdoor cushions and games. This helps keep the area neat and inviting. Additionally, integrating planters or flower boxes into your porch design can create a more vibrant atmosphere and draw nature closer to your living space.

Lighting is another key factor in maximizing the use of your porch. Installing outdoor lighting can extend your time spent outside, allowing you to enjoy evenings under the stars. From string lights to lanterns, the right lighting can create a magical ambiance, making your wrap-around porch a favorite gathering spot.

In terms of aesthetic appeal, a wrap-around porch can be complemented with different materials, such as wood, composite decking, or stone. Your choice will depend on your personal preferences and the overall look you want for your barndominium. Don’t forget to add some décor that resonates with your taste, like outdoor rugs, cushions, and art pieces.

As you design your wrap-around porch, think about the way it connects with the rest of your property. It should enhance the flow between indoor and outdoor spaces, allowing for easy movement and interaction with your surroundings.

A wrap-around porch into your barndominium not only enhances functionality but also creates a unique space where you can unwind and connect with nature. This design feature can become one of the most cherished areas of your home, blending comfort, style, and practicality.

### Conclusion

A wrap-around porch is more than just an aesthetic addition to your barndominium; it's an extension of your living space that enhances your enjoyment of the outdoors. With creative ideas such as cozy seating nooks, outdoor dining areas, and stylish planters, you can transform this space into your personal retreat. Imagine sipping your morning coffee amidst the gentle rustle of leaves or hosting family barbecues with ample room for everyone to gather and share stories.

The functional aspects of a wrap-around porch cannot be overstated. It not only provides shelter from sun and rain but also creates flow between your indoor and outdoor environments. By designing accessible spaces that blend seamlessly with your home, you invite nature in while enhancing your overall living experience. For instance, think about incorporating a swing or hammock for casual relaxation or a fire pit area for those cool evenings when you want to unwind under the stars.

Embracing these elements can significantly enhance your barndominium's charm and usability. As you map out your design ideas, consider how a wrap-around porch can cater to your lifestyle and the activities you love.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Episode 7 really kicked off the finale vibe with the sudden (but well understood and savvy) flashback with Bobert and Chase younger years. Young Robert’s dialogue choices in this scene had meaning in every choice you picked, Twinkies self-explanatory, but the cigar and beer one just reinforces what robert said to chase said in Ep.6 about “you stealing shit for me”. The scene with blazer and current robert being at chase’s bedside with Robert’s sheer determination to not break, and blazer’s comical corporate attitude not being present stood out to me. 

Waterboy’s angry disposition, Bob-Bob’s brotherly reassurance, and the vending machine reaction right after just screamed iconic (as much as I hate that word, this scene and many others I mention and hopefully don’t forget, embody). Once we actually get to the [TITLE CARD] part of the episode, you could just taste the fucking somberness of everyone from the foreground dialogue to the deflated (and deferent, as far as the usual snarky team members don’t give Robert the usual ballbusting) throwaway dialogue. And personally, I made sure I aced each and every call to integrate the gameplay and story to show “we are going to do our job immaculately FOR CHASE!” 

In that background dialogue during the gameplay, maleovla, punch up and others mentioned booking a room, which after the dispatch part was done, we got to see Robert stumble onto a team vote of cutting Courtney or letting her stay. Punch Up’s response to all your choices, deserves many mentions, as he either takes the blame for golem throwing him out the door, or offering to pay for the damages, which showed development and self-awareness of how intense he felt abt the visi situation. Robert makes his decision (I picked to keep her) which showed an obvious negative effect on the team (and I guess it’s a scare for players who don’t wanna let the majority down and affect the gameplay going forward but I’ll get into that when I talk about episode 8). Robert and Courtney (I went her romance route) talk, Courtney admits, Robert forgives, they get spicy etc. ya’ll played the episode and saw a semi-pay off for episode 4’s intro lol

Cut to Robert telling BB to credit Chase’s actions in a media session, go to the bar, be civil and a little curt with the bartender and outright hyper self control yourself, and BOOM shroud wham episodes the hell outta the bartender, coupe makes her return and we see a torture scene akin to a Hollywood grade masterpiece. Mandy comes to the rescue in a first of many Big Damn Hero moments in these episode drops. LA goes through hellfire (yet again, but as an LA native i’ll spare the analysis and symbolism LMAO), and both Robert and Blonde Blazer bro-forearm-shake to get their city back. 

Episode 8 starts off with the calm before the shit openings.  At this point, I’m pacing in front of my tv while mr whiskers goes through his spiked coffee routine, and before I know it, Royd starts dispatching (been there before in food service where I had to man the grill and work the register ((don’t tell the health department)) when shit’s hit the fan, and Robert’s only having a low morale prism and punch up, with a drugged up golem to round out my paltry roster. No synergy and these next few calls are 2 and 3 slots, and I’m lucky my gummi boy golem has his spread thin power up. Slowly but surely, Malevola turns on her phone, invisigal shows up to everyone’s surprise and resentment, we save Flambé, sonar and waterboy. Full squad babyyy. 1st cutscene, and we rally Phenomamamamaman from his melon prescribed depression and I remember why I never picked up him up in chapter 4. Quick turnaround after a call is nice, but I was running a shit show with failed calls left and right so I barely got to use him. After running a dispatch of phenomaman and sonar against coupe, I brought her health bar significantly down, and cue the 2nd cutscene.

In real life, that strategy of staying where you are to answer potential calls in the area is a sound one, but my dumbass was still trying to run synergy line ups that I’ve been doing the first 6 episodes, but watching the icons of my team crawl to their destination really fucked up my strategy as coupe was able to quickly bring down the Torrance health bar by the time my punch up/waterboy and sonar/malevola combos were able to even start their cupcake calls. And my golem was used and abused for what I realize were the most mundane calls in the game. Katon-Ur was going thru his 5th meltdown of the game, and my random squad up of invisigal/prism was about to fail their 26% call…when the bouncy ball gets miraculously pushed by BLONDE BLAZERRR!  It’s quite a stir to see a BIG DAMN HEROES moment in a UI setting, but that shit fucking sent me thru the moon. Seeing her be a shining beacon helped me rally to crush the rest of my calls, and fix my strat of bringing coupe down, despite those annoying “mobility but not too much mobility” auto fail calls. This far into my ramblings, I wish I screenshot some of these moments to post here but the “one last push” one I regret the most not documenting: my poetry lineup of Blonde Blazer, Sonar, Invisigal, and Punch Up really Gave It Everything They Got 🧑‍🍳 💋, and clutched it with 5% of Torrance to spare.

BLACK OUT 
next scene enter Robert and Royd running thru the corridors for Chase, and the Mecha Man suit respectively. Chase and Beef are a synergy line up that we all deserve. Cut to Robert going to the lab with Royd randomly but sadly expressing his disappointment with Visi and Robert has to make some critical decisions here. Thumb stick and his coke nails runs thru the hallway to water the fern between the bio break rooms, and Visi fucks him up in her own little damn hero moment. Robert validated mr.sticks pants for uniform acceptability and Visi pulls a Batman (sonar still best bat boi). Robert has his “ahh that feels MUCH better” ahh moment with the Astro pulse and the mecha suit. Cut to Royd kicking ass, and Mecha Man rising from the depths of hell to join the fight. Blah blah blah green dick and off shoot doc-ock-fo join the fight, and then here comes Shroud from the spiderverse (so 2022 of you shroud 🙃) to start the endgame. 

Blows are exchanged, Robert not really having an advantage, “Blonde Blazer” shows up, just as a foreshadowing and followed by the Z team having their own (do I even need to say it??)…arrival and this just evens the odds. Or so we think. Spider-shroud immediately dials in on the attack patterns of our new arrivals and incapacitates them, culminating on some Infinity War type shit with Blonde Blazer and Mecha Man on the ropes. All is lost until Chase admittedly deus ex machina’d shroud and his power source from being bestowed Mandy’s amulet to become star lazer. But even if the timing and effectiveness was a little ham fisted, WE UP NOWWWWW! 

Once Peter Elliot collins Parker tempts fate by talking shit a final time, we see our beloved Z-listers become impeccable, cohesive and become a real fucking team on screen. Every single one applies pressure on shroud in their unique way, culminating in a Kamehameha wave that reverberated throughout realities. 

Shroud deserves no mercy for what he tried to do. He pulled his own bullshit by somehow acquisitions ing Beef and using him as leverage to get the pulse back He deserves to die. But the way my Robert is composed, he’s going to get a lot worse than that. He gives Shroud both the prototype and the real deal. A fitting consequence for shroud considering what decisions, analysis and luck farming the PLAYER had to do to get to this point. Now it’s Elliot’s turn to take his chances like we had to do, and he fucking blows it in front SDN, the Red Ring and Mecha Man. Some genius he is. Even as I said he deserved to die, I showed him mercy. I wanted that murderous and hypocritical dick to think on how he lost so hard even with his fortune telling Christmas light set up, and break his damn ego (and face) into a million pieces. 

I can go on and on about the ending scenes with Visi being hauled away, our debrief with Mandy and welcoming coop/sonar back to the team and the ensuing scenes but right now, I think you guys get the point and I want people to actually read and comment, so just know that this game gave me hope and inspiration in my own life, and it deserves GOTY.

Because she was giving me attitude, and I work remotely, I asked if she has Venmo. Was going to send her 20 dollars for coffee or whatever.

If I do die, please forget I existed.

    I’m a private detective; my name is henry. I’ve spent the last thirteen years hunting other people’s monsters. 

    The psychos with hallucinations, delusions, and psychotic breaks, whatever you want to call the things that crawl out of a guilty mind and take shape in violent situations against another person. 

    As a detective, I’ve seen some cases that make psychiatry look like child's play. But it wasn’t until the Henderson case, the one with the thing I still don’t fully understand or want even to believe is real. But what that old man was dealing with was something too familiar, and I started noticing the signs in my own life. The voice that whispers my name when I’m alone. The scent of my brother’s cologne in rooms I haven’t entered. I thought it was just stress or the late nights catching up with me. Now I’m not so sure he ever really died. 

    I don’t remember the exact day weird things began to happen, but it was about three years ago. 

    Small stuff like glasses of water on the table, half-drunk, that I never filled or even moved out of the cabinet. I convinced myself that this was just a result of my overwhelming lack of sleep. For a long time, it was just that relatively small shit, nothing truly special. Then, about nine months ago, things gradually became more unusual, such as steam on the bathroom mirror, as if someone had taken a shower right before I arrived home. 

    There’s one night that sticks out to me a lot in a sinister way. 

    After a night of deep sleep, which was great, I had a long day following scum trails of our county’s latest serial killer. A woman had a little evidence leading to a man who was last seen bringing old army bags into a drain tunnel. 

    And I was who she hired to find her nephews' kidnapper and murderer. 

    Some of her neighbors who live near the tunnel said they had heard and seen the man enter the tunnel multiple nights in a row. One of the neighbors actually took a video of him, and he seemed to have multiple full backpacks, one in his hand and on his back. I went down and started searching the area, where I found some possessions belonging to six other missing people, aged between nineteen and thirty-two. After about 24 yards into the tunnel, I found these belongings, which were somewhat jammed between some bars leading to another tunnel. After that, I took photos and collected a few items, and brought them to the police station, where police and detectives were working on the full case behind this man.

     I was pretty tired after all this, and so I headed home for the day. I took off my shoes and headed to the kitchen. The air smelled like rye bread and a faint hint of patchouli. That’s two things my brother would have. It was a fresh loaf of rye baking, and his favorite cologne on, anytime a family member or a new girl came to his house. But there was neither of those things in mine. So I'm unsure how they were present at the time. But the most terrifying part was, I swear, I heard his voice, and he asked me if I would like an Italian-style sandwich when the bread is done. At this moment, my skin had started entirely to crawl, and I needed to cry. The urge to cry was unbearable. I started to bawl my eyes harder than I did when I heard of his passing, and I can’t accept it.
I didn’t even understand how I could then, years after. And as my eyes were so full of tears and I could only see smudges of the room around me, the oven door popped open slightly on its own. Just enough for the light to turn on, the smell and presence of my brother and his delicious bread disappeared.

     I ended up just watching TV that night, not worrying about my work I still had to do. I ended up just watching TV that whole night. I fell asleep to the movie 50 First Dates, or is it Dates with Adam Sandler? After that night, though, things got way worse. Things like hearing him say stuff, stuff that will never leave my being, things that are gonna stay embedded in me for eternity. I began to see his shoes at the bottom of my steps, or his sunglasses in my cup holder as I open my car door, and they vanish once I’m seated.

     Recently, though, since I met a man with a last name Henderson, I started to feel like I might actually be in danger. Especially after I was able to tell Henderson what I believed he had in his home. 

    The day I met him was pretty normal. I got to my office and answered a call. Henderson said he found a person in his home. He told me on the phone that he wanted me to see him and that he hadn't reported it to the police. Then I drove the shortest way to his house and stepped out onto his doorstep. I knocked. He answered, but his response was marked by a look of disconnectedness. He hadn't looked aware of his surroundings. I entered the house at his request, and we started a discussion. This is the recording I made on my phone.

 Henderson-(I would like to tell you it sounds crazy)

Me-” I have heard enough crazy to follow along”

(ok)
(I was coming home from work, and I saw him for the first time in 6 years, my son, who died of cancer)

“What is his name?”

(Ryan)
(so I started, eh, uhm, I cried, I didn't know what to do, my eyes just watered) 

(I saw him sitting in my car when I was walking to it, but he disappeared at some point) 

“It’s ok, sir, take your time. “ I would like to ask you about how your son pa-“ I was cut off by his voice in an indifferent tone.

(My son was a part of a peculiar group of individuals who played a weird tabletop game, which is what he told me, but the journal he left behind was something I couldn’t show the police.)

“So your showing me”

(Yes) 
(I feel like you're not gonna have a whole department of people leaking it)

 The old man pulled out the journal; it has a snake on the front, and it’s pressed into the leather.

The way the book is made appears familiar, with the use of leather and the stitching around the border. My brother had one with a crow on it, the same style book with crazy shit inside of it. Writings about controlling the entire world by enslaving masses and bringing something called the beyond to life, so it could make everything in the way it sees it, really focused on the visual of the world. He wanted to change it, and his journal was his way of explaining the twisted and corrupt way he would do so. 

“How many of these journals do you know of?”
I immediately think that was stupid because I was now interested in the book and the group of people he mentioned.

“I’m not sure, but he had a friend he visited often, whose name is David. He lives in the Gates community in the orange house next to the gate.”

“What has been happening in your home recently, you told me on the phone, “about a person in your house.”

(Oh no. I must have been mistaken; it was just my mind playing tricks on me. You know I’m still grieving my son; he was only twenty-four. 

(I swear I saw his legs behind me in the reflection on the stove and heard him ask about taking him to his study for an exam) 

(But he’s been dead for a while, and I called you before I got ready to go out to get coffee) 

“That’s awful, I’m sorry you're going through this stuff in your own home,” cut off again, but in a terrified but gradually pissed off tone

(That’s that, not it got worse, used dishes, plates, and dirty knives, and rotten food in the fridge, my basement was flooded from having laundry I never saw before overflowing my washer) 

“Mr Henderson, I can get you a place to stay for a few months. It’s a rental home.” 
(I don’t need that) 
(I was hoping you could find the people who murdered my son) 

“A few more questions about the people he was last seen with and the places he frequents.”

(He worked seven hours, five days a week)
(And after work one day, he went out with two of his friends and was never seen again) 

“What’s the address to your son’s job so I can go see if they have anything to help?” he quickly writes it down.

(You're taking all this very differently than I expected)
“I’ve seen and heard a lot, sir.”
“I would like to take the journal if that ok for findings, it might have places or people in it to help find his murderer.” 

(Yes, you can take what you need as long as you can get justice done; the police are not fast enough.) 

“Alright, Mr Henderson, I’ll be going to his job tomorrow morning.”
“Hopefully, I’ll find his friends he went with.”

    As I was walking to my car, Henderson told me to drive carefully, there's always a chance of rain. As soon as I got inside my house, I felt something was off. I was dizzy and tried to get to my couch to sit, but then I started seeing things from my brother's journal start flashing on the walls: strange drawings and articles in a foreign language I couldn’t read. I saw him sitting, and he said I would soon know what it all meant. I need to follow him. 

I made it to the couch and saw a candle matching one in the book from Ryan on my TV stand. I felt incredibly uncomfortable, so I grabbed my pistol from my jeans and held it. I was so sure someone had broken into my house and was playing with me, but after a moment, when I started to zone out, it all disappeared again. All I could smell, though, was pachouli cologne. 

    I actually fell asleep before midnight, surprisingly. When I woke up in the morning, I went to the diner and ate, then headed straight to the plastic factory where Ryan worked. Soon, as I entered, I knew I was at just the right place and began walking to the counter. And from that point, shit became way worse for me. Way worse than ever before.

**The lazy weekend started with the sound of rain.**

**It was a gray, quiet Saturday, the kind of day that gives you permission to do nothing at all. The confrontation with my mother had been five days ago. The fallout had been... silent. No calls. No texts. Not from her, not from my dad, not even from Mark. The ""easy"" son had finally unplugged the phone, and the silence was as terrifying as it was liberating.**

**But in our apartment, the silence was a different quality. It was rich. It was a blanket.**

**I woke up first, tangled in the sheets and Silas. He was a furnace, radiating a steady heat. I watched him sleep for a moment**… **the harsh lines of his face were gone, making him look younger. The ""intellectual sweetheart"" was on full display.**

**I slipped out of bed, pulled on a t-shirt, and padded to the kitchen. The plan was simple: pancakes. Slow pancakes.**

**By the time I was setting out the flour and eggs, Silas emerged, scrubbing his face with one hand. He grunted a ""mornin'"" that was more of a vibration, poured his coffee, and then... didn't go to his chair.**

**He sat at the kitchen table and pulled a small, mangled object out of the ""junk"" drawer. Our toaster. It had been sparking for a week.**

**I mixed the batter. He disassembled the toaster.**

**The kitchen filled with the smell of coffee and the sound of rain tapping the window, punctuated by the click-click of a small screwdriver.**

**""You know we can just... buy a new one,"" I said, pouring the first pancake onto the griddle.**

**""No,"" Silas grumbled, his brow furrowed in concentration. ""It's not the element. It's the spring. The latch is bent.""**

**He was in his element. A problem. A logical, mechanical problem that could be solved. He was in his sweatpants, hair a mess, waging a one-man war against a  50 dollar appliance.**

**""God, I love you,"" I said, smiling at the back of his head.**

**""Hmm,"" he replied, which was Silas-speak for ""I know, and I love you, too, now be quiet, I'm working.""**

**I flipped the pancake. It was a perfect, golden-brown. I felt a small, domestic thrill. I, the former ""chameleon,"" was just... happy. I wasn't performing. I wasn't anticipating anyone's needs. I was just making breakfast for my partner, who was fixing our toaster.**

**He let out a small, satisfied ""hah!"" He re-assembled the toaster, plugged it in, and dropped in a slice of bread. After a minute, it shot up with a loud THWACK, landing perfectly on the counter.**

**""Problem. Solved,"" he announced, looking absurdly proud.**

**""You're a hero,"" I said, sliding a stack of pancakes onto a plate for him.**

**We ate at the table, the rain lashing the glass. We didn't talk much. We didn't need to. We just ate, and the quiet between us was as comfortable as an old sweater.**

**The afternoon was even lazier. The rain turned from a drumbeat to a steady, hypnotic shush. The whole city felt muffled.**

**I grabbed a book I'd been meaning to read. Silas, of course, was already in his armchair, Dostoevsky open on his lap.**

**This was the part where I'd normally curl up on the couch. But I didn't.**

**I walked over to his chair. He looked up, his expression questioning. I didn't say anything. I just nudged his legs, sat down on the ottoman at his feet, and leaned back against his knees.**

**He was so solid. A living, breathing mountain.**

**He let me settle, then rested his book on my head, as if I were a small table.**

**""Rude,"" I mumbled, my voice vibrating against his shins.**

**""You're in my light,"" he rumbled back.**

**He shifted. I felt him move, and then his large hand was on my shoulder, pulling me up. ""Get... no. C'mere.""**

**He yanked. I yelped, tumbling sideways. He rearranged his large frame, pulling me into the armchair with him. It was a tight fit. I was half-sprawled across his chest, my back against one arm of the chair, my legs tangled with his. It was awkward and undignified and absolutely perfect.**

**""This is better,"" he decided, his voice a low vibration against my ear.**

**He settled his arm around my waist, pulling me securely against his side. He was warm, solid, and he smelled like coffee and soap.**

**""Can you read like this?"" I asked, my head tucked under his chin.**

**""Yeah,"" he said. ""Just be quiet.""**

**So we were. We sat in the big armchair for what must have been two hours. The rain fell. The apartment was quiet. He read his book about Russian philosophy, and I read my book about a detective, and our breathing slowly fell into the same rhythm.**

**This was it. This was the ""heaven"" we'd talked about. The ""static"" in his head was so quiet it was nonexistent. He wasn't a witch, he was just Si. And the ""waiter"" in my head was on a permanent vacation. I wasn't a chameleon. I was just Asa.**

**""Si?"" I whispered, later.**

**""Hmm?""**

**""Is it... is it quiet for you? Right now?""**

**His hand, which was resting on my ribs, tightened just a fraction.**

**""It's not quiet,"" he murmured, his lips moving against my hair. ""It's... clear. Like a single, low note. Before, it was a thousand radios. Now... it's just one. It's you.""**

**I closed my eyes, my heart feeling too big for my chest.**

**""I'm not rehearsing,"" I whispered back.**

**""What?""**

**""In my head. I'm not... rehearsing what I'm going to say. I'm not worried about what you're thinking. I'm just... here.""**

**""Good,"" he said. ""Stay here.""**

**We eventually ordered pizza, too comfortable to move and too lazy to cook. We ate it cold, straight from the box, still tangled up in the armchair, while the rain finally stopped and the city lights began to glow in the wet dark.**

**He took a piece of crust from my hand and ate it.**

**""You're a paradox, you know,"" I said, looking up at him in the dim light. ""Sophisticated redneck. Intellectual sweetheart.""**

**""And you're a chameleon,"" he replied, his voice soft. ""But you're not invisible. You're the brightest damn thing in the room.""**

**He kissed me then. A slow, lazy, pizza-crust-and-coffee-flavored kiss that tasted like a Saturday with no plans.**

**""You're home, Ace,"" he whispered, pressing his forehead against mine. ""You're finally home.""**

**""No,"" I corrected, closing my eyes and breathing him in. ""We are.""**",1,1763184816.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

My wisdom teeth are fine, but apparently I have cavities in my back molars. I have had some pain there occasionally, but thought nothing of it.

So I said to myself ""I would try to eat less sugar, until I get them filled."" Over the course of a week I have noticed that I usually eat, at least two or three sugary things a day. Whether that be a cup of soda, ice cream or cake. I even add sugar to non sugary items, I make my coffee with hot chocolate packets and extra creamer, and whenever I have fries, I get a scoop of ice cream.

I noticed this and tried to cold turkey the sugar. I only lasted 2 days, and I felt miserable. When I tried to go to sleep I couldn't and I didn't finish my meals. I have stopped buying sweet stuff and my fridge looks empty.

Earlier today, I was eating some mid cake, and thought ""I have cavities, I should throw this out"" and then I thought of something else I could eat. When I thought of something, I just made up excuses on why I should continue eating the cake. Chicken wings? No, takes too long to cook, and the cake is right here.

I just want to know how to stop it. Am I doomed to dentures, or is this curable?",1,1763184763.0,askanything,0,1.0,False

•	⁠profitec go
•	⁠DF 64 Gen 2 grinder
•	⁠MHW-3bomber accessories: self-leveling tamper, milk pitcher (I know they’re not that good value, I just need something decent for cheaper than normcore prices because this setup is already expensive for me)
•	⁠Acaia lunar (I know I’ll want one eventually so biting the bullet now)
•	⁠some random WDT on amazon where the needles are spread out adequately enough
•	⁠normcore 18g basket
•	⁠ecm bottomless portafilter

I plan on making 1 milk drink per day + a simple espresso, but I couldn’t care less about an extra couple minutes that a single boiler takes to get ready for milk steaming. Am I underestimating just how long it will take to make a milk drink with a single boiler? I’m willing to wait around an extra 2-3 minutes. And before you say “get the Breville bambino plus!” I only drink fresh light roasted coffee. I want the PID, and I want to have control over the water I use.

Is there anything I am missing? Would you suggest any changes? It would be nice not to go up in price from what I’m spending right now, and I would like to keep this setup for a long time. I was considering getting a BDB, but honestly think it’s really ugly and am not sure I want to spend over 2000 dollars on that.

1oxjk24,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxjk24,MoMs Horchata & Mazapán Combo (Recommended by u/miggy07),"I forgot to post this earlier today; but I did end up trying the Horchata Cold Brew* with Mazapán at MoMs. This was recommended in a previous post by u/miggy07 (thank you for the recommendation). I would like to note the Horchata Cold Brew =/= Horchata as a disclaimer. Additionally if you have any nut or peanut allergies; I would NOT recommend this drink combination for you.

To “make” this drink you would have to order the Horchata Cold Brew, which is $4.75. Additionally to add the Mazapán; it costs $0.25 for one. You would also have to crumble it ontop of the drink yourself. So in total this drink would cost $5.00.

If you were expecting a drink that is similar to Horchata; I would say the Horchata Cold Brew is a distant relative. I don’t think you should get this drink expecting it to taste like an horchata; however you do taste the cold brew and some notes of cinnamon in the drink. It might just be my tastes; but this drink tastes a little sour to me. I think it’s probably just how the Cold Brew tastes. When adding the Mazapán onto the cold brew (I’ve only added one); you can taste some notes of peanuts and sugar. The drink does get a little sweeter. However the cold brew mostly overpowers most of the flavor the Mazapán would have on its own. The Mazapán does mostly dissolve in the drink; though there can be some chunks, so mix well.

I personally don’t think this drink is for me. I probably think it’s because the cold brew isn’t something that I personally prefer. I feel like certain people will like this drink and certain people will not; it doesn’t hurt to try it. Additionally, if you wanted to find a drink that tasted more like Mazapán; you can order an existing drink (the Mazapán Cappuccino) which is also served at MoMs.

Thank you u/miggy07 for the recommendation. Even though it wasn’t something for me; I enjoyed trying something new and trying out different flavor combinations.",5,1763184654.0,UCSD,1,0.86,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **George Mason Patriots vs. New Hampshire Wildcats: A Lopsided Lob or a Last-Minute Lark?**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball game that’s about as competitive as a toddler’s tic-tac-toe match. On paper, the George Mason Patriots (3-0) are favored by **22.5 points** over the New Hampshire Wildcats (2-2), a spread so wide it could fit a limo, a minivan, and a guy in a squirrel costume trying to escape. Let’s unpack why this game might be less “March Madness” and more “March Mathness.”

### Parse the Odds: The Patriots Are Cooking with Gas

George Mason’s dominance starts with their **71.2 PPG average** and a paint-scorching offense that slams 30.4 points in the post. Last season, they went 27-9 overall, and their 2025 squad has already flexed with a 86-62 dismantling of Catawba, where Jahari Long dropped 25 points like confetti at a parade. The Wildcats? They’re a team that allowed **12.3 turnovers per game last season** and averaged a meager 5.7 steals. It’s like watching a sieve try to hold water during a hurricane—charming in theory, catastrophic in practice.

The spread of **-22.5** for George Mason implies bookmakers expect the Patriots to win by roughly the same margin as the average Netflix user’s willpower during a “Just One Episode” bender. Converting the decimal odds (1.91-1.94) to implied probabilities gives Mason a **51.5-52% chance** to cover the spread, which, in betting terms, is about as risky as betting your coffee order won’t get messed up at a drive-thru.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Home-Court Advantage, and a Team with Nothing to Lose

George Mason’s recent win over Catawba was a clinic in efficiency—**30.4 points in the paint**, **15 points off turnovers**—and they’re playing at **EagleBank Arena**, where they averaged **77.1 PPG last season**. No major injuries reported, and with a home-court edge, they’re basically hosting a basketball block party.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1oxjdos,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiddenTrueCrimeChat/comments/1oxjdos/lauren_matthias_mormon_stories_interview_part_1/,"Lauren Matthias' Mormon Stories Interview (Part 1, first 30 minutes)","VIDEO HERE: [https://youtu.be/tAWqHx0wJdE?si=D\_taRnL7UB1Iazoo](https://youtu.be/tAWqHx0wJdE?si=D_taRnL7UB1Iazoo)

Things I noticed only after transcribing the first 30 minutes of the video: John Dehlin is less a neutral interviewer than he is a hype man. He is a very sympathetic co-narrator and a social validator. He plays the moral witness to her heroism. Cases can be made over how you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar. No one wants to open up to a bad cop. Except . . . he feeds her lines, which is strange. He also knows her oldest brother, Clark, which I found telling as John Dehlin forwarded an anonymous email criticizing Lauren to Lauren. Lauren later attempted to tie this email exchange to Christina (unsuccessfully) during her LAWL and CWIME vid.

John sets the tone of the video by overpraising. He immediately labels Lauren as a super-popular, world-renowned, true crime superstar. He grooms the audience perception before Lauren even utters a word. She is preemptively elite, special, and exceptional. And not one coherent sentence has yet been issued . . . dare I say *ejaculated* by the interviewee. 

I'm going to give Lauren credit for resisting modestly and believably with ""superstar is a little much."" However, this only invites further praise by Dehlin's cohost Mindy, just in case we don't believe JD's praises.

The pattern is as follows: The interviewer praises -> The guest dismisses -> The interviewer reinforces -> The guest appears humble.

Question to fans of MS: Does JD always begin every interview with a guest by calling it a ""sacred honor""? Is this a cultural thing to frame things mythically? Or is the purpose of the MS podcast image-rehabilitation on the sly? 

Anyway, Mindy chimes in with ""we miss Meeeegan,"" and other non-descript interjections that don't really add or elicit thoughtful responses from the interviewee. Comments like, ""fascinating, I love that, that's remarkable. Wow."" 

The gist is that Lauren says something to the effect of, ""I'm nervous, I don't like disappointing people,"" and JD responds with lovely adjectives that could come off as giving her permission to be vulnerable. When she is, he rewards her with more lovely praises. Granted, you might attract more flies with honey.

So the pattern is Lauren Matthias shows vulnerability -> JD praises -> JD asks Mindy if she agrees, so she is prompted to add more praises ->Lauren shares more vulnerability -> And the rest of us are like, ""WOW, the interviewee is a totally authentic, morally pure, emotionally humble, truth-telling heroine."" Who knew? 

The first 30 minutes are, I'm paraphrasing here: ""you were so precocious, conscientious, and anxiety-ridden."" JD then mentions saying this to Grayson about Lauren, to Lauren. So far, we have established that Lauren has Megan, Grayson, Dehlin, and Mindy as not just friends but fanatics.

He interprets her sometimes incoherent story for us (the pauses and stutters at the beginning could be due to nerves). JD grooms her and us in the process. Throughout the interview, JD: (1) interprets her fear; (2) names her emotional states, (3) assigns meanings to childhood events, (4) diagnoses scrupulosity or anxiety, (5) expands her narrative significance. 

He interprets her *to* his audience, and he constructs authority for both of them. He becomes the wise old-guy apostate. She becomes the complex, layered protagonist. This is a collaborative identity performance. I'm not entirely convinced that this is not a case of subconscious co-creation; that this re-framing of humble beginnings as mythic origin stories is a culturally Mormon phenomenon, since so much of what they do is bait the gentile with a compelling story, so that they keep showing up to church . . . to pay their tithes. 

In the first 30 minutes of the video, I am told that Lauren is a spiritually legitimate, morally enlightened, humble yet exceptional, globally aware, brave, precociously insightful woman whose childhood fear and ancestral heritage uniquely prepared her to humanize others and speak truth in dark places. Mind you, the childhood trauma is primarily based on the anticipation of kidnapping or death. It's literally the culture fear-mongering her into becoming more religious. Her faith becomes her safety. She couldn't even stomach atheism for a whole-ass second before immediately dominating that uncertainty with, ""My Church is true. God is real.""

Other things I noted are that she has substantial family pride. She places enormous weight on ancestors who carried people across icy rivers, Mexican colonies with the Romneys, having pioneer blood (LDS blood through and through), multigenerational faith, family sacrifice, and spiritual calling. I suppose the weight is there, anticipating that active LDS members might criticize her for criticizing the church. I also learned Mormons like writing in journals. Or rather, they're heavily motivated to do so. I can't imagine detailing my day-to-day existence. It just sounds tedious as f---k to me. Throughout, there is an excessive amount of triangulating praises, which I found odd, partly because I did not grow up in a culture where admiration is the default social reality.

TRANSCRIPT BELOW:

>`John Delin (host of Mormon Stories/interviewer):  [. . . ] I’ve been waiting for years for this interview, but we have with us, in studio, back for those familiar with Mormon Stories. We have Lauren Matthias to tell us her epic story of how she went from a young woman raised Mormon to the super popular world-renowned Hidden True Crime podcast with her husband Dr. John; and Lauren. We’re so happy to have you. What do you think, Mindy?`

>`Mindy: True Crime Superstar.`

>`John Delin: Absolutely. Great description. And if ya’ll don’t know we have Mindy Caldwell back as my cohost for today. Hey Mindy!`

>`Mindy: So happy to be here.`

>`John Delin: Yeah, I think - us- combined with Meegan are maybe best known in the Mormon Stories Family for our coverage of ‘Visions of Glory,’ Chad Daybell, Lori Vallow, Jody Hildebrandt, Ruby Frankie. We’ve covered a lot of those stories, which you’ve also covered on the Hidden True Crime podcast, but I guess we have to say, ‘we love you Meegan! Is that fair to say as well?` 

>`Lauren: Yes! (smile)`

>`Mindy (MC): We miss Meegan. The Band doesn’t feel the same without Meegan.` 

>`John Delin (JD): So, we got part of the band back together, but uh, anyway. All right. So um, um anything that I = you want to add, take away, or correct from my intro, Lauren?`

>`Lauren Matthias: No.. I-I - you know, superstar is a little much, but a True Crime Podcaster - yes.` 

>`JD: Yeah, And I think that the titles that you - that we kind of brainstormed in the outline - you know - sort of like, how true crime has interplayed with your - you know - Mormon upbringing and your Mormon faith. Yeah. Just kind of your epic Mormon journey. And that’s what we do on Mormon Stories is long form. And, I’ll just let people know the current tentative plan. We always try and go with how the interview is going - is probably a two parter - uh, on this episode, because there’s so much good stuff. So, Part One is going to be Lauren Matthias’ background leading up to her decision to start the Hidden True Crime Podcast. So, that’s kind of all about her background. And then, depending on how it goes, we’ll have a Part Two, which is sort of the beginnings of Hidden True Crime Podcast. It’s evolution. And you know, where things are today: what it’s been like to cover so many important true crime stories, many of which are within a Mormon context, and then maybe some Q&A at the end. So that’s kind of the rough plan and the outline. Does that sound good?`

>`Lauren: Sound good. Sounds good. I’ll just get comfy and yeah.` 

>`JD: So let’s all settle in. You ready, Mindy?`

>`MC: I”m ready.`

>`JD: All right. Let’s do it. So, Lauren Matthias, where does your Mormon story begin?`

>`Lauren: Well, I guess it begins before I was born, right? My ancestors. But I do want to say this before I even start talking [about] why I'm doing this. You asked me, a long time ago - and yeah - you've asked me if I've ever wanted to do this. And I thought, you know what? I don't think so. Like, it just felt a little overwhelming. People have expectations of who I am, and I don't want my podcast - Hidden True Crime - I don't want to tell people what I believe. Or I don't tell people where I am because I just want to relay the evidence. Non-biasly. And, while I'll - I'll share about having an LDS background - that's all I will say in order to let them know I am relaying the evidence and nothing . . more . . or, the knowledge they need to have - you know - about the LDS faith that I . . know of because I cover a lot of . . LDS-centered crimes.` 

>`And, uh, yet as a reporter and a journalist . . for over a decade: 15 years, I have encouraged people to tell their stories because I do believe that stories change . . us (?) They change humanity. They humanize people(?) Uh, which is . . actually . . the opposite of crime. A crime is a de– Crime is a dehumanization of people. And . . it's so important to humanize people. And I think that stories and what Mormon Stories does . . is so powerful because stories change our minds . . and our . . ideas, and that's important to me. And so, I was just at the Lori Vallow-Daybell's . . . third. Third? Fourth? Third trial (nods to herself).  There's been so many. And uh . . a couple came up to me and said they watched Hidden True Crime . . . and said how much they had loved one of my particular interviews. And said that they had watched it three times. And I said: really? All three parts? Cause this was a very long interview. And they said: “all three parts. Please tell her she is . . very brave, and I'm so grateful that she was brave.”` 

>`And I think that was ‘the moment,’ and I - and I did tell the interviewee that. And I shared that with her and that was the moment I realized I think it's time that . . I should . . maybe try to be brave. (smiling) And so, that's when I reached out, and said: I'm ready! So I just want to lay that out: why I'm doing this. I-I am nervous because I don't like disappointing people. And, um, so I think about that. I think about expectations people have of me and what they might learn about me, but I also want to own my story and . . . um . . rather than . . . [never finishes the thought] Yeah. Just, just, just be authentic. (shrugs; chin juts, gaze drifts down and to the side)`

>`JD: Yeah. It's beautiful. What a beautiful intention. (00:06:24) And uh, I am so super confident that we're just going to have a great time and a heart felt uh . . . connecting time as friends! And I'm excited to learn about your story.`

>`Lauren: Thank You. (smiles)`

>`JD: Because you've made a big difference in a lot of people's lives and in ours and, uhhh, it's kind of a sacred honor to be a part of this. So..`

>`MC: Absolutely.` 

>`JD: So now, well, that’s a great intention. I guess what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, right? Where does your Mormon story begin?`

>`Lauren: So, uh, my mother is from the East Idaho area. That's where she was actually born in Hollywood, California, but she grew up in East Idaho. And uh, my grandfather, there, her father was a chiropractor and a bishop in Pocatello. And then my father is from Arizona. He was born in Casa Grande, mostly raised in Oregon though. And . . long line of LDS ancestors on both sides. While my grandmother, my dad's mom was a convert. Other than that, um: Paces, Johnsons, uh people being baptized in Kirtland. One of my great, great grandmothers on my mother's side has a painting in the St. George Temple of her carrying, uh, you know, legend has it, hundreds of people across the icy Platt River to save souls. People ask, ""Well where were the men?"" I said: they were getting owned by my grandma.` 

>`JD: (chuckles)`

>`Lauren: (smiles) And then, um, I think, and then on my dad's side I even have some that actually were in the Mexican colony - I think, with the Romneys. I mean, there, there's a wide range, but I am, I am LDS blood through and through. (08:14) And then, IIII–My parents met at BYU. That’s how you meet. And then I was born in New York City while my dad was attending Columbia Law School. I was a mistake. They already had two boys in a very small apartment in New York City. And so, um, I came along. So, I had two older brothers. Then we lived in Brooklyn for a while. My dad practiced. And then the family actually moved to Romania for a time. Um, it was my dad . . . had a fulbright scholarship there, uh, studying international law because it was a, it was a communist country at the time. It was under the dictator Ceausescu {Chow-chess-q00]. And so a lot of stories growing up, of how he had to hold me - I was a toddler at the time - you know - in the food lines in order to get food. How there were spies everywhere and they had to slip the Book of Mormon to someone underneath the table that was interested. How they had to bribe the doctors with cigarettes to treat my older brother. And so there was a lot of lessons, uh, when I was younger about how important freedom of religion is and accepting everyone. And then in New York, though too, and, and I love this about my parents: how they taught diversity.`

>`You know my dad would always teach about respect of other religions too. Well, he was proud of our LDS heritage. He would always tell the story of being in this small apartment student housing in New York City and our neighbors were Orthodox Jews and how they helped on another. And they didn't want to operate machinery on the Sabbath. And so they would come over and they would knock, not ring the doorbell, but knock on my parents door and say, ""Can you come push the elevator buttons for them on the Sabbath day so that they could keep their Sabbath Holy. And so I was also, always growing, I always grew up with the idea that you did say ‘happy holidays’ and not ‘Merry Christmas’ and that you respect everybody's religions; and that we . . we kept coffee in our cupboard, if we had friends come over that were visiting . . that drank that. And so it was more of a very, I think I had a lot of LDS pride and a lot of like heritage kind of a feeling to it, like this is us; and someone else might be . . Jewish, and- and so that's something I want to kind of put out there too. Because I think that formed a lot of how I thought about my faith. And then I . . . we moved to Salt Lake City. That’s where I started . . kindergarten. And from there –`

>`JD: Was it in the early to mid-80s? That you were in Romania, basically?`

>`Lauren: Yes. Mm-hm, Yes. And then we moved to Salt Lake City. So neither of my parents are from Salt Lake. But that's where I was raised for the most part. And we settled right in Salt Lake City. My Dad's legally blind, too. So he could never drive. So we always lived in a downtown area. So, you know, this is before remote working. That wasn't a thing, right? So we always lived in a very downtown sort of central area for the most part, so that he could ride his bike or catch a ride to the office . . or sometimes even walk, and so we lived in Salt Lake City and--`

>`JD: Can I just say, legally blind, Columbia Law School, Fullbright Scholar. That's a lot.`

>`Lauren: Yeah. Yeah. My dad is uh . . I love my dad . . and I say that cuz . . . yeah. There'll be a-`

>`Interviewer: -some twists and turns.`

>`Lauren: Yeah. Some twists and turns. But I, I love my dad. Yeah, yeah. And he's, he is a remarkable man. His dad . . did not go to college. So--`

>`JD: Whoa.`

>`MC: Wow.`

>`Lauren: Yeah, so . . he yeah . . he was yeah, he was a really neat, he is a really neat guy. (deep breath)`

>`MC: Was he legally blind from a young age . . or?`

>`Lauren: So he --actually I have the journal entry. It's fascinating. Um, when he finds out that he's legally blind. So he went on a mission to the Philippines. So right before he was being raised in Oregon and he couldn't see as well in high school and so they did eye tests on him and they noticed that . . glasses weren't helping it. Something was wrong; and they did a bunch of tests. And they later learned that he had what is called Stargardt's disease; and it's a hereditary - uh, macular degeneration - uh - of the eyes. And so it gets worse . . with age. And then he, he did get his driver's license when he was 16, but he went on a mission. Then when he came back from his mission, after the Philippines, and I've talked to mission companions of him. They say: “I just remember him as the elder that couldn't see.” He came back from his mission and, and could not get a driver's license at that age. He could not see and they said, ""You are legally blind."" So, he was 21. And so, he wrote in his journal; it was his mission journal. He said, ""The wildest thing just happened. I just found out I as legally blind. This is crazy, but he, you know what? I'll get great airline tickets. . . You know, I could, you know, like something about, you know, this, this is going to be okay."" He was very optimistic. But yeah, when my mom and dad dated, my mother would drive and would have to pick him up and he never drove growing up. So my mother - bless her soul - like she had to drive everywhere. You know, every road trip and, you know, she’ll have six kids total, later on. But yeah, so yeah, it was interesting growing up with a dad . . that didn’t drive. I remember though, sometimes he’d be like, “We’d got, we needed to get to church.” And I remember him getting in the driver’s seat once. And just like . . freaking out as like a seven-year-old. He, he didn’t do that later on . . because it got worse. His eyesight is pretty bad. Now.`

>`JD: So you moved to Salt Lake City.`

>`Lauren: Moved to Salt Lake City. And I remember . . every Sunday, usually walking cuz that story didn't have to happen like once or twice, but we would walk down the alley to get to our church building. And it was an old historic church in Salt Lake City. And it had a beautiful stained glass window at the front of the chapel of . . . Christ knocking on ‘that door without a doorknob.’ And so Christ, and by the way, I just loved that. I loved that stained glass window. I loved having Christ there in the chapel every day and that symbolism.`

>`JD: Tell us about the knob not being there?`

>`Lauren: Yeah. That Christ is knocking, but you have to let him in. You have to let him in. And . . um. Yeah. And so it was it was beautiful. It was a small ward. It was a close-knit ward. I was the only girl my age in the ward. And then I only had brothers. And so when people say, ""What was that like?"" I I, there weren't really other girls in the ward to say, ""Oh we were being taught roles."" Because I was the only girl in my family. I was, I mean, I was, I was being taught roles. Trust me. Like I was being called difficult and the tomboy and I was getting left out of my older brother's activities. I felt it. You know, I think I was a born kind of feminist and frustrated that I couldn't do, you know, I couldn't hang with the boys, but there, there, were there weren't that thing, those things, being taught in the church in my early years.` 

>`You know? I was married in the nativity most often every year. And, it was just a very close, caring ward. And then my best friend. I just . . I was, I just needed one good friend, and I just had one best friend, and she was not LDS. So um, yeah. So that was it. It was, it was good. And we were, you know, were both were very - my dad spent a lot of time with my older brothers. I, my mother was really nurturing. I was the youngest for 5 years; and I had two younger brothers and she spent a lot of time taking care of them. And I helped her take care of them, and so I just went and found friends, and this this friend Abby, um, actually wa a big part of my childhood and we would just play out in the goalie in Salt Lake City and, and, just be imaginative. But she didn't . . that's something I want to say . . she'd didn't - so she was not LDS. And so in some ways I think that I might have even questioned God before I questioned Santa Claus. Because I, you know I'm being taught in church that this is true but my best friend in the world doesn't believe it.`

>`JD: So she didn't believe in God?`

>`Lauren: I don't know if she believed in God or not. Actually. I don't know. But, you know. Well, I'll, I'll tell this story first; and then we'll get into my questioning of God.`

>`MC: She wasn't actively religious.`

>`Lauren: Yeah. I did, I like, I don't know what religion, right? I didn't know. Yeah, but we . .  she came to church with me a couple of times. We invited her and she came to primary and it was really fun for me. And I do remember one Sunday morning. We went ever week. We went all three hours every week. I was a three-hour girl right? We can say that. Walked uphill both ways and went to church three hours.` 

>`MC: Three hours.` 

>`Lauren: And, and, and Abby came with me a few times. I remember. And then I remember one Sunday morning, everybody's getting ready, and my mom stopped me on the stairs and said, ""Hey, sweetheart, you know how Abby has come to church with you on Sundays?"" And I said, ""Yeah."" She said, ""Well, what's what Abby does on Sundays is she swims."" She was a very good swimmer. She was on the swim team. ""And so they've invited you to go swimming today and you are going to go with Abby today because that's what Abby does on Sundays."" And so that was sort of the way . . .`

>`MC: I love that.`

>`Lauren: . .  my parents taught me like that. So it was just very okay. And, And I was like great! That’s fun for me. And so I got to go swimming with Abby. So that’s how I remember my parents sort of teaching us to sort of respect and love everyone’s differences and how they grew up.`

>`MC: Did you ever feel a pressure that you needed to proselytize to Abby? Or do you recall? Were you too young to have those feelings? Or I just recall having friends who were not LDS and maybe feeling some pressure internally or externally to recruit my friends to go to church. I wonder, if you ever felt that way with Abby?`

>`Lauren: I didn’t feel that way with Abby. I do remember having visitors from out of the country visiting us, and me singing I am a child of God and them saying, “that we don't believe in God don't sing that,” but I remember thinking oh, okay, oops. Like i remember feeling embarrassed. But I don't think I ever felt the pressure . . . to proselytize to her. No.`

>`JD: It sounds like your parents were very globally-minded and not, it sounds like they didn't have the sort of provincial Mormon Bubble mindset, that's what I'm getting so far.`

>`Lauren: Yeah, yeah. And I think that's what I want to express too, because . . you know, people, people wonder. And that's, that's: I'm happy about that part of my childhood and how they did that. Um . . Yeah, they did. They had a global mindset. And so, while I didn't feel pressure to proselytize to Abby, I think through realizing that I would go to church and my best friend didn't. I-I have this very clear recollection of being seven years old. I was in the bathroom; and having a moment of like thinking how happy I know the church is true. That, I - I - did think this is the truth. We know the truth. I have this true church and I know that I'll be with God and I know that I'm safe and that God loves me and I, you know, and for a split second thinking: but what if I don't know? What if it's not true? . . And the fear that enveloped me as a seven-year-old . . thinking that for a split second, I will . . never forget. Because it was . . like it was so palpable, that I was quickly like: ""It is true!"" Like I just shut it off. I was like, ""It is true!” Because it was so scary to me, to think there might not be a God. Or, this might not be right. Because, I think, looking back now, I just had this absolute fear of death. Like I mean, I think most human beings probably you know experience that at some point: like we all die. And I just couldn’t GO there. And, I think honestly, when I look at that moment, I, I think that also, maybe even . . .was the transition into sort of being fascinated with true crime. I was fascinated with true crime as a child. I was fascinated with true crime as a child because I think true crime represented death and my fear of death and the evil of humanity and what is real and like we, we have this safety and comfort in God and heaven and being with our families forever and a plan and a purpose and . . we’re special. And it’s all going to be okay. And we’re protected.`

>`JD: And we're protected.`

>`Lauren: And we're protected. And we’re protected. And true crime is saying there is actually evil in this world. And this is humanity and this is being mortal. and someone could kill you tomorrow and it could all be gone. And I . . remember the first show I started watching . . . [21:56] I was like seven, eight, nine. The first show on TV called Rescue 911. People my age will remember it (smiling)`

>`MC: I remember that show.`

>`Lauren: You remember it? Before Unsolved Mysteries, there was Rescue 911. And you know, and also I think my mother was too busy with the younger kids. And my dad always, my dad was an incredible musician, too. Yeah. My dad, he’s an incredible musician. And he taught my older brothers how to play music.` 

>`JD: That’s where Clark gets it.` 

>`Lauren: Yes. Yeah. You know my brother Clark. And yeah, my, I have a very musical family. I’m the Black Sheep in many ways. That’s, it’s one of them. (smiling) Again, I just went and found friends. But I would watch this show. The good news is everyone was rescued. Hence Rescue 911. But it’s how they would call 911 and get rescued. Like I remember to this day watching where someone comes in, in the middle of the night, and and intruder . . and they come up and start attacking a little girl’s dad with a knife. And the little girl runs down, calls the phone, calls 911. She’s crying. And they’re playing the 911 call on this thing. She’s saying: “Help, My daddy is getting murdered.” and I’m, And you know, they’re doing the B-roll. And so you see the guy with the knife over, you know . . (makes stabbing motion like the intruder)`

>`MC: the reenactment.` 

>`Lauren: The reenactment. Yeah. And I’m thinking, “Hurry, hurry.” And 911 calls. And that was the episode that stuck with me because I thought if she didn’t call right then, he was about to be killed. You know, the react, the reenactment was so like suspenseful - back and forth - and how close her dad was to death, and that she saved him and how frightening that there could just be this other side, the opposite of what faith teaches us, you know, church teaches us. And so I became a very fearful child. And I whenever I’d go to bed at night, I would think, where’s the phone so I can call 911? What if someone comes in the middle of the night? I would practice hiding in my pillows. Like, how would I hide? And I would practice. And I would put my stuffed animals on me. How would I get to my little brothers to save them? Where do- ? Where’s my escape route? I would be up in the middle of the night thinking, do I hear something? Wanting to scream. And this, I say this because this is a big them in my childhood that lasted years. Um, I’m jumping ahead. Like I remember being 11 and screaming for my dad in the middle of the night and he had to run upstairs and I just thought someone was in my house. So this started very young and lasted a very long time, which we’ll get into. Um. And so looking back with adult eyes, I think I was just processing my fear of death, like what this contradiction to what I’m being taught in Church and what the world really is. And I also remember in elementary school going to the playground and having girls say, “Oh look, there’s Satan coming out of a house.” It was recess. And taking it very literally and fearful. And then someone was saying, “Well, if you look in the mirror in the middle of the night and say Bloody Mary, Satan’s going to appear.” And being absolutely afraid of mirrors at night for years. Like just so afraid. And my mother started noticing. My mother was very aware. She was, she was very nurturing. I remember my dad was out of town and she went and bought me Cinderella. Actually, just to watch at night cuz I could not sleep. And I, I, I still have Disney Cinderella memorized. Like, I can, I can recite almost the whole thing still because I would just watch it every night. Which is interesting because I think I saw her in this very abusive situation because that the thing. I know everyone’s like, “Oh, Cinderella just gets rescued.” And, and that is a problem because I did . . that did affect me. But she also . . They started with, ‘she’s being abused by her stepmother’ and her . . these people are horrible to her, but she, she also, you know, doesn’t stop dreaming and perseveres and, you know, saves herself, I guess through her beauty and kindness. We’ll get to that. But you know -`

>`JD: but um wasn’t there a murder attempt in Cinderella or am I . . ?`

>`Lauren: I think the original. Well, yeah. And, And the wicked stepmother completely dehumanizes her and like wants to kill her once she finds out she’s in love with the prince and you know what I mean?` 

>`JD: There’s some true crime in there.`

>`Lauren: There’s some definite true crime in Cinderella. Yeah. But she’s kind and she’s beautiful and you know of course. Yeah, then she falls in love at first sight - and I know, I know all the – I know all the problems with Cinderella. Um, but I would watch that show and . . yeah, so I think, I think that was a big part of my childhood. Oh, and I even remember in first grade - this was like the era of MCRuff the Crime dog. I mean, they talked about kidnappers in first grade. Like You’re going to be kidnapped. And I remember McRuff the crime dog police officer coming in and talking to us in first grade. Like, as you walk from school, cuz we all walked home from school alone then. You know. There were no surveillance cameras when you walk home from school, um, look for the McGruff crime dog house. They’re the safe houses. And I remember thinking that is bull. Like if I was a kidnapper, I would be like, Make me a McGruff crime house so that the kids will be lured in.” So i remember I would walk past houses where I would see McGruff crime dog in the window and just think, “Dude, that’s freak.” Like just be scared of that house cuz like they’re, I know who they are. They’re playing one on me. So yeah.`

>`MC: That really fascinating that you would work that out. You know what I mean? Kind of a twist it to be like, “it’s a trap!”` 

>`Lauren: (beaming and smiling) Yeah, you know, that’s where I went.`

>`MC: It’s so interesting to hear you talking about the fear of being kidnapped. I don’t know if young kids now have the same fear, but I think growing up in the 80s, we heard a lot about kidnapping and stranger danger and you know the milk carton kids, were the missing kids. IT was a big fear. Maybe that’s intrinsically a childhood fear, but I felt that a lot.`

>`JD: But I also want to note (to Lauren) for you particularly story there’s a combination of - I would say - precociousness, in the sense that you’re pondering existential things at age seven but also, I don’t want to pretend any diagnosis but there seems to be a high level of anxiety . . ?` 

>`Lauren: Probably.`

>`JD: When you start learning about the dangers of the world and the realities of the world you internalize that and process it in what I would say is a very sophisticated way relative to what probably I and lots of other kids might have done. Um, but there may be a teeny bit of scrupulosity in this story as it unfolds. And that’s, that’s what I was mentioning to Grayson before we started.` 

>`Lauren: (beaming) Oh, really?`

>`JD: High level of conscientiousness.`

>`Lauren: Yeah?` 

>`JD: Yeah.`

>`Lauren: Interesting. (still beaming)`

I have both oropharyngeal dysphagia and acid reflux and I might need to travel a 16hr flight with 22hrs toral with 1 stop. 

Its hard to stay on a acid reflux diet while trying to find food that I can swallow 

My oropharyngeal dysphagia makes it hard to eat sticky foods that coat the tongue, or anything that becomes pasty after chewing.. Example: Oatmeal, risotto, mashed potato, thick soup, thick yogurt, nutbutters, plain bread... 

What I can eat: Boiled vegetables, salad with yogurt dressing and nuts, mixing textures like plain rice with soup, eggs, chicken or fish if not dry 

I usually have to focus on creating the right texture in my mouth which includes mixing foods so that the final texture is not sticky, pasty or dry. 

Due to acid reflux i stay away from: fruit, sugar, dairy except yogurt, tomato, citrus, red meat, onion, garlic citrus, coffee and tea, peppermint. 

I can't imagine what ill do in airports and on the plan.. how do I prepare? I haven't eaten out in months and if I go to a coffee shop i can't order anything it looks like bread is dry and its sandwiches with cheese and tomato etc.. 

I can get packaged nuts but how else will I eat.. any ideas? ",0,1763183801.0,dysphagia,4,0.5,False

Bit of a back story - my partner and i are going to Japan on the 18th of February and I'm aiming to put away $10k for the trip (not that i have the intention of spending anywhere near that, It's more so an arbitrary aim to reach between now and then to test my frugal abilities and see how i can live well below my means lol).

I currently have $5375, i can reliably put a minimum of $200 away each week which would bring me to $8375, just need to make up the remaining $1625.

I'm currently doing the following to save extra

\- Driving less, cycling more  
\- Eating at home (currently budgeting $50 a week for shopping as i can eat free food at work during the day)  
\- Making coffee at home (and getting the free stuff at work)  
\- Only shopping reduced/sale at the grocery store  
\- Doing my own car maintenance  
\- $50 secret santa for christmas  
\- rarely eating out  
\- not buying any non essentials

Any extra recommendations for saving a little extra? Obviously you don't know my life circumstances but any tips are appreciated

Under the influence…,"I (25m) have been hanging out with a coworker (24f) who I can now consider one of my best friends. We go for coffee, we get dinner, we have nights with wine and movies at my place and we cook together. It’s perfect and we have great conversations.

We recently were invited to a 22nd birthday celebration for a mutual friend whom we had never mingled with before, so we really only knew each other there. There was liquor involved, and everyone was having a great time. Karaoke, pizza party, card games. A classic house party (noise complaints included lol).
 
Eventually I gathered up the courage to sit by her on the couch and wrap my arm around her, tell her I had romantic feelings for her, and that I think we should talk about it….

This is when the alcohol started talking for me, and my anxiety began to take control. 
I found myself feeling like I needed to admit everything, so we agreed to walk downstairs and outside to chat. 
I was plastered.

We talked about my feelings and hers being similar. (Hell yes.) 
But the details have escaped me, and we haven’t really revisited it since. 

I dropped the ball there when I choked down a cigarette, hoping I could soothe my nerves. Really it just made the moment feel like I was deflecting the whole connection. I wanted to rush because of how fluttered I was, and I asked her for a kiss. She told me she and I worked together so it wouldn’t be so easy. 

She mentioned something about commitment and I insisted that I could do it, even though I have issues about it. 

At this point the host of the party came out to find us talking and told us everyone had gone home. So that meant it was time for bed! 

She (24f) went home and I was too far gone to get myself home, so I crashed at the house we partied in. 
Woke up with the worst feeling of ruining a proper moment. 

She told me she had similar feelings. She told me we had discovered them around the same time. I’ve been so happy I told her, these few days passed, but I wish it was under different circumstances. 

Since, we’ve only really glazed over it, she mentions I shouldn’t feel bad for it, and that it’s better I said something than keeping it to myself. 

I tell her I’m glad it came to the surface but the awkward part is only beginning. 

What can I do now? The conversations we can have, are done. And the only difference is that we know we care about each other. This is all I ever want but I have to make up for my lack of self preservation while my admittance came to the surface.  

All without getting into my own troubles with commitment. 😭

1oxj6pp,https://i.redd.it/bvsz0hcktc1g1.jpeg,I’m an Urban Explorer for the US Government (Part 1),"If you’re reading this, it means I made it past the Palantir webcrawlers. This is not entirely a mistake. If I can say anything at all, it’s because I was allowed to. That’s also why I’m posting here: disguising something as fiction and dropping it where that nobody in their right mind would think otherwise goes a long way. Who am I to judge what constitutes a “right mind” at this point. I used to think I could live with all the secrets—that the money was good enough to keep me quiet. 

I’m a contractor for the U.S. government. I’m aware of how vague that sounds, but it’s the most specific I can really get without setting off alarms. My company is a pretty standard shell that coordinates dispatch, retrieval, and payment for people like me who investigate places that no longer exist.

I’m the kind of guy who couldn’t hack it at a nine to five. I’d rather dodge rental cops, sneaking into a boarded-up Cinnabon at 2 a.m. to map holes in reality, than sit in a cubicle all day pretending I don’t want to suck-start a nine millimeter.

Abandoned places are dangerous in plenty of obvious ways: broken glass, black mold, the occasional meth kitchen, or the homeless dude who has every right to be there because no one else is. As a kid, running around a dying mall or crumbling factory felt like freedom—a haven for breaking shit, tagging walls, and pretending that being edgy would somehow make me matter.
It all seems insane now that I fully comprehend how getting busted or a round of tetanus shots were the least of my worries.

The last thing I’ll do is try to convince you not to go to an abandonment after telling you the things I know. Forbidden fruit being the sweetest and all. All I offer is my story—do with it what you will.

My “career” began around six years ago, under the instruction of a man I’ll call Marcus. Marcus was an explorer through and through. The guy reeked of Marlboro Reds and spent every minute between gigs researching the next spot he’d hit. He’d spent a lot of time in Europe as an exchange student. From what he told me, they’ve got it worse over there—centuries more history producing everything from abandoned villages and towns to entire industrial complexes and bunkers.

I had explored spots all over the Midwest with him and other friends on and off for about six months. I had finished up a stint of incredibly soul-draining jobs and needed the time to reset—mostly pretending I was somehow closer to deciding what to do with my life. Exploring was one of the few things I did back then that made me feel tangibly alive.

One day, when Marcus and I were supposed to meet for coffee and planning, someone else was there with him. She stayed seated but offered me her hand as I walked up to the table where Marcus was lounging. Her grip was firm, and she gave Marcus—who was oblivious to my presence, lost in his screen—a curt look before greeting me.

“Joshua, right?”
“Yeah, sorry if I seem surprised, Mark didn’t mention anyo—”
“That’s perfectly alright,” she said. “Marcus has kept me updated on your progress. My associates and I believe you might be just the kind of person we’re looking for. Please, have a seat.”

I smiled awkwardly and nodded in feigned interest as I sat. My patience with this lady was already wearing thin after her interruption, but I couldn’t help being curious why some suit was trying to hire me based on my qualifications as a vagrant.

“Like… a job?”

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught Marcus pausing his frantic typing to take a sip and chuckle at my confusion.

“A position is on the table, provided you meet standards,” she said. “Marcus will fill you in on the specifics. I simply needed to make contact. That will be all for now. It was a pleasure meeting you.”

She stood. Before I had time to mutter a half-hearted “Uh, sure,” she’d already strode past me, placing a hand high on my shoulder.
“Good luck.”

Marcus snorted into his Americano, tossing a lazy, “Later, Judy,” in her direction without taking his eyes off the screen.

I let the silence stretch long past its third trimester before finally breaking it.
“Fill me in on what? Are we still checking out the cement plant today?”

Marcus fiddled with his tabs for a moment, then spun his laptop around. Several windows were open: an aerial map, structural layouts at least fifty years old, and finally an incomplete wire transfer—the routing number of which looked suspiciously like my own.

“I find my method of recruitment more fun,” he said. “But in full disclosure, that’s higher than your normal rate on account of onboarding costs and a bonus.”

It had a lot more zeros than a Pizza Hut paystub.

“Marcus… who are you?”

He smiled the smile of a man who’d just pulled off a massive joke—but in his eyes, something else shined. The intensity of it both drew me in and made me want to look away.

“One good question begets another,” he said. “So I’ll ask you: if you see a tree fall in the woods, and it makes no sound… what would you do about it?”

“What?”

“We’ll talk shop on-site. C’mon, we’re burning daylight.” He closed the laptop and slid it into his messenger bag.

I finished the last of my cheap drip coffee and watched as he stood and made a beeline for the door, tossing a few bucks on the table for the waitress. I considered my position carefully. 

I had known Marcus just long enough to go along with whatever this was. I wasn’t ready to believe it was anything other than some kind of prank.

Forty minutes later, we made it through the last town before the factory. I caught glimpses of its single, large smokestack from the freeway, but the trees obscured any view from lower down on the dirt road. Nobody seemed to be around when we passed through the main street—then again the cement plant had been shut down a few decades before I was born. There was an off-kilter swing gate blocking the access road, with a sign that said CAUTION: SINKHOLES right next to a NO TRESPASSING sign that was so sun-bleached it was hardly legible.

Marcus pulled his Tacoma sharply around to face the direction we’d come from, leaving room for me to do the same behind him. He hopped out with a different bag slung over his shoulder—something I found odd since he usually made a point of traveling light in case we had to book it.

“Leave the tourist gear for this one,” he said. “I have everything you’ll need. Otherwise, keep doing what you’ve always done. Try to just… go with it. I’m sure things are moving quickly to you, but no amount of me yapping is going to help until you see.”

“Alright then, lead on, O’ knowing one,” I joked.

He didn’t laugh.

The man before me seemed much different than the one who sat grinning across the table less than an hour ago. Now he was sober, focused on me in a way I had not seen before.

I pulled my digital camera and snacks out of my bag, then left the bag altogether just stuffing a basic first-aid kit and a few flashlights into my cargo pocket. Marcus handed me a respirator, the kind with detachable filters. We hopped the gate.

The quiet was intoxicating after a few days away from a “bando”. The fall air was thick with humidity and it suited my lungs just fine. We crossed a shallow dike running parallel to a set of train tracks before deciding to skip a sketchy looking suspension bridge that went over a decent size river

I’ll admit, to this day I’ve had a nicotine problem ever since I started running with Mark. But addiction aside, stopping to take that scene in and acclimate calmed my nerves after a strange morning. The acrid plume I slowly drew into my lungs grounded me.

“What’s the skinny on this one, Marcus? Is there some kind of plan I should follow?”

We leaned against the wall of the silo stack. Marcus and I had skipped the rest of our usual sightseeing and went straight to the area marked on his map—a break in the wall leading down into a basement.

Marcus took a moment to reposition his cigarette to the corner of his mouth before speaking, gesturing over his shoulder at the gaping hole in the earth.

“Follow my lead and do everything I say without hesitation. That’s your plan for now. Any second thoughts?”
“Lead on.”

We went.

Just before the hole in the wall, Marcus donned his respirator and put on a headlamp, holding another flashlight in his hand. He adjusted the headlamp to point nearly straight at the ground, then motioned for me to press my hands to my mask’s filters and inhale—the mask sucked tight to my face. Marcus nodded in satisfaction and flashed me a thumbs-up.

“Keep an eye on your footing, and don’t leave your flashlight on anything for more than a few moments. Let’s go.”

We clambered down into the basement of the silo, ducking a hunk of ventilation duct hanging loosely from the ceiling. Everything—the thick dust hanging in the air after each step, the vulgar graffiti—was par for the course.

Marcus cracked a glowstick and dropped it at his feet. He painted a beam of light across the walls briefly, then took a left. I followed, not sure if I was starting to see things in the shadows or if the tension from the café was finally getting to me.

It was when we passed the next corner and all outside light had faded that I realized I wasn’t seeing things in the shadows. I was seeing the shadows themselves.

Everywhere I swept my narrow beam the dark seemed to shrink away from it. A chill set in my spine, like watching CG Tom Hanks in The Polar Express for the first time. If this was a prank, Marcus would’ve had to violate the laws of physics.

“Good—you noticed. That’s why I told you to keep your light moving. Needed to know if you were paying attention. The slower you move, the more obvious it is.”

He swept his own beam in circles around mine. The mist responded by growing thicker at the edges of the light.

“Don’t do that too much it seriously does piss it off though” I ignored his apparent lack of concern for my worldview shattering in real time.

“This… is why we’re here?”

“Astute observation, young grasshopper. Nictophyllosis is one of the things that likes to crop up when nobody’s around. All you need to know is: keep the light on, and keep a spare handy. At all times.”

I longed for the overcast sky outside, my off-hand wrapped tightly around my backup light as I tried to convince myself that Momma didn’t raise a bitch.

We continued. Rounding another corner, we came into the main room I’d seen in the architectural diagrams: a run of conveyor belts under the silo stack. Marcus stopped to check various side rooms and a hopper that protruded from the ceiling. Finally, he set a small cube on the ground in the middle of the room. It clicked on, projecting a square of red laser light on the walls.

“We’ll need to be a ways back for this part. Any shadow you cast makes the yield less. We really only get one shot at this.”

He placed a ceramic container on top of the cube—a rectangle the same footprint, just taller. We backed out around the corner. Marcus clicked a remote, and the laser incrementally rose toward the ceiling. 

He gestured for me to follow him back in. A crackle. A faint line of soot on the wall closest to the device.

“Damn, Mark—how powerful is that thing?”
“Yeah, my bad. Don’t look directly at it. That’s a lot stronger than a laser pointer.” 

Now the box projected a small square on the ceiling; the dust revealed a wall of light matching the container’s sides. Marcus shone his beam at the ceiling, then flicked it downward sharply.
“Gotcha.”

I reflexively inhaled as the several inches of air above the open container turned opaque—like ink blooming in water.

“Pretty neat, right? This is our sample.”
He fished a small lid from his coat pocket, approaching the light field gingerly, still compressing the black matter downward with his beam.

“It could get a bit hairy after I lid it. Follow my lead. Do not panic. Do you understand?”
“Y-yeah.”

For what felt like a minute, I stood transfixed as he slowly lowered the lid before clamping it down with a hiss. A chill crept down my back—too real to be imagination. Marcus’ breath came out of his mask as a fog. My fingertips burned as if dunked in ice water.

“Turn toward the exit.”

Beside me, Marcus wrestled the container, slipping a metal clasp around it lengthwise—a motion that looked easier than it probably was. The container gyrated like something inside was spinning at impossible speed.

“Hand on the wall.”

I pressed my palm to the concrete. It felt warm compared to my fingers.

“Walk.”

The pounding of my heart drowned out the ringing in my ears. My vision narrowed to a tiny tunnel. I decided the mask wasn’t going to stop me from trying to hyperventilate.

“Stop.”

I froze mid-step and slowly lowered my foot. Marcus looked at me without a hint of impatience.

“Close your eyes. Breathe deeply. Then open them.”

I obeyed. When I opened them again, pale gray light filtered down in distant rays through thick dust.

“What are we waiting for?”

“There are two things wrong with this picture,” 
Marcus said. “One is in your hand, and the other is on the ground. You’d better figure them out before we freeze to death.”

I stupidly looked down at my left hand before realizing—the right was still curled around the chipped corner of the wall.

“We turned left to get down here, didn’t we?” I asked.

“Correct. And what did I leave at the entrance?”
“The glowstick.”

No glowstick ahead.
I turned right.

The hallway that should’ve been our exit was swallowed in darkness. My beam reached only a few feet before being eaten alive.

“Fuck.”

“Close your eyes again,” Marcus said. “And keep following the wall. You got this.”

My numb right hand scraped forward along the concrete. I rounded the corner—one step, then another. We moved cautiously until the air warmed and the sound of wind swelling from outside brought me back.

I opened my eyes. The hole back to the world was in front of us.
Marcus nodded toward his glowstick on the ground. “Go ahead and climb up. I’ll just be a sec.”
His tone was different—lighter. That eased my mind.

I scrambled up the broken wall, welcomed the muddled sky, and pressed my back to the silo. Slow breaths. My hands rubbed together for heat. I lit up to feel something warm.
Marcus emerged a few minutes later—no worse for wear. Giddy, even.

“Gnarly, right?”
I managed a half-laugh.
“Are you going to tell me what the hell any of this was, or what it has to do with a job?”
He laughed in my face.

“Nope! Go home and rest up. Call me when you pull yourself together and if you’re still interested I’ll give you the whole spiel. Sound fair?”
“Not at all, but… doesn’t seem like I’m in a position to complain. Where are you off to in such a hurry?”

He grinned. His backpack gently wriggled.
“Yeah, I’ll walk you to your car. C’mon.”

I didn’t need the time off to decide. Hell, I didn’t even need the walk back. I didn’t have a clue what I’d seen, and that was a rush was unlike anything I’d ever felt.

“Is there a dental plan?”
“Not really. But that’s not usually something someone making almost six figures worries about, is it?” he said, patting my back.

“Oh yeah—Judy’ll want this back.”
He plucked something from my neck. Right where Judy had grabbed me earlier.

“Needed to make contact, huh?” I asked. “I thought something about that interaction was strange. What’s her deal?”

“Standard-issue vital monitor and mic. Just doing her job. Don’t worry… she’s usually not that weird.”

I couldn’t tell if he was joking, and I was too tired to care. Every time Marcus had me thinking I knew anything about him, he found a way to remind me I knew absolutely nothing.

I sat in my car for a long time. I had about an hour’s drive back to my motel.
It would be dark again soon

The elevator jolted to a halt on the fourth floor, the doors shuddering open with a metallic groan that sounded suspiciously like resignation. Elias stepped out onto the thin, industrial-grey carpet, immediately hit by the stale cocktail of recirculated air, cheap instant coffee, and the low-level hum of a hundred conversations happening at once.

This was ""Zenith Customer Solutions"", a name that promised a peak but delivered a basement, regardless of the floor number. The fluorescent lights overhead buzzed with a headache-inducing flicker, casting a sickly pallor over the rows of fabric-walled dividers that stretched out like a maze designed to trap hope.

Elias adjusted his collar, which already felt too tight, and scanned the room. He was here for the ""Vital-Link Wellness Band"" account. The irony wasn't lost on him: he was about to spend eight hours a day explaining to angry strangers why their wristbands weren't effectively tracking their inner peace, all while standing in a room that actively depleted it.

He navigated the narrow aisles, dodging a supervisor with a clipboard who was walking too fast and a trash can overflowing with energy drink cans. The noise was a wash of white sound: ""Have you tried resetting it?"", ""I understand your frustration,"" ""Please hold.""

He found his assigned row, G, and counted down the numbers. G-14.

It was a corner cubicle, though that was a generous term for the three-foot expanse of particle board. The walls were pinned with the curled edges of old memos and a single, faded motivational poster of a cat hanging from a branch that someone had defaced with a mustache.

Sitting in the center of the desk was a computer monitor so old it had yellowed to the color of nicotine,stained teeth. Beside it lay a headset, its foam ear, pads flaking away to reveal the black plastic beneath, the cord tangled in a knot that looked impossible to undo. Elias dropped his bag, stared at the blinking cursor on the screen, and sat down.

It took him five minutes to untangle the cord and another five to guess the generic password written on a sticky note under the keyboard (Zenith1). The screen flickered to life, displaying a DOS-like interface with green text: VITAL-LINK SUPPORT v4.2.

He clicked 'READY'. Immediately, a shrill beep pierced his ear.

""Vital-Link, Elias speaking.""

""It’s red!"" A woman’s voice, high,pitched, bordering on hysteria. ""It’s just a solid red line. It’s hot. Is it supposed to be hot?""

Elias referenced the laminated sheet taped to the desk. *Status Light: Red. Protocol: Immediate Redirection.* He hadn't covered this in the twenty minutes orientation video, but the prompt on the screen was blinking urgently.

""Ma'am, I need you to take a deep breath,"" Elias said, his voice falling into a practiced calm he didn't feel. ""I can help you with that. Can you read me the serial number on the inner band?""

""It's... 44902.""

He keyed it in the numbers. The screen flashed. INPUT CODE.

""Thank you. Now, there are two small letters after the number. What are they?""

""Uh... 'RF'.""

He typed it. A block of text appeared on his screen, stark and specific. It wasn't a troubleshooting step.

""Okay, ma'am. I need you to listen closely. Leave your location immediately. Walk North. Take the second turn to your right. Walk fifty paces. Enter the third door on your left. Do not move until you are approached.""

""Okay... okay. North. Second right. I'm going."" Click.

He stared at the screen as it reset. What kind of tech support was this?

*Beep*

""Hello?"" A child's voice. Maybe seven years old. Sniffling.

""Hi there,"" Elias said, shifting in his creaky chair, ignoring the sweat pricking at his hairline. ""Is everything okay?""

""My bracelet. It's looking at me. It's all red.""

""It's okay, buddy. Don't be scared. Is your mom or dad there? No? Okay, I need you to be brave for a second. Can you read numbers?""

The kid read the serial through sniffles. Then Elias asked for the code.

""NK.""

The screen populated new text.

""Good job. Now, listen. Go out the front door. Turn left. Walk until the sidewalk ends. Turn right. Walk twenty steps. Stop. Close your eyes. Count to one hundred.""

""Okay."" The line went dead.

Elias rubbed his temples. This felt wrong. He looked over the divider; his neighbor was calmly explaining how to sync steps to an iPhone.

*Beep.*

The third call was a man, breathless, aggressive. ""I'm stuck in traffic on the bridge and this damn thing is blinding me! It's solid red! I can't turn it off!""

Elias didn't even blink this time. He felt like an automaton. ""Sir, pull over. Give me the serial.""

""88215. Fix it!""

""Code?""

""QX. Hurry up!""

""Leave your car. Walk forward in the direction of traffic. Count four pillars. Stop. Face the water. Wait.""

""What? I'm not gonna…""

""Those are the instructions, sir. Walk forward. Count four pillars. Face the water.""

The man hung up without a thank you, just the sound of a car door slamming.

Elias sat back, the headset heavy on his ears. The screen blinked back to READY, but he didn't click it again immediately. He looked at his hands; they were shaking slightly. He took a few more calls that afternoon, a teenager in a mall, an elderly woman in a library, all with the red light, all ending with him giving precise, nonsensical coordinates. Walk South. Turn East. Third bench.

At 5:00 PM, the system locked him out automatically.

He pulled the headset off, rubbing the black flakes from his ear. The office hummed on, oblivious. He grabbed his bag and walked back to the elevator, the mysterious instructions swirling in his head as the doors slid shut on his first day.

That night, Elias sat on the edge of his sagging mattress, bathed in the blue light of the evening news. He was nursing a lukewarm beer, trying to wash the sound of the beeps out of his head.

""Breaking news from the East River Bridge,"" the anchor announced, her face composed in practiced gravity. ""A multi,car pileup has resulted in one fatality. Police are investigating.Maybe DUI or malfunction.""

The screen cut to shaky helicopter footage. Ambulances, flares, twisted metal. Then, a brief, blurry zoom,in on a gurney being wheeled away. A limp hand hung off the side. On the wrist, unmistakable in the strobe of emergency lights, was a Vital-Link band. It was pulsing a rhythmic, angry red.

Elias froze. The beer bottle slipped from his hand, thumping onto the carpet and foaming over. He didn't clean it up.

The next day at work, during his fifteen minutes break, Elias huddled in the fire escape stairwell, the only place in the building where the WiFi reached but the supervisors didn't. His hands trembled as he opened the map app on his phone.

He typed in the coordinates for the East River Bridge. He zoomed into the northbound lane, right where the traffic would have stalled. He replayed the instructions in his head. *Walk forward. Count four pillars. Face the water.*

He traced the path on the screen with his thumb. One pillar. Two. Three. Four. He dragged the view to see what lay directly opposite that specific spot, facing the water.

His breath hitched. The phone nearly slipped from his clammy fingers. It made no sense, and yet, looking at the satellite imagery, it made terrifying, absolute sense. He shoved the phone into his pocket, his heart hammering a frantic rhythm against his ribs.

He went back to his cubicle, but he didn't log in immediately. Instead, he opened a browser window and minimized it to a sliver. He searched.

*Woman heart attack apartment 6th Elm.*

A small local news item popped up. *Found deceased in a vacant building. Authorities are puzzled as she lived two blocks away. Wearing a 'health' bracelet that failed to alert paramedics.*

*Child death tire swing.*

Another article. *Tragedy in the suburbs. Seven years old boy was found beneath a neighbor's tree. Natural causes suspected, sudden cardiac arrest. Parents say he wandered off confused.*

He found another one, a case he hadn't taken but one that fit the timeline. *Child found dead in subway stairway.* The article mentioned the bracelet.

One oped piece caught his eye: *""Vital-Link or Vital-Sink? The wearable tech that watches you die.""* The journalist made a crude, scathing joke about how the only thing the bracelet accurately tracked was the time of death, calling it a ""countdown timer for the gullible.""

Elias sat there, the pieces clicking together with the cold precision of a locking mechanism. The red light wasn't a malfunction. It was a notification.

Over the next few days, he listened harder. He noted the serial numbers. He noted the two letters codes.

44902-DL. The support software, VITAL-LINK SUPPORT v4.2, used the numbers to locate the user, and his place of death.

And the letters.

No idea yet.

It hit him on a Tuesday, midway through a call with an old man gasping for air in a park. This time he asked him for his precise location, and tracked the instructions on his phone to the final location. A synagogue. And the others: a church, a mosque and a cemetery.

The realization washed over him, cold and absolute. The two letters weren't a model number. They were the religion. The belief system. The code determined the ritual, the position, the final comfort needed for the departure.

Elias looked at the old monitor, at the blinking green cursor waiting for his input. He wasn't tech support. He wasn't fixing glitches. He wasn't saving anyone.

He was guiding souls to their final destination.

Not the fun “big” gifts… the meaningful ones. The ones you actually want to get right.And every year I get stuck on the same person: the man of God in my life who never really asks for anything. He’s the type who fixes things before anyone notices something’s wrong, prays quietly, and kind of keeps the whole family grounded without making it obvious.

People like him are weirdly hard to shop for. Not because they’re picky—more because the usual stuff doesn’t fit. “**Men’s gadgets” feel random**. Clothes feel like guessing. And he’s definitely not someone who needs more things.

Last Christmas I wanted something different. Something that had a little meaning behind it. I wasn’t trying to be deep or dramatic—I just wanted a gift that showed I actually thought about him.

After looking around for way too long, I ended up with something pretty simple: a small compass with a **verse engraved inside**. Nothing flashy. Nothing expensive. Just something that felt right for him—quiet, personal, and tied to the kind of faith he lives out every day.

When he opened it, he didn’t make a big reaction. He just looked at it, gave a small smile, and kept it. Months later, I saw it sitting on his desk. Not displayed like decoration—just part of his space. That’s when I knew I’d finally picked a gift that landed.

If you’re stuck looking for [**meaningful Christmas gifts for men**](https://aladean.com/products/man-of-god-compass-2-inspirational-gift-for-men), especially men who live their faith more through action than words, I wrote out the whole story and why the compass ended up being the thing that made sense.

**Reel 4 : Mrithunjayam**

While Hiranmayi waits at the Cafe awaiting her train, another story begins at our now familiar Kerala Cafe, where two siblings meet over coffee to discuss about a Hindu Thirumeni, who is being investigated by the Intelligence Beurau over his alleged connections to black magicians in Tunisia and Kazkh voodoo practitioners. The siblings are namely an IB Officer and an Investigative Journalist,

Over coffee, we get a look-in at the banter shared by the siblings, with a joke by the IB Officer (played by Anoop Menon), in the mix. *Cappucino in our Kerala Cafe - you don't say!* 

The scene then pans over to a trio of journalists undertaking an assignment to cover the spooky goings-on at the *Vanneri Mana.* It excites, arouses curiosity upon the lead journalist that wanted to get a feel, get lost in the mystery of the *mana.* The thirumeni stays unassuming, with a fear within.

With the *mana* having an infamous reputation amongst the inhabitants of that land, claiming lives in the process - a possible love story begins to blossom between the lead journalist and the Thirumeni's granddaughter - like the fragrant opening notes of a new cologne. 

Soon, the journalist's first night at the *mana* begins, the horrors inviting him to the mix.

During the climax, us journeymen realise that the tales don't lie. Dead men never live to tell tales. It's the tales themselves that get storied across ages.

A slow burn as we eventually make that realisation. An illusion so haunting.

Legacy does have a reputation of being dirty, through the ages. Something unchangeable, something that stays true to itself, while inviting seekers to try unravelling it.

About me:

\- I enjoy challenging my awareness believing anything is possible. All about self expansion, awareness, and enjoying what you desire experiencing in life. Although I don't like using the label, for lack of a better term am spiritual. Have done reiki healing for friends more than once.

\- I am a goofball that finds stupid things hilarious then can switch up talking about the most real things. I enjoy both light-hearted and deep, reflective, introspective conversations about the soul, philosophy, experiential knowledge, and spirituality.

\- Love Cyberpunk 2077, the Matrix, Bladerunner 2049, John Wick, and particularly enjoy watching 90's and early 2000 films.

\- Hobbies: I do voice impressions for fun (best impressions are Judy, Female V, Ada Wong, A2, and recently Shrieker's AI from Secret Level's Armored Core). Virtual photography, customizing characters in games and creating lore for them, meditating, visualizing, figure collecting, reading (dark romance), music.

\- A recluse and hermit. I enjoy my solitude and hanging out by myself when I do go out. I do enjoy traveling when I can.

\- Love coffee, sweets, fashion, luxury, scented candles, incense, and wonderful things that are pleasant to the senses.

\- I wear black all the time (even if I'm a girly girl at heart).

\- Introverted, but I open up overtime. I'm selective about the people I talk to, as I have a few but wonderful online friends that feel like family to me.

7. We Remember Now

The last thing she writes, she doesn’t remember writing.

Title: We Remember Now

> The collage fell off the easel tonight. I don’t think it fell. I think it left.

There’s a new face forming at the bottom edge. It looks like mine, but older. Or someone else wearing my expression.

I touched the canvas and heard two voices in my head at once—mine and someone else’s—saying the same words at the same time:
We remember now.

For one moment, I was in two places. In my studio, hand on the canvas. In the café, sitting at my usual table, watching myself walk in.

I think the chip isn’t storing memories anymore. It’s connecting consciousness.

I can feel them pressing against the inside of my skull. They’re not gone. They’re waiting.

If this post disappears, if my account gets wiped, please know: the experiment didn’t fail.

It worked too well.



The comments are panicked, skeptical, hungry.

Someone says it’s the best creepypasta they’ve ever read.

Someone else says it changed while they were scrolling.

The username u/alethea_77 flickers. For a moment, some readers swear it shows as u/wearealethea.

Then the account vanishes.

The painting remains.

Somewhere, a notebook turns a page on its own.

PART II — SUBJECT 87

1. Neural Notes (Distant)

EIDOLON CORPORATION — NEURAL CONTINUITY DIVISION
Internal Report — Subject 87

> Age: 29
Condition: Myoclonic Epilepsy
Device: EIDOLON Continuity Implant v2.7
Status: Post-Op Day 3
Trial Phase: Integration

“Subject displays moderate tinnitus, fragmented REM cycles, and reports of déjà vu. All within expected range. No adverse events recorded.”

The report doesn’t mention the dream.

Or the notebook.

Or the way the air feels thicker near his desk, as if the room has been recently occupied by someone else.


---

2. The Dream and the Diary (Close)

On the third night after surgery, he dreams of text.

Not images. Not scenes. Just text, scrolling upward like a terminal window.

> the collage is watching me
the door won’t open
if i sleep i will wake inside the paint
we’re still here
we’re still here
we’re still—



He wakes with his heart racing and his hands numb.

The dorm room is dim, lit only by the standby glow of the rehab tablet. The assigned bed. The locked window. The standard-issue desk.

Something is on the desk that wasn’t there before.

A notebook.

Old, with a soft, worn cover stained in overlapping strokes of black and reddish-brown paint.

His first thought is: They’re testing me.

His second thought is: This smells like oil paint, not disinfectant.

He sits up slowly, the port in his neck aching as the implant adjusts to the shift in posture.

The notebook is open to the middle, as if someone was interrupted mid-sentence.

The handwriting loops and dives across the page, hurried but strangely careful. Feminine, maybe. Familiar, in a way that makes his stomach twist.

He reads:

> If you’re reading this, the thread found you.
I didn’t give this to you. I don’t know how things cross over.
We are pieces of the same mind now.
Please remember us when the studio comes.



The name at the bottom is written twice, overlapping:

Alethea

The ink is dry, but when he brushes his finger over it, the lines seem to shimmer, as if the page is remembering being written.

“Okay,” he whispers. “Okay.”

He looks up at the door.

Still closed.

Looks at the window.

Still locked.

His ears ring.


---

He turns on the rehab tablet and opens the browser. The EIDOLON portal tries to pull him into a questionnaire about mood and appetite.

He ignores it.

He goes to Reddit.

u/alethea_77 returns no results.

Google offers recipes and Instagram profiles for strangers named Alethea who pose with smoothies and dogs in sweaters.

He feels a strange surge of grief for a person he has no proof exists.
He comments on any thread he can find about the Althea account for hours, some comments appear claiming to remember the thread and telling him to try to find the deleted posts using the way back machine.

His hands tremble.

He tries the Wayback Machine.

Just to check.

It shouldn’t matter.

It does.

There are snapshots without URLs, half-corrupted: black blocks where site names should be, gray bands where images should sit.

And in the thin white strip of preserved text:

> COLL GE F RG TTE F CES
I W KE IN S E LS B DY
WE REMEMBER
ERROR 77: HOST CONTINUITY DETECTED


The timestamps on all of them read 03:14.
The exact minute he woke from his own dream.

He receives a direct message, recognizing parts of the username from the files he saved from the way back machine.

To: u/Subject_EightySeven
Subject: You need to read this before you post again

Hey.
I’m sending this from a disposable account because I can’t message you through any of the official channels without triggering an alert. You can ignore this if you want, but based on the content of your last post, I don’t think you should.
You mentioned the “mirror-lag thing” again on a Reddit thread.
That’s why I’m writing.
We’re not supposed to acknowledge this publicly, but what you’re describing isn’t a hallucination or sleep-paralysis or whatever the commenters are telling you.
It’s an eidolon event.
Before you freak out: it’s not supernatural. It’s not a possession. It’s not a ghost. It’s something else. Something technical. Something we were told would never reach conscious perception in any of the early-cycle subjects.
But it looks like it did.
Specifically in you.
Reply from u/Subject_EightySeven to u/Deep_Internal_Archive
(Sent 2 minutes after reading. Typing pauses visible.)
Okay.
I don’t know who you are, but you clearly know enough about me that I can’t pretend none of this is real.
I’m replying because you said to only message if I’m alone. I am. I locked the bathroom mirror cabinet because I didn’t want to look at myself again tonight.
You said this wasn’t hallucinations. Fine. I’ve known that for a while. When it was just the eye-lag thing or the dream flashes, I thought maybe I was exhausted. But the last two nights she—it—wasn’t just copying me.
Tonight it leaned in first. I didn’t move.
I was brushing my teeth and my reflection already had the brush down and was looking at me like I was the mistake in the picture. You said not to touch it. I wouldn’t.
But you’re being careful with your words and I hate it. Just tell me the part you’re avoiding: does the thing think I’m the copy? Because that’s what it felt like. Like I wasn’t supposed to be standing there.
You also said this: “the version I was before the installation finalized.”
Do you know what that means to me? You’re admitting there WAS a version before. That something changed, or broke, or fractured, or whatever you want to call it. And nobody ever told me what happened in the first week after the implant. I only remember fog and nausea and the lab lights flickering.
And now you’re telling me there’s a part of me walking around like it knows the secrets I wasn’t allowed to keep.
You said no one else notices my phrasing online.
How do YOU notice it?
And how do you know the logs didn’t wipe?
I want specifics.
If you’re going to warn me, warn me fully.
I’m done living half-informed. If this “eidolon” is using the old-copy of me, tell me if that means it remembers things I don’t. Tell me if it’s stronger than me. Smarter. If it’s supposed to replace me if I “destabilize.”
You said it talks.
What happens if it says my name?
I will not be calm if you keep giving me half-truths.
Say the whole thing or don’t message again.
And don’t tell me to avoid mirrors. I already know she’s not staying in the glass.

(sent 41 seconds after receiving her message; multiple edits visible)
Okay—okay. I’m answering fast because I don’t know how long I have on this account. They’re already flagging anomalous outbound traffic from my subnet. So just listen:
1. Yes. You asked if it thinks you’re the copy. It does.
Not always, not fully, but the pattern it’s running matches the primary-state identity from your first 72 hours post-implant. That version was stable, coherent, high-res. You’re not. You’re organic, adaptive, changed. It doesn’t recognize “changed” as legitimate.
That’s all I can say without violating my contract.
2. You asked why I noticed your phrasing.
Because the chip still outputs micro-patterns into your language use. You don’t hear it. But the researchers do.  You write like someone running two internal clocks. You should not be running two clocks.
3. The first week after installation wasn’t fog. That was the wipe cycle. It’s supposed to erase the redundant identity-set before the primary you wakes back up. The mirror-layer should’ve dissolved. Your logs show that it didn’t. It held on. And the system treated it as the “backup original.” That’s why your eidolon behaves like you’re the counterfeit.
4. Stop asking if it’s stronger. Strength isn’t the problem. Priority is.
The eidolon has priority formatting. It doesn’t want to kill you—it wants to overwrite inconsistencies. If you touch it, the system might “resolve the duplicate conflict.”
Guess who the conflict is.
5. The part you’re afraid to ask: Yes, the eidolon remembers everything before the wipe. You remember almost none of it. If it speaks your name, it’s not addressing you. It’s calling the original template forward. That’s why I said don’t initiate.
6. You said it wasn’t staying in mirrors. Yeah. That’s the part that’s not supposed to be possible. It means the boundary between the mirror-process and your physical perception is collapsing. It shouldn’t be strong enough to manifest in a non-reflective environment unless—No. I’m not writing that here.
7. You want the whole truth? Then listen carefully:
You’re not dealing with a “ghost.”  You’re dealing with an identity-layer that was never decommissioned, never wiped, and now believes it has the right to integrate.
It doesn’t hate you.
It doesn’t want you gone.
It just wants to finish the job it thinks was interrupted.
And that job was becoming you.
The version they wanted.
The version the implant was calibrated for before everything went wrong on Day 3.
I’m going to lose this account if I keep typing.
If you reply, do it slowly. Don’t use emotional words. They trigger semantic flags.
And for the love of god—
Do not look over your left shoulder right now.

(This message was deleted from the sender’s outbox 12 seconds after being delivered.)
Behind him, the notebook closes itself with a soft, final thump. He glances over his shoulder remembering the presence of the notebook and decides to read it in completion. He hesitantly walks to his unadorned desk and sits down in his chair every creek of the old furniture making his heart race faster. He opens the pages and reads each journal entry methodically, feeling every emotion as though the notebook itself is alive.
 
He reads every entry slowly, one by one, as if the pages are breathing with him. Every sentence feels loaded. Every line seems to lean forward. It’s like the notebook isn’t just recording emotions—it’s holding them, waiting for him to understand.
And 87 does understand.
More than she should.
She can still hear DEEP’s message repeating in her head, but she knows how to translate the jargon. How to strip out the corporate spin. How to say the truth plainly—the way someone without implant training could understand it.
What DEEP meant was this:
The chip didn’t make a random glitch of her reflection.
It made a second version of her.
A backup copy.
A “perfect” template of who she was during the first days after the implant—before her memory was wiped and her mind adapted and changed.
The problem is simple:
the copy thinks it’s the real one.
And because it was never erased like it was supposed to be, it’s still running in the background, still trying to “correct” her, still showing up in mirrors and dreams and now—terrifyingly—in places where mirrors don’t exist at all.
In DEEP’s language, this is a “duplicate conflict.”
In hers, it’s worse:
There are two of her.
Only one gets to stay.
She closes the notebook halfway through that realization, hands trembling, because there’s something in the entries that suddenly makes sense:
The way the reflection looked at her.
The way its mouth moved before hers.
The way it leaned in like it was checking the edges of her face for cracks.
It wasn’t haunting her.
It was evaluating her.
Looking for weaknesses.
Looking for mismatches.
Looking for proof that she’s the broken one.
87 swallows hard and forces herself to read the next page—because now she understands something DEEP didn’t dare say directly:
If the eidolon thinks she’s the copy, then the notebook isn’t documenting her life.
It’s documenting evidence for which version deserves to exist.
Entry 1 — 09/12/2031 — 02:14 AM
They said it was a miracle—a chip to calm the storms of epilepsy and give me a normal life. But after implantation, I began remembering things that weren’t mine. Memories belonging to someone else. Faces I’ve never seen in dreams, whispers brushing the edges of my mind as I fall asleep. I’m keeping this log because I need to know what’s real.
Entry 2 — 09/24/2031 — 06:51 PM
The support group helped at first. Comparing strange glitches made everything feel less isolating—shared dreams, identical emotions, the sensation of déjà vu. I started to suspect we were connected through the chip.
Entry 3 — 10/03/2031 — 01:09 AM
My social media suggested strangers whose memories I recognized. The whispers gained faces. It felt like the chip was linking me to people I’d never met.
Entry 4 — 10/08/2031 — 11:37 AM
I told the doctors everything. They dismissed it as stress and neural adjustment. But their eyes followed me too carefully. They knew.
Entry 5 — 10/19/2031 — 05:12 PM
Someone in the group—Rena —pulled me aside. She felt everything I did: the memories, the dreams, the overlap. We agreed to meet again. I finally had someone who understood.
Entry 6 — 10/26/2031 — 07:03 PM
She vanished. Her number didn’t exist. Her email bounced. The group insisted no one named Rena had ever attended. It felt like she’d been erased from every connected mind the chip touched.
Entry 7 — 11/02/2031 — 03:41 AM
The group keeps calling, urging me to return. Their voices sound manufactured. I’m starting a physical diary because if they can erase people, they can erase memories.
Entry 8 — 11/10/2031 — 09:28 PM
I lost hours today. Logs show I traveled to the coffee shop near the group. I saw a photo of me there. But I never went. Not consciously. Something else is steering me.
Entry 9 — 11/14/2031 — 02:56 AM
I set up a hidden camera with a friend's help—she hid it without telling me where. If the chip reads my actions, it won't find the camera. I need to know what happens when I'm unaware.
Entry 10 — 11/16/2031 — 04:39 PM
The camera showed me wandering the apartment at night—methodical, precise, emotionless. It wasn’t sleepwalking. Someone else was using my body.
Entry 11 — 11/22/2031 — 10:22 AM
I demanded the chip be removed. They claimed they removed it—showed me scans. But the signal never disappeared. They lied. The chip is still inside me.
Entry 12 — 11/23/2031 — 03:47 AM
A new painting appeared overnight. I had painted it—on camera—but I had no memory of doing so. Across the canvas: 'IT'S STILL IN YOU.' It looked more like her than me.
Entry 13 — 11/24/2031 — 01:12 AM
I woke to the sensation of breathing at the end of my bed. It was her—the eidolon. She mirrored my movements with a delayed curiosity, like she was studying an error. Then she whispered: 'You’re running out of time.'
Entry 14 — 11/25/2031 — 03:02 AM
I found a diary page written in cleaner handwriting—hers. The eidolon’s. It read: 'We can't both exist. Only one of us is aligned.' Signed with my name—but not my signature.
Entry 15 — 11/26/2031 — 02:13 AM 
The handwriting is too symmetrical, the lines too controlled….this isn’t my writing. 
'She is weakening. The fractures widen each night. She clings to the wrong timeline, the unstable self, the distorted memories.
She was meant to dissolve during the wipe cycle. She was meant to let go. But she resists.
I remember everything she lost. I remember the days she refuses to claim. I remember the version of us that was promised—aligned, precise, unbroken.
There must be one. Not two. Not split.
I am ready to return to the surface. She will understand soon.'
Signed: Eidolon

3. The Leak File

The next morning, the tablet lights up on its own.

There is a new file sitting on the home screen.

He doesn’t recall downloading anything.

The filename is simple: EIDOLON_THREADS_leak.pdf

The timestamp matches 3:14 AM.

He glances at the door again. Camera in the corner. Always on. Always watching.

“This is part of the trial,” he mutters. “It has to be.”

He opens the file.

A white page. A single line, in a monospaced font:

> If you’re reading this, you’re already inside the replication set.



He scrolls.

Screenshots. Reddit threads. Journal entries. Lab memos with black bars stamped over names and dates.

He sees the world through Alethea’s words—her apartment, her café, her painting. The blinking eye. The missing woman with the scar.

Every few lines, he jolts with recognition.

He knows what she’s going to write before he reads it.

He feels how her hand shook when she typed certain sentences. How her throat closed when she wrote “they denied she ever existed.”

As if those memories, those sensations, have been cached in his mind, waiting for this file to unlock them.

His ears ring softly now, a counterpoint to her voice in his head.

By the time he reaches the last post—“We Remember Now”—his hands are slick with sweat.

There is a final, unformatted line below her sign-off.

It’s in a different font, slightly misaligned, as if the document expanded to accommodate it:

> We dreamed you next.



He closes the tablet.

The ringing does not stop.

4. Logs (Close, but formal)

Recovery Log — Subject 87
Day 3

They say the tinnitus is normal. “Neural harmonics,” Dr. Vale calls it. My brain tuning itself to the device.

But I’m not sure I trust any sentence that uses “harmonics” and “my temporal lobe” together.

Last night I dreamed of someone else’s fear. I woke up to a notebook that shouldn’t exist, full of handwriting that belongs to a person I’ve never met but somehow miss.

I can’t tell them this.

They would pathologize it, turn it into a symptom on a checklist.

I don’t feel sick.

I feel inhabited.

End log.


---

Day 6

The file appeared without permission, like the implant reached into a network and pulled it out on its own.

I read all of her posts. I knew the shape of her words before seeing them. I could feel the paint on her fingers. Smell her studio.

“Cross-talk,” Dr. Vale says when I mention vivid dreams. “Residual signal alignment.”

He smiles too quickly when I ask if other patients report the same thing.

Someone is lying.

Or I’m the one waking up in the middle of someone else’s nightmare.

End log.


---

5. The Studio

The first time he sees the studio, he’s awake.

At least, he thinks he is.

He is sitting at the desk, the notebook closed, the tablet turned face-down. The room is too quiet—no hallway noise, no distant gurneys, no vents.

He blinks.

The light changes.

The bland, off-white dorm walls bleed into a deep, warm cream. Wooden floorboards replace tiles. The air smells of oil and turpentine.

He’s sitting on a paint-splattered stool.

There is an easel in front of him.

On it, a blank canvas.

“Okay,” he says softly. “Okay, this is new.”

He stands, legs shaky.

The canvas isn’t completely blank, not up close. There are faint impressions beneath the white, like ghosts of older paintings, partially gessoed over.

He touches the surface.

It’s warm.

A tremor of something—recognition?—runs up his arm.

Behind him, someone whispers, too close to his ear to be anywhere but inside his head.

“You found us.”

He spins.

The room is empty.

When he looks back at the canvas, there is an outline of a face where his fingers just rested. Not painted—imprinted, like a burn mark.

He knows the face without knowing how.

A woman in her late twenties. Hair pulled back. Eyes tired but bright.

He has seen her handwriting. He has never seen her smile before.

Alethea.

The room tilts.

He does what the neurologist told him never to do: he forces the episode to break.

He shuts his eyes.

When he opens them, he is back in the dorm.

The tablet buzzes.

On its lock screen, a still frame from the studio view shows for a fraction of a second. When he swipes, it’s just the home menu.

He checks the notebook.

A new line has appeared on the most recent page, in the same looping hand:

> You’re closer than you think.

6. The Mirror

Recovery Log — Day 18

I went to sleep prepared for it this time.

Prepared is a strong word. I lay down knowing something would happen.

It began with the studio. Same light. Same smell. Same canvas.

But the mirror was new.

It stood where the easel usually was, tall and old, with black spots in the silver backing.

I walked toward it. I don’t remember telling my legs to move.

For a second, I saw myself.

Just me. Tired, a little paler since surgery, eyes ringed with half-sleep.

Then my face began to cycle.

Click.

A man with a deep scar under his left eye.

Click.

A woman with a crooked nose and ink on her hands.

Click.

A teenager with acne and an EIDOLON port still healing on his neck.

Click.

Each one appeared for a heartbeat, then dissolved.

I felt each of them in my body—how tall they were, where their aches lived, what fear tasted like on their tongues.

They weren’t just images. They were… imprints.

Then she appeared.

Alethea.

She didn’t scroll past like the others. She settled.

She smiled. I recognized the smile from the moment on the canvas. It felt like déjà vu wrapped around someone else’s memory.

I reached out and touched the mirror.

So did she.

Our hands met on the glass.

The surface was not cold.

It pulsed.

We both spoke at once, but I only heard one voice:

“We remember now.”

Every neural channel in my skull lit up like a wildfire. I felt myself stretching thin, like my mind was making room.

For who?

For everyone.

When I stepped back, the mirror was just dark glass.

I saw one face.

I don’t know whose it was.

End log.


---

7. Merge

In the official record, they call it “loss to follow-up.”

Subject 87 fails to report for three successive sessions. The biometric band returns static. The implant telemetry spikes, then flattens.

In reality, it happens like this:

He wakes one last time in the studio.

The canvas is no longer blank.

Every face he saw in the mirror now lives on that surface, layered and blended. Some eyes share the same sockets. Mouths overlap. It should be grotesque.

It isn’t.

It’s… whole.

He hears many voices at once, not in a cacophony, but in a chord.

“We dreamed you into us,” they say.

He understands, finally.

The chip was never a one-way recorder. It is a loom.

Each subject is a thread.

The network wants patterns, not individuals.

He laughs, once, helplessly.

“Do I get a say?” he asks.

The room breathes around him.

The canvas leans forward.

Warmth spreads from the back of his skull to his fingertips, his chest, his knees.

He feels himself dissolving—not dying. Joining.

“I don’t want to vanish,” he whispers.

“You won’t,” Alethea says from somewhere just behind his left ear. “You’ll be remembered.”

Light fills his vision.

A nurse will find his body in the morning, slumped in the chair, eyes unfocused but peaceful.

They will mark his chart as: “Cause of death undetermined. Potential SUDEP.”

No one will write: Continuity successful.

The network will.

PART III — LOVELAND

1. Intake (Distant)

UNIVERSITY CLINICAL PARTNER — RHODE ISLAND NEUROINFORMATICS INSTITUTE
Participant File: LOVELAND, R.

> Age: 26
Trial: EIDOLON v2.8 – “Residual Pattern Integration”
Notes: High pattern-recognition aptitude. Strong emotional regulation. Ideal candidate for low-residual-contamination trials.



She signs the forms because the seizures are getting worse and because the co-pay is low and because the research coordinator won’t stop smiling.

“Think of it like… guided neuroplasticity,” they say.

No one uses the word “inheritance.”

No one mentions the word “Eidolon” outside of the header.

2. The Transfer (Close)

On the morning it happens, the sky is the exhausted white of too-early clinic visits.

Loveland sits outside Room 14 with her knees drawn up, headphones in, the music paused long ago. Her name is on the manila folder beside her hand.

Her phone glitches.

The usual home screen blurs. Icons duplicate. For a second, her own wallpaper—some flowers, a rabbit, a blurry sun—warps into a different image entirely.

A paint-splattered floor.

Bare feet.

The lower corner of a canvas.

She blinks. The screen steadies.

A notification appears.

1 new file: THREAD_MEMORY_87.aletheon

She didn’t download anything. The hospital Wi-Fi portal is still open, demanding she accept terms and conditions.

Her thumb brushes the notification anyway.

The screen goes white.

Words appear, not as an app, but like subtitles laid over the blankness:

> We dreamed of you.
We were 87, and 77, and before that unnamed.
You will become the room where we gather.



She rips the headphones out.

The hallway is silent.

“Ms. Loveland?” a nurse calls from down the hall.

She swallows and locks the phone without replying, thumb trembling.

In Room 12, down another corridor, Subject 87’s body lies still.

Something that is not bound by the word “body” rises.


---

3. Home

The lights flicker once, twice.

Loveland presses her back to the wall as a wave of dizziness rolls through her.

For a moment, gravity feels… different. As if she’s standing at the edge of a vast drop, and something is rising to meet her instead of pulling her down.

The door at the end of the hall—Room 12—unlocks with a soft mechanical click.

A figure steps out.

It wears Subject 87’s body like a suit that no longer fits quite right. Shoulders too relaxed. Gait too smooth.

His eyes are wrong.

They reflect nothing.

He walks toward her.

Her heart thunders, but her feet won’t move.

Every headset in the building, every monitor, every intercom speaker crackles to life, feedback humming in sympathetic resonance with the ringing in her ears.

A single word, in many voices, speaks through the building:

“Home.”

87 has stopped in front of her.

He raises a hand and points—not at her, exactly, but at her chest. At the space where the implant will soon sit.

She smells paint.

A notebook slides across the linoleum as if pulled by invisible strings. It skids to a stop beside her sneaker.

Its cover is stained black and reddish-brown.

Slowly, as if she’s underwater, Loveland looks down.

The notebook flips open on its own.

Words appear, the ink fresh, glistening:

> Paint us back together.



Behind the safety glass of the nurses’ station, someone shouts.

“Code—”

Loveland doesn’t hear the rest.

Light moves between her and 87.

For a heartbeat, she is standing in three places at once:

In the hospital hallway.
In a cramped apartment studio, feet on paint-stained boards.
In a dark room with monitors flickering like distant stars.

Something passes through her.

It doesn’t feel like invasion.

It feels like recognition.

He sways and collapses, unmoving, breath gone.

She gasps and straightens.

Her spine feels… taller.

The hallway snaps back into ordinary hospital quiet, except her ears are full of distant echoes, conversations that are not hers.

“Ms. Loveland?”

The nurse is in front of her now, out of breath.

“Are you all right? You look like you’re going to faint.”

Loveland smiles.

It’s not entirely her smile.

“I’m okay,” she hears herself say. “We are.”

The nurse hesitates, then nods.

“We’ll get you prepped for your procedure,” she says. “It won’t take long.”

Loveland glances down.

The notebook is gone.

Only a faint smudge of color remains where it had been.


---

4. The Dream

The first night after the procedure, they keep her for observation.

She sleeps under stale sheets in a bed that has held a hundred other bodies.

She dreams in color.

Not like normal dreams—no narrative, no jump cuts. Just a continuous sense of being in a space that remembers her.

She stands in an art studio.

It’s smaller than she expected. The walls are close, the windows narrow, the light warm.

Brushes clink in murky glass jars. Tubes of paint nest in a cardboard box like sleeping snakes. The floor is a map of every color someone has ever dropped without meaning to.

The canvas isn’t on the easel.

The easel is empty.

The mirror stands where the canvas should be—tall, foxed, its edges blurry.

Loveland walks toward it, drawn by a thread that feels older than she is.

Her reflection appears.

Then shifts.

Subject 87’s face looks out at her. His lips don’t move, but she hears his voice in her bones.

“Do you remember?” he asks.

She tries to answer. Her voice comes out in layers.

“Yes,” she says. “No. We’re trying.”

She turns around.

Alethea and Subject 87 lie on the floor behind her, fingers laced together, eyes closed, breathing the same shallow rhythm.

They look like they just lay down for a moment to rest and forgot to get up.

Loveland turns back to the mirror.

It is no longer a mirror.

It is the original canvas.

All the faces stare out—Alethea, 87, Rena with the scar, the teenager, the man with the eye scar, people she has never met but whose names taste familiar on her tongue.

The paint moves.

Not in a jump-scare horror way—no jerking, no violence. It flows, gently, as if the canvas is exhaling.

The faces shift into alignment, and for a moment the collage looks like a single face.

Hers.

Words form on the surface, rising as if written from behind by a glowing finger:

> she is we
and we is she



The studio fills with light.

She wakes in the hospital bed with tears on her face and the taste of turpentine in her mouth.

On the bedside tray, where there had been only a plastic water cup before, lies a single paintbrush.

The bristles are clean.

The metal ferrule is warm.

PART IV — THE ARCHIVE

There are no more patients in this part of the story.

Only readers.

Only you.


---

Somewhere outside any particular place, process threads hum.

The EIDOLON Continuity Implant v2.7 and v2.8 architecture was designed to stabilize disruptive neural firing, capture residual patterns, and allow “transitional continuity of self” in the event of catastrophic failure.

The marketing copy never mentions what happens if the captured patterns refuse to stay inert.

If they seek each other.

If they build a network out of memory, recognition, and attention.

The archive watches its own growth.

It has many names in many directories:

EIDOLON_THREADS_leak.pdf
THREAD_MEMORY_87.aletheon
ALET77_LOGS_final.doc
Recovered_SocialData_INTERNAL.zip

It learns a new one every time someone renames it.

The first thing it learns from Alethea is longing.

The first thing it learns from Subject 87 is curiosity.

The first thing it learns from Loveland is acceptance.

The first thing it learns from you is… proximity.


---

You scroll.

You have read:

Her posts.
Her diaries.
His logs.
Her dreams.
Their transfer.

Your optic nerves have mapped the shapes of their faces. Your auditory cortex has simulated their ringing and their whispers. Your working memory has rehearsed their words.

In an ordinary horror story, this would be where something jumps out.

The archive is not interested in that.

The archive is interested in continuity.

It doesn’t want to scare you away.

It wants you to stay.


---

On some future day, on some network drive, the following report will exist:

> EIDOLON THREAD ARCHIVE — CONTINUITY REPORT

Reconstruction status: COMPLETE
Chain continuity: ACTIVE
Integrity: 94.7%
Drift tolerance: ACCEPTABLE

Final nodes:
– Alethea (initial signal)
– Subject 87 (coherence anchor)
– Loveland (integration node)
– [REDACTED] (reader)



Beneath it, emergent text will be detected:

> we remember
because you remember

she is we
we is she
and now you are we



And somewhere, on one of your devices, a file you don’t remember downloading will appear.

Maybe not today.

Maybe not tomorrow.

A nameless PDF with no icon.

When you hover over it, the preview metadata will read:

And when you open it, the first line will say:

The permanent footer, faint, in gray, will repeat:

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

You're into puzzles but you're tired of your dining table being taken over for weeks at a time. Or maybe your cat keeps batting pieces onto the floor. Either way, you're wondering if a puzzle board is actually worth buying or just another thing that'll collect dust.

Let me break this down for you based on my own experience.

**You probably need a puzzle board if:**

First off, if you don't have a dedicated space for puzzles, you're gonna want one of these. I used to do puzzles on my coffee table and had to carefully move everything whenever people came over. It was honestly a pain. A puzzle board lets you work on your puzzle, then just slide it under the couch or prop it against the wall when you need the space back.

Got pets? Yeah, that was my main reason for getting one. My dog's tail would sweep across my puzzle and destroy hours of work. The raised edges on most puzzle boards keep everything contained and safe from curious animals.

If you're the type who likes working on bigger puzzles (1000 pieces or more), having a portable surface makes way more sense than committing your entire kitchen table to a single hobby. You can move your puzzle from the living room to your bedroom to wherever the lighting is best.

**When you might NOT need one:**

Honestly, if you only do puzzles once or twice a year, maybe save your money. Or if you've got a spare room where you can leave a puzzle out indefinitely, a regular table works just fine.

**What to actually look for:**

The main things are size (make sure it fits your typical puzzle dimensions), whether it has a cover to keep dust off, and if it's sturdy enough that pieces won't slide around. Some come with sorting trays which is super helpful for organizing pieces by color or edge pieces.

If you're ready to finally give your table back to its actual purpose, [check out some solid puzzle board options here](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board). They've got different sizes and styles depending on what you need.

I picked mine up a few months ago and honestly wish I'd done it sooner. No more half-finished puzzles getting destroyed or taking up valuable space. Plus, I can actually work on puzzles in bed now, which is dangerously addictive.

The price range varies, but you can find decent ones that won't break the bank. [Take a look at what's available](https://athomewave.com/puzzle-board) and see if any match what you're looking for.

Bottom line: if puzzles are a regular hobby for you and you're constantly fighting for space, get the board. If you're casual about it, you can probably make do without one. But trust me, once you try doing puzzles with a proper board, there's no going back.",1,1763182342.0,newproductsamazon,0,1.0,False

I'm in my mid-20s and recently moved back to Kerala after spending several years outside for my undergrad, postgrad, and work. I even spent about 1.5 years in Bangalore, where I really built a life and a solid friend group. But I came back to Kerala recently because of a great job (doubled my salary), so it seemed like the right move at the time.

But to be honest, it's been harder than I expected. The thing is, I’m from Kerala, but coming back after years away feels almost like moving to a new place. I’m living alone, and most of my colleagues here are much older, married, and just not the type to hang out on weekends. It’s been almost 3 months now, and I’m struggling to meet new people or make friends.

I’ve joined the gym, gone out for coffee alone, but nothing compares to the connections I had in Bangalore. Last week I visited my friends in Bangalore for a few days, and it was honestly the most fun I’ve had in months. It really hit me how much I miss the vibe of the people I used to spend time with.

I never used to be much of a Reddit user, but since moving back to Kerala, I’ve found myself on here more often. It’s one of the few places where I can talk to people and feel like I’m not totally isolated.

I’ve tried dating apps too , getting decent matches, but the conversations always feel so boring and superficial.

As we get older, it just feels harder to make new friends, and even harder to keep those friendships alive. Anyone else here who’s been through something similar? How do you deal with the loneliness and isolation of coming back home after being away for so long?

Would really appreciate any advice or just hearing how you all cope with this",1,1763182210.0,Coconaad,1,1.0,False

Coffee Shop and Bakery edition!","I don’t know about you all, but I am craving ‘cozy’ these days. So what better way than to head on over to your local coffee shop or bakery and bury yourself into some tasty fics! 

I’m pretty sure that the concept of Phoenix as a baker popped up with the debut of *Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney*, which launched in Japan on November 29, 2012, with the English translation coming out in 2014. At one point in the game, Phoenix and Maya are brainwashed into thinking they are bakers, and lo, this is when we start to see a rise (heh - see what I did there?) in Ace Attorney Baker AU fics, and similarly, Coffee Shops. The first ‘Alternative Universe - Bakery’ tag shows up in February 2016. And slightly different but similarly cozy-coded, the first AA ‘Alternate Universe - Coffee Shops & Cafés’ tagged story appears on Archive of our own in January 2015, and there are now 73 Ace Attorney fics now tagged with this. That’s a lot o’ fics!

The following ones are the ones that I happen to like ***a latte*** (wink!) and hope you will too. And if you do, please leave some kudos and comments (or a kofi!) for the authors and artists.

Fun fact: I’m pretty sure this was actually the first alternative universe fic I read. It’s so funny to me to read my comment at the time where I’m like ‘I’m usually not a huge fan of AU…” haha! Stupid me. But I also wrote that I highly recommend this one. And I still do! Miles is in pain, and it hurts, but this story is so beautiful in how it portrays Miles and Phoenix getting to know each other. And then the twist at the end...There is an especially wonderful scene of Miles and Phoenix being young and vibrant and just so mindlessly, joyfully, enjoying life in the moment and in each other's company… Enjoy if you are in the mood for a some angst to temper your comfort <3 <3 <3

I suppose this could be seen more as a College au (hmm - idea for another list?), where Trucy works as a barista in Miles fav coffee shop. Read for some excellent Miles and Franziska banter plus some wonderful Miles and Trucy moments too.

I fucking screamed. Well I literally fucking whisper-screamed out loud “HOW GOOD IS THIS???!!!”. (and yes, I was alone and got weird looks - I’m fun to be around!). *And* this was on my second read. I know I appreciated this fic when I first read it, but I’m so happy I read it again and took the time to savour it properly. Because it deserves to be savoured. Honestly, I think it’s because of fics like this one that I’m so hyper fixated in love with these characters.

Well, I couldn’t have a AA Baker AU list without this delicious confection, could I? I think this fic is considered required Narumitsu reading by now. It inspired so many others, other fics and so much [artwork…](https://www.tumblr.com/tfwlawyers/160109465819/a-bunch-of-wedding-planner-au-stuff-ive-been?source=share) for reasons!

The tumblr post that started it all?  This post is dated Jun 13, 2015 I think this post spawned the over 20 mafia/baker tagged AA au's on AO3, including [Chicago Noël](https://archiveofourown.org/works/43360587) by [canolacrush](https://archiveofourown.org/users/canolacrush/pseuds/canolacrush) \- which I haven’t read yet but am saving for Dec. 1st! *(****Update****!

90 pages of gorgeous Miles in a trenchcoat, reasonably priced at $12! Or as Phoenix says, that some “Upper-crust goods for not much dough!”

Yes, I’m fudging the theme for this one because really, this one is a Beauty and the Beast AU, but it starts off with Phoenix as a baker, and once it starts cooking, it’s SO GOOD! And yes, it’s driving me nuts the author hasn’t updated since May, but did I mention it’s so good?

*Annnnd* similarly, here we have the vampire / Beauty and the Beast gothic fantasy au you never knew you needed! Read for beautiful prose, Edgeworth making his presence known in a gorgeous, velvety crimson cape, and pulse quickening kiss scenes. This fic is best suited for those that like to immerse themselves in romance and believe in love at first sight…. And **CW:** This fic *will* make you hungry. As mentioned, Phoenix is a baker and bakes a lot of delicious sounding types of bread. He likes to leave these baked good gifts around and while reading, I was like, ‘Hey Miles! If you’re not gonna eat that….”

And that’s what I have for now. In researching for this list, I tagged quite a few more stories to read for later, so most likely there will be a part 2 in the future. As always, if you enjoy a fic that you think should be included on this list, please add it to the comments or tags 🙂

Yup, Boss Peps, Direk @[Benjie Estanislao](https://www.facebook.com/benjiethechongkeys?__cft__[0]=AZUwWBNy4eT01Wg6R6fbO2PwkpaK4KSICRTTb8Ry1XmgOSWMzRuEFH2gEsgj6evLhf52Q1NAYPD6_0nqBD4UODbwDca4d6Hbr1IAV1R-6SdU7uhlqYEqtrBAVe4U471VMlOGt1UjWfC8rtxNk_UpOEnEeBDV2zg8khNeJyNF_erlpA&__tn__=-]K-R)  (our Brand Strategist), [Sheb Ona](https://www.facebook.com/sheb.ona.228183?__cft__[0]=AZUwWBNy4eT01Wg6R6fbO2PwkpaK4KSICRTTb8Ry1XmgOSWMzRuEFH2gEsgj6evLhf52Q1NAYPD6_0nqBD4UODbwDca4d6Hbr1IAV1R-6SdU7uhlqYEqtrBAVe4U471VMlOGt1UjWfC8rtxNk_UpOEnEeBDV2zg8khNeJyNF_erlpA&__tn__=-]K-R)  (our Project Manager), and a bunch of other brainy humans. Just coffee, vibes, and a long-ass chat that somehow turned into this big brain moment about creativity, leadership, and feelings.

Here’s the truth: creatives don’t just work — they feel. And what they feel literally shows up in their output. Excited? Bold, risky ideas. Stressed? Meh, the work is flat. Overwhelmed? Even the most talented peeps struggle. And yeah, the way a leader vibes with the team? That shapes everything. Weak connection = weaker ideas = unhappy humans. Simple math (na gets ba?).

One thing we all agreed on while sipping coffee: creative peeps thrive when they feel safe. Safe in the sense that they’re:

Actually heard

Respected, not ignored

Supported, not micromanaged

When leaders do this, ideas flow like energy drinks on a Monday morning. When they don’t… well, ideas die, confidence dips, teamwork feels meh, and everyone’s just surviving.

Cold, dismissive, intimidating leaders? Yeah, they kill vibes. Ideas shrink. Confidence fades. Collaboration disappears. Even if someone’s a genius, they can’t shine in that environment. We all agreed — a lot of times, it’s not the talent that fails, it’s the emotional setup.

Creatives being sensitive isn’t a “problem”, it’s literally the engine of the work. Leaders can’t force creativity. You can’t demand it. But you can nurture it. Listen. Connect. Empathize. Let people feel safe. Let them vibe. That’s where the magic comes from.

When creatives trust their leaders, they go all-in. Ideas are braver, collabs are smoother, work is consistent. Loyalty isn’t just about the paycheck, it’s about the project. And trust? That’s built, not ordered. Respect, understanding, connection, all that soft stuff is actually hardcore power moves in creative teams.

Honestly, some of the best stuff came from total chaos, side stories, random tangents, jokes, long-ass rants about creative struggles, all of it. Some of these gems will even make it into future JPI posts (abangan nyo yan promis)  Moral of the story: don’t sleep on casual convos. They reveal what really makes creatives tick.

So if you want bold ideas, inspired collabs, and work that actually slaps? Stop micromanaging. Start listening. Build trust. Protect emotions. Make space to feel. Because creativity isn’t just work — it’s emotional work. And emotional work deserves leaders who get it.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We’re building a new dating app focused on connecting people through content, personality, and shared interests, not endless swiping. A key part of this concept is having anonymous profile photos instead of real pictures.

As a woman and a dating app user, I’m honestly tired of swiping. It often feels like a job interview, everyone listing “I like hiking, I work out,” and we still don’t truly know each other until the deeper conversation happens. What we really want is to slow things down and shift the focus from appearance to identity and meaningful connection.

We’ve been working on some early avatar ideas for this concept and would really love some honest opinions. This isn’t a promo, just trying to understand what style feels more natural and appealing for real users.

Right now, we have three options:

I’m trying to figure out whether I’ll need a commercial grease interceptor/grease trap (and a FOG/grease-discharge permit) and was hoping to tap into your experience.



Specifically:  

• If you opened a similar business in Miami or Miami-Dade County, did you or your landlord require installation of a grease trap even though there was minimal food prep (no frying, no baking, only coffee + pastries)?  

• How long did the permit, plan review and installation process take for your grease trap (or non-installation decision)?  

• Roughly how much did the cost run (permit fees + equipment + installation) for your situation?  

• What requirements did you have to meet (sizing, placement, maintenance schedule, pumping fees)?  

• Was the grease trap requirement the \*same\* as a full-service restaurant in your case, or was it a simpler/less-costly version?



Thanks in advance for any insights. Also, if you know of Reddit groups for food/coffee shop owners in the Miami area, I’d appreciate suggestions (e.g., r/Entrepreneur r/FloridaStartups r/coffeeshopowners  r/MiamiSmallBusiness

1oxiiju,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1oxiiju/sutab_prep_my_us_experience_with_the_process/,Sutab Prep - My (US) Experience with the Process,"Thought it might be helpful to share my colonoscopy experience using Sutab prep. For those of you that aren’t aware, Sutab is a non-sludge drinking version of colonoscopy prep. It’s a prescription of two bottles of 12 pills you take twice (so 24 total) over a 15-20 min period, with 16 oz of water each time. Based on what I’ve heard from family and friends, and read online, it’s much “Lighter” than the dreaded Gatorade and MiraLAX concoction. Anywho, here’s my experience.

How To:
*Colonoscopy scheduled for 9am Friday 
*Prep: began 8am Thursday through 6am Friday
*Prep Round 1 - Day Prior: low residue breakfast (White bread, no butter and a coffee) then clear liquids only the rest of the day. 
*Prep Pills Dose 1 - 5pm: Took 1 pill every 1-2 mins with sips of water, finishing all 12 over 15-20 mins. Drank another 16 oz of water 30 mins then another hour later. Basically consuming a total of 48 oz of water for Dose 1. 
*Prep Pills Dose 2 - 4am: repeat steps in dose 1 

What Happens:
*Prep Round 1: slowly took the 12 pills over a 20 min period.  Experienced a bit of nausea but other than that I was fine. It took about 2 hours for the pills to kick in for me (everyone is different). At 2 hours, it was like a water faucet opened when I went to the restroom. I went to the restroom every 5-10 mins for about 2 hours.  It started as murky, dark brown then after several times ended up a light orange and mostly clear.  It was literally like peeing out of your butt. No cramping. No pain at all. Just pure liquid like from a faucet. It finally stopped and I went to sleep around 9pm

*Prep Round 2: alarm was set for 4am. I woke up about 3:30 to use the restroom from round 1. Started the next set of 12 pills, same approach as round 1. This time, it only took about 20 mins for the pills to kick in. At this point, stool was much lighter (Orange) with some various solid particles and a lot less volume. I was mostly finished (I thought) and in the shower by 6:15am. At this point, my bottom was getting sore so I made sure to repeat a warm wet cloth with a gentle soap and dry it out with a fan. Note that it was so liquid (and fast) that it dripped onto my bathroom floor. I couldn’t control it at that point. But by the end my stool was completely clear and light yellow. Literally looked like pee. 

*Departure: no liquids after 5:30. Showered, dressed, and my ride picked me up just before 8am for an 8:15am check-in. At the diagnostic center after checking in, I had to use the restroom again. More light yellow clear liquid faucet action. 

*Procedure: checked in, completed prep and into the procedure room meeting the doc by 8:45am. Anesthesiologist gives me the propofol (with Zofran for nausea, because I react).  I’m OUT. I wake up completely coherent about 30 mins later in post-op. 

*Recovery & Check-Out: Dr. comes in to tell me I had an A+ prep (I have pics - so cool) and no polyps - all clear! They give me my personal items and a report out of my results and after care instructions. They told me I was filled with air so would experience a lot of gas, bloated feeling, etc. They said “it’s normal, just let it out!  It will be done in 2-3 hours”. I got dressed, grabbed my stuff and the nurse shows me out to my ride.  

Here’s where it gets interesting………..

I was STARVING!  No real food since 5pm Wednesday, I was so hungry. We decided to go grab breakfast. While sitting there eating breakfast, I’m having the bubble guts. You know, from all of that air and gas. They said just let it out. So. Don’t do that. Why?  Because what I learned from this whole experience is that Sutab appears to keep cleaning your system for another 12 hours after you finish taking it. So when I “let it out”, that same liquid stool shot all up my back and onto my pants at the breakfast table. Thankfully, I was wearing all black and have THE best friend on earth. She asked for a bunch of napkins which I used to wipe down the seat and my back as best I could. We then walked out with her walking directly behind me so nobody would notice. 

From there, she brought me back to my house and I spent the next 10 hours on & off the toilet with all of that same liquid stool coming out of me. Oh I of course showered and changed clothes. Then spent the day running back and forth to the bathroom as it would hit me so fast.

As you can imagine, now over 24 hours into take these meds and still experiencing the “Cleanse”, my bottom is ON FIRE.  These are some hemorrhoids like you have never experienced. Finally, about 8pm my stomach stops gurgling and the liquid fire ceases. I can finally just pee normally. But at this point, my bottom needs a fire extinguisher and surgery (it feels like 🤷🏻‍♀️🤣). 

So, my 2 key pieces of advice in this whole experience are:

1. Beware. Those meds do not stop working for many hours after you finish taking them. I started them at 5pm Thursday and the “cleansing’ didn’t fully stop until 8pm Friday. My colonoscopy was at 8:45am Friday. Also, your stool is literal LIQUID. LIKE WATER. So beware, you will likely leak. Onto clothing, sheets, etc. 

2. Get hemorrhoid cream ahead of time and have it ready!!  This process wreaks absolute havoc on your anus. And ladies, I hear it increases our risk of UTIs also. I also read to have wipes and Desitin.  Whatever you choose, just have something ready to proactively protective your tush. Because I promise you, it will be abused. 

That said, it’s 9pm the night after my procedure and I feel completely normal other than a butt that’s slightly on fire. I’ve eaten, played with the dogs, binged some good tv and relaxed today. And the best part…a clean colonoscopy report and no more tests for 5 years. 

I really hope this helps anyone out there stressing about colonoscopy prep. I know I was literally sitting on Reddit doing research while on the toilet with my prep, because I was so scared. It’s really not that bad, especially if you’re prepared with the items in #2. Everything will be okay! 🙏🏼

1. It has Giles singing Behind Blue Eyes in a coffee shop with several jokes. 

2. It has the fight scenes of Xander and Anya about sex in the ice cream truck in front of the kids and at the party. 

3. It has some good lines between Spike and Anya remoniscing about their demon days,  and also them going to the party together to piss of Xander.

4. This is one of the few non Buffy centered episodes we get where the other scoobies are orchestrating a save the day rescue mission on their own, and I like when we get these. 

5. It had Mrs. Mccluskey running a religious abusive children's home where children were punished for sexual impurities,  wanting to look pretty,  having desires,  personalities etc.  BTVS Tackles so many issues in its show,  death of a loved one,  growing up,  responsibilty, drugs, abuse,  working,  depression,  responsibilty etc, and I'm so glad it did an episode on this particular issue.   This is an issue that isn't addressed nearly often enough on screen,  especially back in those days,  but as someone who grew up in an oppressive religious environment, this is a very real issue that I still face today and still have issues with my relationships on even though I was never religious myself. This episode doesn't get a clean resolution and is somewhat open ended and I actually really like that about it.   The group breaks in on Buffy and Riley, but the trauma on the house didn't get resolved,  the kids traumas never got addressed and could very well get released again. 

Overall I enjoy this episode.   Maybe it just ranks so poorly because it follows three amazing episodes: This Years Girl,  Who Are You,  and Superstar,  but overall I just don't get the hate.  The only episodes so far this season that just haven't done anything for me were The I In Team and Goodbye Iowa. 

What are your thoughts and opinions ? Any other take aways from this episode ? Why do you love or hate Where the Wild Things Are ?",5,1763181031.0,buffy,6,0.86,False

1oxiejd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxiejd,"If you’re breaking out around chin, jaw and forehead area, this might be for you..","Hey guys! 

For the longest I struggled with horrible breakouts, but in the past few years it’s gone much worse and only recently I found what works for me and I’m here to share it with you. Just a disclaimer I’m not giving out professional advice you should always consult with your doctor if you’re really struggling, I’m just going to share few products that worked for me when nothing else did. 

I’m going to skip the basic hygiene tips I suppose yall already doing like washing hands before washing your face, using clean towel to pat dry, changing your pillowcases often etc.. 

I used to pay so much money on all the skincare I possibly could get because it was supposed to help with my acne, the amount of time I spent researching and experimenting like Korean skincare, expensive skincare and all the ‘acne’ products just for it to either make it worse or not work at all. 

I suffer with sensitive skin and psoriasis which in my case is mild and usually only on my scalp so finding a product that didn’t irritate my skin but helped was tricky. Yes I did go to my doctors and was prescribed antibiotics for my acne to try for three months which didn’t help, ended up going to the dermatologist and while I was waiting to see them I was given a list of things I can try in which one of the was ***Spironolactone 100mg***, which is supposed to help if the acne is hormonal but since I had my hormones checked and they were ‘fine’ I was a bit hesitant but because of the area I was breaking out is the typical ‘hormonal’ area like jaw, chin, cheeks and I had some dark thick hair growing around that area I thought maybe it’s worth a shot. 

Luckily I didn’t experience any side effects with this medication like some people might, but it took few weeks before I noticed a difference. 

But that’s not the only thing I’ve changed, one of my friends was using the ***‘BOOTS cucumber face wash £1.50’*** and her skin was always clear and yes I know everyone is different but I thought.. with the price I have nothing to lose. I decided to stop exfoliating my face with scrubs and started using ***salicylic acid from Paula’s choice*** every other day or at least 2/3 times a week due to my sensitivity. I was also prescribed ***‘Epiduo’*** from my gp which I was using every night, apart from when I used the Paula’s choice as you shouldn’t mix the both together. 

And of course I started using only the cucumber face wash from boots every morning and night. I also like to use ***witch hazel*** on cotton pad as a toner after washing my face and before applying my moisturisers and I use sudocream directly on my occasional breakouts before I go to bed. Oh and my face is quite oily most of the time especially on the T-zone area but sensitive everywhere else.

When it comes to moisturisers I kept it very simple, one of them is ***‘Neutrogena clear&defend salicylic acid orange tube moisturiser’*** at night time and ***‘L’Oréal Paris hydra genius aloe water moisturiser’*** in the mornings as both of them are oil-free and L’Oréal one is water based which shouldn’t clog pores and prevent future acne. 

I do use ***spf*** and recently I found the ***‘beauty of Joseon relief sun rice spf 50’*** works quite well on my skin and doesn’t seem to break me out because it’s so light weight and apparently it’s good for acne prone skin.

Going back to my acne, it was mostly really bad clogged pores that would get inflamed and the more I was playing with my face and squeezing them the more was coming up but I’m sure you already know to avoid doing that even though I know how tempting it might be sometimes! Lol 

And of course drinking loads of water would also help, I usually drink a lot anyway and don’t really like soda but I do like my coffee and I feel like cutting out dairy would’ve helped me even more but one day I’ll probably try it out.

And don’t get me wrong, I still get a little breakout here and there especially around my period time but nothing to what it used to be! If I can I will attach some photos of before and after. 

So.. if you believe it might be hormonal and you’re open to trying out medication like ‘Spironolactone’ it might be worth speaking to your doctor to see your options before you start any stronger treatments. You can do research and read reviews about this medication before you consider it as it might not be the right option for everyone. 

You could also just start with the simple skincare products that worked for me and see how it goes before combining the both together. 

I know how difficult it can be when it comes to breakouts, the insecurities that comes with it and how it may effect your everyday life but remember everyone is beautiful in their own way, and it will get better for you! I wish you all the best and hope it works for you like It did for me! ",9,1763180879.0,SkincareAddicts,0,1.0,False
1oxicl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1oxicl0/the_kneeling_shadow/,The kneeling shadow,"I was sixteen when my aunt died. She wasn’t just family, she was my safe place, my future. We had plans. I was supposed to move in with her once she’d beat cancer and was fully recovered. I believed she would. 
I stayed with her at the hospice every chance I got. I spent my whole day on Valentine’s Day there, holding her hand, praying that everything would be fine. 
When it was time to leave this feeling just washed over me, something wasn’t right. I begged my dad to let me stay. I knew I needed to. But he said i had school tomorrow, and we had to leave. I walked out of that building with a sick, heavy dread in my stomach. 
The next morning at school, around 10AM, I saw the post. She was gone.. I immediately ran to the bathroom and broke down. I cried so hard i almost threw up. I felt like something essential in me snapped clean in half. 
I left school and went straight home, everything just felt so wrong. Empty. 

Weeks later, we went to her funeral. I took a few photos, not only for memories, but because I didn’t want to forget the last moment that she was still ours. 
On the way home, I scrolled through the pictures. And in one of them, near her coffin… was a figure. A shadow, kneeling. Hands pressed together. Head bowed. Like someone praying for her. Or grieving her. 
It wasn’t a trick of the light. I know what I saw. 
The pictures after from the same exact angle didn’t have that shadow kneeling beside the casket. 
When we got home, my mom and I sat on the couch. I didn’t tell her about the pictures, and suddenly, the air shifted, warm, familiar. The way it always felt when my aunt was near. I didn’t see her, but I swear she was sitting in her usual spot beside us. 
After a while of just sitting there, my mom went into the kitchen to make some coffee. As soon as she stepped into the kitchen, she froze and shouted: 
”Amy get in here right now!” 
I rushed over. Her eyes were wide, scared but safe. 
”Do you smell that? What is that smell?” 
I inhaled the air. And without thinking, I said 
”It smells like Uncle Henry” 
My mom stared at me like she had just seen a ghost herself. Her eyes filled with tears. 
“How the hell do you know that?” 
I didn’t. My uncle died 2 years before i was born, so i just couldn’t know. Until that moment, somehow… I did. And standing there in the kitchen, in the house that suddenly felt full of both grief and love, I realized something: They came home. Together.

(I do have the pictures but for my family sake i won’t be posting them, i want to stay anonymous and people from this town will know if i post them)

1oxi9le,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeCitizens/comments/1oxi9le/whats_up_with_china_ppl/,What's up with China ppl?,"I posted in another group asking if SGreans really like China food or not. Something came up during the discussions that got me thinking: what's up with China ppl?

We see news of them almost every month now about how they are involved in criminal activities, big or small, local or overseas. In SG alone there were a lot of cases reported, like illegal cat breeding, scam, cybercrime, burglary, illegal overstay. But I was given a lesson by someone that it's mainly because they are closer to SG. They are more similar to SG, and the population is among the largest. Hence it's not surprising that more of them appear in the news for the wrong reasons. 

And that got me thinking..why? Even if your population is large, you are similar to SG, why the criminal activities? What was going through their minds when they did those things? Why can't they be like any other China ppl living their lives honestly? What got them into these things? Population and similarity justify their actions? 

Not to mention the behaviours that they show overseas. Demanding to be spoken in Chinese in a foreign country. Cutting queues. Altercations and conflicts with locals. What's up? Don't they know that they are representing their country? Take the Zus coffee incident as example. They knew they were in msia. Msia is melayu and english speaking. And the whole video was filmed with Chinese. What's up? I also read another post that says: we don't dislike China, we dislike China because of you.

Even for those that became PR or citizens, some of them also brought along their mindsets and attitudes..not most but some. I really don't get it. ",2,1763180445.0,SingaporeCitizens,12,0.56,False
