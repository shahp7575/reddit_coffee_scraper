1gau1gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1gau1gn/this_crush_is_killing_me/,This crush is killing me…,"I don't even know where to start. I've been in the same relationship since I was in my early 20s. Over time, I've come to realize that my current partner is holding me back in life. I feel terrible for it, but it's true. It all came to a head recently. I tried to leave, but I felt horrific after and then decided therapy could be an option. It's not working... and here's why.

A little over a year ago, I met someone through an interest group. At first we had minimal interaction, but over time we started talking more and more. We spent some time together as budding friends do. Around this time my partner was going through another tough time where they were unable to work or contribute to the household.

By comparison, this other person is successful, happy in their life and most importantly, independent. My partner is almost completely dependant on me, to the point that some days I'm practically a parent. I started wondering what it would be like to be with someone that wanted me, but didn't need me all the time.

Suddenly it all clicked in my head and I realized that it was a crush. Not a harmless one either. I haven't acted on it and given the personal code of honor my crush has, if they're interested (which more than one friend in my life thinks they are) they won't pull moves on me... but it's a strong one. I find myself thinking about them all the time. We spent an afternoon in a coffee shop one day, each working on our own thing. It was magical. Together but alone, I have never felt more at ease. It got me to wondering what spending an evening wrapped in a blanket together watching a movie would be like... or what it would be like to share a kiss...

My current partner is now getting on their feet a bit but it's be a decade of me basically being a sole provider and caregiver. I'm so tired. I don't think I can go on. I want to walk away but feel completely trapped. If I do, then my current partner has to fend for themselves for the first time. Really! They've been with me since they were 19. If I don't, I'm worried I'll be losing the chance at a future I want. A relationship where both people are adults, not one parenting the other. A relationship where we can do our own thing in the same room, content in the presence of each other, but not demanding of all my free time.

I feel like a horrible person. I want these feelings to go away, but at the same time... I don't want them to stop. I want them to get stronger and see how they go.",1,1729742814.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I've posted on here before about the abject grief I felt in the immediate aftermath of my wife's scorched earth policy.  This morning I woke up feeling very frustrated with my attorney, with whom I'm increasingly unimpressed.

I've recently rededicated myself anew to work, I'm back on a steady lifting program at the gym, and I decided to give Tinder a shot this past weekend.  Lo and behold I had a really pleasant coffee date with a wonderful woman this afternoon who's also navigating her own divorce.  She's lovely, we share a lot in common, and we're going on a dinner date next week.  I'm not ready to rush into anything, but connecting with someone, however brief, felt great.

I've lived in this place for like four months now and I have no idea how to actually decorate. It looks like I just moved in, and it still definitely looks like a college starter room.

I like to keep the middle clear because that's where I do my yoga, but I should probably put a rug there. I'm also trying to keep it cat-friendly as well. But the good news is that my landlord doesn't care about putting nails into the walls. 

  
My current ideas: replace the window blind with white curtains, I don't know how but hide the bed box. Add in hanging plants (there's some weird hooks hanging from the ceiling anyway). Maybe another lamp somewhere?

Hi all for suggestions tips ideas or anything along that line on setting my desk at work 

I am in a tech Role. 
My team of 5 is currently situated in an old office in an old building. 

We are seated side by side. 
Current our desk is extremely small! And we aren’t issued monitors by default. The desk comes with a old cabinet at the top 

My current desk can only fit the following 

1 x 22 inch extremely old Dell monitor which i “chori-ed”; it was lying around in the office so i grabbed it, it has no other input expect VGA - that’s how old it is so i have to use converters 

1 x 22 inch old dell monitor which I purchased 2nd hand, came with a green line running across the Center of the screen, similar to the above no other input expect VGA so I have to use converters 

1 x MX Master 3 - love the mouse, but using without the Logitech application as I don’t have the admin rights to install it 

1x cheap Bluetooth full sized  mechanical keyboard, which I bought from shoppe for 40 dollars, it’s extremely tiring to type with 


That’s all my desk can fit anything more than that it will fall off the desk.

I have to put the laptop into the cabinet and run cables as such There are cables dangling here and there.

Also we don’t have a pantry, I go thru at least 3 cups of iced kopi a day, which I from the bakery nearby for 2 dollars which is served with a thick plastic cups - very costly and expensive I know, but I don’t have a pantry.

My team is being shifted to a new office. 
With a new desk and has a pantry 

My new desk, is L shaped and “movable” the height of it can be adjusted to a standing desk or sitting desk, it has drawers and cabinets. And has a sea view 
In my role I need a minimum of 2 monitors to do work. 3 would be great.
Since I am not provided a monitor,

I am thinking if I should reuse the 2 old monitors I already have, which in general does the job. 
(My role requires me to work mainly on a terminal so it’s blank screen with white words most of the time. )
Or purchase new ones? If I should purchase new ones, which would be a good option ? 

And I definitely need a new keyboard, which would be great for productivity? 

If my organisation allowed it, I would have went with MX keys, but Since they don’t allow it. I don’t know if that is a good choice. Hoping Logitech develops a portable version of Logitech options 


I also highly doubt the new pantry is gonna have ice, but what would be a good coffee option ?
I don’t really fancy the Nescafe 3 in 1. 
I love Bru, but bru has no kick

1gatt65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1gatt65/list_of_things_mil_has_done/,List of Things MIL Has Done ,"I’m almost at the end of my first pregnancy. MIL has been on my nerves since the very beginning. She lives far away and came up to visit with us for a week, just when I was newly pregnant. Because she’s a big drinker, we felt the need to tell her I was pregnant because she would’ve realized otherwise since I wouldn’t be having any wine with her the whole visit. I had a loss prior, and not once did she reach out and ask how I was doing. But now that this pregnancy has been sailing along, she’s been up my ass and it’s been horribly irritating. 

During her visit:

-took it upon herself to take down our front outdoor wreath (all season) and decorate it with Easter eggs and birds for Easter. She also went out and bought other Easter decor and decked out our coffee table with it. Didn’t ask, just did both. Then proceeded to tell me how easy it is and fun to change up wreaths yourself. Uh okay. 

-got drunk one night and asked if she would be okay moving in with us and that we would never have to pay for child care. She’s single and getting older. She also has two other kids who aren’t having babies, but her reasoning is “my grandkids are my occupation” … they aren’t even born yet. 

-every little moment she would comment on whether I looked or felt nauseous or not. Example, “oh! she’s sick again!” If I would go quiet. I was horribly sick during my first trimester and she didn’t have morning sickness for any of her pregnancies. Almost felt like she didn’t believe I was sick. 

-took over our kitchen to cook nonstop and made meals to freeze. Nice gesture, but the smell of the cooking made me so sick. And it felt very invasive to have our entire kitchen taken over by her the entire time. 

When she got back home, the constant texts began. She wasn’t like this before, but again because I’m pregnant, I’m (or more like baby) is now the sole focus of her life. 

-every couple of days asking how I’m feeling. “Still nauseous?” It was so irritating to have to answer to her millions of questions and keep affirming that yes, I’m still nauseous. She even asked me what medication I was on, googled it, asked her friend about it, then came back to tell me it is a good one and it helps etc. 

-questions becoming more invasive. Like “are you gaining weight? Is the baby gaining weight? Are you eating healthy? Exercise?” 

-if I shared a photo on my story of an ultrasound, or anything for that matter - she would be the first person to view it and privately comment something. “New photo???!” Even when it was the same photo we had already sent. I stopped sending her any because it got so annoying. Not everything I post needs a comment from her. 

-she bought a bunch of French books for the baby without asking. Before I was ever pregnant, she sobbed to us about how important it is for her future grandchildren to speak French. She barely speaks English and French is my hubby’s first language, but I am not fully fluent. This really irritated and hurt me because it feels like she’s trying to ensure my son speaks a language his own mother doesn’t. 

-recently posted a bump pic and an ultrasound photo of him doing a cute little yawn. Everyone else comments on how cute he is, complimenting me etc… she’s the only one who comments about herself. “Looks like he might be a singer, he won’t have gotten that from me!” No shit, you’re not his mom. Just be normal. 

-for a while she was referring to him as “her little man”. That’s what my husband and I refer to him as. It was bugging me so much because she would text me to “say hi to her little man”
For her, tell him she loves him etc. making me feel like an incubator. My husband finally told her to stop, and that he’s not hers and she said “well… he’s mine too a little bit”. 🙄 he told her no, and if she keeps it up she won’t be seeing him. 

-kept up with the texting for updates and asking what I’m up to at home,  “there’s so much to do at home, are you keeping busy??” Things like that, as if growing a human isn’t already exhausting enough. 

-sending me daily Facebook videos that are mostly baby related. From advice type videos to literally anything baby related. I don’t even reply anymore. 

-repeatedly recommending me to do aquafit. Even after I politely told her I get exercise from daily walking. She kept insisting it’s better for the joints etc, even telling my husband I should try it. He told her to stop. 

That’s the jist of it. Hopefully I’m not overreacting. But she has been driving me nuts. I just want her to leave me alone. I’m dreading these next few weeks with my due date approaching. I should have never told her my due date. ",4,1729742037.0,Mildlynomil,0,0.83,False

My colorectal Dr suggested I take Sun fiber for chronic constipation which has good prebiotic properties. I also drink a coffee alternative that has prebiotic properties as well (chicory and dandelion root).

My question is, do I not have enough prebiotics in my gut to handle it? I’m adding some yogurt into my diet slowly to see if that helps and I’ve stopped the Sun fiber and coffee substitute in the mean time. I miss my coffee substitute so bad!

And I really would like to avoid renting a car. I'm down to train somewhere and use local pub trans or uber when I arrive. Any tips?? Thanks!",0,1729741478.0,hudsonvalley,0,0.25,False

The biggest problem is that my dog (a 6 year old pug) is extremely excited and anxious in any new environment. On top of that, every environment she’s in with people around her, she’s usually the star of the show. She’s just so stinking cute that people at dog parks, coffee shops, restaurants, and basically anywhere that allows dogs make a BIG DEAL of her.

And, at this point, she just expects the attention and it’s like if she’s not able to seek attention, she gets frustrated and whines and barks.

I didn’t think she was that bad, but she was disruptive to at least one other member of the team.

They’re all saying they “want to try to make it work” and they’re willing to let me bring her in on Fridays for a few weeks.

So what can I do to turn this one day a week into a routine that she picks up on quickly? How can I get her to settle in and be quiet? Is this gonna be a months long struggle?",1,1729741269.0,DogAdvice,0,1.0,False

i don't expect everyone to be as crazy about being punctual as i am, but it seems that 9 times out of ten, a date will text me about 30 mins before the actual real go-time that they're going to be late, for such and such reason. it didn't bother me the first couple times, because hey, stuff gets in the way, but it's been so consistent that it's starting to feel like maybe i'm missing something, or doing something wrong.

to clarify, i'm not talking about being five minutes late, because traffic was bad-- that barely shows up on my radar. i've had multiple dates *in a row* say they're going to be late, and have me sitting looking dumb in a coffee shop for a full hour, sometimes even two (i know it probably sounds sad to wait around for two hours, but i didn't know what else to do in that situation). is it me? or is this common in the dating scene? how do i stop this from happening to me in the future?

1gatd5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gatd5i/the_drain/,The Drain,"I had the dream again tonight. It seems to be coming more frequently now as we get closer to your arrival. Daddy says that it’s got to have something to do with the hormones or morning sickness. He’s always been practical that way and it’s one of the many reasons I love him and why he’ll be such a good father to you. When he looks at a problem he sees the edges of it, so clearly defined. But how do I tell a person like that the truth, how do I make him understand? 

I could tell him that right when I wake I can’t tell if I’ve truly left the dream. That I can feel the distorted images of my sleeping mind clinging to my skin like wet bandages. I could tell him that when I stumble through the predawn and fall to my knees before our toilet bowl that it’s not morning sickness which causes me to coat its porcelain interior but fear. Not a measured fear, not the fear of a practical person, but the panicky weightless fear of a small child. I could tell him that as I kneel on the cool tile floor I often sneak furtive glances across the bathroom and watch the empty pit where our sink would be in daylight and pray that I do not hear my name called out from within it.

I could tell him all of this and maybe he would believe me and maybe he would even know what to do. But none of that is the kind of thing you tell a practical person. That story has no clear edges.

So I close the toilet lid and lay my head against its cool surface and feel the nausea seep out of my core. I wait for clarity to reassert itself in my mind, the cobwebs of sleep dusting themselves into nothingness, and then I flush the toilet and make my way back to the bedroom. But as I leave the washroom I can’t help but notice that I lean subtly towards the outer wall, away from the vanity and our shared sink which it holds. 

Until the pregnancy I had always been one to sleep through the night but I find now that once fully awake, no matter the time, I’m up for the day. Still it’s too early to start my morning and, though it’s not as restful as sleep, returning to the bed does relieve some of the strain in my back. There’s a small added grace there too in that I get to spend time alone with you. 

I lay back in a half seated position, close my eyes and lay my hands across the swell of my belly. I breathe slowly, rhythmically, and imagine that I can feel your heartbeat synchronizing with mine. 

I begin to talk to you, not out loud as I don’t want to wake Daddy but in my thoughts. I tell you about myself and about the world and everyone who is waiting so anxiously to meet you. I explain how you are now the size of a sweet potato and how we’ll be going to the doctor today to check in on you. I imagine your future and all the amazing things you will accomplish. I make sure you understand that all I want of you is to be happy and healthy and caring. And then sometimes, very rarely but with a growing frequency, I hear you reply. You call to me from within myself and images flash across the vista of my mind which I swear are not of my own creation. It is in these moments that I feel nearest to you. 

I know that what I am experiencing isn’t reality but neither is it a dream. I can’t go back to sleep once awake but our little talks set me at such ease I enter a sort of trance state, half dreaming half waking, such that I don’t notice the morning light as it creeps across our bedroom and when daddy wakes and kisses you through my belly I come to in a start.

“Oh shit I’m sorry Liz I didn’t mean to scare you,” he says pulling back from my torso. “Are you okay hun, did you get enough sleep?”

I nod and smile. Daddy smiles back but as he slides off the bed and moves towards the ensuite I notice his eyes flit back to my face. The look is searching and concerned.

The lack of sleep, the pains, the general rigor of growing you within myself has all taken its toll on my body. I know it shows in the darkening rings under my eyes, in the lines that deepen on my face, and I know Daddy notices and I know he worries. I love him for that. But we both understand it will all be worth it in the end when we finally get to meet you. 

I try to relax and force the skin of my face to smooth. I stare ahead at the blank wall of our bedroom and listen as Daddy releases a stream of urine into the toilet bowl. He didn’t lift the lid but I won’t say anything this time, he has enough to worry about and worry is a cousin of anger. I don’t want to fight this morning, I don’t want to fight with you inside me. I don’t want to play out the events of the dream.

“So doctor today right babe?” Daddy calls from the bathroom. “It’s the twenty…one week checkup, yeah?”

Twenty two, it’s the twenty-second week. The thought materializes absently, mostly ignored by my working mind. I focus instead on the toilet flush and the sound of Daddy’s bare feet as they move across the tile floor towards the sink. I realize I’m holding my breath and think, bizarrely, how in that way I’m holding your breath too. Then daddy cries out.

“Ahh jesus!”

I watch my hands, laid protectively over you, as they break out in goose flesh. I know that I could ask him what’s wrong but what would be the point? This is all so repetitive, a recitation of the message relayed to me by dreams.

“Liz!” 

Daddy calls me and I refuse to answer. If I do not speak then we cannot progress, the end must remain as the end. I will not speak and in my silence I will not lose you.

“Oh Lizzie…you couldn’t make it to the toilet my darling?”

The words are wrong but that’s not what brings an end to my dissociation. It’s the care I hear in Daddy’s voice. When I near the end of the dream Daddy speaks to me, yes, but in roaring tones of anger and horror not kindness, never care. 

I rise from the bed and walk the short distance to the washroom. Daddy stands before the sink, I tell myself I will not look but as he moves his gaze downwards I follow, slowly, obediently. I steel myself for what awaits me.

But this is not the dream. The sink is empty, or nearly empty. A faint outline coats the porcelain, burnt yellow like the last of fall’s leaves and tendrilous - reaching from the drain in unmeasured jabbing spurts towards the rim of the sink. It’s a stain, a stain that so easily could have been the residue of my morning sickness. An explanation so simple, a connection so natural. And yet I know that when I vomited in the early hours I did so into the toilet. I’m certain of that.

Tears come then and Daddy holds me tightly. We are still pressed together when we feel you kick. Daddy beams at me and I force myself to smile back. This is a first for him, to actually feel your movement, and it sends him off on an excited tangent about what sports you will play. Only I know that this is not a rarity. Whenever I approach the sink I feel you reach out for it.

###

The sign on the outer door of the office reads Dr. Ahmad, printed in stark gray letters, but the middle aged woman who smiles as she applies gel to my distended belly has reminded me more than once to call her Amira.

Daddy has told me before that a friend from work swears by Dr. Ahmad, that she is the best obstetrician in the city and that he would settle for nothing less. I couldn’t say if that is all true but I do know that she always runs warm water over her hands before donning her latex gloves and touching my skin. I know that she hums prettily along to the radio as she maneuvers her wand along my torso and that this makes me feel at ease. I know she smells faintly of sandalwood.

“Lizzie?” Daddy is staring at me. “Did you hear what Dr. Ahmad said?”

“Oh no I’m sorry Dr. Ahm- I’m sorry Amira. Mommy brain. What were you saying?”

Amira smiles at me. Her eyes are kind, a warm brown color like strong coffee, eyes that have seen many mothers through this same journey. I think briefly how there is a sadness in that, I wonder if she regrets turning a miracle into mundanity. I wonder if she has carried children of her own.

“I was saying, Elizabeth, that in regards to your child I am very pleased with the results of today's tests. The ultrasound shows me that we are dealing with a healthy, well formed baby.” I open my mouth to vocalize relief but Amira cuts off my reply. “I am not, however, satisfied with your condition. Your stomach has grown along expected lines but you have lost weight elsewhere. I can see that you are under an unusual strain, it is clearly written in those dark bags under your eyes. It seems to me as though you are wasting away. This is not-“

“I’ve told her all this doctor,” I watch frustration flash across Amira’s face as Daddy interrupts her, “Well I did, didn’t I Liz?”

“This is not,” Amira continues, ignoring Daddy, “strictly indicative of a larger problem but it is concerning. Most concerning is that the cause of these symptoms is not of a medical nature. Now I know that it is not uncommon for first time mothers to focus so greatly on the health of the child they carry that they lose sight of the fact that their own health is paramount. You are one being, the baby takes its life from you. We must have you well rested and well fed. Can you think of anything that may be causing you undue stress?”

I see the drain, just a blip, flash across my mind. The thought is not my own, the picture appears unbidden. I feel you kick within me.

“No,” I lie, “There’s nothing that comes to mind.”

Amira watches my face. She looks from me to Daddy and back then nods and wheels her chair back to her desk. She picks up a stack of paper and returns to the bedside.

“Mr. Hamilton, would you kindly bring this to the nurse’s station? The sooner we file your wife’s results the sooner you can get her back to the comfort of your home and I would like to finish my assessment in the interim.”

I see in his hesitation that Daddy doesn’t understand, or doesn’t like, Amira’s request but we all know that he can’t argue against its logic. Without saying a word he takes the sheaf and exits the room. Amira watches Daddy go then picks up the phone from her desk and presses a button.

“Hello, yes, Anna I’m sending Mr. Hamilton out to you. I wonder if you could hold him at the desk for ten minutes or so? Yes, a possible code violet. Thank you Anna.” Placing the handset back in its cradle Amira turns back to me. “Elizabeth, will you please tell me what is troubling you? If your husband is the cause of your condition, if he is abusing you, then we must take steps to ensure your protection.”

The suggestion is so absurd I do not immediately respond. Amira waits, staring at me expectantly.

“No! Dr Ahma- I’m sorry, Amira,” I begin, “that couldn’t be further from the truth! Dan takes very good care of me and clearly you can’t see it but he’s just as concerned as you are. He has absolutely nothing to do with this. My problem is...the issue isn’t Dan. ”

“I didn't mean to make a hurtful accusation, Elizabeth. I simply need to examine all possible causes and I prefer to start with that which may be most harmful. So you do know what the problem is then?”

I have cornered myself. The image of carrying you to term within the padded walls of an asylum cell comes momentarily to mind. No, I trust Amira, I trust in her kindness. I don’t know if she will believe me, like Daddy she is a practical person, but I do believe she will not punish me for something so out of my control. And perhaps this is the help I’ve been so desperately seeking. I exhale and begin.

“Amira, do you believe that dreams may act as a kind of warning?”

“Hmm,” the doctor’s look is guarded but she continues, “I have read studies that broach the subject, yes. Something about our subconscious mind picking up data of which our conscious mind is unaware then regurgitating the information in the form of dreams. I can’t speak to the validity of the experiment but-”

“No, sorry, I mean do you think we can be given a glimpse of the future through our dreams?”

This step into the murky world of pseudo occultism draws only a tight lipped smile from the doctor. I continue undaunted.

“I’ve been having a recurring dream. I know it sounds ridiculous but I think…I think it’s a kind of portent of what’s to come.” Amira slowly nods at me to continue. “It always begins the same way. I wake up early in the morning, well before dawn, and I’m up because I’m experiencing terrible nausea. It’s worse than morning sickness, worse than food poisoning even, it feels like my insides are burning and my stomach is going to burst open at the belly button. I rush to the washroom then-”

“Is this taking place in your current home,” Amira clarifies, “as it is now?”

“Yes, exactly. Just as it is now. I have trouble distinguishing it from real life. There's none of the…looseness or randomness of dreams, it’s simply my bedroom, my life.”

“What happens then?”

“Then I stumble into the washroom and the pain is growing and growing. And I need to relieve it and I know that I have to go to the toilet to vomit but I stop myself at the vanity because…” 

Amira allows the silence to linger uncomfortably then prompts. “Because?”

How do I continue? Hearing the dream described for the first time in the light of day only exaggerates its absurdity. I lay my hands around you and tell myself that crazy or not, believed or disbelieved, I have to finish if only to ensure your safety.

“Because I hear my name. Called out. It’s quiet at first, a whisper so light I can’t even tell if it’s real. Something like…liiiiiissss. I search the bathroom for the source of the sound but there’s nothing. I'm completely alone. I become frantic, it's driving me crazy and almost in response the call gets louder and louder. Liz, Liz, LIZ, LIZ! I notice the echo then. The echoing wetness of the sound and it draws my attention to the sink and then I realize the thing is…is in there. Down in the pipes, down in that darkness, and it’s calling out to me.  At this point each repetition of my name blends together until it’s all one undistinguishable buzzing resonance. A sound or a chant which rings through me like something fetid and ancient…older than religion older than music. And I can’t, I can’t control myself. The sound is in me. Moving me. So I climb atop the vanity and I…I feel the thing grasping with its cold wet tentacles. And it’s moving up my body and I realize it doesn’t want me at all. I’m just a vessel to it. And then it…it…”

“What does it do Liz?”

“It…takes the baby. It takes the baby out of me…and I…I thank it because then the pain is gone.”

Amira sits still staring at us for a very long time. In the throes of my retelling I began to focus on the middle distance but now, emotionally spent but focused once more on the woman in front of me, I am relieved to realize the kindness has never left her eyes. She shifts her gaze downwards to the point where my hands clasp protectively in front of you then returns them to meet my face.

“This is troubling, to put the situation mildly. Do I believe that this is a glimpse of the future revealed to you? No, of course not,” I feel foolish but Amira continues reassuringly, “but that doesn’t mean I will not help you Liz. Whatever the reason for its recurrence, or its questionable importance, the dream clearly has a negative effect on you. I am not a trained psychologist but I may be able to treat the physical maladies this dream has caused.”

Amira swivels back to her desk and retrieves a small paper pad and begins to scribble on it.

“I am writing you a prescription for a low grade valium derivative. This would not regularly be advisable in the treatment of a pregnant patient but in this case I believe special measures must be undertaken. Take one pill before you sleep and you should pass the night without dreams.” I reach for the prescription but before I can grasp it Amira pulls the paper away. “This is only a treatment of the symptom, not a cure. You must rest, you must eat, you must relax. Without extending into fields in which I am no expert your dream is obviously the creation of a scared strained mind and contains no truth. No truth other than this, you are your child's vessel and as such must maintain yourself to ensure the baby’s health.”

I can feel tears coming then but fight them back. I see emotion displayed in the doctor’s face as well though whether it is pity or fear I cannot tell. She hides herself too well.

“Thank you Amira. Thank you so so much I can’t tell you-”

Our conversation is cut short as the door to Amira’s small office slams open. Dan stands in the doorway fury plainly labeled in the expansive whites of his eyes, the bovine flair of his nostrils.

“How dare you!” He bellows as he crosses the room to step in between Amira and myself. “Your nurse…me an abusive husband!? Liz grab your things my darling, we are leaving and we are never coming back!”

“Mr. Hamilton I had to take all-”

“Save it! But you better believe I’ll be spreading word of this! I am going to flood your reviews lady. I’m telling everyone I know to stay well clear. I’m going to ruin you!” 

Daddy has bundled us up now and is quickly moving our small family unit out the door and into the hall. He saves whatever parting barb he had in mind, employing instead his most thunderous scowl. I try to catch a final glimpse of Amira before I cross the threshold, to make her see how sorry I am, but all I can make out is the gray streaks in her dark hair floating above Daddy’s shoulder like seagrass in the moonlight.

###

I am not afraid, I tell my reflection in the mirror, the dream is a dream. Nothing more.

I stand before the vanity of our ensuite and cautiously lower my hands to its marble surface. The counter is cold but reassuringly solid under my weight. This is reality, this is normalcy. The small green pill stares back at me from beside the sink, unblinking as a malevolent eye. 

I lower my head to the sink basin and hover my ear above the drain. I restrain the urge to scream into the hole and wait. Nothing. Of course there is nothing, for a week now there has been nothing. No dreams, no nausea, no voices in the drain. All as it should be and all thanks to Dr. Amira’s tablets. 

I’ve started gaining back weight and the dark circles under my eyes have begun to clear. Sleep is a black void but it lasts the night through and I feel at least partially rested when I wake. There is one negative side effect however. I no longer hear from you. We cannot convene in the early hours, my mind is my own, and I find myself speaking to you less and less. It is sad but your safety is the priority. Still I miss our connection. I lift my belly up towards the drain but the only reaction it elicits is a gurgle in my stomach. You have gone quiet.

“Hun you coming to bed?” Daddy asks from the outer room, “could you turn the light off when you come over?”

“Of course, just a sec.” I respond as I take the pill and dry swallow it with a grimace.

The medication is hidden from Daddy in my makeup bag, though I’m not sure he would care even if he knew. After his outburst at Dr. Amira’s office he has become reluctant to involve himself with anything pregnancy related. Don’t think for a second this means he loves you any less, he’s only embarrassed. Daddy just needs time to lick his wounds.

As I enter the bedroom and turn off the overhead light I can feel the first hints of the pill working its way through my system. My eyelids begin to lag and my thoughts become muddled. Daddy speaks to me and I mumble a response, the words forgotten as soon as they leave my lips. I lie my head on the pillow and feel the black rush of unconsciousness descend upon me like a wave. I am asleep before Daddy has turned off his bedside lamp.

The pain is not what wakes me nor the chill which has crept across my uncovered skin. It is the faint sense of movement which pulls me from the darkness.The incremental sliding of hardwood floor against my skin. 

My initial response is one of confusion. Questions flood my mind; Where am I? Where is Dan? Why am I on the floor?

The thoughts come sluggishly and I realize with stupid slowness that the drug must still be cavorting through my system. Panic begins to rise from my stomach but I fight it back. I cannot let fear seize me before I understand what is happening.

I ask my eyes to open but the command is only half acknowledged, my left eyelid parts sluggishly while the right stays pressed against the floor.  All I can make out from my half open eye is wood grain moving by in uneven lurches and the moonlight which plays along the baseboards. I attempt to lift my head but only succeed in pressing out a groaning mumble which sounds as if it were spoken by another’s mouth. I cannot call for Dan. My groans are nowhere near loud enough to wake him. I am alone. 

It is then that pain cuts through the pill induced fog and rings out loud and true. What the drug had hidden from me till now is a sharp repeated two pronged jab which tears against the interior lining of my womb. I want to scream but the gummy bloating of my vocal chords prevents me. Instead I focus on the sensation and allow it to drive the last of the confusion from my mind. The truth this clarity brings makes me wish I could return to the oblivion of medically induced sleep forever.

I realize then that the pain inside my body is associated directly with my slow movement across the floor. With each stab my flesh is pressed against the hardwood and dragged backwards propelling the entire unit inch by excruciating inch forward.

Limited control is returning to my body now and with difficulty I am able to push my head upwards in the direction of my unintended destination. The black mouth of our bathroom doorway yawns before me. 

The dream is a dream.

I see now. I can feel the minute variations in pressure against my organs, the tickling points of internal contact that hide beneath the pain. 

It’s you. I feel your hands as they push against me from within, your feet as they kick against my ribs. You have always yearned for the drain or perhaps the thing that lives within the drain has always yearned for you. But now Amira’s work has blocked your progress. The pill disabled your vessel, made communion impossible so you took the matter up yourself as best you could.

My stomach flips and saliva fills my mouth. I allow it. The contents of my stomach spill across the floor and whether a placebic or truly cleansing act I feel fine motor control begin to spread throughout my body. I am finally able to halt your progress by turning onto my back just as we breach the doorway to the bathroom. The effort leaves me soaked in sweat and pain radiates from my torso. I close my eyes against the waves of agony.

A faint glow spreads across my eyelids, a sickly green which speaks of forgotten things long shunned from the natural light of day. I feel rather than hear the shuddering vibrations of the drain pipe as your unknowable friend makes its way upwards towards us. You are still, the pain ends abruptly, you know the time is at hand.

I scramble backwards away from the vanity pushing my back up against the far wall, my eyes closed all the time. Low moans escape from me but the echoing scream I truly desire to create seems momentarily to elude me. Instinctively my hands come down to protect you but the wriggling ambulations I feel there send another wave of nausea through me and I pull my hands away as if scalded. The green light grows brighter and I shield my face against it. Where it touches my skin it seems to leave a greasy residue. 

The sound of the thing is all around us now, it’s scratching grasping appendages snaking out over the tile of the bathroom. I breathe in its odor, a musk of rotting forgotten things long since washed or flushed away into the blind madness of its subterranean sewer world. I recoil as the first cold tentacle brushes along my bare foot. I feel you inside me shuddering wildly at the things touch, reaching back towards it. In that moment, given the proper tool, I would have cut you out myself.

Then I hear the voice, quiet at first but steadily growing as its purchase in our world solidifies. Solidifies within you.

Lissssssssss.

I scream then.

I scream until the sound dies within me. Then I am left humming tunelessly, swaying beside the toilet. This is where Daddy will find me. Daddy who sees such straight lines, Daddy who will ignore the unknowable and instead focus on nursing me so carefully back to health. Daddy who will help me through the last few painful months of your delivery. 

Daddy who I know is no longer your daddy.

1gatcl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1gatcl1/yall_disgust_me_as_christians/,Yall disgust me as christians.,"To preface, before every single one of you jump down my throat ""oh you're just another magat, you just worship your orange man like Jesus"" I do not like Trump, while there is some things he's done I agree with I think he's a shitty person and should not be looked at as a moral example. Now onto the point.

The vast majority of the redditors on here who claim to be ""Christian"" have twisted God's word to they're own comfort and benefit that it's impossible to call it Christianity anymore.

We have the ""Christians"" on the hard right, who may as well be modern day pharisees, who take it upon themselves to condemn people to hell while playing like they don't sin themselves.

We have the ""christians"" on the hard left, who want to reduce Christianity down to ""love your neighbor and that means being ok with whatever they do besides have differing opinions and Jesus said don't judge""

While I agree it is impossible to stay out of politics as a Christian, yall have let politics consume you and remove you from Christianity.

Yes Jesus said don't Judge for you to shall be judged, but he was talking about judging as a pharisees, sitting on a high horse and acting like you do not sin yourself. Calling out sin as sin is not ""judging and not loving your neighbor"". Christ calls us to have a spirit of discernment and root out evil where it is.

Yes The bible is pretty clear on LGBT issues despite what many of yall want to believe, that does not mean they are any less sons and daughters of God and deserving of Love than the rest of us, no I'm not going to say it's ok but im Lord knows I ain't perfect, I'm probably a much worse sinner than most of yall

For those coming with the ""God made me who I am, he wouldn't make an inherent part of me sinful"" THATS THE WHOLE POINT, EVERY PART OF YOU  EVERY PART OF ME, EVERY PART OF EVERYONE IS SINFUL. We are wholly decriped as a human race and need forgiveness and God's love for everything.

On the other hand, Casting out your sons and daughters because they are LGBT is wholly unchristian and anyone who does so should be ashamed

Abortion: lets go touchy subject

A lot of yall will point to Numbers 5 as ""Abortion instructions"" and therefore the bible says it's ok, first off what they were describing is a PUNISHMENT for unfaithful wives, not a step by step guide, and that it was decided by God (not us) if it takes place. On the other hand, there are SEVERAL verses proposizing the lide at conception argument

Psalm 139:13
""For you formed my inward parts; you covered me in my mother's womb"" 
 
Jeremiah 1:4-5
""Then the word of the Lord came to me saying 'Before you were born I knew you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations'"" 
 
Judges 13:7
""The boy will be a Nazirite of God from the womb until the day of his death"" 
 
Isaiah 49:1
""Before I was born the LORD called me; from my mother's womb he has spoken my name"" 

So now we have a clearer idea on where the bible stands on it, I'm sure I'll get the argument ""well it's none of your business what another person does"" Yes if it was how they take their coffee in the morning. By that same logic if they killed their infant child because they didn't want to raise them should I be ok with it? Being a Christian does not mean having no moral backbone in case you offend others, in fact it's quite the opposite. As for the arguments ""what if the mother will die during childbirth, what about sexual assualt"" Very few people are arguing against that extremely extremely sad but extremely small percentage of abortions, and those who are need help in the head, but the exception does not justify the rule. ""What if they aren't financially stable or mature enough to raise a baby"" So we should just kill it then?

On the other hand I firmly believe the solution is not just ""Abortion bad no more abortion"" this is a multi MULTI faceted issue. First off the foster care and adoption system in the US needs to be massively overhauled and upgraded, we need to incentivize 2 parent households again and not single mother's with no help, we need to create a culture of strong and faithful men again, not the womanizing douchebags we have right now, and I'm sorry we need to instill the fact that if you aren't comfortable having a baby with someone, you probably shouldn't be sleeping with them.

Now dont think I'm not coming for the right now too, the fact that you demonize these poor mothers who made this terrible choice is awful. I personally know a friend of mine who had one and it almost drove her to suicide. They were and are in an almost impossible situation and were steered to make that decision because they were taught it's the easy way out. Again going back to the pharisees comparison, yall are just as bad in so many ways. The fact you try to ban the few sad times it is needed is downright evil. 

The vast majority of people on this sub like to treat the bible as confirmation bias for their beliefs and twist it to the point it's not even Christianity. I'm by no means saying I'm perfect but yall are so full of yourselves yall to anyone who disagrees with you a false Christian yet refuse to look at yourselves.

I do not expect this post to get a positive response, infant I expe t quite the opposite, but if even one person is able to learn from this it'll be worth it.",3,1729740489.0,Christianity,37,0.57,False

Please tell me I made the right decision.,"Not new to coffee, but new to manual grinders. I have a Eureka Filtro that I love and a Mazzer Mini with Super Jolly burrs that I use pretty much only for the one or two espresso shots I make a month. Ha. It was something I got in a trade so, yeah I have it. 
Anyway. I'm moving across country with my gf and am going to be living out of a camper for about a month where space and electricity are kind of a premium, not to mention the fact that we'll be in some very pristine nature and an electric grinder isn't really the vibe. So I did a bunch of research and was about to pull the trigger on either the Kingrinder K6 or the Timemore S3, but figured I'd see what was on Marketplace first. Low and behold there was a barely used Comandante c40 MK4 near me with all the original accessories and even the box for $160. So I decided, fuck it, and bought the grinder. 
Thing is, I was a little trepidatious to spend $100 on a grinder and now I've spent $160! But also I've grown accustomed to a certain consistency when it comes to grounds and I don't really wanna give that up for the month and the future travels in the camper. 

Sooo and Tl;dr, I spent more than I was expecting on a manual grinder and need the coffee community to help me justify this purchase to myself.

1gat7v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowDoIStartABlog/comments/1gat7v0/how_to_blog_for_an_audience/,How to Blog for an Audience,"Hey everyone! I've been blogging for over 5 years and grown my audience from 0 to 100k monthly readers. Here's everything I've learned about writing content that actually gets read and shared.

------

## Understanding Search Intent (The Most Important Thing)

The biggest mistake new bloggers make is writing whatever they feel like. Success comes from writing what people are actively searching for. Here's how to nail search intent:

1. Use Google's ""People Also Ask"" feature to see what questions people have
2. Look at the current top 10 results for your target keyword
3. Analyze the content format (how-to, list post, comparison, etc.)
4. Note the depth of coverage and key subtopics
5. Create content that matches this search intent but does it better

Remember: If someone searches ""how to make bread,"" they want a recipe with steps, not your life story about learning to bake from grandma.

------

## Content Structure That Keeps Readers Engaged

Your blog posts need a clear structure that makes information easy to find:

* Strong intro that states what they'll learn
* Clear headings and subheadings (H2, H3, H4)
* Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
* Bulleted lists for scannable content
* Bold important points
* Relevant images every 200-300 words
* Conclusion that summarizes key takeaways

Pro tip: Write your outline first. It forces you to organize your thoughts and makes writing way faster.

------

## The Art of Headlines That Actually Work

Your headline needs to do three things:
1. Match search intent
2. Promise clear value
3. Create curiosity

Good examples:
* ""How to Write Blog Posts That Rank #1 on Google (Step-by-Step Guide)""
* ""17 Blog Writing Tips I Used to Get 1 Million Monthly Readers""
* ""Blog Writing for Beginners: Everything You Need to Know in 2024""

Bad examples:
* ""My Thoughts on Blogging""
* ""Blog Writing Guide""
* ""How I Learned to Blog""

------

## Writing Style That Converts

Write like you're explaining something to a friend over coffee:

* Use ""you"" and ""your"" frequently
* Share personal experiences as examples
* Include specific numbers and data
* Add expert quotes for credibility
* Use analogies to explain complex topics
* Keep sentences simple and direct
* Avoid jargon unless necessary

Remember: Most people read at an 8th-grade level. Write accordingly.

------

## SEO Basics That Matter

You don't need to be an SEO expert, but you should:

1. Use your target keyword in:
   * Title
   * First paragraph
   * At least one H2
   * Meta description
   * Image alt text

2. Include related keywords naturally
3. Write comprehensive content (1,500+ words for most topics)
4. Use internal links to your other relevant posts
5. Create descriptive URLs (example.com/how-to-write-blog-posts)

------

## Content Types That Perform Best

Based on my analytics, these post types get the most traffic:

1. How-to guides (40% of traffic)
2. List posts (25%)
3. Case studies (15%)
4. Comparison posts (10%)
5. Expert roundups (10%)

Focus on creating ""evergreen"" content that stays relevant for years.

------

## Promotion Strategy That Works

Content doesn't promote itself. Here's what actually works:

1. Build an email list from day one
2. Share on relevant subreddits (follow rules!)
3. Answer related questions on Quora (link when relevant)
4. Join Facebook groups in your niche
5. Reach out to people you mentioned for shares
6. Update old posts regularly

Don't waste time on:
* Spam commenting
* Low-quality guest posts
* Buying followers
* Content farms

------

## Tools That Make Blogging Easier

These save me hours every week:

* Ahrefs/SEMrush for keyword research
* Grammarly for proofreading
* Hemingway App for readability
* Canva for images
* Google Analytics for tracking
* ConvertKit for email marketing

------

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Learn from my failures:

1. Writing for yourself instead of your audience
2. Publishing inconsistently
3. Not building an email list early
4. Ignoring SEO basics
5. Writing too many short posts
6. Not updating old content
7. Focusing on social media instead of search

------

## Final Thoughts

Success in blogging comes down to three things:
1. Understanding what your audience wants
2. Creating better content than what exists
3. Being consistent for the long haul

Don't expect overnight success. It took me 6 months to hit 1,000 monthly readers, 12 months to hit 10,000, and 2 years to hit 100,000. But if you follow these principles and stay consistent, you will grow your audience.

Remember: Every successful blogger started with 0 readers. Focus on helping people solve their problems, and the audience will come.",1,1729740041.0,HowDoIStartABlog,0,1.0,False

What’s wrong with me? ,"I’ve always been attracted to men. Recently, though, I've developed a minor crush on my female boss. She's married with two adult children in their mid-twenties. While I'm Thai and she's blonde, her personality is incredibly appealing to me. She treats me with great respect, and I admire her professionally. I always speak very kindly about her to everyone in the company. 

I've always maintained a professional distance, keeping our conversations strictly about work and family. Outside of work, I've never texted her or asked her to do anything personal.

When I work on projects with her, I feel a boost in my mood. I've noticed that she chews gum, combs her hair, and applies lip gloss when I'm around. Perhaps she always does these things, but it's noticeable to me. We always laugh and enjoy our conversations, which are primarily work-related.
Each time I come by her cubicle, she is always happy to see me and seems to be able to put whatever she is working on aside to talk to me. Which was very kind of her. She knew I’m an excellent employee so she always finds way to promote me. 

My relationship with my parents is excellent. I come from a loving family. Since developing feelings for my boss, I’m shameful to admit that I look at porn featuring middle-aged women and imagining her. I would never want to have an intimate relationship with her and I don’t think I desire to do it but I've had sexual thoughts about her. Even when I'm intimate with my husband (who is a good lover), I sometimes think about her. I do however enjoy having a cup of coffee and grabbing dinner with her. I constantly seek her attention at work and I tried to stop that thought. What is going on with me? ",0,1729740029.0,dating_advice,18,0.5,False

1-) General Exam Mindset

2-) Predictive Exam Mindset

3-) Agile Exam Mindset



# 1-) General Exam Mindset



1. When answering Exam questions, always assume the information you need to answer the question is included in the question.



1. There will often be two or more possible answers: Prioritize the answers from **best/most** likely to worst/least likely based on the information provided.



1. Avoid extreme actions in your answers, such as closing a project, escalating to the Sponsor or other external party, not helping the customer, or answers that say you **""Must""**, or **""Only""**.



1. Aim for answers that have **inclusiveness** and **collaboration**, or an action by the Project manager. Be direct and collaborative in your approach.



1. As Project Managers, we don't have all the answers, but we have to be able to get the answers. So always consult the project team on solutions, estimating the work, when something should be done etc - they have the answers.



1.  The project Customer is the best person to judge / validate the deliverables and quality adherence (whoever is receiving the value - could be sponsor, owner).



1. Your decision on approach to any conflict should always benefit the outcome of the project and the value you are delivering, not individuals.



1. use inclusive tools, collaborative tools, and simple tools.



1. Remember Estimating techniques: Bottom Up will be more time consuming, top-down (often Analogous) will be less accurate and less time consuming.



1. Figure out what framework you are in: Predictive\\Waterfall, Adaptive\\Agile, Incremental, Iterative or Hybrid, then answer accordingly.

Sometimes it says it explicitly, other times you have to guess (it might include keywords such as Iterations or Sprints, Product Owner, Retrospective, Sprint Planning, User Story etc, or Change Request, Project Plans, Logs etc).

# 2-) Predictive Exam Mindset



1. Always create a plan, and don't deviate from that plan without a Change Request.

	Change Process is outlined in your Change Management Plan.

* Any stakeholder can raise a Change,
* Note the change in the change log,
* Asses its impact to all other Project variables: Cost, Schedule, Risk, Quality, Stakeholders etc,
* Take the change to approvers or the Change Control Board,
* Advise stakeholders of outcome,
* Note the outcome in the change log.



1. Risk might happen in the future, an Issue has already happened.Use your Risk Register and Issue Log for each.Risk can be Opportunities (positive) or Threats (negative).

1. Identify as much risk as you can, as early as you can. The cost of risk increases as it gets closer to Project close.

1. Always consult your team on solutions, using their Expert Judgement.

1. Know the closing process - and use it even when closing the project early.

* Confirm formal acceptance,
* Finalize any open claims,
* Ensure transition to operations,
* Measure product benefits
* Final lessons learned,
* Formally releases resources,
* Finalize and close any accounts,
* The Final Report provides a summary of the project performance, and whether the objectives were met.
* Archive project information for future use, into Organization Process Assets.

1. Lessons learned are updated throughout the project.

1. Know your stakeholders communication preferences. Always ask - What they need, how and when. Don't assume.

1. Engage stakeholders early and often. Review and update them throughout the project.



# 3-) Agile Exam Mindset



1. Be the Servant Leader - remove blockers for the team, shield them from diversions, and help them grow.

1. Find out what motivates your team, to help them improve and grow.

1. Coach the Product Owner if they need it, but they must prioritize the Product Backlog, not us.

1. Communicate the vision to the team often.

1. Always co-locate the team if you can.

1. Always face-to-face communication.

1. Allow a lot of wall space - visual management for the team's ""Information Radiator"".

1. Ensure a safe space for disagreements - psychological safety - ensure everyone has a voice.

1. Use the Kanban board to show the work, see constraints, and limit work in progress.

1. Review the way of working and any issues in a Retrospective.

1. Review any product items completed by seeing the actual product in a demonstration, not a report.

No medications; I take multivitamins, fiber supplements, and fish oil

Pre-diabetic, but otherwise clean comprehensive blood panel as of late June.

I've lost almost 60lbs in about 18 months. I was eating at a pretty consistent caloric deficit, but without paying enough attention to actual nutrition. I'm trying to correct that now, but I can't figure out why the left side of my face keeps twitching (eye and upper cheek).

I remember noticing the twitching getting worse around May. But it can stay for a day and then quiet the next. I can't really figure out any rhythm to it. 

At first, I thought too much coffee. I've cut that down to just one day a week. I work out 3-4 days a week, so I thought maybe electrolytes. I salt my morning water and try to have a sports drink after a workout, but it twitched a lot today even though I haven't worked out in four days. I've been getting better with my sleeping habits too, as I thought that may have been a factor. Even when I'm slept up, it twitches (like today). Even Googling stuff like calcium deficiency can have that symptom, and I was eating hardly any dairy, so I have cheese sticks with breakfast regularly. Even when I work more potassium (bananas and spinach) into my diet, I've noticed the twitching.

I can't figure out what causes it to start or stop. Where would you look next? Could it have anything to do with blood sugar? I have doc appointments scheduled but after New Years.

Sweet treat if wanted: two dates with butter and HU choc chips 

I should mention that butter has NEVER bothered me even with being lactose intolerant. So, my question is the past few days I’ve had terrible lower back pain, and stomach cramping and BAD bloating. I dont know what the heck is going on because I see people losing weight like crazy and feeling amazing but I feel like I am having reverse effects. And my stool has been almost like baby blowout type stool😂 sorry TMI. 
I dont know what’s going on and some insight would be super helpful. I also should mention that I do have 1-2 cheat meals a week usually on the weekends because I’m doing this more 80/20 because I still want to live life a little. Even though it is more 90/10. 

Please let me know if you have any thoughts!

I’ve been lurking on this sub daily since we started planning a year ago and am happy to say we finally made it to the other side. This is probably going to get long, but here’s my recap of how our day went. 

We had a 50 person wedding in downtown Savannah, GA for about 15k and it truly was the most beautiful day. The weather was absolutely perfect, all the vendors did amazing. We were surrounded by our best friends and families and felt so much love throughout the whole day.

We had an outdoor ceremony in a historic garden and in true Savannah fashion, rented a trolley for transporting everyone from the ceremony venue to the reception venue which was located in a private event room of an upscale restaurant. 

Everything went according to plan except for the one thing I was worried about going wrong which was the reception music as we did not hire a DJ. We bought a decent quality Bluetooth speaker and connected it to my iPad. We opted to have a friend MC and created a playlist through Spotify for cocktail hour music and dinner which was easy enough using the crossfade feature in Spotify but we also edited our entrance and first dance music using Audacity so we would not have to play full songs for the parents and wedding party to walk in to and so my partner and I wouldn’t have to dance to an entire 4 min long song. The Spotify playlists were fine, but when our MC played the music file for our reception entrance it didn’t play properly and we all basically walked in to music skipping and then my partner and I standing awkwardly for it to finally finish (which felt like forever but was really only like 30 seconds) for the entrance song to transition to our first dance, which thankfully didn’t skip. In hindsight it was just a blip and nothing that could have dampened our day and truly for it to be the only thing that went wrong, how can I complain? We had our dance music created through a freelance DJ on Fiverr which was suggested by someone else on Reddit and the dance mix was a hit! It was my first time using Fiverr but 100% recommend it if you’re not hiring a DJ and are stressing about the dance music like I was. We had plenty of guests grooving all night and the Fiverr DJ did an excellent job of mixing our music and putting a DJ spin on it, it was almost like he was actually there playing it! 

Like what a lot of others have said, the day FLEW by considering how much time and effort we put into planning it all. I wish I had a remote and could rewind time and replay parts that I loved the most, like getting ready with my bridesmaids which originally was planned to be taking shots and getting loose before the ceremony, but turned into just coffee and bagels and reminiscing on good times, laughing and enjoying each others company since I partied a little too hard the night before. The morning of I was actually EXTREMELY hungover and was still trying to crawl out of bed when hair and makeup arrived at 11am. Thank goodness for my bridesmaids who brought liquid IVs and bagels as I was so worried I had ruined my whole day by getting too drunk the night before.

I wish I could also replay our vows which we wrote ourselves and I cried like a baby, both reading mine and listening to my partners. We hadn’t heard each others vows until the moment we were reciting them to each other and there were 3-4 things we both said that were exactly the same and I couldn’t help but feel so validated in that moment that I was marrying the exact person I was meant to be marrying. 

It was the best day full of so much love and we are both so happy with how everything went. We truly could not have done it without our wedding planner who made miracles happen for us in terms of vendors and just generally being there for us every step of the way through every decision and bump in the road. We can’t thank her enough! Our photographer was also so lovely and made us both feel so comfortable. We did receive a preview of some pictures and they are STUNNING and we are so anxious to see the full gallery in a few weeks. 

Anyways if you made it this far, thanks for reading and happy planning to those in the thick of it! Don’t stress out, it will all work out no matter what happens because at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is marrying your person and celebrating your love together. ❤️🥹",4,1729739500.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False

Yesterday at 3am my gut was telling me to go through his texts and I found conversations with this girl he works that went on everyday (often at night) for the past 7 months. He called her baby/babe, beautiful, asked to make romantic gestures like take her out to coffee and walk around the park, and invited her to a concert (Mt. Joy which is romantically significant to our relationship). There was nothing inherently sexual in the conversations but I did see that they were meeting up for beers a LOT. Either when I was at work or during times that he told me he was at his grandma’s house. To me this is emotionally cheating at best and I sort of do believe him that nothing physical happened (am I being stupid for that?). He swears it was just a flirty friendship. 

Also for context, a year ago we moved across the country from my hometown to be here and take care of his sick grandma. Times have been hard and my mental heath has hit all time lows, but we were happy in our relationship. Literally best friends and soul mates. I love him so much and I don’t know if it’s necessary that I have to break up with him because cheating is cheating, or if this is something I could get past. 

Also also context, he told this girl that we were broken up and I was just living at his house, yeah that one stung while I’m cooking and cleaning and trying my best for him and his family. 

I’ve been in a lot of emotional pain since I found out and cant think straight. Any input is appreciated, thank you. ",1,1729739417.0,AmIOverreacting,7,1.0,False
1gat16d,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1gat16d/update_on_bb/,Update on BB ,"Ok, long story short I was cured for a while last year. Then it slowly came back. I made a post on what worked (please look it up, it's a long post). I wouldn't say I'm cured, however it's managed and under control as long as I am careful. One way to tell if your breath is off, try this. I never noticed until I got better. After your brush your teeth, drink a flavored drink, not coffee. Red Bull or tea are noticable for me. If my breath is off and I take a sip of Red Bull after brushing, it'll taste eggy. Then I know my breath is off cuz I can taste it, but that goes away after a while. If you take that first sip and it tastes ""clean"", your breath is good. (Should be). 

What helps? :
1. Switch toothbrush regularly, makes a huge difference
2. Brush your whole mouth well and for a long time. ""Trace"" your gum line thoroughly,this is very important step. 
3. Toothpaste matters. Use Colgate fresh mint stripe, Arm and Hammer therabreath, and Periobiotic toothpaste from Amazon. 
4. Colysys mouthwash is by far the most effective for me. Supposedly it only kills bad bacteria. 
5. Brush your tongue with tung brush and tung gel. 
6. Extra virgin coconut oil pulling. But consume a tbl spoon before pulling, it clean your throat. Swallow slowly.
7. Floss daily, and use waterpik ($28 on Amazon). Mix distilled water, with capful of Colysys mouthwash. 
8. Take Spirulina and chlorella powder mix daily with water.
9. Use oral probiotics (not long term) and intermittently. I like to alternate them every other day. Prodentis brand (doesn't have BLIS M18 OR K12) but for some reason they are super effective. I also use Oralprobio that do contain the two strains mentioned. Pop one in the morning after brushing and one at night after brushing. 
10. One of it not the most important, watch your sugar and carbs intake. Breads, cakes, potatoes (any form) make my breath worse.
11. Start consuming Greek yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, and drink kombucha. If I get lazy for a while, BB is starts back up. 
12. Brush more than once a day, preferably after every meal and especially before bed. 
13. Drink hella water, stay hydrated.
14. I have fatty liver, but this still works!!  

My breath as of right now is good!! I haven't had a reaction in a month or more now. Stay consistent!! Sometimes it takes months to notice a difference, or it could take almost a year, but keep going, if it's bacteria related, this will work!! ",3,1729739411.0,badbreath,0,1.0,False

That's been my weekend routine ever since I started using this robot vacuum. After months of testing it on everything from pet hair to crumbs on the kitchen floor, I’m ready to tell you how it stacks up.

**My Experience**

When I first got the Roborock Q7 Max+, I wasn’t sure how well it would handle my busy household. With two kids and a dog, keeping the floors clean feels like a never-ending battle. But this vacuum has been a game-changer. I set it up through the 2.4G WiFi connection, which was quick and stable, and now it runs on a schedule every day.

The first thing I noticed was how well it adapts to different surfaces. My living room has thick carpet, while the kitchen and hallway are hardwood, and the Roborock doesn’t miss a beat. It automatically cranks up the suction on the carpet, leaving it looking freshly cleaned. Here’s what else stood out:

**What Makes It Stand Out**

* **Powerful 4200Pa Suction**: This robot vacuum packs some serious power. I’ve tested it on everything from dog hair to scattered cereal, and it picks up everything with ease. The suction automatically increases when it detects carpets, which means I don’t have to worry about leftover debris hiding in the fibers.
* **2.5L Auto-Empty Dock**: I’m the kind of person who forgets to empty vacuum bins, so this feature is a lifesaver. The auto-empty dock can store debris for up to seven weeks. I’ve gone over a month without even thinking about it, and it’s still not full. It’s one less thing to worry about in my already busy routine.
* **Vacuums and Mops Simultaneously**: It’s not just a vacuum—it’s a mop too. The dual function is amazing for those days when the dog tracks in mud or spills happen. With 30 adjustable water flow levels, I can choose just the right amount of water for different floor types. Plus, the combined dustbin and water tank make it easy to manage everything in one go without constant refilling.
* **PreciSense LiDAR Navigation**: This tech is impressive. The Roborock Q7 Max+ maps my home with pinpoint accuracy. It’s avoided every chair leg and never gotten stuck under the couch. I can even set no-go zones through the app, like around the dog’s water bowl.
* **Upgraded All-Rubber Brush**: I’ve dealt with too many vacuums where the brush gets tangled with pet hair, but the rubber design on this one resists that. I haven’t had to untangle the brush once, which is a relief with a dog that sheds like crazy.
* **180 Minutes of Runtime**: The battery life is another plus. It can run for up to three hours, meaning it covers my entire house in one go. Even on days when the kids and the dog have made extra messes, the Roborock Q7 Max+ handles it all without needing a recharge.

All-in-all, if you’re tired of spending your weekends cleaning or constantly emptying your vacuum, the Roborock Q7 Max+ is a fantastic investment. Its powerful suction, auto-empty feature, and ability to vacuum and mop at the same time make it an all-in-one cleaning solution. Just set it and forget it—your floors will be spotless. The only thing to keep in mind is the initial setup of the app, but once it’s running, this robot vacuum is truly a set-it-and-forget-it solution for busy homes.",1,1729739110.0,TheRobotVacuums,0,1.0,False
1gasvyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1gasvyk/the_drain/,The Drain,"I had the dream again tonight. It seems to be coming more frequently now as we get closer to your arrival. Daddy says that it’s got to have something to do with the hormones or morning sickness. He’s always been practical that way and it’s one of the many reasons I love him and why he’ll be such a good father to you. When he looks at a problem he sees the edges of it, so clearly defined. But how do I tell a person like that the truth, how do I make him understand? 

I could tell him that right when I wake I can’t tell if I’ve truly left the dream. That I can feel the distorted images of my sleeping mind clinging to my skin like wet bandages. I could tell him that when I stumble through the predawn and fall to my knees before our toilet bowl that it’s not morning sickness which causes me to coat its porcelain interior but fear. Not a measured fear, not the fear of a practical person, but the panicky weightless fear of a small child. I could tell him that as I kneel on the cool tile floor I often sneak furtive glances across the bathroom and watch the empty pit where our sink would be in daylight and pray that I do not hear my name called out from within it.

I could tell him all of this and maybe he would believe me and maybe he would even know what to do. But none of that is the kind of thing you tell a practical person. That story has no clear edges.

So I close the toilet lid and lay my head against its cool surface and feel the nausea seep out of my core. I wait for clarity to reassert itself in my mind, the cobwebs of sleep dusting themselves into nothingness, and then I flush the toilet and make my way back to the bedroom. But as I leave the washroom I can’t help but notice that I lean subtly towards the outer wall, away from the vanity and our shared sink which it holds. 

Until the pregnancy I had always been one to sleep through the night but I find now that once fully awake, no matter the time, I’m up for the day. Still it’s too early to start my morning and, though it’s not as restful as sleep, returning to the bed does relieve some of the strain in my back. There’s a small added grace there too in that I get to spend time alone with you. 

I lay back in a half seated position, close my eyes and lay my hands across the swell of my belly. I breathe slowly, rhythmically, and imagine that I can feel your heartbeat synchronizing with mine. 

I begin to talk to you, not out loud as I don’t want to wake Daddy but in my thoughts. I tell you about myself and about the world and everyone who is waiting so anxiously to meet you. I explain how you are now the size of a sweet potato and how we’ll be going to the doctor today to check in on you. I imagine your future and all the amazing things you will accomplish. I make sure you understand that all I want of you is to be happy and healthy and caring. And then sometimes, very rarely but with a growing frequency, I hear you reply. You call to me from within myself and images flash across the vista of my mind which I swear are not of my own creation. It is in these moments that I feel nearest to you. 

I know that what I am experiencing isn’t reality but neither is it a dream. I can’t go back to sleep once awake but our little talks set me at such ease I enter a sort of trance state, half dreaming half waking, such that I don’t notice the morning light as it creeps across our bedroom and when daddy wakes and kisses you through my belly I come to in a start.

“Oh shit I’m sorry Liz I didn’t mean to scare you,” he says pulling back from my torso. “Are you okay hun, did you get enough sleep?”

I nod and smile. Daddy smiles back but as he slides off the bed and moves towards the ensuite I notice his eyes flit back to my face. The look is searching and concerned.

The lack of sleep, the pains, the general rigor of growing you within myself has all taken its toll on my body. I know it shows in the darkening rings under my eyes, in the lines that deepen on my face, and I know Daddy notices and I know he worries. I love him for that. But we both understand it will all be worth it in the end when we finally get to meet you. 

I try to relax and force the skin of my face to smooth. I stare ahead at the blank wall of our bedroom and listen as Daddy releases a stream of urine into the toilet bowl. He didn’t lift the lid but I won’t say anything this time, he has enough to worry about and worry is a cousin of anger. I don’t want to fight this morning, I don’t want to fight with you inside me. I don’t want to play out the events of the dream.

“So doctor today right babe?” Daddy calls from the bathroom. “It’s the twenty…one week checkup, yeah?”

Twenty two, it’s the twenty-second week. The thought materializes absently, mostly ignored by my working mind. I focus instead on the toilet flush and the sound of Daddy’s bare feet as they move across the tile floor towards the sink. I realize I’m holding my breath and think, bizarrely, how in that way I’m holding your breath too. Then daddy cries out.

“Ahh jesus!”

I watch my hands, laid protectively over you, as they break out in goose flesh. I know that I could ask him what’s wrong but what would be the point? This is all so repetitive, a recitation of the message relayed to me by dreams.

“Liz!” 

Daddy calls me and I refuse to answer. If I do not speak then we cannot progress, the end must remain as the end. I will not speak and in my silence I will not lose you.

“Oh Lizzie…you couldn’t make it to the toilet my darling?”

The words are wrong but that’s not what brings an end to my dissociation. It’s the care I hear in Daddy’s voice. When I near the end of the dream Daddy speaks to me, yes, but in roaring tones of anger and horror not kindness, never care. 

I rise from the bed and walk the short distance to the washroom. Daddy stands before the sink, I tell myself I will not look but as he moves his gaze downwards I follow, slowly, obediently. I steel myself for what awaits me.

But this is not the dream. The sink is empty, or nearly empty. A faint outline coats the porcelain, burnt yellow like the last of fall’s leaves and tendrilous - reaching from the drain in unmeasured jabbing spurts towards the rim of the sink. It’s a stain, a stain that so easily could have been the residue of my morning sickness. An explanation so simple, a connection so natural. And yet I know that when I vomited in the early hours I did so into the toilet. I’m certain of that.

Tears come then and Daddy holds me tightly. We are still pressed together when we feel you kick. Daddy beams at me and I force myself to smile back. This is a first for him, to actually feel your movement, and it sends him off on an excited tangent about what sports you will play. Only I know that this is not a rarity. Whenever I approach the sink I feel you reach out for it.

###

The sign on the outer door of the office reads Dr. Ahmad, printed in stark gray letters, but the middle aged woman who smiles as she applies gel to my distended belly has reminded me more than once to call her Amira.

Daddy has told me before that a friend from work swears by Dr. Ahmad, that she is the best obstetrician in the city and that he would settle for nothing less. I couldn’t say if that is all true but I do know that she always runs warm water over her hands before donning her latex gloves and touching my skin. I know that she hums prettily along to the radio as she maneuvers her wand along my torso and that this makes me feel at ease. I know she smells faintly of sandalwood.

“Lizzie?” Daddy is staring at me. “Did you hear what Dr. Ahmad said?”

“Oh no I’m sorry Dr. Ahm- I’m sorry Amira. Mommy brain. What were you saying?”

Amira smiles at me. Her eyes are kind, a warm brown color like strong coffee, eyes that have seen many mothers through this same journey. I think briefly how there is a sadness in that, I wonder if she regrets turning a miracle into mundanity. I wonder if she has carried children of her own.

“I was saying, Elizabeth, that in regards to your child I am very pleased with the results of today's tests. The ultrasound shows me that we are dealing with a healthy, well formed baby.” I open my mouth to vocalize relief but Amira cuts off my reply. “I am not, however, satisfied with your condition. Your stomach has grown along expected lines but you have lost weight elsewhere. I can see that you are under an unusual strain, it is clearly written in those dark bags under your eyes. It seems to me as though you are wasting away. This is not-“

“I’ve told her all this doctor,” I watch frustration flash across Amira’s face as Daddy interrupts her, “Well I did, didn’t I Liz?”

“This is not,” Amira continues, ignoring Daddy, “strictly indicative of a larger problem but it is concerning. Most concerning is that the cause of these symptoms is not of a medical nature. Now I know that it is not uncommon for first time mothers to focus so greatly on the health of the child they carry that they lose sight of the fact that their own health is paramount. You are one being, the baby takes its life from you. We must have you well rested and well fed. Can you think of anything that may be causing you undue stress?”

I see the drain, just a blip, flash across my mind. The thought is not my own, the picture appears unbidden. I feel you kick within me.

“No,” I lie, “There’s nothing that comes to mind.”

Amira watches my face. She looks from me to Daddy and back then nods and wheels her chair back to her desk. She picks up a stack of paper and returns to the bedside.

“Mr. Hamilton, would you kindly bring this to the nurse’s station? The sooner we file your wife’s results the sooner you can get her back to the comfort of your home and I would like to finish my assessment in the interim.”

I see in his hesitation that Daddy doesn’t understand, or doesn’t like, Amira’s request but we all know that he can’t argue against its logic. Without saying a word he takes the sheaf and exits the room. Amira watches Daddy go then picks up the phone from her desk and presses a button.

“Hello, yes, Anna I’m sending Mr. Hamilton out to you. I wonder if you could hold him at the desk for ten minutes or so? Yes, a possible code violet. Thank you Anna.” Placing the handset back in its cradle Amira turns back to me. “Elizabeth, will you please tell me what is troubling you? If your husband is the cause of your condition, if he is abusing you, then we must take steps to ensure your protection.”

The suggestion is so absurd I do not immediately respond. Amira waits, staring at me expectantly.

“No! Dr Ahma- I’m sorry, Amira,” I begin, “that couldn’t be further from the truth! Dan takes very good care of me and clearly you can’t see it but he’s just as concerned as you are. He has absolutely nothing to do with this. My problem is...the issue isn’t Dan. ”

“I didn't mean to make a hurtful accusation, Elizabeth. I simply need to examine all possible causes and I prefer to start with that which may be most harmful. So you do know what the problem is then?”

I have cornered myself. The image of carrying you to term within the padded walls of an asylum cell comes momentarily to mind. No, I trust Amira, I trust in her kindness. I don’t know if she will believe me, like Daddy she is a practical person, but I do believe she will not punish me for something so out of my control. And perhaps this is the help I’ve been so desperately seeking. I exhale and begin.

“Amira, do you believe that dreams may act as a kind of warning?”

“Hmm,” the doctor’s look is guarded but she continues, “I have read studies that broach the subject, yes. Something about our subconscious mind picking up data of which our conscious mind is unaware then regurgitating the information in the form of dreams. I can’t speak to the validity of the experiment but-”

“No, sorry, I mean do you think we can be given a glimpse of the future through our dreams?”

This step into the murky world of pseudo occultism draws only a tight lipped smile from the doctor. I continue undaunted.

“I’ve been having a recurring dream. I know it sounds ridiculous but I think…I think it’s a kind of portent of what’s to come.” Amira slowly nods at me to continue. “It always begins the same way. I wake up early in the morning, well before dawn, and I’m up because I’m experiencing terrible nausea. It’s worse than morning sickness, worse than food poisoning even, it feels like my insides are burning and my stomach is going to burst open at the belly button. I rush to the washroom then-”

“Is this taking place in your current home,” Amira clarifies, “as it is now?”

“Yes, exactly. Just as it is now. I have trouble distinguishing it from real life. There's none of the…looseness or randomness of dreams, it’s simply my bedroom, my life.”

“What happens then?”

“Then I stumble into the washroom and the pain is growing and growing. And I need to relieve it and I know that I have to go to the toilet to vomit but I stop myself at the vanity because…” 

Amira allows the silence to linger uncomfortably then prompts. “Because?”

How do I continue? Hearing the dream described for the first time in the light of day only exaggerates its absurdity. I lay my hands around you and tell myself that crazy or not, believed or disbelieved, I have to finish if only to ensure your safety.

“Because I hear my name. Called out. It’s quiet at first, a whisper so light I can’t even tell if it’s real. Something like…liiiiiissss. I search the bathroom for the source of the sound but there’s nothing. I'm completely alone. I become frantic, it's driving me crazy and almost in response the call gets louder and louder. Liz, Liz, LIZ, LIZ! I notice the echo then. The echoing wetness of the sound and it draws my attention to the sink and then I realize the thing is…is in there. Down in the pipes, down in that darkness, and it’s calling out to me.  At this point each repetition of my name blends together until it’s all one undistinguishable buzzing resonance. A sound or a chant which rings through me like something fetid and ancient…older than religion older than music. And I can’t, I can’t control myself. The sound is in me. Moving me. So I climb atop the vanity and I…I feel the thing grasping with its cold wet tentacles. And it’s moving up my body and I realize it doesn’t want me at all. I’m just a vessel to it. And then it…it…”

“What does it do Liz?”

“It…takes the baby. It takes the baby out of me…and I…I thank it because then the pain is gone.”

Amira sits still staring at us for a very long time. In the throes of my retelling I began to focus on the middle distance but now, emotionally spent but focused once more on the woman in front of me, I am relieved to realize the kindness has never left her eyes. She shifts her gaze downwards to the point where my hands clasp protectively in front of you then returns them to meet my face.

“This is troubling, to put the situation mildly. Do I believe that this is a glimpse of the future revealed to you? No, of course not,” I feel foolish but Amira continues reassuringly, “but that doesn’t mean I will not help you Liz. Whatever the reason for its recurrence, or its questionable importance, the dream clearly has a negative effect on you. I am not a trained psychologist but I may be able to treat the physical maladies this dream has caused.”

Amira swivels back to her desk and retrieves a small paper pad and begins to scribble on it.

“I am writing you a prescription for a low grade valium derivative. This would not regularly be advisable in the treatment of a pregnant patient but in this case I believe special measures must be undertaken. Take one pill before you sleep and you should pass the night without dreams.” I reach for the prescription but before I can grasp it Amira pulls the paper away. “This is only a treatment of the symptom, not a cure. You must rest, you must eat, you must relax. Without extending into fields in which I am no expert your dream is obviously the creation of a scared strained mind and contains no truth. No truth other than this, you are your child's vessel and as such must maintain yourself to ensure the baby’s health.”

I can feel tears coming then but fight them back. I see emotion displayed in the doctor’s face as well though whether it is pity or fear I cannot tell. She hides herself too well.

“Thank you Amira. Thank you so so much I can’t tell you-”

Our conversation is cut short as the door to Amira’s small office slams open. Dan stands in the doorway fury plainly labeled in the expansive whites of his eyes, the bovine flair of his nostrils.

“How dare you!” He bellows as he crosses the room to step in between Amira and myself. “Your nurse…me an abusive husband!? Liz grab your things my darling, we are leaving and we are never coming back!”

“Mr. Hamilton I had to take all-”

“Save it! But you better believe I’ll be spreading word of this! I am going to flood your reviews lady. I’m telling everyone I know to stay well clear. I’m going to ruin you!” 

Daddy has bundled us up now and is quickly moving our small family unit out the door and into the hall. He saves whatever parting barb he had in mind, employing instead his most thunderous scowl. I try to catch a final glimpse of Amira before I cross the threshold, to make her see how sorry I am, but all I can make out is the gray streaks in her dark hair floating above Daddy’s shoulder like seagrass in the moonlight.

###

I am not afraid, I tell my reflection in the mirror, the dream is a dream. Nothing more.

I stand before the vanity of our ensuite and cautiously lower my hands to its marble surface. The counter is cold but reassuringly solid under my weight. This is reality, this is normalcy. The small green pill stares back at me from beside the sink, unblinking as a malevolent eye. 

I lower my head to the sink basin and hover my ear above the drain. I restrain the urge to scream into the hole and wait. Nothing. Of course there is nothing, for a week now there has been nothing. No dreams, no nausea, no voices in the drain. All as it should be and all thanks to Dr. Amira’s tablets. 

I’ve started gaining back weight and the dark circles under my eyes have begun to clear. Sleep is a black void but it lasts the night through and I feel at least partially rested when I wake. There is one negative side effect however. I no longer hear from you. We cannot convene in the early hours, my mind is my own, and I find myself speaking to you less and less. It is sad but your safety is the priority. Still I miss our connection. I lift my belly up towards the drain but the only reaction it elicits is a gurgle in my stomach. You have gone quiet.

“Hun you coming to bed?” Daddy asks from the outer room, “could you turn the light off when you come over?”

“Of course, just a sec.” I respond as I take the pill and dry swallow it with a grimace.

The medication is hidden from Daddy in my makeup bag, though I’m not sure he would care even if he knew. After his outburst at Dr. Amira’s office he has become reluctant to involve himself with anything pregnancy related. Don’t think for a second this means he loves you any less, he’s only embarrassed. Daddy just needs time to lick his wounds.

As I enter the bedroom and turn off the overhead light I can feel the first hints of the pill working its way through my system. My eyelids begin to lag and my thoughts become muddled. Daddy speaks to me and I mumble a response, the words forgotten as soon as they leave my lips. I lie my head on the pillow and feel the black rush of unconsciousness descend upon me like a wave. I am asleep before Daddy has turned off his bedside lamp.

The pain is not what wakes me nor the chill which has crept across my uncovered skin. It is the faint sense of movement which pulls me from the darkness.The incremental sliding of hardwood floor against my skin. 

My initial response is one of confusion. Questions flood my mind; Where am I? Where is Dan? Why am I on the floor?

The thoughts come sluggishly and I realize with stupid slowness that the drug must still be cavorting through my system. Panic begins to rise from my stomach but I fight it back. I cannot let fear seize me before I understand what is happening.

I ask my eyes to open but the command is only half acknowledged, my left eyelid parts sluggishly while the right stays pressed against the floor.  All I can make out from my half open eye is wood grain moving by in uneven lurches and the moonlight which plays along the baseboards. I attempt to lift my head but only succeed in pressing out a groaning mumble which sounds as if it were spoken by another’s mouth. I cannot call for Dan. My groans are nowhere near loud enough to wake him. I am alone. 

It is then that pain cuts through the pill induced fog and rings out loud and true. What the drug had hidden from me till now is a sharp repeated two pronged jab which tears against the interior lining of my womb. I want to scream but the gummy bloating of my vocal chords prevents me. Instead I focus on the sensation and allow it to drive the last of the confusion from my mind. The truth this clarity brings makes me wish I could return to the oblivion of medically induced sleep forever.

I realize then that the pain inside my body is associated directly with my slow movement across the floor. With each stab my flesh is pressed against the hardwood and dragged backwards propelling the entire unit inch by excruciating inch forward.

Limited control is returning to my body now and with difficulty I am able to push my head upwards in the direction of my unintended destination. The black mouth of our bathroom doorway yawns before me. 

The dream is a dream.

I see now. I can feel the minute variations in pressure against my organs, the tickling points of internal contact that hide beneath the pain. 

It’s you. I feel your hands as they push against me from within, your feet as they kick against my ribs. You have always yearned for the drain or perhaps the thing that lives within the drain has always yearned for you. But now Amira’s work has blocked your progress. The pill disabled your vessel, made communion impossible so you took the matter up yourself as best you could.

My stomach flips and saliva fills my mouth. I allow it. The contents of my stomach spill across the floor and whether a placebic or truly cleansing act I feel fine motor control begin to spread throughout my body. I am finally able to halt your progress by turning onto my back just as we breach the doorway to the bathroom. The effort leaves me soaked in sweat and pain radiates from my torso. I close my eyes against the waves of agony.

A faint glow spreads across my eyelids, a sickly green which speaks of forgotten things long shunned from the natural light of day. I feel rather than hear the shuddering vibrations of the drain pipe as your unknowable friend makes its way upwards towards us. You are still, the pain ends abruptly, you know the time is at hand.

I scramble backwards away from the vanity pushing my back up against the far wall, my eyes closed all the time. Low moans escape from me but the echoing scream I truly desire to create seems momentarily to elude me. Instinctively my hands come down to protect you but the wriggling ambulations I feel there send another wave of nausea through me and I pull my hands away as if scalded. The green light grows brighter and I shield my face against it. Where it touches my skin it seems to leave a greasy residue. 

The sound of the thing is all around us now, it’s scratching grasping appendages snaking out over the tile of the bathroom. I breathe in its odor, a musk of rotting forgotten things long since washed or flushed away into the blind madness of its subterranean sewer world. I recoil as the first cold tentacle brushes along my bare foot. I feel you inside me shuddering wildly at the things touch, reaching back towards it. In that moment, given the proper tool, I would have cut you out myself.

Then I hear the voice, quiet at first but steadily growing as its purchase in our world solidifies. Solidifies within you.

Lissssssssss.

I scream then.

I scream until the sound dies within me. Then I am left humming tunelessly, swaying beside the toilet. This is where Daddy will find me. Daddy who sees such straight lines, Daddy who will ignore the unknowable and instead focus on nursing me so carefully back to health. Daddy who will help me through the last few painful months of your delivery. 

Daddy who I know is no longer your daddy.

Doing more informal and casual activities? ,"[The New Rulebook for First Dates: Sweatpants, No Makeup](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-rulebook-for-first-dates-sweatpants-no-makeup-11635542692)

Cut the bul$hit and actually try to see early on if this is a guy you would love to build a life with?

I've also read about extending the concept to going on more informal coffee dates, active dates outside, and fun casual activities. The bottom line is to be comfortable. I wear little to no makeup anyway.  I mean, if he asks me to an orchestra, I’m going to be appropriately dressed, but whenever and wherever possible stick with activewear and steer towards more authentic or character revealing activities.

Key sections from the article (as it is paywall):

>Why spend hundreds of dollars and precious time to dress up and get your hair and makeup done, just to slug wine during dates (some of which she termed “hellish”) with random fellas from Bumble? Plus, were they even seeing the real Amy? And so she “cracked the code” as she puts it, by coming to dates in athleisure, applying minimal makeup and minimal effort. 

>For a first meeting with a match, she advises clients to come straight from a workout (or the couch), barefaced and without artifice. She calls it a “mini screener date”: 30 to 45 minutes for coffee or an early drink.

>New York City recruiter Julie Samuel, 32,  used to dress up in heels and nice jeans for fancy-drinks dates. But then last year she consulted with Ms. Nobile, who told her, “You’re not meeting people who want to get to know you—they’re getting to know this perfect version of you.” Ms. Samuel took the advice to dress down and immediately saw its wisdom. She said it helped her “weed people out faster” by breaking down any walls and getting to know them in their normal state. She didn’t dress up for her current partner until four months after they began dating, when they attended a wedding together. She remembers, “I turned to him and said, ‘This is totally the opposite of every other relationship I’ve been in. The first time you’re seeing me dressed up is when you already love me.’” Ms. Samuel mused that the “Love, Amy” approach was focused on “values.”

I focused on grad school and my career. I was open to relationships, but didn’t actively seek them for lack of time and opportunity unless I really thought there could be compatibility. A majority of my field are women which doesn’t help. I have tried to ask two different guys out in an informal, plausibly deniable way, but it didn't work. They did clearly get the memo, but they were each already with someone. I am such a go getter and girlboss, but just so much more shy when it comes to guys. Those micro convos took me over a week to plan bc I didn't want to damage my standing in the environments in which I met them (fitness class, office party).

I am really more introverted I guess, but I want do the things that as a young professional with more time and money than grad school, I now can. Like the article says, I find going out, dressing up, and slugging wine are hellish. I don’t really even drink. Bars are boring and boorish. Local alumni groups seem like the adult version of sorority parties. I’m planning to do things I actually enjoy, like a running club. I do group fitness but it isn't at all conducive to this. The local professional society is majority women and not an appropriate way to find guys. I like hiking, but there aren’t really many groups where I’m at. Meetup for that just kind of scares me I guess. Churches both that I actually agree with and have any young professional social life are a long commute. So I think I’m almost certainly going to end up resigned to primarily online dating like the article indicates, as terrible as I know that is supposed to be. I want to be able to treat finding my guy like my second job because of course it’s that dedication which got me my grad degrees and my real job. If only there was a textbook, ""The Technical Processes for Finding a Husband."" Alas I know love doesn’t really work this way, which is somewhat scary.

I love the idea of this article, but might struggle a lot with the confidence to pull it off knowing it goes against the grain. I’m in my early 30s and feel like time is really ticking as I want kids. My parents are getting older and I want to be settled before I have the emotional labor of caring for them (financially they're okay). Most of my friends who didn’t do lengthy grad school are married, many with kids. My chances of finding an unmarried guy I actually want to date in the wild seem infinitesimal or at least super super time cost prohibitive - all the time investment to those groups with a very limited unmarried pool in this age bracket in those groups and getting smaller by the year.

Why did the dye color change after adding the wool?,"I cold mordanted with alum powder for 4.5 hours with non superwash wool. I added it to my red onion skin dye. Before I put it in, it was much redder. The paper towel on the left was dipped before adding the yarn. The paper towel on the right was dipped after. The yarn is turning out a lovely coffee color, but I'm surprised at the radical difference!

1gase4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1gase4j/10_years_of_loss/,10 Years of loss,"My story started when I was 16 in 2013, and that year, two of my best High School friends passed away. One by a car accident, and then a close friend of mine committed suicide in grief concerning our friend dying, leaving in his Instagram bio for the rest of time to read, ""I'll see you one day, buddy""

Before my friend passed away, we went on a summer vacation with friends to another friend's house to stay over a weekend. We got in a huge fight, and we had a major falling out. I didn't talk to him before he died. 

The last time I saw my best friend, who I had homeroom class with every day, was at my friend's funeral. 

Then, before that, he was expelled from school for becoming behaviorally reckless and bringing a bottle of alcohol to school to drink through the day. Right before he was caught and arrested at school. He saw me in his last class of homeroom, where he tried to get me to take the bottle from him ""because they were onto him."" 

I said no because I didn't want to get in trouble myself. I could've easily taken that bottle and stashed it or trashed it somewhere from my book bag, and he would've possibly never gotten caught with it. He was acting a fool, and his breath reeked. I still second-guess this. 

\-

When I turned 17 in 2014, my Senior year of High School. A girl met me, and it was love at first sight. The week I met her, I experienced what the Doctor at the Hospital called a ""First break, prodromal psychosis"". 

During my first ""episode,"" I experienced my first Command Hallucination phrases from auditory hallucinations and delusions. 

In my new homeroom class, after being transferred from my friend passing away. Meeting all new people that year after - I met this girl over the weekend at a school soccer game. She was very shy the last time we met. She approached me without saying a word, outlined my stenciled ""Stussy"" shirt, and asked what it meant. She was very coy, didn't say a word to me, blushed, smiled like a child, and ran off laughing like a kid. 

The people I sat with were talking about meeting her at a party over the same weekend that I met her at a soccer game. 

They were talking about taking advantage of her and trying to get her drunk so they could ""Bring her to the back room and hook up with her."" I jumped out of my skin emotionally and lashed out verbally. Attempting to fight one of my classmates, 

These were the group and type of kids that my group and type of people hated morally, and we rivaled. One of my other best friends, and best friends with my now-dead friend. Kicked in this guy's car door because they came by his house to punk on him. The same guy, the owner of the house party, and his girlfriend cheated on him with me at age 15 because she said she hated him. We were considered ""Rat or trashy"" by this other ""In-group,"" and she was just meeting these people for the first time that night. I was attempting to protect her from these awful people, and that's simply what I was trying to do: save my love for her and me. 

Also the same guy that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out with years later making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend saying that he should be dead. 

I continued in my psychosis that day. Remembering, thinking I was a highly intuitive psychic time-traveler.

For some reason or the other. I had the rationale of believing that the girl that I met was endangered by these people after this incident that day in her classes, and I became concerned. Becoming so delusional that I left one of my classes to search for her in random classrooms. 

I landed on a teacher who told me in the past, a year before after my friend's death. ""If I ever had an emergency, you can come to my classroom. I can take all the students out of the class. I can help you."" So this happened, and we called my parents. My parents were on the way from work to pick me up because I started to become concerned for my mental health. They were going to take me to the hospital. - During this encounter, the school police were involved and began questioning me when in the room after the call. I started to become paranoid, thinking I was under arrest and going to jail. I started to become delusional and verbally violent with the officer in disrespect without reason. The police officer ran at me, tackled me onto the floor, and arrested me. 

I screamed for my life Bloody Mary, and every single surrounding classroom heard me. Students came to the door, trying to get into it to save me. 

I got expelled from school for ""Fighting a police officer"" and resisting arrest, when never under any crime committed to arrest me. Only able to come back on medical waiver from the hospital, and on thin ice. 

\-

When I arrived at the hospital, my first grandiose delusion was the Shutter Island theme. I fought with the nurses on admittance and became hostile because I was delusional and thought they were lying to my parents to separate me from them. 

They held me down in an 8-point procedure and briefly held a plastic bag to prevent me from spitting on them. They injected Ativan into my IV, and my vision faded from colored vision to black, like turning off an old-school television. 

\-

Coming back to High School a week later, experienced the daydream nightmare of the immaturity of teens in High Schools. like me, Dorthy of bullying, dealing with hazing, two-faced liars intentionally stigmatizing and creating mis-socialization-ally drama to misinform others about my false identity reputation. Marginalizing my life without chance or opportunity to show worthiness or growth. Stunting my whole lifeline, 

Also, the day terror of sitting in front of all the people had just experienced everything that happened the week before during class; like it didn't happen. 

Whipped cream on top was going to a soccer game the next weekend. To watch the girl that fell in love with me at first sight. Walking up to her while she was sitting alone in the stands, attempting to sit around near her to start a conversation about what happened so I could explain it. She stood up and ran off without a word right as I sat down and said, ""Hey,""

The cherry on top was during my psychosis. I had the delusion that one of my friends at the lunch table across from me during my episode was texting this girl, I grabbed his phone out of his hand. He said ""She's not in my contacts,"" I scrolled down his list, and found her in his phone book. I got her # out of it, and - then started to text her over the next month. 

She started to reply, and I would text her every morning before school - like my dead best friend had taught me to do with girls. To wake them up with a smile every day, ... So I would text her ""Good morning"" and even do it normally without a reply. At one point after this, I asked her if she liked me, and she said, ""Yes."" 

Over time, after this. I don't remember what happened because she just randomly stopped replying out of the blue one day. I still haven't talked to her in person, a whole conversation. Just a simple, Hello, Goodbye. 

\-

After graduating High School in 2015, we followed each other on Instagram for 2 years. I got the Follwers+ app, and it showed my insights, her being my #1 liked on all photos. 

I had not yet said anything about my Hospitalization up to this point and kept my experiences to myself with my trauma. Going to therapy and trying to resolve it. Unsuccessful, grieving the reality that would come if I became vulnerable to her when telling her the truth of my visit. 

I saw her from time to time when I would go out and get something to eat. One time, when she was working at a Hostess job, she waved at me, and I put my head down in my hat and walked past her through the door. I saw her at a friend of friends, a foreign exchange student party. I guarded her in basketball and made her laugh, bouncing goofy on a trampoline. I saw her at two graduation parties, and we played volleyball together on a team. We also had an exclusive night, where all my old High School friends played soccer 5-5, where she showed up. I picked her to be on my team in line up, as captain. Also scored on her nutmeg, while the goalie ran around with my shirt over my head. Victorious, her guy friend we played soccer with that night was good friends with me and took her to prom, and told me ""She was happy to see me that night""

In this era of my life, I was delusional. Dropped out of school due to trauma and paranoia. To start selling marijuana by the pound, to escape my judgmental Hometown. I planned to run away to Europe and become homeless & nameless. Sleeping on Euro-Star trains nightly traversing the country's borderlines, moving around enough to never been seen. My wish. 

Robbed at gunpoint, during a deal that went South one night over 3/4 a pound of weed. 

\-

In 2016 moved on to a new girl, about a year after this. Meeting someone new online. She liked my photos on Instagram and was from my old High School. She followed me, and I DM'd her. We started to talk for a week,

Sympathizing toward her Dad's Stage 3-Terminal Lung Cancer, we began to bond over her struggle empowering her strength. 

My at-the-time best friend, from High School. Knew this girl, and when I told him I was talking to her - He looked at me like he had seen a ghost, and didn't say a word as the hair on my arms stood up in the deafening stare of silence. 

He said ""I shouldn't be talking to her,"" and wouldn't explain why. I thought it was because he was family friends, with their family. It didn't make sense to me at the time a very big head-scratcher. 

Over the next few days, I was messaging her still and she became less and less frequent in replies reply text emotions, and length. I thought she was depressed because of her Father, the last messages I remember sending her were ""You are strong""

The next day, after waking up and realizing I was out of the blue, blocked. I received a random text message from an old High School classmate I used to sell weed to. He had made up some whole elaborate scheme, of a lie of a story. Saying that him, and this girl that I was talking to - for a whole week. ""Had a boyfriend, and I'm her boyfriend. You need to stop talking to her, she doesn't want you talking to her. Me bothering her, and creeping on her."" 

This conversation delineated and descended into madness. I rivaled him, knowing this wasn't the truth. Having zero photos on her Instagram of him, or even mentioning him once during the week she contacted me. He ended up telling me to ""Go hang myself"", and I figured out it wasn't the truth. The last message I read from him, was before putting my phone down and started calling people for days to find out where he lived.

Even worse, after this. I decided to further my investigation, of what was going on with my reputation that I didn't know about wasn't my idea of my own life, but others' disrespectful perception. 

I took to Instagram, to air out the dirty laundry of the conversation between me and the guy that texted me. Losing 500 followers in 2 days. I messaged the best friend of the girl who had just blocked me. She was my older brothers, Ex-girlfriends' younger sister. I thought I could trust her enough, having conversations with her in the past. She told me that ""in 1-2 years, her best friend who blocked me would be coming out as lesbian, and that she was unsure about her sexual emotions towards men, and me"". She had said that she had liked me, but I was starting to pressure her into love, or romance because I thought she wanted a relationship messaging me. - I believed it, and this was a 2-year long lie. That I believed. 

\-

After this lie was told to me in 2017, I thought that we all were literally ""Best friends forever"" because she just told me her best friend's deepest, darkest secret that she'll be coming out within 1-2 years. 

This also led me into delusional thinking and thought that since now these girls were friends with me, she was a lesbian. I could move on to a new girl, or what I poorly decided to do looking back. I went back to the first girl - her being friends with these girls. That I thought I had a second chance, her being a lesbian. I had feelings for in High School that I met at the Soccer Game, that I had my episode over. 

This fooled me into delusional thinking that these people were my friends. Literally, 

I made a Twitter account. Because I thought I was popular, and started following all of these people that lied to me because I wanted to speak on the topic over social media, so I could follow my friends and clear the air, to get my reputation back. 

I followed and messaged the first girl that I met in High School at the soccer game - trying to rekindle our relationship. Thinking we were friends now, us all being in on the know-how. 

I started to Tweet, but this is when my first manic/depressive episode happened. Back when Twitter was 140 characters, I tweeted 500 tweets. Opening up about the Hospital, because I felt comfortable about my new ""friends"" accepting me, and I wanted my whole community to know about this story now. Us being friends and feeling wanted and belong. 

The girl from High School got a No-Contact, Restraining order against me. 

She didn't even read a single one of the Tweets I sent, and just saw her name mentioned and filed it. Because now this was technical-ly ""harassment and cyber-stalking"" 

\-

I still was fully under the delusional misinformed perception, that this other girl was fully a lesbian, and was coming out in College in 1-2 years. After he Father passed away, she had time to heal. Feel comfortable.  

I tried to express this story to my old friends, over social media. That had now ghosted me, unfollowed me, and blocked my number. 

I didn't know what was going on, I was in the dark for 2 years. No one, not a single person. No old ""friend"" decided to tell me anything about it - likely such a well-hidden secret targeting character assassination that all these other people my old friends hung out with. Lied to them. To rid me, 

I sat on Social Media over Twitter for 2 whole years, with 0 followers, tweeting my life and heart out away trying to make up for the past and be forgiven. Through reconciliation, and went to church weekly for the whole time. Thinking that Jesus had ""Blessed Me"" - Waiting 2 years for this girl to, never come out. To figure it was a lie. 

1 year of realization of this lie, and no friends later. I attempted a suicide mission, to talk to the girl from High School at the soccer game. On the address where it was put on the restraining order to stay away from. I wanted to die and prayed too.  

I got arrested after showing up to her College dormitory campus, of 40,000 people. Twice, two days in a row. Searching for her name on the dorm doors. I was going to knock on her door, and wished she was inside to speak to her. It was my dying wish almost looking back. 7 years ago this week, 

I went to Jail for 9 days, only. Thinking it would be more severe ""Stalking"" charges which, I literally Googled and researched before because that's what I wanted to catch, to keep myself in jail long enough to be killed by an inmate. 

My parents could've bailed me out on day two, but hung up on me over the phone in a screaming match while staring at inmates that wanted to kill me over my charges. 

I went to the Hospital for two weeks after this and was misdiagnosed as bipolar. 

\-

I went to therapy monthly, which was mandatory for my plea deal while on probation back in 2017-18. With the same therapist for one whole year. Talking about this story, and about how she was a ""Lesbian"" and I hung out with one friend in this entire timeline of my probation of two years. 

The night I hung out with my one friend from High School an old best friend, it was for 1 hour. His girlfriend at the time went to the College I showed up at. He harassed me deceptively in front of my face, to hang out with me to ""Figure out what's going on in my life"" my guess, and poked around making fun of my life, all while calling me a friend. 

At one point making up a game, and scenario, where we would ""Imagine our future life's;"" He started to get sinister, and said that ""I could see you being physically abusive towards your future wife, and just lightly slapping her around""... it got dark for no reason in particular. I didn't even say what I thought his life would be, or look like. I didn't get it, and couldn't believe he went all that way just to make it like that. In awe to this date, appalled, 

He got cancer 2 years later, and didn't let me visit him once while it was happening, 

My other best friend; the one that looked like he saw a ghost when I was talking to the new girl. I hung out with him one night after this incident, when after I got diagnosed. I talked to him, and we bro'd it out. Apologized, and agreed to disagree on the topic. He had changed drastically, and he and his girlfriend I knew from High School. Weren't even going to tell me they were planning on getting married together soon. I found out later after on Instagram, not hearing about it when we hung out together, and he didn't even tell me it was going to happen. Most likely didn't want me asking to come, or be invited, or even think of such ideas. 

I had received a \*67 Caller ID prank call, with a girl disguising her voice as a man. I heard snickering and laughter from boys and girls in the background. They had asked me ""Did you get laid by that one girl at the cul-de-sac party?"", Putting the idea later together in time ""The Block Party""   .... Up to this point in my life I haven't talked to a girl in 5 years. 

I started to make over-the-phone death threats, and then, over the internet on Social Media on Twitter, I had a mental breakdown where I name called and put death threats on my social media to people I thought had my number and were messing with me. 

The police were called, and I got in trouble by them filing a report! They interrogated me in front of my parents, and I told them what was going on with me. They believed me, but told me to not go about doing it that way, ... I was just triggered and exploded in rage. 

I kept up the Twitter, unknowing of the idea that she wasn't lesbian, or not being real. Trying to communicate with the first girl with the restraining order, to reconcile forgiveness. Attempting to persuade her to love me again, and negotiate out a deal between us to have happiness because it wasn't me, but my mental illness. 

Speaking to no one about it, and thinking that I shouldn't come out with her lesbian secret because he Father passed away from Lung Cancer now. I didn't aim to disrespect. 

I met an old High School friend I used to sell weed to at a gas station one night, ironically enough. His girlfriend at the time that was with him, was best friends with the girl that had the restraining order on me. He actually came up to me in line, behind me, and stuck out his hand to handshake, and say ""What's up"", like nothing happened. 

I messaged him on Snapchat, and he filled me in on a major truthful update. He said that the girl I thought was a lesbian; wasn't. The girl with the restraining order was getting a second one, and she was also ""Happier without me""

Coming shortly later to find a couple months later, on her newly created Facebook. She was dating the guy that was the host of the party back in High School, best friends with one of the guys that tried to take advantage of her in High School. The guy that his girlfriend in High School Freshman year cheated on me because she hated him. The guy that got his car door kicked in by my best friend, and my now dead best friend. Also, the same guy that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out with years later making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend saying that it's better that he's dead. Also found out she joined a sorority and started to become egotistically classy. 

She had also stated that I was ""Visionless, and controlling"" , I needed ""to be happy, to be in a relationship""

\- 

I became suicidal again in 2019, but was hospitalized after writing a suicide note and put on medicine shortly after dropping out of college for the third time due to being symptomatic from stress. 

I went to therapy for years after this, and after being discharged by my last therapist for ""inability to treat client, needs a higher level of treatment"" I bounced around from therapist to therapist. 

One time being called a stalker, and then by another an ""Incel"" 

My parents started to fight so much over the last years, with this idea and with me. Talking of divorce, and fighting screaming at each other in death matches with me.  My own Mother stated to me out loud once in a fight over this topic where she chose their side for years against me. ""I don't know who you are anymore!""

Getting in a fistfight with my Father where I knocked him out unconscious when he told me ""I'm glad I kept you in jail for longer and didn't bail you out""

My brother, abandoned me. Not talking to me for whole years. Disliking me If we already didn't get along before enough a verbal fight with him one night brought out the idea, and words that I was a ""Fuck up"" 

\-

In 2020, I had another hospitalization, this one being my fourth and fifth. 

I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective-Bipolar. Originally, just diagnosed bipolar but it was a misdiagnosis. Unmedicated improperly for 4 whole years. In and out of psychosis, delusions, hallucinations. Etc,. 

I had contacted the friend that met me at the gas station, that I used to sell weed to back in High School. He said that he can talk to her about it, and we talked back and forth for about a week. 

He said that she said that ""It had been so long since we met, and everything including us has changed. We weren't the same anymore, and that we didn't have the same alignment that we used to have growing up.

That sunk me like a rock to the bottom, and I was told that she was moving states. 8 hours away. 

4 years had passed on the restraining orders, and restraining orders only last 2 years til you have to decide if you need to refile. Or it become permanent if necessary. 

She didn't renew the restraining orders. When she had enough evidence to. 

Months later, I kept tallies of her Instagram over the years. Dreaming of being unblocked and happy together once again. I kept tallies on her friends Instagram's too, to check to see if she's in the photos; or if they leave me little coded messages like they used to back in the restraining order to communicate how they felt towards me with what I was saying.  

I found one day on her best friends instagram, saying ""You're not alone"", ""I set you free for freedom sake :)!, Never give up, there is always brighter days around the corner."" 

I deleted my instagram, in rage and realization of a reversal in loss of time. I took it more than personally. 

I was frustrated with life. 

\-

During the next two years 2021, & 2022,

I took medicine, looked around for jobs. Couldn't find therapy. One friend at the time, and he then suddenly passed away on his birthday night I took him to the bars to drink. 

He co-piloted me that night, and wing manned me because he knew about my story. I grew into being diagnosed with abandonment issues, trust issues, and avoidant personality disorder.  

I had met a girl, with him. He let us be, and I got her number that night. Took him home and talked all about it, smoked a blunt before he went inside for the last time. Talked about music, and how art needs to be relevant,. 

He left his lighter in my car that night on accident, and in the morning when I figured out he passed away. I found his lighter that reads ""Going Nowhere Fast""

He smoked about two packs a day, and worked 80+ weeks, he passed away from a widow maker heart attack. Age 25. Apparently had a undiagnosed murmur.  The military never spotted it in his service. 

I worked around at my Dad's janitors' office for $3,600 a year. Couldn't get any jobs anywhere; not even Walmart with my misdemeanor ""Invasion of privacy"" charges. I wouldn't even get calls back after two interviews, and companies would flat out ignore me like I was obsolete.  

I worked terrible, under the table jobs where I would make cash and often times manipulated out of money.

Quitting wear house jobs on the spot multiple times because I was unable to keep up with demands. 

\-

2023, & 

I was talking to a doctoral-level psychologist, who was also a therapist. She was a trauma care specialist, and she also specialized in intellectual disability to name a few. She is no longer my therapist. She had me sign up for an Autism Screening Test, which I never ended up taking. 

Before she dropped me as her patient.. she said after jail & the hospital ""I was trying to have a relationship with her"" 

?

In 2019 when I went to the psych ward at Methodist after a voluntary commitment for suicidal ideation, I got evaluated for a week for Autism. 

The same dual doctorate resident who told me that she thought I was on the spectrum sat me down, and told me she wanted to take me out of the ward after the week's evaluation and take me to ""meet the other people just like me, to get to know myself better"". I told her ""No, I don't want to go"" because I had been there for 3 weeks and it was a day before my birthday that I got discharged, and told. 

I had an unmedicated delusion. Where I stopped taking medicine from when I started in 2021-2023 after my diagnosis.

I bought that same first girl that forgave me, and had the restraining orders on me a Tiffany Charm Clasp Bracelet for $1,500 off my parents credit card, because I thought they were satanists, and wanted to make it up to her, and piss them off for messing up my life abusing me emotionally.  

I got into a delusional fight about thinking my parents were living a double-life as Free Masonic demonic worshipers. Which wasn't even close to the truth, just found an old Free Mason book on our book shelf from 2000, where my Dad attended a introductory meeting with his friend when he was trying to sell him insurance. 

  
I told my Father priest about this on the day of The Feast of Guardian Angels, and while my parents were out of town on vacation when I went into madness.

My priest gave me a holy water bottle blessed to smite Satan. With the book wrapped in a towel after touching it, reading 5 pages then, slamming it shut. An Angel appeared and took the book in the image. because I vacated my house thinking it was cursed terrified. He told me to douse the house with holy water to sleep & shower plus eat.

I got detained by my local police for disturbing the peace when getting into an argument with my parents, my Dad called the cops on me. At my house after they got home.

I was taken to the local hospital, by a police officer that heard out my story & gave me $100.

I took an Uber with the money he gave me after I got dropped off at the ER. Waiting for Secure Holding. The wait was 6 hours.

I went to my therapist's office in crisis and instead decided to go to the ER up there for me to try and get sleep medication because I hadn't rested in a week.

The medical staff at the hospital said they couldn't help me, or prescribe me any medicine. They instead diagnosed with me Anxiety Disorder and then discharged me from the ER at 4 am in 25 minutes. When it was 20 degrees outside, telling them I had nowhere to go; homeless. Other people were sleeping on the chairs in covers. (probably homeless too)

The Resource Security Officer started to threaten me. I started to argue with him, and I walked out.

For some reason -- My delusions, and hallucinations took hold of me spiritually. I was enraged by my self-evident situational outcome.

I filled up the Holy Water vial with water and marched up into the ER. Threw the water on the officer's face that kicked me out, and ran out. Getting away. Dropping my phone in the process,

I walked about a mile on the premises, into a building where I thought I was secure to catch my breath from running.

The police stormed in, and arrested me saying ""Hand's on Officer, Officer down"". Portraying that I assaulted the man physically with my body.

When I saw the Officer again he had red all over his face, I don't know what caused that. Maybe analgesic reaction

They took me to the County Jail, where I was put into Cell Block C, with accused charges to be arraigned of Felony Battery

I was met quickly with inmates checking me. I was punked being my size, and weight. Being in jail before, I knew this wouldn't be an easy trip.

Entering at exactly 7:07 am the Officer checked when held for 20 minutes at the gates, with my confirmation Saint Maximillion statue in my possession in my book bag that they detained me with.

I was getting out alive determined.

Not understanding that the complex only allowed one five minute call per inmate each week without pay. Having no money in my account, calling my parents to let them know, before being cut off unknowingly mid-conversation. 

A despot inmate, after me sneezing once from likely dust being in the facility; Accused me of having Covid, and started a fight that began with him charging at me to pull me off the 6ft top double bunk I was lying in.

I jumped off, scared from the drop. Him all in my personal space and area. Tried to chase him out of my bunk, to then be knocked out. I sprung back up, after hitting the back of my head on a metal bench seat.

An inmate behind me picked me up and led me back to my bed. Where I passed out for hours. 

Awoke in the middle of chaos, to have to defend myself from the guards never noticing on the camera.

The place was wild, with people smoking weed & spice in the showers. Passing lines of Coke through the neighboring cell block doors.

People coming in, and multiple jumping's were being witnessed. Where these killers left other inmates bathed in blood and tears from head to toe.

I hid amongst the Fear of God with the other prayer group of inmates reading Bible study in the block. With rife Hell Raising gang members telling me now ""Don't press charges against him"", thinking this was the only way out of the block.

Being told ""I was lucky because they stomped someone to death in this cell block here two weeks ago""

Now knowing from other inmates if I went into the medical or the suicide room. I could save myself.

Talking to one of the guards about in the morning to check back on the cameras, honestly trying to get out alive with my life.

Going to medical to be evaluated for my wounds after being forced by a gang leader to leave the block or else, after realizing staying in the block wasn't my best bet.

They transferred me and put me into cold isolation, given food with no utensils. No toilet paper, for half the day.

Officers came to my cell, after my claims in medical. Stated that I charged after him, and the person trying to hurt me wasn't trying to hurt me ""On their million-dollar camera system"", now me being the assailant when I never touched anyone. Knocked unconscious, apparently ""I was never knocked out"", since I got up so quickly.

Then they tried to mitigate the situation by trying to force me to sign papers saying that I wasn't going to press charges on him when I was now being arraigned on more different charges, going to trial now for two cases. In jail.

In the meantime, while waiting, arraigned by the magistrate. I got my other charges lowered to A & B misdemeanors with a $500 bond.

Being moved into another block after medical & isolation, waiting until further notice. Realizing I was now transferred to the Sex Offender's block, behind two locked steel doors.

I was unable to call my parents, and now also I do not know my account login & password. The inmates in the other cellblock stole my paperwork, hacked my account, and took the other $40 in my possession that the first officer gave me out of my wallet into their commissary for coffee.

I was unable to manage to get an officer to help me for days, obviously ignored intentionally. Buzzing on the intercom for hours throughout the day to help me log into my account to make one final call.

Being only told over the intercom, that I was being moved back into the same cell block that I started in.

I lucked out, and they had to sanitize the whole block head to toe because somebody complained about lice being found in their bunk. Shaving our heads off, and making us shower naked in front of them to make sure no spread.

I managed to convince an inmate into giving me a free 5-minute call, off his account. After two days. Telling me ""Never give up,"" after ringing me up a call.

My parents picked up, and I tried to calmly explain my situation. It ended in them telling me ""We'll be there to pick you up in the morning, we're going to bed."" Hung up on.

I hadn't slept in 4 days straight, on top of the week in psychosis before. I wasn't eating food, only water fasting with Kool-Aide sugar packet water because the food was inedible.

In the morning, before breakfast is served. I got my call to be arraigned on my second-coming charges, and then I was supposed to be moved back.

Walking in the hallway, and into the elevators.

Passing another Officer, that had my RO (Release Out) paperwork. Noticed my face, and said ""Is this ""....., ....... ?"". The officer handling me was surprised feet away from the courtroom.

Walked me in, and asked the Judge if I was ""Free to go?"", and the Judge nodded.

""He's free to go.""

I also got my first charge dropped after two months out of jail, and I pleaded insanity.

\-

During my 3 1/2 week hospital visit, after jail. Where I fought verbally and emotionally with the Head Doctor this time, over my ""Austim misdiagnosis"" 

I made a ""friendship bracelet"" that said the girl's name that I fell in love with back in High School, and the same one that got a restraining order on me. It was for a memories sake because I was losing track of time 

Meeting a lady there for two weeks, and on her last two days before getting discharged. She telling me that she was diagnosed with Pulmonary Lung Cancer, 

Another patient told me that he was going to kill himself, and I made friends with him. He had just been released from prison and moved here. He was depressed, and shot himself in the mouth; a bullet ricocheted into his skull. Making him eyeless in one eye, and not killing him.  

During my inpatient stay, I was notified that my charges from 2017 were expunged.

This year, 2024.

My Grandfather had been battling a five-year-long battle with his health in decline because of Alzheimer's'. Passing away this year. 

My Dad got really abusive drunk one night, saw that I spent $200 at a museum gift shop in a manic episode, 

I came home and me and him got into a fight where he attempted to choke me, and grabbed me by the throat. The neighbors heard us fighting the whole night, and weirdly enough; right as my Dad grabbed my throat. The doorbell rang simultaneously, and a police officer heard me scream ""HELP"" My dad grabbing my neck, my Mom tried to break us apart. 

Police officer waving red beam dot in my face and all across my whole family chest, 

Right after the police kicked in my Childhood home door 

I had an NDE where I tried to take my own life. I drove at 100mph and crashed into a tree line on purpose, totaled my car, and salvaged it. I didn't have a seat belt on, and my kneecaps went under the steering wheel, coming out walking on my own with just getting two stitches to my right eye. 

I received a DUI that night but was only taken to the hospital because I was only high and not drunk, they took my blood level and found six months later that I had marijuana in my bloodstream. They let me go that night without arresting me. 

I received an EEG where it was for my ""Autism misdiagnosis"", and confirmed that I was still schizoaffective bipolar. 40x higher more sensitivity than the regular human to anxiety. OCD, 

Also, a life-changing diagnosis. Amnestic Disorder. Or, Hereditary, Short-Term Memory Loss. 

6 months later, at the start of the month. On the 2nd, I was issued my charges for my arrest for my DUI, but then the next day, I had two warrants for my arrest. 

I had been in communication with the local Crisis Intervention team at my local county police department after I was arrested, and trying to explain to her it was me trying to take my life. They sympathized and talked to the prosecutor, who talked to the judge who had my bail posted before being arrested and jailed.  So I wouldn't have to sit in jail for 24 hours until seeing a judge, getting my bail posted, and then being bailed out. 

The same guy that made fun of my dead best friend, and dated the love of my life. Drove past me when I drove by his road the other day near his house. He laughed visibly from his windshield, I could see when spotting me driving in the opposite direction on the road from him going to his house. 

I had posted about my most recent suicide attempt online to my social media, and the girl with the restraining order noticed. I posted about receiving the diagnosis of Short Term Memory Loss, and ironically enough. Her college's sorority's main donation focus is Memory loss, with Dementia & Alzheimer's. Have raised and donated more than $9 million to the Alzheimer’s Association.

I may be delusional again, but she seems receptive to the diagnosis, but sad and concerned about the failed suicide attempt. 

I deleted my Instagram recently to make a new one.  I got blocked by her again, but she was her best friend. The same one that told me, ""You're not alone,"" & ""I set you free for freedom's sake! :). Never give up there are always brighter days around the corner."" ... She doesn't have me blocked, which she has for the last 5 years on my other Instagrams'.

I've followed her a lot and unfollowed her to notify her phone through Instagram follower request notifications for a silent alarm message, to check my Instagram. I've been posting new photos. 

I've been tagging her friend in posts, and commenting on photos'  atting her, allowing me to talk to her. Apologizing, and trying to make her happy on her birthday month.

1gase3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerSuccess/comments/1gase3l/awards_season_is_here/,Awards Season is Here,"So, if you spend any time on that other hellsite (linkedin) you've probably noticed that it's ""I'm a top -25, -50, -100 CS influencer"" season. 

I'm sure there's a lot of smart people who get this kind of recognition. But please remember that there are just as many grifters. There's no objective assessment with these awards other than their ability to get attention. It's essentially a popularity contest dominated by people who have the time to produce a lot of content and tag every other influencer they've ever had a coffee with. It's a self-reinforcing guru ouroboros. 

You should never feel bad if you aren't on these lists. Often the people who are doing the work IRL are far too busy to build an audience. It is not a reflection of your skill or experience. 

I implore you to think critically about what these influencers say. What they say maybe brilliant or they may just be full of shit. Or have had very specific experiences that may or may not apply to you. You might have even noticed that a few of these folks even behave combatively to drive engagement for themselves.

Seeking advice and perspective is natural and I bet most of us have gotten a lot out of joining this subred or following some of these folks. But sometimes, I don't know, it feels a little too culty and all these people touting their ""ranking"" is when it feels that way the most, at least for me. 

As someone who as been at this for a few decades, I think the best thing you can do for your career is to develop real mentoring relationships. Having one person or a select group of trusted people who you can bounce specifics off of, who understand your situation, and who know who you are--is unbelievably valuable in a way a parasocial relationship cannot be.

Being an engineer, my workdays are pretty hectic, and after squeezing in a quick gym session, I often find myself getting home late. But I've got a bit of a cleanliness freak and OCD thing going on. To keep from putting things off, I've got a little habit: I come home, whip up an instant coffee, put on a podcast, and dive right into chores. That's unpacking boxes, sorting stuff, sweeping and mopping, loading the laundry, hanging clothes, and taking out the trash. The whole shebang takes me about an hour and a half.

1gas7qd,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnneagramTypeMe/comments/1gas7qd/filled_questionnaire_and_speculation/,Filled Questionnaire and speculation,"I've been really into enneagram lately (I’ve been posting and active as of late) and wanted to see what this sounds like.
General consensus has been 6 core but I’m not entirely sure. 

I decided to do a general questionnaire (By u/Brouhaus) to get a better idea as to what my ideals and motivations are;

**Tell me about your internal experience of yourself. What makes you, you?**

This is a tough question. I guess I am just me. My experience of myself If I had to explain would be “by a thread”- it's like my true nature has always been there, shadowing me and wanting to engage with the world. Some people say they are their values or what they produce, what they mean to others and personally I just feel as if I “am”. 

As of late I've done a lot of introspection, reconnecting with what was and what I used to love doing. I feel as though I haven't been myself as of late and enneagram is a great tool to help get to the nitty gritty of how, what, when and why. I just seek to understand and to have that awareness. I will say, I'm more in touch with my negative traits than I am my positive ones.

I guess I can get easily jaded, I do have a way I wish I were treated and an inherent want to be kind. Interacting with the outside world and how harsh it can be has made me apprehensive to extend that olive branch because often, it’s swatted away. It's not that I think humanity is inherently evil or that it’s that simple- it just is. Unfortunate.

I don't feel as though I answered this well, but it's what I know.

**You just had a really good day. Describe it. It can be a real recent example or an aspirational one.**

I had a great day recently- I was off work and woke up early enough to make a nice breakfast for myself, went and got myself a nice little coffee and sat down to do some paperwork I'd been neglecting. It was nice to not be on the move and to tick off the “to-do’s” of what’s been long set aside. 

I think my best days are when I don't have a set plan or obligations or work  and I’m able to just be and do whatever looks interesting. Don't get me wrong, a loose structure (Early risings, basic hygiene, etc.) are important but I find it nice to go visit places that used to and still make me happy. Indulging in a new book or sketchbook, or baking and trying a new cute craft, etc. I love not feeling rushed and like I have time to just sit and work on fun lore/drawing/design concepts, ideas.

**If someone is upset with you, what is the typical reason for it? Give a recent example.**

When I seem inconsiderate. I don't mean too, I actually try my best to be aware.

A recent example was me being busy at work and missing a few things, knowing I would come back to it later when I wasn't busy and my coworker being upset about it assuming I left a mess.

**What are you like when you're stressed? What are your coping mechanisms? Give an example of a recent stressful situation and how you handled it.**

I kind of shut down and focus on the task at hand. I get agitated with any obstacles that make things harder. I work harder and when I get home, I will neglect chores/everyday needs and seek to distract myself. I often find myself craving smoke or alcohol and try to make plans with friends as soon as possible.

 I’ll often get home after a long stressful day, then think about something I’ve been wanting or craving and no matter how small.. I'll go get it and spend more money than I should. I'm way more impulsive and afterwards I usually feel anxiety and guilt for my choices.

**What pushes your buttons? What makes you angry? How does your anger manifest? Can you be openly angry with others?**

People who are extra, self-deprecating humor, Loud abrupt noises, plans that were made that I'm apparently part of without my consent. Nit-picking. Strict rules with no explanation. General inconsiderate behavior, hypocrites, people who are fine remaining ignorant and unresponsive for no reason other than spite. People making assumptions rather than just asking me.

My anger manifests quietly, but if I'm annoyed I can usually cool myself down quickly. If it’s work related, I usually just focus on the task and block everything out until I can deal with it later but I can get short and direct with customers. If it's friends, I just get quiet and distance myself, I don't like to vent and when I do, I usually do a bad job of explaining. I don't elaborate but it's obvious I’m a little off kilter.

I have had moments that only close loved ones see, where I just lose my shit and explode, especially if what I'm saying is being misunderstood. It takes a lot to get me to that point, I usually cry in frustration. 

**What’s your deepest fear? Why is that your fear?**

That's the thing, I don't know but I know a few things that are terrifying to me.

 Working though life to get to the point where I can enjoy it, only to be old and unable to. Being in a vegetative state and unable to communicate or locked into my body, Loss of control. Having zero freedom to make my own choices.

**What types of memories cause you the most shame? What feelings cause you the most shame? What is it about them that causes you shame?**

Weirdly enough, I'm pretty sexually repressed. I went through some things that made it hard to enjoy, be in the moment and connect to my partner. I’d also had my parents invade my space and find things that weren't any of their business.. It's violating. Any memories of my sexual experience or expression. I'm very private. I don't get how people discuss it freely, I don't want to be seen as a slave to my desires, I guess.

One other thing would be when I was growing up and going through things and treating people with unnecessary cruelty. I don't like thinking back on when I did stuff out of impulse or went for what I wanted without consideration and out of desperation. Its the fact that it isn't how I really am.

**What is your relationship with pleasure? What gives you pleasure? Can you have pleasure when you want it, or do you have to earn it?**

I mean.. One aspect as stated above. My relationship with pleasure is complicated. I don't feel as though I have an inherent belief that I don't deserve it and when it comes naturally I embrace it. I seek it out through everyday life, even just in small ways, like my hobbies. I feel I do go through long droughts without pleasure and in stress seek it out in excess, because I suppose it's making up for lost time and I deserve it.

**What’s your relationship with authority? Think both abstractly and with specific authorities in your life, possibly your parents, boss, religious leader, doctor, or government figures? Are you an authority?**

Family- I'm reluctant to share much of my goings on, besides work or creative projects/trips. 

Parents wise, I’m closer to my mom because we relate more. She was a very positive influence in my life and embraced my inherited traits and creativity.

My father was partially absent and didn't know how to father. When I was younger I was scared/angry with him, but now that I'm older, I understand and have sympathy. He was very aggressive and would lecture me or force me into things I didn't even want to do and get mad at me for not excelling. I don't hold it against him, however he acts in repentance. He has regrets and tries to support me now, although I don't need it or ever truly expect it- never surprised nor disappointed.

I don't know much about political figures to have an educated opinion other than they’re both extreme and dumb at times. 

Religious figures, I respect when it's used for actual good, to inspire and nurture community and shared ideals instead of spreading fear. I personally don't subscribe to anything in particular.

Jobs and bosses are tricky, I actually made a posting of this on the enneagram6 sub relating to this. I'm a notorious job hopper (I call it the one year curse) so it's safe to say I don't have much of a commitment to anywhere in mind besides what I actually wanna go to school for. I can respect some bosses when they treat me like another person, but not care for or do the minimum for those who treat me with disrespect. 


**When your mind wanders, what are you thinking about?**

Whatever I'm currently obsessed with (Enneagram, music, media, lore, etc.), or my own ideas and concepts for world-building. I'm usually thinking about my personal interests or concepts, kind of like autopilot. Rarely is it current happenings, unless it's pressing and distressing.

**You have a big decision to make. Describe how you decide what to do.**

Take a step back, consider and weigh the experience, the lesser evil, the one that makes the most sense, then come to a conclusion. I need time to know and fully understand just what I'm deciding on, especially if it's something “big”.

**What’s your biggest flaw?**

I can never ask for help, it's like I forget it's even an option.  I always find ways to throw duct-tape at an issue until I can deny it no longer. It's embarrassing. 

**What makes you special? (Or, if you don't feel special, what at least makes you different from other people?)**

I mean, with so many other people on the planet it's hard to feel special. Objectively there's only one you, I guess I feel honored to be able to make of what “I” am and that I have the capacity and control to decide that for myself. 

**How much of your mental energy is spent on thinking about each of the past, the present, and the future?**

I think about the future a lot, because I'm excited for it. Probably the past second, because while it's pretty bleak there's still feelings and experiences that were unforgettable, yes, the “good old days” even if they weren’t all that good. Present is last, because I don't exactly feel satisfied with where I am now- I am practicing gratitude.

**You unexpectedly find yourself with a whole weekend with no obligations, and everyone else is busy. How do you feel about it? What do you do?**

Anything I've been wanting to do for a while. Setting up a comfortable structure for myself, engaging in my interests, getting work done that's been on the back burner. relaxing. If I have enough money, I would probably spend a little on something that might have caught my eye but I haven't had time for. 

**What’s your personal vibe/style/aesthetic? How cultivated vs natural is it, and how much time do you spend on it? Do you turn it on and off?**

That's tough, I kind of just like what I like and cultivate it- which is a mixed bag. I pick and choose bits from various media/styles/etc. and just make my own thing. I like perusing Pinterest and just putting together things I like, even if they don't make much sense together. I just collect various pretty things.

It’s whatever comes naturally and I usually don't think much of it nor do I spend much time refining it. I wouldn't say I turn it off/on either, it just is.

**Which of the following is the most like you? Explain. A) I know what I want, I go out and make it happen, and people won't stop me. B) I am content to be on my own and not draw too much attention to myself. C) I have to be responsible and dedicated, and I put others’ needs first.**

B. I won't bother anyone else if they don't bother me and I respect those who just live and let live. I'm perfectly fine on my own and often daydream about having my own little home in a loft cabin with comfortable amenities. When I’m in public I'm just quiet, go and get what I need, maybe look around a little bit then move on.

**Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I dislike stress and negative vibes, and I may try to distract myself from my problems. B) I have strong feelings, get worked up easily, and am not afraid to show it. C) I don’t like to let my feelings show; they get in the way of being efficient and logical.**

C mostly and A. I do tend to throw myself into distractions and try to keep a reasonably positive outlook but I'm not in denial. I don't like to let my feelings show unless I’ve had the chance to sort them out and know why I feel that way. I wouldn't be taken seriously if I didn't handle them well.

**Which of the following is most like you? Explain. A) I look to others for feedback and guidance and am willing to be flexible when needed. B) I am always aware of how things could be better, and I’m disappointed that they are not. C) Deep down, I am afraid people won’t give me what I need unless I make it worth their while.**

It's hard to pick one, so I'll answer why I feel each of them apply.

1. Just to get a general and well rounded idea of different perceptions or things I wouldn’t have considered. I don't change my decision or considerations unless I feel it aligns with my own.
2. Yes, I notice a lot of things could be better or optimal, but I don’t feel comfortable bringing it up unless asked.  I'll turn a blind eye not to deal with it because I feel I don't have the influence, power or know enough about it to enact anything. 
3. Yes. I feel like a lot of things are transactional and hate being tied down or obligated or “owed”, it's why I prefer to work things out myself.

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Alternative short questionnaire**

**Take your time to think about it, and try to write 3-5 sentences for each.**

* **If you're feeling negative emotions, do you show those emotions to others? Do you let your feelings out, do you try to look on the bright side, or do you put them down and aside so that you can be logical?**

I don't show them unless they are close to me, even then I try to just keep it to myself. I do try to keep a positive outlook but with a healthy dose of realism so as not to be disappointed. I do try to think objectively but I need time.

* **When you are your worst self, what are you like and what's driving that?**

When I am my worst self I'm impulsive, selfish, dismissive, neglectful and snap at everyone who asks me if i'm okay. It's usually when I feel overwhelmed, or when it's one thing after another.

* **What’s your biggest strength? What’s your biggest flaw?**

I don’t have just one for each unfortunately. Strengths would be perspective, creativity and empathy. Weaknesses would be sensitivity, overthinking and feeling weak.

* **When you are getting in your own way, what does that look like and why does it happen?**

I can get stuck on loops, reminisce, think about what should've been instead of what is now and the possibilities. I can be ungrateful, feel as though I’ll never have what I need. It happens when things feel like they never stop piling on, when I get overwhelmed and have a lot of obligations at once. Instead of compartmentalizing and getting them over with.

* **What are your behaviors that cause you to get into conflict with other people?**

Not taking immediate action, doing something in an eccentric way and then calling it out, overthinking things and doing it “Harder not smarter”, not begging for forgiveness when I make a mistake and apologizing. I tend to be accused of not paying attention but it's not true.

**The last two questions felt redundant to the ones I’d answered previously about anger and fear.**",1,1729736806.0,EnneagramTypeMe,0,1.0,False
1gas70j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gas70j,Bike is life,"Papajort adjusted his wide-brimmed hat, eyes gleaming with excitement. Today was a great day biking adventure—an idea that sparked over his morning coffee. His old bicycle (venzo 26er) but reliable, stood waiting by the gate like a trusted steed.

He hopped on, grinning ear to ear, and pedaled down the dirt road that wound through hills and meadows. The wind whistled in his ears as the landscape whizzed by, a blur of vibrant greens and wildflowers. Every bump and turn in the road was met with laughter—Papajort had long learned that life's rough patches were just part of the journey.

As he reached the base of a steep hill, he paused, panting but undeterred. With a determined huff, he stood up on the pedals and pushed onward, slowly inching his way up. Sweat trickled down his forehead, but the thrill of the climb kept him going. Reaching the top, he let out a triumphant yell that echoed through the valley below.

The view was breathtaking—endless fields, rolling hills, and a golden sunset stretching across the sky. Papajort took it all in, resting for a moment to soak in the beauty before heading down the hill. The descent was exhilarating, the wind rushing through his beard as he flew down the slope, free as a bird.

By the time he reached home, twilight had settled in. Tired but fulfilled, Papajort leaned his bike against the porch and smiled. Another adventure, another story to tell.",6,1729736750.0,mountainbiking,1,0.8,False

1gas3oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterAnime/comments/1gas3oz/coffee_and_alcohol_symbolism/,Coffee and Alcohol Symbolism?,"Just finished Monster and thought it was fantastic. I loved the characters and the overall plot and themes of the story (though I’m still kinda struggling to understand Johan a bit). But enough about that, I wanted to have a discussion about something I noticed a bit with certain characters and that was the contrast between the coffee and alcohol and how its used as a medium for development and character psyche. 

I may be reaching on some of these, but I’d still love some other perspectives on this. Also apologies if this has been brought up before, I searched the web and it didn’t seem like anyone discussed it so I wanted to see what others thought. Also this may be a bit disorganized, but bear with me 😅.

So first character, and really the character that got me really thinking about the whole thing, was Eva. For a majority of the show, she wallows in her own self-loathing and jealousy that it takes root in her habit of drinking and getting wasted. The alcohol metaphorically imo seems like an amalgamation of the ugly things within a person’s character. In Eva’s case it’s her greed, possessive and obsessive relationship with Tenma, and her subtle issue with abandonment. She refuses to take proper measures to reconcile with her demons and at some point starts believing that she is beyond redemption or forgiveness, which is why it seems like she has a death wish at times imo. But that meeting she has with Martin and his eventual death changes her. She realizes her life has value and to persevere through all of life’s ills. Throughout all the darkness, there’s still a hope that everything turns out ok. I find it hard to believe that almost the scene directly after she learns of Martin’s passing, she starts drinking coffee. Essentially what I’m getting at is alcohol shows a character embracing or consumed by the negativities of life while coffee represents hope for the future.

I feel like this can be further seen with Robert earlier in the story. Robert’s drinking basically cost him everything and that bottle of whiskey almost always seems to taunt and remind him of both his mistakes and imperfections. One of my favorite scenes was that scene where Robert learns his daughter doesn’t want to see him. He looks around and seems like he’s about to relapse, and after a tense moment he says “One coffee please”. He didn’t give up and still held hope that one day he’ll finally be able to build that relationship with his daughter he yearned for. I also think that Johan, who at this point had been built up to be a figure of pure evil, being the one who mentally breaks him down and offers him a bottle adds heavily to the symbolism. Almost like a literal devil on his shoulder, tempting him to give up and sadly he did. 

You can also see coffee as a lens for somebody who is trying to reconnect with their humanity. Grimmer and that one ex-assassin were both emotionally stunted individuals with bloodstained pasts yet you can find them drinking coffee at some point or another. Almost like being able to simply enjoy the mundanity of a cup of coffee perfectly exemplifies what it feels to be a human. 

Again, I might be stretching so what do you guys think?

### Background 

Set a goal of running a marathon and doing an Olympic Triathlon in 2024. 

 I don’t have a strong fitness background/base. Intermittently lifted weights from 2017-2020. Then post Covid I set goals to achieve 1000lbs within my big 3 lifts. Which I did. 

I had to set my sights on a new goal. I set the goal of running a half marathon last year (2023) which I was able to do! 

Before 2023, I had maybe cumulatively run 150km across my life. 

But 2024 I had loftier goals and I knew I had to take running more seriously. 

Unfortunately I suffer from AS/SI and when I get flare ups I pretty much cannot do any lower body workouts. (Hence my lack of running history) 



### Training 

I created my own training plan loosely based on Hal Higdon’s Novice 1. However between June - Aug I had incorporated more Swimming and Cycling to prep for my Triathlon and was running about 3 times a week. I was also going to the gym 3-4 times a week. 

Unfortunately I got Covid during late June, early July so I missed 2 weeks of training and the subsequent weeks were basically unproductive as my body still wasn’t at 100%. 


My stupid self rushed back into my workouts and this cause alot of aches and pains and general fatigue throughout. so I had to take about 4 days off from training. 

Unfortunately I hit yet another roadblock as the week leading up to my Triathlon, I had an AS flare up and was not able to run properly. I had to finish my triathlon with a run/walk. 

The 2 subsequent weeks were also lost due to my AS flare up. 

Thankfully I was able to run again and was able to lock in for the final 6 weeks of training. 

I had to skip my 20 mile run due to time crunch, so ended up with my longest run being 30k, with a peak week of 71k. 

The training didn’t go to plan and lost about 5 weeks of training in total. Had accumulated 850km YTD. 


### Pre-race 

Started my taper 3 weeks out. The first week was fine but the last 2 weeks I had the full on crazies. With insane aches and pains, night cramps and self doubt. But I was assured this was normal. 

The week leading up to the race I heavily focused on drinking fluids and eating almost nothing but carbs. Focused on eating Bagels, White Bread, Graham Crackers, Oats, white Rice, Potatoes and Bananas. Drank a Gatorade and Coconut Water everyday. 


### RACE DAY

We were blessed with perfect weather… for a park day. Debatably this weather wasn’t super ideal for a marathon. Temperature reached a high of 21 Celsius and Sun was out in full effect. While it was cool enough that I wouldn’t overheat, the Sun made it a lot tougher than partly cloudy would’ve. 

I made sure to get up early, eat oats, a bagel, a banana, 2 cups of coffee and a Gatorade. Got to the start line early and stayed the in hotel lobby to do my foam rolling and warmups. Made sure to use the loo 3 times (had to force myself to go). Took a tums before the race to help ease my butterflies. 

I initially planned to run at about a 7 min/km pace and looked for the pacers but I guess they had none running that slow. So I said I would go off feel. 

The first kilometre I felt good but due to the sheer number of people, my watch couldn’t get a good reading on the pace I was running at so I went off feel which ended up being slightly faster than 7min/km. But I trusted the feeling. 

1-21k were pretty much perfect. I was going at a pace faster than I had aimed for but I didn’t feel tired, I felt relaxed and energized. I made sure to drink water + electrolytes at every station and fuelled with gels every 4K. 

Post km21 I felt the fatigue start to settle in, but I still had energy to push. At km 29 is where I really started to feel the dumps. I wasn’t able to down anymore gels. My stomach was turning but I didn’t want to wait in a line for the toilet as I was hitting an ideal speed. My arms and back were starting to feel tired and tight. My legs seemed to be doing ok, but I definitely knew I was starting to push my limits. 

At km 32 I lucked out and was able to use a port a potty with no line. Did my business and felt so much better. Took another gel here, finally. Was able to fly through to km 35 pretty easily. 

KM 35 - 40 is really where the mental battle started. The stretch had no shade and was a turnaround stretch so it felt so familiar. The sun was beating down, no breeze to cool me down. I saw people starting to drop like flies due to heat, injury or just general fatigue. There were no crowd here, no one cheering you on, it was just yourself and the other runners around you. I told myself I would take short breaks at every aid station but I had to keep running. 

Km 40 I was defeated. I had just climbed the final hill and walked a couple metres to take a brief rest. I had to keep going I was so close. My arms were tired, my legs were tired. My mind was tired. But victory was right there. I lucked out and my friend was waiting in that final stretch to cheer for me. He ran with me for 1.5km to give me the last bit of motivation to push myself to the end. I picked up the pace as much as I could for that final stretch. My vision was getting blurry, but the finish was right there. And I did it. 


### Post Race 


I finally achieved my goal of running a marathon. I felt so accomplished despite being barely able to walk. I was able to complete it faster than I thought I could. Even though I felt like I left nothing in the tank, I do wish I pushed a bit harder to get sub 4:30, but that’s a challenge for another time. 

The difference between a full and a half marathon is no joke. That last stretch on the marathon is so mentally and physically demanding I was almost brought to tears. But I’m so happy I pushed through. It’s time to rest and refocus now for the next challenge.

I've been a DM for the past 4 years but mostly for sessions online so I don't have much experience with running games for people in person. So I was curious to know what do the last minute prep moments LOOK like for the GMs out there? Or to add another level, what do they FEEL like?

I know there are lots of great resources out there for last minute prep tips and recommendations for making sure you're on top of the story etc. However I'm more interested to know, what are you actually doing in the time that leads up to the session?

Personally I'm not a person who's good at following a sets of steps. So my build up tends to be a quick scan of notes, ideas and pictures at a surface level. Often grabbing a coffee while I think on it for a moment. Then usually I'll start pulling a bunch of maps from online, that might be good fits for potential upcoming sections. And inevitably hoping people turn up a few minutes late so I can flesh out some ideas further.

I'm grateful to say this method works for me pretty well. Although the slap dash style in the early days definitely had me experiencing lots of anxiety filled wishing I could cancel the session!
