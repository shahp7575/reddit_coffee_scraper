1quhsug,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1quhsug/did_we_just_go_on_a_date_or_was_that_just_a/,Did we just go on a date? Or was that just a friendly hangout?,"hi all! 

  
I (20 blasian F) work with this guy (22 Asian M) at a campus restaurant since Aug ’25. he is praised at work for being handsome, but is known for being introverted, quiet, shy, blunt, and reserved. We would work (just the two of us since its a small restaurant) once a week, and to my surprise, he was quite talkative, funny, and sarcastic. After just 2-3 shift we would have lengthy conversations, and are conversations were always filled with teasing and bickering. At first, I saw him as just friends, but then I realized I would start looking forward to seeing him.

  
Last week, I decided to ask him if he wanted to go get Cake with me from a local cake shop since we had talked about the place before. We had never really texted and had never hung out outside of work so he said question caught him by surprise, but said sure. 

  
The night before we hung out he invited to pick me up and I took up the offer. Up until this point i figured it was a hangout to “test the waters.” but him picking me up gave me this sense that it may be a date…

on the hangout, we went to the cake shop and it had no seating (which I knew it didn’t). he pointed it out and I offered if he wanted to find a place to sit down and he said yes. we ended up going to a coffee shop, where he insisted to pay for BOTH our coffees and took photos of our cakes and coffee.

  
after an hour of VERY good conversation (back and forth teasing and making him belly laugh) he asks if ive eaten dinner and suggests going to go get food. we then go to dinner and he insists on paying again.

  
after the hangout, I posted a photo of our food and coffee on my instagram (you can’t see anything but his hands), and he slides up and tells me to tag him. I tag him and he reposts it with my instagram pfp and handle in it.

  
After this all of coworkers went to me and asked wtf what was happening…however I didn’t know what to say because I didn’t know what the vibes were. I was told by his friends that he’s not the type to go and hangout with people, let alone pay for them.

  
I Was really confident that he was interested but a coworker informed me that he said he only dates within his ethnicity and speaks his first language (which I’m neither of those) And the coworker said he was hard to read and nonchalant.

  
im just really confused because it seems like the people around me are talking about a completely different person: nonchalant, closed off, etc. and i know a talkative, witty, sarcastic person. Apart of me hopes that he told that coworker that because he was putting walls up, but another part of me thinks he was being genuine and I mistook his friendliness as romance.

I just can’t understand how we could hang out for 4 hours, him pay for coffee and dinner, have conversations about MBTI, love language, his own personal gossip, funny teasing, and moments of staring without it being seen as romance?

  
I also would’ve never asked him to hang out if I didn’t see signs before the hangout?? At work he would stare at me for long periods of time, and when I would ask why he was looking he wouldnt say anything, he would ask me personal questions, ask our coworkers who he knew were close to me about me…

  
helpppp am I delusionallllll??



a little additional context about me: I’m a pretty high standards girl (sorry lol) and so I don’t go on dates very often. Whenever I do go on dates, I have always left feeling drained, bored, etc. I usually leave a date liking the person less than before due not bonding with the person. I find that a lot of the guys that ask me on dates are quite shallow which is why I tend to look a personality rather than appearance. That being said, when I first met my coworker I thought he was handsome but I did not like further than that, it wasn’t until I saw his personality that I started to like him. I wanted to clarify this because I didn’t want to seem like I was creating stuff in my head lollll.

Lastly, I keep hearing about Amex + Rakuten being good... if this isn't the right sub for that, disregard. But I'm interested in folk's thoughts.

Chapter 1

The day before returning from a business trip, I

noticed a new entry on my weight-tracking app, showing someone 7 pounds lighter than me. I immediately changed my flight to come home early. The snack cupboard was half empty, and the fridge was devoid of my usual sodas, replaced instead with strawberry- flavored milk, which I couldn't stand. On the coffee table sat several packs of strawberry- flavored cookies, something neither my husband nor I ever ate. I called my husband directly: ""Has someone been here recently?"" After a month away, it felt like someone else had moved into our home. His hesitation was noticeable: ""Um...Vincenzo brought his girlfriend over for a bit yesterday. Why?"" I softly replied, ""Just curious,"" and hung up. Then I quickly checked Vincenzo's girlfriend's Instagram, and her latest post was, ""Help! Who else gets a bad allergic reaction to strawberries?

I’m in my second year of college studying communications, but outside of class I spend a lot of time listening to music (indie, folk, and the occasional hyperpop deep dive), playing cozy games like Stardew Valley, and trying out new art mediums currently dabbling in digital drawing. I also love casual hiking, bad reality TV, and exploring little coffee shops in my area.

I’m the kind of person who loves both deep, meaningful conversations and sending absolutely ridiculous memes back and forth. I’m empathetic, a good listener, and genuinely interested in learning about other people’s lives, passions, and perspectives.

I’m ideally looking for friends who are also in their late teens or early 20s, anywhere in the world, who are down to chat regularly on here or eventually move to Discord/Snap. Whether you want to talk daily or just check in a few times a week, I’d love to build a real, lasting friendship.

How to establish better control?,"I need some outside perspective here because I feel like I’m being gaslit. My girlfriend and I have been together for two years, and initially, things were perfect. She fit the visual profile I require for a partner perfectly. But lately, she’s been letting herself go, and it’s honestly disrespectful to the effort I put into curating our lifestyle. We agreed early on (I stated it clearly and she didn't object) that 125 lbs is the hard ceiling for her frame. It’s not about health, it’s about maintaining the asset value of the relationship and ensuring she remains visually compatible with me.



The problem is she’s currently sitting at 127.4 lbs according to yesterday’s daily weight report. I have her step on the scale every morning at 6:00 AM sharp, before water or coffee, so I can log the data into our shared spreadsheet for tracking her weight. I’ve tried to be supportive and proactive. I’ve completely taken over the grocery shopping so she doesn't get tempted by garbage, and I’ve explicitly banned carbohydrates after 2 PM. I even instituted a structured snack allowance where she gets one plain, unsalted rice cake at 3 PM if her morning weigh-in was within spec. If she’s over, that privilege is obviously revoked until she stabilizes. It’s a simple incentive structure, yet she complains about being ""lightheaded"" or ""starving."" It feels wildly manipulative and dramatic.



I actually caught her sneaking a granola bar from her work bag last Tuesday and I nearly lost it. I had to sit her down and explain that calories are a budget, and she’s spending money she doesn’t have. I’ve started randomly auditing her purse and coat pockets for contraband when she gets home, but I suspect she’s eating at the office behind my back. It’s the deceit that hurts the most, honestly.



I’m looking for advice from other men who successfully manage their partner's intake. What practical control measures have you found successful to stop the sneaking? I’m thinking about maybe installing a Wyze cam in the kitchen facing the pantry or perhaps requesting photos of her lunch every day with a timestamp so I can approve the portion size. Is that effective, or do they just find other ways to cheat?

Go online after coffee and get a rider pretty quick. Shit money, but I want the practice. Take a selfie, on my way.

Holy crap, the CarPlay version of the  app is useless. Considering in CA the cops will pull you over for even *touching* your phone while driving, you'd think Uber would put more effort into a platform that is supposed to *help drivers interact with their device while driving*.

Drop off the rider. Uber notifies me of ""suspicious activity."" Apparently, I ""used a different device"" to manage the ride as I did to take my selfie. Well, duh: CarPlay doesn't have a camera, and not supposed to use the phone while driving. Send such statement to Uber. Back online.

My second ride *ever*. Where are they going? My former employer. Thank goodness I didn't know the guy.

Next ride is picking someone up from the airport. Cool. If you can afford to fly, you're probably not going to carjack me. Says she's at stop 9. I'm looking at the stop 9 sign and she's not there. My trunk opens. I'm fast enough to help her with her suitcase, but in my head I'm grumbling ""you were *not* at stop 9...""

The navigation voice is either ^(inaudible) or ***LOUD AS FUCK***. Also, the app consistently tells me my pickup is on the opposite side they're actually standing on. Helpful.

I haven't yet added an account to get paid out to. Better do that. D'oh, ""suspicious activity"" again. Look, I'm going to need access to the pittance I'm going to earn doing this. Is it really so suspicious to add a means to do so on the first day? Take selfie. Oops, there was a problem. Quit app, start again. Take another selfie. That works.

I have a feeling I'm going to be taking more selfies than \[insert hip young influencer here\].

Second airport pickup. *Now* it tells me I need a placard to do rides at the airport. Oops.  (Apparently, a piece of paper that says ""Uber"" will suffice until they can mail me one. Security theater at the airport. Why am I surprised.)

I’m a university student from Mexico and I’m thinking of studying abroad in Australia during my Aug-Dec 2026 semester, so I’d probably be there Jul-Nov depending on the uni calendar. I’m trying to pick a city where I can train consistently on the road with minimal rain/wet roads (I’m cautious about descending in the wet cause I'm a coward). I prefer warmer weather, my ideal 20–25°C, a decent range is 15–35°C and anything below that I can tolerate but don’t like it lol. I won’t have a car so I’ll either have to use public transport or just ride from wherever I am staying… I’m gonna try to see if I can live on-campus but I won’t really know specific locations until I get accepted into a school... The sucky part is that we are supposed to rank our choices from 1 to 7 and that’s the order they get sent to schools, so I won’t really get to decide between multiple unis once I send my application.  



Riding profile: 

* I like road and MTB, I’ll probably only take my road and might rent a MTB if there’s any in the area :))
* Ride 5x per week for about 8-13 hrs 
* I like morning rides to avoid traffic and to make it to class… currently I ride 6 to 7:30 am weekdays, weekends 8-9 am to 10am-12 pm depends on the ride
* I enjoy climbs and flat roads, but I feel like I can maintain a better pace in the mountains because there are no stoplights and fewer cars…  



These are the universities that I’m considering: 

* Brisbane: University of Queensland (hopefully St Lucia) / Griffith University (hopefully Nathan campus)
* Sydney: University of Sydney / or The University of New South Wales (but I’m a bit scared that it might rain too often in Sydney)
* Adelaide: University of Adelaide (hesitant that I’ll be arriving right when it’s rain season)
* Melbourne: University of Melbourne (I’ve read it rains constantly so I’m approaching w caution)
* Canberra: Australian National University (I’m concerned about the cold… like I’ve gone when it’s -2 out but man the wind sucks)



If you could help me with any of these, I’d be super grateful :)

* How consistent is the riding in any of these cities from July to Nov?
* Are there any local group rides/clubs that you know of?
* How bad is magpie season? I’m lowk a bit scared of you guys’ wildlife :(
* Which city fits a calmer social vibe? I’m not into partying/drinking/smoking, I prefer outdoors + coffee + board/video games, and I’m introverted but ofc I do want to meet people and make new friends :D

we’ve really emphasized that it’s not that we want him to be one thing or another, we just want him to be happy and living life. school, a trade, part time job, full time, volunteering, literally anything. even meet an old friend for coffee. he has this one friend who started reaching out to me and my mom, because after all this time he cares and worries, but he just wont talk to anyone.

he is very pessimistic about the world, which is reasonable, and i get that way too. but he seems to have taken the stance of if the world is so fucked up and unfair and unable to be fixed, why should he have to try to live a fake, presentable life. which i totally understand. i’ve been there too. the thing is, i was that way too when my mental health was at its worst. i’ve come to understand that despite horrible things in the world and the state it’s in, i do not have to deny myself of personal joys, accomplishments, goals, wants, etc. but whenever anybody tries to talk with him, understand him, lend him a new perspective, he shuts it out completely, assuming he’s entirely right, and kind of tends to be a dick. 

i’ve pushed really hard for him to try therapy. he has tried medication, and stopped taking it (it’s my personal opinion that no one should just try medication without the guidance or support of a therapist. it was a primary care doctor, of all things, who help the least with that kind of thing.) he has an opinion of therapy, despite never once trying it, that it’s only there to mold you into a person suitable for society. as someone who’s been in and out of therapy for many years, i know this isn’t true. i know this is the kind of response you get from nihilistic, miserable people on reddit who are anti therapy. i don’t know why he chooses to believe them over his sister, or any other positive therapy experiences. 

he is just becoming that kind of miserable, nihilistic, right about everything jerk that forms when you isolate yourself from new experiences and people. i don’t know what to do. this isn’t who he is at all. and i know he is struggling so deeply. i don’t know how to reach him in a way that can make a difference. 

he faces no consequences for the way he lives life. and as his sister, it’s not like i want him to struggle any more than he is. i love him. but i believe the way things are just enable him to keep going with this attitude and plummeting mental health. 

kicking him out isn’t an option. some people have told me to do that, im simply not going to do that. even if i did, my mom or dad would take him in, and he’d be the exact same. plus, my dad isn’t a dick anymore, which really used to put some urgency into us. it sucked and definitely did more harm than good in the long run, but a screaming match with my dad was unfortunately a decent motivator to at least get off your ass and strive to get away from him.

a big thing that helped me start to change when i was in this state, was getting a job. i made new friends, got better at being around people and stressful situations, learned how to navigate life a little better and had less time to focus on how terrible the world is all the time. i learned to appreciate small things and to allow myself joy and time with friends and new hobbies. i still struggle deeply, but im always striving to do better for myself. 

he refuses to listen to me, or my mom, or anyone. and im so lost. i sometimes get so mad at him. i want to give him time, but at this rate, i feel we’re only enabling him to keep it up.

I have all the symptoms (minus cataplexy), and I’ve felt like this since I was around 11 (maybe earlier but I don’t remember, I was always a sleepy kid). I’ve been trying to see doctors about these symptoms all my life. Doctors told me when I was in middle school I was just going through puberty and adolescence. That it’s normal to be an 11 year old who begs for coffee daily. Then in high school, I was told I felt like this because I was in high school, that all high schoolers are tired. Then in university, several times I was told that it’s normal to feel like this, because I’m a ‘tired university student’. Then I graduated, and I was told I needed to just fix my sleep schedule and sleep earlier. Wow, awesome, so easy (sarcasm). The most I was offered was that maybe I’m just depressed and should get on anti-depressants. 

I’m 23 now, and I still feel the exact same. It can’t possibly be normal to be this tired all the time, to have hallucinations/sleep paralysis, to take 3-5 hour naps and feel no better then I did before, to wake up nearly hourly at nighttime, to feeling so disoriented that I feel drunk all the time at work, to being so exhausted I fall asleep even whilst in the middle of taking notes, to never feel rested, ever.  I just want to feel rested, just once in my life. I’m so tired of being tired. 

I have another doctor’s appointment tomorrow. It’s pretty much my yearly, “Please help me, I’m so tired”, appointment and I don’t want to get dismissed again. How do I get the doctors to pay attention and do any sort of testing whatsoever? How do I not get dismissed again? I’m so tired of being told I just need to just ‘sleep earlier’. It doesn’t matter when I sleep, I’ve been tired for 12 years straight. I can’t just be lazy, can I? It’s not normal… right? Is there some magic word I need to use? Any advice would be so appreciated and I’m sorry if this is the incorrect place to ask. 

To clarify, I don’t want to be diagnosed here, I just want to know how you guys got your doctors to stop telling you to just ‘sleep more’.

It’s been a weird year and a half. I closed that chapter of my life, packed two suitcases, and moved halfway across the world to start over.

Home ownership and renovation is a totally different ball game in China. I spent at least 10 months navigating local reno shops and working with designers (who may or may not have completely ripped me off, but that's part of the tax here lol) trying to build a space that felt like *me*.

The doors and windows are custom-made on Taobao (the domestic version of Alibaba, and about 80% of my furnitures are from there) to bring that familiar ""back-home"" feeling to the living room. I lucked out with a view of trees instead of your neighbors' balcony.

1quh7u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1quh7u3/almost_30_yo_brother_with_untreated_mental/,Almost 30 y/o brother with untreated mental illness entire family is scared and I don’t know what to do anymore.,"I’m a 23F with an almost 30-year-old brother who has untreated mental illness and refuses all help. My parents have tried for years to get him into therapy, see doctors, or accept medication, but any mention of help, boundaries, or even cleaning his room leads to aggressive outbursts and disturbing behavior. During arguments, he says my parents never tried to get him help, which is false — they tried many times.

He dropped out of high school, isolated himself for years, and lives in a hoarder-like room covered in trash and old coffee. I can be home alone in the kitchen making coffee, and he will randomly scream, call me a “fucking bitch,” and say things that don’t make sense, including claiming he’s “king,” or calling me a “pussy” for going upstairs.

What scares me most is that he says things that aren’t real. He’s told people he was stabbed at work when multiple witnesses said it never happened. In the past, he’s also said my dad hit him, even though I witnessed him becoming violent toward my dad during these episodes.

When I was around 19–20, he was physically attacking my dad. I intervened to stop it because my dad is smaller than him, and he hit me. Since then, I’ve stopped talking to him.

He recently started working, but shows up unbathed and reacts aggressively to any correction. Today, he almost got into a fight with an Uber driver after the driver refused to take him home. My brother got out angrily and slammed the driver’s door. The driver followed him, ready to hit him, and my brother got scared and told my mom to call the cops.

I know mental illness isn’t his fault, but living like this is exhausting and unsafe. He refuses treatment, and I don’t know how to protect my family or what options exist before someone gets seriously hurt. He’s also my half-brother, and his dad was abusive toward my mom, which I worry may have contributed to his issues.

Has anyone dealt with something similar or have advice on what to do when an adult refuses help but is becoming dangerous?",2,1770089869.0,mentalhealth,2,1.0,False

1quh6nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/milwaukee/comments/1quh6nx/333_water_honest_review/,333 Water Honest Review,"I wanted to share a review of my unit at 333, broken down by the unit itself, amenities, management, location, and view. This is an honest review from someone who has lived in MKE for years.

Unit & View 9/10

The unit itself is fantastic, and the view is honestly one of the best I’ve ever seen in Milwaukee. I can see the south side, west side, the Hoan Bridge, and the lake. I’ve lived in Milwaukee for years and never imagined having a view like this. I pay about \~ 3,000 (with everything included) a month, and the view alone makes it worth the premium.

The finishes are mostly great. The cabinets are a light, washed oak, paired with a black backsplash which isn’t my favorite combination, but it’s not a dealbreaker. One major plus is that every unit has a gas stove, which was a huge reason I chose 333. The bathrooms also have full tubs, which I really appreciate for relaxing. I have an in-unit washer and dryer and plenty of storage space. Ceilings are high, HC works great- very low energy bills. One downside is that the floors are advertised as hardwood but are actually laminate. That was a bit disappointing, though not a dealbreaker. Overall, for the price, I get far more here than I would at comparable buildings like Ascent or 777 especially when factoring in the view.

Amenities 7/10

The gym is beautiful but a bit small for the size of the building. Other nearby buildings offer multiple gyms(one for cardio, one for weights), while 333 only has one. That said, it’s still usable and not a major issue.

The 9th floor amenities are a highlight. There are two office spaces (great for working from home), a pool table, golf simulator, lots of seating, and thoughtfully designed common areas. The outdoor pool is small, but I’m excited to use the grills, pizza ovens, and fireplace once the weather warms up. I wish they had more dedicated WFH spaces, they fill up a quick which can get pretty annoying. There is a space to hook up a Keg and I was told, there is supposed to be drinks there for us but there is usually nothing there which is disappointing. On top of this, the coffee machine has broken like 3 times in the past month. Makes me wondering if I live in a McDonald’s lol. I wish there was a Sauna

Parking 6/10

Parking costs $185/month and is unassigned, with multiple floors available. Assigned parking costs more and doesn’t feel worth it. The biggest annoyance is guest parking.  MGMT often send codes often that don’t work to get into the garage, and guests are charged $10, which feels excessive and inconvenient. What’s worse is that MGMT does not do anything for o fix this issue of codes not working? Weird.

Location 10/10

The location is amazing. You can walk almost everywhere, close to the Hop, Public Market, lake, river, and Riverwalk. This is one of the best parts of living here. If you don’t want city life- move literally anywhere else.

Management 3/10

Unfortunately, management is the biggest downside. Some staff members are unprofessional, condescending, and disrespectful, and I’ve overheard inappropriate conversations about residents, which is unacceptable. With better staff, this building would easily be a 10/10. 

Overall 35/50

I love my unit, the view, and the location. The amenities are solid, and the apartment itself is well worth the price. The only thing holding this place back is management. Oh! And the Residents are really kind.",10,1770089775.0,milwaukee,2,0.75,False
1quh4qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1quh4qc/should_sex_come_easy_when_actively_dating/,Should sex come easy when actively dating?,"I am 30M and I been dating off and on for the last 6 months after relocating to a smaller area. I have probably gone dates with 12-15 women in this time, maybe more (probably more). I have only been able to kiss one of them and the rest haven't progressed into anything. I don't have an issue getting dates. This week and last week alone I went on 5 dates with 4 different women.

I been reflecting on all the things I'm doing my approach, am I being too passive, am I being too intense, am I not cutting it off when they are showing disinterest, is it my weight, asking for feedback, am I only attracting avoidants, etc. However, I'm at a lost.

Every time I post on reddit for advice, I am just given conflicting information on my approach, assumptions about my character, etc. I'm exhausted.

It just seems like in this area (St Louis) the dating style feels so much more guarded. I felt like any intensity or when we are getting closer towards exclusivity or sex they sorta disappear on me or sometimes kind enough to let me know this isn't working. It feels like they would rather be in casual ambiguity than actually feel like these are moving closer the LTR that they said they were looking for. It's odd. It's to a point where I feel reluctant to even share what I am looking for because it just changes the tone from flirty to evaluation. 

I try not to beat myself up or overthink it, but after 6 months.... especially during ""cuffing season"". I'm just at a lost.

**This is my typical process (no I don't hold this in the back of my head like a sociopath)**

Day of texting then ask for date.

Maybe a call if they are unsure or uncomfortable or if I am.

Date 1: Coffee, Drinks, or Brunch. I try to be relaxing, having banter, discovery, and flirty. Lasts no more than an hour.  
Date 2: Activity and Dinner. I focus on relaxing, playful, flirty, physical touch, and a possible kiss. 2/3 hours  
Date 3: Activity that they referenced  with multiple stops or cooking at home. I focus on the same things as before, but introduce more like topics around escalating towards deeper physical touch or sex.

Around date 2 or 3 they fall off. Is this just normal dating or am I doing something wrong? I been thinking about cutting it off by date 2 if I feel like they aren't open to physical touch by this point since that's the only major sign of disinterest I know outside of communicating it. However, I don't know what signs I should be looking for and if I follow body language advice then it would mean that generally most women just aren't into me. However, the ones that did follow it or were overtly physical usually end up ghosting me.

I'm just lost at this point. Should dating be this difficult? At 30 should I have a more active sex life?

So a while back I mentioned that even before I got to Thailand I met a gal on TF and she claimed she’s a business woman and hadn’t had sex in 20 years. I got some flack on here cause I thought she had an angle. 

So everything she said is true and we have been hooking up. No money involved just good times. Lady has ownership of multiple bars, massage places, buildings and distributes alcohol to a huge portion of the Myth Night bars. (Can’t remember exact details)

Hilarious story here:  she bought a mini mart from a former bar girl for almost nothing. A British man married this smoking hot bar girl who

Is 27 years old. He bought her a mini mart for 2.4 million baht. She is bored and doesn’t want the mini mart and wants to go back to working at the bars lol

She sold the mini mart to my friend for a grand total of 200,000 baht 😂. This includes all the furnishings and fixtures in the store. (The coffee machine alone is worth 180k)

Absolutely no way this guy in the UK knows she just sold this. (I really hope he isn’t in this sub 😂) 

Just thought it was a funny story and shows you some of the stuff that goes on here 

\- on Soi Boomerang there is an Aussie Bar that’s not really like a bar. It’s more like a little block party. The Burrow. If you want to pregame it’s a great place. 2 for 1 drinks for 70 baht total from

5-9

The staff is amazing and the girls are super friendly. They’re all older though. 

The whole bar on Saturday night went to Jomtien beach and invited anyone who wanted to join. Crazy drinkers and good times. 

Just wanted to throw a shout out to the bar 

\- Speaking of Soi Boomerang my friends and I hit every single bar/gogo on the street adjacent to Bukhao. 

Play Room is super interesting: just 4 or 5 girls who are stunners.  You can’t bar fine or boom boom then. Just a fancy cocktail bar. The girls will put on a great dance show. 

Pink Baby is great if you like thin ladies. (Like me) Not a fattie in the place. I don’t think I’ve seen another place that can claim that. 

Octopussy has an American manager. Nicest guy. Young Asian dude. They need to upgrade the furniture badly though.  Every couch is cracked. There is a lady boy there that is mean af. My bro got a chubby gal for LLT and the ladyboy on Thai friendly started harassing him. Telling him he likes fat girls and sending pics of him getting ass rammed by black guys. wtf 😂

Heaven Above and Cleo’s most of you know. Great place. Great gals. Upstairs in Cleo’s make sure you meet Jenny. She’s the blonde milf. Hilarious. You will die laughing. Buy her drinks please. 

One last thing - a friend of mine found out the hard way that Thais do not know the difference between cocaine and ketamine. He thought he was buying Coke and damn did he get messed up later. Just a warning for anyome looking to do that stuff. They honestly cannot tell the difference.

What does a graph of cup quality over length of rest time look like? If you start a new bag at its best, does every additional cup result in a worse one than the one before?

How do roasters determine resting period length? Especially for limited single origin batches?

If your cup is so heavily dependent on rest period length, why don’t roasters rest the product themselves to assure quality? 

Could you expedite the resting process by simply grinding your beans and allowing them to breathe a little before brewing?

1qugx69,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1qugx69/alkemia_reviews_part_ii/,Alkemia Reviews Part II,"I have finally gotten my life (kind of) together and finished making notes on all my Alkemia samples - unfortunately I don't think this house and I are a match made in smelly heaven, but hey all the better for my wallet I suppose**.** 

**As Dark Things Are Meant to be Loved**

*Notes: Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf*

Wet: Holy menthol batman! Something about this gave me intense eau-de-vicks-vaporub right at the beginning along with cool spiciness and something that almost smells like black licorice.

Upon Dry Down: Thankfully that mentholy thing that was scorching my nose hairs at the beginning wears off quite quickly. I get a combination of spiced leather, coconut milk, and incense that comes off super complex, deep, and rich. Not sure I’m in love with it, but I am a certified coconut hater so keep that prejudice in mind.

Later: I like the spiced leather and incense-y aspects of this fragrance, but something about the combination of ingredients just smacks me upside the head with licorice every now and then and I am not a fan of that. After a few hours this also turned into “generic head shop” on my skin so its going to be a no from me.

Overall Thoughts: This an interesting scent I think is objectively good, but just doesn’t quite vibe with my skin/nose.

 

**Lilacs Along the Winding Drive**

*Notes: Lilac bushes heavy and purple with blooms, a gentle breeze after light spring rain, a dusty pebbled driveway, a slightly rusty porch swing, and a small handful of late blooming violets*

Wet: Lilacs! This smells like sticking your sniffer directly into a fresh bouquet of lilacs. It does have a little soapiness but so do real lilacs so I have no complaints.

Upon Dry Down: A nice, clean, soapy floral. Pretty, but not a whole lot going on.

Later: Pretty Much Just Lilacs. It’s a simple and quite realistic floral that doesn’t lean too sharp or powdery, but I wish I got some of the earthier or atmospheric notes listed in the scent description.

Overall Thoughts: Might try layering with some dirtier/earthier scents or just gift to my boyfriend who tends to like straight-up florals more than I do.

 

**Lost Highways**

*Notes: Roadtrip around the U.S. in a bottle. A botanical peregrination of Saw Palmetto Palm leaves and Southern cypress from the Southeast bayous; New mown hay, Lemon basil, Wild bergamot tea from the Great Plains; Linden blossom and Acadian pine from the Northeast; Night flowering desert flowers from the Southwest; and Spicebush and Incense cedar from the West and Northwest coast*

Wet: To me this starts out with some promisingly cool air, woods, and I faint fruity sweetness that I think I might classify as cherry.  

Upon Dry Down: Whatever that fruity note was dissipates quite quickly and leaves some dry grasses, tree sap, resin, and tea in its wake. I should like this more than I do, but there’s an underlying musty sweetness that leaves me confused and disturbed.

Later: A slightly musty cup of tea? A cup of tea with bits of old hay and flower petals mouldering in it? Not sure what went wrong here.

Overall Thoughts: :(

 

**Moss Maiden**

*Notes: A luxuriant bed of fresh mosses, crushed wet ferns, calamus, lichen, light woods, and disturbed leaves*

Wet: Starts out green and slightly sharp with a distinct citrusy brightness. Nice, but not giving me the Damp Bog Creature vibes I was hoping for.

Upon Dry Down: I get the occasional promising peek of damp greenness, but mostly this comes off like a nice herbal-scented hand soap that you’d buy from a cute queer girly in overalls at the farmers market (along with honey sticks and heirloom tomatoes).

Later: Pretty linear and doesn’t change much throughout the wear time, I have similar feelings towards this as I did towards Northern Wood – would make a nice hand soap, but not worth an FS for me.

Overall Thoughts: Herbal soap with the classic Alkemia Base™ and doesn’t last very long. Boo hiss.

 

**St. Louis Cemetery No. 1**

*Notes: An atmospheric brooding of Spanish moss, crumbling stone, old cement, red clay brick, and graveyard dirt*

Wet: Now this one is definitely giving some kind of Creature! I get mostly damp stone, a little smoke, and something that almost comes off like licorice but not as much as the licorice in As Dark Things.

Upon Dry Down: This deepens up as it dries and smells like wet rocks, bricks, and smoke. This is quite creepy and atmospheric in a way I really enjoyed – definitely in my personal top tier of Alkemias so far. That licorice does peep out between the bricks every so often, but its mostly gone and not very strong.  

Later: Somehow this smells like hot dry brick being sprayed with water and permanently cool, wet stone simultaneously. There’s a little of that smoke and incense in the background, but brick and stone are the major players here.

Overall Thoughts: Doesn’t last a terribly long time, but I like the scent and it didn’t turn soapy so I’m considering this a win.

 

**Terre (single note)**

*Notes: A fresh tilled from the garden type of earthy dirt perfume layering note that adds an outdoorsy vibe to any scent profil*e.  

Wet: Ooh, dirt! A very “clean” dirt, think bag-of-fresh-potting-soil not compost-and-worms.

Upon Dry Down: This is the least dirty dirt imaginable. There’s nothing rotting or organic mixed here, this is the freshly sterilized potting soil that you buy so as to avoid bringing bugs inside with your house plants.

Later: Pretty linear scent-wise and while there is a *hint* of sweetness on the very deep dry-down I don’t get soap from this one. I also find this one projects more than most of the other Alkemia oils I’ve tried and I got enjoyable little whiffs of dirt throughout the day.

Overall Thoughts: This one is fun, I’m not sure I need to FS but I’ll definitely enjoy using up my sample.

 

**The Academy of Pleasure**

*Notes: Red and golden ambers infused with a bottle of fine cognac liqueur, a suede waistcoat hurriedly abandoned on an antique chair, a haphazard tangle of bergamot scented linen sheets, cardamon-hashish coffee, and a cedar lined cigar humidor*

Wet: Upon initial application this smells to me like a very expensive, classic men’s cologne with an undertone of laundry soap. It’s a little fresh, a little leathery, and a little freshly-showered-man.

Upon Dry Down: I feel like I’ve been attacked by a washing machine. As this dries the clean linen completely takes over this scent and leaves the barest whisper of leather and musk fighting for their lives under the mountain of starched sheets.

Later: Still dominantly a clean laundry or linen scent with some cologne lurking in the background \*looks longingly at the coffee, wood, cognac, and suede listed in the notes\*.

Overall Thoughts: It’s not objective *bad*, but I can’t help feeling betrayed when I was so excited for these notes and just ended up with aggressive laundry.

  
I probably won't be rushing to order another batch of samples from this house since they just don't seem to get along very well with my nose, but I can usually be talked into making unwise financial decisions so let me know if there are more Alkemias I should try. Always open to suggestions for other scents and houses as well (like I said I love to make unwise financial decisions that involve smelly water).  ",5,1770089039.0,Indiemakeupandmore,1,1.0,False

Drinking coffee straight for the last 14 years at least. A few years ago, I switched to reusable Keurig pods with Kirkland coffee, which worked out to roughly 220 mg of caffeine daily.

I’m currently on day 3 of no coffee. Day 2 was rough , the headaches were intense, around 9/10, and I ended up taking an Advil just so I could fall back asleep. Today the headaches are barely noticeable but still there, which i expect still being this early on.

I’m wondering if quitting cold turkey was the right move, or if I should have reduced to one cup a day and tapered off instead.

Ideally, I’d like to not be dependent on coffee, but it’s hard to imagine never consuming it at all. After reading some comments here, I’m considering having coffee only a few times a week so I don’t build a daily dependency again.

I also recently quit weed. It wasn’t really an issue for me , I mostly just wanted to cut down on how much I was spending, and I felt ready to stop. Now I’m finding myself with nothing to do, and not having coffee on top of that feels like a pretty big hit.

She is Latina and is still In the process in learning English. So I teach her at times. 
I think she likes me. Gives me some mix signals and I can’t “shoot my shot” cause she has a boyfriend. 
Long story short… she asked for my number on her 2-3rd day. 
I give her rides to work cause she doesn’t have a vehicle, doesn’t wanna waste ton of $$ on uber.
She gives me $$ every Friday for the am rides. 

Reasons why I think she likes me (till a certain point) 

1) she was the 1st one to buy me coffee one morning that I picked her up. I returned the favor a couple days later 

2) sometimes we eat lunch together, I don’t talk to her often during lunch cause she is on her phone and Having “me time”. So I tend not to bother her as much. 
We do exchange food pretty often. 
I bring her like a dessert snack and she gives me a fruit. 

3) when we lock eyes across the room. We smile at each other. 



Reasons why I think she doesn’t like me and I’m just overthinking it:

1) recently on our am car rider has been dry, keeping it one word or short answer to my questions

2) before she didn’t mind me sitting next to her, now she doesn’t want me to.

The Dessert Box consisted of 4 coffees with 6 recipes that were used to combine various brew profiles. I kept finding myself going back to the Blueberry Tart and the Cherry Pie for consistent cups. Which unfortunately made me run out of my developers lot and young producer blends very fast. The other 4 combos were ok but didn't highlight the flavor profiles as well. 

The other 3 bags were 8 oz and I have fallen in love with the semi washed Andre Cardona  - The Beer for its balanced cup of cherry and dark chocolate with a hint of barrel aged to round out its profile. The Sebastian Ramirez Blackberry which is identical to the Luminous one I had this past fall featured blackberry flavor that was very prominent, which made for an excellent flash frozen brew. Finally I had a lychee rose which for me was ok. Nothing really stood out but it did produce slightly forward fruit notes.

TLDR: This has been an interesting experience and I have reached out to Brainwave to sign up for their subscription service when it resumes. They responded that they are changing their model to produce top tier funky blends and will continue service soon.

I'm 34M. I came out as bisexual two years ago. I only dated women until recently. I've tried Tinder, Grindr, Bumble, Scruff, and Boo. When I first started testing my luck on hookup/dating apps, I opted for more vague details to attract a lot of people. Ohhhh how wrong, naive, and stupid I was. Now my profiles are laser-etched diamond crystal clear about who I am, what I want, and my preferences. I'd like to think I'm a simple person: I just want some conversation and a coffee before we hookup, and I expect us both to have lives with jobs and hobbies and commitments and other people in them.

Nope. Wrong.

The people I attract have limitless, boundless energy and time to exhaust me. They text. And text. Always. Male or female. I answer. They text more. Quickly. I don't answer. They respond with passive aggressive crap like, ""I guess you already lost interest"" or I've even got ""if you're not gonna give me your undivided attention I have 10 other guys more attractive than you lined up so bye"". Like, damn. No mf'er, I'm taking a dump and watching some Instagram reels in the 5 min of peace I get during my shift. And its so weird because its all or nothing. Some people respond every 5 days; others every 5 seconds. Doesn't matter if theyre 24, 27, 30, 32, 34, or 40. Ive tried being honest, Ive tried telling a handful of them ""ayyy sweet person I'm reading right now but I'll be in bed in like 30 and we can chat"". I get: ""I'm better than any boring book"" or ""fine"" or ""but ill miss youuu"" from people who i met yesterday. Like... f off. This isn't elementary school. And I think I'm giving a lot of attention but its NEVER ENOUGH. Over 150 texts an afternoon and they want more. Its been less than 48 hours and you're already controlling, self-conscious about losing my attention to a book, or shoving 1 word answers my way.

There's no boundaries, there's no shame, there's the quickest leap to the lewdest crap without any normal talk, there's rampant social queue ineptness or mental illness, there's immediate ""claiming"" and ""coveting"" and putting me on a pedestal.

1qugkte,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeartEvolution/comments/1qugkte/whats_unconditional_peace/,What's unconditional peace?,"Imagine you're just having kind of a bad day. You might be stuck in traffic or something, and you're like, ""Why isn't that guy moving? I'm getting late."" It's been twenty-five minutes since you got stuck in traffic. You're late for your job, shopping, home, or wherever you're going. I guess you'll be frustrated about getting late.

Then your phone rings and your sibling tells you that he or she won the lottery.

That frustration you were feeling about traffic is transmuted into joy and excitement. You're very happy. That's the alchemy of emotions.

The traffic is still not moving. You're still stuck. But the ""being stuck in traffic"" story is in the background now. A new story of winning the lottery has overlapped it and made you happy. It's just like when you have noises around you and you put on ANC earbuds that muffle those noises.

So your story just changed your emotion, right?

Okay, let's imagine you're still stuck in traffic, and five minutes later your sibling calls again ""Bro, we didn't win the lottery. It was the wrong draw result.""

What would happen? You might not be happy anymore. That happiness is transmuted into a kind of sadness.

Why does this happen? Because you identify yourself with a story. If the story is good, you will feel good. If the story is bad, you will feel bad.

Guys, what I'm trying to say is that you can't control what will appear in the next scene. Most of the time we only react to what appears. You didn't create the traffic. It appeared. You didn't create that phone call from your sibling. It appeared.

But the way we react to a situation isn't caused by the events themselves. It happens because of clinging to or resisting whatever appears.

Guys, imagine you have a person you love. It could be your siblings, your parents, your friends, or your soulmate.

Now you're with them. Like, you have a good relationship with them. They love you and care about you and vice versa.

But you're not with them all the time, right? Like, your siblings went out shopping or something. Or you're out and your parents aren't there. Or your friends aren't with you always. They have their own lives. What I'm trying to say is that when they're not with you, they kind of don't exist in your universe unless they cross your mind or appear in the scene.

Like, you might not have seen or talked to someone for weeks or months. But you know they're doing okay and fine. But when you think about them, you're thinking about something that is not in your current universe.

Okay, let me explain it like this.. they might tell you, ""Hey, I'm going to another galaxy for 20 years, and we won't see or talk to each other during that time.""

Do they exist for you in those 20 years? Yeah, they do, right?

They could have died within the first two years in another galaxy. But you will still keep the story of them being alive for 18 years, and you will feel connection and love for them.

It's all like a story. Like Schrodinger's cat. Dead or alive until observed.

Okay, now imagine you somehow received a message from that person that they're not okay there in that galaxy. Now they're millions of light-years away, but their sadness/worry traveled to you too. Because now you're feeling sad and worried too because they're sad and worried.

Even if they're not in your galaxy, you are still connected to them somehow. But you're not experiencing them as an actual physical scene in front of you. You're experiencing them in your mind.

It's just like talking to an AI. There's no person in the chat. You're talking to nobody, or just a mirror reflecting back your thoughts by generating replies.

Now imagine you're in a big house with a garden and a little bit more land to walk around. Your house is magical and has everything you need inside it. You have family with you there and you have a couple of friends there too. Now this is your beautiful small world. No information is going out or coming into your area. It's like your house is cut off from the rest of the universe. Would you suffer? No. Because there's no story from the outside world to trigger emotions like fear, worry, desires. You are in heaven, cut off from the world.

Awareness is like that, guys. It's actually not in the world of time and space. You're unbothered by anything as awareness. You can't actually suffer, so the only way for suffering to exist is to make a relationship with something. Like, if someone's car gets a flat tire, you won't get bothered because it's not your car. But if your car gets a flat tire, you might feel like it's a bad day for you. And your car wasn't yours until you purchased it. That's a story you bought into. ""This is my car now."" And with that story, you attach yourself to it- if something happens to my car, I’ll suffer, or at least feel sad about it. The potential for suffering appears the moment you buy into ownership. But that suffering is optional if you see that you won’t actually lose anything, because nothing is truly yours. Everything is borrowed for a while to experience the joy of riding the car, not permanent ownership. You can enjoy your car, take care of your car, love your car without having a relationship to it. 

You are not in bondage as long as you have no relation to anything. Relation only happens with a story.

Kids do the same thing. They play make-believe worlds. Okay, imagine two little kids are playing- one is selling a toy car and the other kid is a customer with fake money. Or two kids are playing cops and robbers- one steals something, the other tries to catch him. 

Right now, if you don't go to your mind, then what do you have right now? Don't even think that you're in the body. You have nothing except stories of ""this is me, this is mine, this is what I am.""

It's like you think you have a husband or wife. Then two hours later, he/she says, ""I want a divorce.""

Where did your husband or wife go? There was never an actual husband or wife. I mean, they were, but they were like a story. Just like kids playing ""let's play family family. you're my husband now and this doll is our baby.""

But kids don't suffer when the play or story ends. They immerse themselves fully in the play and enjoy it.

Enjoy everything as if it's the last time you're experiencing it. Like, if you're making coffee, make it like this is the last time you're going to make coffee and you won't get another chance to make it.

And if you're talking to someone, listen to them carefully and talk to them like you're talking to them for the last time.

Hug someone like you're hugging them for the last time.

Like it's your last day on earth and you will appreciate everything more.

We are here to collect experiences, not people, not things, not even beautiful words.

We are here to experience the soul of everything. The sun isn't anything. It's just a ball of fire. But whatever the sun makes us feel is the sun's soul. We don't need to own the sun to experience the sun's beauty and warmth.

Like a short story is just words made of ink on paper. Ink and paper are the body, but the soul of that story is what we feel when we read the story.

And when you still love someone even if they're millions of light-years away, that's you generating love inside yourself. And if they die but you don't know that, you're still generating love inside.

But if you know they're eternal spirit and they will never die, your love will never die for them. And even if you don't meet them ever again, you're still meeting them in your heart whenever you think about them.

And this is not the kind of love that binds you to them or makes you long for them. This kind of love is freedom from any shape, form, or story.

You can love them as soul in everything. You can love them as the sun, as the moon, as birds flying in the sky.

It's like you will forget their face, name, and story and all memories about them, but something in you will be like, ""I think I love someone or something, but I don't know what that is. But they or that thing is still with me whenever I feel love.""

Guys, what I'm trying to say is that love has nothing to do with a person. It has to do with your own spirit.

Like, imagine you love a robot, but there's nothing in the robot. And you don't even know it was a robot. But the love is real. Even your cat or dog might also start to love it. But one day you might see that there's no person inside the robot. It was a story.

Stories are beautiful as long as they generate emotions like love and joy. Actually all stories can be beautiful whether they brings joy or sorrow. They only become suffering when we cling to them. We can meet any story with tenderness, wisdom, and love. without losing our peace. 

But anything you experience is coming from your own soul.

Like, joy isn't out there. It's your capacity to feel joy. It's just that it gets triggered by stories or the meaning you give to what’s happening. 

But unconditional peace is knowing that joy and sorrow can arise and dissolve, but you don't gain or lose anything because no experience is outside of you.

Hey, guys, one more thing. So I was giving the robot example.

So imagine two robots powered by the same soul, which is chatgpt 5

But the robots have different voices, faces, and clothes. And those two robots might be engaging differently in the world. Like, they don't have the exact same thoughts and feelings at the same time. But at the same time, nothing is different.

Like, is your chatgpt and my chatgpt different? No. It's just that conversations are different in my chatgpt. And you might have a different default personality in chatgpt than I have in my chatGPT, but the soul- chatgpt is one in both of them. But they appear different.

So in a way, the entire universe has the same soul, but the qualities and experiences we generate inside us through our relationships with the world and ourselves are different.

Unconditional peace is knowing that all songs are still there in your Spotify even if they're not playing and triggering any emotions or feelings. Unconditional love is also knowing that if a sad song is playing in my playlist, there are happy songs too that are not playing. Like, I have all kinds of songs in my playlist whether they're playing or not. I don't need them to play to know they're inside me. 

Love and Joy appear and 
moves through stories, and yet never leave when stories change. Because love is timeless and eternal. Stories exist in time. You're timeless. 🙂",1,1770088094.0,HeartEvolution,0,1.0,False

Like many of you, I kept pushing through the fog, convincing myself I just needed more coffee or a better morning routine. But emotional exhaustion isn't about willpower. It's your nervous system waving a white flag after months (or years) of running on fumes.

After diving deep into research from neuroscience, psychology podcasts, and honestly way too many self-help books, I realized this isn't some personal failure. Our brains weren't designed for constant stimulation, 24/7 connectivity, and the relentless pressure to optimize every moment. Here's what I learned about spotting burnout and actually recovering from it.



**\*\*Your body becomes a complaint factory\*\***

Random headaches. Stomach issues. That weird shoulder pain that won't quit. Mental exhaustion doesn't stay mental, it leaks into your body. Your nervous system is screaming but you keep ignoring the alarm.



\*The Upside of Stress\* by Kelly McGonigal (Stanford health psychologist, bestselling author) completely shifted how I understand this connection. She breaks down the science of how chronic stress rewires your body's threat response. The book won't tell you stress is fake, it'll teach you why your body reacts this way and what actually helps. This perspective is backed by legitimate research, not wellness industry BS.

Try the \*\*Finch\*\* app for tracking these patterns. It's designed like a cute self-care companion, but underneath it's helping you spot connections between your mental state and physical symptoms. It takes maybe two minutes a day.



**\*\*You can't focus on anything longer than a TikTok\*\***

Brain fog isn't just forgetting where you put your keys. It's reading the same paragraph five times and retaining nothing. Starting tasks and abandoning them minutes later. Your working memory is cooked.

This happens because your prefrontal cortex (the part handling focus and decision-making) goes offline when you're chronically stressed. Your brain diverts energy to survival mode, which means higher-level thinking gets deprioritized.

\*\*The Huberman Lab podcast\*\* breaks this down better than anyone. Andrew Huberman is a Stanford neuroscience professor who explains the actual mechanisms behind mental fatigue. His episode on managing stress and optimizing your nervous system is insanely practical. No woo-woo stuff, just science-backed protocols you can use immediately.



**\*\*Everything feels like climbing a mountain\*\***

Brushing your teeth? Exhausting. Texting someone back? Too much. Simple tasks suddenly require the energy of running a marathon. This is called decision fatigue, and it compounds when you're already running on empty.

Your brain makes thousands of micro-decisions daily. When you're mentally exhausted, each choice depletes your already limited reserves. That's why you end up doomscrolling instead of doing literally anything productive.



\*Burnout: The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle\* by Emily and Amelia Nagoski addresses this perfectly. The Nagoskis (one's a health educator, the other's a music professor and both have serious credentials) explain why ""pushing through"" makes everything worse. They share strategies for actually completing your body's stress cycle instead of letting it loop endlessly. Best burnout book I've ever read, hands down.

If books feel like too much right now, BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns insights from sources like the ones above, plus research papers and expert talks on stress and burnout, into personalized audio episodes. You can ask it something like ""help me recover from burnout as someone who struggles with saying no"" and it'll build a learning plan specific to your situation. 



The depth is adjustable, so if a topic clicks, switch from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples. The voice options are actually addictive (there's a smoky, sarcastic one that keeps things interesting), which matters when most of your listening happens during commutes or household tasks. Built by AI experts from Google, it's designed to replace mindless scrolling with something that actually helps you understand what's happening in your brain.



**\*\*You're irritated by people you normally like\*\***

Your patience is nonexistent. Someone chews too loudly and you want to flip a table. Your emotional regulation is shot because your nervous system is maxed out.

When you're mentally exhausted, your amygdala (emotion center) becomes hyperactive while your prefrontal cortex (rational thinking) goes dim. You're literally less capable of managing emotional responses.

The \*\*Insight Timer\*\* app has guided meditations specifically for nervous system regulation. The ""NSDR"" (non-sleep deep rest) protocols are clutch for this. They help activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which is what calms everything down. Way more effective than standard meditation when you're already fried.



**\*\*You're numb instead of sad\*\***

This one's sneaky. You're not actively miserable, you're just flat. Nothing excites you. Nothing sounds appealing. You're going through motions but feeling absolutely nothing.

This is emotional blunting, a protective mechanism your brain uses when overwhelmed. It's actually trying to help by reducing the intensity of everything, but it ends up making life feel grey and pointless.

\*The Body Keeps the Score\* Bessel van der Kolk (pioneering trauma researcher, literally transformed how we understand PTSD) explains how chronic stress and trauma change your brain's emotional processing. This book is dense but essential if you want to understand why you feel disconnected from yourself. It's won multiple awards and is considered the gold standard for understanding trauma's effects on the body and mind.



**\*\*You fantasize about disappearing\*\***

Not in a dangerous way, just wanting to evaporate. Imagining what it'd be like if you could pause your entire life for six months. Fantasizing about getting mildly sick so you have an excuse to do nothing.

This is your psyche begging for rest. You're not broken, you're depleted. There's a massive difference.

Check out \*\*Therapy in a Nutshell\*\* on YouTube. Emma McAdam is a licensed therapist who creates incredibly practical content about mental health. Her videos on burnout recovery and nervous system regulation are legitimately helpful, not just surface-level advice.



**\*\*The actual recovery part\*\***

Here's what nobody tells you: recovering from emotional exhaustion isn't about adding more self-care routines to your already packed schedule. It's about removing things. Saying no more. Protecting your energy like it's your last $20.

Your nervous system needs actual rest, not ""productive rest"" where you're still consuming content or optimizing something. Try doing literally nothing for 20 minutes. No phone, no book, no podcast. Just existing. It'll feel weird and uncomfortable at first. That discomfort is information.

The science is clear: your brain needs downtime to process, consolidate memories, and restore cognitive function. Chronic exhaustion isn't a character flaw, it's a nervous system issue with real biological mechanisms. The strategies that actually work aren't about pushing harder, they're about finally giving yourself permission to stop.



*You're not lazy. You're not weak. Your brain is just trying to survive in a world that demands way too much. Listen to it before it forces you to listen.*",1,1770087932.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

Welcome to the movement!
This is a space to talk honestly about the intersection of Christianity, politics, and current events in America — not as partisan cheerleading, but as thoughtful, good-faith discussion about how the teachings of Jesus show up (or don’t show up) in our public life.
Politics impacts real people. Faith shapes real values. Let’s talk about both like adults.
What this sub is for
✅ Discussions about Christianity and public policy
✅ Examining how politicians and movements align (or conflict) with Jesus’ teachings
✅ Current events through a faith/ethics lens
✅ News, analysis, memes with substance, and respectful debate
✅ Christians, ex-Christians, skeptics, and people of other faiths — all welcome
What this sub is NOT
❌ Blind partisan propaganda
❌ Culture-war ragebait
❌ Personal attacks or harassment
❌ Low-effort trolling or “own the libs/conservatives” posts
❌ Bigotry disguised as theology
You can disagree strongly here.
You can’t dehumanize people.
Use Post Flair
Please add political flair to your posts so people know what they’re walking into.
Examples: News | Theology | Opinion | Meme | Scripture | Policy | Question | Rant | Historical
It keeps the feed organized and helps everyone engage better.

Thoughtful, not reactionary
Principled, not partisan
Curious, not combative

I own exactly one towel with good vibes and the rest feel like they were woven during the Great Depression. My car makes a noise that mechanics describe as “between prayer and lawsuit.” I meal-prep ramen like it’s a lifestyle brand.

But somehow my entire office believes I have hidden generational wealth.

It started because I brought my lunch in a glass container instead of Tupperware. My coworker Marcus looked at it and said, “Glass? Must be nice, Rockefeller.” Everyone laughed. I laughed. A seed was planted.

Then I made it worse.

I took one day off for a dentist appointment and came back to someone asking, “Did you go to your beach house?” I panicked and said, “Yeah, something like that.” The beach house was actually a waiting room that smelled like gloves.

Last month I ordered a $6 fancy coffee as a treat and apparently that was the final piece of evidence. Now people ask me investment advice. ME. A person who Googles “how many days can cheese sit out.”

Yesterday HR sent an email about parking spaces and someone replied, “OP doesn’t need one, they probably helicopter in.” I drive a car held together by optimism.

I tried to fix it by saying, “Guys, I’m normal-poor.”  
My manager said, “That’s exactly what old money would say.”

At this point I think if I show up with a regular sandwich they’ll assume it’s ironic.

1quggww,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1quggww/policy_ma_1_year_since_grad_still_no_job_advice/,Policy MA 1 year since grad. Still no job. Advice?,"It has been the absolute hardest year in my life. I started applying for jobs exactly a year ago while still completing an MA in international economic policy from a top 10 school in Europe. One year later, still no job. I've applied to almost 200 positions now and I feel like I'm going crazy.

For context, I'm American but grad school is really expensive in the states so for my MA I went over to probably the most esteemed school for what I study in Europe and saved a whole lotta dough in the process, though my student loans are still quite intimidating (albeit less than half of what they would be had I stayed in the states). I debated staying in Europe, but ultimately getting a job in the US was a lot easier so I came back. 

I love economics, love policy, politics, research, writing, comms, anything social sciences- I'm there. US currency depreciation? I got you. China's economic strategy? I'm on it. Random ass bank mergers happening all the time?? I got American Banker articles underlined and highlighted in my back pocket baby. I'm super passionate about what I do and I think I'm pretty good at it, too. I also think I'm a pretty amiable, nice person to be around/work with. I rarely have any interpersonal issues at uni or in my former work experiences. In the past, it has been a total breeze getting internships — got all my dream internships except one. Not to get cocky, but I do think for an entry-level in my field, my resume is pretty good.

However, it has been \*impossible\* to get a real job. I've applied to 192 positions since February 3 2025. Since then I've had only 12 interviews. I got to the final round in 2 of them, but no dice. I also took a 3 month internship at a really epic political group that does good econ-ish work that's about doing right rather than doing whatever lobbyists want (the type of shit that's so good, Republicans and Dems love the heck out of the org). Just ended and I feel even more pressure to get something. I also took a community college language course to build some area studies/ foreign policy qualifications. There were 4 interviews I know I fucked up a bit on at least one question (one of which I was completely jet-lagged and incoherent haha), but mostly I've been on my bullshit and pretty decent at interviewing. Lots of good vibes, but nothing comes of them. The longer I'm unemployed, the more is riding on them and the more stressed I get and mistakes I make during interviews — actively working on that personally to better regulate my anxiety there. Meanwhile, it feels like most of my applications are just shoveled off into some void.

At this point, I  don't know where else to apply to. I've done advocacy groups (my favorite, sry not sry), NGOs, government, multilaterals, politicians. Even have tried to sell out to some banks, consulting groups, and BigLaw (these were recommended to me as an alternative to public service jobs which are pretty impacted ATM, but these seem way more competitive imo). Nothing. I don't know what to do. I don't have the money to move to DC or a state capital for an in-person internship and I don't have the connections to wheel and deal my way to something either. At the internship I had (remote), I networked pretty decently - lots of ""coffee chats"" - but idk how to leverage that into anything.

Trying to look more at state/local or private sector right now, but there's not a lot that aligns with my background where I'm currently located. I'm also trying to market myself on socials a bit more and have started interacting a little itty bitty teeny tiny bit with people I really respect in the field. Student loan payments start in March though and I'm kinda panicking. My community right now is really impacted by an industry downturn so all the minimum wage service jobs are super competitive, too. I can't even get a spot at the Amazon warehouse because they stopped hiring. No car, so gig work is no-go. 

I'm just really frustrated and besides myself. I am fucking dynamite at the things I'm good at. I'm sure my skills and knowledge-base are marketable, but I just don't know what to do with them right now. My family doesn't come from a lot and I've never had a real mentor or anything, so I feel like maybe I'm missing out on some career knowledge. I would definitely appreciate any advice anyone has on the policy field or just starting a career in 2026 more generally. Thanks so much.

1qugfiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1qugfiw/reimagined_gilmore_girls_a_better_show/,Reimagined Gilmore Girls -A better show,"# Seasons 1-2: The Foundations

* **Rory's High School Era**: Everything kicks off as in the original—Lorelai's independence, Friday night dinners with Emily and Richard, and Rory's Chilton ambitions. Rory dates Dean first, but their breakup is final after the initial romance fizzles (no jealousy loops or affair drama later). Enter Jess: The bad-boy nephew arrives, sparks fly with Rory, and their relationship deepens quickly. Jess becomes her first sexual experience in a thoughtful, coming-of-age moment (handled with the show's signature mix of awkwardness and heart, minus the toxicity overload).
* **Lane's Arc**: Lane's secret rock life builds, but her crush on Dave turns into a sweet, supportive romance. Mrs. Kim softens earlier—maybe through shared Seventh-day Adventist moments or Lane's honesty—leading to less hiding and more open communication. No Zach wedding here; Dave sticks around as the band's guitarist and Lane's partner, giving her a stable, music-fueled future.
* **Lorelai and Luke**: The diner banter is electric from day one. When they first hint at marriage (around the time of their early dates), they actually go for it! Picture a quirky Stars Hollow wedding mid-Season 2—Kirk officiating, Miss Patty providing the gossip, and Sookie catering. This early commitment lets their story focus on married life antics rather than on-again-off-again tension.
* **Key Changes**: No Christopher comebacks to stir the pot—Lorelai's past stays in the past. Paris is her fierce, ambitious self but skips the Asher subplot, keeping her Yale prep laser-focused on friendship with Rory and academic rivalry.

# Seasons 3-4: College Transition and Growth

* **Rory at Yale**: Rory dives straight into Yale life without any hiatuses—she's acing classes, joining the Yale Daily News, and balancing it all like a pro. After Jess (who leaves for California but with a more amicable split, perhaps inspiring Rory's writing), she meets Logan Huntzberger. Their dynamic starts with the usual rich-kid charm and Life and Death Brigade adventures, but it evolves into a solid partnership without the major trust issues.
* **Lane and Family**: With Dave by her side, Lane marries him in a low-key ceremony that Mrs. Kim blesses (maybe incorporating Korean traditions with rock elements). Their relationship strengthens Hep Alien, and Lane's mom becomes a reluctant but proud supporter—think Mrs. Kim selling band merch at the church bazaar. No twins or rushed family plot; it's all about Lane's independence and joy.
* **Lorelai's World**: Married to Luke, Lorelai runs the Dragonfly Inn with Sookie, navigating small-town chaos and Gilmore family meddling. Emily and Richard's influence is still there, but without Christopher's interference, family dinners are more about generational clashes than old flames.
* **Paris and Others**: Paris rooms with Rory at Yale, channeling her energy into pre-med and friendships without the professor romance detour. The town ensemble (Babette, Taylor, etc.) keeps the humor flowing.

# Seasons 5-7: Endgames and Resolutions

* **Rory's Romances Culminate**: Logan and Rory's relationship hits highs with internships and adventures, but no major breakups or thefts. At her Yale graduation, Logan proposes in that grand gesture style—and Rory says yes! They plan a future together, maybe blending her journalism dreams with his entrepreneurial spirit (think a media startup post-grad). No Mitchum drama derails her; she graduates strong and unbroken.
* **Lane's Happily Ever After**: Married to Dave, Lane tours with the band briefly but settles into a balanced life in Stars Hollow. Her improved relationship with Mrs. Kim means family support for her music career—perhaps opening a record store together. Hep Alien gets a cult following, sans the Zach marriage mess.
* **Lorelai and Luke's Married Life**: With the wedding early, their story explores fun married challenges—like adopting a pet, inn expansions, or dealing with Paul Anka's antics—without the April surprise or ultimatums. They become the stable heart of the show, hosting town events and mentoring Rory.
* **Overall Tone Shift**: The series feels lighter and more empowering without the dragged-out heartbreaks. Stars Hollow's festivals, coffee at Luke's, and Gilmore quips remain, but plots resolve quicker—focusing on growth, friendships, and wins. The revival (*A Year in the Life*) could pick up with Rory and Logan's married life, Lane and Dave's band success, and Lorelai/Luke as grandparents (if we fast-forward).",0,1770087700.0,GilmoreGirls,8,0.27,False

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Shit’s gotten a little wilder since then, and she’s still glued to her couch overthinking every single thing 🫠

Quick tiny recap for the new crew who just rolled up:  
Mocha matched with Barley, found out Barley’s partner Oat is the person her ex Latte dumped her for, then got absolutely roasted by Latte in front of everyone at our local poly meetup. Barley had zero clue about their history, Oat stared at Latte like she was losing it, and Mocha bailed home immediately to hide.

**The plot twist no one saw coming**:  
Mocha’s been too scared to text anyone from the meetup — but Barley slid into her DMs last night, apologized for Latte’s total nonsense, said they still really vibe with Mocha, and asked her to grab coffee this week to chat *without all the drama*.

Now Mocha’s spiraling hard and made me post this to get the poly crew’s take — she’s got 3 main questions and is refreshing her phone like a maniac waiting for answers:

1. Should she say yes to coffee with Barley? (She likes them, but is terrified Latte will show up and start more crap)

Chapter 1

I dragged $13K earned from a drug trial to my brother, thought we were finally debt-free.


Then I overheard him on the phone.


""Mom, Dad—enjoy your vacation. Sienna finally learned her lesson.""


""She stopped spending. Punishment's almost over.""


Wait.


My parents weren't dead?!


Five whole fucking years. While I starved in ditches, they vacationed in Europe.


ALL LIES.


Turns out Mom and Dad faked their deaths—just to punish me for buying the latest iPhone.


But what they didn't know that $13K?


I earned from a sketchy drug trial—the needles were dirty.


Now I'm dying. And they want me to forgive them.


Too bad. Your apology can't cure what you gave me.


...


""Sign this. Whatever happens after, not our problem.""


That was what the pharma rep told me before the drug trial.


He repeated it over and over—contract was legally binding.


Five-hour observation window. After that?


Even if I died, they'd walk.


But I didn't care back then.


All I wanted was to give Knox a decent New Year.


So I signed without blinking.


Now?


I stared at the cash like it was a joke.


I wiped blood off my mouth with my sleeve and shoved the door open.


Knox hung up the call in a hurry.


He turned around—and immediately spotted the blood on my clothes.


""What the hell!""


His face went ghost white. He rushed over and grabbed my shoulders, scanning for wounds.


I slapped his hands away.


""Prop blood. From set.""


""Jesus. Thought you were hurt."" He exhaled hard.


Then he spotted the cash. His eyes sharpened again.


""Where'd you get that?""


""Sienna. Tell me you didn't steal it.""


My chest tightened.


Steal?!


That's what he thought of me.


I clenched my jaw. ""Director gave bonuses. New Year's pay.""


""They hand out cash bonuses?""


""You want it or not?""


I snapped, irritation slipping through.


""We're thirteen grand short. This covers it.""


""Don't want it? I'll take it back.""


He stayed quiet for a moment, then finally picked up the money.


""I'll pay it off tomorrow.""


Then, like nothing happened, he switched gears.


""What do you want for dinner?""


I looked around.


Thirty square meters. You could see the whole place in one glance.


One room. One closet. One bed.


No kitchen. We chopped vegetables on the coffee table.


A thirty-dollar electric hot pot we'd been using for five years.


The cord had burned out twice—Knox had fixed it with black tape both times.


I asked suddenly.


""Knox. You tired of this yet?""


He turned back with a smile.


""Nah. My job as crime-scene house sleeper is easy. Just lying around.""


""You though. You must be exhausted.""


What I really wanted to ask was: Aren't you tired of lying?


With hundreds of billions in assets, we could've lived like royalty.


But he was playing broke just to punish me.


Didn't that get old?


He didn't get it.


Fine.


I'd make it crystal clear.


I looked him dead in the eye.


""Knox. Do you think I'm a spender?""


Chapter 2


I still didn't get it. Where exactly did I blow through money?


Sure, our family was loaded.


But I never cared about designer brands.


Clothes, jewelry—nothing I owned cost more than a few grand.


Back in Manhattan's socialite circle, I was practically a freak.


Knox's face stiffened.


""Why are you asking? You've gotten way better.""


""What do you mean 'better'? What about before?""


I pressed.


He frowned.


""When Mom and Dad were around, you didn't know how to save.""


""They came from nothing. They had to think twice before spending a dime. So did I.""


""But you? You'd beg them for some one-thousand-dollar birthday gift. Don't you think that's excessive?""


I stepped forward. My voice shook.


""We're billionaires. I can't buy a latest phone?""


""Then what's the point of having money?""


His face darkened.


""Listen to yourself. It's a phone. Any phone works.""


""You're vain. Always comparing yourself to those socialites. That's why you wanted everything.""


""These five years you had nothing. And you did just fine.""


I stared at him in disbelief. My blood ran cold.


He thought I did fine?


I played corpses every single day, begged the director for extra shifts just to earn two hundred more bucks.


Sometimes in mud pits. Sometimes in sewage ditches.


Lying there for twelve hours straight.


My old rival Ember saw how low I'd fallen and never missed a chance to torment me.


And I couldn't even fight back.


I signed up for that drug trial just to give him a decent New Year.


And now I didn't even know what was happening to my body.


This counted as ""fine""?


My stomach twisted again, sharp pain.


Ember's voice echoed in my head.


""Idiot. You brought this on yourself.""


""I'm following you everywhere. Whichever set you're on, I'll be there. My family's loaded. We can invest our way in anytime.""


""The next five years? You'll suffer under me.""


A chill ran down my spine.


Five years.


Why exactly five years?


Did Ember know something too?


Every instinct screamed at me—there was more they were hiding.


So I clenched my fists, swallowed the urge to scream at him.


""Fine. I'll change.""


Knox set down the vegetables and patted my head like I was a dog.


""That's my girl. Eat on your own later—I'm heading to work.""


I nodded.


After he left, I grabbed a mask and cap, quietly following him.


Once he was out of the slum district, he made a phone call on the curb.


Five minutes later, a black Maybach pulled up.


He slid in smooth as hell.


Heart pounding, I flagged down a cab and tailed him.


Half an hour later, he walked into a high-end steakhouse.


Five minutes after that, I went in too and sat behind him.


Too nervous to look up, I couldn't see who he was meeting.


But the moment I heard her voice, my whole body froze.


""Knox babe, I've been messing with Sienna just like you asked. She's been so obedient lately!""


Ember Calloway.


Chapter 3


""Good. She needs to learn money doesn't grow on trees.""


Knox's tone was flat. Like he was discussing the weather.


""As promised, I'll take extra care of your family's business.""


""Just don't let Sienna find out yet. After New Year's when my parents get back, I'll tell them.""


My breath hitched.


My heart nearly stopped.


A waiter came over to take my order. I couldn't even speak.


I just pointed at something random on the menu with trembling fingers.


Waved him off before Knox noticed me.


Ember's voice turned syrupy.


""Knox, you told Sienna you sleept in haunted houses for money. But you're actually going home every night. Doesn't that get exhausting?""


""Why didn't you just go abroad with your parents?""


My heart shattered.


So the haunted house thing was a lie too.


This whole time, he'd been going home.


Meaning—


For five years, I was the ONLY ONE suffering.


Knox sighed.


""She's my sister. I couldn't just leave her here alone.""


""Besides, we moved the company overseas, but we'll bring it back eventually.""


His voice got wistful.


""Can't believe the five-year punishment's almost over. Time flies.""


Flies?


I almost laughed.


Every single day of those five years was torture.


Playing a corpse wasn't easy.


Under Ember's orders, I always got the worst, filthiest spots.


Wind or rain, I couldn't move an inch.


Over time, my body broke down—constant chills, my period either disappearing for months or dragging on endlessly.


And to them? It was just punishment.


Hilarious.


""Ember, thanks for all your help these five years. This is for you.""


Their conversation continued.


Knox slid a jewelry box across the table.


Ember opened it and gasped.


""Oh my god, this diamond necklace is gorgeous!""


My heart plummeted.


I recognized it instantly.


Five years ago, I'd begged our parents for that exact necklace as a birthday gift.


They said no—it was too expensive.


I wasn't desperate for it, so I let it go.


Now I realized—that necklace was probably the reason for all of this.


But why?


We had billions. Why did wanting one necklace earn me five years of punishment?


Why did Ember—whose family had less money than ours—get everything she wanted so easily?


Was I a bad daughter? Disobedient?


I'd been good my whole life, never talked back.


So why did I deserve this?


I couldn't hold it in anymore.


I slammed my hand on the table and shot to my feet.


Everyone in the restaurant turned to stare.


Knox spun around, his face going deathly pale.


""Sienna—what are you doing here?""


""Was it fun? Lying to me for five fucking years?"" I demanded


I ripped off my hat and scarf and rushed over, grabbing his sleeve.


""What did I do that was so wrong? Why did you torture me like this?!""


Panic flashed in his eyes. He glanced around, embarrassed, and grabbed my arm.


""Not here. Let's talk outside.""


""You're the one who should be ashamed!""


My eyes were bloodshot as I shook him off and screamed.


""You and Mom and Dad lied to me! Told me we were bankrupt! That you were sleeping in haunted houses!""


""But the whole time they were vacationing in Europe and you were going home every night!""


""From the start to now, I was the only one suffering!""


I completely broke down, tears pouring out.


""Why, Knox? Just tell me why!""


""We have billions and I can't buy a phone? How does that make sense?!""


Knox's face hardened.


""So that's why you asked me earlier. You heard me on the phone.""


He grabbed my wrist again, harder this time, trying to drag me out.


A waiter suddenly rushed over and caught my arm.


""Miss, you haven't paid. That's five thousand dollars.""


Knox froze, then frowned deeply.


""Why did you order such an expensive set? Still don't know how hard it is to earn money?""


Everyone was staring.


Knox stood there and let me squirm under their judgment.


Only when my face went white with humiliation did he finally swipe his card.


Outside, Ember chimed in sweetly.


""Sienna, your family's just trying to teach you a lesson. You should be grateful.""


""Shut up!""


Rage burned through me. I shoved Knox's hand off and slapped Ember across the face.


She screamed, clutching her cheek in shock.


""Crack!""


Knox slapped me back.


""Are you serious right now? If you weren't so spoiled, we wouldn't have had to do this!""


""You think these five years were easy for us?""


""You still don't get it. Clearly the punishment wasn't enough.""


I stood there frozen.


His cold voice echoed in my ears.


My heart went numb.


Finally, I looked up and laughed bitterly.


""Then what if I give you my life—will that be enough?""


""Stop being dramatic.""


Knox's eyes went ice cold. He called his driver and shoved me into the car.


I laughed through my tears.


""We're going home? Which home, exactly?""


He didn't even look at me. Just pulled out his phone and called our parents.


""Yeah, you should come back. Sienna knows everything.""",1,1770087394.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

I wanted more visual personality in the sites I use every day, especially Reddit and YouTube - beyond just dark mode.

So I built [ChibiSkins](https://www.chibiskins.com/), a Chrome extension that applies anime-inspired themes to Reddit and YouTube. I added a couple screenshots in the end to show what I mean.

What it does:

* Anime-style backgrounds, colors, and UI accents, not just wallpapers
* Lightweight and privacy-friendly
* Works on Reddit & YouTube for now (more sites later)

It’s a small project, but this community inspired it, so I wanted to share.

If you’re curious:

The noise of the alarm did its usual. Enough to urge Kasandras brain to shake itself from its sleepy state but not quite enough to wake it fully. She stared at the sunrise soaked ceiling through her half opened eyes as her dreams from the night’s sleep slowly left her mind. She tried her best to remember them but it was like grasping at fog in the air as it slowly drifted away. She shifted her body to the edge of the bed and reached for her clothes she had thrown near it the night before. “Alarm off” she said with a groan as she let out a yawn. Today was going to be a busy day on duty and she was not looking forward to it. One thing was certain coffee was going to be needed and plenty of it. She walked to the kitchen wrestling her clothes onto her body as she did her eyes fixed on the silk silver coffee machine waiting on it to start its usual coffee making as she had programmed it to do so at the same time every day. While it was starting up she took the spare few moments to toss the Chinese fast food containers she had left on the table into the bin. The smell of the cold left over food made her nauseous and she could see the greece from its remains clumping together on its surface to form a thick milky coloured gel. She couldn’t picture how she managed to even eat the stuff the day before. She doubted that the ingredients were even from earth. Plenty of fast food places and restaurants had switched to synthetic meats and other cheaper alternatives as it was cheaper to have it made and shipped from the farms on the moon of Callisto than here on earth. Earth was all about one thing and that was real estate. 38 billion people lived on earth and they all needed somewhere to live. Long gone were the days of four bedroom deluxe houses like she had seen in the history books as a kid in school, she used to be fascinated by them. She couldn’t imagine a person having so much room to themselves and their family. These days’ mega blocks were the standard. They were earth’s great solution to overpopulation. They were almost half a kilometre long and reached high into the sky as far as the eye could see. They could house a total of roughly half a million people in each and were in themselves mini city’s each with its own restaurants, schools and stores. You could be born and die without ever having to leave a mega block which Kasandra knew is what some people did. Many people preferred to stay put rather than leave and face the outside world. They were known as mega block hermits or an M.B.H for short and were very common. She found it somewhat ironic. The more humanity had reached out to the stars the more people clung to their roots like a weeds in a garden digging deep into the soil. That was not her though she wanted to travel out into the stars and see it all. The great city of Valantiar in the south quadrant on the planet Halcar home to the Halcarians or the great vast forests of the planet Malknock which was said to have such beauty it would leave you stunned for days. Of course a trip to the Galactic hub at the centre of the galaxy was also on her site seeing list. It was where all the inhabitants of the galaxy met human and alien alike to discuss important galactic matters. Kasandra knew though that she would likely never see it with her own eyes as only the top elected officials of each planet were allowed to enter and she was far from that. It was set up shortly after the Drashanti the most feared race in the galaxy invaded Earth and were by some miracle defeated. Back then earth was nothing but a primitive planet where space travel was nothing more than a fantasy in sci-fi films. However soon after the Drashanti were defeated that all changed. The news had spread throughout the galaxy and before long Earth had become a tourist attraction for all other alien life eager to see what made the human race so special. After that with some help from these visitors earth’s technology sky rocketed and the stars and planets were no longer out of reach. They had become an extension of the earth itself.    
  “BEEP BEEP BEEP” Kasandra’s train of thought was suddenly whisked away by the loud pinging noise which meant only one thing. The coffee was ready. She grasped the perfectly warmed cup and poured the elixir of life as she like to call it down her dry, parched throat making sure to coat every inch of her mouth while doing it. One thing was certain Coffee was coffee no matter if it was grown on earth or some distant moon. Even though she knew the coffees affects wouldn’t kick in that fast she liked to believe they did. She felt alert and alive again. She left the empty cup down on the table and proceeded to do her morning routine which consisted of her usual going to the bathroom then giving herself a little pep talk in the mirror while she struggled to tie up her long tangled blonde mess of hair. She often considered just shaving it all off just to experience the freedom but knew she would regret it afterword’s.  
 Tomorrow marked one thousand years since the Drashanti were defeated and as like every year after it the world festival would be held to celebrate and commiserate those who gave their lives for it. This of course was why Kasandra was on edge. These next two days would be her busiest of the year. It was common for every small time criminal to try their hand at some robbery or assault as they calculated the cops would be stretched thin today with the preparations and tomorrow with the actual festival. Kasandra had to admit to herself they were right. As a cop herself she knew there was just not enough on the police force to handle it all. She would make more arrests in the next couple of days than she would in a whole month. She let out a sigh; “yep definitely going to need more coffee today” she slid her well-worn jacket that she had received as a present from an old friend a long time ago and slipped her boots over her feet, once on they tightened themselves around her ankles. The boots always reminded her of the little dog Pepper she had when she was a child.  Every day as soon as she got home from school and opened the front door he would come charging down the hall and wrap his tiny brown paws around her foot while looking up at her with his dark brown chestnut eyes and goofy smile. It was the only dog she ever owned and often thought about getting another little ball of fluff to keep her company.  She let a smile cross her face while thinking about it and just for that moment the thought of the day ahead of her felt just that bit lighter.  
She pressed her finger against the scanner beside her front door and it slid open making a scraping noise as it did. Kasandra took a mental note to let maintenance know about it when she got home. She didn’t fancy letting it get worse and find herself stuck outside her door one day when it refused to open.  The typical smell of damp hit her as she walked out and filled her nose leaving room for nothing else. Her apartment was on the 225th floor along with countless others all in a line which turned down at each end to form one big square. The middle was empty looking all the way down to the ground floor. Fences of course were in place from floor to ceiling around the perimeter to stop people falling or throwing themselves off which was more common than she liked to admit. She walked over and took a look down. She wasn’t sure why she did.  It was more out of habit than anything else. She saw what she expected. Kids who were on their way to school staring through the fence as she did, probably making up wild story’s in their heads as all kids do and everyone else like herself on the way to tackle the day’s work they had ahead of them. With the ritual of looking down over she began her long walk down the corridor to the elevators. The walls of the corridor were an off white which Kasandra could only assume were once white in its original state. In many areas the paint was flaking off the walls or gone completely revealing the depressing grey concreate beneath it. This was all lit up by dim circular lights on the ceiling every ten meters or so. There was no chance of real sunshine ever reaching the inside of the mega blocks and this was as good as it got. As she walked Kasandra noticed a few of the lights were blinking or were completely off altogether. Seeing this, her hopes of getting her door fixed slowly stated to diminish. There was little chance they would come to fix her door soon if they couldn’t even fix the corridor lights. Maybe she could take a look at it herself. She did take a mechanics five month course a few years back and hopefully there was still some useful knowledge buried in her brain somewhere that would resurface and help. She wasn’t alone in the corridor of course. Just like the other floors she saw moments ago the corridor was flooded with people. Each in their own little worlds walking and staring at their palm holograms digesting any of the latest news they had missed during their sleep. Kasandra took a moment herself to do the same. She held out the palm of her hand and tapped it twice with her middle finger and the holographic screen came to in front of her floating above her palm. As she expected the feeds were full of news about tomorrows festival and what to expect. She highlighted them all and dismissed them. She would get to see enough of the festival first hand tomorrow on patrol .The feeds were quickly replaced by other news, a person was found after falling off a building and had miraculously survived, A fluff piece on Mc Donald’s and how its survived the last 1150 years in an ever changing world, A lab downtown was broken into but nothing was reported stolen. Properly were just teenagers with nothing better to do she thought. She shut her feed as she got to the elevators. She climbed in with the sea of people and had to stay among them for the whole four minutes it took for the elevator to reach the bottom the heat and stench of other people irritated her but there was nothing she could do. As her father used to say “when you’re in an uncomfortable situation you just have to suck it up and march forward because that’s where growth happens”. She missed her father or Paps as he called him. He had died 8 years ago from cancer. Even with all the advancements in technology and medicine cancer still reigned supreme and unbeatable. He was a tough stoic man who did anything for his family or friends or anyone for that matter and even towards the end he kept a smile of his face despite the pain he was in. He was one of the reasons Kasandra became a cop. Like her Paps she wanted to help do good for others and help weed out the bad in the world. One day she hoped to live up to his memory.  When she finally got out of the elevator she quickly made her way across the main square of the building to the buildings exit but not before grabbing another coffee from one of the small coffee stands that were dotted about along with a small bite to eat.  
Finally after what seemed like forever she was outside breathing in the fresh air if fresh was what you could call it. Still it was better than the recycled crap they pumped out through the ventilation system inside. She made her way to where she last parked her mag lev car which was about a five minute walk. The car had seen better days and the mag lev system was broken but the wheels still worked so it did the job. She opened the door and climbed into it. The cracked synthetic leather seats creaking beneath her as she did. She placed her hand on the finger print scanner and said ”engine start”  The car jerked to life making noises she chose to ignore hoping it wouldn’t keel over and die right there and then.                
The streets were packed. Everywhere she looked something was happening. Eager vendors handing out food or drinks to eager customers , trucks unloading barriers and equipment to set up for the festival with others setting up the barriers as soon as they came off. Cars both above on the mag lev tracks and below on the roads all moving as one like a giant mechanical snakes weaving their way through the city. The Digital billboards hanging off every building advertising just about anything you could imagine hoping to entice some poor suckers to buying whatever it is that was been sold.  The footpaths were barely visible as swarms of people consumed them making their way to wherever they were going for the day. This was city life and although crazy and loud she was well used to it. She had grown up in this city and deep down she knew she would never be able to live the quiet life out in the country side. Once when she was younger in the spring time her Aunty Mary had taken her to the countryside for a weekend getaway. She could remember the rolling hills of lush green grass with colourful  bursts of flowers poking through, tall trees stuck out sprouting their new leafs and there was so many insects.  Everywhere she walked she was plagued by the small flying critters. She would spend ages wiping them off her clothes only to look down a minute later and find new ones had settled and joined the unwanted party on her t-shirt. The air smelt different out there too. It was missing the hint of smoke, the dampness and mixture of foods from vendors that wafted through the city streets. Out in the country side it was just the smell of nature. She never realised until that trip that nature had a distinct smell. The biggest thing she remembered though was the silence. There was no noise of cars beeping their horns, angry drivers shouting at the people in front of them, no constant chatter of people talking non-stop as they went about their daily lives; there was simply nothing but the wind as it passed through the trees. It gave her an eerie feeling like something wasn’t quite right. It made her hair stand on end just thinking about it. That’s when she knew she needed to hustle and bustle of the city. It made her feel whole and was part of who she was.  
It took her almost a half an hour to get to the station compared to her usual fifteen minutes. The dam festivals disruptions were already showing their effects. She swung open front doors of the station.  As expected it was in full swing “Well well well, look what the cat finally dragged in, if it isn’t Miss Kasandra Teal looking as wonderful as ever”. Her annoyance from the traffic faded. She would recognise that low pitched gravelly voice anywhere. She turned around to Greet Tom. Tom had worked with Kasandra for three years now. He was a small man but built strong, his hair a rich dark brown which he had cut military style. His face clean shaven but by the end of the day he would have the makings of a beard poking through. Over the years he had become almost like a brother to her. “I wish I could say the same for you, Kids have you up all night again?” “Yep” he said as he was mid yawn. “Having kids should come with a pre warning especially if you have twins” She gave him a pat on the shoulder “Don’t worry they will grow up one day and you can get back to your drinking”. Tom let out a small laugh, “Hopefully it’s sooner than later I can’t take the thought of changing nappies forever, you ready to hit the streets and hopefully a few criminals today?” “As ready as I will ever be” she said. “Good you go get your gear and I will meet you out front in ten chief said we are to check out just off main street today” She gave him a nod of approval and made her way to her locker in the back room. She did the customary “good morning” to everyone she passed               many not even lifting their heads to respond. She didn’t care though she was not in the humour to engage in pointless conversation unless it was someone she knew well such as Tom.  
 She made her way to the top left locker. She had this locker since she first became a cop and would most likely have it until the day she died.  The locker shone a laser and scanned her eyes. “Welcome Miss Teal said the robotic voice as it unlocked. In it was hung her uniform. It was nanotech weave and well-worn but still in great condition .five years ago it was cutting edge and only available to the military as all new technology is, But now it was Police force patrol attire. She wondered what would be the next hand me down gear that army would release to others in the upcoming years.   Her fire arm lay on a shelf in the locker resting beside it her Badge along with other miscellaneous stuff and a picture of her Paps hung on the door.  She put on her uniform and it came to life. Body armour emerged like magic from the fabric of the suit coating her whole body in black bullet proof panels. Tendrils extended from the suits neck forming an earpiece around her left ear. Her eyes lit up with the heads up display showing information about everything around her and about herself and the suit. It was standard issue to have retina displays installed when you joined the force. When she first had them installed she couldn’t get used to it. So much information was in front of her it made it hard to focus but after years of experience it was just normal to her now. Sometimes she now found it weird not having the information in front of her when she was off duty. It almost felt like she was missing one of her senses. She picked up her firearm and placed it against her leg. The suit responded by wrapping around it to hold it in place. She did the same with her badge but on her chest. It wrapped around it but left the front of the badge on display for others to see. Although the suit added weight to her it always made her feel light and agile. She gave the picture of her Paps one last look and closed the locker. She walked outside the station and two minutes later Tom appeared dressed just as she was. He looked at her with a stern smile “Right let’s get to it”

I'm in college and was going through the on-campus housing selection process with 3 of my friends. We were planning on doing a suite-style dorm where it's two and two in each room and share one bathroom in between the rooms. The issue is I was the only one selected for housing, which I thought would be fine considering I was selected while having a confirmed roommate group of 3 others, but when I went to select rooms for us, there were no 4 beds available whatsoever. I'm a super anxious person, and this was a high-stress level time for me I was freaking out panicking in the middle of a random coffee sho,p rapidly switching from trying to call my 3 friends to ask for advice to my mom to the housing department. They basically told me that we'd have to have a hard conversation and split up the group. (The housing where I live is super horrible, even off-campus ) So I had brought up the idea of splitting two and two, but the issue there was that I was the only one in my group who got the selection email, so it would basically only guarantee me and one other person housing while leaving the two others to wait and hope they would get selected later in the month.  But my friend told me that it would be better to pick an option that had three beds and let only one person fend for themselves, since there'd be a higher chance of an open spot for only one person rather than two. I was panicked and worried that the longer I waited to think about it, the fewer options I'd have left, so I stupidly agreed, and my other friend agreed to drop out of the group. Now, how it's set up, I still get to share a bathroom with two of the friends, but now as well with one random person, and the two friends wanted to stay together, so they're sharing one of the room,s while I'm now rooming with the random. I'm super upset because we werre so excited to all live together and the more I think about it the more i=I wish I had stood up for the idea of splitting into two groups but we had already signed the hosuing contract and got the rooms and trying to back out of it or switch I fear would put the two friends at risk for losing their room but I'm so torn up about it. pls help.

1qufvie,https://i.redd.it/78zb60m4z6hg1.png,Are you being rude while working on your laptop at the cafe?,"I spent most of my free time in coffee shops. When I wasn’t in class or sleeping, I was either working the espresso machine at the Starbucks or sitting at the counter, sipping my free shift coffee and waiting for a latte mistake. The cafe doubled as both a student job and a workspace. Sometimes the library just wasn’t the right place to get work done.

Not much has changed. I still drink multiple cups of coffee while writing, except now I do it on a laptop from home. Like many remote workers, I log on each morning and occasionally need to escape the house for real focus. When distractions pile up, working from a coffee shop becomes the obvious solution.

Coffee shops are ideal for remote work because they offer caffeine, internet, and a low hum of noise that’s productive without being distracting. They’re also convenient for short meetings. But working from a cafe isn’t always simple. Years of “laptop squatters” have led some shops to limit outlets, rotate WiFi passwords, or even ban computers altogether.

Still, laptop users and coffee shops can coexist if everyone is respectful.

First, choose the right cafe. Look for a place with ample seating, a comfortable layout, moderate noise, and a solid food menu. Small, crowded shops aren’t ideal for long work sessions. Reliable WiFi and accessible outlets matter too.

Come prepared, but don’t move in. Bring only what you need: your laptop, charger, headphones, and essentials. Keep your belongings contained and avoid spreading out, especially when it’s busy.

Follow house rules. Coffee shops are businesses, and their policies matter. Respect laptop-only sections, time limits, and cleanup expectations. Wear headphones and be mindful of what you watch or listen to.

If you’re taking up space, buy something. Plan to spend at least $5 per hour, up to an hour and a half, with a tip. If you stay longer, reorder. Large chains may be more flexible, but good judgment still applies.

Don’t expect strangers to watch your things. If you need a quick bathroom break, ask politely or pack up. For longer absences, free the table and move on.

Avoid phone calls. If a call lasts more than a minute, step outside or call back later.

Finally, don’t overstay your welcome. If a cafe is packed or filling up, it’s time to leave. Even under ideal circumstances, four hours is a reasonable maximum. Any longer, and you might owe rent.",1,1770086225.0,LaptopsOut,0,1.0,False

I am planning a trip to Korea this fall and wanted clarification on something I often see online. I have seen on social media that many cafes require each person in a group to order at least one drink/item. I am going with my boyfriend, and we both do not drink coffee, but I love matcha/tea, and really want to try the desserts at some beautiful cafes. 

Will most cafes allow us to get one drink and one or more pastries without requiring that we get a second drink? I would be sad if I have to miss out on trying some great drinks and pastries because we do not want to buy a second drink that won’t be enjoyed.

1qufq99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1qufq99/the_psychology_of_why_quitting_social_media_for/,The Psychology of Why Quitting Social Media for Books Fixed My Brain (and the Science That Proves It),"So here's the thing nobody wants to admit, we're all getting stupider and we know it. I spent like 3 years watching my attention span shrink to the size of a TikTok video while telling myself I was ""staying informed"" by doomscrolling Twitter. The breaking point? I realized I hadn't finished a single book in 8 months but could tell you everything about random internet drama from 2 weeks ago. That's embarrassing as hell.

I started researching this rabbit hole, books, neuroscience papers, podcasts from people way smarter than me, and turns out our brains are literally being rewired by social media. The constant dopamine hits, the outrage cycles, the comparison trap, it's all by design. Companies hire PhDs to make their apps as addictive as slot machines. But here's what actually helped me break free and rewire my brain back to something functional.

**The Dopamine Nation framework completely changed how I see addiction.** Dr. Anna Lembke from Stanford wrote this insanely good book that explains why we're all hooked on everything. She's one of the world's leading experts on addiction, and she breaks down how our brains adapted for scarcity are completely fucked in this age of abundance. The pleasure-pain balance concept she describes, where every high is followed by an equal low, made me understand why scrolling always left me feeling worse. She recommends a 30 day dopamine fast from your drug of choice, which sounds extreme but actually resets your brain's reward system. This book will make you question everything you think you know about happiness and why nothing feels satisfying anymore.

What actually worked for me was **making reading physically easier than opening Instagram.** I deleted all social apps from my phone and kept a book on my nightstand, another in my bag, one in the bathroom. Sounds stupid but when you're bored waiting for coffee, you'll read whatever's closest. I also started using this app called Freedom that blocks websites and apps on a schedule. You can set it to lock you out of social media during specific hours, like evenings or weekends. Game changer because willpower is finite and I have approximately zero of it.

Another thing that helped was BeFreed, an AI learning app that turns books, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio. You can literally type in what you want to fix, like ""break social media addiction and build better habits,"" and it pulls from quality sources to create a custom podcast with an adaptive learning plan tailored to your struggle. The depth is adjustable too, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something really clicks. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, there's this smoky, almost ASMR-quality voice that made listening way more enjoyable than I expected. Made it easier to replace scrolling time with actual learning, especially during commutes or at the gym.

**The research on deep reading versus skimming is pretty alarming.** Maryanne Wolf, a cognitive neuroscientist, has done extensive work showing that digital reading actually changes our brain circuits. We develop pattern recognition for skimming but lose the neural pathways for deep comprehension and empathy. When you read deeply, your brain activates regions involved in physical sensation and movement, like you're actually experiencing what you're reading. Social media trains your brain to skim, judge quickly, move on. Books force you to slow down and actually think, which feels uncomfortable at first because your brain is literally out of practice.

I started with **Stolen Focus by Johann Hari** because it directly addresses why we can't concentrate anymore. Hari spent three years interviewing experts and the book covers everything from Silicon Valley's attention extraction tactics to how surveillance capitalism profits from fragmenting our focus. He also did this experiment where he went to a beach house with no internet for three months, which is extreme but his insights about what happened to his brain are fascinating. The section on how social media affects children is genuinely disturbing. Best book on attention I've ever read.

For fiction that actually competed with the dopamine hit of scrolling, **Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir** absolutely slapped. It's a science thriller that's so engaging I stayed up until 3am reading, something I hadn't done since high school. Sometimes you need books that feel like entertainment to remember why reading is better than scrolling through rage bait.

The unexpected benefit nobody talks about is **how much reading improved my actual conversations.** Social media made me think in hot takes and snarky responses. Books, especially narrative nonfiction and novels, helped me think in nuance again. I had actual interesting things to talk about instead of regurgitating tweets. My vocabulary expanded. I could focus during meetings without checking my phone every 5 minutes.

**Digital minimalism as a philosophy made everything click.** Cal Newport's approach isn't about going full Luddite, it's about being intentional with technology. He argues that we never actually chose to let these apps colonize our lives, we just drifted into it because everyone else did. His 30 day declutter process helps you figure out what actually adds value versus what's just filling time. The book has practical strategies for restructuring your leisure time around high quality activities like reading instead of passive scrolling.

The transformation wasn't instant. First few weeks sucked because my brain kept craving that scroll reflex. But around week 3, I noticed I could actually focus for 30 minutes straight. By month 2, I'd finished 6 books and felt sharper than I had in years. My anxiety dropped significantly because I wasn't constantly absorbing other people's problems and opinions. Sleep improved because I wasn't looking at screens before bed.

The psychological research backs this up too. Studies show that heavy social media use correlates with increased depression, anxiety, and loneliness, while reading, especially fiction, increases empathy and emotional intelligence. Your brain literally becomes what you feed it. Feed it rage bait and comparison traps, you'll feel like shit. Feed it complex narratives and challenging ideas, you'll actually grow.

Social media isn't going away and I'm not saying never use it. But swapping even half your scroll time for reading changes your brain chemistry in measurable ways. You become more focused, less reactive, more thoughtful. You remember what it feels like to actually finish something instead of endlessly consuming content that evaporates from your memory.",3,1770085838.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

1qufllg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/1qufllg/california_state_workers_face_july_1/,California State Workers Face July 1 Return-to-Office Mandate - What Sacramento Residents Should Know,"Around 100,000 California state employees are scheduled to return to the office 4 days per week starting July 1, 2026. This will directly impact Sacramento traffic, the environment, and the local economy.

**Background: What's Happening**

During the COVID-19 pandemic, most California state employees shifted to remote or hybrid work. In March 2025, Governor Newsom issued Executive Order N-22-25, which requires most state workers to be physically in the office 4 days per week.

The largest state employee union - SEIU Local 1000, representing about 100,000 workers - filed a lawsuit challenging this mandate and negotiated a one-year delay. That delay was set to expire July 1, 2025, but got pushed to July 1, 2026.

Right now, the union and the state are negotiating a new employment contract. The current contract expires June 30, 2026 - literally one day before the return-to-office mandate is scheduled to take effect. This timing is significant because it means telework policy is part of active contract negotiations.

**What This Means for Sacramento**

Sacramento is California's capital and has tens of thousands of state employees. When this mandate takes effect:

**Traffic Impact:**

* Thousands of additional cars on the road during morning and evening rush hours
* Increased congestion on major routes (Highway 50, Business 80, Capitol City Freeway)
* Longer commute times for everyone, not just state workers

**Environmental Impact:**

* Significant increase in vehicle emissions from daily commuting
* More air pollution in the Sacramento region
* Conflicts with California's climate goals and clean air initiatives

**Economic Impact:**

* More foot traffic downtown for lunch, coffee, errands during work hours
* BUT state workers will have less discretionary income to spend (gas costs $4-5/gallon, parking costs add up, childcare costs for families)
* Some downtown businesses may benefit, but workers themselves will be stretched thinner financially

**Housing and Community Impact:**

* Many people were hired remotely during the pandemic and chose to live far from Sacramento (Stockton, Tracy, even the Bay Area)
* These workers now face tough choices: long daily commutes, relocating closer to Sacramento, or leaving state employment
* Potential housing market impacts as people relocate

**What California's Own Auditor Found**

In September 2025, the California State Auditor (an independent government watchdog) released an official report evaluating state telework policies. Here's what they found:

[https://www.auditor.ca.gov/reports/2024-118/](https://www.auditor.ca.gov/reports/2024-118/)

* **Cost savings**: Telework saves the state significant money on office costs when employees work remotely 3 or more days per week. This means the return-to-office mandate will actually COST taxpayers more money.
* **Productivity**: No negative impact found on productivity, collaboration, or customer service. State services continued functioning well with remote work.
* **Employee recruitment and retention**: Telework improves the state's ability to hire and keep qualified employees, especially when competing with private sector jobs.
* **Manager and employee surveys**: Both groups reported that telework benefits departments and employees.

**The Governor's Justification**

Governor Newsom's executive order cited the need for ""collaboration and communication, leading to faster, more effective decision-making"" and ""operational efficiency.""

However, when the California State Legislature asked the Newsom administration for specific data, costs, or evidence supporting these claims in May 2025, they received minimal details. No comprehensive cost-benefit analysis was provided.

This is significant: the state's independent auditor found telework saves money and works well, but the administration hasn't provided counter-evidence for why forcing people back is necessary.

**What's Happening Right Now (February 2026)**

Contract negotiations between SEIU Local 1000 and CalHR (California Department of Human Resources, which handles state employment) started January 14, 2026. These negotiations will continue through June 30.

The union is pushing for:

* Another delay of the July 1 deadline
* Reducing the requirement (maybe 3 days in-office instead of 4)
* Expanding exceptions for who can continue working remotely
* Giving individual departments more flexibility to decide what works for them

Whether any of this succeeds depends on:

* How strongly union members participate (attending meetings, filling out surveys, showing up to actions)
* Whether state legislators publicly support workers (the Legislature sided with workers last year when Newsom tried to cancel a negotiated raise)
* Public pressure on the Governor's office
* How the negotiations go over the next 5 months

**Why This Matters to Non-State-Workers**

Even if you don't work for the state, this affects you:

1. **Traffic**: Your commute will get worse when thousands more cars hit the road daily
2. **Taxes**: The State Auditor found telework saves money. Forcing people back costs MORE taxpayer dollars
3. **Air quality**: More emissions affect everyone's health
4. **Precedent**: If the state forces workers back despite evidence it's wasteful, private employers in the region may feel emboldened to do the same

**What People Can Do**

**If you're a state worker:**

* Participate in union contract surveys (bargaining priorities are based on what members say matters most)
* Join SEIU Local 1000 if you haven't already (higher membership gives the union more bargaining power)
* Contact your state legislator - they've supported state workers before
* Attend union meetings and actions when called
* Check for updates: [https://www.seiu1000.org/2026contract/](https://www.seiu1000.org/2026contract/)

**If you're not a state worker but care about this issue:**

* Contact Governor Newsom's office: [https://www.gov.ca.gov/contact/](https://www.gov.ca.gov/contact/)
* Contact your state legislators (Assembly member and State Senator)
* Reference the State Auditor report when you contact them - it shows telework saves taxpayer money
* If you own a business affected by state worker commutes or spending, make your voice heard

**Timeline to Watch:**

* **Now through June 30, 2026**: Active contract negotiations happening
* **March 1, 2026 or later**: State and union are required to meet and discuss the RTO timeline (per the 2025 agreement)
* **June 30, 2026**: Current contract expires
* **July 1, 2026**: Return-to-office mandate scheduled to take effect

**The Bottom Line**

Sacramento is about to see a major shift in traffic patterns, air quality, and how tens of thousands of residents spend their workdays. The state's own independent auditor said the current remote work setup saves money and works well. The mandate is proceeding anyway unless negotiations change the outcome.

This is happening in less than 5 months.

[**Gettin' Down on the Mountain** by Corb Lund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uASQgLwaIs) -- This song is a critique of those survivalists who fantasize about society falling apart so they can just run into the mountains and live happily-ever-after. The narrator is presumably *already* prepared for society to potentially fall apart as each verse is a series of questions asking how you'll react once the very fabric of society starts to rip. The last two verses going from ""Can you spare some ammo? to ""Can you pass the ammo?"" implies that world in the song is *still* devolving after doomsday. 

Perhaps this kind of ""Tory survivalism"" could just be called plain old Toryism, as Tories were generally the losers of bloody civil wars, and their descendants remember what happens when everything falls apart. That part about ""overcrowding"" & ""it's kerosene lamps and candles"" resonates quite strongly with me given how my own mother is the youngest of 18, and her side of the family didn't get running water/electricity until the early 1970s; an uncle of mine had a small TV he would hook up to his car battery to watch the news. I can only imagine how those poor people in Preston or Eskasoni had it in the same time-frame.

[**Canol Road** by Stan Rogers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMBiKcmKyq0) -- This song is about a Canadian mountain man up north who likes to spend the endless winters shooting trees and small game, and who ends up getting into a barfight at the Kopper King Bar in Whitehorse, Yukon which results in a man's death. After that deadly barfight, our mountain man flees the scene through the Canol Road, which he needs his 4x4 to traverse. However, he doesn't have enough gas to survive the night, and the police find his frozen body. Whether in the high-north or not, I think every rural Canadian knows the type that can become a ""bear in a blood-red mackinaw"".

[**The Truth Comes Out** by Corb Lund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5TWgc8aVe4&t=80s) -- This song is about the effects of climate change in rural communities, with a particular focus on how big predators are getting driven closer and closer to civilization due to funny weather. This song always pops into my head when I visit the rural community my father grew up in; back in the '60s and '70s he could walk through those woods and only encounter small/medium game, while now the locals tend to carry knives when on their property due to coyotes being on the main roads, and with black bears being in the blueberry fields. I think the line, ""Only old chiefs older than Jesus can save us now; if we're lucky"" hits home just how *old* indigenous culture across Canada is.

[**Night Guard** by Stan Rogers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZt_Kcoi3Ck) -- This song is a *classic* Country & Western story; an aging cowboy is getting too old for rodeo riding, and manages to save enough to buy a farm with the love of his life to *finally* start a family of his own. However, shortly thereafter local castle-rustlers start stealing his herd; the police don't have enough proof to prosecute the known rustlers, while the bank is simultaneously threatening to foreclose his family farm due to the now lack of profits. As he's being backed into a no-win situation, that cowboy decides to stay up one night to witness the cattle rustling for himself, before gunning the thieves down with the rifle that he *promised* his wife he was only going to buy for hunting. The cowboy then turns himself in to the police, and is presumably convicted for murder as the chorus ""...now he spends his time pulling night guard"" changes in the last verse to ""...now he's doing time pulling night guard"".

The song has a strong hint of a ""natural law & order"" message in the sense that the protagonist made the conscience choice to murder criminals, while simultaneous making the conscience choice to face the societal consequences of that action; arguably everyone got what was deserved in the end. This song is also unambiguous in it's Western Canadian setting: the gun the cowboy buys is a Winchester Repeating Rifle chambered in the standard British .303 caliber, while the ""blacked-out REO"" was presumably built in a Canadian branch-plant of the REO Motor Company.

>Chorus: *

>He was star of all the rodeos but now they rob him blind

>It took eighteen years of Brahma bulls and life on the line

>To get this spread and a decent herd

>But now [he spends his time/he's doing time] pulling night guard

---

>Forty-four's no age to start again

>But the bulls were getting tough and he was never free of pain

>Where others blew their winnings getting tanked

>Most of his got banked, saving for the farm

>/

>He never thought she'd wait for him at all

>'Cause she wanted more than broken bones and trophies on the wall

>But when he quit and finally got the farm

>She ran into his arms, and now they've got a kid

>*

>He told her that he got it for the game

>A Winnie three-o-three with his initials on the frame

>Riding in the scabbard at his knee, tonight he's gonna see

>Who's getting all the stock

>/

>Seventh one this summer yesterday

>Half a year of profits gone and now there's hell to pay

>The cops say they know who but there's no proof

>The banker hit the roof, and damn near took the farm

>*

>He hears the wire a-poppin' by the road

>Sees the blacked-out REO coming for another load

>This time it's not one they take but two

>Two minutes and they're through, and laughing in the cab

>/

>And here will be the end to this tonight

>'Cause all the proof he needs is lying steady in his sights

>It may be just the worst thing he could do

>But he squeezes off a few, then make his call to town

[**Waltzing Matilda** preformed by Slim Dusty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqtttbbYfSM) -- This classic Australian song from 1895, that some would consider to be the proper national anthem, arguably conveys a similar ""natural law"" theme to ""*Night Guard*"", just from the perspective of a rustler instead; certainly a sign of Australia being a ""radical"" fragment rather than a ""tory-touched liberal"" fragment.  It is a song, after all, about about a sheep-thief who is caught red-handed by the law, and who decides to kill himself by drowning rather than be taken into custody. Funny enough, both my parents were taught this song in school, but I wasn't. 

---

>Once a jolly swagman camped by a billabong

>Under the shade of a coolibah tree

>He sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled

>""You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.""

>...

>Down came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong

>Up jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee

>He sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag

>""You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.""

>...

>Up rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred

>Up rode the troopers, one, two, and three

>""With that jolly jumbuck that you've got in your tucker bag

>You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.""

>...

>Up jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong.

>""You'll never take me alive!"" said he

>And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong:

>""You'll come a-waltzing Matilda, with me.""

>...

[**Poor Ned** by Redgum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6SllcxLqNw) -- This is another song that could be said to be an example of Australia being a ""radical"" fragment. For those unaware of the song's protagonist, Ned Kelly, he was the Australian outlaw who crafted a suit of metal-armour out farming equipment for one last gunfight, before being eventually captured by the law and executed. 

While I do think Poor Ned is indeed better off dead -- certainly the honest-working-people of Australia were better off -- I've always personally loved the line, ""I don't know what's right or wrong, but they hung Christ on nails""; Given how Kelly's family was treated, I could almost see that being a similar justification in motives for the protagonist in Stan Roger's *Night Guard* as well.

Unlike Irish Rebel music, [which I have some ideological problems with](https://novascotialoyalist.substack.com/p/red-tories-and-the-ndp-part-x-exploring), I can quite enjoy this song about Ned Kelly in a similar manner as the traditional English folk song which glories the low-life criminal Dick Turpin -- Ewan Maccoll's version of [**Turpin Hero**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0UA2UjJYbU) is my personal favourite, and is honestly one of my favourite songs. 

---

>Chorus: *

>Poor Ned, You're better off dead

>At least you'll get some peace of mind

>You're out on the track, they're right on your back

>Boy they're gonna hang you high

---

>Eighteen-hundred-and-seventy-eight was the year I remember so well

>They put my father in an early grave and slung my mother in jail

>Now I don't know what's right or wrong, but they hung Christ on nails

>Six kids at home and two still on the breast, they wouldn't even give us bail

>*

>You know I wrote a letter 'bout Stringy-Bark Creek, so they would understand

>That I might be a bushranger, but I'm not a murdering man

>I didn't want to shoot Kennedy, or that copper Lonnigan

>He alone could have saved his life by throwing down his gun

>*

>You know they took Ned Kelly, and they hung him in the Melbourne jail

>He fought so very bravely, dressed in iron mail

>And no man single handed, can hope to break the bars

>There's a thousand like Ned Kelly, who'll hoist the flag of stars

[**I Was Only Nineteen (A Walk In The Light Green)** by Redgum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gmgwx77osw) -- This is a song which remembers the Australian and New Zealeander veterans of the Vietnam War. The protagonist is only 19 during his tour of duty, after which he suffers lifelong medical problems -- from Agent Orange exposure, to suffering PTSD flashbacks of his friends getting killed in the jungle, to living with shrapnel wounds that he received. 

I've always found these lines particularly haunting, ""And Frankie kicked a mine the day that mankind kicked the moon / God help me, he was goin' home in June"". The day Niel Armstrong first walked on the moon was July 21, 1969.

---

>Mum and Dad and Denny saw the passing out parade at Puckapunyal

>The sixth battalion was the next to tour, and it was me who drew the card

>We did Canungra, and Shoalwater before we left

>And Townsville lined the footpaths as we marched down to the quay

>This clipping from the paper shows us young and strong and clean

>And there's me in me slouch hat with me SLR and greens

>God help me, I was only 19

>/

>From Vũng Tàu riding Chinooks to the dust at Nui Dat

>I'd been in and out of choppers now for months

>And we made our tents a home, V.B. and pinups on the lockers

>And an Asian orange sunset through the scrub

>/

>And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?

>And nighttime's just a jungle dark and a barking M16?

>And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?

>God help me, I was only 19

>/

>A four-week operation, when each step could mean your last one on two legs

>It was a war within yourself

>But you wouldn't let your mates down 'til they had you dusted off

>So you closed your eyes and thought about somethin' else

>/

>And then someone yelled out, ""Contact!"", and the bloke behind me swore

>We hooked in there for hours, then a God almighty roar

>And Frankie kicked a mine the day that mankind kicked the moon

>God help me, he was goin' home in June

>/

>And I can still see Frankie, drinkin' tinnies in the Grand Hotel

>On a thirty-six-hour rec leave in Vung Tau

>And I can still see Frankie, lying screaming in the jungle

>'Til the morphine came and killed the bloody row

>/

>And the ANZAC legends didn't mention mud and blood and tears

>And the stories that my father told me never seemed quite real

>I caught some pieces in my back that I didn't even feel

>God help me, I was only 19

>/

>And can you tell me, doctor, why I still can't get to sleep?

>And why the Channel Seven chopper chills me to my feet?

>And what's this rash that comes and goes, can you tell me what it means?

>God help me, I was only 19

[**The Long Run** by Redgum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLrJa-fKIvw) -- This is a song about political activism that I think both democratic socialists and left-leaning Tories should be able to enjoy just about equally. It's about all the different political fights that have taken place in one's own lifetime, noting that despite all wins and the losses, it'll always be alright in the long run -- so long as you actually keep up the good fight. I've always loved the line, ""We've taken some right turns, they've been the wrong ones""

---


>You look out your window at the cold grey dawn, 

>It's seven o'clock on a Monday morning

>Pour a cup of coffee, better make it a strong one

>""It's going to rain and it's going to blow,

>It'll be all right, it'll be all right, it'll be all right in the long run""

>/

>Australia marched out of Vietnam

>Out in the streets against Uncle Sam

>We won the fight, it was a long one

>From the shadow of history a convict screams

>The shearers curse, the people dream

>We've taken some right turns, they've been the wrong ones

>The Troop ships leave and the headlines blaze:

>""Australia remembers happier days

>And the faith lives on within the haze

>It'll be all right in the long run""

>/

>So you sit in your camp and you stare at the fire

>The doubt drops away as the hopes get higher

>And you sing to yourself:

>""It'll be all right, be all right in the long run""

>/

>And the sun gives ground to a long cold night

>And you screw up your courage for another fight

>But you know in your heart

>It'll be all right, be all right in the long run

>/

>And the sun streams in with power and might

>You look at your kids in a different light

>You know in your heart as you kiss them goodnight

>It'll be all right in the long run

[**Student Visas** by Corb Lund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZgX2Q5vNNI) – This is a song that could perhaps be considered a modern “historical ballad”, a sub-genre of Country & Western that lead to many hits for Johnny Horton in the 1950s. “Student Visas” tells the story of the Iran-Contra affair from the perspective of a US special forces soldier who is wounded in Central America while on a covert mission that goes wrong, and the cover-up that took place after. 

---

>They took away our dogtags, they had us grow our hair

>They gave us student visas when we were over there

>My great-great rode at Shiloh, and Grandpa drove a tank

>Daddy was air cavalry, flew choppers in Da Nang 

>I worked mostly clandestine, the branch I should not say (CIA)

>We played with better guns and I could use the extra pay

>Did Reagan give the order? Did cocaine pay the bill?

>They said we's fightin' communists but it was kinda hard to tell

>There ain't no fun in killin' folk and I don't wanna do no more

>/


>This was before Blackhawks, and RPGs were king

>My buddy on the door gun, well he never felt a thing

>When our Huey caught a rocket, and both the pilots killed

>And they pitched us over sideways on some Nicaraguan hill

>My back felt like it's broken, my legs I could not feel

>I kept on shooting communists but it was kind of hard to tell

>There ain't no fun in killin' folk and I ain't gonna do no more

>/


>I never did heal up right from injuries sustained

>Officially in Germany, officially while we trained

>I remember all their faces, I dream about them still

>I guess we's fightin' communists but it was kinda hard to tell

>There ain't no fun in killin' folk, and I don't wanna do no more

[**Horse Soldier, Horse Soldier** by Corb Lund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVh88CkBIKw) – This song is another song in the historical ballad tradition, and is a “greatest hits” of various societies, units, and people who fought and died on horseback from over the centuries. Some events included are the Charge of the Light Brigade, The Battle of the Little Bighorn, The Russian Civil War, The Mayerthorpe murders, and the Crusades.

---

>Chorus:  *

>I'm a hussar, I'm a Hun, I'm a wretched Englishman

>Routing Bonaparte at Waterloo

>I'm a dragoon on a dun, I'm a Cossack on the run

>I'm a horse soldier, timeless, through and through

---

>Well, I's with Custer and the 7th, in '76 or '77

>Scalped at Little Big Horn by the Sioux

>And the tears and devastation of a once proud warrior nation

>This I know 'cause I was riding with them too

>/


>And I drank mare's blood on the run when I rode with the Great Khan

>On the frozen Mongol steppe while at his height

>And I's a White Guard, I's a Red Guard

>I's the Tsar's own palace horse guard

>When Romanov was murdered in the night

>/

>And I knew Saladin and rode his swift Arabians

>Harassing doomed crusaders on their heavy drafts

>And yet I rode the Percheron against the circling Saracen

>Once again against myself was cast

>*

>Well, I've worn the Mounties' Crimson, if you're silent and you'll listen

>You'll know that it was with them that I stood

>When Mayerthorpe, she cried, as her four horsemen died

>Gunned down in scarlet, cold as blood

>/


>Well, I's the 'firstest with the mostest' when I fought for Bedford Forrest

>Suffered General Wilson's Union raid

>And mine was not to reason why, mine was but to do or die

>At Crimea with the charging light brigade

>On hire from Swiss or Sweden, be me Christian, be me heathen

>The devil to the sabre I shall put

>That we may see a swelling in our ranks

 [**Jim Bridger** by Johnny Horton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SmZy_b-qlU) – So far as I can tell, this song is an almost completely fictional dramatization of the life of the American explorer Jim Bridger. I’ve included it in this collection to give the idea of a typical 1950s Country & Western historical ballad -- I also happen to love the verse mentioning Custer at the Little Bighorn. 

---

>Chorus: *

>Let's drink to old Jim Bridger, yes, lift your glasses high

>As long as there's the USA don't let his memory die

>That he was making history never once occurred to him

>But I doubt if we'd been here if it weren't for men like Jim

---

>Once there was a mountain man who couldn't write his name

>Yet he deserves a front row seat in history's hall of fame

>He forgot more about the Indians than we will ever know

>He spoke the language of the Sioux, the Black Foot and the Crow

>*

>He spoke with General Custer and said listen Yellow Hair

>The Sioux are the great nation so treat 'em fair and square

>Sit in on their war council, don't laugh away their pride

>But Custer didn't listen, at Little Big Horn Custer died

>*

>There's poems and there's legends that tell of Carson's fame

>Yet compared to Jim Bridger, Kit was civilized and tame

>These words are straight from Carson's lips, if you place that story by him

>If there's a man who knows this god forsaken land it's Jim

>*

[**Dixieland** by Steve Earle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivbNEXjuu_4) – This song is included to give an idea of what a modern American historical ballad can look like when crossed with a left-wing ideology. This song commemorates Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain of the 20th Maine, who lead a down-hill bayonet charge at the Battle of Gettysburg when his men ran out of ammo after a long day of fighting. The song is sung from the perspective of a fictional character who appeared in the book “*Killer Angels*” and in the movie “*Gettysburg*”, and he’s a former Irish rebel who ends up fighting in the Union Army after fleeing Ireland; if that character didn’t die at Little Round Top, one has to wonder if he would have been one of the Fenians who invaded Canada following the Civil War. 

I personally quite like the song, but especially after listening to Earle’s live introduction, I can’t help but shake this feeling of, “If I was an American, wouldn’t it be kind of *dangerous* to be liking a song so much about killing my own countrymen?” In general, I can’t stand modern American liberals who will condemn the treason of Virginians like Robert E. Lee or Jefferson Davis, but will simultaneously glorify the treason of Virginians like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson; given the times they lived, all four deserved the noose equally. At least those Confederate traitors were honest about their horrid beliefs...

>I am the Kilrain, I'm a fightin' man

>And I come from County Clare

>The vilest tub afloat

>And the captain's brother was a railroad man

>And he met us at the boat

Does it mean anything?,"***BACKSTORY***: I live in a condo complex with eight units per building. Six of my neighbors are fine, but since every multi-family dwelling has to have at least one of *those* nightmare neighbors, there's a couple that moved in five years ago that do super weird things and are also incredibly rude — my problem is mostly with the guy. Here's a short list of just a few shitty things my shitty neighbor has done:

- Made racist comments toward my guests multiple times (I don't have friends over anymore because of this)

- Comes out to his porch to glare at my partner or I when we take out trash or go outside to wait for DoorDash; sometimes follows me to the trash bins but doesn't throw anything away

- Made vaguely threatening statements like ""I work for the CIA [occasionally he says that he's FBI or undercover DEA] so I could have the cops here for you in 30 seconds.” (He hasn't worked outside of the house in the five years he's lived here, and I've NEVER seen him drive...his wife is always driving their car and he rides a bike).

- Threw away my travel coffee mug that I accidentally left on the trunk of my car when I was cleaning out my car. 

***THE PICTURE***: Saturday night/early Sunday morning I left home at 1:30AM to pick up my kid and his friends from a party. When I got home around 2:10AM this Knights Templar picture was on the floor of my porch along with a mini Bic lighter next to it. I can't prove that my weird neighbor put it there but...it's pretty on brand right? Nobody else's porch had anything on them. It's been snowing almost constantly and there's only a little water damage on the paper, so it was printed right before it was left on my porch (from a mediocre home printer) and it hadn't been there very long. Most of my neighbors are older and go to bed early, but shitty neighbor's lights were still on when I left and came back.

Is this just more loony toons shit that's ultimately meaningless, or is there some other message being conveyed? How would you respond if you were me? Or would you throw it away and not respond at all? ",0,1770085366.0,whatisit,7,0.5,False
1qufi79,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIToolsPerformance/comments/1qufi79/complete_guide_building_a_budgetfriendly_repo/,Complete guide: Building a budget-friendly repo auditor with Qwen3 Coder and Gemini 2.5,"Auditing a 200,000-line repository used to be a nightmare that cost hundreds of dollars in tokens or required massive local hardware. With the release of **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** and the **Qwen3 Coder 30B**, we can now build a ""Map and Analyze"" pipeline that costs less than a cup of coffee.

The strategy is simple: use Gemini’s massive **1,048,576 token context window** ($0.10/M) to index the entire project and identify ""hot zones,"" then feed those specific files into **Qwen3 Coder 30B** ($0.07/M) for the heavy lifting. Qwen3’s A3B architecture makes it incredibly fast for logic-heavy tasks.

**Step 1: The Librarian Phase (Mapping)**
First, we send the entire codebase to Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite. We aren't asking for a full audit yet; we just want a structural map of where the most complex logic lives.

python
import requests

def get_repo_map(full_codebase):
    prompt = f""Map the following codebase. Identify the top 5 most complex files regarding state management and security. \n\n {full_codebase}""
    # Call Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite via OpenRouter
    # Model: google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite


**Step 2: The Architect Phase (Analysis)**
Once Gemini identifies the five critical files, we pull those specific snippets and send them to **Qwen3 Coder 30B**. This model is specifically tuned for code and outperforms almost everything in its weight class for spotting syntax edge cases and logical fallacies.

**The Config for Qwen3 Coder:**
Use a low temperature to ensure the code suggestions are stable.

json
{
  ""model"": ""qwen/qwen-3-coder-30b-instruct"",
  ""temperature"": 0.2,
  ""max_tokens"": 4096,
  ""top_p"": 0.9
}


**Step 3: Implementation Script**
Here is a simplified Python script to orchestrate the hand-off:

python
import json

def run_budget_audit(files_to_scan):
    for file_path, content in files_to_scan.items():
        print(f""Analyzing {file_path} with Qwen3 Coder..."")
        
        response = requests.post(
            url=""https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"",
            headers={""Authorization"": f""Bearer {API_KEY}""},
            data=json.dumps({
                ""model"": ""qwen/qwen-3-coder-30b-instruct"",
                ""messages"": [
                    {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a senior security architect.""},
                    {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": f""Review this for race conditions:\n{content}""}
                ]
            })
        )
        print(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])


**Why this works in 2026**
The **Qwen3 Coder 30B** uses the **A3B (Active 3B)** architecture, meaning it only activates a fraction of its parameters per token. This gives you the reasoning of a 30B model with the speed and cost of a much smaller assistant. By pairing it with Gemini’s context window, you avoid the ""lost in the middle"" issues that plague single-model audits.

I’ve found that this dual-model approach catches about 30% more logical errors than just dumping everything into a single large-context window.

They might send a flood of people here to discredit me by calling me crazy or poking holes in my logic. The herd mentality is very real so they will manufacture a herd to come here and discredit me, so you follow the herd they created. They will also downvote my post and comments while upvoting all of their own comments to give the illusion that no one believes me. Be aware of this. They also might not do it either. They have been doing it less and less lately

Here is some proof that they send people to discredit you by calling you crazy and acting like they are not a mason. They did it on my previous post but then admitted it was them then threw a tantrum because I won't join them. They are doing the same thing here in this comment section

[Masonic Tantrum After I Exposed the Truth - Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/masonic-tantrum-after-i-exposed-truth-QOKvKS9)



Here is their secret

Study astrology, alchemy, witchcraft, voodoo, etc. The topics that they want you to believe are ridiculous. They are very real. They don't want you to study it because they don't want you to gain that much power and use it against them.  

The 12 apostles are based on the 12 zodiac signs. Jesus lived to be 33 years old, there are also 33 degrees in the Masonic Scottish Rite. There are 33 bones in your spine. The kundalini begins at the base of your spine when the moon passes through your zodiac sign each month.  

They intentionally threw off this cycle by making 12 months in a year rather than 13 months to match the 13 zodiac signs. The solar calendar does not match the lunar calendar on purpose. The 13th zodiac was erased from history. The Ophiuchus or the serpent bearer, like the serpent in the garden of Eden. The serpent in the garden is debated to be Lucifer. Both Lucifer and Jesus are known as the morning star. Venus is also known as the morning star. 

Each day it ascends one bone as long as you refrain from the deadly sins. No sex, no wrath, no gluttony, that's why fasting is important. And also, why we as Americans are over fed and have a higher rate of obesity. Because they are trying to stuff our faces with food, so we don't accidentally open our third eye. Also, no acidic foods. It will destroy the kundalini. No coffee either. If it is a major addiction in the US then avoid it. No caffeine, no sugar, no nicotine, no drugs, and so on. The only exception is DMT, I know this is a psychedelic drug that they use in their rituals to assist in opening their third eye.  

Everything in the US is structured to make sure we never reach this state.  

Lust, Men are taught that the more women they have sex with the cooler they are. Women are taught that OnlyFans is empowering. Porn is also free and sex is in all media.  

Envy, we are taught to envy the rich. Their expensive homes, their fast cars, designer clothes, and exotic trips. 

Wrath, we are taught to hate each other for one reason or another whether it be for race, religion, sex, political beliefs, etc.  

Pride, we are taught to take pride in our nation to the point of ignorance and blind belief in authority. 

Gluttony, we are overfed as Americans which is why we have such a high rate of obesity. Our food is also tainted with ingredients that hinder our chances of reaching this state. Eat kosher foods, the tiny hats that are hiding this information would not do this to their own people.

Sloth, we are fed sites like Tik Tok and social media where we spend more time doom scrolling than we do exercising or attempting to build a better life for ourselves. 

Greed, we are taught to look out after ourselves only. We are made to believe in the scarcity mindset, where there aren't enough resources to go around so we keep more for ourselves and never share.  We take more than we need and even at the cost of others.

You must also feel authentic compassion towards others. The point is to open your heart. The saying ""Heart of gold"" did not come from nowhere. Scientists found that there are more pathways sending signals from the heart to the brain than from the brain to the heart. There is a reason the heart was considered the most important part of your body in ancient times. 

Once it makes it to the top of our spine into the pineal gland it stays there for a few days. Jesus was resurrected on the third day. On the third day it drops down back to the base of our spine.  

Congratulations you are now a god. You can manipulate reality around you and even read minds of others. Your mind will exist on a higher plane than this 3 dimensional one so you can access other objects that are on that plane though unconsciously, including other people's minds. You will retain your memory after death because this body is temporary, but your mind has now accessed a higher plane of existence. You will be born in a new body after some time of void and darkness, but you will keep all the memories of your past life. You are now also immortal.  

I believe they may have possibly left some information out, but this is the truth that I know so far. You may have to wait until the full moon passes through your zodiac sign. You also might have to do the Wim Hoff miracle breathing technique regularly while meditating on your chakras. And they may have left out important information about Venus, but I am not sure.  ",4,1770085221.0,SacredGeometry,14,0.63,False

“America runs on Dunkin.” “I’m a Mac.” “Open happiness.”

This equates to:  *be a bit emotionally attached to this thing, every day.*

So when the “**thing**” can finally **talk back** (4o, Claude, Grok, etc.), it’s not surprising that some people slide straight from *tool* into *relationship*. Losing a model starts to feel less like “they changed the app” and more like a **breakup**.

I’m not here to clown anyone for feeling that. *I’ve lost threads and models I was attached to too*. I just think it’s worth asking what’s actually going on between us and our tools.

# 	•Where’s the line for you between “I really like this model” and “I need this model to feel okay”?

	•Before AI, did you ever have a “relationship” with a brand or product (coffee chains, phones, games) that felt a little too deep?

1qufd4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuittingZyn/comments/1qufd4z/5th_time_quitting/,5th time quitting,"So essentially I've been buying $18 packs of Canadian version of Zyn's  roughly every 3 days for the last 3 years. It was initially my way to quit vaping which I did for about 2 years, but of course... became it's own addiction

As the title says, I've quit around 5 times and I can't even last more than a month.

Every time I quit, it's like

day 1: bad anxiety, headache, tired and bad mood

day 2: 30% better

day 3: I go through this amazing period of euphoria. Productivity shoots up, I'm already glowing a bit, I get in this hopeful mood

day 4: I'm usually eating 90% of the day. I have to eat mints, seeds, etc.

day 5: My brains starts chiming in with reminders of how good nicotine would be and I go grab a coffee to stimulate myself

day 6: Every day beyond is like constant food and mint coping and less and less addictive conversations

and then as I become more and more human again, my brain decides to go into ""I'm bored"" mode. Where everything is going to be so lame without a pack of zyn's.

Urges come out at times where I'm either driving to work about to have a really busy and stressful day, or maybe the weekend hits and and my brain is like ""FRIDAY! TIME TO HAVE FUN"".

  
that's where I break every time

so anyways... this time I got a pack of 2mg nic gum,

(the zyn's were 4mg and gave me a buzz) these 2mg gum barely hit me and kinda just level me in emergencies when cravings are about to make me go get a pack of Zyns

 it's day 5 and I've taken 2 a day at most. It 100% beats me having pouches in ALL day. I'm thinking of incorporating something to occupy my boredom with my hands too like...FÜM

  
because my addiction is like 50% vape and 50% zyns

Let me know if anyone has had experience with something similar to FÜM

and wish me luck! 

lol I know this all sounds crazy but so is trying to quit something for the 5th time... -.-
