1jsiabu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jsiabu/i_feel_like_my_whole_world_is_off_and_i_dont_know/,I feel like my whole world is off and I don't know why,"Dad just sat and cried.  He cried for three whole days.  His face was blotchy and his eyes were red, he cried so hard he didn't even notice when I was in the room with him. It was honestly pathetic, seeing a grown man cry that hard. 

What had even happened? Nothing warrants that much of a reaction. At first I thought it was the car crash, sorry about that, but he'd just gotten it fixed, he didn't even make that big of a deal out of it, he threw me a hell of a cold shoulder though. Then one day, he just started crying.

It started with a phone call, I was watching TV when it happened, he seemed well enough. He mumbled a few half coherent things into the phone speaker, then gently put it down. He slowly made his way to the kitchen, calmly pulled out a glass, poured himself a cup of water. Then he threw it against the wall. I flinch. He yells louder than I've ever heard him yell. I flinch even harder. 

‚ÄúDad? Are you ok?‚Äù I ask, I've never seen him lash out like that.

He ignored me and kept crying.

‚ÄúDad this isn't funny, what the hell happened?‚Äù 

Nothing.

‚ÄúOK I get it, you're mad about the car, but it's enough with the silent treatment come on.‚Äù 

Nada.

OK fine I guess, he wants to play that game, I'll play along. I turn the TV off and head up to my room, I had fully planned on staying there for the rest of the day, I really did, but my dad just kept crying. It wouldn't stop. I slowly inch my way down off my bed and head towards my father's room. The door was closed, so I slowly turn the handle, only to find it locked. What the hell? He never locks his doors, ever. I try the handle again but it just seems like the door will never budge. I leave it and head down towards the kitchen. I haven't eaten in ages, how do I not feel hungry at all? 

I grab a glass of water, not really thirsty, just needing something to do with my hands. The house feels too quiet, like all the sound has been swallowed up, leaving only my dad‚Äôs sobs behind. I take a few sips, but the water tastes flat, not quite right. I put the glass down and look out the window, the night stretching out endlessly.

A car drives by, its headlights cutting through the darkness for a brief moment. I feel disconnected, like I‚Äôm watching everything from a distance. I don‚Äôt know why, but I can‚Äôt seem to shake the feeling that something is deeply wrong, something more than just my dad‚Äôs weirdo. I feel light, like I could drift away if I wasn‚Äôt careful.

I turn away from the window, heading back to the couch. The TV is still on, playing some late-night rerun of a show I‚Äôve seen a thousand times. I grab the remote and turn up the volume, trying to drown out the crying, trying to fill the space with something familiar. But even the bright, flickering images don‚Äôt reach me. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching through a fog.

I check my phone. No messages. Not from my friends, not from anyone. The group chat is silent. It's been like that for a while now, ever since the crash I guess. I hadn't bothered to go to school, I thought since my dad's so angry, I'll give him something to be angry about. I start to type out a text, asking if anyone wants to hang out tomorrow, but halfway through, I stop. What‚Äôs the point? No one‚Äôs answered me all week. I toss the phone onto the coffee table and lean back into the couch, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Time passes slowly. I don‚Äôt know how long I sat there, but eventually, I heard movement upstairs again. My dad, pacing. His footsteps are heavy, uneven, like he‚Äôs dragging himself around. For a moment, I think about going up there, about knocking on his door again. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to move. What would I even say?

He hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since that phone call. He hasn‚Äôt acknowledged me at all. Not really.

The clock ticks past 2 a.m. My eyes feel heavy, but I can‚Äôt sleep. The house is too cold, too quiet, and every time I close my eyes, I hear my dad‚Äôs sobs going back and forth. I wrap myself in a blanket and curl up on the couch, hoping that sleep will eventually take over. Maybe things will be better in the morning.

But morning never seems to come.

I‚Äôm still lying on the couch when the sun starts to rise, its pale light creeping through the windows. The house is eerily still now. Dad‚Äôs pacing has stopped. No more sobbing. Just silence.

I sit up, my body stiff from lying in the same position all night. I feel drained, like I haven‚Äôt slept at all. I check my phone again. Nothing. I don‚Äôt know why, but the emptiness of it feels like a punch to the gut. I glance at the stairs, wondering if I should check on Dad, but something in me resists. I‚Äôm too tired to deal with him right now, too worn out from everything. Maybe he‚Äôs finally asleep.

I grab my jacket and decide to go for a walk, hoping the fresh air will clear my head. As I step outside, the cool morning air hits my face, and for the first time in what feels like days, I feel awake. The neighborhood is quiet, the streets empty. I walk down the sidewalk, my feet moving on autopilot, taking me toward the park at the end of the street.

When I get there, I sit on one of the swings, letting my legs dangle as I look out at the empty playground. It‚Äôs strange being here alone. I used to come here with my friends all the time, but now it feels deserted, like everyone‚Äôs moved on without me. I pull out my phone again, scrolling through old photos, looking at pictures of me and Sarah, of the group laughing, hanging out at the park, at school, at parties.

I try to remember the last time I saw them. Was it last week? Last month? It‚Äôs all starting to blur together. I feel like I‚Äôve been drifting through the days, not really connected to anything or anyone.

I start swinging slowly, the chain creaking with each movement. The sky is turning a soft blue, the sun rising higher, but it still feels like it‚Äôs the middle of the night. Like time hasn‚Äôt moved at all.

After what feels like forever, I head back home. The house is exactly the same as I left it. Silent. Cold. I step inside, expecting to hear Dad, but there‚Äôs nothing. I glance at his door, still closed, and head back downstairs.

I sit on the couch, staring at the blank TV screen, feeling the weight of the day pressing down on me. The sun is fully up now, light streaming through the windows, but the house is still dark, like the light can‚Äôt quite reach inside.

I grab my phone again, scrolling through the same messages, the same photos, over and over. Waiting. But nothing changes. No one texts back. No one calls. It‚Äôs just me.

Hours pass. The sun moves across the sky, casting long shadows through the living room. I try to watch TV, but I can‚Äôt focus. I try to eat, but the food tastes like nothing. I try to sleep, but my mind won‚Äôt stop spinning. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in place, watching the world move on without me.

And all the while, Dad is still upstairs. Silent.

By the time the sun starts to set, I‚Äôve given up on trying to make sense of any of it. I go back to my room, pulling the covers over my head, trying to block everything out. The darkness feels comforting, like I could disappear into it. Maybe tomorrow will be different. Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll feel‚Ä¶ real again.

But tomorrow comes, and it‚Äôs the same. And the next day. And the next.

I never leave the house anymore. I barely even leave my room. Dad never speaks. The messages never come.

It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve slipped into some kind of in-between place, where time doesn‚Äôt matter, where the world moves on without me.

And I‚Äôm still here, waiting.

But for what, I don‚Äôt know.

1jsi9rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1jsi9rt/austin_cafes_similar_to_empire_in_houston/,Austin Cafes Similar to Empire in Houston,"Hi there, Austin subreddit. This is going to be a very niche question, I think, but here we go anyway. 

My wife and I moved here from Houston a few years ago and while we have found a whole lot to love about Austin there is one particular thing we're still looking for. There's a restaurant in Houston (on Westheimer in Montrose) called Empire Cafe that has a rotating assortment of amazing cakes sold by the slice. 

They also do fancy coffee and cocktails, and there's a full menu of nice appetizers and entrees. Slightly floofy elevated American and Italian dishes mostly. Relaxed, casual, slightly hip atmosphere. It's all good, but the cake is the thing you go there for.

And I knows Austin's got some very nice bakeries, but is there a place here in town that sounds similar to Empire, to anyone? Or, longer shot, can anyone here who has been to Empire make a suggestion?

Any recommendations would be welcome and greatly appreciated. Thank you, fellow Austin reddit people!",1,1743900724.0,Austin,1,1.0,False

I summarized some of the tricks I used during interviews and applied them consistently in the end. One of my recruiters even said that my performance and communication style impressed him, which proved that these methods were super useful. Here are my tricks that helped me improve my prep quality:

**Start with small talk**: It helps me relax and get into the right mindset and it leaves HR with a friendly impression. I usually start by asking where they are and how the weather is, and what I‚Äôve been up to recently.

**Use the Q&A session to sell myself again**: I usually say something like: ""I know this is a very competitive position. I‚Äôd love to know what qualities you value most in a candidate."" Based on the HR‚Äôs answer, I will summarize and highlight my strengths again to reinforce my impression. I also proactively ask about the next steps to express my strong interest in the role.

**Research HR in advance**: Before interviews, I usually search for the HR‚Äôs profile on LinkedIn to prepare targeted questions for the Q&A session and show my interest. If I notice they‚Äôve been with the company for a long time, I‚Äôll casually mention it: ""I noticed you‚Äôve been with the company for quite a while, which shows great commitment. Could you share what you like most about working here?""

**Make your experience audience-friendly**: Most HR don't have tech background, so it‚Äôs important to explain my work in a way they can understand. I generally write out my example and let ChatGPT rephrase it to be friendly for non-technical audiences.

**Connect with alumni from the company as soon as you get the interview**: This is the most efficient way to quickly learn about the company. When connecting with alumni, don‚Äôt immediately jump into asking for a coffee chat, ask them about the interview process and what they like most about working at the company.

**Show your understanding of the company during the interview**:Let the HR or hiring manager know that you‚Äôve done your homework for this interview. Prepare an example in advance that strongly connects the company‚Äôs culture, outlook, or business with your personality or experience.

**Prepare a work sample related to the company**: It‚Äôs a good chance to showcase your execution skills and capabilities. Make the HR or hiring manager feel valued and respected.

**Maximize free resources**: Generate answers tailored to my resumes, questions, and specific roles: ChatGPT; Question prediction based on job roles and real question banks: AMA Interview; Practice for coding interviews and system design: Educative; Data techniques, the latest reports, and supplemental learning: DataCamp",2,1743900577.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

1jsi6jm,https://i.redd.it/fcj3xlhc34te1.jpeg,"A*Men kryptomint ,by Mugler review.","Scent : 8.3/10 the scent itself is nice. It wasn‚Äôt the artificial mint/mint chocolate chip I‚Äôve read about(a bit disappointed), but a subtle fresh mint leaf in the spring time. Not really picking up on any , chocolate or coffee, but get a hint of vanilla. If I had to describe it id say it‚Äôs mint with a hint of fresh flowers. The scent isnt very strong, definitely on the more subtle side. 


Average longevity, 4-6 hours. 


Atomizer: 4/10 not a fan of the atomizer. The spray itself is weak if that makes sense. Maybe I don‚Äôt have the technique down yet, but you have to get the right squeeze for a good spray. . I thought you could take the cap off, but I am not able to. 


Look/design: 6/10 I love the color of the bottle, but it‚Äôs a bit too flashy for me, although this doesn‚Äôt really matter. 

Overall, not worth the premium price IMO. The scent is nice for a casual day, but I also wouldn‚Äôt mind using it on a small date or something.  My search for a minty fragrance continues.

1jsi5u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jsi5u4/so_much_ambiguity_after_our_breakup/,So much ambiguity after our breakup,"I really just need to rant. Outside perspectives are appreciated. 

TLDR: Ex broke up with me after multiple years and will leave the country soon. For now we have some weird ambiguous connection where her words don‚Äôt match her actions.

My now ex broke up with me (both in our early twenties) a couple of months ago. This is after being in a relationship and living together for multiple years. She even moved countries to live with me.

Even though I felt like I got blindsided, after some time I better understood this was has been lingering for a while. Some tensions existed for sure but nothing fundamental I thought. She had mentioned to me she was feeling homesick to her country of origin. I had always expressed how I did not want to move there with her. Not in a ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather break up than consider it‚Äù type of way. To me it never felt like a serious consideration, at least at the moment.  We were both still in school and slowly setting our roots here.

Then, what to me felt like suddenly, she said she intended on moving back to her home country. I said I would actually want to come with her instead of losing her. She replied with uncertainty.

She spent a month in her home county to ‚Äúthink about things‚Äù. When she came back she did not have a straight answer for me. To prevent this post from becoming longer than the bible I am gonna keep this short.I decided to just live with the ambiguity. We actually ended up having some of the best two weeks together in a long time. Then I felt her pulling away again. She felt like she did not see a future with me. She couldn‚Äôt tell me anything fundamentally wrong. She just felt like this was necessary or whatever. All the cliches. We considered the idea of her staying in our apartment until she flew home in a few months. Finding a place for such short notice would be too hard.

Then I noticed her interacting with some other guy on her phone. Nothing too heartbreaking but definitely flirty. I confronted her and obviously things went south. Anger sadness you get it. It was explained away as meaningless and that she definitely wouldn‚Äôt be with anyone for a very long time. I think I believe her. She left and stayed with a friend.

In the following period we stayed in very frequent contact. I know a clean cut is best but we have always been so close it just felt unnatural not to. I‚Äôll summarize it as a lot of hot and cold behavior from her side including real intimacy and short no contact periods eventually led me to writing her a long letter. 

I tried to explain how I recognized the way in which I was flawed and how I would be better. There was a lot to it but you get the gist. I asked if she truly saw no way to work out what didn‚Äôt work and how to improve.
I ended with the message that this dynamic we were having was unsustainable to me. That I needed her to open up to having that conversation with me or to just stop talking.

She replied saying she truly appreciated my vulnerability but that she was absolutely certain that friendship is all she wants right now. It was clear enough that that was not going to work so we broke contact again.

Lasted maybe 5 days this time?
‚ÄúIt does suck not to talk‚Äù
‚ÄúI do miss hearing from you‚Äù
‚ÄúHow about we just keep it casual‚Äù

And soon enough we‚Äôre hanging out again. This time she is clear about her boundaries. I realize I‚Äôm just working against myself here but she has always been my closest friend. and even though it felt near impossible emotionally I didn‚Äôt want to lose that bond entirely.

At one point we decided to get a drink together. Eventually we kissed. There was much more tension between us but we decided in that moment it would be best not to and go our separate ways that night. 

We didn‚Äôt really speak of it the next day. Day after i ask about it. She responds with regret for playing with my emotions and excuses of alcohol. Fine. Back to friendship

We don‚Äôt talk much for a week or two. We get coffee a few times but it‚Äôs strange. 

Eventually she had to come by to my place to pick up some of her old things. I‚Äôm not sure what changed but we managed to have a pretty good conversation. We did not go into breakup specifics but we talked about attachment styles (she said she discovered she is fearful avoidant) and this is the first time she somewhat engaged with my attempts at sharing new perspectives I have on what went wrong. She reassured me the fault wasn‚Äôt mine. 

We suggested spending a full day together soon because the dynamic felt good. I excitedly said I would plan something for us.

I planned a very romantic day for us. Curating it perfectly to what she would like best. It clearly did something because only after a few hours she said she kinda wanted to kiss me again. I decided it would probably be best not to complicate things. We did end up kissing a few times later that day and I ended up sleeping at her new place, even though nothing happened. To me it felt good.

This was a not too long ago. We have been seeing each other a lot since but the weird ambiguity is completely back. She even suggested that wanting to kiss the other day was once again alcohol influenced. This is complete nonsense since we didn‚Äôt drink anything up to that point. I just don‚Äôt get it?

I know I have already let this go on for much too long and I should just chose my own peace instead of chasing something so blurry and probably not even real. Perhaps I am crazy but I just keep seeing these signals that make me believe there is something worth fighting for. I sure as hell don‚Äôt want to regret not trying hard enough.

How can you say you want nothing but platonic friendship but still say you love me and kiss me when things feel romantic?

How can you say you don‚Äôt want to have a life without me but you don‚Äôt want to try and make it work?

Why set up candlelight during dinner and ask for foot rubs while watchingv our show while you say you don‚Äôt want to do couply things?

My go-to was Barista Bros, until they ceased production - now the only option with more than 150mg of caffeine I can find is Lewis Road ($$$, 250mg). The next best seems to be a soy milk, at around 150mg.

The first person I called after it happened was my old sponsor. He was already on his way to meet for coffee. The next day I'm at an AA meeting. God and AA has always been there no matter. No matter what happens. God and AA have always remained true in spite of myself. I never needed to leave and I'm so grateful to be back into the fold. I didn't relapse, but the fact that I stopped going to AA for a year and half is wild and I'm so grateful for the program and the life it has given me.

1jshv6q,https://i.redd.it/f31op5rb04te1.png,Should Meta Runner Continue as Comic Book?,"That's my Question and an updated version of a previous thread 

I always thought would be cool to see what happens next however since there's a chance we might never get season 4 would be cool to continue the story in Comic form you know yeah Glitch made one-shot but it never went anywhere I like to see done by professionals that are fans of the Series or at least fans of Video games

My top 3 picks for publisher would be IDW, Dynamite Entertainment or Skybound/Image Comics

My idea is start with an issue #0 with Tari and Theo going into a server that has doors based on many titles from the publisher like if it's Skybound/Image Comics she would meet Invincible then the Cast from Walking Dead and Fire Power then meets Optimus Prime possibly(because of the Energon Universe) then goes to possibly world of other Image Comics titles then it ends setting up issue #1 and the first actual issue

if it's IDW It's mostly same thing basically the same thing she meets the Ninja Turtles, SONIC then cast of the main Star Terk comic and The Rocketeer

The opening arc would be set a year after the Series Finale and stuff happens Tari knows she has to warn her friends and the world and it's something and that is just the opening arc there's like an filler issue or issues in between that just few days with Tari and the Rest just chilling we see her getting coffee and a girls night out and reading a comic book and starting a duck collection like those relaxing issues between Arcs stuff they couldn't do in the show at least not much 

And few spin-off comics one based on collage Runner spin-off Luke and Kevin had as comic book miniseries 

My vision for a the creative team would be Ryan North(Dinosaur Comics, Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, Fantastic Four and STAR TREK: Lower Decks) with art by Rachel Stott(Super Girl, Fantastic Four, Supergirl) with guest artist drawing te video game Tari Warping  into to make feel like it's  own world with a backup story also written by Ryan North and art by Sarah Myer(Saturday Morning Ninja Turtles Adventure) which is comic sequel to Theo spin-off pilot it basically starts where it left off with Kevin and Luke acting as Consultants to who ever writing the comic 

My ideal comic main Cover artist would be Phil Noto (STAR WARS, Daredevil, Avengers: The Origin) 

The first Meta Runner comic Glitch release would be re released by Publisher as issue #0 with bonus story by creative team of Comic 

Don't you think that would be cool? I do Specially with the right Writer and Artist on it also Cover Artist

Plus the potential for many spin-off comics just think about it cool right?

But me how you vision a Meta Runner continuation Comic? I also like idea of GLITCH doing comics based on there shows

## Features and Benefits: Why Choose a Breville Double Boiler?

The Breville Double Boiler offers a compelling array of features and benefits that make it a popular choice among coffee enthusiasts:

## Breville Double Boiler vs.the Competition: Making the Right Choice

While the Breville Double Boiler is a highly regarded espresso machine, it's essential to compare it with other popular models to determine if it's the right fit for your needs and budget.

*   **Breville Double Boiler vs. Gaggia Classic Pro:** The Gaggia classic Pro is a well-regarded entry-level espresso machine known for its simplicity and affordability. However, it lacks the dual boiler system and advanced temperature control of the Breville Double Boiler. If you're looking for precise temperature control and the ability to brew and steam simultaneously, the Breville is the clear winner.

*   **Breville Double Boiler vs. Rancilio Silvia:** The Rancilio Silvia is another popular single-boiler machine favored by experienced espresso enthusiasts. It's known for its robust construction and ability to produce excellent espresso. However, similar to the Gaggia Classic Pro, it lacks the convenience and consistency of the Breville Double Boiler's dual boiler system and PID control.

*   **Breville Double Boiler vs.rocket Appartamento:** The Rocket appartamento is a higher-end espresso machine known for its lovely design and exceptional build quality. While it doesn't have a double boiler in the same sense as the Breville, it uses a heat exchanger system that allows for simultaneous brewing and steaming. The Rocket Appartamento is typically more expensive than the Breville Double Boiler and requires more experience to operate effectively.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you prioritize precise temperature control, consistent performance, and ease of use, the Breville Double Boiler is an excellent option. however, if you're on a tighter budget or prefer a more hands-on espresso-making experience, the Gaggio Classic Pro or Rancilio Silvia might be better choices. For those willing to invest in a higher-end machine with exceptional aesthetics, the Rocket Appartamento is worth considering.

*   **Water Filters:** Regularly replacing the water filters is crucial for preventing scale buildup and maintaining optimal water quality.

1jshj0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/1jshj0o/rum_newcomer_rates_40_rums/,Rum Newcomer Rates 40 Rums,"Hi everyone. I only started drinking rum properly last year, and recently I wanted to broaden my experiences. Until recently, I've only experienced what was available from supermarkets (UK) and wanted to expand the range I've tried. Around 1-2 months ago a friend introduced me to Master of Malt. Well that spiralled out of control fast when I found out I could get 3cl samples, the hunt for my favourite rums began. In order to try be as objective as possible, I recorded my ratings in an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of what I thought of each rum I've tried. Just finished my 40th rum label, and thought it might be of interest to others what I thought trying that many in a short period of time as a relative newcomer was like.

# How did I test?

As I only had a 3cl bottle for the vast majority of rums, I needed a short and consistent testing process. Due to how little I had to work with, rating each rum in how they worked in cocktails was out of the question. So testing and rating was broken down into 3 steps:

1. Empty 3cl sample into glass, and try a couple sips neat for initial neat rating.
2. Add a couple of ice cubes, and try a couple sips with the ice to see if it changes my neat rating.
3. Add Pepsi Max to the same glass and try mixed for a mixed rating.

8 of the 40 rums broke this process, as I had an actual full 500ml to 1000ml bottle to try, which meant I could go back multiple times and adjust how I felt about them.

A rum was rated on a scale of 1 to 10.

The majority of the rums came from sets of pre-picked rum samples by Master of Malt, the majority of which were completely random.

# What was recorded in the spreadsheet?

The primary spreadsheet was broken down into the following columns: Brand, Label, Type, Country, Vol%, Bottle Size, Bottle Cost ¬£, Store Cost ¬£ From, Cost per L, Neat Rating, Neat Log Rating, Neat Opinion, Neat Rating Per ¬£, Mixed Rating, Mixed Log Rating, Mixed Opinion, Mixed Rating Per ¬£, Average Rating Per ¬£, Average Log Rating.

The ""Log Rating"" columns require a little explanation. These were calculated columns based on the numerical rating and the ¬£ cost per L, to work out what the best value for money rums were. However one rum broke the ratings, where I'd rated it low however due to how cheap it was it broke into the top 5 of each rating per ¬£ scoreboard. To combat this I used a logarithmic function in excel to help mitigate very low rated rums with very low cost. The log rating was calculated as ""LOG(NumRating, Cost¬£PerL)\*100"". The cost per L had to be the base of the log function to stop one rum (that I'd rated 1/10) from breaking the function. When it came to the average log rating, this was ""LOG(AVERAGE(NeatRating, MixedRating),CostPerL)\*100"". Multiplying by 100 was just to make numbers a bit more readable in the spreadsheet as scores were to 2 decimal places.

Costs for bottles are taken from Tesco as it's a popular supermarket that's widely available (if they sell it), or from Master of Malt (for pricing consistency). If a bottle was available in multiple sizes, the 700ml option was the default pricing pick.

# My thoughts and opinions on the rums I've tried

I was really interested to see what my favourite rums were, and also to try work out if I'd buy a bottle of it. My biggest regret was the Project #173 sampler set, I hated basically all of them. They were all so incredibly one dimensional, and were completely outperformed by basically any other rum. I've also never had anything as nasty as that Smoked Chilli one.

I can't get enough of the Chairman's Reserve Spiced, it is by far my favourite spiced rum for a spiced rum and coke. It's a permanent resident in my collection. I don't think I could ever mistake the smell of this for anything else. I'll probably eventually get a bottle of the Original or the Forgotten Casks, but I'm wanting to try more rums before picking one up. A rum I was disappointed in considering how much I enjoyed Chairman's, was Bounty Gold Rum despite being from Saint Lucia Distillers as well.

My sister and brother in law are massive Bumbu fans. When I finally got around to trying it, it had far too much sugar for my liking, I'd never buy a full bottle. However when I tried the Don Q spiced, I found it to have the same flavours profiles, but infinitely more enjoyable, one I might actually pick up a bottle of. I'm also hoping to try the Don Q Reserva 7.

I'd like to try more of the Plantery rums, I really enjoyed the XO. I was however confused by Plantery Pineapple Stiggins' Fancy. It's listed as a ""flavoured"" rum, but I really struggled to taste any pineapple, it really caught me off guard.

I wasn't expecting to rate Rumbullion! XO 15 so high, as I had tried it after having had the regular Rumbullion. The normal Rumbullion! was rated really high on Master of Malt, however when I tried it I really couldn't vibe with it. All I could taste was the overwhelming flavour of cardamon and cloves. The XO 15 had none of that. If it ever took my fancy to try the normal again, I'd maybe experiment with something involving apples as odd as that might sound. My partner likes cardamon tea, and I remember once her giving me some while I was eating an apple. The flavour combo of the two worked really well.

Pusser's Gunpowder Proof Black Label was quite nice, however despite that I don't think I could support them after hearing the controversy.

I was hoping to enjoy Appleton Estate Signature more than I did. This one is normally recommended a lot online as a way to get into non-spiced rums, but it didn't impress me, it also didn't offend me either. However from some of the other rums I've tried, I have noticed that rums that have been aged more sit well with me, so I'll be sure to try their other options.

In terms of scoring, most rums scored higher when mixed as it would usually hide certain elements I didn't like, however some rums actually scored the same or lower mixed as I felt that when they were mixed they lost too much of their personality. Chairman's Forgotten Casks, Ron Abuelo 12, and Rumbullion XO being some of them. I also felt some rums would ideally be in a cocktail, however for the ability to test I couldn't. The white rums were the main ones I felt this way about.

A feel like an honourable mention should be the Tanduay Double Rum. Neat it tasted almost charred, however when it was mixed it was quite pleasant and I felt it worked really well with cola flavourings. A second mention I would give to English Harbour 5 Year. It was fairly easy to drink, felt a little thin neat, but appeared like a nice all-rounder for mixed.

A dishonourable mention has to be OVD as this rum broke my original cost per rating scores because it's so unbelievably cheap and was the reason I had to use a log function. This rum is available in 1L bottles, and comes in at ¬£27.50 per L when not on offer at supermarkets. In comparison, Rumbullion XO is ¬£133.90 per L. It's the cost per L that caused Bacardi Spiced to appear in all 3 top valued scoreboards. It too is available in 1L bottles at ¬£24.25 per L, and at the time of writing this it's on offer at ¬£19 a L. However to make the scoreboard fair, I recorded it's 700ml bottle costing ¬£27.14 per L.

# What's next?

I have been on and off therapy for the last 10y. The last 2 years I have been doing EMDR and it has really been the most beneficial for me, and I‚Äôve seen some great results. But‚Ä¶ it is starting to feel like a cycle? 

I go through good times where I feel like I‚Äôm making great strides and process, and then after a session I am so defeated and so exhausted that I am taken back to day 1. The coping mechanism, the growth, the hope I have - all gone. And I start building and working on it all over again to build myself up, and then it comes back down when a trigger undoes me and I work away at it. 

I can see the progress, I can see there‚Äôs improvement, and I can see that value in this.. but I am so exhausted. 

The thought of having to feel all this, work on all this again on repeat to just be able to function in a very basic way really just overwhelms me. It will get better, it will get easier - but will it ever just be okay? Will I ever just get to exist without constantly mimicking my abusers words and punishment? Without shame or guilt? Without fear and sadness? 

All this work for something that happened to me - for something I never got to run away from or make a choice about. It just feels so defeating and exhausting and unfair 

Also I think I‚Äôm just envious? I envy the people that get to wake up without a debilitating round of self hatred and limitation on themselves before a morning coffee. I‚Äôm envious of people who don‚Äôt over analyse every single interaction, room, person or memory. I am envious of people who knew what it felt like to have love and a hug as a child. I am envious of people who get to be intimate and close and not feel disgust and hatred. 

(I will keep continuing, I have come such a far way, I‚Äôm not in a frozen state and am safe and getting on with life and will keep pushing - will talk to my therapist about all these feelings and thoughts - just need to vent this one out)

My friend seems to have made some positive changes but made some negative changes and I want to look out for him.

First I've known him since middle school, and he has OCD. From like 20 to 25 he had a mental health spiral with OCD and would barely leave the house, didn't work or go to school but he helped around the house and made some money selling stuff on Etsy and spent most of his time with his family. I tried to visit as much as possible but he didn't want to very often maybe every few months.

He got some treatment and made some good changes when he turned 26. Got his first job, started socializing and going out again, made some friends and we got to hangout again, started dating, saving up money etc.

But I also noticed some negative changes that maybe I should worry about. He started hoarding and picking his skin very badly and gained a lot of weight. went to therapy for hoarding but stopped and got worse. He also started drinking massive amounts of coffee and he's the type of guy that wouldn't even take aspirin. I also heard from his brother that he would sleep like 12+ hours a day and wouldn't do anymore chores and always seemed irritated. He also told me he would barely be at home and tried to date a girl already in a relationship.

I noticed also that he would spend less and less time with our friend group and it seems like he lost all interest in his old hobbies and only shows interest in stuff his GF likes to do. I know this is normal but to what extent?

Anyways he's been with her 5 months and said he was thinking he'd probably want to marry her. After 6 months they look for an apartment and after 8 months they find a place and move in together and says he wants to start as family. He said he feels like he's getting too old for kids because his parents were 22 when they had kids. I don't know if he's actually going to try to get her pregnant right away. Also didnt tell his family or any of his friends about the move. I've only met his GF like 5 times and his family didn't meet her at all.

I haven't really said anything other than make sure to take the time to really know she is the one, but I feel like he's having a quarter life crisis and isnt thinking rationally and is going to make a mistake that will bite him in the ass later on, but I do hope things work out with them since he's happy with her.",1,1743897426.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

I'm a 51 yo woman who gave up all coffee/caffeine, cold turkey, almost 2 weeks ago. I had been drinking a heavy daily amount for 35 years! Very rough first few days, but immediately, starting on day 4, got progressively better feeling. Feeling absolutely amazing at this point! I was, and still am, surprised how quickly I've recovered after doing this for my entire adult life.

I hadn't had a period in 6 months and I assumed I was about to go into menopause because of it. I've had a very traumatic past couple of years (unexpected death of a child and another child who had a stroke) and assumed the grief was hastening the aging process along. I really feel it did.

Well a few days ago I started having mild pms symptoms and I just started my period. I have a good friend who is a functional medicine nurse practitioner. She said it *could* just be coincidence *OR* there is a good chance that giving up all caffeine drastically dropped the various circulating stress hormones I've had going 24/7, essentially regulating my system in a very brief time. I was surprised by how good I felt on day 4, 5, 6, on.

So who really knows. But it does make me wonder if anyone has had a similar experience?

Also wanted to add that I wish I had been caffeine free for the past few years. Yes, the grief would have still been there, but maybe my system wouldn't have been as taxed and I could have handled it better.",4,1743897032.0,decaf,6,1.0,False

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm about to drop some seriously exciting news. For the past couple of months, I‚Äôve been diving headfirst into a game project that‚Äôs been brewing in my brain for a while. It‚Äôs a blend of world-building, character creation, and enough creativity to make your head spin. I‚Äôm talking about a game that‚Äôs fueled by some serious passion‚Äîone that‚Äôs gonna have more layers than your grandma‚Äôs lasagna (and trust me, that‚Äôs a lot of layers). Right now, I‚Äôve designed 80+ characters, but the grand finale is going to be 106. Yeah, I‚Äôm going big or going home. Why stop at a cool 100 when you can hit a whole new level?

Each character is completely unique. And no, they‚Äôre not just cookie-cutter heroes (I mean, have you seen the state of the cookie aisle these days? Yikes). These guys are based on twisted versions of classic fairy tales, folklore, and mythology. So if you came looking for sparkles and sunshine, you might want to hit the back button. These characters have grit, depth, and some backstories darker than your coffee on a Monday morning. And I‚Äôm not just throwing powers around willy-nilly either. Every element, every weapon, every little thing is designed to click, to matter. You‚Äôre not just picking a character; you‚Äôre diving into a world where your choices actually have weight.

Speaking of weight... Let's talk about the world. It‚Äôs divided into seven elements (yes, seven, because we don‚Äôt do things halfway here). These elements are the foundation of the regions, influencing everything from the weather to the people‚Äôs culture. And don‚Äôt get me started on the landscapes‚Äîthe environments will change depending on the element you‚Äôre in. Fire? Get ready for lava and sizzling landscapes. Water and ice? Prepare for a cold front that‚Äôs got you wishing for a heated blanket. And of course, the five weapon types are here to make sure that you‚Äôve got the right tools for the job‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre fighting with a sword, guns, shield, or some other cool tech (who knows, maybe stealth ninja gear will be an option someday...).

Now let‚Äôs talk roles‚Äîthere‚Äôs no need for just one-size-fits-all here. We‚Äôve got Warriors (DPS), Vanguards (Tanks), and Mystics (Support). The Warriors are your damage-dealing heroes, swinging swords (or guns or fists) with all the finesse of a knight with a bad attitude. Vanguards are your tanks, standing strong like a wall of bricks‚Äîbut, you know, the kind that‚Äôs still kinda cool. Mystics, meanwhile, are the support characters, helping their team through buffs, healing, and some good ol‚Äô fashioned magic. But just because they‚Äôre ""support"" doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre boring. Think of them as the unsung heroes who are one healing spell away from saving your skin when you‚Äôre about to go down in flames.

And of course, we can‚Äôt forget about Lyssandra Marlowe‚Äîshe‚Äôs like the cherry on top of a very complex, multi-layered dessert. Not only is she my personal favorite character so far, but her design is seriously next-level. Lyssandra‚Äôs inspired by The Little Mermaid, but not in the ‚Äúsinging and dancing with seagulls‚Äù way. She‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúfighting back against a life of privilege and finding her voice in more ways than one‚Äù kinda character. She wields Tide, which means she‚Äôs got water and ice powers at her disposal (because why not freeze the competition, right?). She rocks dual pistols (I mean, who needs a trident when you can just shoot them all down?), and she fills the Mystic role‚Äîso she‚Äôs not just in it for the fireworks. She‚Äôs got depth, strategy, and more emotional layers than an onion on a bad day.

But don‚Äôt let her smooth exterior fool you. Lyssandra‚Äôs got a backstory that could give Shakespeare a run for his money. Born into high society, her life was perfectly sculpted, like one of those over-the-top sculptures in rich people‚Äôs mansions that you just know costs way too much. She was the ideal noblewoman: poised, polite, and as icy as her water-based powers. But after being sold off to a creepy, power-hungry dude in a forced engagement, she said, ‚Äúnah,‚Äù and ghosted her family‚Äîliterally. Her voice? Gone. Just disappeared after a deal with a mysterious figure. And now, she‚Äôs living her life as a silent storm‚Äîdismantling the corrupt nobility, one perfectly-timed bullet at a time.

She‚Äôs now a legend‚Äîan unstoppable force of vengeance‚Äîand I‚Äôm not just talking about her side-eye. Lyssandra‚Äôs quiet, calculating, and has a heart colder than a penguin‚Äôs dance moves. And when she steps into a room? Let‚Äôs just say you‚Äôd better check your privilege (or else it‚Äôll be the last thing you do). She‚Äôs one tempest you don‚Äôt want to cross.

But let‚Äôs not forget about the rest of the characters! I‚Äôm designing tons more, with over 200 items already in the works (because who doesn‚Äôt need 200 ways to smack someone with style?). The characters will each bring something unique to the table, and by the time we hit 106 total, this game is going to be packed with more personality than an entire season of a reality show. That‚Äôs right, 106‚Äîbecause I don‚Äôt settle for almost perfect. Why be good when you can be unbeatable?

Right now, we‚Äôre in the conceptual phase, so the story and character designs are still being refined. I haven‚Äôt gotten into coding or art yet (except for some rough pixel art, which trust me, looks way cooler than it sounds). The next steps are making sure each character is solid, refining the story, and eventually turning this thing into something real. It‚Äôs going to be a long journey, but I‚Äôm seriously hyped to see where it goes.

So there you have it! Stay tuned for more updates as things progress‚Äîand remember, the next time you level up, you can thank me for getting you through all those pun-ishing moments. Get it? Pun-ishing? Ugh, I need a nap.

Thanks for reading‚Äîkeep your swords sharp and your puns sharper! If you have any comments, feel free. Anything is wlecome!

I went for my morning walk which gets me around 9,500 steps on the days I don't go to the gym. I came back home, had a chobani yogurt, cinnamon bread slice, and carrots with guac (I've been loving this combo for some reason.) 

For brunch I had BLT eggs Benedict and a half of biscuits and gravy with an iced coffee. 

I just had dinner. I was just going to do a salad but ended up not doing that and decided to snack. I had a bag of portioned pirates booty, carrots and guac, another slice of cinnamon bread, and made good granola balls.

She is universally agreed to be gorgeous in a conventional sense, while I have some striking features (height, facial hair, smile, etc.) but am slightly stocky and consider myself average-looking - although I've worked on myself for some time and feel a lot more confident than when the two of us last met in person. I am also completely inexperienced when it comes to relationships and have only been on a few dates, although I am usually closer to my women friends than male friends.

We've known each other as friends for two years and I lived in her country until last year. We lived on opposite sides of her country and my mental health wasn't great then (which she noticed), so it was a relatively low-level friendship although I did value her company. After I left her country, we kept in touch, but I didn't develop any feelings until we started texting frequently in her language several months ago and really got to know each other. We have always had this kind of playful and witty dynamic when texting while also discussing deep or sensitive things, which is very special to me. We've discussed our romantic preferences as friends in the past - she's single and finally looking again for something long-term (like myself) after a few short-term relationships. Not too surprisingly, she appreciates confidence in men and I get the feeling that intellectual compatibility is also very important to her; I'm not very stereotypically masculine, and we really connect in this way.

We both work/study in an artistic field, we talk about beauty in art and life a lot, and we sometimes discuss a particular style that leans into a sensual and romantic direction. She is very good at conveying tone in texts - although there has been some tenderness from her side, there was nothing overtly flirty until today, when she reacted to a comment I made about this style with a biting lip emoji. As far as I know, this is as flirty as it gets, but I'm still not sure if it is 100% a sign of interest because she is just a really open person in general; on her very first coffee when we met exclusively as friends, she talked about things that she felt made her ""look sexy"" (when I thanked her for the nice time afterward, she responded that it's ""always nice to make new friends"", which was also my intention back then.)

I really like her both because she matches my intellectual curiosity like nobody else and because she's incredibly attractive, but I have misinterpreted the signs before (I once had a close friend who gave me compliments, called me a sweet person, gave lots of hugs, rested her head on my shoulder, long glances into each other's eyes, etc. and she still said she didn't see me that way when I started to flirt more) and don't want to ruin one of my most profound friendships. Would you say it's likely that she is interested, or am I reading too much into things?

(I should hopefully be in her country again this summer, and we intend to call at some point in the next few weeks when our schedules align, but it would be helpful to have an idea of where things are before then.)",1,1743896626.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

It arrived with a crack in the water reservoir and Amazon partially refunded me for the cost of acquiring a new reservoir. Come to find out, the reservoir isn‚Äôt sold on the Amazon platform and all I could find online for an OEM was through a third-party seller based in Italy on eBay.

While I wait for the next month for this OEM part to be shipped and delivered, I managed to seal the crack using JB Weld branded epoxy. I was able to dramatically reduce the rate at which water was leaking and get the machine to turn on. Then, I was able to run three rinse cycles and a full descaling cycle. Then, I tried to connect the machine to my Nespresso app, but I guess this particular model isn‚Äôt app compatible. 

So, I had to call the Nespresso support line and give them all the product information to register the machine on the app. Finally, I was able to brew a nice double shot of espresso and make an iced latte.

What advice do y‚Äôall have for operating and maintaining the machine? Anything that I should be aware of? Any and all advice welcome.",0,1743896590.0,nespresso,2,0.5,False

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_(1995_film)?wprov=sfti1) / [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113277/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) / [Official Trailer](https://youtu.be/PpAhjOvQVj0?si=HGzqF2DYIi-X7ldX) / Our Collection

IMDb Summary: A group of high-end professional thieves start to feel the heat from the LAPD when they unknowingly leave a verbal clue at their latest heist.

Starring a whole bucketful of stars including Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Tom Sizemore, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Ted Levine (yay!), Jon Voight, and Val Kilmer. 

This was one of my Dad‚Äôs favorite films. It came out on VHS not long before he passed away, and he purchased it. This was quite a big deal as he only had a couple of other tapes. He was a huge action fan and this really hit the spot for him. I was never able to watch it with him, but this film will have a place on our shelf permanently. 

This was one heck of a star-studded film, and we originally put it on to honor Val Kilmer but in the end, neither of us felt this was a large enough role for that, so, more to come. 

We have a few [Michael Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mann?wprov=sfti1#Early_life_and_education) films in our collection, though the favorite is, of course, [Band of the Hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_the_Hand?wprov=sfti1#), even though he was just an executive producer, the film is so Michael Mann. It was a gift from a friend. 

Michael Mann is all about making stuff work, even if it takes a few tries. According to the Wikipedia for the film, *Mann wrote the original script for Heat in 1979. The script was first used for a television pilot developed by Mann, which became the 1989 television film L.A. Takedown after the pilot did not receive a series order. In 1994, Mann revisited the script to turn it into a feature film.* 

Have you ever heard of a [Tree of 40 Fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_40_Fruit?wprov=sfti1#)? This film is really a Tree of 40. As is often the case when you are throwing in the whole kit and caboodle, you are going to need to make sure that you are careful to get out the unneeded extras. I can‚Äôt say I felt like it was done here. 

Zedd commented he was not sure that the time devoted to the families of the cops and robbers was worth it. I agree, but I think that they were trying to humanize both sides and get a buy-in from the audience. 

There were a few things I noticed that ‚Äúpopped my movie bubble‚Äù. I did not believe the relationship between Neil (Robert De Niro) and Eady (Amy Brenneman) - who has possibly one of the worst Southern accents ever heard. 

I know I am in the minority here, from the reviews I read, but I felt the dialogue was clunky as hell. I laughed out loud several times in the least opportune moments. These were NOT meant to be funny. 

Remember the Tree of 40 fruits? What is not mentioned at all in the film plot on Wikipedia is that Waingro (Kevin Gage) is more than just a little unhinged. He is basically a serial killer in this film as he murders not just members of the crew but also sex workers. This was like a pineapple plant attached to a plum tree. It‚Äôs just not working for me. 

I also felt like the ‚Äúcoffee shop scene‚Äù was absolutely unlikely. But it happened folks. *Adamson and McCauley met for coffee once, as portrayed in the film.Their dialogue in the script is based on the conversation that McCauley and Adamson had.The next time that the two met, guns were drawn, which is also mirrored in the movie.* So, hey, I was wrong. 

I just have to remind all of you that we have the ‚Äúlike what you like‚Äù rule here at 500 Movies or Bust. I know some of you just love this film. Love it, but don‚Äôt hate me because I didn‚Äôt. Hate Zedd, he liked it even less than me (just kidding.) 

I am determined to give this little flick another try in a few years, because it is a favorite of so many. I am **always** willing to change my opinion.  What is more ***Movie On*** than that? ",1,1743896527.0,500moviesorbust,0,1.0,False

When descaling the Brew+Chill, do you run the cleaning solution (or vinegar) on both the hot and cold settings? It's my understanding that in order to get chilled coffee, the coffee needs to travel through the longer tubes in the back by the chill tank to cool off, so naturally, you would need to descale on the cold setting to clean those pipes, too, if you make chilled coffee at all.... correct?

Visited Costa last week with my 10 day old baby. Went to meet my best friend and it was my first outing without my husband ( so a bit nervous!)

Sat down and we both ordered a coffee and a cake. Had a good chat and she held baby etc. about 40 mins into seating, I started to breastfeed baby. Coffee was nearly gone but cakes hadn‚Äôt been eaten yet. A member of staff came over and demanded I stop feeding my baby as it was ‚Äòtoo time consuming‚Äô and we‚Äôve been sat here for too long and it was a busy period so we need to leave. We pointed out there were over 10 empty tables and we still had cake but she ignored us and held the door open for us to leave. I was so upset and embarrassed I just stopped feeding baby and rushed out.

Last summer, my 10 year marriage ended suddenly when my husband told me he wanted out. I was completely lost my identity had been so wrapped up in being a wife and working at our joint business.

I fell into a deep depression. I couldn't sleep, my anxiety was through the roof, and I started having panic attacks for the first time in my life. I was barely functioning for my two kids, just going through the motions.

My sister convinced me to try a beginner yoga class at her local studio. I resisted for weeks I was never athletic, and the thought of being in a room full of people in my fragile state terrified me. But eventually, I gave in just to make her stop asking.

That first class was humbling. I couldn't hold a downward dog for more than 5 seconds. My balance was nonexistent. I felt awkward and out of place. But the instructor, Sarah, was incredibly kind and helped me with modifications.

What kept me coming back wasn't the physical aspect it was the 10 minutes of meditation at the end. For those 10 minutes, my racing thoughts would quiet just enough that I could breathe again.

I started going twice a week, then three times. I bought a cheap mat and started practicing simple poses at home between dropping the kids at school and work.

Six months later, I can now flow through a full vinyasa class. I've discovered muscles I never knew I had. But more importantly, my mind has transformed. The breathing techniques have helped me manage anxiety attacks. The meditation practice has helped me sit with difficult emotions instead of running from them.

I've made friends at the studio something I never expected. We get coffee after Saturday morning classes sometimes. It's the first social circle I've had that's completely my own, not connected to my ex.

Yoga didn't fix everything I still have hard days, I'm still rebuilding my life. But it gave me tools to weather the storm and a community that holds space for me exactly as I am.

For anyone going through a major life transition who's on the fence about trying yoga please give it a chance. You don't need to be flexible or strong or peaceful. You just need to show up and breathe.",208,1743895890.0,yoga,20,1.0,False

Been dating since October 2024.
I have been paying for every date since now, April 2025.

She stays at my place rent free/utilities free everything paid for having moved from living with her mother and sister. 

I recently just booked a trip to Portugal for both of us paying for flights and accommodation, a trip to Germany and a concert, both paid by me, some weekends to mountains by car all paid by me and while on the phone talking about the the price for flights to Paris I said jokingly ‚Äúok we go by car‚Äù to which she replied ‚Äúyou go alone‚Äù.

Also in the first months of the relationship she said something like ‚ÄúI wouldn t look at someone working as a cashier‚Äù answering my question ‚Äúwould you be with me if I didn t have money?‚Äù It seemd logical at that point considering her age and us talking about children sometimes.

Also ‚ÄúI only asked to pay at the first date to see if you let me‚Äù. 

Also asking me like 3 times in the first month ‚ÄúAre you stingy/cheap?‚Äù Which I later took as ‚Äú are you willing to support me financially‚Äù?

I earn twice the amount she makes and I have recived gifts of total of about 100-150‚Ç¨ in this period. She paid for coffee like 3 times.

Anyways, I find it strange that she claims to be independent given the fact that her car is bought with borrowed money from a relative and she still hasn t paid back but made plans to go to Canada with her sister and friend before we met. Trip that would cover her debt to the relative which she says she feels bad for not paying it.


Anyways, how do I find out if she is with me only for money?

1jsgjyb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jsgjyb,Ikape blind shaker review,"I received this a few days ago. I was using a tooth-pick as my distribution tool and was wanting an upgrade. I got this Ikape shaker off AliExpress. Cost me 28$ CAD  
First off its really nice to have a proper distribution tool. My shots showed marked improvement immediately.   
However this shaker is not perfect. 

1. The main issue with it is that the central post is too short and does not seat against the lid which allows it to rattle when shaking. I noticed this before putting coffee in it for the first time and fixed it. The post is threaded to the flared base so I was able to add a shim I made with what I had on hand which ended up being a slice of a synthetic wine bottle stopper. I don't know if coffee would come out without this fix.
2. The lid and the main body of the shaker have recessed grooves that were milles away that allow grounds to get stuck in. The groove on the lid is pretty big and tapping the shaker after shaking allows most of them to fall back down. The groove on the main body however is rather small so grounds get stuck there. You can see a groove on the outside of the shaker just above the logo. At first I thought the body was made in two parts and that these were screwed together. That would have possibly explained the post being too short and the weid gap inside but I haven't been ble to screw/unscrew the body.
3. The shaker is advertised as 51mm ans it fits great on my basket. However the way the IMS basket is shaped it sits too flat to my portafilter and doesn't allow the magnets to catch while the basket is seated in the portafilter. My dosing funnel from an other brand also now suffers from this issue since I have upgraded my basket. 
4. In the pictures you can see what the retention looks like. In this particular case it's the retention of fines from this morning's V60 coming out of the Q2. The lid is clean as it has been brushed off. Take not that the groove in the body I have decided to let the coffee sit in there and the coffee you see is from espresso grounds from last night.",0,1743895353.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

1jsghxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jsghxo/stimulant_effect_question/,Stimulant Effect Question,"Hi everyone, newbie to all of this. Sorry admins if I'm doing this wrong.

Mid 40's Female. Feral housewife and mom. Lost. 
 
Supposidly have a diagnosis - adhd inattentive, came at it after years of anxiety and depression meds not doing anything (sometimes making it horribly worse).  C-PTSD, hair trigger trauma response, hypevigilance expert. 

Was tr√≠aled on Intuniv and told psyc it made things better almost straight away (which didn't seem right, but I did notice a difference). She handed me the DIVA 2.0 & a stack of scripts for stimulants. Didn't try them at first. When I did try low dose of Ritalin, my anxiety worse but also noticed a ...space, between a thought and action. Also was able to not be overwhelmed by the 20 page form and slowly got it finished.  Once I actually started it it wasn't so bad. Did notice a difference in my handwriting between what I did with and without stimulants. 

Later asked her if I could try dex instead due to the anxiety. She texted a script back.  Didn't have a diagnosis yet so the long acting ones were  too expensive Dex didn't aggravate my anxiety quite as much, but it would sometimes work, and sometimes 15 minutes after taking it I'd be barely able to stay awake. Like in early pregnancy where you just have to go for a napzzzzzz.

Tried concerta and Vyvanse. Both the lower dose. They put me to sleep about four hours after taking them, and I'd just ...crash? Even if I'd eaten. It felt like an implosion. Like everything on the outside was too much and I was collapsing under the strain. 

 If anyone has ever used an old manual focus camera that has that circle in the middle where it goes from blurry and out of focus to super sharp focus, that's what my brain felt like after an hour. 

Like in Westworld where the robots get brought back online. 

As if someone had taken a video of cream being poured into coffee and stirred and then played it backwards.

Sometimes I notice that things that were too ""complicated"" (like calling a specialists office or scheduling a mammogram) before seem possible and I can see options for solving problems. Whereas before it was like everything is too hard and I can't figure anything out. 

When I emailed my psyc that I was falling asleep her answer was scripts for 30's and 40's. Not falling asleep on the 30's at least. But I also don't feel that moment of clarity. Like my body has gotten used to the medication after a month. 


I didn't get a certificate, and I feel like I've talked myself into this diagnosis since having it means the meds are cheaper and the Intuniv actually seemed to help. I feel like my brain is working like it used to before it was overwhelmed with everything that life has become and a complex child (we take the same exact meds but they also have an ASD diagnosis).

But then I read on another thread? Subreddit? That neurotypicals also feel effects from stimulants and I'm suddenly lost and confused and worried. I thought that the old school way of testing for adhd was to throw meds at people and see if they stick (honestly what it's like with anxiety and depression, lost track of all the meds they tried me on)

Oh, one other thing. Sometimes in the evening when the vyvanse has worn off I want to die. It's the same feeling I've had for years, but now I remember in the mornings what it's like to feel like I can get something done, but in the evening I realize it's all pointless and I'm not going to accomplish the goals I'm working towards and will never get a job and I'm just a waste. (Mods I hope I've worded this ok, I've seen the rule, yes I'll be mentioning it to my dr).

My question (I guess, after all of that, I really did try and keep it short).  Does any of this sound right? Normal? Am I in the wrong place? Help?

When I rule the world all the money given to sports will go for medical research so we can have a test that tells us 100% what is going on with us and how to manage all of life with it. 

Also there will be only ONE referencing style for research papers and it'll be easy to understand. 

And I'll outlaw gravity so I don't break things all the time, plus astronauts look like they have so much fun. 

Sorry again it's so long :(

I have been dealing with a rare gyno issue and she has been otherwise incredibly helpful. As some can tell from my post history, I have run into a lot of minor issues with my therapist, but I‚Äôve been able to get past them. This is my first experience in therapy so the internet is my source for finding out what is and isn‚Äôt normal. 

In my most recent session T and I were talking about how many doctors can be dismissive of the psych effects of surgeries. She talked about how she had a client who was distressed that had surgery for vulvar cancer who worries she looks like Frankenstein down there, and how the clients surgeon said that she should just be grateful she‚Äôs alive and that when the client recounted that story in therapy T said ‚ÄúI was like oh my god becky‚Äù.

It was quiet, and she clearly talking to herself so i didn‚Äôt mention it as it was unintentional. 

I am a little worried because I have an uncommon ethnic first name, so it would make me a little concerned if ‚Äúbecky‚Äù was indeed a real name, since if she did the equivalent of that with talking about me with another client, that becomes more identifiable, and alongside sensitive medical info.

My T has a home office. The office is separated from the main living room by french doors. She does have adult daughters in their early 20s but if they are home they know to stay in their rooms when clients are around (its a one story house, they would have to in order to avoid bumping into clients). As is usual, when our session ended, my T opened the doors and walked into the living room to lead me out. At the same time I heard one of her daughter‚Äôs voice in the living room, and I stepped back far away from the door back into the office. To her credit, my T immediately held up her hand to signal to me to stay there. The daughter said something about that she was just petting the dog. My T, who was clearly annoyed, mentioned confidentiality and told her daughter to go to her room so that I could leave. The daughter definitely knew their was a therapy session going on because she remarked she was blocked in the driveway. My T has clients park in the driveway, I said to my T i can park on the street next time and she said not to worry that it wasn‚Äôt urgent that her daughter just wanted to get coffee. 

I don‚Äôt know how long the daughter was sitting there, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder how much she heard, how thin the walls are, because it was the adjacent room. Am i being paranoid here? Am I just piling on my therapist here? It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt trust her, it just this seems a little careless. I do give her a ton of credit for being quick to react to noticing her daughter on the sofa. My next session won‚Äôt be for another month but I plan on bringing my concerns up there. How do I do that in a way that doesn‚Äôt make me sound paranoid/accusatory? Do I sound like that now in my post? I‚Äôm sort of at a loss here. 

Also, for the therapists out there who share non identifiable client info when it‚Äôs irrelevant, do you ever use fake first names or is that not a thing and I‚Äôm being too generous.

Edit: based on the context, I‚Äôm pretty sure Becky is not her real name. She was likely quoting a song. So my only concern is the situation with her daughter. ",5,1743895065.0,TalkTherapy,12,0.78,False

This conundrum is also heavily focused on POC, but if I posted here is because we love watching your show and being ‚Äúpart of this family‚Äù.
I, female, 38 am half Angolan and half indigenous (Amazonian Guarani). My partner, male, 32 is of Jamaican descent. We both live in North America. 
We both grew up in predominantly white communities and were often the ‚Äúoutcast‚Äù in most our social groups, including private school, sports teams, universities etc. I was born in the Amazon and adopted by a white family. We both experienced racism and prejudice starting at a very early age and both carry our respective wounds due to it. 
However, we experienced opposite paths growing into adulthood:
In highschool, I focused on learning about my heritage, engaged in civil rights and social movements, learned to love myself and face my own internalized racism and self hatred despite the constant ‚Äúbeatings‚Äù of living in a racist society. 
I moved on to study political science, teach racial relations and empowerment of WOC and POC In general. 
My partner on the other hand - and I don‚Äôt blame him for it - chose to ‚Äúlighten up‚Äù his blackness. Refrained from speaking AAVE, and surrounded himself mostly by melanin deficient people at melanin deficient places if you know what I mean. While I fully embraced my origin and heritage unapologetically, He basically white washed himself in the hopes of not having to face the daily battles and open wounds. Keep himself away from the radars if you will. 
I totally understand him and try not to be judgmental of his choices as an (incredibly beautiful btw) BIG BLACK MAN of the 90% chocolate kind lol. 
I am a skinny tiny woman of caramel skin and Amazonian hair and I totally understands the nuances of collorism  and my ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù within our communities. 
HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEM BEGINS!!!:
I am the FIRST black woman he has ever dated. He has always dated white (very white) women or the occasional asian. And he has a history of setting absolutely NO boundaries with every white person in his life, be it girlfriends or just friends or colleagues. He has never called out any of his friends for making a racist joke. He would always just brush it off with the excuse that ‚ÄúThats not their real sentiment, they‚Äôre just goofing around, they are very good friends to me‚Ä¶‚Äù. Because he just wants to keep the peace and comfort. 
I told him that is his problem and choice if he wants to be THAT man, but I don‚Äôt allow this type of behaviour around me and I am not here to keep anybody comfortable. 
He also has no boundaries and will let any white woman tell control him. Some examples:
- My former roommate, Jessie would order him around the house for hours doing gardening, setting up furniture, cleaning etc until I had to tell her ‚ÄúJessie, this is not your cotton farm, give the man a break and let us spend some time alone, he doesn‚Äôt even live here. If you want something done for you you come to ME first‚Äù
- one of his close friends would call him late at night and once asked him to go over and SPEND THE NIGHT AT HER PLACE, babysit her daughter and have Easter Lunch with them the next day
(Ps, he DIDNT)
- Another close (white woman) friend keeps requesting to get coffee (without me) and cry about her infertility problems for hours to the point of even asking him for his ‚ÄúMAN SEED‚Äù!!(he didn‚Äôt)
None of them ask about his life, none of them seem to care about him. The friendships are blatantly one-sided and he just lets them use him: a ride to do groceries, money for the laundromat, home improvements etc and EVEN HIS MAN SEED!
I pointed out how he was being used and how in every one of these situations he had no concept of setting boundaries until I taught him. 
He always apologized, respected MY boundaries and little by little is learning to set boundaries with his friends. But always relying on me to point them out and basically bottle feed him the steps through it. 
Now, mind you, HE NEVER CHEATED on me. And never had any romantic or spicy relationship with any of these women. I trust him and I KNOW he loves me. 
We live together, work from home and are together 90% of the time. We have full access to each other‚Äôs phones, emails, socials, banking, everything‚Ä¶
We both come from abusive relationships and this is both our first HEALTHY, long term relationship. 
We choose kindness, communication, commitment, healthy boundaries and 100% transparency. We are in love, we are best friends, we are each other‚Äôs home. 
Now here is the catalyst event that triggered my original question:

He keeps forgetting to put his phone on silent as he is a heavy sleeper and early bird. But I am a night owl and light sleeper. I often have to reach to his phone to turn off the volume around 1-2am when im about to fall asleep and his notifications keep beeping. Theyre usually general spam mail, banking updates and such‚Ä¶ 
But this time‚Ä¶ This time it was SEED NEEDING LADY. Since she‚Äôs been abroad for the past year and has some health issues I opened up her message to make sure it wasn‚Äôt an emergency. 
But what I saw completely DEVASTATED ME. 
She had just sent him a picture wearing a bikini bottom and a crop top with a funny phrase of a bit they share as an inside joke. 
Further up a couples days behind in the conversation she had shared a meme degrading the appearance of a black woman. FURTHER UP back in the conversation she had shared a TRANSPHOBIC meme making fun of Philipino women! My boyfriend LAUGH REACTED TO THESE MEMES! 

I WAS HEARTBROKEN AND HUMILIATED AND FEELING BETRAYED! 

I Imediately woke him up and asked:
‚Äú-What the F is this???? 
How DARE this Ugly A$$ beesh feel entitled to degrade any other woman?? How dare she put down women of collour in front of a black man. Knowing he dates a black woman. 
Why does she have to be half naked in the picture? And most importantly, WHY IS SHE COMFORTABLE DOING IT WITH YOU? WHY DO YOU LET HER DO IT?‚Äù 

I gave him the phone and told him ‚ÄúDEAL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW!‚Äù And went outside to calm myself down. 

He immediately texted her back saying he would not tolerate racist memes anymore and he is not comfortable with her sending him pictures in a bikini. 

He then apologized to me and confessed that he still feels uncomfortable and scared of confronting his friends and setting boundaries. 

I told him that I am tired of watching him being used and abused by his friends. I am tired of watching him being disrespected and I am tired of being disrespected myself.  I told him that we talked about this several times and although he made progress I CANNOT STAND IT ANYMORE. I will no longer hold his hand and show him how to set boundaries. 
He chooses the comfort of other people over MY DIGNITY AND MY COMFORT. I told him that he MUST show all his interactions to his mother and sisters and ask THEM for their guidance. 

AM I OVER REACTING OVER HIS SLOW LEARNING CURVE AND FEAR OF CONFRONTATION/BOUNDARIES??

Now for Seed Needing Lady, SHE SCARES ME: SHE IS A NURSE!! 
We all know how biased and DANGEROUS the health system can be for women of colour. This woman is the type of nurse that puts us in danger. 

WOULD IT BE PETTY REVENGE TO REPORT HER TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH/HIS EMPLOYERS?? 

Ps.: I do not condone demeaning people for their appearance and of course I am jealous of him. But she really is objectively unpleasant to the eyes, which makes her AUDACITY even more shocking. And I have no respect for women who put down other women. But I have no problem being an equal opportunity offender. 

Ps2.: HE GAVE ME PERMISSION TO SEND MYSELF SCREENSHOTS, WRITE THE POST AND PUT THEM BOTH ON BLAST HOWEVER I WANT.  As he wants to learn better and read people‚Äôs opinions too.

Dear Starbucks, 

I'd like to make you aware that your new travel mugs (Discovery Series) are simply horrible. I was collecting the ""Been There"" mugs right before you changed them out for those awful things. The ""Been There"" mugs have a style and charm that the ""Discovery"" mugs simply lack. When I reach for a mug from my collection, I always grab one from the ""Been There"" series. The designs on the ""Discovery"" mugs are boring, and none of them stand out from each other. To top it off, the ""Discovery"" mugs are cheaper and actually stain from coffee and tea (what a disaster). I have no reason to pop into a Starbucks anymore, and honestly I'm so devastated by this change that I can't be bothered.

1jsg94d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1jsg94d/family_is_ignoring_me/,Family is ignoring me,"Hello
I‚Äôm an Aupair in New Jersey, i worked for a family for 6 months and now came to a different family three weeks ago. At first everything seemed fine, not perfect but also not too bad. 
However, i soon realized that the parents are REALLY busy. They work all day and spend their day in the office or at work. There are days where i only see them once when they come into the kitchen to grab a coffee and they will say good morning but nothing else. This has made it really hard for me since i don‚Äôt only want to bond with the kids, i also want to be close to my host parents. It‚Äôs also difficult because i can‚Äôt see how they parent their children (I work in the morning until the kids go to school and then after they come back until they go to sleep, so the parents are barely involved). 
I tried to engage conversation, like once i asked if we could have a ‚Äúfeedback conversation‚Äù where i wanted to sit down and have a nice talk about how it‚Äôs been going, but instead my host mum CALLED me and had a 5 minute conversation with me before she said she has to go back to work. Now, i told them that while i will finish my aupair year with them, i don‚Äôt want to extend with them (they asked me at the beginning if i could extend and i said maybe) they seem upset because i am looking for a different family to extend with. Also, when i had that conversation with my host mum she again only took two minutes out of her day to listen to me before she left me alone in the kitchen with the kids that heard that i will leave after my term has ended. The kids were disappointed and i had to deal with that. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good parenting how the mum just left the kids with me after they heard such unexpected news. 
Now it seems like they are treating me even worse because i told them i don‚Äôt want to extend with them. They talk even less to me and only give me a ‚Äúpolite‚Äù smile when we‚Äôre in the same room. Today the worst thing happened. I was in the kitchen eating a bagel when the host dad called everyone into the kitchen to write down what they want from the restaurant where he was ordering food. All the kids circled their stuff on the menu, but my host dad didn‚Äôt even ask me if i want anything. When my hostmum came into the kitchen she didn‚Äôt even look at me. Now i hear them eating upstairs and they didn‚Äôt ask me to join. I get that they probably saw that i was already eating a bagel, but i still think they should‚Äôve asked me, right? i would have liked to order something i could eat for lunch tomorrow. 

I‚Äôm just posting this to get some opinions, am i overreacting or is this normal? I don‚Äôt want to go into a rematch since my first family (the one i stayed with for six months) initiated a rematch and i don‚Äôt want that again. I think i should have a conversation with them but as i said, the two times that i wanted a conversation i got less than ten minutes of my host mums time. 
My term is ending in August and i‚Äôm hoping to go to a different family then, should i just push through until this term ends?

Thanks everyone!!!",11,1743894470.0,Aupairs,5,0.92,False

My wife (31F) and I (32M) are traveling from Canada to Italy for 4 weeks in May/June with our baby (will be 7 months old when we start the trip. He's been on one trip to Mexico before and it went very well).

Our goal is to take things slow keep things relatively simple due to the baby, meaning logistics.
We want to visit historical and cultural landmarks, take in beautiful landscapes, drink lots of great coffee and people watch during our many rest breaks and eat lots of gelato.

We're bringing a very convenient/easy-to-fold-and-navigate travel stroller and two separate baby carriers. We plan on traveling light and using whatever tool is more convenient for the day's and each respective city's activities. Some locations will include longer day trips with the baby, spread across with rest days.

I'd preferably like to keep the busy tourist stuff to the early mornings and chill the rest of the day with no pressure. I'd also prefer to keep travel simple logistically and spread out.

We're staying at a mix of hotels and airbnbs. Everything is refundable and I'm very open to suggestions, feedback and any recommendations for traveling this long with baby this age.


May 23: Rome (6 nights in Trastevere, 5 nights near Termini station). Planning on the classics but it may be a long time in Rome.

June 3: Train to Venice

June 6: Train to Florence - Pisa - La Spezia for a few days in Cinque Terre

June 10: Train back to Florence, staying in Historical Center

June 14 Train to Naples for a few nights, then to Campa for Amalfi Coast. Plan to do day trips to Sorrento, Capri and Pompeii/Herculaem

June 20: Train back to Florence until 25

***I Am Root (Beer)***: As close to a Marvel-licensed root beer that we‚Äôll see, this one from MI‚Äôs Schmohz Brewery is firmly in the vanilla camp.  It does everything right between balanced fizz and a nice sweet/bitter ratio.  It‚Äôll disappear on you because it‚Äôs such a pleasing sip.  Solid! Found at Soda Pop Bros.

***Iron Heart***: Produced by Iron Heart Coffee Company, this can is a meal!  The opening whiff is absolutely licorice.  You immediately get heavy CO2 with generous helpings of wintergreen/anise.  The sweetness is held in check for sure.  I appreciate the unique richness, and it pairs well with pizza, but it‚Äôs not an easy drinker.  The aftertaste is off-putting, and I‚Äôd call it licorice motor oil!

***Iron Horse***: Take what I just said about Iron Heart, but have none of the flavors come forward.  This horse is muted on taste, and all you really get is a low-grade mix that almost tastes like cinnamon.  The fizz is fine, but it never settles into any semblance of a root beer taste.  It‚Äôs serviceable with pizza, but it may work better in a float.

***Ithaca***: Closing out with a big winner, Ithaca is delicious.  I‚Äôd venture to say it‚Äôs a birch with bite.  Wintergreen forward and without a noticeable bitter bottom, there‚Äôs nothing to complain about here.  It belongs in rotation with the best of them.  The ingredients are also on point.  Found at North Market Pop Shop!

I think she was around 25 when she got her first job at the coffee house. And so was I. It‚Äôs something I felt ashamed for at the time but once I got my foot in the door, I gained confidence and like Rachel I started thinking about how I want to build my career.

So I was wondering, what do you think makes Rachel successful in her career ? To go from serving coffee to a high grade fashion executive is pretty impressive! How did she do it? The show is a bit inconsistent around whether or not Rach is a hard worker. At the beginning of her career she very famously was working long hours and was extremely enthusiastic about learning how to do a good job. Which became relationship ending with Ross. But in later seasons she jokes about not working and playing computer games at work.

What can we learn and apply in real life? Granted the job market is VERY different in 2025 but maybe there‚Äôs some good pages we can take out of her book even 20 years later.",3,1743894255.0,howyoudoin,4,1.0,False

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!
