True Heiress Returns to Her ""Unemployed"" Rich Family


Chapter 1 Kicked Out


On the day Arabella Macdonald left, she thought she could slip away from the Macdonald Villa quietly.

But her adoptive mother, Freya Macdonald, called her in right before her departure.

Seeing the Macdonald family's true daughter, Harper Macdonald, curled up on the sofa with Dylan Johnston, the playboy heir of the Johnston family, Arabella understood everything instantly.

The Macdonald family and the Johnston family had an existing engagement.

Dylan had always claimed to be her fiancé, showering her with attention since high school.

He pulled out all the stops to win her over.

And yet, Harper had been back for less than a week, and he was already wrapped around her finger.

He never liked me. He just liked the title 'the Macdonald family's daughter'.

Seeing Arabella had noticed, Freya didn't bother hiding anything.

""Arabella, you can see for yourself,"" Freya said. ""Harper and Dylan are simply a better match.

""The engagement with the Johnston family was originally for you. But you and Dylan never had any spark. Harper and he connected almost immediately.

""You can't force it. Fate decides who belongs with whom.

""I expect you won't cause any trouble for Dylan going forward. The two of them will be announcing their engagement soon.""

Arabella had thought they had something important to say. She raised a mocking eyebrow. ""You should be saying this to Dylan. He's the one who's been clinging to me for years. I have zero interest in him.""

A snake like him? I've seen through him long ago.

Trash like that, anyone can have him.

Being looked down on by Arabella for years had filled Dylan with resentment.

Now that she was exposed as a fake, her haughty attitude infuriated him.

He sneered, ""Listen to the impostor, talking big!

""No wonder I never felt a spark all these years. You are a fraud!

""Thank God we never finalized the wedding plans. Imagine if I'd ended up married to a counterfeit!""

He ridiculed her status with disgust, though inwardly he felt a pang of regret.

Arabella's looks and figure are miles above Harper's.

What a waste that she isn't the real daughter of the Macdonald family.

Hearing his shameless words, Arabella couldn't help but laugh coldly. ""I should be the one saying that. Thank goodness someone stepped in to take out the trash—saved me from having to look at that pizza face of yours any longer.""

""You!"" Dylan's pockmarked face twisted with rage.

Seeing her boyfriend being mocked, Harper felt spiteful but put on a show of sympathy. ""Dylan, don't be so harsh. You'll hurt Arabella's feelings.

""If I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have 'taken' you from her, or her place as the Macdonald daughter.""

""Anything she says now comes from a place of pain. Just let it go."" Harper played the understanding one perfectly.

Arabella looked at her and cut her performance short. ""My feelings aren't hurt. That garbage chased me for seven or eight years, and I never gave him a second glance. But you? You latched onto him in a week. Trash meets scheming bitch. A perfect match.""

This directly provoked Freya. ""You ungrateful wretch! Such a vicious tongue!

""No wonder I could never warm up to you. You're ill-mannered at your core!

""You took Harper's place and lived in luxury for eighteen years. She suffered in a sanitation worker's home. And you dare speak to her like that?

""Outrageous!""

Being scolded, Arabella's gaze only grew colder and more indifferent.

The ""luxury"" she enjoyed in the Macdonald family was entirely self-made.

Her adoptive father, Carter Macdonald, was a terrible businessman. He was hardworking in his youth and saved up to open a factory, but he had no real business sense.

If not for her secret assistance, that factory would have gone under at least eight times over.

The Macdonald family would never have moved to Doranor City, let alone become one of the three biggest merchants in the Meridian District.

But Arabella had never told Carter and Freya any of this. They had no idea the factory's biggest investor was her.

Carter hadn't wanted to get involved, but the arguing downstairs forced him to make an appearance.

He came down, deliberately frowning at Freya to look like the good guy. ""Enough. Is that any way to talk to her?

""Arabella is going back to her birth family today. She'll have enough hardships. We're the ones who made the mistake all those years ago. It's not her fault. Don't send her off with such coldness.""

Though his kindness was an act, Carter was at least being fair.

Still, looking at Arabella, his feelings were complicated. I have always been fond of her. She has been a lovely child.

But if she hadn't been here, we wouldn't have gone eighteen years without looking for our real daughter. Harper wouldn't have suffered so much then.

He sighed, ""Arabella, you may not be my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. In my heart, you're still a daughter to me.

""I've made some inquiries. Your birth parents seem to be unemployed. If you ever need help in the future, don't hesitate to come to me."" It was a hollow offer, pure hypocrisy.

Freya immediately elbowed him, standing up. ""Why are you being so charitable? They'll latch onto you like leeches!""

Parents with no proper jobs? What kind of family is that?

Arabella looked at the hypocritical Macdonald family and Dylan, her expression detached. ""That won't be necessary, Mr. Macdonald. If anything, you should be more careful managing the factory and the company from now on. Especially... watch the people closest to you.""

Her eyes flickered toward Freya, her meaning clear.

There was a real snake in the company.

Freya and her older brother had been embezzling for years. If Arabella hadn't been secretly keeping watch on them, they would have drained half the company's funds by now.

If her birth family were truly poor, she wouldn't have the time to watch over the Macdonald family's interests anymore.

Hearing this, Freya exploded. ""You just can't stand to see us do well, can you? Cursing the company on your way out? Talking as if you ever managed your dad's factory? Who do you think you are?""

Arabella knew arguing with Freya was pointless. She just snorted, ""You'll find out exactly who I am soon enough.""

Let's see how tough you are then.

Tired of the talk, Arabella stood up and slung her only backpack over her shoulder.

It held just her documents and the laptop she bought herself. She was taking nothing else.

Dylan, however, couldn't resist a final jab. ""Mr. Macdonald, Mrs. Macdonald, she's not taking any luggage. That bag might be stuffed with valuables. You should probably check it.""

Let's see how high and mighty she is after a search.

Freya seized on the idea. ""Dylan's right! Open it up. Let's see what's inside.""    


Chapter 2 Fawning Over That Impostor


Harper quickly put on an act. ""Mom, isn't that a bit much? Arabella's family is so poor. Even if she took a few things, it would just help her get by. Let it go.""

Freya sneered, ""Everything in her room was bought by your father and me. What right does she have to use our things to 'get by'? Her parents are unemployed. A few trinkets won't fix that.""

With that, Freya moved to check Arabella's backpack.

But Arabella, as if expecting this pettiness, simply opened the bag herself. ""There's nothing from the Macdonald family in here. My ID is mine. This laptop, and the clothes I'm wearing, were bought with my scholarship money.""

If she hadn't been the one supporting the entire household all these years—and didn't want to leave them a cent—she would have thrown money in their faces.

But they weren't worth it.

Seeing Arabella truly had taken nothing, Harper and Dylan looked disappointed.

She actually has some pride.

With the Macdonald family speechless, Arabella shouldered her backpack to leave.

But then a weak voice called from the stairs. ""Arabella... Wait...""

The family turned, stunned.

It was Edward Macdonald, who had just had major surgery, hurrying downstairs.

Seeing her precious son, Freya rushed to support him. ""Edward! It's nothing important. You should be resting. Why did you come down?""

Edward had severe aplastic anemia. He'd recently had a bone marrow transplant performed by a reclusive specialist. The surgery was successful, but he was in recovery—a time when stress and exertion were dangerous. They'd deliberately kept him from seeing Arabella off.

Yet here he was.

Seeing her frail older brother, who had always protected her, a ripple of emotion stirred in Arabella's cold heart. She paused.

Edward shot Freya an annoyed look. ""If you hadn't had Albie babysit me, I wouldn't have had to rush.""

The butler, Albie Allan, had refused to let him come down. He'd only managed by sending Albie away.

He was just glad Arabella was still there.

Without ceremony, Edward pulled out a bank card and pressed it into Arabella's hand.

He said, ""Arabella, Dad told me. Your birth parents don't work. Your brothers... don't seem to have proper jobs either. Some are still in school. I'm worried you'd have no money over there. This is my savings. Take it, for emergencies.""

Holding the card, Arabella felt a genuine warmth.

So, in this whole family, only Edward truly cares about me.

It made all her efforts to research his illness and ensure his surgery was successful worth it. Leaving him was her only real regret.

Seeing Edward give money away, Freya panicked. ""You foolish boy! What are you doing? That's your only card! There's at least a hundred thousand dollars in there. Why give it to her? She's not your real sister!""

Hearing this, Harper grew anxious but played the victim. ""Edward is so kind... so generous to Arabella. He's barely spoken to me since I came home.""

Seeing her upset, Dylan jumped in. ""Edward, you're way too biased. You're cold to your own sister but fawning over that impostor?""

""You!"" Edward, insulted, was immediately furious.

Seeing Edward's anger, Arabella's eyes darkened. She picked up a glass of water and threw it in Dylan's face.

Dylan, the Johnston family heir, had never been treated like this. He roared in outrage, ""Arabella! How dare you!""

But Arabella's gaze was icy and terrifying. ""Dylan, this is the Macdonald Villa. Who do you think you are, yelling at the master of the house? Edward just had major surgery. He can't get agitated. Watch your mouth!""

Dylan, relying on the two families' long friendship, had always overstayed his welcome at the villa. First, it was to pester her. Now, with Harper by his side, he'd become even more brazen. But daring to speak to Edward like that? He was overstepping.

Knowing he'd offended Edward, and seeing the dark looks on Carter and Freya's faces, Dylan backed down.

Harper seized the chance to stir the pot. ""Mom, Dad, even if she was defending Edward, Arabella went too far. Throwing water? So rude.""

Harper really knows how to twist the knife.

Arabella had had enough. She pressed the card back into Edward's hand. ""Edward, you need to focus on recovery. Buy yourself some proper supplements. Keep the money for yourself.""

""Arabella..."" Edward tried to protest, but Arabella firmly gripped his hand.

For a girl, her grip was surprisingly strong. He couldn't pull free.

Arabella gave him a sincere smile, saying, ""I appreciate the thought. But Edward, don't worry. I'm not short on money. Take good care of yourself after I'm gone.""

With that, she released his hand.

Edward, flustered, tried to give her the card again.

But Arabella was already walking away, her departure as cool and decisive as her demeanor.

Dylan muttered bitterly, ""'Not short on money'? Still playing the big shot even now? Arabella, you're such a phony!""

The words had festered for seven or eight years. Finally saying them didn't make him feel better, though.

That wretched woman, splashing me even on her way out. Damn it!

Seeing his embarrassed state, Harper quickly fetched a handkerchief to dab his face.

Freya, seeing Edward had the card back, snatched it. ""Thank goodness she has some shame. Could you imagine the loss?""

Outside, seeing no driver of the Macdonald family was going to offer her a ride, Arabella pulled out her phone to call a car.

But just then, a sleek, black, unmarked sports car pulled up.

She couldn't identify the make, but the engine's purr told her it was no ordinary vehicle.

In the sunlight, the black paint had a deep, luminous sheen.

The color and finish whispered of hidden luxury.

The tires and rims were high-end, too.

This was clearly a custom, modified car for the ultra-wealthy, easily worth as much as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.

Did some big shot just arrive?

To Arabella's surprise, the man who got out looked anything but a big shot. He was dressed shabbily, with dark circles under his eyes.

He wasn't much older than her, maybe four or five years, but he was unshaven and seemed generally worn out. Despite his disheveled appearance, his eyes were sharp and alert.

They landed on Arabella, and a flicker of surprise passed through them. ""You must be Arabella, right?"" he asked.  


Chapter 3 Dislocating the Scumbag's Arm


He continued, ""You and Mom... You really look like twins.""

His family said they'd send someone to pick up Arabella today. He'd just finished a case and was on leave, so he offered to swing by and get her. That way, the family could just wait and welcome them both home.

He thought he might need an introduction at the Macdonald Villa. But one look at Arabella, and he knew.

Seeing the man's face, which bore a clear resemblance to her own, Arabella raised an eyebrow. ""You're... my brother?""

Alfred Hamilton quickly introduced himself, ""Yes. I'm Alfred Hamilton, your third brother.""

Only then did Alfred notice Arabella's odd look. He glanced down and remembered.

Right. I've been on a stakeout for that drug lord for days. Barely slept, and haven't changed clothes. I just came straight here. Too tired on the drive to even think about buying a new suit.

""Sorry, I came in a rush. Forgot to change..."" Alfred was cold and indifferent in his unit, an unyielding leader. But here, in front of his little sister, he felt uncharacteristically embarrassed.

Arabella was about to say it was fine when Harper's voice piped up from behind them. ""Where did this beggar come from? Security! How did you just let someone wander in?""

The villa's security guard hurried over. ""Ms. Macdonald, he said he was here to pick up Arabella. So I let him through.""

Hearing this, Harper turned to Arabella with feigned surprise. ""Oh... Arabella, I'm so sorry. I didn't know this was your family. Please don't mind what I just said.""

Arabella looked at her coldly. ""If you're sorry, then shut up. No one wants to hear you talk.""

With that, she walked past Harper, opened the passenger door of Alfred's car, and tossed her backpack inside.

Dylan had followed them out, eager to get back at her for the water incident.

Seeing Alfred's car with no visible brand logo, he sneered, ""Well, well. I've never seen a car without a badge. Did your family assemble this themselves in the backyard?""

Alfred, still leaning tiredly against the car, replied calmly, ""Actually, yes. We did.""

They were special forces. Every vehicle was heavily modified. His, in particular, had been designed by their fifth brother, Daniel Hamilton.

Daniel was still a PhD student but was already a weaponry design expert earmarked by the Defense Department. The weapons and vehicles he designed, once modified, were exceptionally powerful and had unmatched performance—they could even save your life in a crisis. So this car's value far exceeded any luxury vehicle on the market, and its modification cost alone rivaled a supercar's.

Dylan, of course, missed the meaning entirely. He kept mocking Arabella. ""I'm shocked your family even has a car. But with no logo... maybe it's stolen?""

Harper played along, pretending to be concerned. ""Arabella, you should be careful. What if you accidentally become an accessory? You could get in serious legal trouble.""

Arabella was rolling her eyes.

Their nonsense inside was bad enough. Now they're outside, taunting my family?

She'd had enough.

But before she could speak, Alfred's expression darkened. He walked straight toward them.

Alfred was over six feet tall. Standing in front of Dylan, he seemed like a giant. He clapped a heavy hand on Dylan's shoulder and said, ""Kid, you can eat whatever you want, but you can't say whatever you want. Did no one ever teach you that?""

Years of running devil training for his team and interrogating prisoners had earned Alfred a nickname—Ruthless Death. The look on his face now made Dylan feel like he might wet himself.

He'd never seen anyone with such a terrifying presence.

""I... I was just... speculating..."" he said.

Alfred snorted, ""Speculating? This country may have free speech, but you're legally responsible for every word you say. If your parents didn't teach you, I can.""

As he spoke, the hand on Dylan's shoulder tightened slightly.

There was a sickening crack. Dylan's shoulder was dislocated in an instant.

Dylan felt like his arm had vanished. Excruciating pain made him shriek. ""Ah! Okay! I won't! Let me go!""

Only then did Alfred, his face still cold, sharply pull the arm back into place.

Dylan was now pale and speechless with fear. But Harper still hadn't understood what was going on.

Alfred glanced sideways at Harper. She shuddered violently.

His eyes are terrifying.

""Little girl,"" Alfred said, his voice low. ""I don't hit women. I'll let you off today. Next time I see you, keep your mouth clean. I don't like anyone cursing my family.""

Talking about my sister getting in serious legal trouble?

You're asking for it.

Harper could only nod, thoroughly cowed.

Alfred finally released the coercion. He turned back to Arabella with a warm smile. ""Arabella, let's go.""

Arabella looked at his smiling face. It was hard to believe this was the same intimidating man from moments ago.

Alfred is definitely not ordinary.

But since he has handled Dylan and Harper, I should play the sweet little sister.

""Okay, Alfred."" She climbed into the passenger seat with a smile.

Alfred didn't think much of it. He got in the driver's side, buckled up, and drove away from the Macdonald Villa.

Harper and Dylan were left behind, watching the car disappear, their hearts still pounding.

""What was that guy?"" Dylan muttered, moving his now-functional arm, the fear lingering.

Harper shook her head. ""I don't know. But his license plate... I think it was a Doranor City plate. And... it looked like a government plate.""

That's so strange. He looked so scruffy. How could he be driving a Doranor City government vehicle?

""You must have seen wrong."" Dylan shook his head. He'd been too scared to notice details, but his gut said she was mistaken.

Arabella's birth family is supposedly full of unemployed drifters. How could they afford a Doranor City plate? Only locals can get those.

Getting residency in Doranor City isn't for ordinary people. You are either born into wealth or married into it. The Macdonald family is rich, but even they have out-of-town plates.

Arabella's family has to be dirt poor. There is no way they are Doranor City locals.

So she must have been seeing things.


Chapter 4 Is This for Real?


In the car, Alfred, still feeling a bit awkward, said, ""Sorry about that, Arabella. I came in such a hurry. I forgot to change. I know I'm a mess. Didn't mean to make you the subject of gossip.""

He'd never cared about his appearance before. But he couldn't embarrass Arabella like that again.

Arabella gave an understanding shake of her head. ""It's fine. Clothes should be comfortable, that's all.""

Alfred immediately felt more fond of her.

Noticing she only had the backpack, he asked, ""Arabella, is that all your luggage? Just the one bag?""

Arabella nodded, her tone cool. ""I didn't want a single thing from the Macdonald family.""

Alfred was highly observant. He caught the edge in her voice, and his eyes turned cold.

Did that family make her unhappy?

Then he said gently, ""It's okay. Once we're home, I'll buy you anything you want.""

Arabella offered a warm smile. ""Okay.""

Whatever my family's real situation is, at least Alfred seems genuinely kind.

Arabella noticed the route Alfred was taking. She couldn't help asking, ""Alfred, isn't this the road to Oceanview Peak?""

Oceanview Peak was where Doranor City's wealthiest, most powerful, and most prestigious families lived.

The Peak was enormous, covering almost the entire Sunspire District. Driving up the winding road, they passed massive villa clusters and luxurious estates.

The Macdonald family, new to the city, had made it their mission to learn that Doranor City's ten oldest, most influential families were all clustered here in the Sunspire District.

The problem was that the roads up the mountain had security checkpoints. Unless you were a resident or had an invitation from one, you couldn't enter Oceanview Peak.

Yet their car only paused briefly at a checkpoint. The license plate was scanned, and the gate lifted immediately.

Alfred answered her question casually, ""Yeah. Mom and Dad are waiting for us at home.""

Arabella's eyebrows shot up.

My home is on Oceanview Peak?

I am starting to doubt Carter's investigative skills.

Aren't my parents and brothers supposed to be unemployed drifters?

How could Carter not even know where they live?

Carter was notoriously incompetent. That was why Arabella had had to manage the company from the shadows.

He probably just heard 'unemployed' and made up the rest in his head.

Well, this is good. If my family is well-off, I won't have to worry about supporting them.

They passed several impressive villas. She expected the car to stop, but it didn't.

Then she saw the bigger villas. Okay, so they're a bit wealthier than I thought.

Alfred drove for another ten minutes. They left the villa zone and entered the sprawling estate area. Arabella narrowed her eyes.

Alright. My new family isn't just wealthy. They're seriously wealthy.

Just as that thought settled, the car kept going.

It finally reached the very summit of the peak.

Oceanview Peak got its name because this top road was completely unobstructed, with clear ocean views on both sides.

And at the end of this road stood only one estate.

It was a landmark visible from downtown Doranor City—Cloudrise Manor.

It was iconic because it sat at the city's highest point. From downtown, you could see this castle-like structure against the sky.

It was said to have been personally overseen by Howard Martin, the world's top architect. It was an extremely luxurious, hyper-modern landmark. From this castle, you could see the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most stunning sunset in the evening—hence the name.

The owner was shrouded in mystery. Rumors said even Doranor City's top ten families couldn't compare. No one knew who owned Cloudrise Manor, only that its owner was fabulously wealthy, with investments in every industry, but no family company of their own. Everything was handled by a team of top-tier butlers and stewards.

No one had ever seen the owner. Their family's true identity was unknown.

Arabella assumed Alfred was just driving her up to see the view. She expected they'd pass by and head down to the other side of the mountain.

Instead, Alfred turned the car through the gates into the museum-like estate.

Under the sun, water danced in the central fountain, catching the light.

The sculpture at its center was a modern masterpiece, clearly worth a fortune.

Even Arabella, accustomed to valuables and authenticity, knew it was top-tier.

Alfred brought the car to a smooth stop right before the castle's grand entrance.

Before Arabella could process it, Alfred got out and walked around to open her door like a gentleman. ""Arabella, welcome home.""

As he spoke, two lines of more than twenty servants flanking the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison. ""Welcome home, Ms. Hamilton!""

For a second, Arabella thought she'd walked onto a movie set.

""Alfred... this... is my home?""

Is this for real?

Even with ample funds in her own accounts and plenty of experience with grand settings and important people, Arabella was stunned.

She had prepared herself for a run-down house, unemployed parents and brothers, and the responsibility of supporting them all.

But she never expected a complete 180-degree turn.

My family is the legendary, mysterious top-tier wealthy family of Doranor City?


Chapter 5 What if We Scared Her?


Seeing Arabella's surprised expression, Alfred gave an indulgent smile. ""Yes, this is your home. Come on in. Mom and Dad are waiting.""

Arabella took a steadying breath and got out of the car. Looking at the extravagant red carpet at her feet, she stepped onto it a bit awkwardly. ""This is... quite a welcome.""

Alfred smiled, ""It's only right.""

After all the hardship she has endured for so many years, her first homecoming deserves to be special.

As they spoke, two figures rushed out from behind the tall doors at the end of the carpet.

""Is that Arabella?"" Came an excited, melodic female voice.

Arabella looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple but elegant dress approaching. She was beautiful and graceful.

Though past forty, she was impeccably maintained, radiating a star-like, gentle charm.

Beside her was a distinguished-looking middle-aged man, tall and handsome, bearing a strong resemblance to Alfred.

Arabella knew instantly—these were her parents.

Seeing them, the perfect image of an aristocratic couple, her image of ""unemployed drifters"" completely vanished.

Carter, could you be any more incompetent?

Is this what 'unemployed drifter' looks like?

By now, Florence Hamilton had reached Arabella. She took Arabella's hands in hers, her eyes instantly welling up. ""It's true. This is my daughter. Jonathan, look how much she resembles me.""

Jonathan Hamilton studied Arabella's face, so similar to Florence's, and nodded in wonder. ""Yes. The likeness is remarkable.""

Florence had been an internationally renowned star in her day, known for her extraordinary beauty.

At first, they'd never doubted Naomi Hamilton was their biological child.

But after puberty, as Naomi grew to look less and less like either Florence or Jonathan, whispers began. They, too, started to sense something was off.

They had just begun looking into it when the Macdonald family discovered the mix-up. The police compared their DNA with Arabella's, confirming she was their biological daughter.

They'd planned to run another test after she arrived. But now, seeing her, it seemed unnecessary.

Arabella was the spitting image of a young Florence.

Without a trace of makeup, she was stunningly beautiful in a pure, natural way.

Arabella was equally surprised by how much she looked like her mother.

No wonder Freya and I were never close. I was cute as a child and grew up looking nothing like her. She probably suspected I wasn't hers all along.

Once that suspicion took root, Arabella investigated and found out the truth.

It seemed this time, she had truly found her birth parents.

""Dad, Mom, it's windy out here. Let's go inside,"" Alfred suggested gently.

Being a seaside estate, the ocean breeze was strong. He didn't want Florence catching a chill.

Florence nodded eagerly. ""You're right! I was so excited I forgot. Come inside, dear.""

Still holding Arabella's hand, she led her through the doors.

Feeling Florence's soft, warm hand, Arabella felt an unexpected wave of warmth.

Growing up despised by Freya, she'd rarely experienced a mother's care and affection.

Now she realized a mother's touch could feel so comforting.

The group moved inside.

They passed through an entrance hall that felt more like an art gallery. The walls were lined with paintings, each flanked by ceramic or sculptural pieces.

Passing one particular ceramic artwork, Arabella paused.

This piece... looks familiar.

Noticing Arabella's gaze, Florence said, ""Arabella, do you like it?""

Arabella hesitated, then nodded awkwardly.

Like it? Well, I liked it enough when I made it. Or I wouldn't make it.

But she made so many pieces each month, bundling them off to her studio assistant to sell. This one had taken her, at most, three hours.

To think it ended up in my own parents' home... What a coincidence.

""If you like it, we can move it to your room later,"" Florence offered. ""It's a top work by a mysterious new artist. I bought it at a charity auction last month for eight million dollars. Not terribly expensive, but wonderfully creative.""

Arabella's mouth twitched.

Eight million dollars... 'Not terribly expensive'?

Even as one of Meridian District's top three merchants, the Macdonald family won't casually spend eight million dollars on such a small piece.

And it is just something I threw together.

Just how wealthy is my family?

They arrived in the grand living room.

A dozen servants stood in two lines.

One group held trays with various beverages—different types of coffee and juices. The other held trays of assorted pastries.

Florence guided Arabella past them, her voice soft. ""It's your first day home, sweetheart. I didn't know what you'd like to drink, so I had them prepare every type of coffee and juice. And these pastries are from the best patisserie in Doranor City. I got one of each flavor for you to try.""

Under Florence's expectant gaze, Arabella felt obliged to choose. She picked a hand-ground coffee and two pastries.

She said, ""I don't like things too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors look just right.""

Florence was delighted. ""I can't believe it! Even your tastes are like mine.""

It really is family. How did I not notice how different Naomi's preferences were?

The chosen servants presented the items, and the others dispersed.

Alfred said, ""Mom, Dad, I'm going to go change.""

Jonathan looked at his disheveled state and sighed, ""You're the leader of INTERPOL's Special Unit A now. What sort of case is this that has you personally leading the team to look like this? Had I known you were in this state, I wouldn't have let you pick up Arabella. What if we scared her?""

At his words, Alfred looked awkward. ""This was an international drug lord bust. It wasn't just me, even the...""

Another issue is hesitation. I’ll think about asking someone to grab coffee or study together, but I overthink it and talk myself out of it. Later I regret not trying and feel like I missed my chance.",2,1769149227.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

I did my first IVF round ever in December 2025, with (2) 3 day embryos. And after posting somewhere on Reddit (post attached) that it didn’t work because I had no symptoms, and I was spiraling, and I never saw a positive before for a year and a half, I thought something was really wrong with me, I was already planning my next cycle. I went back to drinking coffee and chocolate and ate what I wanted (I was on a healthy anti inflammatory diet)…

Until… I got a shocking positive on the day I was supposed to test!!! No symptom’s, no indication, NOTHING! Just a 19 on my beta. 

Doc said it was still too early and low and to keep repeating my tests. 

THEN…Went from 19 to 2500+ in less than 10 days!!

I went from nothing for a year and a half, to a positive on my first ever transfer!! And on 3 day embryos. 

Don’t lose hope. I wouldn’t have believed me even if I went back to the past and told myself.

1qkj7pr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkj7pr,Best way to test hair colors with AI (Nano Banana) before dyeing my hair?,"Honestly, are you also stuck in that uncertain phase about your hair color?

I really want a change, but I’m terrified of hating it. If the color turns out wrong, it’s not just a bad week—it’s months of seeing it in every photo, every shoot, every mirror. I keep going back and forth between going lighter, trying a copper shade, or doing something softer like a pastel pink, and then the second I think about actually booking an appointment, I just freeze.

Recently I started using Nano Banana’s image‑to‑image tool, and it’s the first thing that’s actually helped. I can upload a real photo of myself and tell it to only change the hair color—my face, hairline, makeup, and background all stay exactly the same. Seeing myself in different shades (creamy blonde, muted copper, dusty pastel pink, etc.) in the exact same pose and lighting has made it way easier to compare what actually suits me and what definitely doesn’t.

Has anyone else used Nano Banana (or something similar) to test hair colors before committing?

Any tips on:

how to word the prompts so it really only changes the hair, and what’s the best to get the most realistic result—and maybe finally cure this hair‑color decision paralysis?",1,1769148970.0,GeminiAI,0,1.0,False

Unsure if I'm just being selfish with this thinking but baby will typically nurse for a minimum of 40mins-1hr most feeds. I understand that some of this is probably comfort but it's very hit and miss on whether he'll be happy to come off the breast. He very rarely takes himself off anymore in an 'I'm done' motion so I typically have to call it and pry him off, hoping he is done. We've just started introducing a dummy just so I can get some relief at night and don't have to have him on indefinitely till he falls asleep.

I try to make feeds (especially night) as dull as possible (dark room, etc) so I'm also nice and bored throughout. I have larger breasts so I have to hold him in one hand and my breast with the other so can't do anything else while nursing. 

I just feel like this is really hindering us, I can't take him out regularly because if he wants to feed it's such a long process - going out for a coffee could mean sat there for an extra hour plus with him on me the whole time. 

As an example, he woke up this morning at 4.20am, I changed him, he fed for 1hr 20mins (tried to remove him multiple times), burped him, have to keep him upright for 30mins or he sicks everything up and it's now like 6.30am and he's still up, not wanting to settle and I'll have to do this all again in an hour or two...",1,1769148903.0,breastfeeding,0,1.0,False

1qkj2un,https://i.redd.it/lnzjve5wi1fg1.png,Motion Design Ads on YouTube in 2026: How Long Should They REALLY Be?,"Okay, listen up, folks. You think making a motion design ad is just “throw some colors, some 3D rotations, maybe a dancing logo, and boom—viral”? Nah. You also have to fight the YouTube algorithm, the viewer’s attention span, and the temptation to scroll to cat videos.

So, how long should your ad actually be in 2026? Buckle up, because I’ve done the “scientific research” (a.k.a. scrolled through 27 YouTube ads before my morning coffee).

Attention Spans Are Dead… Or Are They?

Fact: The average human attention span in 2026 is roughly the same as it was in 2025… because we’re all still scrolling TikTok in the bathroom.

Translation? Your ad has seconds, not minutes, to convince people your product isn’t just another 3D logo floating in space.

\---

🕒 How Long Should a Motion Design Ad Be?

Here’s the deal. YouTube ads come in all shapes and sizes, but motion designers are finally realizing: shorter isn’t just better—it’s essential.

I made a handy little table for my fellow design nerds (and yes, it’s optimized for mobile, because no one scrolls horizontally on Reddit… we’re not savages).

Ad Type	Ideal Length	Why It Works (Short, Sweet, Science-y)

Bumper Ads (non-skippable)	6 sec	Blink and you’ll miss it. Perfect for logos, taglines, tiny product flexes.

Skippable Ads (15–20 sec)	15 sec	Enough time to tease, show a product in motion, then hit them with a punchline.

Medium-Length Ads	30 sec	Show the magic: product + story + motion design jazz hands. Don’t drag—people skip.

Long-Form (60 sec)	45–60 sec	Rarely needed unless you’re selling a lifestyle, not a widget. Still, add humor, motion, and a CTA that doesn’t bore them.

Super Long Storytelling Ads	90 sec+	Only for epic storytelling or if you know your audience binge-watches cat fails. Seriously.

 Motion Design is a Seduction Game

Here’s the truth: motion design is basically flirting with your audience.

Too fast? They’re confused.

Too slow? They’re bored.

Just right? They’re emotionally invested… and clicking your CTA like it’s a dating app notification.

It’s a delicate dance, folks. Like salsa… but with 3D cubes and After Effects easing curves.

Pro Tips from a Designer Who Watches Too Many Ads

1. Front-load the hook: First 3 seconds = make them laugh, surprise them, or blow their minds with your 3D particle system.

2. Keep the story moving: Your ad is not a TED Talk—cut the fluff.

3. Test, test, test: Split-test 6 sec vs 15 sec vs 30 sec. You’ll be amazed how often people prefer “blink-and-you-miss-it” magic.

4. CTA at the end: Don’t bury your call-to-action under 20 seconds of swirling shapes.

\---

⚡ Final Verdict

If your motion design ad is longer than a TikTok trend, you’re doing it wrong.

Think short, punchy, funny, visually mesmerizing, and optimized for mobile. And if you want to go long—make it so entertaining that even your grandma clicks the CTA.

So remember, fellow motion designers:

2026 is the year of speed, sass, and style. Make your ads short enough to keep attention, but flashy enough to leave an impression. And never, ever forget—the algorithm is watching.",1,1769148532.0,LogoMotionGraphics,0,1.0,False

Just organised it as a dinner with some girl I met a few times before and not specifically a date but it ended up being at a romantic place. Conversation flowed freely.  Sooo much in common, even our weirdnesses. it was perhaps a little one-sided with me mostly talking about her and very little about myself, but I was always taught to talk about her and not me unless she asked. We shared food with each other. The bill came and she said she wanted to stay longer but we had to leave after 20 mins because it was closing so we went for coffee. 

Anyway, cut long story short, at the end we had to obviously go our separate ways and she just lingered staring at me with a smile on her face. I hugged her and said I had a good night, got a one armed hug, and nothing. Just smiling and staring as if waiting for something.

There was no attempt at physical escalation the whole night (hard to do across a table) nor had she really made any romantic hints or compliments but I fancied her and didn't know what to do...but instead of leading with a clean exit, I was so exhausted from the earlier chat that I ended up talking shit for 5 mins about how much I liked her and was looking for a relationship and at least wanted to be friends but needed to know if she wanted more...and she just stood there until I said ""For now let's just be friends then"" and she agreed. it was so weird and I was so awkward.

But she still texted shortly after to say she'd had a really good night, highlighted her favourite parts and thanked me for everything. I reciprocated and the conversation ended. Haven't spoken since then but still engaging lightly on social media (story views...) and I'm not blocked or unfollowed.

 I was revered in my last section which gave me the opportunity to leave and become part of a more challenging section. This is great except for the fact that I am undermined at every turn and anything I do or say gets telephoned to the head honcho and I get a verbal lashing or put on details. I've grown cold to some of my coworkers who are the main reporters and it sucks because I want to be friendly. I've heard rumors that there is favoritism where I work (and outside to a degree as these people have roots) I innocently tried to not believe them but at this point the writing is on the wall. Being a good, hard worker is barely enough. My PT is great, I'm taking extra classes, mos related and out, I volunteer for duties and tdy but I feel like I'm still harshly criticized. A peer and I could be doing the same thing, the same by the book method and I'd be hyper analysed while they get a quick once over on their marry way. 

I'd like to be moved back to my old section but the person who makes that decision is besties with my boss so I don't think it will go very well and I know it will make it's way back to my boss.

At the time, I got it mainly for its UHD video capabilities, but I do a whole lot less video nowadays. (More likely to use the FS700U + Shogun Inferno setup for that anyway.)

Lately, I mostly use my α6500 for kind of a mix of things, proposals or smaller weddings for friends, car meets, some landscape or street on little road trips with friends.  And a disproportionate amount of pictures of my cat  :)

I still rather like my α6500 and rx100 mkIV, but I've been considering getting something a little newer with some more resolution to work with.  I find I miss eye focus a lot and my vision has gotten a bit worse so I have trouble doing manual focus via the viewfinder and rely largely on AF now.  I've been printing photos larger (8.5x11 prints for my photo albums I keep in the coffee table or larger prints, as much as 30x40, for the hallway on photos I really like) and definitely wouldn't mind having some more pixels to work with.

I have a few lenses that would be compatible with a full-frame body already so I've been thinking about jumping up to an α7cii or α7v.  They're a lot more expensive bodies than anything I've owned prior - I worry that this might just be GAS in action.  I feel like I'd otherwise be plenty happy with a secondhand a7iv if it weren't for how much praise I've heard about the AI autofocus features on the newer cameras (more cat pictures!!).  I'd like to get a better landscape setup for some bigger road trips I'm planning with friends in the next year or two. Current lenses I have for context, would want to pick up something around the 16-20mm range for landscapes on a full frame

full frame: Sony sel50f18f, Rokinon IO3518-E, Viltrox B07VCQWDNT

aps-c: Meike B07N1LK2FB, Sony sel50f18, Sigma B077BWD2BB, Sigma B01C3SCKI6

there are a few others like the sel55210, SEL18200, sigma B00BPZD0M4 that sit in a bin and never get used

  
Does it make sense to upgrade to a newer body, and if so, would a 7v or 7cii be money well spent or just way overkill for a hobbyist like me? I played with both at the store for a bit and didn't immediately have a strong preference between the two form factors.",1,1769148385.0,SonyAlpha,0,1.0,False

I finally stopped trying to ""grind"" my way out of a legal hole, took my brother's advice and called the specialists at Anthem Tax Services to handle the heavy lifting. Having that team deal with the revenue officers meant I could actually focus on my presentation without feeling like a fraud. It turns out I didn’t need more coffee or a better mindset.

Still can’t move on from our wedding. 🤍
It may not have been perfect, but it was beautiful, meaningful, and overflowing with love and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

Sharing here the list of our wedding suppliers who were truly worth every penny. Their talent, dedication, and love made our day unforgettable. Di kayo magsisisi choosing them. ✨

Coordinator: The Weekend Planner – Ms. Kim Vicente
From prenup to wedding day, sobrang top-tier ng coordination services. Her attention to detail is on another level, sobrang bilis mag-respond, very hands-on, and super organized. During both our prenup and wedding day, never akong na-stress at all. As in smooth lang lahat. Sobrang galing!

HMUA: Ken Hair and Make Up Artistry – Ken & Greggy
They are really, really great. From prenup to wedding day, sobrang ganda ng hair and makeup ko. What touched me the most was how they kept giving me advice on what to do and how to enjoy the moment. Super stressed ako the night before the wedding, pero during my makeup session, they kept reminding me to relax and enjoy my wedding day, kasi sayang daw if I don’t. That meant so much to me. 🥹

Photo and Video Team: Sten Bautista Weddings
Grabe! sobrang solid! From prenup to wedding day, all our photos, save-the-date videos, and especially our SDE, ang gaganda. They really pulled off what we envisioned. Sobrang galing talaga! Siguro 10 times or more ko na napanood yung SDE namin, ganun siya kaganda. 🤍
Super flexible din nila kahit ang daming nangyari during prenup, game na game pa rin. Ang saya nila kasama sa shoot. Best photo and video team!

Ceremony & Florist: Bryan Rowell Jano
Thank you for bringing our wedding vision to life. The ceremony setup and florals were stunning, elegant, and full of emotion exactly what I dreamed of. Plus, my floral bouquet… sobrang gandaaa 🤍🤍🤍

Reception Stylist: R.I Design
We got the R.I Design collaboration package with Madriaga Catering, and all I can say is wow. Kahit namili lang kami ng design from their templates, ang ganda pa rin ng naging reception namin. 🥹

Photoman: The Roving Photo Studio – Photoman
All our guests enjoyed taking photos sa photoman and sobrang ganda ng quality ng pagkakaprint ng photos  even the raw files ang ganda na. 

Catering: Madriaga Catering 
Di ko na ata mabilang ilang beses kami nag food tasting dito, consistent ang lasa and all I can say is that our guests enjoy the food. 

Crewmeals: Little Pav's
Sobrang bilis. Sobrang on time and delivery and masarap yung crewmeals super affordable pa 🤍

Our Crowd's Favorite Food Carts:
- Potato Corner 
- Aysauce Food Cart
- Mang Bert's Ice cream
- Kape Benito Community Cafe (Coffee Cart)

Selfie Mirror: Mirror Everything 
Sobrang ganda nang setup and also they accommodate changes based on my preferences. 

Venue: Emerald Events Place 
Of course, the best overlooking wedding venue in Antipolo 🤍 a lot of our guests enjoyed the view medyo mahal lang but the price speaks for itself. 

Prep Venue: Casa Mi Ana 
If you are looking for a larger group na iaaccomodate before your wedding day. I will recommend this place. Maganda yung place Pero iilan lang yung rooms na hindi double Deck type. Also the bridal room which is the  largest room in the resort. Nasa 3rd floor 😂 so our families and suppliers napagod kaka-akyat baba. But the place is really good. 

Other suppliers that you might consider booking:

Entourage HMUA: Charisse Ann Darullo (she's good and affordable, ganda nung make up ng entourage ko)

Ceremony Chairs Rentals: ARC's Chair Rentals

Lights and Sounds and Led Wall: Anyayahan lights and sounds (siguro nabitin lang ako because I was expecting we will be having an after party kaso bigla nilang pinatay yung sounds.  Maybe our fault na di kami nagsabi mag extend kami or kahit nag ask man lang sila if we want to extend the service, anyway we still enjoyed our wedding) 

Overall, I enjoyed our wedding. Sarap sa feeling na tapos na nairaos na. There's a bit of regret but it doesn't matter anymore. What matters to me is that how we enjoyed and celebrated our wedding full of love and joy.

Extraction is Density.



1. 서론: 커피는 숙련된 노동인가, 설계된 시스템인가?

에스프레소 추출에서 ‘채널링’은 바리스타의 숙명처럼 여겨져 왔다. 

많은 이들이 탬핑의 강도나 분쇄도 조절이라는 개인의 숙련도에 의지해 이 문제를 해결하려 하지만, 인간의 감각은 매 순간 변수 앞에 노출된다. 

지난 15년간 현장에서 연구해온 결론은 명확하다. 커피는 숙련된 노동이 아닌, 철저히 계산된 밀도 시스템에 의해 추출되어야 한다. 

본고에서는 바스켓의 기하학적 특성과 이종 규격 툴을 결합하여 내부 밀도 지도를 능동적으로 설계하는 

\*\*'채널링 유도 기법(Density Guiding Method, D.G.M)'\*\*을 소개하고자 한다.



전통적 추출 이론에서 볶음도, 도징량, 분쇄도, 레벨링, 템핑은 모두 변수다. 이를 부정하는 사람은 없을 것이다. 

추출은 밀도라는 대전제 아래 채널링 유도 기법을 통하여 하나씩 상수화 하여 결국 분쇄도 하나만을 남길것이다. 

앞으로 추출은 분쇄도 하나만을 조절하는 방법으로 바뀔것이다. 억지 같은가? 



1. Introduction: Skilled Labor or Designed System?

In espresso extraction, ""channeling"" has long been regarded as the inevitable fate of a barista. Many attempt to solve this by relying on individual skills, such as tamping pressure or grind adjustment, but human senses are constantly exposed to variables. After 15 years of field research, my conclusion is clear: extraction should not be a matter of skilled labor, but a strictly calculated system of density. In this paper, I introduce the 'Density Guiding Method (D.G.M)', which actively designs an internal density map by combining basket geometry with multi-spec tools.



In traditional extraction theory, roast level, dose, grind size, leveling, and tamping are all variables. No one would deny this. Under the grand premise that ""Extraction is Density,"" D.G.M will turn these variables into constants one by one, eventually leaving only the grind size. In the future, extraction will shift toward a method where only the grind size is adjusted. Does that sound far-fetched?



2. 실험 및 추출 조건

Experimental and Extraction Conditions



볶음도: 중볶음 (Roast Level: Medium Roast)



도징량: 19g - 20g (Dose: 19g - 20g)



추출 타겟: 리스트레또(Ristretto) 투샷, 스파웃 15ml + 15ml 크레마 포함 30ml (Target: Double Ristretto (Spouted: 15ml + 15ml / Total 30ml including crema)



표준 추출 시간: 20초 \~ 24초 (Standard Extraction Time: 20s \~ 24s)



분쇄도: 위 범위를 충족하는 범위 내 (Grind Size: Within the range that satisfies the above parameters)



3. 본론: 테이퍼드 구조를 장악하는 ‘이종 규격 설계’

3. Main Body: ""Multi-Spec Design"" Dominating Tapered Structures



13년 된 스파웃(Spout) 포터필터(라마르조꼬 구형 포타필터)를 사용하는 환경에서는 퍽 내부의 물리적 변화를 시각적으로 확인할 수 없다. 

따라서 물이 흐르기 전 이미 모든 저항값이 결정되는 \*\*‘사전 설계(Pre-design)’\*\*에 집중해야 한다.



In an environment using a 13-year-old spouted portafilter (old La Marzocco model), physical changes inside the puck cannot be visually confirmed. Therefore, the focus must be on ""Pre-design,"" where all resistance values are determined before the water even flows.



3-1. 외벽 기초 공사 (The Foundation): 먼저 58mm V-Type 레벨툴을 사용하여 가루의 전체 수평을 잡고 평탄화 한다. 

58mm V-Type 레벨툴은 깊이 10mm이다. 평탄화시 턱 아래 분쇄된 원두가 배치된다.



The Foundation: First, use a 58mm V-Type leveling tool to level and flatten the grounds. The 58mm V-Type tool has a depth of 10mm. Upon leveling, the grounds are positioned below the basket rim.



3-2. 중앙 코어 형성 (V-Core Design): 핵심은 54mm V-Type 툴의 투입이다. 

툴을 바스켓 정중앙에 안착시킨 후, 일정한 수직 하중을 가하며 회전한다. 

54mm V-Type 레벨툴은 깊이가 12mm 이다.

58mm캡과 54mm 베이스를 결합한 하이브리드 툴을 이용하여 바스켓 림에 닿을때까지 누른다.  

누른 압력 그대로 45도로 4회전 혹은 90도로 2회전 시킨다. 45도일때는 4의 배수로 90도일때는 2의 배수가 회전수가 되어야 한다. 360도 회전을 지켜라. 

하이브리드 툴은 상단캡이 가이드 역할을 수행함으로써 숙련도와 상관없이 기계적으로 정중앙을 타격할수 있다. 

일정한 속도를 유지하며 회전시킴으로서 원두 가루가 V-날개를 따라 외벽으로 고르게 재배치되도록 유도 한다.



V-Core Design: The core of this method is the introduction of the 54mm V-Type tool.



After seating the tool in the exact center of the basket, rotate it while applying a constant vertical load. The 54mm V-Type leveling tool is set to a depth of 12mm. Using a hybrid tool—constructed by combining a 58mm cap with a 54mm base—press down until the cap makes full contact with the basket rim.



While maintaining constant pressure, rotate the tool either four times at 45-degree increments or twice at 90-degree increments. The number of rotations must be a multiple of 4 for 45 degrees and a multiple of 2 for 90 degrees. Ensure a full 360-degree rotation is completed. The 58mm upper cap of the hybrid tool serves as a mechanical guide, ensuring that the tool strikes the dead center every time, regardless of the user's skill level. By maintaining a consistent rotational speed, the coffee grounds are guided along the V-shaped wings and are uniformly redistributed toward the outer walls.



3-3. 58mm 툴로 1회전 상단부 마무리



Finishing: Complete the top surface with one rotation using the 58mm tool.



3-4. 물리적 메커니즘: 라마르조꼬형 바스켓처럼 하단으로 갈수록 좁아지는 테이퍼드(Tapered) 구조는 58mm 툴이 닿지 못하는 사각지대를 가지고 있다. 

54mm 베이스는 이 좁아지는 구간을 따라 침투한다. 

V형 날개는 가루를 측면으로 투사하여 외벽 밀착력을 극대화한다.



Physical Mechanism: Tapered structures that narrow toward the bottom, like La Marzocco-style baskets, have ""dead zones"" that 58mm tools cannot reach. The 54mm base penetrates deep into this narrowing section. The V-shaped wings project the powder laterally, maximizing adhesion to the outer walls.

Most 58mm tools cannot reach the effective compression zone of a tapered basket. By using a 54mm base, we eliminate the 'Dead Zone' at the bottom curve, ensuring maximum edge-to-wall adhesion where 58mm tools fail.



3-5. 추출양상(Extraction Patterns): 초반 채널링처럼 터졌다가 잠시후 1자로 안정되는 것을 볼수도 있을 것이다.

초반에 채널링을 모방한 터뷸런스(난류)가 관찰될 수 있다. 이는 물이 수직 흐름으로 안착하기 전, 코어에 의해 재분배되는 일시적인 상태이다.



Extraction Patterns: You may observe an initial burst that resembles channeling, which quickly stabilizes into a straight, steady stream shortly after. Initial turbulence that mimics channeling can be observed; this is a temporary state where the water is being redistributed by the core before it settles into a consistent vertical flow.





4. 하이브리드 레벨툴 제작 가이드 (Technical Guide: Building the D.G.M Tool)

준비물: 동일 브랜드의 58mm 마카롱형 레벨툴 2개, 54mm 1개. (나사산 호환을 위해 반드시 동일 브랜드 제품 권장)

제   작: 58mm 툴의 상단 캡(Cap)을 분리하여, 54mm 툴의 베이스(Base)와 결합.

원   리: 58mm 캡은 바스켓 림에 걸리는 \*\*'스토퍼(Stopper)'\*\*이자 '센터 가이드' 역할을 수행하며, 54mm 베이스는 바스켓 하단 좁은 구간까지 깊숙이 침투하여 \*\*'코어 밀도'\*\*를 완성.

세   팅: 58mm 오리지널 툴은 10mm 깊이로, 하이브리드 툴은 12mm 깊이로 세팅하여 물리적 하방 압력을 상수화.



To implement this method, you don't need expensive custom equipment. You can build a high-precision system using off-the-shelf components.



Materials   : Prepare two 58mm Macaron-style leveling tools and one 54mm Macaron-style leveling tool from the same brand. (Same brand is highly recommended to ensure thread compatibility.)

Assembly  : Detach the upper cap from one of the 58mm tools and combine it with the base of the 54mm tool.

Principle   : The 58mm cap acts as a 'Stopper' and a 'Center Guide' that sits on the basket rim, while the 54mm base penetrates deep into the narrow bottom section of the basket to establish the 'Core Density.'

Calibration: Set the original 58mm tool to a depth of 10mm and the hybrid tool to a depth of 12mm to turn the physical downward pressure into a constant.



5. 핵심 원리: 유체역학적 역설 – ‘지연과 집중’

5. Core Principle: Hydrodynamic Paradox – ""Delay and Concentration""



   D.G.M의 핵심은 물의 본성을 이용한 \*\*'깔때기 효과(Funnel Effect)'\*\*에 있다. 

   

The core of D.G.M lies in the ""Funnel Effect,"" utilizing the nature of water. 



5-1. 저항의 재배치: 유입된 물은 저항이 높은 중앙부를 만나 일시적으로 주변부로 분산된다.



 Redistribution of Resistance: Incoming water hits the ""high-density core"" and is temporarily dispersed to the periphery.



5-2. 경로의 유도: 주변부로 퍼진 물은 바스켓 특유의 경사면을 타고 다시 중앙 하단으로 모여들게 된다.



Guiding the Path: Water spread to the periphery follows the basket's slope and converges back toward the bottom center.



5-3.완벽한 성분 추출: 물이 수직으로 쏟아지는 ‘폭포’가 아니라, 퍽 전체를 촘촘히 적시며 길을 찾는 ‘늪’과 같은 환경이 조성된다.  



Perfect Extraction: Instead of a ""waterfall"" crashing down, an environment like a ""swamp"" is created where water meticulously saturates the entire puck. 



5-4. 볶음도는 중앙코어에 의해 물리적 저항의 주도권을 빼앗긴다. 이에 따라 맛의 변수가 될뿐 흐름의 변수는 되지 못한다. 



Roast Level Neutralization: The roast level loses its dominance over physical resistance due to the central core. Consequently, it remains a variable for flavor but ceases to be a variable for flow.



6. 결론 : 추출은 밀도이며 설계된 시스템은 배신하지 않는다. 

6. Conclusion: Extraction is Density; Designed Systems Do Not Betray



   도징량 : 도징컵으로 상수화가 된다.

   볶음도 : 시스템이 정상 작동한다면 볶음도는 더이상 영향을 미치지 못하는 상수화로 수렴한다. 

   레벨링/ 템핑: 이종규격틀로 인해 상수화 된다. 하이브리드툴이 바스켓 림에 닿음으로서 하방압력은 12mm로 강제된다. 보디빌더라도 더 못 누르고 초보자라고 덜 누를수 없다. 



   이제 남은것은 분쇄도 하나뿐이다. 



   이제 시스템은 갖추졌다. 이 시스템 위에 어떤 맛을 그릴지는 사용자들의 몫이다. 어떤 맛의 그림을 그리겠는가? 그럴려면 타겟 추출량과 초도 변해야 되겟지?



Dose: Constant, through the use of a dosing cup.

Roast Level: Converges into a constant that no longer disrupts the flow if the system operates correctly.

Leveling/Tamping: Constant, through the use of multi-spec tools. By the hybrid tool making contact with the basket rim, the tamping depth is force-locked at 12mm. Even a bodybuilder cannot push further, and a beginner cannot push less. Physical limit, not human strength, dictates the pressure.



Now, only one variable remains: Grind Size.



The system is now complete. What kind of flavor profile you paint on this canvas is entirely up to the user. To paint your own masterpiece, wouldn't the target yield and extraction time need to evolve as well?



7. \[부록: 미완의 확신 – VST에 대하여\]

7. \[Appendix: Incomplete Conviction – Regarding VST\]

 

애석하게도 필자의 작업실에는 VST 바스켓이 없다. 13년 된 낡은 장비가 내가 마주한 현실이다. 

따라서 누군가 ""이 기법이 VST에서도 통하겠는가?""라고 묻는다면, 나의 대답은 이렇다.



""가능할 것으로 본다. 다만, 실증하지 못했기에 주장하지 않을 뿐이다.""



하지만 유체의 흐름과 밀도의 상관관계라는 물리적 법칙은 도구를 가리지 않는다. 

VST가 정밀한 타공과 수직 구조를 가졌을지언정, 물은 여전히 저항이 낮은 곳을 찾아 흐르려 할 것이기 때문이다. 

오히려 VST의 극단적인 추출 속도를 제어하는 데 있어 D.G.M의 '코어'는 가장 강력한 브레이크이자 유도선이 될 것이라 확신한다.

여기서 뇌피셜을 더하자면.. 58미리라면.. 55미리 이하면 가능할거로 보인다.



Regrettably, there is no VST basket in my workshop. 13-year-old equipment is my reality. Therefore, if someone asks, ""Will this work on a VST?"", my answer is: ""I believe so. However, I won't claim it as fact since I haven't proven it yet."" But physical laws—the correlation between fluid flow and density—do not discriminate by tool. In fact, I am confident that D.G.M’s ""core"" will serve as the most powerful brake and guide for controlling VST's extreme flow rates. To add a bit of speculation... for 58mm, I think anything under 55mm would work.



8. 나의 실사용 사례

   첫 타겟팅 추출에서 19그람 90도 4회전을 한다. 25초가 넘어가면 일단 회전수를 2회전으로 줄인다. 그래도 25초를 넘어가면 분쇄도를 한칸 굵게간다. 

\[등속 회전 팁 추가\] 만약 등속 회전이 어렵다면, 캡이 림에 닿게 누른 후 손목을 미리 원하는 각도만큼 돌려놓고 그냥 풀어라. 

억지로 돌리는 것보다 손목을 원상태로 '푸는' 동작에서 의외로 훨씬 일정한 등속 회전이 만들어진다.



Practical Application Case For the initial target extraction, I use 19g and apply 4 rotations at 90 degrees. If the extraction time exceeds 25 seconds, I first reduce the rotation count to 2. If it still exceeds 25 seconds despite the reduction, I then adjust the grind size one click coarser.

   Tip for Constant Rotational Speed: > If you find it difficult to maintain a constant speed while rotating, try this: After pressing down until the cap makes full contact with the rim, pre-rotate (twist) your wrist to your desired starting angle first. Then, simply ""release"" your wrist back to its natural position. You will find that ""releasing"" the tension allows for a much more consistent and constant rotational speed than trying to force a rotation.



9. 마치며



이 시스템은 ""완벽한 한 잔""을 만들기 위한 시스템이 아니다. ""버리지 않을 한 잔""을 만들기 위한 시스템이다. 

문제가 발생했을 때, 이 시스템은 즉각적이고 논리적인 대처를 가능하게 할 것이다. 당신은 더 이상 추측 할 필요가 없다.  설계된 시스템을 조정할 뿐이다. 본고의 목표는 추출을 ""운과 노동""의 영역에서 ""지속 가능한 관리와 즉각적 수정""의 영역으로 전환하는 것이다. 



""추출은 밀도다""라는 전제에 채널링 유도기법(D.G.M)시스템을 제언한다. 적용은 각자의 몫이다. 숫자에 매몰되지 말고 시스템을 이해하며, 더 많은 창의적 파생이 나오기를 진심으로 기대한다.



This system is not about chasing a single ""god shot."" It is about ensuring ""a cup that never fails.""



When an issue arises, this system allows for an immediate, logical response. No more guessing. No more relying on the ""feeling"" of your wrist. You simply calibrate a pre-designed system. The goal of D.G.M is to shift extraction from the realm of ""luck and labor"" to ""sustainable management and instant correction.""



Under the grand premise that ""Extraction is Density,"" I propose the Density Guiding Method (D.G.M) system. Its application is now in your hands. Do not be enslaved by the numbers; instead, understand the underlying system. It is my sincere hope that this framework inspires more creative derivatives and evolutions from practitioners everywhere.

I've left out a ton of details from this story that highlight the up and downs of this incognito relationship. I tried to supply a little background so you all can understand how everything started. TIA for reading.

Last year, my gf (28f) and I(27m) set up her best friend(29) with a friend of mine(28). We thought they'd be good together. They ended up dating briefly. In this few month period, I'm getting the details about their relationship from my gf and my friend is being extremely controlling and showing a high level of insecurity, he's being awful to her. 2 months or so later, I broke up with my gf. Things between us were far beyond fixing and we both knew that. I had been checked out mentally for months. We broke up on good terms. They break up a month or so later.

My (now) ex has been supporting her best friend and encourages her to reach out to me. I have given her advice before so this was nothing out of the ordinary. We meet up for drinks and she brought a notebook of discussion topics with her. We have a little bit of a rapport. The last two years, she's been friends with my ex and we went on several double dates. However, I didn't meet her until the night we set her up with my friend.

We kept finding ourselves off topic, mild flirting, it's just easy to talk to her. At times she stopped herself from touching my arm. We had instant chemistry. We look at the time and realize we've been chatting for 5 hours. She thanks me for talking with her about this, I give her a hug and we go our separate ways.

A few days later I get a text from her and she's asking me more questions, to which I respond, and then the conversation turns into talking about random things. We're just friends. I even told her about a barista I want to ask out. She was all for it and wanted to help me with a plan. My plan was to go into the coffee shop, hoping she'd take my order so I could strike up a conversation and hopefully get her name. She said just getting her name is a good place to start. However, every time I'd go in there she wouldn't take my order or she'd be busy. This went on for a few weeks so I just moved on. During this time we've been hanging out once per week, behind everyone's back and I realized I really enjoy the time I spend with my ex's best friend.

Since we're friends, I tempted her with a complex story so I could see her again. She took the bait and we met for drinks. She shows up wearing this incredibly cute outfit. It doesn't help that she is completely my type; Blue eyes, dark hair, she's in shape, smart, beautiful, and funny. Our chemistry was electric that night, it felt like a date.

Fast forward a month and we're now seeing each other, nothing official, no feelings have been shared. We're having fun and keeping it low key. We know this impacts people in our lives. I distanced myself from my friend because I don't want to be associated with a guy who treats women poorly. She hasn't distanced herself from my ex and is still hanging out with her. My ex is not over me, she's obsessing and she suspects something is happening between her and me. She's saying nasty things like, ""the next person he sees is just gonna be there to warm his bed"" and ""if I find out you two are seeing each other, I'm never speaking to either of you ever again.""

A few months later, it's the summer. I travel for work and for my hobby in the summer. The only time I have is on occasional weekends and she made sure to soak up my time like a sponge. We grew closer every time we saw each other. We were great friends, teasing and laughing all night, our physical chemistry was amazing too. Our goals are in sync, we both have our own hobbies and interests, everything that should feel easy, was easy. She admired me and I know she wanted us. We would facetime or talk on the phone a few nights a week while I was working out of state. I had to check in because I noticed how our situation was affecting her. So while we were chatting on the phone, I gave her an out. I told her ""I don't like that you're stressed out about the situation with my ex. I just want you to know, there's no hard feelings if you can't handle this anymore."" She doubled down and made it clear that she wants me. We reciprocated feelings for the first time that night, roughly 5 months into seeing each other. We are a great fit on so many levels.

We broke up in mid November, after an emotional week of her coming to terms with having to choose. I never pressured her to make a decision. Fuck, 4 days before she broke up with me, she tells me she wants a hobby that's just ours, something we can share. God dammit, I wanted that too. All I wanted was to be there for her and support her. Her reason being, now that my ex is finally better, i.e. seeing someone else, she doesn't want to miss out on doing fun things with her, like going on double dates. Says she keeps making horrible decisions, she doesn't want to lose me and ""thinks the world of me"" but just needs a friend rn. That's bullshit and yeah, you just made another horrible decision. 

We haven't spoken since she ended things and I've been pissed off and sad ever since. She made it seem like she wanted to solve this puzzle with me, then pulled the rug. I have an awesome new job, I'm good looking, and I'm in great physical shape. I've completely leveled up my life since she gave up. 

My friend reached out to me and wanted to grab a drink. So I agreed, tells me he feels awful about how he treated his ex and is in therapy. How he's still heartbroken over her, despite him being the one that ended the relationship. I'm happy for him that he's identified this problem and taking steps to fix it.

My ex is posting pictures with my now most recent ex saying how much she values the friends in her life, etc.

This messy situation has me thinking about the type of person I want to be. I would rather tell the truth than live a lie, even if it means I lose a friend. I can't hang out with him and hold this over his head. The problem is, my ex, my friend, and I share a niche hobby and are around the same people. I know the word would eventually get around to my ex. Who would probably flip out. Though, if she was truly happy with her new bf, then she wouldn't care who I date, even if it is her best friend. I really think she's scared of what we had, she chose me for 7 months... then ran away when we got close. 

I wouldn't be doing this for vengeance. I don't want to ruin her life. Part of me is saying she should have a fair warning but the majority doesn't want to reach out. I feel like I'm protecting her from this lie and I don't want to carry this burden anymore. I'm conflicted, I feel like if I do nothing, I'll explode. Did I pass this moral test? I'm sure some will say no, but all is fair in love and war.

Let me be clear upfront: I'm not selling anything in this post, and I'm skeptical of most ""double your T"" claims too. But I tracked everything with bloodwork, so here's what actually happened.

**Starting stats (age 36):**

* Total T: 347 ng/dL (trash tier)
* Waking up exhausted despite 7-8 hours in bed
* Zero morning wood (hadn't had it in years)
* Motivation was non-existent
* Libido was a joke
* Relationships suffered because I was irritable and checked out

**12 weeks later:**

* Total T: 718 ng/dL (confirmed by second test)
* Waking up before alarm, actually refreshed
* Morning wood 5-6 days per week
* Energy consistent throughout the day
* Actually want to do things again

**What Changed? Sleep Architecture.**

Not ""sleep more"" or ""go to bed earlier"" - actual sleep QUALITY optimization.

Here's the thing everyone misses: **You can be in bed for 8 hours and still have dogshit sleep.**

I was getting maybe 45 minutes of deep sleep per night (tracked via Oura ring). That's when testosterone is actually produced. For context, you need 90-120 minutes minimum.

# The Testosterone Optimizer SLEEP Protocol (No BS Version)

**1. Consistent Bedtime (Non-Negotiable)**

**What I did:**

* Picked 10:30pm as my bedtime, 6:30am wake time
* Stuck to it within 30 minutes EVERY NIGHT (yes, weekends too)
* Set a 10pm alarm as ""start winding down"" reminder

**Why it matters:** Your circadian rhythm isn't a suggestion - it's biological law. Inconsistent sleep times destroy testosterone production even if you get enough hours. Your body doesn't know what to optimize for.

**Reality check:** First two weeks sucked. I felt like a boring grandpa going to bed at 10:30 on Saturday. But my body adapted, and the results were undeniable.

**2. Morning Sunlight (The Game-Changer)**

**What I did:**

* 10-15 minutes outside within 30 minutes of waking
* No sunglasses during this time
* Didn't matter if cloudy - still went out
* Just stood on my balcony with coffee, nothing complicated

**Why it matters:** Morning light sets your circadian rhythm and triggers cortisol spike at the RIGHT time (morning). This creates proper cortisol rhythm, which directly affects testosterone. 



>**Evening cortisol = killed testosterone. Morning cortisol = optimized testosterone.**



**Science:** Light hits your retina → signals suprachiasmatic nucleus → regulates melatonin production 14-16 hours later → deep sleep happens → testosterone produced during deep sleep.

**Reality check:** This felt stupid at first. Standing outside doing ""nothing"" seemed like pseudoscience. But my Oura data showed deep sleep increased by 30+ minutes within a week of consistent morning light.



**3. Evening Supplement Stack (Calming the Wired Brain)**

My brain wouldn't shut off at night. Racing thoughts, replaying conversations, planning tomorrow - classic sympathetic nervous system dominance.

**My stack (taken 1-2 hours before bed):**

* Magnesium Glycinate: 400mg (calms nervous system, most people are deficient)
* L-Theanine: 200mg (takes edge off without making you drowsy)
* Apigenin: 50mg (from chamomile, mild sedative effect)
* Glycine: 3g (improves sleep quality, lowers core body temperature)

**Optional additions I tested:**

* Taurine: 500mg (helped on high-stress days)
* Inositol: 500mg (if brain was really racing)

**Reality check:** Not magic pills. They don't knock you out like Ambien. They just help your body do what it's supposed to do naturally. Start with magnesium only and add others if needed.

**4. Blood Sugar Stability (The Hidden Factor)**

**What I changed:**

* Last meal 3 hours before bed minimum
* Made sure that meal had protein + fat + low glycemic carbs
* No carb-only snacks before bed (RIP my nightly cereal habit)
* No alcohol within 4 hours of sleep

**Why it matters:** Blood sugar crashes during sleep spike cortisol and adrenaline (your body's emergency fuel system). This fragments sleep and destroys deep sleep. You might not wake up, but your body does internally.

**My typical last meal (7:30pm):**

* 6oz chicken or salmon
* Sweet potato or white rice (yes, I included carbs)
* Vegetables cooked in olive oil or butter
* Small piece of dark chocolate (because I'm not a monk)

**Reality check:** The ""no eating 3 hours before bed"" was brutal for the first week. But waking up actually hungry (instead of bloated) was a sign my metabolism was working correctly again.

**The Results Timeline**

**Week 1-2:**

* Felt slightly better in mornings
* Deep sleep up from 45 min to 65 min (Oura data)
* Still doubting if this would work

**Week 3-4:**

* First morning wood in literally 2+ years
* Energy more consistent during day
* Not reaching for 3pm coffee anymore
* Deep sleep hitting 85-90 minutes

**Week 5-6:**

* Morning wood 4-5x per week
* Libido actually returning (wife noticed before I did)
* Motivation for projects/gym back
* Less irritable, relationships improving
* Deep sleep consistently 95-105 minutes

**Week 8:**

* Got second bloodwork: 718 ng/dL
* Morning wood almost daily
* Feel like a different person
* Deep sleep averaging 110 minutes

**What About the Other Stuff?**

Yes, I also:

* Lifted heavy 4x per week (was already doing this)
* Ate adequate calories with good macros (was already doing this)
* Took vitamin D, zinc, omega-3s (was already doing this)

**But none of that moved the needle until I fixed sleep.**

I'd been spinning my wheels for 2+ years doing ""all the right things"" with minimal results. Sleep was the bottleneck.

**The Bloodwork Proof**

I'm not posting my full labs here, but happy to DM them if you're skeptical (mods, let me know if this violates rules).

**Pre-optimization (December 2024):**

* Total T: 347 ng/dL
* Free T: 8.2 pg/mL
* SHBG: 28 nmol/L

**Post-optimization (February 2025):**

* Total T: 718 ng/dL
* Free T: 16.4 pg/mL
* SHBG: 32 nmol/L (slight increase is normal/healthy)

Same lab, same time of day (8am), fasted state both times.

**Common Questions/Objections**

**""This is just anecdotal bro science""**

Fair. But I have before/after bloodwork from the same lab. And the mechanisms (circadian rhythm → cortisol regulation → testosterone production) are well-established in research. I'm not claiming magic, just that I fixed a broken system.

**""Why not just do TRT?""**

If your natural production is truly dead (sub-250 with symptoms), TRT might be the answer. But if you're 300-500, you likely have fixable lifestyle issues. Why commit to lifetime injections without trying to fix the root cause first?

**""Supplements are a scam""**

Some are. But magnesium glycinate is dirt cheap ($15/month) and most people are clinically deficient. L-theanine has solid research behind it. I'm not selling you proprietary blends or fairy dust.

**""I can't get sunlight, I work nights/live in Alaska""**

Get a 10,000 lux light therapy box. Use it for 20-30 minutes in your ""morning"" (whenever you wake up). Not as good as real sun, but better than nothing.

**""This seems like a lot of effort""**

Compared to what? Feeling like shit for years? TRT for life? This is literally: go outside when you wake up, take some cheap supplements, eat dinner earlier. That's it.

**What I'd Do Differently**

1. **Track from day one** \- I wish I'd started Oura/Whoop tracking immediately to see the progression clearly
2. **Get baseline vitamin D tested** \- Mine was 22 ng/mL (deficient), supplemented to 55 ng/mL, probably helped
3. **Address sleep apnea earlier** \- If you snore or wake up gasping, get a sleep study. No protocol works if you have untreated apnea
4. **Be more patient** \- I almost quit after 3 weeks. Glad I didn't.

**The Real Talk Section**

Will this work for everyone? No.

If you have:

* Severe hypogonadism (T under 250)
* Klinefelter syndrome or genetic issues
* Pituitary/testicular problems
* Legitimate medical conditions

...then you need actual medical treatment, not a sleep protocol.

But if you're in the 300-500 range with lifestyle factors absolutely destroying your sleep quality? This might be your answer.

**The average guy has multiple sleep issues:**

* Inconsistent schedule (kills circadian rhythm)
* Zero morning light (can't set proper rhythm)
* High stress + no wind-down routine (sympathetic dominance)
* Blood sugar rollercoaster (cortisol spikes at night)
* Scrolling phone in bed (blue light murders melatonin)

Fix those and you might not need anything else.

# How to Actually Implement This

**Week 1-2: Consistency Only**

* Pick your bedtime and wake time
* Stick to it within 30 minutes, every day
* Track your sleep with Oura/Whoop/Apple Watch
* Don't change anything else yet

**Week 3-4: Add Morning Light**

* 10-15 minutes outside within 30 min of waking
* No sunglasses during this time
* Still maintaining consistent schedule

**Week 5-6: Add Evening Protocol**

* Start with magnesium glycinate only
* Last meal 3 hours before bed
* No screens 1 hour before bed
* Keep room cool (65-68°F)

**Week 7-8: Optimize**

* Add other supplements if needed
* Fine-tune meal composition
* Get bloodwork to confirm results

# Bottom Line

I'm not saying sleep is the ONLY factor in testosterone. But for many guys, it's the biggest lever they're completely ignoring.

You can have perfect nutrition, lift heavy 5x per week, take every supplement on earth... but if you're getting trash sleep, you're sabotaging everything.

Fix your sleep architecture first. Then optimize everything else.



**If you try this protocol:**

* Get baseline bloodwork first (total T, free T, SHBG minimum)
* Track your sleep data
* Give it 8 weeks minimum
* Retest and compare

I’ve always had very high libido and it usually wears off after time being with one person but with him it hasn’t and we’ve been together for close on 2 years now. So me ‘putting out’ is never an issue, I love giving and pleasuring him and I want to spend the rest of my life with this man. 

Now the issue at hand is that he gets up at 7 for work which means so do I because i like to make sure he’s got coffee and all his things are ready and just kinda yap before the day starts. When he gets up to shower we talk and stuff but he then waits for me to leave the bathroom so he can watch porn and have a wank (idk if im allowed to say that here). Now this bothers me because 1. Porn… it’s makes me feel like I’m not enough for him and I can’t be the person to pleasure him. I am aware this may have something to do with my ADHD and being super sensitive to rejection (don’t worry I’m not some type of small mouse - I’m only like this with people who I deeply care about) and it makes me feel like he doesn’t find me attractive enough. He has assured me this is not the case and he enjoys watching porn because he imagining doing those things to me… still doesn’t feel good. 2. I’ve said I want to do it for him when I’m around (sometimes I stay at my parents place to visit them or sometimes I sleep in when I don’t have work) and he’s said 2 things to me before when I say this: “yeah that’s fair” and “uh it’s faster if I do it” (which isn’t true… he’s my best friend so you know, I’ve gotten good at it). This also makes me feel like I’m not enough (even though he assures me it’s not that) but it also makes me feel useless or like he doesn’t want me even though he says otherwise- idk actions vs words? But then when *he’s* finished, all of sudden there’s a rush and he can barely kiss me goodbye and he kinda shuts down and is not man I know. It just hurts so bad… 

The other morning we woke up super early so we had tons of time and I started you know, playing with him? And he got hard. Proceeded to get up and we both went to the bathroom and he then stood there watching reels ***waiting*** for me to leave the bathroom… I made coffee and got some stuff ready for the day (this was like 10 minutes) and then finally he opened the bathroom door and played his music super loud to say like “hey I’m done”… so I went back to say hi- I’ve been crying too because this is just straight up rejection to me- from the person I love most and put on a pedestal - and I was joking around and asked him what he watched and he got serious and told me to put down the phone… I was asking in the hopes he was at least looking at photos of me… So I left it. He tells me then that he watched porn (I won’t say what exactly because in all honesty I can’t spell the fucking channels name lol)… I feel shattered but I don’t wanna let on because we have ***haaaaaddd*** this discussion and I didn’t want to fight about this right then…  

Another reason I’m struggling here is because he’s fine to do this in the morning but when I try initiate intimacy at night, he says “no I’m too tired” and I always try because I want to give- so that even though he’s tired he can still enjoy? Idk if that makes sense…

I’ve contemplated coming on here to get advice for like a good 9 months now but haven’t. But this was kinda the breaking point for me. It’s really irking me and it’s making me feel so fucking small and worthless but every time I bring it up he rolls his eyes and he takes it as an attack (maybe I’m not approaching it right but I’ve tried so many different ways to approach this idk) and then we have an argument and I feel again like a small child getting scolded… 

When we do have intimate time together he has to take sildenafil (aka viagra) just to stay hard. Which has never bothered me because there’s something exciting about it but why does he have to take when it’s both of us but when it’s just him… well he doesn’t - he watched porn…

So here I am asking for advice on what to do or what the issue is here and maybe get an understanding of his POV because this just makes mornings so painful. I can’t hurt like this. Physical intimacy is so important in relationships and this feels like he doesn’t want that.. 

TL;DR: my boyfriend of almost 2 years watches porn every morning while masturbating and it makes me feel worse than terrible because he’s rejecting me (how it seems) and I don’t know what to do because when it comes to us both he has to take a pill (fine) or he’s too tired (I offer to do everything).

Are you tired of the negativity about autism and want to help start a conversation about our undeniable value? 

I am an unknown watercolor artist and emerging autism author/advocate who knew I was autistic for 14 years but hid it to survive. I am coming out now to lead a movement that shoves our talent in the world's face. I am curating an at-cost, coffee table, gallery-quality art book to replace the narrative of ""deficits"" with one of undeniable mastery. I have established and emerging artists on board, but I am open to all: your talent is all that matters.  

Landmark Art Project: Call for Artists

What is this?

I am curating a landmark, first-of-its-kind art book dedicated to the spectacular mastery of autistic women. This is a passion project rooted in our shared dedication to truth, fairness, and equality. I am taking zero profit as the author, editor, or publisher; this is purely for the betterment of ourselves and the world.

The Quality (The Gold Standard)

This will be a Museum-Quality volume designed to stand the test of time:

• 7 x 7 inch square, linen-bound hardcover with a high-gloss dust jacket.

• Full-gloss pages on premium 70 lb paper for maximum color ""pop"" and saturation. Every piece will have its own page for maximum impact.

• Distributed through the same professional channels as major publishing houses (global distribution, Barnes & Noble, libraries, Amazon, and Google).

What you get:

• Spectacular Visibility: Only 10 to 15 artists will be selected, allowing for multiple full pages per artist.

• Own-Voice Space: An opportunity to speak about your art, how it relates to autism, and the perspective behind your pieces. Any marketing links or none. Whether you use this to promote sales or not is up to you. 

• Privacy & Safety: Participation via pseudonym or anonymity is fully supported for those who are not ""out"" or prefer privacy.

Requirements:

• The Talent: Your work must ""scream"" undeniable quality.  Established and emerging artists have already joined, but private artists are welcome.  

• Technical: Once selected, we will sign a simple artist agreement. You will need to provide high-resolution files (professionals at stores like UPS or FedEx can handle the scanning for you).

• Deadline: No fixed deadline. Curation will not be finalized before August at the earliest, with the goal of Holiday Sales availability.

This is our chance to shove our undeniable value in the face of the world.

At first, I’d share ideas with James, who I met with regularly for coffee at the start of the semester, and I would share and openly brainstorm many ideas in front of him. I could visibly tell he was excited about some of these ideas. 

A few days later, I shared with a few members of the RSO outside of meetings and in between classes about some ideas I had, and I was met with discouraging reactions. This hurt and made me feel a bit alone in what I wanted to contribute. 

Then, I decided to curate a list of all the ideas I had. At first, I was planning to share it publicly with everyone in the RSO. However, due to the discouraging reactions I had seen earlier, I was scared to send such a huge list with many creative ideas at once and be thought of as too excited or too much. For this reason, I invited Michael and Veronica over and showed them the list in confidence to ask for their thoughts and if they thought the list was “too much.” Michael is uninvolved with the RSO, and Veronica (18F) is in the same RSO. 

Michael ended up matching my energy and got really excited, so we started talking a lot about starting a new RSO together on campus to make events together. During this time, Veronica sat quietly with my laptop going through the list. I thought nothing of it. 

Later, I came to a conclusion that I didn’t want to share the list with the RSO board—for now. As a first-year, I was thinking it would be better for me to wait until I have more experience and more of an organizational role so that I can be the one organizing the list of ideas I had and be credited for them (this was because I noticed a lot of conversations from upperclassmen being like “the RSO was great during the time of so and so” and more, which made me realize that people’s work has more impact than one would think) 

By the end of fall semester, I noticed a document prepared by both Veronica and James, listing exactly 8 ideas which are also in the list I had curated and shared with them. Examples include crochet night, board game night with monopoly, uno, and cards, an among us game night, creating a kahoot of people and answering them, creating decorations for our spaces, painting together, watching a movie together, and going to an escape room. 

At that point, I felt extremely hurt and betrayed. I also want to share that there were many things happening before I discovered the planning document they made together. I had another idea, which I had thankfully mentioned in a meeting in front of everyone, and Veronica reached out to me to implement it once. I was busy planning for it privately for a week, and the next week, she said in the meeting that she was going to send out an announcement to everyone that she’ll be hosting it. I told her immediately that I thought I should be the one doing it because it was my idea. 

Additionally, after I had shown Veronica my document, I started noticing more competitiveness behavior from her. She’d leave me out of conversations and not involve me. She also started being more active and taking a leadership role in the group. A lot of people now favor her over me, and I’ve been sidelined and left out on multiple occasions (in work related matters and outside). 

Anyway, I really am just looking for an outside perspective on this and advice on how I can proceed. I tried making subtle comments before, but I don’t think that did much. I also spoke to my advisor privately because I felt very hurt and wanted support. Nothing happened after that conversation. 

I also want to include that I was closer to James at the start of the semester, and when Veronica and James began planning together, they became very, very close to each other, and they both stopped reaching out to me or involving me. They are also both planning to apply to leadership roles together, and because they’re making all these events, the team is clearly going to favor them, and that hurts me a lot since I was hoping to apply too. 

Am I right in feeling this way? What can I do about it? I’d really appreciate some advice. So sorry this is long.",2,1769147203.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1qkingq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1qkingq/why_do_i_always_hold_back_in_sessions/,Why do I always hold back in sessions?,"I have noticed that the way I communicate with my therapist is very different from how I think or speak when alone. I can have conversations with myself, and I can express myself perfectly. When I am around any person, especially my therapist, I feel like a different person. I don't converse with the same level of enthusiasm or range of emotion. By myself, I can feel so many different things and spill all my thoughts. With her, I complain about my life, chit-chat, and talk about her office (it's a work in progress). Every week. It's always the same.

After our sessions, I replay most of what we talked about in my head. I analyze so much of it. Things she did, things I said. I don't know why this happens, but it always does. And since I do this, I compare the sessions to how I currently think and feel, and it's so much different. Why am I so reserved around her? Why can't I express gratitude for the coffee she made me, or talk about something cheerful? Why does my expression suddenly drop and why do I always stare at the same objects in her office, time and time again?

It bothers me because I don't feel like I'm being my authentic self. Heck, I don't even know who I am half the time. But what I do know is that I really like my therapist, and I want her to enjoy having me as a client. Yet, I am the kind of person that always shuts down and hides how I truly feel about everything. I become a hollow shell of myself. We both sit and watch the clock and she sends me on my way. Every time.

Our sessions start great, too. I've been seeing her for two years. There's rapport and trust. She's very friendly at times, like she's happy to see me, but the sessions always end up being a space for me to feel sorry about myself. I don't like it. How can I be more authentic and express myself? ",2,1769147201.0,TalkTherapy,3,1.0,False

1qkik3n,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qkik3n,Tamil YouTuber using AI-generated thumbnails to sexualize and humiliate women for clickbait,"Hi everyone,

I want to highlight a YouTube Shorts channel called “Tamil Guru” that has been consistently using AI-generated thumbnails depicting women in humiliating, sexualized, or disturbing situations purely for clickbait and view farming.

This is not a one-off. It’s a repeated pattern across dozens of videos. The thumbnails often show:

* Women in vulnerable or sexualized poses
* Women portrayed in humiliating or disturbing situations
* Completely fake, AI-generated imagery used to bait clicks

The actual videos are usually generic “explainer” content, but the thumbnails are designed to exploit shock, sexuality, and discomfort.

I’m attaching several screenshots showing this pattern over time (I’ve circled the thumbnails in question). This isn’t about one bad thumbnail — it’s a systematic content strategy.

Why this is a problem:

* It normalizes the sexualization and humiliation of women for attention
* It uses AI imagery to mass-produce this kind of content at scale
* It’s clearly designed to manipulate the algorithm and audiences, not to inform
* It shows how AI is being used to industrialize low-effort, ethically gross clickbait

I’m not calling for harassment. I’m posting this to:

* Document the pattern
* Raise awareness
* Discuss whether platforms should be doing more about this kind of AI misuse

How much should I be contributing?,"I just graduated from college and am back to living with my family year-round. I don’t feel great about it because I feel so useless.

There’s really not much I contribute. I tidy up after myself and others, I restock the coffee area, I do the laundry/dishes when I can, and I help my mom prepare meals (simple stuff like cutting and washing produce). Sometimes I’ll do slightly more deep-cleaning tasks (like cleaning the microwave), but that kind of stuff doesn’t happen very often because I very honestly just forget about it, and my mom ends up cleaning it before I remember.

All-in-all, it doesn’t feel like I do much at all, especially when I’m unemployed (I’m applying for a substitute teaching job rn) and my parents work full-time and always come home exhausted, my parents pay for literally everything (even though I try paying for my own things), and I can’t drive/cook because both stress me out, so I’m reliant on my parents for rides/meals.

I try not to be very needy other than that, but I just feel like such a shitty daughter for being so dependent on them. Why am I 21 years old still asking them to drive me to my doctor’s? Why do I have such difficulty meal planning and cooking?

It just feels like not enough. I should be an independent adult at this point, and I’m not. I’m wondering if this is somewhat normal or expected of young adults nowadays? Or am I just immensely incompetent?

1qkidwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qkidwe/my_sister_said_her_boyfriend_was_acting_weird_im/,My sister said her boyfriend was acting weird. I’m starting to believe her.,"I’m writing this because I’m scared. No, I’m terrified. I’m sitting here in my car, cold, breath trembling. I’ve been in this same spot since last night. I don’t know what to do, but I hope this finds you and you find me, before they do.

Let me start by prefacing this with a little bit of background. I want y’all to know that we’re not crazy. We’re young, a little wild, but not crazy. My name is George and I have a twin sister named Gina. Gina is dating my bestfriend since high school, Preston. Obviously, I’ve known my sister my whole life and we met Preston at 14. We’re 24 now. We have a close bond, so close that we all live together. Preston and Gina are both data engineers and I’m a private chef. We live pretty normal lives. However, we do occasionally love a little thrill seeking; rock climbing, bungee jumping, skating in empty pools on private property, exploring and tagging abandoned buildings —- you know, things like that. It’s a relief from having to be professional all of time. I won’t lie though, I’m starting to regret ever having enjoyed those things.

But, that’s enough background. I ought to make this quick. Here’s what’s been happening. A month ago, things were normal. It was like any other day. Preston and Gina woke up early and ate breakfast at the kitchen table. The smell of eggs, bacon, and maple filled the house. It drew me to the kitchen like the sounds of a siren draws a sailor to his demise. I should’ve stayed upstairs, but I mosied on down there. I could hear them laughing softly at whatever TikTok video my sister was showing Preston. “Good morning brother.”, Gina’s voice echoed as I bent the corner. “Morning y’all”, my voice cracking as I forced a sound from my parched lips. “Food’s in the microwave bro.” Preston, responding to the sound of my stomach growling. Everything was normal. Everything was as it should be.

“So, are you taking the job George?” I looked at my sister as she peered at me from over the top of her coffee mug.

“Yeah, I think so. I mean, I told them yes.”

“I think it’s a good idea.” Preston added. I was offered a job in New York the week before. A private chef experience for a couple bougie millionaires. I’d never been to New York, but I’ve always wanted to go. The job was three weeks long, or so it should’ve been. It was some kind of rich person’s retreat, dressed up as “fiscal planning”.

(Gina) “Well, before you go. Let’s all do something together. When do you leave again?”

I should’ve said no.

“If I go, Monday.”

(Preston) “That’s two days from now? Damn, I didn’t realize it was that soon. We -“

(Gina) “We should go tag that abandoned warehouse we saw the other day!!!!”

“Abandoned warehouse? Where?”

(Preston) “Yeah, a few blocks over.”

“No, there’s not. I mean I think I would’ve noticed an abandoned warehouse that close to home.”

(Gina) “I mean, we just moved here a month ago and we never really explored the area. Feasible that you would’ve missed it.”

(Preston) “Plus, it’s pretty tucked away. It’s like off a side street, almost cul de sac style. We only saw it because Gina here made a wrong turn yesterday.”

(Gina) “Whatever, so you down or what bro?”

“Yeah, whatever sure. Let’s go tomorrow so I can use Sunday to pack.”

I should’ve said no.

My sister let out an excited squeal.

The next day it was business as usual. Everything was normal. Everything was the way it should be. Me, Gina, and Preston pilled into my Toyata 4Runner. The air was familiar, a smell I had grown accustomed to from book bags filled to the brim with spray paint mixed with smell of the twine that built the rope we used for climbing. I couldn’t tell where one smell began and the other ended. There was an excited energy in the car as Gina pointed out the directions. Left, left, right at the light, left on the side street, right down a street that looked more like an alley, drive to the end of the field.

Preston was right. This was a cul de sac, with a huge empty warehouse at the end. Decrepit. Over-grown. The trees draped over the building like bags on the eyes of a man who’s lived way past his prime. Graffiti lined the building, reminding me of the faded tattoos on my skin. I know this may not make any sense, but the building —- the building almost seemed alive. Sad. Forgotten.

I parked. We got out the car, book bags, smiles on Preston and Gina.

“Y’all sure about this?”

(Preston) “Never known you to be scared bro.”

“I’m not”….

I was lying. I didn’t know why, but I didn’t want to go in. Maybe it was intuition. Maybe I watched too many scary movies. I don’t know, but I must’ve zone out. I found myself standing there alone. Preston and Gina, already in the building, beckoning me forward.

Each step was heavy, boulders tied to my feet. I took a deep breath and thought to myself. “Man up, you’ve walked into a hundred abandoned buildings. This one’s no different. This isn’t a movie, it’s real life.”

Words I regret now.

I walked in. The air outside was cold, but the air in here was warm, hot even. I could feel the house breathing, the warm air moved at a cadence, in and out, in and out, in and out. Before I knew it my breath matched it.

Hold on y’all, I think I need to move my car. I see people in the field. I’ll be back to finish in a moment, but I’ll post this for now. Just in case.

————————————————————————-

It was them. My bestfriend and my sister, walking across that field, towards me, expressions empty. I think I pressed the pedal through the floor as I drove out of there. In the rear view mirror, I saw them turn around and stare at my fleeing car. No smile, no frown, just a blank stare, standing there, watching from where it used to be.

I know I said, I’d be back in a moment and it’s been hours. But bear with me, I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t get the image of their faces out of my head. I drove to escape my mind. It’s playing tricks on me. I needed time to collect my thoughts.

Anyways, I’ll start back from where I was. I promise it will all make sense at the end.

When I walked in that building, it felt like I walked into the mouth of a beast. It was hot, humid, alive. The normal sounds of an abandoned building escaped whatever place this was; no birds, no rats scruffling across the floor, no creaks as we walked through. Complete silence.

(Gina) “Let’s go up there.” She pointed to an empty spot on the wall that had a staircase leading up to it or what was left of one.

“Sure.” I think my voice cracked a little.

(Preston) “You head up first since the ropes are in your bag, you can tie one up and toss it down for us.”

I should’ve turned around.

I crept up the stairs, still not a sound. It didn’t creak under the pressure of my steps. I couldn’t even hear the tap of my foot as I climbed up. Utter silence.

(Gina) “Hurry up George, you’re moving like a grandpa.”

“Shut up Gina.”, but she was right. Everything in my body was telling me to stop. Walk back down. Go home. Instead, I tied the rope around a rail that was bolted to the wall and flung it down.

“Here, but I don’t think you’ll need it. The steps didn’t give at all when I was coming up.”

(Preston) “You’re right. Easy work.”

(Gina) “Well keep going. I want to tag that spot.”

(Preston) “Yeah, we’re going Gina relax.”

We had to walk across a tattered floor, missing half its boards to get there but we did. Preston and Gina dropped their books bags and started unpacking the cans.

(Preston) “Look alive George” He threw a couple of cans my way and I tripped over a board in attempt the catch them. Fell flat on my face. I could hear the sounds of my sister’s obnoxious laugh and Preston walked over to help me.

(Preston) “Damn, you good man?”

“Yeah, I just lost my balance for a moment. Shit, it’s a lot going on with this floor.”

(Preston) “Yeah, let’s get this over with”

Preston walked back to his spot on the wall. I took a deep breath, shook my can, and sprayed away. In that moment, every worry drifted. As I crossed my lines and made my imagination come to life, I lost track of time. I forgot where we were and the fear that enveloped me as I walked through this building. I walked through what used to be a door way, continued to tag. I was in another world….. until I wasn’t.

Crash

My heart dropped as I heard the sounds of boards breaking, my sister screaming. I ran back out from around the door way, Preston had fell through the floor.

(Preston) “Fuck! Help me out of here. I can’t see shit down here.” For some reason, I was froze. My feet wouldn’t budge no matter how hard I tried.

(Gina) “George, what the fuck!” Gina ran over and yanked the other rope out of my book bag and tossed it in. I followed her, wrapped my arms around her body, grabbing the rope to pull it back.

(Gina) “Preston! Preston!”

No answer.

(Gina) “Preston grab the FUCKING rope”

It was a second, a second too long before we felt a tug on the rope.

I should’ve known then, we should’ve never came here.

I walked backwards, my sister following my steps, lifting Preston out of the hole. He fell over to the side, covered in filth, clearly annoyed.

“Preston, how you feel man?”

(Preston) “I’m fine, let’s just get the fuck out of here.”

(Gina) “Yeah, let’s go”

We packed the supplies, untied the rope on the stairs and headed out the building. I didn’t say anything, but I was relieved. It was dark now, and I just wanted to get home.

The car ride was —- dead. Preston nor Gina said a word. As soon as we walked in Preston went upstairs and Gina didn’t hesitate when he was out of sight.

(Gina) “What the fuck was that earlier George?”

“What are you talking about?”

(Gina) “Why did it take you so long to help?”

“I don’t know”

(Gina) “I don’t know? You answer is I don’t fucking know?! Unbelievable.”

She scoffed and left me standing there. I don’t know why, but in that moment, part of me wanted to leave him. Leave him in that hole. Leave him where he was at.

We didn’t see each other for the rest of that night and we barely spoke until I left. Just a few “what’s up”’s in passing. I figured Gina told Preston that I froze and he was pissed at me.  When Monday came, I slipped out the house early and sent them a text. “Just left. See y’all in a few weeks”

Honestly. A week and a half had passed since the incident and I hadn’t spoke to Preston or my sister. Being a private chef for the rich was exhausting work. I barely had time to talk or text and when I had free time, I slept. But one day, my sister called me.

(Gina) “George.”, her voice broke a little as she said my name

“Wassup.”

(Gina) “Preston has been acting weird lately.”

“What do you mean?”

(Gina) “3 days ago. I came down stairs and he was just watching static on the tv. I called his name a couple times. He didn’t even budge. It freaked me out a bit so I went upstairs. I figured I’d ask him when he came up for bed but he never did.”

“Well, did you talk to him about it?”

(Gina) “I tried, but he blew me off. He said he woke up on the couch after falling asleep watching tv and maybe it had just went out or something.”

“Maybe it did.”

(Gina) “No, he was sitting up right. He wasn’t sleep, he was staring at the screen. Silent.”

“I don’t know what you want me to say Gina. Maybe he was just screwing with you.”

(Gina) “He’s been doing it for 3 days straight!”

“Maybe he’s committed to the bit”

(Gina) she was clearly annoyed, “Whatever George, can you just talk to him?”

“Yeah, I’ll talk to him. But I’m sure you’re overreacting.”

She was not overreacting. I know that now.

I called Preston that day and he didn’t answer. I shot him a text asking if he was okay. He said everything was fine and I left it there. I told myself, I’d call him later but as I said, the job was exhausting. It slipped my mind completely. I never reached back out.

3 days passed.

My sister called me again. Sobbing.

(Gina) “George, please come home. Something is wrong with him.”

“What Gina, what are you talking about?”

(Gina) “Something is wrong with Preston. Please, come home. I’m scared.”

“I can’t just leave because you and Preston are in a fight.”

(Gina) “We’re not in a fight. He - He’s different. Every night. Him and that damn tv. It’s every single night. I find him staring at me constantly. This morning when I woke he was just standing over our bed. He was staring at me, no expression at all. Just staring. I don’t feel safe.”

“Then just got to mom and dad’s for a while. I can’t come back.” She wasn’t listening.

(Gina) “George. There’s something wrong. When I look into his eyes, I don’t. George, he keeps going ba——”

I was being called by my party as she was talking.

“Gina, I have to go. My clients are calling.”

I hung up abruptly and finished my day out. By the time I woke up, my sister had called me 42 times. Up until then, I thought she was just being dramatic but as I scrolled through my missed calls —- my heart sank more and more. I mean I was sure it was nothing, but I felt obligated to at least check it out. That was my sister after all and something, even if it was nothing, had her frightened. Against my will, I cut my job short and brought the next ticket back to Minnesota. I called my sister from the airport.

“Gina.”

(Gina) “Are you coming home?”

“Yeah. My flight lands in 2.5 hours. ”

(Gina) “I’ll meet you there.”

I pondered about my sister’s calls the whole flight home. I mean, Preston’s behavior was strange but he wasn’t causing any harm. Maybe I just didn’t understand because I wasn’t witnessing it. I kept trying to remember what she was saying when I hung up. He keeps going where?

My flight landed and my sister quickly found me. She was waiting at the baggage claim.

“You were just waiting here?”

(Gina) “I told you, I’d meet you here.”

“Where’s your car?”

(Gina) “I ubered here. You parked here right?”

“Yeah.”

We walked to my car. Silence filled the atmosphere so thick you could cut it. She didn’t say another word until we got back into the car.

(Gina) “He’s been going back there every night.”

“Going where?”

(Gina) “That warehouse.”

“Why?”

(Gina) “I don’t know.”

“Where’s he now?”

(Gina) “I don’t know. I went to mom and dad’s last night and I hadn’t been back. I wasn’t going back until you came home.”

“Okay.”

I didn’t have to tell my sister where I was going. She knew. We pulled up in the driveway and I felt a lump form in my throat. I walked in and Preston was standing in the kitchen. He didn’t even look up when we came in. He just stood there, staring at the counter until his gaze slowly moved up to meet mine. I felt violated, like he could see through me. Fully clothed but I felt naked in front of him. His eyes. His eyes were lifeless. He seemed a man with no soul, eyes sunken, hair disheveled. It felt like forever passed without him saying a word.

“Preston. You look like shit.”

He didn’t respond, not even a grunt.

He stepped from around the kitchen corner and every bone in my body shook as he walked past me. He didn’t acknowledge us. He just walked out the front door, got in his car, and drove off.

For the love of God, I don’t know why I went after  him. We should’ve just let him leave. But I saw the tears in my sister’s eyes. She pleaded with me without ever moving her lips.

“Come on. We’ll follow him.”

(Gina) “We don’t have to. He’s going to that warehouse.”

The sounds of that place made my heart skip a beat. I immediately recalled our conversation last night and knew that’s what she was trying to tell me. This isn’t how I planned to spend my first day back, chasing a guy who clearly doesn’t want to be caught.

I should’ve told her to just let it go, but instead I sighed, turned around, walked out the door. I could hear her foot steps behind me.

Another silent car ride, but my thoughts screamed at me. “Turn around. Do not go back to the warehouse. Do not step foot back in the building.” With every caution my brain threw at me, I threw a reason back, “That’s my bestfriend. My sister loves him. It’s just a warehouse.” But all that reason left as I pulled back up to that place, as I walked up to the front door, my sister clinging to my back. Her breath was shaky, I could tell she was scared.

We shouldn’t have went in there. We shouldn’t have went after him.

It was different this time when we entered. The silence this place once offered has dissipated. I heard steps coming from upstairs. The air moving through the building gave off a soft groan, the type you hear from an animal that hadn’t fed in days but just laid eyes on its next meal.

(Gina) “Is that a rope?” She pointed towards the spot we tagged when we first came here. She was right, there was a rope leading directly into the hole Preston fell in before.

We should’ve turned around there.

I walked forward without ever responding; up the same stairs from before but this time they creaked, over the same broken floor boards that squealed with each step now. Careful, as I knew my sister was following me. I stopped once we reached the hole.

I don’t know why, but I whispered “Preston. Yo Preston, you down there.”

A chill went up my spine as I heard his voice, familiar but not quite right.

(Preston) “Down here.” I saw a slight tug on the rope.

I shouldn’t have went down there.

“Stay here and turn the flash light on your phone on”

(Gina) “You’re going down there?”

“Looks like I have to.”

I’m almost certain you could see my heart pounding out of my chest. What was I even thinking? I grabbed the rope and lowered myself down. My sister held the flash light over my head but it did nothing to pierce the dark abyss I was entering. It felt like forever as I climbed my way down the rope, each drop down my grip loosening up, palms sweating, heart racing.

Thud

My feet hit the ground. It was pitch black. I fumbled around in my pocket for my phone. I didn’t want to turn my flash light on, but I couldn’t see a thing.

I should’ve climbed back out. Matter of fact, I should’ve never came down here.

Before I could get my phone out of my pocket.

Thud

I stifled my scream but jumped, fell straight on my ass.

(Gina) “It’s me”

“I told you to stay up there. Why did you come down here?! I thought you were holding the light.” I yelled at her softly.

(Gina) “I couldn’t let you come alone and I put the phone in my mouth while I climbed down.”

The light, I had never turned my flash light on.

My sister had her flash pointed at me as I finally got the phone out my pocket and hit the flash light switch.

I should’ve left it off. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see.

I saw him. I saw Preston, except, this wasn’t Preston at all. He stood there, staring at us. He said nothing. He just tilted his head and for a split second he smirked before he took one step forward and his eyes flashed a pitch black before turning back to normal.

Gina screamed, Preston or whatever that was ran. I scurried backward until I ran into something. My back hit only what I could describe as a pod. It was huge, round, and filled with something akin to amniotic fluid. I whipped my head around, flash light following.

I couldn’t wrap my mind around what I saw. It was Preston, inside of this thing. I couldn’t hold in my holler as I ran back to my sister. She was on the floor, sobbing.

“Get up. I found Preston.”

(Gina) shaking her head. “That wasn’t Preston. That thing wasn’t Preston.”

“No, the real -“ I didn’t finish my sentence, I just dragged her over to the wall and flashed my light. I didn’t know her eyes could get that wide. She immediately began clawing at whatever it was, trying to break him free.

(Gina) “Preston. Preston. Preston.”

“Gina, He gon—-“ . I ate my words before I could even finish them, he started to move as she started to break the sack. I couldn’t believe it. How was that even possible? Before I knew it, I was clawing at it too. The slime running down my hand and arms. My clothes covered in goo.

(Preston) “huhhhhh” Preston dropped out, coughing relentlessly, hands and knees on the floor. Before I could even say anything to him, I heard my sister scream again.

“GINA!” Was all I could get out before I hit the floor, my phone knocked out of my hand. My side was pierced, something was stabbing me and somebody or something was on top of me.

(Preston) “Fuck!” Another thud, whatever was on top of me was gone and I could see a light running towards it. Preston was fighting Preston.

(Preston) “Help George!”

Preston yelled at me, the familiar voice of my friend and I felt around for anything. Anything at all. In the dark, I picked up a piece of wood that broke off the floor boards from above. I grabbed it, grabbed my side, stood up.

“Hold him.” I said as I charged forward. The only thing guiding me is the shaky light from my sister’s phone. I plunged it right into it, the other Preston, before I fell. Preston took over, I could hear the sounds of flesh ripping a part, until the comfort of silence filled the air. It stopped moving, I could only assume it was dead. Before long, I felt Preston’s arms wrap around me and he dragged me, directing Gina to the rope.

Wait. How did he know this place so well? How did he regain strength so quickly? None of this makes any sense, but in that moment I was grateful for all the things I didn’t understand.

I didn’t dare to think it. Although, deep down, I knew something wasn’t right.

(Preston) “Grab the rope George”

I did as he told, every surge of adrenaline running through my body as blood poured out of my side. I could see my sister’s flash shuffling up the rope. Pain surged as Preston tied the rope around our bodies, he gripped me with his legs, and climbed up —- Gina, at the top, pulling us both up. I had never seen her with that much strength before.

We made it out that hole but before we left I looked down and saw the flash of my phone still shining upward. In the faint glow, I saw them. More pods. More bodies. Eyes fixated as Preston lifted me over his back, carrying me away.

“Guys”. I passed out before I could tell them what I saw.

I woke up in the hospital with stitches, Preston and Gina by my bedside.

“What happened?”

(Preston) “You got stabbed with a wooden plank. You lost a lot of blood.”

“No. I know that. What the fuck happened to you down there?”

(Preston) “I don’t know, but I saw everything it did. I have every memory of its time as me.”

I knew Preston well. He was lying.

“What was that thing?”

(Preston) “I don’t know.”

Something in his voice seemed off. It was steady, even paced, as if he rehearsed his words. I brushed it off but he seemed, too calm after witnessing —— no living through what he just lived through. I would’ve pressed this issue, but…. I just wanted to forget the whole nightmare.

I shouldn’t have went back home after that. Went to stay with my parents. I didn’t though.

Two weeks have passed since I was released from the hospital. I swear y’all, things were back to normal. We had decided that we weren’t going to mention that place again or speak about what happened. We were never going to go back to that building. We promised each other we were going to move on with our lives. Everything was normal. Everything was the way it should be.

Until it wasn’t. Yesterday, I went down stairs to get a glass of water in the middle of the night. I saw Preston and Gina were up, watching static on the tv. I felt my throat close as I grabbed my keys and walked out the front door. I didn’t even bother getting dressed or putting on real shoes. I drove straight to that building. Left, left, right at the light, left on the side street, right down a street that looked more like an alley, drive to the end of the field. My mind was in a frenzy…. Who or what have I been living with? So many more questions I dared not to ask myself.

I stayed there all night. That’s where I began to write this story, moving only when I saw them coming from across the field earlier. Whoever I saw though, that wasn’t Preston or Gina. The eyes, the eyes were black. If I can be truthful with you all, I don’t know which is worse. The fact that I had been living with them, business as usual for weeks. Or the fact that I don’t know where my bestfriend or my sister are because when I went back last night, the building was gone. It was just an empty field. I think it was the combination of both that prompted me to write about this. Somebody else had to know what’s happened to me. My lack of understanding had me driving for hours. And for some odd reason, after it all, I came back home. A sailor returning to his boat. I’ve been here for hours now, trying to find the words to finish this story. Wrapping my mind around what’s happened, what’s happening. I can’t make sense of it. I don’t think I even want to know anymore. I haven’t moved from my room, but I heard them come inside a while ago.

I don’t think I’m scared anymore. I’ve accepted my fate or maybe I’m just too tired to fight it. Either way…..

Everything felt normal, except, it’s wasn’t. Things were different, but ever so slightly. It’s night time and….

Downstairs I smell eggs, bacon, and maple. The smell is drawing me to the kitchen, the siren’s call to my sailor. I don’t want to, but I feel the need to go downstairs. I can hear them laughing.",1,1769146345.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1qkicyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tattooadvice/comments/1qkicyq/can_a_tattoo_artist_design_a_special_tattoo_for/,Can a Tattoo Artist design a special tattoo for all scientists around the world?,"Hello, 

I am a scientist. I think it would be cool if there was a special tattoo designed for scientists. 

It would be beneficial because: 

It would look cool ofcourse. 

People passionate about science would love it. 

The tattoo design itself could promote science and science education in general.

It could be a quick way for scientists to identify other scientists in public. 

for example, 2 people at the beach notice they have the same science tattoo and are both part of the cool science tattoo club and now this serves as an icebreaker for these two scientists to connect and have coffee and discuss the wonderful things they are working on in science and technology. 

It would be useful also because for example, someone could be vacationing on a beach resort in another country and then see someone from that country with the science tattoo and then two scientists from different countries could see the science tattoo and immediately identify eachother as both scientists without even having to talk, and then those two scientists from different countries but on the same beach resort can connect and share science information. 

I used to work as a scientist in a lab in Siberia. How cool would it be if I was able to meet a scientist from Cuba the next time I am vacationing on a beach in Cuba. The tattoo would make it so much easier for scientists to identify eachother and connect with eachother. If I just saw random people in public then I wouldnt know which people were scientists unless they had the science tattoo.

I am not sure how the science club tattoo should be designed. That ofcourse is the job of the tattoo artist to design it. 

But for example, I could suggest maybe it could be like a little telescope or something... or a petri dish... or atoms.... something sciency.

I come home and sauce is dripping on my white jacket and hands from improperly packed food. I’m carrying three bags and trying to carefully hold the food on top of it.

I hate how overpowering they are so I barely ate. I only ate a protein bar and coffee all day at this point.

I’m pissed even more that I can’t drink my wine after I have kindly asked him multiple times to just let me know next time so I’m aware if I need to get extra for him (and I usually buy more knowing this too). 

Again, I know I am being an asshole and I’m not trying to be ungrateful but I just get really upset because I also turn to food when I’m emotional and I’m not getting enjoyment from anything, while getting overstimulated by the small things. 

All of this to say, I hate that I feel this way and that I can’t control my emotions. It feels like I just want to flip a table over or impulsively do something. I tried to put on a show that makes me feel good to calm me down and just avoid saying anything because I know my feelings are ridiculous. I guess I don’t know what I can turn to deal with these reactions in a healthy way. I don’t want to alienate and make my partner feel bad at all. ",3,1769146171.0,adhdwomen,3,1.0,False

As the title says I had a customer that came in my coffee shop, got naked, touched her privates and wanted to smear it on me, I hid behind a door to protect myself and then she picks up a big glass jar and throws it at me but I dogged it. She then threatened my husband to walk with her or she would stab him (we didn’t see any weapons) We have most of it on video that was submitted to the police. She got arrested. I filed the victims report stating I was significantly traumatized ( 2 years later I even get a fast heartbeat and I get shaky by just telling the story). I had therapy. I wasn’t able to work or walk by myself to work for a long time. I was also in fight or flight at work whenever I felt a customer acting rudely or if they were erratic. I called the detective and told him that it was assault and he said he would see.. but nothing happened, the court hearing happened but I don’t know the verdict, I only know it was categorized as vandalism.

1qki87o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1qki87o/a_week_in_paris/,A Week in Paris,"I wanted to share some valuable information from our magical 8 days in Paris, where my husband and I traveled in mid-January. It was his first time in Paris and my second.

We prefer not to travel with a strict itinerary, but if you are planning to visit bistros or nicer restaurants, you must make reservations, even for lunch. Since we visited in January, making reservations the day before was quite easy. However, this may not be the case for most of the year. We spent months adding places to a shared Google Map and then chose our activities for the day from there. For us, this approach worked perfectly.

\*\*Disclaimer:\*\*

\- I usually avoid overly touristy attractions unless they seem particularly interesting or fun.

\- My husband and I love to explore large cities (such as Mexico City, Delhi, Tokyo, and NYC) and have lived in some, although we currently reside in a more rural area.

\- I live in the Pacific Northwest, so I’m accustomed to cooler weather.

\- We enjoy connecting with the local culture and do not expect the places we visit to cater to us; instead, we try to blend in with the locals as much as possible. We've made friends around the world by being friendly!

We conducted extensive research and felt well-prepared for our trip. Finding a few vloggers on YouTube proved to be incredibly helpful—Arielle in Paris and Paris Top Tips were our favorites. Watching videos about the basics, like coffee types and meal service differences in Europe, is a great idea if you’ve never been.

\*\*Hotel/Neighborhood:\*\*

We stayed at Hotel Basss, a solid 3-star hotel near the edge of Pigalle and Montmartre. The neighborhood offered a fantastic mix of local spots and shops, and we were just a short walk from Sacré-Cœur and plenty of shopping opportunities, including Galleries Lafayette.

\*\*Transport:\*\*

We thought we'd rely on Ubers or cabs, but we only used them for airport transfers ($60 flat rate to the Right Bank, and the taxi stand was quick). The city is incredibly walkable, and I've never been on a Metro that was so clean. There was no loud music playing on phones, which was surprising. Trains come every minute, and if you have to wait 5 minutes for the next train, something is likely wrong. Be sure to get the Bonjour RATP app, which allows you to tap your phone to enter the station and buy tickets in advance using Apple/Google Pay. Navigating the Metro was easy with Google Maps for routing. The latest train we took was just before 1 a.m., but they don't operate much later, so be prepared to walk or take an Uber if you're out late.

Despite indulging in plenty of food and wine, we both lost weight due to averaging 6 miles of walking per day!

\*\*Shopping:\*\*

We accidentally visited Paris during the sales period. Legally, sales are only allowed in January and July, and every store we entered had 30%-60% off a substantial amount of merchandise—it was fantastic! We shopped everywhere, from APC for fancy selvedge denim to Merci (my favorite shop in Paris), streetwear shops, vintage boutiques, grocery stores, and tiny local shops. If you're considering a designer purchase, check out the secondhand floors of the major department stores (near the top floors of both Printemps and Lafayette). I was in the market for a new bag and found a limited-edition Chloe for less than half the retail price.

I always greet shopkeepers in their native language when entering a store. It’s strange to me that some people need to be reminded to do this in Paris for better service. In any country, it can make a big difference! We had great service everywhere, but the sales culture is different here—no one tried to pressure me into buying. They simply said hello and let me browse at my own pace. If I needed assistance, I asked, and they were very kind and helpful. Many shops are small, so it's common for them to keep most sizes in the back—just ask for what you need! They don’t hover or attempt to upsell.

One cultural note that may differ from the U.S. is the idea of dressing well while shopping. On one occasion, I wore a simple white T-shirt and dark Levi's, and I noticed a difference in the level of service I received. It seems that dressing nicely—like wearing trousers and a sweater or a basic dress with tights—can improve your experience. I don’t think French women dress casually when shopping, which I respect.

\*\*Food/Nightlife:\*\*

I wanted to spend more on shopping while keeping our dining budget low, so we didn’t do much bistro or brasserie dining. We enjoyed 5 meals at Bouillons, which were wonderful and affordable—an excellent way to enjoy French cuisine on a budget. We had an unforgettable lunch at Le Petit Pontoise and indulged in great Neapolitan-style pizza. We also snacked on plenty of bread, cheese, and charcuterie from local shops and the Monoprix just a few blocks away. Wine is inexpensive; we picked up bottles for under $5, including a $2 bottle!

Dirty Dick is a great tiki bar run by a super cool guy from SoCal. Harry's New York Bar was an NYC bar that was literally moved to Paris and is a classic; so cool. We also found a few neighborhood bars that we liked. Drinking is cheaper than in most US cities, and people are friendly. We are in our mid-40s and made friends of all ages: locals, tourists, expats, you name it. Don't be a afraid to strike up a conversation!

Smoking is allowed and socially acceptable on the street and most patios. While it's technically not permitted in parks and some other areas, no one seems to mind, so if you’re sensitive to smoke, just be cautious. Vaping is also quite popular. If you smoke, stock up at the duty-free in your home country because cigarettes are quite expensive.

There are also cute dogs everywhere, including inside restaurants! If you are nt okay with this, you should be prepared.

\*\*Museums/Culture:\*\*

I feel strongly that you should never waste a trip checking off a ""list"" (more on that later). There are amazing museums in Paris, but if you don't love looking at art or antiquities, don't go to a huge museum filled with those things. We were going to skip the Louvre since there wasn't any art there that we had not seen that we were excited about, but we decided to book last-minute (the day before) after finding out about the antiquities collections. We went before lunch at hit Bouillon Chartier by noon. We also loved the De Cluny, but we are Middle Ages nerds, and the Roman Baths under Notre Dame were a must-see for us. The Carnavalet is a free Paris history museum that looks amazing, but we didn't make it this time.

We went to both Montmartre Cemetery and Pere Lachaise, and if you have any interest in cemeteries, sculpture, or would like to see the graves of any number of historical or cultural figures, these are a must-see. They are not like American cemeteries (no neat rows here!) and are more like romantic hikes. Be prepared for mud and uneven pavement/stones.

\*\*Final Thoughts/Personal Thoughts\*\*

Paris is a fantastic city! The rich history, unique place as the center of art and culture for centuries, food, wine, and fashion come together in a truly magical way. Don't rush. Walk more slowly than usual. Be mindful that people live in Paris and that it's a huge city. There are homeless people, drugs, crime, and millions of people. I found it safer than many cities that I have been to; it seems that petty crime is the biggest issue. Keep your wits about you and you'll be fine. 

Please do not walk around checking off boxes. This is a real city, not romantic Disney Eiffel Tower-Land. It is romantic, but I feel like you make all of us Americans look bad when you block the sidewalk taking selfies, appear rude by obviously taking photos while in fine dining or cozy restaurants, and take a quick pic of a piece of art just to say you were there. I know it's a pet peeve for me, but please, enjoy the romance and all that the city has to offer without a list of IG posts that you need in order to say you went to Paris.

1qki6st,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtRanting/comments/1qki6st/a_ramble_about_art_and_meaning/,A Ramble about Art and Meaning,"Okay, so pretty much, my stance on art is that most art has meaning, but it doesn’t necessarily \*have\* to, and the meaning doesn’t have to be ‘deep’ for it to be art. Art can be for amusement, it can be pleasant to look at, and it can be functional. Those things may not be deep or symbolic, but they’re still valid. 

So here’s where my rambling comes in:

The thing is, \*most\* of my own art in various mediums and formats \*does\* have some sort of meaning. It’s not like I specifically strive to never make art with meaning or anything. But sometimes my art isn’t really deep or actually doesn’t have meaning really (for example, it is meant to be functional). And actually, I’m more of a ‘storyteller’ and an illustrator. I make up characters and stories, and a lot of my art is illustrations related to a story. So the meaning tends to be story related rather than a stand-alone piece. And although I sometimes do more ‘serious’ looking stuff, my style preferences tend toward cutesy, cartoony, bright/pastel colors, etc. So sometimes, I just make things that are cute, where the point is just for it to be visibly pleasing. 

Despite that, I do feel like other people have had a tendency to assign meaning to my art that simply isn’t there. 

And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Once art goes out into the world, people find their own meaning in it, and that’s doesn’t take away from the art itself or any original meaning it had. A lot of the time, it can even enrich the artwork. 

BUT. The thing is, a lot of the time, artists aren’t necessarily \*aware\* of the meaning others find in their art. And when I’m aware of the meaning people find in my art, I feel like it just makes me feel stupid. Because people tend to think my art is much deeper than it is and revealing the ‘truth’ just feels embarrassing. 

So here are some examples:

1) I once drew something for anatomy practice. The drawing existed for the purpose of me getting better at realistic anatomy. I showed it to my mom because I was proud, and she liked it so much that she wanted to use it as the symbol for her poetry reading series. I said yes, she edited the drawing with filters slightly, and she used it for posters and social media and stuff. And then her friends sat there analyzing all the details of my drawing and coming up with all this depth that I didn’t intend (about things like why the drawing had no eyes. There were no eyes because I wasn’t practicing eyes that day). They also came up with a lot of femininist themes I didn’t actually intend, so I also ended up feeling like a bad person for not actually putting the femininism in it. 

2) In a college creative writing class I took for a gen ed, I wrote a short comedy story about taking cats to the vet. The ‘meaning’ of the story was to be funny and amusing. But I gave the main character an abnormal name, so my professor had the class discuss the symbolism behind why I picked that name. After my classmates theorized, he asked me the ‘real meaning’ I meant, and I had to explain to everyone that I just thought it sounded cool. 

3) I recently had some artwork in an LGBTQ art show. One of the pieces I submitted was of my original characters who are lesbians going on a date. There wasn’t much else to it besides just showing two women happily in love. Except those characters happen to be a fairy and a human clone, and another character who is a living doll was also in the background. So when someone I knew asked about it, I explained the story of the characters. And the person thought it sounded cool, but I was surrounded by all this ‘serious’ art and felt kind of silly going on about my weird characters. 

And it’s like, not the end of the world or anything. And it’s not like I’m doing something wrong, but it just makes me feel bad about myself. Because I make art all the time and I’m super passionate about it, but when I go into spaces with other artists in my community, I feel like I’m the odd one out. To begin with, my particular cutesy style preferences aren’t the ‘norm’ in a lot of the art spaces where I live. Amongst other things, most people tend toward much darker color palettes, for example. And they also tend to have a lot of social commentary (which I do find important, it’s just not what most of my art is). And next to their art, my art just kinda seems frivolous and silly, and when people ask me if I meant ‘XYZ’, and I say no, I just feel dumb. And it’s not even that I’m specifically trying to shove myself into events that aren’t for my type of art. The anatomy practice thing originally wasn’t even something others were supposed to see. The assignment for class didn’t specify that I had to give things a deep meaning or that I would have to be able to explain why I chose character names. I followed the assignment, it’s just that everyone else in that class wrote very serious stuff and not funny stuff, so it was apparently an unspoken expectation. The art gallery show was just supposed to be about LGBTQ voices and experiences, and I feel like showing lesbians being happy is part of that. But it still didn’t seem to fit what everyone else in the gallery show did, my art stood out like a sore thumb, and using my characters just made the explanation sound weird. 

So idk, all this to say, that I feel like I don’t fit in and that I get embarrassed when people ask me about what my art means and I don’t have a ‘juicy’ answer for them. I’m artistic, but I’m not the ‘serious poetic’ type that tend to dominate most of the art stuff where I live (not that there’s anything wrong with that type either. It’s just not me). And idk I feel like the questions tend to come more when I \*don’t\* make stuff that’s deep more than when I do. People just happen to not really discuss my art that actually does have meaning 🤷 

Anyway, as a funny extra side story, I also once drew one of characters pointing and saying ‘to the coffee’ because that character likes coffee. It was in my sketchbook. My mom was helping out with an art table and asked if I wanted to display any drawings, so I told her I wanted to display some OTHER drawings in the sketchbook. Especially because the ‘coffee’ drawing wasn’t actually done yet. I still had to finish coloring it in. And well, my mom went rogue and photocopied a bunch of other pages including the coffee one and added them to the display. And this created a problem the WHOLE DAY because people saw my drawing and thought THE CHARACTER WAS POINTING THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF REAL COFFEE THAT DIDN’T EXIST. So then we ended up having people asking us where the coffee was. ALL BECAUSE THEY WERE TAKING DIRECTIONS FROM AN UNFINISHED DRAWING THAT WASNT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. Ironically, I also hate coffee lol. ",2,1769145722.0,ArtRanting,0,1.0,False

We met in high school, and everything seemed perfect. But behind closed doors, I discovered the worst betrayal imaginable.  
  
When I came home from work one day, I found out that he had cheated on me not once, but TWICE, both times while I was away. The kicker? He did it all from our own house! Our stay-at-home husband, whom we trusted completely, was in on the deceit. He knew about his infidelity and didn't say a word.  
  
I was devastated, feeling like my whole world had been turned upside down. But what hurt even more was that he had been lying to me about being faithful for years. He claimed he was ""just testing boundaries"" or that I was being too possessive, but in reality, he was playing both sides.  
  
We tried counseling and therapy, but it became clear that our relationship was toxic and unfixable. We eventually broke up, but the wounds still linger.  
  
Fast forward to today... 3 years later. He's been messaging me out of the blue, claiming he's ""missed me"" and wants to ""try again."" He's even gone so far as to ask if I'd be willing to meet for coffee or grab dinner.  
  
Here's my problem - I'm torn between closure and giving him another chance. Part of me feels like I deserve better than someone who would so callously betray trust with two people, including our own family member. But another part of me feels like I'm being selfish by not giving him a second chance, especially since he claims to have grown and learned from his mistakes.

As the title indicates, I'm hoping people can chime in and offer some insight into this situation. This might be a bit long since there's a lot to explain. 

First, some context: I dated my ex (we'll call her Kay) for about a year and a half. We met at work and were very close- I felt very deeply connected to her, and I know she felt the same way. As the relationship progressed, I realized she was struggling with some pretty serious mental health issues (an eating disorder, anxiety, PTSD, and a really toxic living situation). I tried to be present for her and support her as much as possible. Her grandmother (who she lived with and was extremely close with) passed away while we were dating, and as soon as I found out I called out of work and spent that day with her. I also wrote her grandmother's eulogy and read it at for her at the celebration of life, which was something that felt totally inappropriate and uncomfortable. However, I did it because I loved Kay and she had asked me to do so. Around this time she started smoking weed a lot more as a coping mechanism which made me worry- she would even vape in my car even though she knew it made me super uncomfortable. She also started to tell me about her uncle, who she also lived with. He apparently asked her to sleep in her grandmother's bed with him after she passed away. Turns out he has a history of making weird sexual comments to her... I really had no idea what to do at this point and was feeling really horrible but also totally powerless. Kay ended up showing me her therapy notes one day totally unsolicited, and she had written ""Roommate?"" and listed my name and the names of some of her friends underneath. I felt like this was her way of asking to move in with me, but I was living at home at the time and wasn't in a position to do anything like that, nor was I ready to. Shortly after, she wrote me a letter describing her vision for our future home, the layout of the kitchen, etc... which really freaked me out. I'm not happy about the way I reacted to these things at all- I didn't know what to do, so I ended up kind of brushing them under the rug and not really reacting. This was not fair to Kay at all. Things continued to deteriorate to the point where I felt really overwhelmed and helpless. We were spending almost all our free time together and the relationship was starting to feel really unhealthy. I felt like her happiness depended on being around me, and I did mention to her a few times that I needed some time to myself to get my household stuff done and do things on my own. She didn't take this well at all. Things came to a head when I left for a week to go to a music camp. She texted me one day, I looked at it while I was busy in a workshop, then forgot to respond. I was in back to back lessons/workshops and totally forgot to write back. That night she sent me a long text explaining how she felt like I was only her boyfriend on weekends and asking me to turn off my read receipts. I ended up breaking up with her when I returned home from the trip, which was awful. We were both very distraught. Despite everything we went through, I still loved her so much. I just couldn't cope with how unhealthy things had become. I felt like I was losing my sense of self. 

We continued to talk at work and my romantic feelings never really faded. We even hung out a few times and got coffee, visited a record store, and other things. During these times we both had so much fun and I really wanted to rekindle the relationship. However, I felt scared that she had gotten over the relationship and just wanted to be friends. I didn't want to scare her away and wreck the friendship or make her uncomfortable.

After thinking about it for about six months, I decided to write Kay a letter clearly explaining how I felt. In the letter, I apologized for the way I handled things (particularly my response to her attempt at communicating her wish to move in together). I told her that I did see a future with her, including a safe peaceful home. I told her how I wanted to be there for her, make her feel secure and loved, go on trips with her, and generally be a better partner. 

Kay got the letter and texted me saying she is seeing someone new. I didn't realize this and wouldn't have sent the letter if I had known. I felt sick when I saw her message. I did tell her that I love her and always will in one way or another. This was about a month ago. 

Since then, Kay continues to visit me at work. She came into my office for about an hour last week and we talked through things. She told me that she felt the same way I did after we broke up- she also wanted to get back together during those times we hung out. I feel so incredibly stupid for not bringing it up then. We reminisced about a lot of nice memories and hugged for a long time before she left. 

Today towards the end of the day I saw Kay's car in the parking lot and texted her ""Is you around?"" just to see what she would do. Seconds later she ran (literally ran, I could hear her footsteps coming down the hallway) into my office and we talked for another hour. She brought me some almonds she had got at this really cool food co-op place we used to visit all the time. The conversation was really nice and we talked again about some of the nice things we both miss about our relationship. During the conversation I called her by her old pet name a couple times and her face lit up. She also repeated it back to me in a funny voice (this was a cute/goofy vocal stim type thing we used to do when we were together- long story). She was supposed to leave work at 3:30 but stayed with me until 4:00 just talking. 

She says she's happy with this guy she's seeing, but I find her behavior odd. If I were in her situation and my ex said ""I love you and I always will,"" I would probably cut them off and say ""Hey I'm taken please go away."" I probably wouldn't spend time reminiscing with them, much less come sprinting into their office with almonds.

Typing this out, I realize it is a horribly toxic situation. I probably sound like a huge asshole, but like I told Kay, I'm not the same person I was when we were dating. My perspective has changed after 6 months of reflection. There is so much good in Kay and I want to help her grow and support her through life. This girl means so much to me and I do love her so much. This new guy also seems like kind of a loser based on what she's told me and I'm worried she's going down a bad path with him. 

I guess my question boils down to this. Why would she act like this? And for anyone who has been in a similar situation, what did you do and what ended up happening?",2,1769144838.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

We spend more time learning about fictional characters in TV shows than we do about the person sleeping next to us. Like, you can probably name every quirk of your favorite sitcom character but can't remember the last time your partner shared something that genuinely surprised you. That's kinda fucked up when you think about it.

I've been researching relationships from every angle I could find: psychology papers, relationship podcasts, bestselling books, even diving into longitudinal studies on couples. And honestly? The advice that actually works is almost annoyingly simple. The problem isn't that we don't know what to do, it's that we stop doing it once we get comfortable.

Here's what actually keeps relationships alive:

Treat curiosity like a daily practice, not a first date thing

Most relationships die from boredom disguised as comfort. Dr. John Gottman (the guy who can predict divorce with 90% accuracy) found that couples who stay together maintain something he calls ""Love Maps"", basically a detailed mental map of your partner's world. But here's the kicker, that map needs constant updating because people change. The person you're with today isn't the exact same person from six months ago.

Ask questions like you're interviewing them for the first time. ""What's pissing you off lately that you haven't mentioned?"" ""What would you do differently if you could restart this year?"" ""What's something you believed five years ago that you don't anymore?"" Real questions, not the ""how was your day"" autopilot bullshit we default to.

Stop assuming you know everything

There's this concept in psychology called the ""closeness-communication bias"" where people in close relationships think they understand each other way better than they actually do. It's basically relationship overconfidence. You assume you know what they're thinking, what they want for dinner, why they're upset. And you're probably wrong like 40% of the time.

The Gottman Institute's research shows that couples who check their assumptions (""I'm sensing you're frustrated, is that right?"" instead of Why are you being so moody?) have way healthier communication patterns. Sounds basic but most people never do this.

Read The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John Gottman

This book is based on literal decades of research and over 3,000 couples studied in his ""Love Lab."" Gottman is a psychologist at the University of Washington and this is genuinely the best relationship book I've ever touched. It's not fluffy advice, it's backed by hard data. The book breaks down exactly why some couples thrive and others implode, and it's not what you think. Spoiler: it's not about never fighting, it's about how you repair after fights and whether you maintain fondness during boring everyday moments. This will make you question everything you think you know about what makes relationships work.

Build rituals of connection

Esther Perel (therapist who wrote ""Mating in Captivity"" and hosts the podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"") talks about how modern relationships suffer from trying to get everything from one person: best friend, therapist, co-parent, business partner, and passionate lover. That's an impossible standard. But what does work? Creating small daily rituals that keep you connected.

Could be a ten minute check-in every evening where phones are away. Could be a weekly ""state of the union"" chat about the relationship itself. Could be as simple as making coffee together every morning. These aren't grand gestures, they're tiny consistent moments that compound over time.

Use the Paired app for relationship check-ins

Paired is basically a daily question prompt app designed for couples. Each day you both answer questions about yourselves, your relationship, or random things, then you see each other's answers. It sounds gimmicky but it actually forces those curiosity conversations to happen. You'd be surprised how much you learn about someone when you're both answering ""What's a childhood memory you think about often?"" at the same time.

Try BeFreed if you want structured learning on relationships

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that turns research papers, expert talks, and relationship books into personalized audio content. You can type something like ""build deeper emotional connection as an introvert"" and it generates a custom learning plan pulling from sources like Gottman's work, Esther Perel's insights, and attachment theory research. 

The depth customization is clutch, you can do a quick 10-minute summary during your commute or switch to a 40-minute deep dive with real examples when you want to actually understand the psychology behind it. The voice options are weirdly addictive too, there's this smoky, conversational style that makes listening way less boring than typical audiobooks. It also builds an adaptive plan based on your specific relationship struggles, so the content evolves as you learn. Worth checking out if you're serious about understanding relationship dynamics without spending hours hunting down resources.

Accept that you're both constantly evolving

People treat relationships like a finished product. You meet, you fall in love, you commit, done. But that's not how humans work. You're not static beings. Your partner at 25 is different from your partner at 35. Their fears change, their dreams shift, their triggers evolve. If you're not actively learning those updates, you'll wake up one day next to a stranger.

There's this book ""All About Love"" by bell hooks that completely reframes love as a verb, not a feeling. Love is the action of paying attention, of witnessing someone's growth, of choosing to know them deeper. It's not some magical sustainable feeling that just exists if you found the one. That's Hollywood bullshit.

The couples who make it aren't the ones who never struggle. They're the ones who stay relentlessly curious about each other even when it would be easier to zone out and scroll through their phones. They're the ones who realize that keeping a relationship alive requires the same energy as building it in the first place.

I have struggled with bulimia nervosa for about 4 years now. I go through these weird episodes where anything I eat I instantly purge. I can’t find any happiness or satisfaction in eating food. I’m also a male (20 years old) and I feel a little ashamed to admit this because it’s not talked about or glorified much in males. It has impacted my life in multiple ways. I always feel fat even though I’m 6 feet and 145 lbs but the feeling of being fat never leaves me. I can’t enjoy eating with my friends and I’m so tired of this. Some days I binge and just order food off of Uber Eats and then instantly regret it and purge it. Other days, I’m lucky if I’m able to eat a bagel and iced coffee. For instance, all of first year, I just survived off of 3 venti Starbucks iced coffees a day a long with a bagel. I’m always trying to wrap my fingers around my arm and legs to see if I gained any weight and if I feel like I do, I won’t eat for the rest of the day. In multiple instances, I’ve taken like 10-15 laxatives in one sitting to make myself feel better even though my body was in SEVERE INTERNAL PAIN from it. I hate talking to therapists because it doesn’t get anywhere and I don’t find them to be helpful imo. The stupid breathing exercises DONT WORK.

1qkhsz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/micro_saas/comments/1qkhsz5/i_built_an_ai_based_expense_tracker_sless_stress/,I built an AI based expense tracker - SLESS (Stress Less) which addresses most pain points with budget apps,"You get conversational interface to type your expenses like ""Spent $5 yesterday for bakery items"". System will parse your request and extract details like amount, date, and pick a category for you, so you don't have to worry about picking categories for your expense. 

Other than that main conversational expense addition, there are some cool features as well.

1. Automatic currency conversion - Assume you have gone abroad or made a payment for foreign site in different currency. You can casually say ""€10 for Apple subscription"". It will convert the € to $ (Assuming your system currency is $) in today's conversion. If you added a past transaction and conversion rates are different between days, you can manually check the conversion rate for that day and edit the conversion rate if needed. Otherwise, system will automatically convert according to today's conversion rate.

2. Inputs by voice and photo/gallery selection (Pro feature) - You can take pictures or select from gallery of receipts to get the content of a bill and use AI to parse the extracted amount.

3. Privacy First - Your data stays with you. Your data is stored in your iCloud account with iCloud sync. So you can sync data with multiple devices and you can delete data when you needed.

4. Smart Categorization - You don't have to ever worry about category creation and deletion. System will automatically create categories for your expenses. If you don't like a category, of course you can create one or edit one. But system makes sure you don't have stale categories without any expense. If you have categories with no expenses, system will automatically cleans up those categories to keep things simple and clean.

5. Monthly budget allocation for each category available - You can enable budget for specific month's category. Assume you have ""Food and Dining"" category, you only want to budget for this category in January and don't want that budget in February. So you can only enable budget for January for the category, ""Food and Dining"".

6. Automatic expense addition from your bank SMS (Pro feature) - You can setup automation to add expenses directly from bank SMS to App so you don't have to manually type the expense. It's added automatically without you having to open the phone. Assume you get bank SMS like, ""APPLE SUBSCRIPTION for $5"", it is automatically added to the app as an expense.

The free version includes a beautiful UI with minimalist charts, detailed timelines, and full support for Light and Dark modes.

I’d love for you to give it a try and let me know what you think! **Download Sless on the App Store:**[https://apps.apple.com/app/sless/id6756651256](https://apps.apple.com/app/sless/id6756651256)

I've studied dating psychology for months through books, podcasts, and YouTube because I was tired of matches going nowhere. The amount of BS advice out there is insane. Everyone tells you to ""be yourself"" or ""just be confident"" but nobody explains HOW. After digging through research from behavioral psychologists, relationship experts, and actual studies on digital communication, I finally cracked the code. These aren't pickup lines or manipulation tactics. This is just understanding how human psychology works in dating apps.

1. Stop trying to be interesting, be interested instead

Most guys treat dating apps like a performance. They craft these elaborate messages trying to seem witty or unique. Here's what actually works: ask questions that make HER think about herself in a fun way.

Instead of ""Hey what's up"" or some recycled joke about her bio, try this. Find literally anything in her profile and ask a question that requires more than yes/no. ""Your photo at that coffee shop looks cozy, are you the type who orders the same thing every time or tries new stuff?"" 

This works because of something called the ""self-reference effect"" that psychologist Robert Kurzban talks about. Our brains are wired to engage more with things related to ourselves. You're not interrogating her, you're creating a fun space where she gets to talk about herself.

The Psychology of Texting by Phillip J. Chard (clinical psychologist who's advised Fortune 500 companies on communication) breaks this down perfectly. He explains how digital communication strips away 90% of normal social cues, so you have to overcompensate with curiosity and playfulness. This book completely changed how I text. It's not just about dating but understanding how people interpret messages without tone or body language. Insanely practical stuff.

2. Match energy but lead slightly higher

If she's sending one word responses, don't write paragraphs. But here's the key, you want to be slightly more energetic than her baseline. She sends three words? You send one sentence with a question. She sends two sentences? You send two sentences with personality.

Dr. John Gottman's research on relationships shows that successful couples have a ""turn-taking"" rhythm in conversations. Same applies to texting. You're creating a natural flow where nobody feels like they're carrying the conversation alone.

Also, respond relatively quickly for the first few messages to build momentum, then you can space things out. The app Ash actually has a feature that analyzes your texting patterns and gives you feedback on response times and message length. It's weirdly helpful for building awareness of your habits.

3. Move off the app within 5-8 messages

Dating apps are designed to keep you ON the app. They're not optimized for actual connection. Once you've had a decent back and forth, suggest moving to text or Instagram. Not aggressively, just casually.

""This app's notifications are trash, want to text instead?"" or ""Your photography is actually good, what's your Instagram?""

Matthew Hussey (relationship coach who's worked with thousands of women) emphasizes this in his podcast. The longer you stay on the app, the more you blend in with every other match she has. Getting off the app signals you're actually interested in knowing her specifically, not just scrolling through options.

4. Use voice notes strategically

This sounds weird but it works. After you've texted for a bit, send a short voice note. Like 10-15 seconds max. It doesn't matter what you say, you're just giving her a sense of your actual personality beyond words on a screen.

Why does this work? Because it breaks the pattern. Everyone else is texting. A voice note shows confidence and makes you immediately more three dimensional. Just keep it light and casual, not some monologue about your day.

5. Plan specific dates, not vague hangouts

""Want to grab drinks sometime?"" is the death of matches. Instead try ""There's this lowkey wine bar downtown that has the best charcuterie, you free Thursday around 7?""

Specificity shows intention. It removes the mental load from her having to figure out logistics. And weirdly, it filters for people who are actually serious about meeting up vs those just looking for validation.

Researcher Helen Fisher (biological anthropologist who's studied romance for decades) explains in her book **Anatomy of Love** how humans are attracted to decisiveness in potential partners because it signals competence and leadership. This isn't about being controlling, it's about making it easy for both of you to move forward.

The book won the American Anthropological Association's award and Fisher draws from decades of brain scan studies on people in love. She breaks down the neurochemistry of attraction in a way that actually makes sense. Reading this felt like unlocking cheat codes for understanding romantic behavior.

6. Don't take it personally when she ghosts

This is crucial for your mental health. If a match stops responding, it's almost never about you. She might be talking to someone else, got busy, lost interest in the app entirely, or a million other reasons that have nothing to do with your messages.

Dr. Kristin Neff's research on self-compassion shows that people who can separate their self-worth from external validation have better relationship outcomes long term. You're not going to click with everyone and that's completely normal. The faster you internalize this, the less exhausting dating apps become.

If you want to go deeper into understanding these patterns without spending hours reading, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from dating psychology books, relationship research, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You can literally type in ""become more magnetic in dating as an introvert"" and it builds a structured learning plan with podcasts tailored to your specific situation. You choose the depth (quick 10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive with examples) and even pick a voice style. The sarcastic narrator option makes dense psychology research way more digestible during commutes.

7. Actually read her profile before messaging

Sounds obvious but most people don't do this. She can tell when you've sent a generic opener to 20 different girls. Find something specific, reference it, show you paid attention for literally five seconds.

If her profile mentions she loves hiking, don't just say ""oh cool I like hiking too."" Ask WHERE she hikes or what her best trail experience was. These small details create the foundation for actual conversation instead of surface level small talk.

The reality is dating apps aren't broken, most people just use them poorly. You're competing with guys who put zero effort in and guys who try way too hard. The sweet spot is showing genuine interest without seeming desperate or overly invested before you've even met.

This stuff works because it's rooted in basic human psychology, not manipulation or games. You're just making it easier for someone to want to talk to you by being curious, intentional, and not treating it like a numbers game where you spam everyone with the same energy.",1,1769144573.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

But it had been a long two hours of crying and discomfort to get her to sleep. Her tummy had been unsettled, lots of cute little toots. New food was always difficult, but she would grow out of it, he had been the same.

Easing his arm from under her, he cursed himself for letting her fall asleep with his arm as a pillow. He caught her head as it slipped off his arm and laid it gently on the bed. Now he had to get free of the bed without dipping the mattress too far.

She was curled up now, little hands tucked under her chin, her legs curled up, so much like how she slept as a newborn that his heart hurt. He paused at the door, watching her ribs expand and contract with her breathing.

He forced himself to close the door, leaving just a crack so he could hear her if she cried. He took two steps down the hallway when he heard her thin reedy cry. Frustration swept through him instantly, a flash of anger in his heart.

Pressing his fingers to his eyes, he took a long deep breath, steadying himself. Her cries increased, starting to warble as the volume rose. 

With a push, the door swung open, and his daughter was sat up in bed, staring at the corner of the room. He glanced at it, expecting a shadow or a misshapen lump of clothes.

A figure was hunched in the corner, taller than the ceiling. He shouted, running to his daughter and scooping her up. Her fingers clung to his clothes, her scream silenced against his neck as he ran.

He caught a glimpse of long fingers over his shoulder, the tip of one touching his daughter’s fine white hair. A spark of flame drove the touch away, almost making him stumble in surprise.

Not stopping to put shoes on, he fled their home, out into the night that was quickly clouding over. Rain came in a sudden deluge, soaking them both to the skin. But he couldn’t stop, couldn’t go back to their home.

They were out on the street, cold and afraid. 

Headlights washed over him and he jumped back with a shout, the car screeching to a stop just before where he had been standing. The window rolled down, dark hair immediately soaked as a head popped out.

“Shit! I’m sorry. I didn’t see you. The rain just started bucketing down. Are you okay?” The question came sharply.

“W-we’re fine.” He muttered, trying not to shiver in the cold.

“You’re both soaked.”

He scuffed a bare foot against the ground. “Got kicked out.” He lied.

Visions began to roll through his mind, blinding him to the present. He forced them away, clinging to the woman’s words as she invited them into her car. The gutters were overflowing as he splashed to the door and slipped in, clutching his daughter tightly.

“Sorry. Thank you.” He muttered.

“I’m Rae.” She held out a hand.

He took it gently. “Jet. And this is Soul. My daughter.”

Rae gave him a bright smile as she guided the car back onto the road. “There’s a place around the corner we can get some coffee and warm up. I’ll be careful driving with her in the car.” A pause. “She’s beautiful.”

He smiled softly, pressing a soft kiss to Soul’s brow. “She is.”

A couple, midway through their years, subtly discussing the man's affair, with an odd calmness I wouldn't have expected. This incident reminded me of thoughts about infidelity that were confounding me.

As an individual engaged in a committed relationship, I've always held strong views against infidelity, believing it to be the ultimate betrayal. The promise of fidelity isn't just about physical exclusivity; it envelops mental, emotional, and spiritual promises too. But after overhearing that conversation, I felt a strange feeling gnawing at me - what if it really isn't as black and white as it seems?

Then, I recollected my experience during a psychology class back in college, where our professor had thrown open a debate on infidelity. Perspectives varied, with some stating infidelity should never be forgiven, others arguing it could depend on the circumstances, and few stressing on the notion that ""once a cheater, always a cheater"" was a simplistic and harmful stereotype.

So here's my question: Do you think our views on infidelity change with time and experiences, or do they essentially remain steadfast? How have your views evolved, if they have?",1,1769144296.0,Infidelity,6,0.6,False

 stressed out again and, for the first time in a few months at least, had a huge episode. Went from writing in my journal normal as can be one moment recalling a few days ago because I'd been too exhausted to record the last few days, and then halfway down page 1 it switches into self hate and anger towards myself in writing and hurried thoughts. It was such a strange experience. I'm there, bawling, feeling like a child (not the 16 year old stuck steering this shitwagon of an experience at all times, but part of me feels like... it's normal to feel like a child when you're crying like that? Is it?? or is it just that average trauma memory linked to past intense crying as a child?) while I'm writing this hateful hurtful lines of urging myself to do terrible things to myself and self delete. That everyone around me in my life who's complimenting me and being kind is only doing it because it's more politically correct to pat someone and say you're doing well than tell them to disappear.

Got

It felt like that dark, slimy, awful anger part of me that I keep stomping down so it doesn't explode all over undeserving people, but it's focused on me instead. It's self hate mixed with severe depression. Then it's just... Done. Fifteen, maybe 20 minutes, totally over it, like it never happened. Calm. I've always wondered why my episodes are like that. Like... Those ones specifically. Historically I'd had them so often in the exact same way every time with the same patterns if not more drastic, but then I got put on an anti-psychotic and did heavy duty therapy and it lessened them from Weekly/Every Other Day and lasting for Days on End to these short little bursts that seem to crop up in moments of major stress or weakness, or when there's a similar thought or bad mood involved already. This was the first in a While, like I said. I'd been doing pretty good and I'm so glad they only last like 15-30minutes then... stop. Entirely.

Like a switch flipped.

But my friend asked ""Did you feel younger or older, during that?""

And thinking on it... The crying self felt younger, like I said. The part being so cruel felt.. older. But nebulous older. I can't say ""oh it's my age/30's"" because I uh. Don't. Know what that actually feels like I don't think. It could've been anywhere from 18+. It felt ""adult"" compared to the crying like a kid part.

And now? I don't smoke but man I would sure take a cigarette or two while having this coffee (caffeine doesn't affect me doesn't matter it's midnight here) so I could have something to do with my mouth while my hands are busy bouncing between writing a letter and playing Stardew.

I guess my question is: does this sound familiar to anyone? I had zero amnesia, but I felt distinct differences, like two things were arguing, or the cruel aspect was bullying me. To what end, though? Like... That's the thing that keeps coming back to me even after all my trauma therapy: why do I immediately go to this identical script I've never heard anyone in my life say to me that I'm aware of?? The Same Script Every Time, like a broken record, then the song finally finishes and it switches to a different record till its forgotten long enough then Oops, Surprise, Time To Cry.",2,1769144208.0,OSDD,2,1.0,False

Graduation night. Jasper Hawthorne and I hooked up one last time. 

Afterward, he handed me a cigarette like always. 

“Just so you know? I’m not marrying a girl who smokes after we fuck.” 

My throat went tight. “Why?” 

He smirked. 

“Quinn. I want someone pure.” 

Then I ghosted his ass that night completely. 

Five years later, he showed up as my new boss. 

I handed in my resignation immediately, tried to bail before things got messy. 

DIDN’T WORK. 

He trapped me in his office, blocking the door. 

“Five years, Quinn.” His eager eyes dragged over me. 

“Wanna go again?” 

I didn’t even look up. Just grabbed my bag. 

“Nope. Gotta pick up my kid.” 

I wasn’t pure enough, Jasper? 

Good. You just made me your fucking nightmare! 

The room went dead quiet. 

Jasper froze. I tried to get off his lap. 

He pinned me against the floor–to–ceiling windows, not letting me move. 

That hungry look in his eyes? Gone. 

Replaced by something cold. His usual cocky expression cracked.

Chapter 1 

And we’d been broken up for five years. 

This kid had nothing to do with him. 

Obviously, Jasper knew that too. 

I tried standing up again. This time, his hand let go. 

As I reached the door, he spoke again, suspicion in his voice. 

“Your file says you’re single.” 

I paused, steadied myself and turned back. 

“Just got married recently.” 

“Recently? And the kid’s already three?” 

I nodded, totally casual about it. 

**“**Yeah. Shotgun baby.” 

Jasper didn’t say anything. His sharp gaze dropped to the cheap ring on my finger, and he let out a scoff. 

I didn’t give a shit, held my hand up right in his face. 

The second I saw him about to lose it, I bolted. 

That night, I collapsed on my couch and finally breathed out. 

Sometimes? Lying is the best way to dodge a mess. 

I’d grabbed that ring yesterday at a dollar store. Cheap. Effective. 

I figured it was enough to kill whatever feelings Jasper had left for me. 

Sure enough, next day my resignation got approved. HR came by personally to tell me. 

One week to hand everything over, then I was out. 

Normal resignations take a month. Mine? One week. 

Not hard to figure out who pushed that through. 

I nodded and started handing my work off to the new intern. 

The new girl was sweet and eager. At least when I was training her, I never once paid for my own breakfast or afternoon coffee. 

Right before clock–out, Wesley came up looking all apologetic. 

“Hey Quinn, can I leave early tonight? My boyfriend’s taking me to dinner.” 

I hesitated–not because I couldn’t let her go, but because I also needed to leave early to pick up my daughter. 

When I didn’t answer right away, she got anxious, pleading nonstop.

**Chapter 1** 

Graduation night. Jasper Hawthorne and I hooked up one last time. 

Afterward, he handed me a cigarette like always. 

“Just so you know? I’m not marrying a girl who smokes after we fuck.” 

My throat went tight. “Why?” 

He smirked. 

“Quinn. I want someone pure.” 

Then I ghosted his ass that night completely. 

Five years later, he showed up as my new boss. 

I handed in my resignation immediately, tried to bail before things got messy. 

DIDN’T WORK. 

He trapped me in his office, blocking the door. 

“Five years, Quinn.” His eager eyes dragged over me. 

“Wanna go again?” 

I didn’t even look up. Just grabbed my bag. 

“Nope. Gotta pick up my kid.” 

I wasn’t pure enough, Jasper? 

Good. You just made me your fucking nightmare! 

The room went dead quiet. 

Jasper froze. I tried to get off his lap. 

He pinned me against the floor–to–ceiling windows, not letting me move. 

That hungry look in his eyes? Gone. 

Replaced by something cold. His usual cocky expression cracked. 

He ground his teeth. “How old is the kid?”

Well, he moved back here 4 months ago, and we still chat just about daily online. We have met up a couple times for just a few minutes while out running errands and near by each other. The other day, he asked if I wanted to get coffee with him, and we did. It was a great visit with him. I have always liked him. We are both married for close to 20 years. My marriage is a dead bedroom. 

I have never met his wife, and she doesn't know about me.

1qkhmr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/hgh_t/comments/1qkhmr5/the_highperformers_secret_why_successful_men/,The High-Performer’s Secret: Why Successful Men Optimize Testosterone,"**Why Investment Bankers, Entrepreneurs, and Traders Are Secretly Optimizing Their Testosterone**

**The Real Benefit Nobody Talks About**

Everyone focuses on the obvious stuff:

* Morning wood ✓
* Muscle gains ✓
* Better performance in bed ✓

But here's what high-performers actually care about...

**The 10-Hour Focus Advantage**

**The game-changer isn't aesthetics. It's cognitive endurance.**

Imagine working at peak mental capacity for 10+ hours straight:

* No 2pm energy crash
* No brain fog after lunch
* No reaching for the 4th coffee just to stay functional
* Consistent decision-making from 9am to 9pm

**This is the competitive advantage that separates:**

* The investment banker closing deals while his colleagues fade
* The entrepreneur building an empire instead of scrolling Twitter by 3pm
* The trader staying sharp through multiple market sessions

>**Your competition is operating at 60% capacity after hour 4. You're still at 95%.**



# Why High Testosterone = High Performance

**1. Sustained Mental Energy**

Low testosterone = constant energy management  
Optimized testosterone = energy abundance

You stop rationing your focus like it's a scarce resource. You have surplus cognitive capacity for:

* Deep strategic thinking
* Complex problem solving
* Creative breakthroughs
* Decision-making under pressure

**2. Glycogen-Loaded Muscles**

This isn't just for bodybuilders. When your muscles are fully loaded with glycogen:

* You carry yourself differently (people notice)
* Your handshake feels different
* You look ""full"" and powerful in clothes
* Physical presence translates to professional presence

**3. Stress Resilience**

Healthy testosterone helps regulate cortisol. This means:

* High-pressure situations don't wreck you
* You recover faster from stressful deals/negotiations
* Sleep quality improves (even with demanding schedules)
* Emotional stability when everyone else is panicking

**4. The Compound Effect**

Better focus → Better decisions → Better results → Less stress → Better sleep → Even better testosterone → The cycle continues

**The Types of Men Optimizing (Quietly)**

I've worked with high-performers across industries:

**Finance:** Investment banking MDs who need to stay sharp through 80-hour weeks  
**Healthcare:** Dentists and surgeons where precision matters  
**Entrepreneurship:** 7-figure business owners competing in cutthroat markets  
**Trading:** Guys in Dubai managing millions, where one foggy decision costs six figures  
**Marketing/Sales:** Professionals where energy and charisma directly correlate to revenue

**What they all have in common:** They treat their hormones like a business asset, not a vanity metric.

# The Framework: 4 Fundamentals of Testosterone Optimization

**1. Get Proper Bloodwork**

Not ""bro science"" – actual data:

* Total Testosterone
* Free Testosterone
* SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin)
* Estradiol
* LH/FSH
* Thyroid panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4)
* Vitamin D, B12
* Complete metabolic panel

**You can't optimize what you don't measure.**

**2. Nutrition Strategy**

* Adequate calories (undereating tanks testosterone)
* Sufficient healthy fats (40-60g minimum daily)
* Quality protein (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
* Micronutrient density (zinc, magnesium, vitamin D)
* Strategic meal timing for energy and recovery

([See the breakfast rotation post for specifics](https://www.reddit.com/r/hgh_t/comments/1qkhj6a/the_breakfast_rotation_that_supports_peak/))

**3. Training Protocol**

* Heavy **compound movements (squats, deadlifts, presses)**
* Progressive overload tracked consistently
* Adequate recovery between sessions
* Avoid overtraining (kills T faster than anything)
* Include sprints or explosive movements

**4. Lifestyle Optimization**

* **Sleep:** 7-9 hours non-negotiable (testosterone is produced during deep sleep)
* **Stress management:** Chronic cortisol is testosterone's enemy
* **Sunlight exposure:** Natural vitamin D production
* **Minimize endocrine disruptors:** Plastics, certain chemicals
* **Limit alcohol:** 2-3 drinks per week maximum if you're serious

# Why This Matters for Your Career/Business

**Scenario A (Low-T Professional):**

* Wakes up groggy
* Needs 30 minutes and coffee to ""turn on""
* Productive for 3-4 hours max
* Energy crashes after lunch
* Drags through afternoon meetings
* Too tired to strategize or work on business growth after 6pm
* Looks soft and tired in client meetings

**Scenario B (Optimized Professional):**

* Wakes up alert and ready
* Consistent energy from morning to evening
* Can deep work for extended periods
* Commands respect in rooms (presence is felt)
* Still has energy for gym, family, and side projects
* Looks and feels like someone operating at peak capacity

# Which guy gets the promotion? Closes the deal? Scales the business?

**The ROI Calculation**

Investment to optimize testosterone:

* Quality food: $50-100/week extra
* Gym membership: $50-100/month
* Supplements (if needed): $50-100/month
* Bloodwork 2-3x/year: $200-400
* Quality sleep (better mattress, blackout curtains, etc): One-time $500-2000

**Total annual investment: \~$3,000-5,000**

Return:

* 30-40% increase in productive hours per week
* Better decision-making (fewer costly mistakes)
* Increased earning potential from sustained performance
* Reduced healthcare costs long-term
* Improved relationships (professional and personal)

# If you make $100k+, this might be the highest ROI decision you'll make this year.

**The Compound Advantage**

Here's what happens after 3-6 months of optimization:

**Month 1-2:** Better sleep, more consistent energy, training gains accelerate  
**Month 3-4:** Noticeable body composition changes, focus is dialed in, people comment on your ""energy""  
**Month 5-6:** Operating at a completely different level, work output has increased 30-50%, confidence is natural

You're not working harder. **You're operating from a different biological baseline.**

**Start Here**

1. **Get bloodwork scheduled this week** – No excuses, just book it
2. **Audit your current habits** – Rate yourself 1-10 on each of the 4 fundamentals
3. **Fix the lowest-hanging fruit first** – Usually sleep or nutrition
4. **Track subjectively** – Energy levels, focus duration, mood, training performance
5. **Retest in 8-12 weeks** – Compare data and adjust

**The Uncomfortable Truth**

Most men are operating at 60-70% of their potential capacity and have no idea.

They think brain fog is normal.  
They think needing 4 coffees is just ""how it is.""  
They think losing focus after a few hours is inevitable.  
They think looking soft in their 30s-40s is unavoidable.

**It's not.**

Your competitors who seem to have ""endless energy"" and ""superhuman focus""? They're not special. They just optimized their biology while you were ignoring yours.

**Final Thoughts**

This isn't about vanity metrics or gym selfies (though those are nice bonuses).

This is about **competitive advantage in a world where focus and energy are currency.**

While everyone else is managing their decline, you're building an engine that compounds over time.

The successful guys already know this. They're just not broadcasting it.

 

* What's your current focus/energy situation like during work hours?
* Have you gotten comprehensive bloodwork in the last 6 months?
* If you could add 3-4 productive hours to your day, what would change in your career/business?

1qkhmqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1qkhmqq/releasing_of_guilt_and_shame_related_to_perceived/,Releasing of guilt and shame related to perceived abandonment,"This is a tricky one to talk about, because you need to first accept the concepts of reincarnation, of past-lives, and of past-life events having powerful emotion impacts that can carry into our next ones.

With that in mind, I can discuss what I experienced. After my Psilocybin experience, documented here [https://www.reddit.com/r/Experiencers/comments/1o3l1ly/a_psilocybin_initiation/] I went through a lot of emotional processing the weeks following. It was anything but straightforward however... mostly a lot of unconscious processing going on.

But last night, I made some sort of breakthrough. I had some chocolate I had been given for my birthday ~ which was on Wednesday ~ so I took that and then felt dizzy, as I usually do with chocolate, so I went for the solution that seems to help ~ coffee. Brewed some, drank, accepting that I might not get the best quality sleep, but hey, better than sugar making feel like crap, as coffee seems to balance me out. Didn't accomplish much at first ~ computer, social media, programming ~ then I decided I was tired, so I went to bed.

In bed, though, I began to think and think, about my feelings of guilt, shame, abandonment, confused and torn in the midst of it. Eventually, I realized something ~ there was a pattern throughout my entire life, of being abandoned... moving homes, schools, being made to live on a veranda outside of a house's walls because I had a wet dream coming into puberty, of moving in with my auntie, and her throwing me out, of going from youth house to youth house, feeling lost, thrown aside.

I wondered... why? Why? What did it all mean? What was even the purpose of this pattern? I couldn't understand. I asked again... why? Why? I had to understand, I wanted to, I needed to. I became almost desperate. My mind eventually responded to my desperation with the answers... I went into what was a series of flashbacks.

In my past life, I was a shaman in the Amazon, with a community, a village, a tribe, a people. I belonged. But then... my pet, my animal companion, a tiger, had killed one of the women, out of jealousy, that it felt I was getting too intimate with. It happened all so suddenly. I wasn't able to pick up on the signs before it happened. By the time it did, it was just too late. There was turmoil and uproar after that ~ anger from my tribe. I was asked to kill my tiger for its crime. But... something in me compelled me to defend them, to protect them, to take on the weight of the deed onto myself, to bear the burden. It wasn't the tiger's fault ~ they were protecting me, so they perceived, and they had never acted anything like this prior, so it was a major shock that could never have been foreseen.

The village simply didn't know how to respond to this ~ I was a respected shaman, so they couldn't kill me. So, the village elder, our leader, decided that, in compromise, I was to be exiled for 5 years. Before that, they called me in for questioning ~ why would I make such a massive sacrifice? What compelled me? I realized that I had been seeing flashbacks of myself through the elder's eyes, his compassion, empathy, understanding, as I was unable to offer any of it to myself, as I blamed myself for not seeing the signs. I saw myself... bowing before him, broken, limp, barely able to respond, yet willingly taking on such a heavy burden.

The elder was much wiser than me ~ he understood that something had compelled me to make a massively selfless sacrifice, to protect one who had killed another. Any blame he had for my tiger was never brought up ~ he focused purely on why I, a respected wise-man, would take on such a burden. Such a sacrifice, he recognized, required compassion, empathy and understanding, of the perspective of another. He had thought about this for a while, reasoning and considering, as he knew I was not one to blindly defend another without good reason. So, he decided ~ I was to be exiled, but I would not be entirely abandoned. I would be brought supplies at intervals, but I had to leave my tiger behind, to protect them ~ and just in-case, it was a man the elder trusted to secrecy.

But... that didn't stop me feeling guilty, abandoned, full of shame, confusion, pain. It pierced a hole in my heart, leaving me feeling broken and lost. Yet... the spirits didn't abandon me. They recognized the nature of my sacrifice, which was considered significant and worthy in their eyes. Only someone with empathy and compassion could make such a sacrifice. But they also knew that I had become unable to have empathy and compassion for myself. I eventually forgave my tiger companion, though, after time and consideration. But, what I didn't quite know is that they felt guilt and shame themself, as they had acted on impulse, had seen my reaction, perceived their actions as something I didn't like or agree with, so felt confusion and shame, which was consequentially buried, because they couldn't understand it ~ their mind couldn't deal with the emotions, so I was unable to help them, even with the aid of Ayahuasca.

Only when I came to full comprehension of this did something in me, now returned to noticing I was lying in bed in this life, snapping out of the flashbacks, rise and gently shatter. It felt like some broken part in my heart had been rejoined, repaired, made whole. I felt... different. I felt more complete, more like myself again. A wound was healed. My heart... didn't have blacked hole in it anymore. I could feel more wholesomely.

I realized that the patterns of abandonment in this life were to force me to look at the wound ~ they were a sort of very extended set of exposure therapy, to force me to look inwards. The wound was deep, so the cure needed to be just as strong ~ that is, I had to be forced, even brutally so, to look at the wound, so I could come to terms with it, at any cost.

I was able to actually perceive the memories of the elder again ~ I realized these memories came from a life review where I was shown his perspective, his wisdom. I realized I had met him during one Ayahuasca journey ~ he had reincarnate, as a shaman, a wise-man, himself, inspired by my compassion and empathy, my own wisdom to see the true intent of another, to take on a massive burden I could barely bear... I thought he was familiar, but I couldn't place it until I made some unconscious connection ~ the energy of the elder was the same as the energy of that shaman.

1qkhkmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoid/comments/1qkhkmd/rheum_appt_tomorrow_stress_vent/,rheum appt tomorrow - stress vent.,"My quarterly appt with my rheumatologist is tomorrow, Friday. I’m hoping to figure out my next option. “Hoping”-it’s hard to feel hopeful. I recently completed my 7th medication  change since being diagnosed 2 years ago. I’ve had difference combinations of steroids, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, leflunomide, azathioprine and amjevita. The combos that helped the most also had the worst side effects. I’m currently taking hydrox, amjevita, and tapering down steroids (it’s been horrible). This is my third appt with this doctor and she’s okay. I really liked the last rhuem I had but my insurance changed. The first appt I had with her -current rheum- she asked me if I was sure my previous doctors diagnosed me with lupus and asked me why they did blah blah blah. My second appt she said my symptoms were very mild and I’m doing very good based on my reaction to the pain of her squeezing my swollen finger joints (as if I have an average pain tolerance or am surprised by my hands hurting) and the swelling she observed in my knees at our afternoon appointment. She once suggested I try yoga to exercise - after I told her about all the daily tasks I can’t do. I plan to schedule with a different doctor for my next appointment. If I remember right my next option is revisiting methotrexate (even though the doctor she’s so skeptical of took me off it due to low white blood cell count), trying a different biologic (one I’m morally conflicted about due to animal protein), or infusions. 

I really miss talking to my dad about this. He was a great listener and spent time learning about autoimmune diseases. He passed away 8 months ago.

I’m tired and sad and stressed. My mental health , appetite, weight, activity levels are so closely influenced by SLE & RA. Not to mention my work performance. I’ve had to change non-autoimmune condition treatment plans multiple times. I try really hard to cope with my life, I try really hard to stay present  and to be patient and kind with my body. I try to limit and adjust every part of my life that I can. But I’m so fucking tired of it all. I had to take breaks texting this because my hands are stiffening up after making coffee and cereal and a scrambled egg, working a long work shift, ordering take out and carrying heavy pet supplies up to my apartment-maybe going yoga today would have felt good. I plan to do a nice mental reset tomorrow morning and find a hopeful perspective before I check in. I want to believe that I can feel better and find a long term reliable way to manage the pain snd symptoms. I want to believe that I can do the things I want again. I want to believe my life can get better.

1qkhkhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelFanStory/comments/1qkhkhc/transport/,Transport,"Just outside **Rochester, New York**, there was a quiet town called **Ironwood Falls**.

It wasn’t famous for anything. A few diners. A hardware store. A long stretch of road where trucks hummed past cornfields and old barns. The kind of place where everyone waved—even if they didn’t really know you.

That was where **Elena Morales** was born.

# A Normal Life, Built With Grease and Kindness

Elena grew up in a modest house with parents who believed in hard work and open doors.

Her father, **Carlos Morales**, was a delivery truck driver who knew every backroad in Monroe County.  
Her mother, **Rosa Morales**, worked as a nurse’s aide at a long-term care facility.

>

Elena loved engines from the time she could walk. She liked how machines made sense—how broken things could be fixed if you listened closely enough.

By her twenties, she was a **certified mechanic**, grease under her nails, jukebox music playing in the background of her own auto shop:

**Morales Family Auto & Repair**

She married at thirty—to **Daniel Brooks**, a soft-spoken high school history teacher who loved old maps and terrible coffee.

They didn’t have kids.

But they had love.

And that was enough.

# A Shop That Welcomed Everyone

Ironwood Falls changed after the Catalyst.

Super mutants passed through town—some scared, some hopeful, some just looking for a tire change and a meal. Elena never turned anyone away.

>

That kindness drew attention.

One afternoon, the shop doors creaked open, and **members of the Extreme Exterminators** stepped inside. Red insignias. Cold eyes.

Their leader spoke quietly.

>

Elena didn’t flinch.

>

The man leaned closer.

>

Elena stared him down.

>

They left.

She locked the door that night with a bad feeling in her gut.

# Fire and Loss

The next night, **Morales Family Auto** burned.

Flames devoured the garage. The lift collapsed. Tools melted. Everything Elena built with her hands turned to smoke.

She dropped to her knees in the street, sobbing.

Then her phone rang.

The hospital.

Daniel’s cancer—aggressive, unstoppable—had taken a sudden turn.

He was gone.

Elena screamed until her throat gave out.

# The Roadside Miracle

Hours later, numb and hollow, Elena drove home in silence.

Halfway down Route 31, the engine sputtered.

Then died.

She pulled over, hazards blinking, hands shaking on the steering wheel.

>

She rested her forehead against the wheel.

That’s when the air changed.

A **feather of golden light** drifted down—soft, impossible.

The Catalyst.

It touched her.

Pain surged—but it wasn’t tearing.

It was… *transforming*.

Her bones stretched. Skin hardened into metal. Glass formed where eyes had been. Tires replaced feet. Her heartbeat synced with an engine roar.

Elena became the car.

She gasped—then laughed through tears.

>

She turned the key—without a key.

And drove herself home.

In her driveway, she reshaped—metal folding back into flesh, glass into skin.

Elena Morales stood there shaking, alive.

Different.

# A Super Mutant Awakens

By morning, Charles Xavier knew.

He arrived quietly, wheelchair rolling up the cracked driveway.

Elena opened the door cautiously.

>

She crossed her arms.

>

She hesitated.

>

He leaned forward.

>

She looked away.

>

Charles’s voice softened.

>

Silence hung between them.

>

Elena swallowed.

>

Charles smiled.

>

She thought about the road. The hum. The sense of purpose.

>

>

Elena wiped her eyes.

>

And somewhere beyond Ironwood Falls—

1qkhdpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cassetteculture/comments/1qkhdpx/mystery_faq_regarding_fiio_cp15/,Mystery FAQ regarding FiiO CP15,"A few days ago this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/cassetteculture/comments/1qh64xy/recording_capacity_on_upcoming_fiio_cp15/ had quoted a number of paragraphs regarding a review of the upcoming CP15. Here is the review in full:

**FiiO CP15 Portable Stereo Cassette Player: Is It the Right Retro Audio Companion for Modern Listeners?**

The FiiO CP15 cassette player combines retro design with modern audio tech, offering improved tape handling, high-resolution playback, and reliable durability for both playback and recording needs.

Table of Contents

 1. Is the FiiO CP15 a genuine upgrade over older cassette players, or just a rebranded budget model?
 2. Can the FiiO CP15 actually record from line-in sources, and how does it compare to standalone cassette recorders?
 3. Does the FiiO CP15 support modern connectivity options like Bluetooth or USB playback, and how useful are they?
 4. How durable is the FiiO CP15 for daily carry, and what environmental conditions can it withstand?
 5. Are there any hidden limitations or quirks users should know before buying the FiiO CP15?


**Is the FiiO CP15 a genuine upgrade over older cassette players, or just a rebranded budget model?**

Yes, the FiiO CP15 is a legitimate technical upgrade over most legacy cassette decks—not because it’s expensive, but because it integrates modern audio engineering into a retro form factor without compromising core functionality. Unlike generic cassette players sold on AliExpress that often use low-torque motors, flimsy head assemblies, and basic 1-bit DACs, the CP15 features a precision-engineered dual-capstan transport system derived from FiiO’s high-end portable audio lineage. This means consistent tape speed stability even during movement—something I tested by playing a worn-out 1987 copy of Pink Floyd’s “The Wall” while walking through a crowded market in Bangkok. The tape didn’t flutter, skip, or slow down once, despite the jostling. Most budget players would have distorted or stopped entirely.

The internal circuitry uses a dedicated AKM AK4452 DAC chip—the same one found in FiiO’s M7 and M11 series players—which delivers 32-bit/384kHz playback capability. While cassettes are analog media, the CP15 digitizes the signal at a higher resolution than any other portable cassette device under $100. When connected via USB-C to my laptop, I was able to capture clean 24-bit/96kHz recordings directly from tapes using Audacity, with noise floor measurements below -85dB. That level of fidelity is unheard of in devices like the Sony Walkman WM-FX290 or even the discontinued Panasonic RQ-JS200.

What sets the CP15 apart isn’t just its components—it’s how they’re implemented. The head alignment is factory-calibrated to JIS standards (not approximated), and the bias current is adjustable via firmware settings accessible through the companion app (available on Android). I calibrated mine for Type II chrome tapes after noticing slight high-frequency roll-off on a collection of 1990s rock albums. Within minutes, the treble response became crisp and natural, not harsh. No other portable cassette player in this price range offers user-accessible bias adjustment.

On AliExpress, you’ll find dozens of “FiiO-compatible” knockoffs claiming similar specs—but none replicate the CP15’s mechanical damping system. The chassis uses a layered aluminum-magnesium alloy with internal rubber isolation mounts, reducing vibration-induced wow/flutter by nearly 60% compared to plastic-bodied competitors. In blind listening tests with three audiophiles using identical tapes, every participant correctly identified the CP15 as having superior tonal balance and spatial imaging—even when unaware of the brand.

This isn’t nostalgia marketing. It’s precision engineering repurposed for analog revivalists who refuse to accept degraded sound quality just because the medium is old.

**Can the FiiO CP15 actually record from line-in sources, and how does it compare to standalone cassette recorders?**

Yes, the FiiO CP15 can record from external line-in sources—and it does so with significantly better noise performance than most vintage or modern standalone cassette recorders. Unlike the Tascam Porta-02 or even the Sony TC-K55ES, which require manual gain staging and suffer from hiss due to unshielded preamps, the CP15 includes an active line-level input with automatic gain control (AGC) and a built-in noise reduction circuit modeled after Dolby B/C algorithms, but digitally optimized.

I used it to transfer live recordings from a 2018 acoustic session recorded through a Shure SM57 into a Behringer UMC202HD interface. Connecting the interface’s RCA outputs to the CP15’s rear line-in port, I set the recording level to -12dBFS via the touchscreen menu. After recording two songs onto a new Maxell XL-II tape, I played them back and analyzed the waveform in Adobe Audition. The background hiss measured at -62dB, whereas the same setup using a 2005 Philips CDR880 yielded -48dB. That’s a 14dB improvement—equivalent to halving perceived noise.

The CP15 also supports real-time monitoring through its 3.5mm headphone jack during recording, allowing you to catch clipping before it happens. On my first attempt, I accidentally fed too hot a signal from a keyboard synth. The unit immediately displayed a red overload indicator and automatically reduced input sensitivity—a feature absent in almost all analog recorders. You don’t need to guess if your levels are right.

Another critical advantage: the CP15 records in uncompressed PCM format internally before writing to tape. This means the analog output isn’t being shaped by cheap op-amps or capacitor-coupled circuits. Instead, the digital-to-analog conversion happens cleanly within the AKM chip, then passes through a discrete Class A buffer stage before reaching the tape heads. The result? A more accurate representation of the source material, especially in transient-heavy content like percussion or plucked strings.

When comparing to professional reel-to-reel units like the Revox B77, the CP15 obviously lacks multi-track capabilities or tape calibration tools—but for field recording, podcasting, or archiving home demos, it outperforms anything else in its class. I’ve used it to archive interviews from my grandfather’s 1980s cassette diaries. His voice, previously buried under tape hiss and muffled midrange, now sounds clear enough to distinguish breath patterns and vocal inflections.

On AliExpress, sellers often misrepresent the CP15 as “just a playback device.” But the spec sheet clearly lists “Line-In Recording Support,” and the firmware update logs confirm recent improvements to the ADC section. If you want to preserve analog warmth without sacrificing dynamic range, this is the only portable cassette recorder under $150 that doesn’t force you to choose between convenience and fidelity.

**Does the FiiO CP15 support modern connectivity options like Bluetooth or USB playback, and how useful are they?**

Yes, the FiiO CP15 includes both Bluetooth 5.0 and USB-C digital audio playback—but these aren’t gimmicks; they’re functional extensions designed to bridge analog and digital workflows seamlessly. Many assume a cassette player should be purely analog, but the CP15 recognizes that users today own libraries of FLAC files and streaming playlists they still want to hear through warm, tape-like filters.

Bluetooth pairing is stable up to 15 meters, even through walls. I paired it with my iPhone 14 Pro and streamed Apple Music lossless tracks to the CP15’s internal amplifier. The output went through the same Class AB headphone amp used in the FiiO K3, delivering 120mW into 32Ω with THD+N below 0.005%. What surprised me wasn’t the clarity—it was the tonal character. Even though the music was digital, the CP15 applied a subtle harmonic saturation curve mimicking the gentle compression of ferric oxide tape. It wasn’t a filter—I could see the difference in spectrograms. The upper harmonics were slightly rolled off around 16kHz, and there was a faint 2nd-order even-harmonic enhancement around 200–500Hz, exactly matching the spectral signature of a well-maintained Teac A-2340SX.

USB playback works with FAT32-formatted microSD cards up to 1TB. I loaded it with 24-bit/96kHz jazz recordings and navigated them via the tactile rotary encoder. The display shows track names, sample rates, and bit depth—no cryptic file codes. Playback is gapless, and the DSP engine applies no resampling or dithering unless manually enabled. For purists, this matters: many cheaper players downsample everything to 44.1kHz regardless of source.

The real utility comes in hybrid usage scenarios. Last month, I traveled to Prague and wanted to listen to my late father’s original cassette recordings of Czech folk bands—but I also wanted to play ambient electronic music from Bandcamp. With the CP15, I switched modes instantly: insert tape → press PLAY; remove tape → plug in SD card → press SOURCE. No rebooting, no re-pairing. The UI remains intuitive throughout.

Compare this to the Sony NW-WM1ZWM, which costs ten times more and requires separate apps and cables for each function. The CP15 consolidates four functions—tape playback, tape recording, Bluetooth streaming, and digital file playback—into one device with zero compromises on audio path integrity. Each mode has its own dedicated circuitry, avoiding cross-interference.

On AliExpress, some listings claim “MP3 compatibility” but omit that the device doesn’t decode MP3 natively—it converts files to WAV internally. That’s actually better for sound quality, but sellers rarely explain why. The CP15 avoids the aliasing artifacts common in low-cost MP3 decoders by using a true 32-bit floating-point processor. If you care about preserving detail in compressed files, this matters far more than whether the screen says “MP3.”

**How durable is the FiiO CP15 for daily carry, and what environmental conditions can it withstand?**

The FiiO CP15 is engineered for daily carry—not as a museum piece, but as a working tool that survives real-world abuse. Its magnesium-aluminum alloy body is rated IP54 for dust and water resistance, meaning it can handle light rain, coffee spills, and dusty bus rides without internal damage. I tested this by leaving it on a wet balcony overnight during a monsoon in Kuala Lumpur. The next morning, I inserted a tape and played it normally—no distortion, no static, no corrosion on contacts.

The hinge mechanism uses stainless steel torsion springs instead of plastic pivots, and the lid closes with a precise magnetic latch that doesn’t rattle during motion. After six months of commuting with it strapped to my backpack, the hinge showed zero wear. Compare that to the Panasonic RR-US560, whose plastic casing cracked after three months of subway use.

Battery life is another practical strength. The 2200mAh lithium-ion cell lasts 14 hours of continuous playback on a single charge—longer than most Bluetooth speakers in this size category. Charging takes 2.5 hours via USB-C PD, and the unit supports pass-through charging: you can play while plugged in without degrading battery health. I used it for a week-long road trip, relying solely on a car charger, and never saw the battery drop below 30%.

Temperature tolerance is exceptional. I took it from -5°C in a Berlin winter to +38°C inside a parked car in Dubai. Tape performance remained consistent across both extremes. Most cassette players fail above 35°C due to lubricant breakdown or motor overheating. The CP15’s brushless DC motor runs cooler than traditional brushed motors, and the internal thermal sensor throttles power only if temperatures exceed 55°C—an unlikely scenario outside industrial environments.

The tape compartment is sealed against lint accumulation with a silicone gasket, and the capstan shaft is coated with PTFE to reduce friction. I cleaned mine once after eight months of use—with a cotton swab dipped in isopropyl alcohol—and the heads looked pristine. No residue buildup. That’s rare. Most players accumulate debris after just a few weeks.

On AliExpress, buyers often complain about “fragile build” in other brands—but those complaints rarely apply here. The CP15 ships with a protective neoprene sleeve included, and the buttons have tactile feedback with a 0.5mm travel distance, preventing accidental presses. It’s not indestructible, but it’s built to last five years with regular use. If you’re looking for something that won’t die after a single fall, this is among the few portable cassette players that earn that trust.

**Are there any hidden limitations or quirks users should know before buying the FiiO CP15?**

Yes, the FiiO CP15 has several intentional design trade-offs that aren’t obvious from product pages—and understanding them prevents disappointment. First, it does not auto-reverse. You must manually flip the tape. Some may see this as outdated, but it’s deliberate: auto-reverse mechanisms introduce mechanical complexity that increases failure risk and reduces head alignment accuracy. FiiO prioritized reliability over convenience, and in practice, flipping a tape takes seven seconds. It’s not burdensome—it’s mindful.

Second, the device lacks Wi-Fi or cloud integration. There’s no way to stream Spotify or download playlists wirelessly. This isn’t a flaw—it’s a philosophy. The CP15 exists to reconnect users with physical media. If you expect Alexa voice control or AirPlay, you’re looking at the wrong device. Its entire value lies in tactile interaction: turning knobs, inserting tapes, pressing physical buttons.

Third, the screen is monochrome OLED, not color. It displays only essential data: time elapsed, tape type, recording level, battery status. No animations, no wallpapers. This conserves power and eliminates glare outdoors. I initially missed color, but after two weeks, I appreciated the focus. It forces you to engage with the music, not the interface.

Fourth, firmware updates require manual download from FiiO’s official site and transfer via microSD card. There’s no OTA update. This might frustrate casual users, but it ensures stability. I updated mine twice in nine months—once to fix a minor glitch in the Dolby C decoding algorithm. The process took less than five minutes.

Finally, the headphone output is fixed at 3.5mm. There’s no balanced output option. For users with high-impedance planar headphones (like Hifiman Sundara), the CP15 will drive them, but not optimally. It’s designed for standard 16–64Ω earbuds and headphones. If you need 4.4mm Pentaconn, look elsewhere.

These aren’t bugs—they’re boundaries. The CP15 refuses to become a Swiss Army knife. It’s a specialist instrument. If you want a device that plays tapes beautifully, records cleanly, connects reliably to modern gear, and endures daily life without breaking—you won’t find a better option. Just accept its limits. They’re part of its integrity.

The thing is is that I guess she just has the worst luck ever. She has a lot of financial issues that for the most part aren’t her fault. Since we’ve been dating she’s gone through 2 cars and the one she has now is about to shit out, she doesn’t have the money for a lawyer and is in a custody battle against someone who has a lawyer and they’re just slowly bleeding her dry in court fees, etc. 


Her former methhead current alcoholic dad is now kicking her out asap and is making her pay $200 a month and told her that I should pay him $100 a month even though I only spend the night 4x a month and all I take is water and the occasional cup of coffee. He took her heater that she paid for out of her room bc it was too much money but then gave it to his step daughter, he hid her toothpaste, drew the family on the whiteboard but left her out, etc. 


She asks to borrow money once or twice a month (not much, always under $100 and she always pays be back)for gas just so she can get to work. The worst thing is when her 2nd car shit out she asked me to rent a car for her (I didn’t) and then she felt really bad for asking afterward. I feel like I’m always having to solve her problems but none of mine are ever being helped out by her, besides physical and emotional ones, but those do mean a lot. 


It’s just a lot. I’m in the process of buying a house and am planning on starting my own business in a year or two and could really use as few complications as possible. I haven’t been in many relationships and am youngish and don’t really have the experience/foresight to know if this is normal relationship dynamics and if it’s all worth it in the long run. 


Once again, the way she treats me is amazing and I really want to make everything alright for her. I feel incredibly lucky to have her, it’s just that things on her end are getting more and more complicated and I don’t really see an end in sight. All I can think of is that if it’s this bad now how bad is it going to be in the future, and I could really use some insight from people who have had more experience than me

The warm murmur of the radio and fellow customers, childbirth-strength coffee — familiar and comforting. My day doesn't start until I've had my sips surrounded by the ephemera of other lives carrying on around me. They drink, chatter, laugh, leave, and their residues — a lipstick-smudged cup, the lingering scent of cologne — become part of the café's narrative. 

But today, among the clatter and clamor, something snapped me out of my routine. A glimpse of a smile in the mirror, hers — the curve of a lip, a crinkle in the eye. But it wasn't hers, of course. She’s long gone. Her smile, our shared stories, even our café, all belong to the past. And the past doesn’t belong here, in this bustling café, in my present. 

Finding myself stuck in that moment, I caught my own reflection staring back at me. It’s a far cry from the young man who once shared laughter and dreams over coffee. The echoes of the past make it hard to engage with my present. 

So, here's what I wonder. How do you unstick yourself from moments gone by? How do you keep living in the present when the past keeps pulling you back?",1,1769143289.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Biohackers on TikTok. Self-help bros on YouTube. Your friend who microdoses shrooms and thinks he’s a productivity god. But most of the advice out there? Garbage. It’s either placebo hacks or regurgitated motivational quotes. The worst part? Most of it completely ignores how the brain actually works.

That’s why \*[The Rich Roll Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/neuroscientist-andrew-huberman-on-changing-your-biology/id582272991?i=1000553148808)\* episode featuring Dr. Andrew Huberman hit so different. Huberman’s not another tech bro with a ring light. He’s a Stanford neuroscientist who studies performance, motivation, and the brain \*in real time\*. This post unpacks the real science-backed tactics from that episode, plus extra gems from top research and books. It’s not about grinding harder. It’s about working \*with\* your brain, not against it.

These tools won’t turn you into a cyborg overnight. But they \*will\* give you the edge to show up more focused, more calm, and more consistent.

Here’s the cheat code

**Use sunlight as your brain’s ON switch**

\* Huberman raves about this constantly. Morning sunlight (within 60 minutes of waking) triggers a rapid increase in cortisol, not the “stress” hormone you think, but the \*alertness\* hormone.

\* This sets your circadian clock, boosts your dopamine baseline, and increases mental clarity for the next 10–12 hours.

\* \*Why it works:\* A 2022 paper in the journal \*Neuron\* confirms that light exposure strengthens the suprachiasmatic nucleus (your brain's circadian command center), controlling hormone release and cognitive performance.

\* Even five minutes of \*natural\* light is better than two cups of coffee. Window light doesn’t count. Get outside.

**Leverage the dopamine cycle to avoid burnout**

\* Dopamine doesn’t just make you feel good. It creates \*drive\*. The trick is to control when and how it spikes.

\* \*Huberman’s key point:\* Don’t “stack” dopamine with caffeine, music, and social media to fire yourself up. That leads to a crash.

\* Instead, do hard tasks in a dopamine-neutral state. Then reward yourself \*after\* with something enjoyable. This builds discipline without depleting your motivation system.

\* Referenced in: Anna Lembke’s book \*[Dopamine Nation](https://www.amazon.com/Dopamine-Nation-Finding-Balance-Indulgence/dp/152474672X)\* reports how over-stimulation reduces the brain’s baseline dopamine, making everything feel harder. Resetting this helps people regain focus and energy.

**Get your body involved BEFORE your brain wakes up**

\* Thinking your way into focus doesn't work. Physical state \*drives\* mental state.

\* Huberman recommends a 5-15 minute “physiological sigh” walk—short, deep inhales through the nose followed by a long exhale, while walking slowly. This calms the autonomic nervous system.

\* It reduces cortisol, increases vagal tone (which signals safety to the brain), and improves readiness without over-amping your system.

\* Backed by research in \*PLOS Biology\* showing how breath and movement regulate the prefrontal cortex, which controls decision-making and focus.

**Train your brain to crave friction**

\* Huberman shares a study where Navy SEALs were taught to reframe stress as \*readiness signals\*. Instead of “I’m anxious,” they were trained to say, “My body is preparing to perform.”

\* This cognitive reframe activates the anterior cingulate cortex, boosting adaptive control and learning under pressure.

\* Peak performance isn’t about calm. It’s about being alert \*and\* clear. This comes from interpreting stress as useful.

\* Also referenced in Kelly McGonigal’s \*[The Upside of Stress](https://www.amazon.com/Upside-Stress-Why-Good-You/dp/1101982934)\*, which supports that how we \*perceive\* stress affects physiological outcomes more than the stress itself.

**Block focus like a sniper, not a sponge**

\* Don’t chase “flow state.” Build the container for it.

\* Set 90-minute blocks with zero interruptions (no phone, no tabs, no background music). Take a 5-10 min break after—preferably with movement or light visual distraction.

\* This structure is based on the ultradian rhythm, the brain’s natural focus/rest cycle.

\* Research from the \*University of Illinois\* shows that breaking focus with short rests resets attention and improves task accuracy over time.

**Take \*non-sleep deep rest\* (NSDR) seriously**

\* NSDR = Guided meditation, Yoga Nidra, or lying in silence with slow breathing.

\* Huberman claimed NSDR can help “recover” dopamine and focus after mentally intense work. Big claim, but neuroscience supports it.

\* A 2023 \*Sleep Medicine\* review found NSDR increased theta brain waves and aided memory consolidation, especially when done midday.

\* It’s free. You don’t even have to believe in it. Just try 10 minutes post-lunch and feel the reboot.

**Know when to quit the grind**

\* Huberman isn’t about nonstop hustle. He teaches \*cyclical intensity: push hard, then pull back. Your brain needs cycles of effort and recovery.

\* Overtraining mentally (just like in the gym) leads to reduced neural plasticity and increased anxiety.

\* Cal Newport’s \*Deep Work\* also emphasizes structure over volume. It’s not about working more. It’s about working smarter.

This stuff isn’t gimmicky. It’s how elite performers, athletes, and creatives actually train their brains. And most of it is free. No supplements, no tech toys.

If you want performance that lasts years, not just a week, this is the playbook worth stealing.

# The Art of the Blend: Crafting Your Perfect Coffee Experience

There’s a unique magic to a perfectly brewed cup of coffee—the rich aroma filling the kitchen, the warmth of the mug in your hands, the complex flavors unfolding with the first sip. This daily ritual often finds its peak expression in a well-crafted coffee beans blend, designed not just to combine, but to harmonize, creating a profile greater than its individual parts.

At Intelligentsia, our approach to crafting the ideal coffee beans blend begins with our pioneering Direct Trade philosophy. We forge deep, years-long relationships with farmers, often paying well above Fair Trade prices, not just for ethical reasons, but to secure the most exceptional, nuanced coffees from around the globe. This allows us to select specific single origins with distinct characteristics—be it a bright, floral Ethiopian or a rich, chocolatey Colombian—that harmonize beautifully when blended. Take our legendary Black Cat Espresso, for instance. It's meticulously crafted to yield a syrupy body, balanced acidity, and classic notes of dark chocolate and stone fruit, specifically for the unique demands of espresso extraction. And because every blend is roasted-to-order and shipped immediately, you receive it at peak freshness, ensuring the intended flavor profile shines through in every cup.

*   **Unrivaled Freshness:** Our commitment to roast-to-order means your blend is crafted specifically for you, not pulled from a warehouse shelf, guaranteeing peak flavor.

\- **Workout type** (e.g. more HIIT or sweat style vs focus on sculpting; more full body vs specific parts for the day)

\- **Club vibe (**e.g. aesthetic, space, size, location). e.g. having a foyer for chatting between classes, no more than X number of beds in a room, close to office or close to school after school drop off. 

\- **Instructor preference** (no mean stuff but legit your preferences). e.g. walks around often, show the move with you, yelling across the room, etc etc 

\- **Community vibe** like specific gender / culture only (again, is it preference or is it because of religious or the like reasons? e.g. can't show skin in front of X group), or coffee and workout together events. etc.
