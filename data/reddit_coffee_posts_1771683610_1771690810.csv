I’m looking for people who are happy to chat, voice and video calls and if you’re local, do cute little hangouts together (coffee dates, arcade days, random exploring days?? 🥰).

About me ✨

I LOVE exploring new places, cooking & baking (I will 100% feed you), painting, tennis, ice skating, bowling, arcades, candle making and shopping a little too much 🛍️

I’m into movies, anime, music, Pilates, and very unserious gaming (Just Dance confidence, COD skills… questionable 😭). I love Sanrio and cute animals! 

I’m a postgrad med student so life gets busy but I genuinely value deep, consistent friendships. I don’t mind online or IRL but just good energy and kindness 🤍

If you’re also looking for a wholesome, fun, slightly chaotic but loyal friend… message me!! Tell me your go-to coffee order or your comfort movie so we can start there ☕🎬

Lets prove that making friends in your 20s is possible ✨✨",1,1771690636.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1rav4ch,https://i.redd.it/z6ybkhmohvkg1.png,Cozy Morning Coffee Cake Baked Oatmeal – Family Favorite,"Just pulled this coffee cake baked oatmeal out of the oven and wow, did not expect it to taste this indulgent for something that's basically just oats and pantry staples. I've been trying to meal prep breakfasts that don't feel boring and remembered seeing something like this a while back. Honestly thought it might be too healthy-tasting but the crumb topping really makes it feel like an actual coffee cake. Here's how I made it: [https://www.platosinolvidables.com/coffee-cake-baked-oatmeal](https://www.platosinolvidables.com/coffee-cake-baked-oatmeal)  
  
Here's what I used:  
  
For the Oatmeal  
1 3/4 cups Old Fashioned Rolled Oats  
1 tsp baking powder  
1 tsp cinnamon  
1/4 tsp salt  
1-2 Tbsp flax, chia, or hemp seeds  
1 3/4 cups unsweetened almond milk or sub whatever milk you have on hand  
1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce can sub mashed banana  
1-2 Tbsp maple syrup  
  
For the Crumb Topping  
1/3 cup Old Fashioned Rolled Oats  
2 Tbsp raw sugar, coconut sugar, or cane sugar for a less sweet version, reduce sugar by half  
2 Tbsp cold butter or vegan butter  
1 tsp cinnamon  
  
What I did:  
  
1. Preheated my oven to 375 and sprayed an 8x8 pan with cooking spray.  
  
2. Dumped the oats, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and seeds right into the pan and mixed it all together.  
  
3. Stirred in the almond milk, vanilla, applesauce, and maple syrup until everything was combined.  
  
4. For the topping, I pulsed 1/3 cup oats in my food processor until it looked like flour. Added the cold butter, sugar, and cinnamon and pulsed a few more times until it got crumbly.  
  
5. Sprinkled the crumb topping over the oatmeal mixture.  
  
6. Baked it for 30 minutes until the oatmeal was set and the topping looked crispy.  
  
Pro tip: I drizzled some almond butter on top when serving and it was next level. The crumb topping gets actually crispy which I wasn't expecting, so don't skip that step. I used flax seeds because that's what I had but I'm sure any of those options would work. Also heads up, this makes 6 servings so it's great for meal prep. I cut mine into squares and they reheated perfectly in the microwave the next couple mornings.  
  
Fair warning though, if you're used to super sweet coffee cake this is more lightly sweetened. I used the full 2 tablespoons of maple syrup and thought it was perfect but my husband would've liked it sweeter. Next time I might try adding some blueberries to the mix or maybe chocolate chips if I'm feeling wild.

I meet a girl, we see each other sometimes at work/uni and talk occasionally when our friend groups intertwine. We have a couple nice talks, couple laughs here and there and maybe a couple flirtatious jokes. I start liking her and I start thinking about her more and more with each day. I try to message her, ask her what she's up to, maybe ask her out for a coffee or something and I get the driest responses ever.  Straight up just liking my replies with no response or I get left on read. I end up feeling like a dumbass for even trying. It's so demoralizing because I'm just trying to get to know her better and hang out but even that can't be done.


I don't have trouble with other girls. I'm fairly funny and outgoing and a lot of girls I've met have complimented me for different aspects of my looks. I've went on dates and talked with other girls in-between and before these two girls but I just wasn't interested in them(ironic I know) or I wasn't interested in what they wanted from the relationship. I'm at a point where I'd want a serious relationship with someone I really like. It's not my number one priority so I'm not putting myself out there as much as I could but these moments where I've felt romantic and thought ""this is it"" ended up being complete duds.

1rav1y9,https://youtu.be/RU3pcHFClP0?si=skedWcB79jDhzBWS,Two of us did all the VFX for our sci-fi action short in After Effects. Just won Best VFX at a festival.,"Hey r/VFX. I directed and co-did the VFX on a sci-fi action short called TEMPORAL TAKEDOWN. It just won Best VFX at the Urban Action Showcase International Action Film Festival in New York. The entire film was made for \~$1,800, and all VFX were done in After Effects with some Maxon plugins.

Some breakdowns on what we did:

**The time-freeze effect:** Inspired by the shield effect in the Dune films, then tweaked a lot to fit our story. We wanted it to feel physical and grounded rather than flashy.

**Subsurface skin glow:** The glowing-under-skin look was the result of a lot of research and watching tutorials on subsurface skin glow. Andrew Kramer has a great one that was a good starting point. Lots of iteration from there.

**Anamorphic flares:** All comped in to give it that more cinematic anamorphic look. None of those flares were in-camera.

**The coffee cup smoke:** Fun one. All the shots at the beginning where you see the coffee cup with steam rising, that smoke/haze is comped in. We had hot water on set but couldn't see the smoke clearly enough in the edit, so we added it in post.

All of this was done by myself and our editor/VFX artist Jens Peder Hertzberg, just the two of us in After Effects. Happy to answer questions about any of the shots.",2,1771690432.0,vfx,0,1.0,False

I never really used to workout at all while maintaining that weight and didn’t particularly care about eating healthy foods. Recently some added stress has caused me to gain about 30lbs and I’m sitting more around 160lbs now. 

My job requires me to be on my feet all day so I’m definitely not as sedentary as I used to be and am getting more steps in along with some weekly exercise, but I’ve been stagnant for a few months now even though I’m objectively more active than I used to be.

I’ve very recently started adding pilates into my routine, but I work 6 days a week and don’t do it daily. 

One thing I’ve noticed I’ve been doing unintentionally is only eating one meal a day now. I don’t feel hungry in the mornings so skip breakfast aside from coffee, I can’t really bring myself to bother with lunch at work because of the schedule, and then when I leave work I’m hungry so I get dinner. 

It depends on the day, but usually it’s not the healthiest dinners. I’m not eating fast food every day, but I’m also not eating salads and smoothies every day. I don’t count calories, I don’t always eat the full meal, I just eat until I’m full. I’m not gaining any more weight either, for the past 4-5 months, I’ve been about 160lbs, almost never over 162 and never under 158. 

I’ve always had semi-unhealthy eating habits, but I used to eat multiple meals a day. 

So now I’m wondering if I’m staying so stagnant in weight because I’m messing with my metabolism by only eating once a day? Should I be eating smaller meals and snacks throughout the day? Is it solely a calorie thing? 

TLDR: I gained some weight and want to lose it. I’m more physically active than I used to be and mostly eating the same kinds of food, but not losing any weight. 

The one thing I’ve noticed that’s changed is I eat one meal a day now instead of smaller meals and snacks. So I’m wondering if that’s why I’m not losing any weight. 

I know eating healthy and working out obviously help, but when I weighed less I wasn’t working out at all basically and I was eating the same semi-unhealthy food while maintaining my weight. So if I’m eating the same type of food and actually working out now, shouldn’t that be helping me lose weight instead of maintaining like I used to?

I went in with low expectations because I'm not a big Kevin James fan and the movie is produced by Angel Studios, which makes a lot of family-friendly (conservative?) movies. The movie did have a good rating on IMDB.

The structure is typical rom-com. Kevin is stranded at the alter in Italy. While he is wallowing in his misery, he meets a very engaging coffee shop owner. Hilarity ensues.

There were a bunch of good gags, suprising cameos and a great performance by Nicole Grimaudo as the love interest. As a middle-aged man myself, I could see the appeal of ditching my life in the US for that type of woman in Italy.

Its probably out of theaters by now. Check it out when it gets to streaming.

Thanks for reading my review! Check out my Substack for all reviews: [Gatecrashing's Substack | Gatecrashing With M.Jontae | Substack](https://gatecrashingwithmjontae.substack.com/)

*Anita and Vernon have lunch at the club*. Unfortunately, Anita is unable to enjoy the Creole cuisine from the special menu. Vernon attempts to bring Anita back up, but Leslie spoils the mood. They try to let Leslie down easy, but per usual, she can’t take a hint. While Leslie was being relatively harmless, she is so intrusive. In Leslie’s mind the world truly revolves around her. She is actually unhinged, drunk or not.

I really don’t understand why people continue to humor Leslie. Her invading Vernon and Anita’s meal was too much. Leslie seems to believe that money can buy her anything, even things she does not deserve.

I don’t know what kind of mother Peaches was, but Leslie yearns for Anita’s approval, and maybe some of her motherly love. She showed genuine concern for Anita, which was a change for the better. I don’t know what direction they are taking Leslie in, but the character needs an update.

*Jacob and Elon get into it at the station*. I am really glad that we are seeing more of Elon. I don’t know if it is concern, or if Elon is involved in the ring himself, but why is he pushing Jacob so hard? Some investigations take years to wrap up. Jacob has been on the case for two seconds. I hate that Elon feels like he can constantly pull rank as a father and superior officer when he is wrong.

*Tomas and Lynette get coffee at Caffeine Fix*. Lynette looks great, but her need to rehash this terrifying story with such enthusiasm wasn’t very smart. She should still be traumatized. Tomas’ “unreal” line was spot on, but it went over Ms. Scammer’s head. Even though Lynette is only acting, “just a paralegal” was out of pocket. What would attorneys do without their paralegals?

Using Bill against Tomas is getting old. Also, how does Lynette have the pull to rope Bill in? Through Hayley, which makes their collaboration clearer. Not to mention her slip-up. Lynette requesting that Hayley deliver the papers is such a small detail, and they still failed to get their story together. Lynette already thinks she has the money in hand; she’s getting sloppy. There is no surprise that Tomas decided to look deeper into Lynette.

*Naomi visits Hayley at the hotel to Hayley’s surprise*. I can see why Naomi and Ashley are best friends. They both have the absolute need to fix other people, so that they don’t have to work on themselves. When Naomi finds out that she was defending her character to her monster of a mother-in-law, she is going to have a conniption. I am sick and tired of Naomi’s saint act.

Was it a punch or a beating, Hayley? Also, did Naomi forget her reservations about Hayley’s “pregnancy” that quickly? Hayley is lucky that calling Naomi her stepdaughter didn’t get her another black eye. Bill menacingly enters the room right when Naomi is considering reconciliation.

How did Bill showing genuine concern for his daughter turn into him taking a shot at Jacob and making everything about the mugging again? I wonder if Naomi realizes that the “everything” Hayley was talking about is the life the Bill affords her, at least while he currently has life.

*Randy and Lynette talk at Uptown after he summons her*. I think Lynette forgot the plot. What was she even talking about? In what world is Randy not going to save himself over Hayley and Lynette? I don’t know if Lynette simply rolled the dice, or did she really believe that her bark was going to scare off Randy?

*Bill and Hayley discuss Naomi*. There are times that the writing really strays from believability. Whether or not Naomi and Jacob go on a double date with Bill and Hayley, doesn’t negate Naomi’s concern for Hayley after the mugging. Bill has to see this. I am not even sure what Hayley stands to gain by coyly putting this out there. Of course, Bill will force Hayley’s wishes on Naomi, no matter how she feels, to overcompensate for his wayward nature. I guess Hayley has not truly won until she bends everyone to her will.

*Naomi and Jacob talk*. This illegal plasma ring must be very profitable. Or perhaps Jacob was exaggerating about the “bullet between the eyes” thing. Jacob is literally undercover at the moment. Returning to the police station or his home is very dangerous, as the operation may have eyes on him.

Naomi makes no sense, and it seems like she relies heavily on Bill, which allows for a great deal of recklessness. However, I think Jacob forgot who he was talking to. There are better ways to let your wife know that you are in so deep that you have to get a secret place.

**Overall Assessment**

This episode was clearly a filler. It actually did the opposite of creating interest in the burgeoning storylines. If one good thing came from this episode, it was Naomi and Jacob seemingly getting back on track.

Discussion Points: Will Bill’s pacification of Hayley lead to him uncovering Jacob’s new case? Was Lynette’s misstep a fatal blow to the scam? Will Lynette be able to change Randy’s mind with her womanly wiles? Will Tomas be the one to crack the case? Will Jacob going deep undercover bring him and Naomi closer?

To understand why, you have to look at Kaspi’s business model: it is a **""Super App""** that dominates Kazakhstan, combining three massive pillars into one ecosystem: **Payments** (like Venmo/PayPal), **Marketplace** (like Amazon), and **Fintech** (like a traditional bank + Affirm-style Buy Now, Pay Later).

Because Kaspi captures almost every digital transaction a consumer makes in their daily life, they possess an incredibly rare **closed-loop data ecosystem**. AI thrives on vast, interconnected data, making Kaspi a textbook beneficiary of the AI revolution.

#  Fintech and BNPL: Hyper-Accurate Credit Underwriting

Kaspi generates a significant portion of its profits from consumer lending and Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) financing.

* **Alternative Data Advantage:** Traditional banks rely on lagging indicators like credit scores. Because Kaspi is also a payment network and a marketplace, their AI models can underwrite risk using real-time behavioral data. AI can analyze how often a user pays utility bills, their grocery shopping habits, and even how they navigate the app, to assess creditworthiness.
* **Micro-Targeted BNPL:** AI can predict exactly *when* a consumer is most likely to need financing. If the AI detects a user browsing refrigerators on the Kaspi Marketplace, it can instantly offer a pre-approved, dynamically priced BNPL loan right at the point of intent.
* **Financial Impact:** Lower Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) and decreased default rates, which directly expands Fintech profit margins, allowing Kaspi to lend to demographics traditional banks won't touch.

  
Marketplace: The Ultimate Personalization Engine

Kaspi’s e-commerce marketplace is the dominant player in its region. AI transitions the app from a place where people *search* for goods to a place that *predicts* what they want.

* **Recommendation Algorithms:** Similar to TikTok or Amazon, AI deep-learning models will analyze a user's entire Kaspi history (what they buy, what they click, who they send money to) to curate a hyper-personalized home screen feed. This drastically increases conversion rates.
* **Merchant Solutions:** Kaspi relies on thousands of SME (Small and Medium Enterprise) merchants. Kaspi can provide these merchants with AI-driven dashboards that predict inventory shortages, suggest dynamic pricing to beat competitors, and automate their digital ad spending within the Kaspi app.
* **Financial Impact:** Higher Gross Merchandise Value (GMV), increased merchant advertising revenue, and a higher ""take rate"" for Kaspi. 

# Generative AI for Operational Scale

Kaspi operates at massive scale (over 13 million monthly active users in a country of roughly 20 million people). Managing that volume requires significant customer service and operational overhead.

* **Automated Support:** Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) can handle the vast majority of customer inquiries (e.g., ""Where is my delivery?"", ""Why was my card declined?"", ""How do I return this item?""). AI agents can resolve these instantly in native languages (Kazakh and Russian).
* **Financial Impact:** As Kaspi grows, their SG&A (administrative) expenses will decouple from their revenue growth. They can scale transactions exponentially without needing to hire proportionally larger call centers or support staff.

  
Fraud Prevention and Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

Operating a massive peer-to-peer payment network comes with high fraud risks.

* **Real-Time Pattern Recognition:** AI models can analyze thousands of transactions per second to detect microscopic anomalies. If a user’s phone is suddenly making transfers from a new IP address, at an unusual time, to an unverified merchant, AI can freeze the transaction in milliseconds.
* **Financial Impact:** Reduced chargebacks, lower fraud losses, and maintaining high trust in the Kaspi brand.

# The Closed-Loop Advantage

In the US or Europe, data is fragmented. Amazon knows what you buy; Chase Bank knows your balance; Apple Pay knows how you transact.

**Kaspi knows all three.**

When you train an AI model on a fragmented dataset, it guesses. When you train an AI model on a **closed-loop ecosystem**, it *knows*. Kaspi sees the income arrive in the user's account, sees the user pay for a coffee via QR code, and sees them take out a loan for a TV. This unified data layer makes Kaspi's AI models exponentially smarter, faster, and more accurate than any standalone bank or standalone retailer trying to compete with them.

1rausll,https://www.reddit.com/r/DentalVeneersColombia/comments/1rausll/my_honest_review_of_dental_trip_to_colombia/,My Honest Review of Dental Trip to Colombia,"I’m officially back from Medellín, and honestly? My suitcase is full of coffee, and my mouth is full of teeth that cost me about a third of what I was quoted back home.

If you’ve been following my stories, you know I was stressing about this ""dental vacation"" idea. Getting major work done is scary enough, but doing it in another country? I had my doubts. But after 7 days in Colombia, I’m a total convert. Here is how my ""glow-up"" week actually went down.

# Why I Pulled the Trigger

Let’s be real: my local quote for veneers and some restorative work was basically the price of a mid-sized SUV. I did some digging, found an incredible clinic in Medellín, and realized I could get world-class care, a round-trip flight, and a week in a luxury Airbnb for way less than just the dental bill at home.

# My 7-Day Playbook

* **Days 1–2: The Deep Dive.** I landed and went straight to the clinic. I was expecting something ""medical,"" but this place looked like a tech startup. We did 3D scans and a digital mock-up where I literally got to ""approve"" my new smile on a screen before they even touched a tooth.



* **Days 3–5: Work & Wander.** While the lab was custom-making my veneers, I had some downtime. I spent my mornings at the clinic and my afternoons riding the cable cars over the city and drinking way too much world-class espresso. (Pro tip: Medellín is steep—wear good shoes!)



* **Day 6: The Grand Finale.** The big day. I spent a few hours in the chair getting everything bonded. When I finally looked in the mirror? No ""chicklet"" teeth, no fake-looking white. Just a natural, bright version of me.



* **Day 7: The Final Polish.** A quick visit to check my bite and make sure everything felt 100%. I spent the rest of the day showing off my new smile at a rooftop restaurant before heading to the airport.

**The Verdict:** 10/10. I didn't just save a fortune; I actually had a blast. But—and this is a big *but*—you have to do your homework. I spent weeks vetting my doctor.

  
How to Make Sure Your Clinic is Legit

If you’re thinking about doing this, don't just book the first place you see on Instagram. Here is the ""Alex-approved"" checklist of questions to ask before you buy a plane ticket:

**1. Qualifications & Accreditations**

* Are your dentists board-certified, and can I see their credentials/specialties?
* Is the clinic accredited by international bodies (like the ADA, AACD, or local equivalents like the Colombian Dental Federation)?

**2. Technology & Materials**

* What brands of materials do you use for implants or veneers? (Look for names like Straumann, Zimmer, or E.max).
* Do you have an in-house lab, or do you outsource the work?

**3. Logistics & Aftercare**

* What is your 'guarantee' policy if a crown or veneer fails once I’m back home?
* Do you provide a detailed treatment plan and a breakdown of costs in writing before I arrive?
* How many days do I *strictly* need to be in the city for this specific procedure?

**4. Communication**

* Do the doctors and staff speak fluent English (or my native language)?
* Can I speak directly with the dentist via a video call before I book?

If you’re looking to skip the DIY research headache, just head over to [**Thehealthytreatment.com**](http://Thehealthytreatment.com) and hit ""Request a Quote."" They’ve already done the heavy lifting by vetting certified dentists on their platform.

It’s super transparent—you can browse reviews for each doctor and compare prices side-by-side to find a fit for your budget. Plus, you can even hop on a **Video Consultation** to get a feel for your dentist before you ever book a flight.",1,1771689811.0,DentalVeneersColombia,0,1.0,False

This store still had the Tiramisu Crookie (which I’ve been neglecting to try) and I walked in to to see my favorite Chip City cookie of all time: Nutella Cinnamon Roll! It wasn’t even listed on the app, so that was a great surprise! Anyways, let’s get into the new treats…

Galaxy Brownie Crookie: LOVED THIS! The regular galaxy cookie is great, but it is like a chocolate overload, which can be a bit overwhelming. Not the Crookie though, it was a perfect amount of fudge mixed with the softness of the croissant that I love. Amazing.

Tiramisu Crookie: I didn’t think I was going to like this because I don’t drink coffee, but the coffee taste wasn’t overpowering. Generous amount of cream cheese and not a heavy treat at all. Blew away my expectations.

Blueberry Cheesecake Chewie Wich: This was great! Blueberry and cream cheese were perfectly balanced. I love the direction they’re going with by adding fruit chewie wiches.

Chilly Philly: This is the one we’re all curious about, and in here to say… it was fine? It didn’t really taste like anything, There wasn’t much cream cheese and it wasn’t very flavorful when I did get to it. Forgettable overall.

I also had the Horchata, PBJ chewie wich, Cookies N Cream, and Nutella Cinnamon Roll. All of these are some of the best treats Chip City has to offer, so a strong week in my opinion. Side comment: I’m considering making a Chip City review account (possibly other food as well) on Instagram. If I follow through on that, would you guys be ok with me promoting the page on here? I’m 50/50 on it but it would be nice to give more exposure to Chip City. Have a great weekend everyone!",5,1771689539.0,ChipCityCookies,0,1.0,False
1raumlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1raumlr/itinerary/,Itinerary,"\*\*\*This is a very rough draft. I only listed ""Day 1"" in the sections because I haven't planned out the days yet. I am mostly wondering thoughts on if this is a good plan for the number of days per area, and if we are missing anything major that we should add in. We were heavily considering Khao Sok & Koh Lipe/Lanta but ultimately decided Khao Yai & Koh Kang/Mak/Chang instead. We are hoping for a mix of cultural/nature/wildlife/foodie/adventure experience and avoiding major tourist traps. This is our first time to Thailand, traveling out of Boston, Massachusetts, USA,  and the trip is for our honeymoon. 

\*\*\*probably will not go to Ratchaburi / Pattaya but left the little bullet points in just as a jumping off point if we do want to try to fit them in. 



Bangkok (4 days)



**General Tips:**

Reddit Accomodation advice- Unless you are traveling on a tight budget, stay around the Asok, Sukhumvit interchange near Terminal 21 for your first time in Bangkok. It is convenient to both the MRT and BTS so most tourist areas are within a 15 minute max ride. Also convenient to Jodd Fair and about a 1,000 malls. Accommodations are available from Western Upscale chains (Marriott, Hilton, etc) to local hotels. Nightlife is within walking distance or a short train ride.

**Grab** (ride share app) is extremely cheap. Remember to use the discount vouchers in the Grab app. They are in Thai but you figure out what they mean by the % it states.



**Day 1:** 

* **Chinatown** \- Yaowarat Road 
   * One vendor I always recommend sits near the start of the strip, making the famous Thai donuts served with pandan custard. Michelin-rated and absolutely addictive
* **Rooftop Bars** \- 
   * Vertigo & Moon Bar (Banyan Tree Hotel): One of the OG rooftops with open-air views and an ultra-luxury feel. Ideal for a splurge night.
* Octave Rooftop Lounge ([Marriott Hotel Sukhumvit](https://mn-tz.ltd/re?campaign_id=84&marker=385902&p=2076&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.booking.com%2Fsearchresults.en-gb.html%3Fdest_id%3D465971%26dest_type%3Dhotel&trs=189730&trace_id=Zz0e88811fe9814a4db489b6f-385902&install_type=am_partner_content&product_type=emerald&journey_id=Mai2CBFb_XmA7K6kDtJ6M&promo_kind=tp_long_with_tooltip_widget&page_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftravelhiatus.com%2Fbest-things-to-do-in-bangkok%2F&is_tooltip=true&tooltip_subtype=search&promo_subkind=tooltip_desktop_general)): Trendy, spacious, and 360° views.

I’m constantly watching tips to improve my form and always trying new workouts when I go. I still am very much a newbie and I’m sure when I go, that is obvious.

Here’s some context:

In 2023, I finally had enough of feeling bad about myself and my appearance. It’s been a struggle and insecurity for me for as long as I can remember. In 2021, I reached my highest weight of 209lbs. I began a calorie deficit, nothing crazy. Not only did I struggle with weight gain as a young adult, I also struggled with restrictive ED’s as a teenager.   So when I started the calorie deficit, my intention was to lose weight slowly, sustainably, and pay more attention to how I felt than how I looked. Which worked! It took about 2 years but I lost over 100lbs. I didn’t step on the scale for 2 entire years. I felt amazing. I could stand longer, breathe easier and my feet and back pain virtually went away.

Flash forward to now. For reference, I’m 5’1” and currently 95 pounds, which I know is underweight. That was not my intention. As I lost weight, my appetite shifted. I feel full faster and for longer. When I started going to the gym a few months back, my goal was to build muscle, not lose any more weight.

The problem is that the scale is not moving. My maintenance calories (according to the online TDEE) sit around \~1500 but I don’t track anymore. The only thing I truly measure these days is coffee creamer because it’s so easy to unintentionally make 700+ calorie coffees (oops), but anyways, I always try to hit 1500 bare minimum. I eat breakfast, lunch and dinner and I loveee a good chocolatey snack. I don’t beat myself up if I go over, I try to stay consistent. So I’m confused on why it’s gone down over the last few weeks.

How do I build muscle? Ideally I’d like to be around \~115-125 pounds. The obvious answer is to eat more but truthfully I feel like I’m stuffing myself, and it’s physically uncomfortable. I know protein is important, and I google says I should be aiming for around 40g per day. What are some good tips and tricks to hit that number?

Any advice is appreciated.",2,1771689352.0,beginnerfitness,2,1.0,False

I tried it last night. It’s like very sweet Jack and Coke without the alcohol. I don’t know, it didn’t taste all that great to me. But what do I know about tastes and flavors, right?

The assistant to the regional manager (let’s call him ARM for short, which is kind of fitting since he used to work out for a living) has become drastically nicer to me lately. Guess I’ve stuck around long enough for him to realize that I’m worth building a higher level of rapport with. I like him quite a bit. Cold at the beginning, but a teddy bear on the inside. He’s sweet. And I love his girlfriend, too. She’s one cool cat.

I want to make orange ice cream next. The orange ganache I made last time lacked the orange.. shoulda used zest, too. Too bad, so sad. What spices do I want to use for the ice cream? Should I just make it orange-cream flavored? Keep It Simple Stupid?

Can’t seem to make non-burnt caramel to save my life. Suppose I should practice more.. nah, too lazy. Burnt caramel ain’t too bad if you throw enough salt and cream into it.

W has been unusually friendly with me lately, too. Guess it somehow finally got through to him that I’ve always liked his being. Or did you have something to do with it? Maybe it was the tannic-ass muffins I made for him after he helped me out that one time. I learned whilst trying out your recipe that one wants to use dried cherries instead of fresh ones.. because tannins. Also I cut the salt a little too much for that batch. The first batch I had made was a tad bit too salty. Woe is me, I have no in between. By the way, I really appreciated that you took the time to write out the recipes so neatly, just for me (I assume.. ah, Assumption. I love that I can alliterate it with Atrocious).

I had a computer class as an elective back in middle school. The teacher's last name was Gould. It was the first time I had to seek my way to my classes, so I asked around where the computer lab was. Goulda Woulda Shoulda Coulda. Kept asking where Ms “Good” was. Turned out it was pronounced “Goo-ld.” English is weird. Names are hard. I meant it when I said your name’s super fun to say.

“You good?” Always good. Good good good. Always good, perpetually fine, nothing wrong, everything is excellent. Sure.

Have you ever read The Little Prince? I will admit, I rolled my eyes when it turned out to be her favorite book. Because it’s most people’s favorite book. I didn’t much care for the movie adaptation. I wished that they hadn’t added the modern storyline.

I always wondered if the Fox and the Rose would have gotten along.

Jake Sanderson - **YES.** He is superstitious and caffeinated. Backpack. 

Jack Hughes - **YES.** He is in the same spot in the first three and then in the same spot in the next two. Respect the mojo adjustment. 

Brock Nelson - **YES.** He is literally in the exact same spot in each photo.

Clayton Keller - **NO.** He’s only in three photos but his posture in the last one says “I’m just standing here for Nelson” 

J.T. Miller - **NO.** To the surprise of no one, JT Miller doesn’t give a fuuuuuck 

Matt Boldy - **YES.** Respect to the vibes adjustment. He is in the same spot in the first three, then in the same spot in the next two 

Matthew Tkachuk - **YES.** He doesn’t care who’s next to him but he’s in roughly the same spot every time. Probably more about the routine of it.

Vincent Trocheck - **YES.** Extreme yes. He looks like Eminem just took the mic in every photo

Tage Thompson - **NO.** Tage makes his own luck. 

Auston Matthews - **YES**. There’s one variation but the gist is the same

Jaccob Slavin - **NO.** You don’t need superstition when you have the Lord. 

Noah Hanifin - **ISH**. Maybe he just likes touching Tkachuk bros? Couldn’t be me. Anyways 

Brady Tkachuk - **YES.** Same as his bro to nobody’s surprise. Roughly the same spot but it’s also no biggie. 

Zach Werenski- **YES**. He’s in the same spot in the first two and then same in the next three. Change the vibes and thrive Big W

Dylan Larkin - **NO.** He is a vibe though. Dude just wants his coffee 

Charlie McAvoy - **YES.** Or maybe no. He’s on the same side in 4/5 and then randomly switches it up. 

Jake Guentzel - **YES.** Superstitious and gets more so the longer he keeps playing. You lean with it rock with it Guentz you look great

Jack Eichel - **NO**. Jack Eichel is superstitious and has said so in interviews but we’re going off these photos so he’s not. He’s on the same side in every photo but bounces around. Photo is about the routine rather than the voodoo 

Quinn Hughes - **YES.** Same side in every photo and why else would he and Jack be consistently separated? 

Brock Faber - **NO.** Or maybe he is idk I’m distracted by how precious he looks with his glasses. 

Connor Hellebuyck - **YES**. Goalie",24,1771688737.0,hockey,5,0.78,False

1rau9a1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rau9a1,Obsessive Compulsive Disorder," I think Taeha has OCD. I mean… this man notices when the rose petals in his condo are even slightly moved and remembers exactly how he placed FL’s stuff on his coffee table. That’s not normal attention to detail. It would also explain why he’s always eating lollipops and has this fixation on the FL, but in a way that isn’t overly toxic. I also feel like even when the FL hurts him with her words or actions, he just internalizes it instead of lashing out or being openly angry. Well… until the recent chapters. But even now, his anger is quiet. It’s not explosive…it’s heavy and contained.

It almost feels like he believes that’s all he deserves to endure the pain and just absorb it. Like his feelings don’t really matter. And the way he puts the FL first every single time, even when it’s hurting him, feels twisted in a way that’s definitely not healthy. It’s not pure selflessness it feels more like self-punishment disguised as love. (obv I don’t think he’s a green flag but more in the middle of a green and Red flag )

Idk, maybe he has other mental health stuff going on too, but OCD definitely feels like one of them.

·         The Moment Everything Changed!

·         Few Days Ago, I was sitting in a Tea/coffee shop when my hands started shaking.

·         Not from caffeine. From stress.

·         My mind was racing. Three projects. Two deadlines. One giant headache brewing behind my eyes.

·         Then I noticed the guy next to me. He was calm. Focused. And he was fidgeting with a pen in a way that looked... purposeful.

·         I asked him about it.

·         **Turns out, he was using an anxiety pen—a fidget pen designed to help people manage stress through controlled fidgeting.**

·         **And here's the thing: it actually works.**

·         I bought one that day. And after three weeks of using it, I realized something important.

·         Most of us are walking around with untreated anxiety because we're looking for complicated solutions.

·         An anxiety pen is the opposite of complicated.

·         It's simple. It's portable. It's discreet.

·         And it can genuinely change how your nervous system responds to stress.

# What Exactly Is an Anxiety Pen?

·         Let me be straight with you.

·         An Anxiety Pen is a pen that you can write with, but also fidget with.

·         Some anxiety pens aren’t pens you write with.

·         It's a fidget tool disguised as a pen.

·         It has different buttons, switches, clickers, and spinning parts that keep your hands busy. Your brain busy. Sometimes it has magnets or textured grips. And your stress levels down.

·         Some people call them fidget pens. Others call them stress relief pens.

·         The name changes. The effect doesn't.

·         Here's what happens in your brain: when you fidget with an anxiety pen, you're giving your hands something to do. That sounds dumb, but it's not. Your nervous system calms down when it has a simple task to focus on.

·         It's not a therapy to cure-all. It's a tool.

·         **Think of it like a tiny stress gym for your fingers.**

·         Your hands move.

·         Your mind gets a little break.

·         And sometimes tools are exactly what we need.

# Why Your Anxiety Pen Actually Works (The Science Part, Made Simple)

·         Your brain has two speeds: focused and scattered.

·         Most anxious people live in the scattered lane.

·         When you use an anxiety pen, you're creating what psychologists call ""motor engagement."" Your hands stay busy. Your mind stops running in circles.

·         The fidgeting activates a part of your brain that helps regulate emotions.

·         It's like giving your anxiety a single lane to drive in instead of letting it crash around everywhere.

·         The best anxiety pens let you switch between different motions. Click. Spin. Roll. Push. Each motion gives your hands a different job.

·         This variety keeps your mind from getting bored and falling back into the stress loop.

# Anxiety Pen vs Fidget Spinner Effectiveness: What I've Learned

·         Here's the difference with an anxiety pen vs fidget spinner:

·         Spinners are one-trick ponies. You spin. That's it.

·         An anxiety pen has multiple functions. Click, spin, roll, switch, and push.

·         More options mean more ways to stay engaged.

·         Also, spinners are obvious. Everyone stares at you.

·         An anxiety pen looks like... a pen. You can use it in meetings. During calls. In public. Nobody notices.

·         That matters more than you'd think.

# Why Anxiety Pen Deals Matter (And Where to Find Them)

·         **Here's the reality:** you can get a good anxiety pen for under $20.

·         And that changes everything.

·         Because if you're sceptical (you should be), a $15 investment isn't risky.

·         You can test it. See if it works for you. And move on if it doesn't.

·         The best anxiety pen deals and discounts come from:

·         Amazon, eBay (watch for seller discounts), Etsy (handmade options if you want something custom)

·         Direct from manufacturer websites.

·         Look for the affordable anxiety relief pens section on these sites.

·         You'll find bundles. Discounts. Sales.

·         The anxiety pen lowest price I've seen is around $6-8 for basic models.

·         But honestly? Spend the extra $5-7 and get one with multiple functions.

·         It's worth it.

# The Real Benefits: What I Actually Noticed After Three Weeks

·         I kept a journal when I started using my anxiety pen.

·         **Here's what changed:**

·         My hands stopped shaking during stressful conversations.

·         **Before:** I'd grip the armrest. Clench my fists. Sweat.

·         **After:** I fidget with my pen. My hands stay relaxed.

·         I stopped checking my phone as much.

·         The pen gives me something to do with my hand that isn’t mindless scrolling.

·         I could focus longer during calls.

·         When my hands were busy with the pen, my mind stayed on the conversation.

·         I felt less jumpy in traffic.

·         Sitting still used to make me tense. The pen changed that.

·         These aren't placebo effects. These are real shifts in how my nervous system behaves.

·         Here's what separates the good ones from the ones that sit in a drawer:

# Anxiety Pen Pros and Cons: The Honest Breakdown

# The Pros:

·         Portable and discreet

·         Affordable entry point

·         Multiple fidget options in one tool

·         No batteries or charging needed

·         Helps with focus during meetings and calls

·         Can reduce nervous habits like nail biting

# The Cons:

·         Not a replacement for therapy

·         Some people won't see results

·         Cheap versions break easily

·         Can become a distraction if over-used

·         May not work for severe anxiety

·         Fidgeting in quiet rooms can be annoying

·         Here's the thing: the pros outweigh the cons.

·         But you need to go in with realistic expectations.

#  How to Use Your Anxiety Pen for Maximum Benefit

·         Don't just click it randomly.

·         Be intentional.

# When You're Stressed:

·         Pick one motion. Stick with it for 60 seconds.

·         If that works, keep going. If not, switch motions.

# During Meetings:

·         Use it quietly. Spin the barrel or roll the clicker.

·         Keep your hands below the table.

·         When You're Anxious About Something Specific:

·         Use your pen as a physical anchor.

·         When your mind goes to the worry, bring it back to the sensation in your hands.

# Before Sleep:

·         If anxiety keeps you awake, use your pen for 10 minutes before bed.

·         The repetitive motion can calm your nervous system.

# Is an Anxiety Pen Right for You?

·         If any of these apply to you, an anxiety pen could help:

·         Your hands shake when you're nervous

·         You fidget constantly with whatever's nearby

·         You need something discreet for work or school

·         You want an affordable tool to test before trying medication

·         You struggle to focus during stressful conversations

·         You have mild to moderate anxiety (not severe)

# But here's what it won't do:

·         Replace professional mental health support

·         Cure clinical anxiety or panic disorder

·         Work if you don't actually use it

·         Fix deep-rooted trauma or serious stress

·         It's a tool. Not a cure.

·         Use it that way.

# The Bottom Line

·         An anxiety pen won't fix your life.

·         But it might give you one less thing to worry about.

·         It's cheap. It's simple. It works for a lot of people.

·         And if you're sitting here reading this, stressed out of your mind, scrolling through Reddit at 2 AM looking for solutions...

·         Maybe it's worth the $15 gamble.

·         Buy one. Use it for two weeks. See what happens.

·         The worst case? You spent $15 and learned something about yourself.

·         The best case? You found a simple tool that genuinely helps your anxiety.

·         I know which one I'd bet on.

·         Ready to Try an Anxiety Pen?

·         Stop reading about it.

·         Go grab one. Test it. See if it works.

·         Your stress isn't going anywhere.

·         But your anxiety pen can come along for the ride.

·         Get the best anxiety pen for your budget today. Your nervous system will thank you.

·         Because here's the truth: small tools create big changes.

·         And an anxiety pen is as small as they come.

# FAQ: Your Questions About Anxiety Pens, Answered

**Q: Will my co-workers think I'm weird for using an anxiety pen in the office?**

A: No. It looks like a regular pen. Most people don't notice. And if they do, they'll probably ask you where to get one.

**Q: How to find out the Quality Anxiety Pen**

Cheap pens use thin plastic. They break. Fast. Good pens use reinforced plastic or aluminium.

They last longer. They feel better in your hand.  Some pens click loud. Your co-workers will hate you.

Good ones have quiet mechanisms.

**Q: How long does an anxiety pen last before it breaks?**

A: A good quality pen lasts 1-2 years with normal use. Cheap ones break in 2-3 months. Spend the extra $5-10 for quality.

**Q: Can I actually use it to write, or is it just for fidgeting?**

A: Many anxiety pens are fidget-only. But some models let you write and fidget. Check the product description.",1,1771688485.0,u_Brief-Restaurant4589,0,1.0,False

We are sleeping together still, but making it super casual. Although, he said the other day that when he moves away in 6 months - 1 year, he wants me to come up and see him for the day, not just for sex but to hang out because he thinks it’ll be fun. He has said that he enjoys talking to me. 

He said that obviously our situation is complicated, I said how, it’s just sex, but he said when we have obviously there’s feelings involved. I didn’t respond to that. He said that his freedom is nice but he does get lonely. 

He wants to meet me for coffee soon so we can hang out as friends. Which will be nice. He said that it’s a shame because we get on so well, have great sex but we didn’t work out (due to his stress and stuff he has going on). He made a joke about what my mums reaction be if we got back together. He played a song in the car the other day that 2 days priorI said he used to sing about me, so i did think that was strange. 

I don’t know. I can’t tell if he still has feelings but is so stressed he can’t act on it so is hinting thing. Or he’s subconsciously being an arsehole because he can’t let go.

I told him i’m fine with how things are, but he can’t come to be for relationship stuff because i’m not going to give him the relationship side of me. He messaged me the other day asking if he was weird and was only wanted my opinion on it because ‘i know him better than he knows himself’",1,1771688277.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1rau38o,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1rau38o/i_saw_him/,I Saw Him,"I saw him more than once.  
  
In the morning, he sat alone with his coffee,  
staring into it as if it might answer him.  
He looked like someone carrying something invisible  
and unbearably heavy.  
There was a tear gathering  
just waiting its turn.

He hasn’t run out of tears.  
He’s just learned how to hold them  
until no one is watching.

I saw him again.

He walked the streets with his head lowered,  
hands buried in his pockets  
not to hold himself together  
but because he no longer knew what to do with them.  
He moved carefully,  
as if one wrong step might split something open inside him.

His face didn’t show rage.  
It showed absence.  
Like something essential had been removed  
and nothing had been put back.

I saw him again in the afternoon.  
He stood outside, smoking slowly,  
not because he wanted to  
but because it gave his hands something to do.

Grief needs occupation.

Grief has no memories attached to it.  
It’s made of plans.  
Of birthdays that never happened.  
Trips that stayed as browser tabs.  
Growing old in a house that was never built.

He didn’t deserve this.

He didn’t deserve this.  
He deserved to grow old beside her.  
To argue about small things.  
To laugh at nothing.  
To sit in a quiet room  
and let time pass safely.

Instead, he became  
the man whose wife died.

That title followed him  
long after the condolences stopped.

People think the worst part was the funeral.  
It wasn’t.

The worst part is an ordinary day  
three years later  
when nothing special happens  
and she is still not here.

I saw him one last time at night.  
The room was quiet.  
Too quiet.  
He covered his face  
and he just cried.

I’ll see him again tomorrow.  
I always do.

He lives in the mirror.

I am man whose wife died.

**Post:**

Hey fellow Reasoners,

I built a small batch LUFS checker for myself and thought I’d share it here in case it’s useful to anyone.

It’s a very simple local Windows tool. No installer, no cloud upload. You bounce your tracks as WAV/MP3/FLAC (or similar), then select them in the tool and analyze everything in one go.

What it does:

* Integrated LUFS (default –14 reference)
* True Peak (default –1 dBTP ceiling)
* Loudness Range (LRA)
* Sample rate detection
* Simple READY / ADJUST suggestion
* CSV + optional HTML report

That’s it. Not less, not more.

The idea is just to get a quick overview of multiple exported tracks before uploading them to Spotify or similar platforms. It helps you see which ones are roughly in range and which might need adjusting.

Under the hood it uses FFmpeg’s loudness analysis. I’ve tested the results against common online analyzers and LUFS VST plugins, and the values are consistent.

It’s not a mastering replacement. Just a practical overview tool for release prep.

Everything is fully open source on GitHub, so you can inspect the code if you want.

I usually hate overly complex and weird recipes, but I must say this one gives me the best and most consistent results with the coffees I have tried (Sey and some other light roasts). I do it with a melodrip instead of a spoon and the brews hit every time. It has the added benefit of the brew finishing at just the right temp for drinking right away. I personally hate waiting for coffee to cool. Just curious if others have tried this recipe and have similar or differing experiences.

I will be traveling to your fine country next month and just want to get a few tips on cultural differences that I may not be familiar with or aware of, to keep in mind when meeting new people. 

Obviously I would be in my best behavior but I would hate to do something that seems innocuous only to find out it's a huge faux pas.

I only found out earlier this month that I would be traveling to Finland, so I don't know the language, English is also my second language so I speak with an accent as it is. I understand most people speak English but it's it better to just stay quiet? 

I've done some research already but it's hard to get an idea of what to expect when there are so many opinions to read through.

I have wanted to visit Finland for a long time but I didn't think I'd get the opportunity for several more years so I'm having to cram a lot of research into a few short weeks. 

What is the coffee and tea culture like out there? Drinking culture? What's a good way to socialize, are there any card or drinking games I should learn? I know a few Mexican drinking games, would it be okay to introduce to a group of friends I just met? 

I don't want to come off to strong, the internet makes it seem like Finnish people are very reserved but maybe it's just everyone saying the same joke?

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**Tell us a bit about your Christian journey::**

Did not grow up going to church we went a few times but that’s where it kinda ends 

* But in my mid 20’s I actually would call myself a Christian I started reading the Bible got baptized.



 **What sort of person are you looking for?**

someone who is kind, patient , honest and can match my humor or at least tolerate mine 😜

 **Age range::**

  mid 20’s - 35 just somewhere around my age 



 **Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate**  

Long distance - YES  /   Relocate - possibly 



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 **Now the Long version / info dump**

*  I'M tryin to be as honest as I can be If that runs everyone away well so be it. Not tryin to paint a picture that I'm not  
*  now grab some coffee ,  yoo-hoo , or some Ovaltine  do they even still make thatt...? 





* My traits I would say are laid-back , try to see the good in a situation, playful, kind, a little dark humor.
* But to contrast that I’m also kinda dry and to the point especially if you don’t know me . I am not mean or at least not trying to be. 
*   Also I’m quiet always have been, not that I have some anxiety issue or something but if it’s a topic I don’t care much for or all that idol small talk I just don't talk all that much. That’s some of what I mean by dry , the more I’m around you the more I loosen up and the less noticeable it is.



 **me being Christian started in mid 20’s ( already said that ). Some life stuff happened happen and my story also , It involves other peoples privacy so it was a decision that I made and came to Christ . And… l will leave it at that.**



**Question 🙋‍♀️  u want to know alread**y!

*  When I was a kid I went to Baptist  church ( don’t member much , to little )and when I came to Christ that’s where I started back going to church n such got baptized 
*  Then Covid started and stopped going and never really went back 
*  That particular church went through a lot of changes after as well a lot of members left and new pastor , also attending no church this time .
*  at this current point I would consider myself non-denominational 
* do I read / listen to the bible enough not like I should 
*  what about study - I do, and enjoy it .I just don’t do enough my favorite is probably verse by verse, looking at cross references, chronological, and I like maps my favorite is probably Holman,  ESV , and logos maps. I would lit to also look at the Satellite Bible Atlas by: William Schlegel 



  **Side note 🗒️** 

  When differences flare up Bible/ Life whatever 

it’s important to work through it not to lock up 🔒 / communicate

keep a open mind 

* because it should be a 💯/ 💯 on both sides.
* Will I say stupid stuff. Oh yeah, but did I really need to write it ?😂

That’s why I try to keep a lighthearted attitude  towards things not that I’m not serious it’s just no sense in being sour , or a stick in the mud that’s difficult to talk to. 

I thought 💭 I would just get that out there





 **real talk**

  if i haven't lost everyone by now this might do it 



* I have a health issue and its Epilepsy , had it since child hood 

I'm cool about it make jokes whatever  I can’t do anything about , l just take my meds   

 I'm very fortunate that i haven't had to do any surgery's or anything  its been controlled with meds pretty well , as long as I don't Forget to Take them , but then theirs all ways that chance I might break out it the Harlem Shake 😅

  I also live with my folks  do to my Epilepsy , and honesty that has been hard for me to accept because I'm capable its more of a safety thing, the friends i used to have in school have moved or have families now.

* Ooowee 🤨I read that back and it sounded depressin as a mug , Its nowhere near that bad, but I already wrote it  though. 
* I love my parents and blessed to have them and we all help each other in different area's it kinda just works.



/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

**almost over,  lil recap**

* Look at my profile you find a little more info there if you haven’t already. 
* Am I the Most Christian person  Lawd NO I Listen to way to much messed up music , and don't read the bible enough for example. 
* as you can tell I’m not quite a hot mess but I’m not far from it 🫠😅 



*  A Committed relationship is very important to me I want to make this clear I've never been in relationship  "" oh that wasn't obvious  already... ""  and at this point I would rather save myself for marriage . \**that was really weird to write* 



* I'm willing to LDR with intent to accentual meet 
* and Relocating, as I said its possible I can talk all day about it, but talk's just that, Talk.
* when that moment comes to act well see .I know that's a crawfish answer , and not a hard Y/N most want.



**About u**



*  I’m not going to ask for anything I wouldn’t ask out of myself 
*  I’m not looking for some perfect person - that person came and gone...well u know what     I mean

I have a 5 year old Quaker parrot named Mango. Sweet bird. Loving bird. An absolute menace.

Back in June I was on a work call from home and I spilled an entire cup of coffee on my laptop. Without thinking I blurted out something along the lines of oh you have GOT to be kidding me in a pretty dramatic tone.

Mango thought this was the greatest thing he had ever heard in his entire life apparently.

He has now said this phrase at the following moments over the past six months:

When my mom called for the first time to meet him over video chat. When a plumber came to fix my sink and the apartment was completely silent. During a dinner party I hosted where nobody knew I had a bird. And just last week when I was on a date who I had over for the first time.

The timing is so specific that it genuinely feels intentional. Like he waits. He watches. He chooses his moment carefully.

What I cannot figure out is whether parrots actually understand context and timing or whether this is purely coincidence and my brain is connecting dots that are not there. Because the accuracy feels personal.

Does anyone else have a bird that seems to have a sixth sense for the most inconvenient possible moment to perform? How do you even untrain something that gets such an enthusiastic reaction every time? ",97,1771687322.0,Pets,27,0.98,False

1ratns3,https://www.reddit.com/r/homemaking/comments/1ratns3/how_to_not_feel_like_a_servant_when_being_a_home/,How to not feel like a servant when being a home maker,"Hi everyone, as says above I’m struggling with feeling more like a servant than a happy home maker. 

Allow me to give some context. My Partner Ken (obviously fake name) M28 and I F25 have been living together for nearly 3 years. When we started living together we started a house renovation. We both had full time jobs but quickly realised that one person needed to be working on the house full time. Ken has a tradesman’s job which helped out with the renovation, while I was working a retail job. We decided that I was to work on the house while Ken worked. We agreed that Ken would take care of all the payments (all house bills, materials, paying other trades, etc), while I in return worked on the house, cleaned and cooked. 

Fast forward to now. The house is very nearly finished. We live comfortably. Ken has had several pay rises at work and I have gotten myself a small part time job, working two days a week. Ken still takes care of all the bills and I still work on the house, clean and cook. 

However, I’ve started to notice a change in how Ken treats me a little. While we are in a loving relationship I find that he treats me more like a servant than a girlfriend. Kinda ordering me around and telling me it’s my job to do something. For example if we’re both home on a Saturday and I ask Ken for some help while tidying the kitchen he’ll tell me it’s my job and that he does enough already. He does very little towards cleaning and tidying. But god forbid there are used utensils by the kitchen sink awaiting to be put in the dishwasher, he’ll tell me that it makes the kitchen a fucking disaster. He describes small discrepancies like they’re personally insulting him to the highest degree. 

I understand that I’ve taken the role as homemaker and I’m very lucky to be in this position where I don’t have to worry about bills and such, but sometimes I feel like Ken uses it against me. He’ll tell me that no one else could offer me a life like this. I like making our home comfy and a safe place for us. We’ve spent so much time making it ours. But the lines are starting to feel blurred. I’ve tried talking to Ken about this before but he starts going on about how much he works and how little he asks for. In truth he goes to work and comes back and does nothing, not that I expect him to. But he immediately starts asking about dinner, won’t really make an effort to talk to me, ask for coffee and his towel for a shower. Just like I’m a servant. 

It makes me feel awful. He’s given me this space of comfort and in return I’ve just given him the finger. Am I just blind? Am I complaining for no reason? I do still cook and clean and make our house a home, but I’m also human. I forget things sometimes and also get tired out. 

I don’t want to feel like a trapped servant who sleeps in her masters bed… I’m looking for some advice as I like caring about the things that make a house a home…",22,1771687109.0,homemaking,30,0.84,False

Once upon a time I was silly enough to suggest that cycle lanes just lead to gentrification . I was shot down in flames by cycle lane advocates . They produced papers and studies proving that there was no link between gentrification and cycle lanes .  
I thought that it seemed an awful lot of effort was put into proving something most people never consider .  
Rents and house prices in Govanhill have always risen . Just a coincidence that there is a cycle lane there now .  
Now you all know that the city wants to cut car usage by 30% and that £470 M  is being spent on the city network with a completion date set for 2031 .  
The screenshots come from he delivery plan [City Network Delivery Plan](https://citizen.glascc1-prd.gosshosted.com/media/5895/City-Network-Delivery-Plan/pdf/City_Network_Final_Delivery_Plan.pdf?m=638242454912770000)  
Now since they embarked upon this project funding has been changed . Previously they  could apply for funding for multi year projects like what they did with the avenues . That is not the case now . Presently they can only bid for projects that can be completed within a year . So it will be a wee bit of lanes built , apply for next bit build it , apply for next bit and so on .  
You can see from the delivery plan that the greatest spend will be in the latter stages and will develop the network to the housing schemes .

But what say there is some problem with getting the funding in coming years ? We are on phase 1 just now and the majority of spending comes at the end .  
Could it be possible that after connecting the west end to the Southern General and extended it to the East end that it will go no further ?  
I looked at this because of the problems with Pollokshaws Roundabout which I have mentioned in a previous post , it will be 2029 before any safety measures are implemented there .

They are not building a fifteen minute city they are taking over the city centre . It is being developed for those coming to stay here , not for those that live here already .

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration looks simple at first glance.

But in real use, it quietly removes friction you didn’t realize was slowing you down.

The best upgrades often work like that.



# Why OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration Removes Daily Friction

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration eliminates the constant need to check dashboards.

Every time you stop what you’re doing to open a device, you lose momentum.

Your flow stays intact.

Your attention stays clean.

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration reduces overhead without adding new steps.

That alone makes your day smoother.



# How OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration Speeds Up Your Reaction Time

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration matters because timing matters.

When something breaks, you want to know now, not thirty minutes later.

Automation workflows fail.

API keys expire.

Tasks stall.

Devices disconnect.

These things happen when you least expect them.

If you don’t catch the issue fast, you lose output.

This update prevents that loss.

You get an alert instantly.

The watch makes that awareness instant.

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration works because the entire system became easier to supervise.



# How OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration Supports People Running Automations Everywhere

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration helps anyone who uses automation as part of their daily workflow.

Automation is supposed to save time.

But it only saves time when the system tells you what matters and hides what doesn’t.

You know what finished.

You know what failed.

You know what needs attention.

You know what can be ignored.

All without sitting in front of a screen.

It gives you filtered awareness.

It’s about reducing the cost of being away for a moment.

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration gives you peace of mind without trapping you at your desk.



# Why OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration Matters For Real-World Productivity

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration fits how people work today.

We move around constantly.

A quick wrist check is easier than unlocking a phone.

Easier than opening a laptop.

Easier than refreshing a dashboard.

This simplicity makes the system feel more natural.

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration pushes automation toward everyday usability instead of specialized workflows.

Traces became more accurate.

Metrics became more meaningful.

Debugging becomes faster.

You spend less time searching for problems and more time solving them.

Plugin hardening matters too.

Many internal tools rely on plugins to connect different parts of the stack.

A single weak plugin can break everything.

Now that risk is lower.

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration may look like a simple UI update, but the backend improvements are just as meaningful.

Developers feel that impact immediately.



# Why OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration Helps You Stay Organized

OpenClaw Apple Watch Integration works well because it discourages chaos.

People forget to update software.

People skip patches.

People delay maintenance.

That leads to breakage.

1ratk5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1ratk5j/the_quickest_way_to_make_anyone_laugh/,The Quickest Way To Make ANYONE Laugh: psychology-backed tricks that actually work,"Look, I spent way too much time studying why some people are naturally funny while others bomb every joke. Not because I'm some comedy nerd, but because I noticed something wild: the funniest people in any room aren't necessarily the smartest or most attractive. They just get something the rest of us don't. After diving deep into comedy theory, psychology research, and dissecting what actually makes people laugh (yeah, I watched hundreds of hours of standup breakdowns and read studies on humor), I cracked the code. And no, it's not about memorizing jokes or being naturally charismatic. It's way simpler than that.



 Step 1: Stop Trying So Hard (Seriously)



Here's what kills most attempts at humor: desperation. When you're actively trying to make someone laugh, they can smell it from a mile away. Your energy shifts, you get tense, and suddenly everything feels forced. 



The secret? Comedy lives in relaxation. Think about the funniest people you know. They're not performing. They're just existing and pointing out absurd shit they notice. 



Research from the University of California actually shows that anxiety reduces your ability to be funny by about 60%. Your brain goes into threat mode and loses access to creative thinking. So rule number one: chill the fuck out.



 Step 2: Master The Rule of Three



This is actual comedy science. Our brains are wired to expect patterns. When you set up two things, we anticipate a third that follows the pattern. The laugh comes when you break it.



Example: ""I like my coffee like I like my mornings: dark, bitter, and impossible to enjoy."" 



See what happened there? First two set the pattern (typical ""I like my X like my Y"" joke), third one twists it. Comedians use this constantly because it works on a neurological level.



The Humor Code by Peter McGraw and Joel Warner breaks this down beautifully. McGraw's a behavioral scientist who literally created a mathematical formula for humor (called benign violation theory). The book is insanely good at explaining why certain things are funny while others fall flat. This will change how you see comedy forever, not kidding.



 Step 3: Embrace The Awkward Pause



Most people panic during silence. They rush to fill it, kill the joke's momentum, explain the punchline. Wrong move.



The pause is where the laugh lives. After you deliver something potentially funny, shut up. Let it breathe. Give people's brains time to catch up, process the twist, and react naturally.



Watch any great comedian. They're masters of timing, which really just means they're comfortable with silence. That 1-2 second pause after a punchline? That's not accident, it's technique.



 Step 4: Laugh At Yourself First



Nothing disarms people faster than self-deprecating humor done right. Notice I said ""done right"" because there's a massive difference between funny self-awareness and depressing self-hatred.



Good self-deprecation: ""I'm at that age where my back goes out more than I do.""



Bad self-deprecation: ""I'm such a worthless piece of shit, right? Haha...""



The difference? Good self-deprecation is specific, absurd, and confident. You're not actually putting yourself down, you're observing something ridiculous about the human experience through your own lens.



 Step 5: Build Your Humor Database



Here's something nobody tells you: funny people aren't born funny. They've just consumed massive amounts of comedy and trained their brains to spot patterns.



Start actively studying humor. Not in some boring academic way, but just pay attention to what makes you laugh and why.



Watch ""How to Be Funny"" on Charisma on Command's YouTube channel. Charlie breaks down exactly what makes comedians like John Mulaney, Dave Chappelle, and Ali Wong so damn funny, frame by frame. You start seeing the mechanics behind jokes you thought were just ""natural"" talent. Binge the whole series.



Also grab The Comedy Bible by Judy Carter. Yeah, the title sounds cheesy, but Carter's been teaching comedy writing for 30 years. The book is packed with actual exercises that train your brain to think funny. It's not theory, it's practice. Do the exercises, even if they feel stupid. They work.



If you want a more structured approach to building social skills beyond just humor, BeFreed is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered learning app that creates personalized audio lessons and adaptive learning plans based on your specific goals, like ""become funnier as an introvert"" or ""master witty comebacks in conversations."" 



The app pulls from comedy books, communication experts, and psychology research to build content that fits your learning style. You can customize everything from lesson length (10-minute quick takes or 40-minute deep dives with examples) to the narrator's voice. There's even a virtual coach called Freedia you can chat with about your specific struggles, like bombing jokes at work or overthinking your delivery. It adjusts as you progress, making the whole process feel less like studying and more like having a smart friend guide you through it.



 Step 6: Read The Room Like Your Life Depends On It



This is where most people fuck up. They have one style of humor and force it everywhere. That's not how this works.



Different contexts need different approaches:



\- Work setting: Observational humor about shared experiences works best. Stay away from anything that could offend.

\- Close friends: This is where you can push boundaries and get weird.

\- New people: Self-deprecating humor builds trust fastest.



The key is calibration. You're constantly reading micro-expressions, energy levels, and group dynamics. Is everyone tired? Don't force high energy comedy. Is someone clearly stressed? Maybe now's not the time for sarcasm.



This isn't manipulation, it's empathy. You're adjusting your approach based on what people need in that moment.



 Step 7: Exaggeration Is Your Best Friend



Reality is boring. Comedy lives in exaggeration. Take any observation and blow it up to absurd proportions.



Normal observation: ""Traffic was bad today.""



Funny observation: ""Traffic was so bad, I aged seven years sitting in my car. I got in as a young man and arrived with a mortgage and two kids I don't remember having.""



You're not lying, you're amplifying the feeling everyone relates to. That's the sweet spot.



 Step 8: Use Callbacks Like A Pro



This is advanced level shit but it's what separates amateur funny from professional funny. A callback is when you reference something funny from earlier in the conversation.



It works because:

1. It shows you were actually listening

2. It creates an inside joke in real time

3. It builds comedic momentum



Let's say someone joked earlier about being terrible at cooking. Two hours later, when they suggest dinner plans, you say: ""Oh, are you cooking? Should I bring my own fire extinguisher or are you providing those?""



Boom. Instant laugh because you're connecting moments and showing social awareness.



 Step 9: Study Body Language, Not Just Words



Here's something wild: studies show that only 30% of humor comes from the actual words you say. The rest is delivery, timing, facial expressions, and body language.



You can say the same joke with different energy and get completely different results. Try this: say ""I'm fine"" in five different ways (sarcastic, deadpan, enthusiastic, confused, angry). Each version creates different comedy.



Start using the Insight Timer app (it's free) and look up their comedy meditation series. Sounds weird but there are actual exercises for loosening up physically, which makes your humor delivery more natural. Ten minutes a day and you'll notice your whole energy shifts.



 Step 10: Embrace Weird Specificity



Generic humor is forgettable. Specific, weird observations stick.



Instead of: ""I'm tired.""



Try: ""I'm so tired, I just tried to unlock my apartment with my car key fob and got genuinely confused when the door didn't beep.""



The specificity makes it visual and relatable but unique enough to be interesting. This is what makes people go ""Oh my god, YES"" because you're articulating something they've felt but never expressed.



 The Real Secret Nobody Talks About



Here's the thing I learned after all this research: funny people aren't trying to make you laugh. They're trying to connect with you through shared absurdity. The laugh is just proof the connection worked.



Stop seeing humor as performance. Start seeing it as translation. You're taking the weird, frustrating, ridiculous parts of being human and translating them into something sharable. When someone laughs, they're saying ""I see you, I've been there, I get it.""



That's way more powerful than just being the funny guy at parties. That's actual connection disguised as comedy.

Throwaway bc my wife knows my main acc.

So I (M27) and my wife (F26) have 2 daughters (3yo + baby almost 1). Two years ago my parents died. They left behind a house + business, and in their will they basically said whoever takes care of the younger kids gets the house. My older siblings bailed, so I stepped up. That means I became guardian of my 3 younger sisters (Corrine 15, Summer 11, Aoi 16).

At first my wife agreed. But now she’s breaking down. She says she doesn’t feel like a person anymore, just “mom.” She wakes up at 6am, drives Corrine bc she can’t bus, takes the babies along bc she can’t leave them, breaks up Aoi + Corrine fights over the bathroom, gets called witch/bitch, deals w Summer’s meltdowns in the car, therapy appts w babies in tow, Corrine doesn’t help, Aoi is always out. She says she only gets like 2 hrs a day w our daughters.

She cried when I asked about my birthday bc even planning a dinner was too much: Aoi vegan, Corrine allergies, Summer food texture issues, babies can’t eat certain stuff. She said just thinking abt it made her cry.

I love my wife, don’t want divorce. But I can’t work less bc I’m running my dad’s biz. My siblings won’t help except Helena (sends money but lives far). No daycare nearby. My aunts said it’s my parents’ fault for having too many kids. I cut them off.

So now my wife is exhausted, crying, saying she doesn’t know who she is anymore. I feel guilty bc I basically dumped all this on her. But also… these are my sisters, I couldn’t just abandon them.

AITA for putting my wife in this position?

We all have tiny separate rooms but share one kitchen and one bathroom. When I moved in, the only rules were basic: clean up after yourself, no loud parties, no random strangers. No curfew. No official quiet hours. Nothing.

Here’s the thing, I’m a full time student with morning classes usually 8am–12nn, and I also work remotely for a US-based company from 9pm–6am. Yes, it’s exhausting. Yes, I’m barely surviving. But I need both because I pay my own tuition and rent.

My routine looks like this:

– 6:30am quick shower after my shift

– 8am–12nn classes

– Afternoon is usually sleep

– 8–9pm dinner before work

– 1–2am quick coffee or reheated meal during break

I’m not blasting music. I don’t watch TV outside. I don’t invite friends over. The noise is literally microwave beeps, light dishwashing, and normal shower sounds.

Last week, I walked into what felt like a full-on intervention. All three of them were sitting in the living area waiting for me. They told me I’ve been disruptive and self-centered. Apparently, they all agreed among themselves that from 10pm to 6am is strict quiet time because they have 8am classes.

No one told me about this rule. They just… decided it. Without me.

They said my microwave wakes them up, that my footsteps are too loud at night, and that showering at 6:30am echoes through the pipes. One of them literally said it feels like they’re living in a dorm with no discipline.

I apologized for disturbing their sleep, because I get it. But I also explained that I work nights and study in the morning. I’m not partying. I’m not being careless. I’m trying to survive. I offered compromises meal prep earlier, mute the microwave, shower even faster, tiptoe like a ninja. They said it’s still inconsiderate and that I should adjust my lifestyle for the majority.

Adjust my lifestyle. Meaning what? Quit my job? Stop studying? Starve quietly until sunrise?

Now it’s cold and tense. They stop talking when I enter the room. Someone taped a printed sign on the fridge that says “Respect QUIET HOURS.” The word quiet is in bold and highlighted. The landlady even texted me saying she’s heard concerns about nighttime disturbances.

I feel like I’m being villainized for literally juggling school and a job. But at the same time, I know sleep is important and I don’t want to be the roommate everyone resents.

Professional lurker here. I got inspired [by this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o37x7v/my_humble_coffee_station_is_ready) by u/Pepeluis33 that a complete viable espresso setup should possible for less than 300€ (also [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lpqdhk/a_small_guide_for_improving_basic_manual_espresso) by u/191x7). I ordered essentially the same equipment (save the grinder and scale) and today after about 60 failed shots over the last two days, I finally got a decent shot out of it (picture of a latte to show off my ""art""). 

First shot I choked the machine (I thought the mantra is grind finer right?), went slowly back up to more than a turbo and back down, cause I kept confusing sour and bitter and going in the wrong direction. But I learned a lot. So thank you all for this trove of information. Let's see how deep this rabbit hole gets.

I don't think you can start much cheaper.

Some notes: I used the ""coin trick"" to find a good dose and went up to 10.5g for the single and currently 21g for the double, otherwise the pucks would stay very soupy. I guess the baskets are a bit on the larger side. [Don't buy this scale, it rounds to full 10g steps making it rather inaccurate](https://alishort.com/v7Keh) and frustrating to get the right dose..

1rate2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/1rate2a/just_got_the_diagnosis_this_week/,Just got the diagnosis this week,"New account to focus just on the new journey I find myself on.

Background:   
\-age 49  
\-PSA of 3.1 in December  
\-Gleason 3+3, 4% of 1 of 12 cores(although looks like only 6 were testable), grade group score of 1.   
\-getting the genetic test done   
\-follow up appointment in April   
\-Was on TRT for 7 months, stopped that immediately  
\-Currently doing intermittent fasting 20:4 during the week for weight lose. Was at 250 in August, currently at 230. My first goal is 199. Will set a new goal (maybe 175?) when I get there.  
\-Started doing real research today. Using: r/ProstateCancer (obviously),  [https://aspatients.org/](https://aspatients.org/) (found in this sub, thank you!) and [Urologyhealth.org](http://Urologyhealth.org) (recommended by my doctor)

  
Rant:  
WTF, age 49! I know I'm not going to live forever, my family has a long history of heart disease and breast cancer. I didn't see this coming. 

  
The doctor went over the three main options (AS, radiation and RALP \[still learning the acronyms\]). Recommended AS as of now, I agreed with this at the time.   
She went over a lot and I didn't retain as much as I would have liked, I see why they do a follow up so soon.   


My questions for the follow up appt:  
\-What will the frequency of the PSA tests be?   
\-What will the frequency of the MRIs be?  
\-What will the frequency of the biopsys be?  
\-Besides lose weight, what if anything can I do to improve my situation?  
\-Is there any exercises I should do or avoid? (this seems like a dumb question, but you don't know what you don't know)  
\-Are there any prescriptions or OTC supplements I should start?  
\-Is there any foods I should avoid or try to eat more of?  
\-Can we create a written schedule (subject to change)? I'm very much a visual person over audio. I tell my wife all the time, show me something and I'll retain that information forever, tell me something and I'll forget it by the next sentence. LOL, an exaggeration, but not by much. The doctor went over some of my previous questions, but I didn't retain the exact details.  
\-Does coffee impact prostate cancer at all? (I LOVE coffee)  
\-Does alcohol have any impact positive or negative on prostate cancer? (On the weekends, I  enjoy pairing a fine wine with our home made dinners. Yes, I know, alcohol in general doesn't have a positive impact on your health. I consider the ""positive"" impact to be the keeping to the things I enjoy and not giving up the routine.)

  
Questions to the sub:  
\-What obvious questions am I missing for the April follow up?  
\-Do I need a second opinion? AS seems wholly appropriate here to me. 4% of 1 of 12 cores seems like it's the smallest possible finding that could result with the sentence ""you have cancer."" The only inappropriate action would be to bury my head in the ground and ignore it.   
\-Besides lose weight, what if anything can I do to improve my situation?

They think it's chemistry, timing, or some unrealistic spark. But the truth? Love follows patterns. And most people selfsabotage because they never learn how relationships actually work. 

This post is for anyone who's tired of being just a friend, ghosted, or stuck in short term flings. It's packed with tips backed by science, books, and actual psychologists stuff that actually works, not TikTok pickup advice. No fluff, no BS. Just the real playbook.

1. Trigger emotional safety, not excitement.  
In Attached by Amir Levine, it’s clear: secure partners win longterm, not the unpredictable ones. You don’t need to be hot or rich to win someone’s heart. You need to be consistent. If someone feels safe, validated, and understood around you, attraction builds over time. Harvard psychologist Dr. Sue Johnson also found that emotional responsiveness is the #1 factor in longterm romantic bonding.

2. Master the mirroring effect.  
People fall for those who feel familiar. A 1999 study from New York University led by Tanya Chartrand found that subtle mimicry increases likability and emotional bonding. You don't copy them in a creepy way, but matching tone, posture, or even pace of conversation builds subconscious comfort.

3. Be interested, not just interesting.  
Dale Carnegie’s classic How to Win Friends and Influence People still holds up. People care more about how you make them feel. Ask thoughtful questions. Listen without waiting to talk. A 2020 UC Berkeley study showed that people rate good listeners as significantly more attractive than average-looking conversationalists.

4. Use vulnerability hooks.  
Dr. Arthur Aron’s famous 36 questions that lead to love is based on creating closeness through shared vulnerability. You don’t traumadump. But when you open up just a bit past surface level, it invites the other person to do the same. Emotional intimacy follows.

5. Invoke the pratfall effect.  
Being too perfect is boring. A study from Elliot Aronson (yes, another Aron, 1966) showed people found someone more attractive after they made a small mistake like spilling coffee because it made them more human. Authenticity is sexier than perfection.

6. Be less available, not unavailable.  
Scarcity increases value but disappearing completely makes you forgettable. The trick is controlled availability. Behavioral economist Dan Ariely found that intermittent reinforcement (think unpredictable rewards) increases desire. You don’t ignore them. You just don’t always say yes. That balance is powerful.

7. Invest AFTER they’ve invested.  
Psychologist Robert Cialdini’s research on reciprocity shows we value what we work for. Don’t overgive too early. Let things build. Small shared goals or inside jokes strengthen bonds because both sides feel part of something earned, not given.

Real love isn’t luck. It’s patterns. Play the long game, build safety, stay a little mysterious, and watch how people start leaning in.

“And they want you to head it?”

“I think they just want me to learn it? They say a lot of the Kafya here on the base have been feeling… oh how did the Human put it…”

“Lost.” Rhidi said gently, and when Lirya looked around to the yellow furred Kafya, she was staring out at the base. “I have been hearing rumblings of the same feeling, as not many of the Kafya have been getting pulled towards the Human religions.”

“Yeah…” Lirya replied quietly, looking back up at the Human moon.

Silence passed between them for a few minutes, and Rhidi broke the quiet.

“We’re all a bit lost here, you know.” Rhidi began, pulling a can of cola from her pocket and cracking it open. “We’re all *Kuwai* here now, and despite belonging and finding a home here in the UAA, there is very little to remind the softer Kafya of home. I left because I frankly hated our race and wanted to continue being a soldier, but the others came here to try and outrun the Elder Councils and whatever else was going on on their planet.”

Rhidi took a long pull from her can of cola, then stretched her arms out along the back of the bench.

When Lirya didn’t say anything, Rhidi looked back over at the white fur.

“You going to take it?”

“Take what?” Lirya asked. “The job?”

“Yeah!”

“... I’m thinking I might.”

“Don’t see why you wouldn’t.” Rhidi replied, taking another drink from her can and smacking her lips. “You white furs have been killed by the millions and abused for who knows how long, and my dad hated how your color was treated. You’re way different than the one I met earlier by the way, and I apologize for my shortness with you on our first meeting.”

“It’s okay!” Lirya said chirpily, waving a hand at Rhidi. “It’s no problem! It’s not even close to what I had to deal with back home, so…”

The silence came across them again, and this time it was Lirya that broke the quiet.

“Do you think the Kafyan soldiers will like me?”

Rhidi barked out a laugh. “Oh I’m sure they’ll be pretty frosty at first! But you’re a friendly sort. It won’t last for long.”

“I don’t really know what to do though.”

“Ask the Humans, they know a lot of stuff and can probably point you in the right direction.”

“I mean… they’re asking me to bring back our old religion, and it’s been dead for… for…”

“Thousands of years, if you listen to my dad.”

“I like Kohan.”

“Yeah, his wife is a bit of a bitch though.”

Lirya let out a loud, happy giggle, Rhidi chuckling beside her as she finished off her can of cola.

“What I’ve found, though,” Rhidi continued on, setting the empty can down on the bench beside her, “Is that I’ve enjoyed being able to forge my own life here on this planet. On Earth, the Elder Councils and all their stupid fucking rules can’t get to you. You can do or be whatever you want down here, and you need to embrace that.”

Lirya leaned forward, watching Rhidi as she spoke, then pointed at Rhidi’s legs. “Can I get as big of muscles as you?”

“You can try.” Rhidi chuckled out, extending her legs and flexing them. “You may go bankrupt trying to feed yourself though. I eat damn near… five times a day, work out every day, it can get pretty intense.”

Lirya looked down at her own, skinny legs, then at her skinny arms… and gave them all a wiggle. “Can I get… a little bit bigger?”

“I don’t see why not.” Rhidi replied airily. “There’s a fellow that runs the gym on this base, helps all the civilians stay in shape. His name is Mitch… or Michael… something of that sort. If you take the job with the Humans, they can introduce you.”

“I don’t have to eat five times a day though, right?” Lirya asked, her stomach already feeling queasy at the thought. “I can barely manage three times a day, let alone five…”

Rhidi let out a low, chuffing laugh, then stood up, gathering her trash for when she found a garbage can.

Rhidi looked off towards the base again, then back at Lirya, smiling. “You ought to stay awhile. Take the job, try it on, and see how it feels. You may find the freedom… rather *difficult* to give up.”

Rhidi began to walk away, then tossed a comment over her shoulder as she waved goodbye to Lirya. “Or worth *killing* for…”

Lirya blinked at the words as she waved goodbye; She didn’t think she would be able to kill… but maybe she had it in her to try and breathe life back into whatever aspects of the old ways that she could.

She sat there considering the thought all the way into the morning, her black eyes burning with the red fire of the rising sun as she stood, brushing off her pants and tunic. Lirya reached up towards the sky, stretching out her back muscles with little pops and cracks, then shook herself a few times before smacking her lips.

“I’m thirsty.” Lirya said flatly to herself, then took off with a long stride towards the nearest cafe.

When she arrived at the little coffee place near the drop zone, only the early rising NCOs and Officers were there. They gave her an odd look or two, mostly towards her boots, but Lirya walked out of the shop with a warm latte only a few minutes later, the smell of vanilla curling in her nose and waking up her mind.

Lirya slowly sipped her coffee as she walked down the sidewalk, gradually picking up her step as her mind began to coalesce around the same, thrumming thought.

She was *taking* that job.

She was going to make something *more* of herself, more than just some space station charity case, or a little wasteling that picks and plucks through the trash for recycling.

She was going to be someone her parents could be *proud* of.

Before she knew it, Lirya was quick stepping along the sidewalk, stretching out her stride.

The base came alive around her as Lirya found a new spark in herself, the barracks beginning to rumble with sound and movement as she continued her pace down along the side of the road.

Reveille played out across the base as the flags were hoisted, cannons were fired, and Lirya began to pick up her speed into a jog.

Her coffee cup was empty in her clutching hand as she passed by formations of soldiers getting together for PT, with many Kafya turning their heads to watch her go.

By the time the church loomed into view, Lirya was at a dead, panting sprint, empty coffee cup in hand as she pulled air into her lungs with exhilarated inhales. 

She had never felt this *alive* in all her life, and she crashed into the doors with the full weight of her body.

The doors slammed open as Lirya came stumbling through them, her paw boots thudding awkwardly on the polished floors as she careened into the grand hallway.

She would have fallen flat on her face… if it hadn’t been for Mohki.

“Fuck’s sakes, Lirya!” Mohki laughed, catching the white fur before her nose could impact the tiles, and pulling her back onto her feet. “Where have you been?! The ship crew said you were seen leaving at like, two in the morning!”

Lirya, panting and trying to catch her breath, hugged her friend close, laughing airily as she regained her footing. “I… was… thinking!”

“You couldn’t think on the damn ship?” Mohki asked, patting Lirya down and straightening her blouse so it was no longer crooked. “What did you do, just walk around the base all night?”

“Kinda, yeah!” Lirya panted out, then hugged Mohki with another breathy giggle. “I met Rhidi again!”

Mohki narrowed her eyebrows at this, patting Lirya on the back before holding her out by the shoulders. “Was she nice? She didn’t say anything mean did she?”

“No! No, no.” Lirya said, smoothing back her messy hair. “She… actually helped me realize a few things, and put some other things in perspective.”

Mohki breathed out. “Oh, good. I was going to play tough and all that, but we both know she would probably use my skull as a bowling ball…”

A door opened near the back of the church, and a sleepy looking Lawrence stepped out, coffee cup in hand as he investigated all the noise.

When he saw Lirya, he smiled. “Oh, well good morning Lirya. I didn’t think I would see you until later this evening.”

“Good morning Lawrence!” Lirya called out, taking Mohki by the hand and walking towards the man. “You look sleepy!”

“Saska tends to sno-” Lawrence began to say, then coughed and took a quick sip of his coffee before gesturing with his mug. “I was up late reading some of the data cache that was brought in. We managed to make a nice dossier for you while we look at the rest of it.”

Mohki, having heard that first little bit, chose to ignore it while being dragged by Lirya. “Data cache?”

“Yes, brought in by one of our ships. It was found by some friendly-aligned fellows of the stars and given over to the UAA for a finder’s fee.” Lawrence mused, taking another sip of coffee as Lirya came before him with a proud bounce of her heels. He smiled at her, setting down his cup on a nearby side table and placing his hands on his hips. “So, Lirya. I take it you have come to a decision?”

Lirya nodded rapidly, pulling Mohki up beside her with a soft tug. “I have! And… and I want to do it! I want to try, at least. Are you sure I can hire Mohki? She works up on station and her job quite likes her.”

“Lirya-” Mohki began, but Lawrence held up his hand.

“We can work with the station and help pay off any debts or buyout contracts, that is not an issue for us.” Lawrence said, his eyes narrowing ever so slightly as he looked at Mohki. “We believe it would be beneficial for Lirya to have you at her side.”

“What if I don’t want to do that?” Mohki quipped, annoyed despite Lirya bouncing up and down in her hands.

Lawrence let out a small yawn, then rolled a shoulder. “You can choose your own uniform, the UAA supplies a pistol, rifle, ammunition, and other gear you may desire. Plus a solid rate of pay.”

“Probably not solid enough.” Mohki growled. “I made *good money* on station.”

Lawrence reached inside his clothing, pulled out a data slate, tapped it, then held it out towards Mohki so only she could see.

When Mohki read the number, her eyebrows slowly climbed on her face as she read along.

“... I can uh… be persuaded.” Mohki muttered, which did nothing but make Lirya cackle happily while stomping her feet.

The front doors opened again, all three of them turning to see Saska walking in with a pair of coffees in her hand.

“Oi, Lawrence! I wanted to apologize for biting-” Saska began, then froze with wide, embarrassed yellow eyes as she saw Lirya and Mohki standing there. Her face turned from shocked confusion to a wolfish grin, and she very carefully pumped her coffee cup laden fist. “Oh *fuck* yeah!”

Lawrence grimaced at such language being used in the main, public area of his church, though Mohki nudged him in the ribs as Lirya went off to meet Saska, the two hugging each other with loud laughs.

“I see why you like her.” Mohki mused, crossing her arms.

Lawrence gave a wry chuckle, folding his arms as well. “Her energy gives me mine. Would you prefer a submachine gun or a rifle?”

“Sub gun would do me fine.” Mohki said with a smile, Lirya looking over her shoulder at her with the widest smile she had ever seen the white fur produce. “Something tells me I’ll be working in tight spaces here soon, and up close.”",9,1771685781.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1rat3ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Midnight_Society/comments/1rat3ig/headhunter_ii/,Headhunter II,"The sorcerer had a funny thought, as he gazed down on all of the neon squalor glow of the Fallen Angel City below him from the rooftops edge.  

The Nazis were right. You are a degenerate species…

It was all of it a swollen pustule sac. A land of green milk and curdled cheese, cockroaches swam in the stew of discharge and mire and laughably called it a metropolitan. A cultural hub. 

A blade of a smile formed amongst a tumult of dark and ageless hair, a wizard's haggard beard. Blasted by sand and sun just like the rest of the white robed man. White robed death. 

Some say he is the mad author of the Necronomicon. He has authored the destruction of countless cities, countless places… before this one. 

Jericho. Troy. Münster. Constantinople. Alexandria. Roanoke. Ikeshima. Rome. 

And many others… great and small. He doesn't care. He only loved to watch as the red hand of Iblis crawled across the blackening surface of all things dying in its embrace, turning the whole of the world into its killing floor. 

But that wasn't all with this place. No. He was sent here not just to burn but to gather intelligence for the order. 

And to contest. 

…

Homicide was scrambling. They had nothing. What commonalities they did find between the victims was interesting… but it only led to more bafflement. More flummoxed minds in the busying police departments all across the city. All bullshit pretension had been dropped, all departments across all counties and neighborhoods were working together on this one, to bring the crazy fucking bastard in. 

But still they had nothing. Except that he liked to chop off heads. And leave them at churches for some fucking reason. 

And one other thing. One oddity that more than a few of the sharper minds amongst the rank and file of criminal investigators found to be interesting. 

But did it mean anything? 

All of them. Every head found belonged to someone with a rap sheet that read more like a tome. Miles long some of em. Each and every one of em had a history. 

Mob hits! that was the popular running theory around the suits and their steaming white paper cups of coffee. 

It wasn't a bad one, most thought. 

Could be. Could be.

…

Azræl leapt from the dark and charged into the man as he was making his way to his car. Slamming him into the driver's door as he tried to open it and catching him by surprise. 

This was the one. This was one of the faces the goat-shape demanded be brought before her feet. 

His hand, clenched tightly round the hilt of his great sword came up and bashed the maggot across the mouth with the metal pommel of the weapon. A crack, and a splurt of hot blood and teeth out the mouth and the maggot went down to his knees, mewling. 

Where he belonged. 

The maggot struggled to speak and beg as the headhunter raised his great blade above his head. Readying to strike. 

“Not at all for you or yourself. Swear to her. Pray to me.” said Azræl as he brought the blade down and cleaved the head free from the rest of the meat. It tumble-jumped with a ropey-cord tail of thick black red that the stump continued to produce and shoot in dark gouts for a moment before the headless body collapsed to the street. 

And then the night was quiet again. All around.  Lights buzzed and mock heaven glowed. 

The peace was relative, conditionary. You could still hear the ghost song of sirens in the distance. Wailing away in flight, in search, in search of anything. 

Azræl picked up the head and said his prayers to the goat-shaped lord of his house and order. He tied it to the belt of his hulking black leather visage to join two others and went on his way. 

The sorcerer watched. The sorcerer was impressed. 

…

He heaved. Spewed. Decorated the sidewalk and gutter in more bile, blood and stomach lining as another sharp stab in his stomach racked his guts and his convulsion threatened to roll over into a seizing tear in his brain. 

Homeless and well past his last leg, Elton prayed for death as his sickened body worsened on the pavement, alone at the bus stop. Underneath the flickering glow of a dying bulb, a failing light. 

It was not death he received but something more spectacular. Elton, Grabby to his friends and scum and fellow urchins of the street, was made audience and thus unwitting chronicler to a chapter in a shadow conflict centuries upon centuries old, perhaps the oldest conflict in all of man's time. Perhaps even older than that. 

Grabby/Elton looked up from his own bloody spew of booze and lining and watched a giant titan walk into view. Destroying his solitude on this witching houred boulevard. 

He knew he must be fucked. The guy looked massive and he looked like Mad Max or the Terminator or someone like that and he looked like he was carrying a huge fucking sword. 

And along his belt were a buncha fuckin heads…

No fucking way. The dying urchin refused it. No fuckin way am I actually seein that fuckin thing. 

But real or not, the giant of myth and flesh and chained leather continued to march up and then past the druggie’s view, crossing to and then down the opposite side of the street. 

But then something made the headhunter stop. 

Elton heard it too. 

A note.  Notes. Music. 

A wind pattern series flurry of intricate and delicate notes whispered and alternate sharp-stab blasted through the nighttime witching air. Filling it. Dominating the scene. 

Azræl tensed cat-like coiled as his hair stood on end. The music was flute-like. Middle Eastern flavored…

Goddamit. No.

The headhunter was filled with dread. 

The music stopped. An ancient voice, bold, cut through the night. 

“How are you, German? Been long time."" 

His stance shifted to battle ready as his blade came up raised. His voice, louder, cut through the night as well to the speaker unseen. But he knew who it was to whom he spoke. 

""What do you want, snake?”

Laughter. Real. The knight Azræl always was good for a laugh as far the sorcerer was concerned.

“So funny?"" Azræl said to the night all around him. “Come out and show me what's so funny, witch."" 

More laughter. 

“Have we not shared many things over the long years, my friend? Such a long time. A great deal.”

A series of images flicker-shot through the headhunter's mind then. Whether put there by the devilry of the sorcerer or memories of his own from one of many possible past lives, Azræl was not sure. If he lived through this encounter he would meditate and pray on the matter later. 

If he lived through this encounter. 

His mind's eye:

The forests and the forest people and their villages are burning. There is much bloodletting. The ground is gorged, it cannot possibly drink up all of it. It sloshes about the ankles of the soldiering and the marching and the frantic frightened running. The pursuers too. The blood that chokes the earth sloshes mire-like about the furnace steps of them all. Charlemagne has demanded these pagan northmen be put to kneel before the cross or be put to the sword. Slavery for their women and children…

… and the knights were thus dispatched thither…

The headhunter severed the line of thought or memory or whatever it was with brutal sudden cunning and roared into the empty silent night.

“Show yourself, mongrel!"" 

His laughter never seemed to cease. It stood in place of a physical person. Almost attaining its own physicality.

“You hurl insults because you've nothing else to throw! Nothing else to attack! You are hilarious, German! I've always liked you but you should not be so easy, not after all this time, no?"" 

He had to be careful. The sorcerer was dangerous. He could bend and weave reality seemingly at will, like a djin. None of his brotherhood nor the high priest could discern his source of power. Nor its limits. 

“I insult you, witch, because you and your kind are garbage."" 

Laughter that became a cacophonous crack! It dominated the world, the soundtrack hell to the neon witching scene. The music somehow came to life and began to play again, a wicked untethered horde flurry series of scaling and wild notes in wild man tandem with the laughter of the sorcerer, a corruption duet.

A ney. The headhunter remembers what it is that the instrument is called. A ney. 

Its sound and the sorcerer's laughter were a whirlwind maelstrom expansion sound swell within his skull. For a moment he considered taking his own blade and driving it into his own face, bashing it in and freeing that which was trapped within and growing, threatening to burst like the milk of green infection.

He stopped himself at the last moment. His training saving him. He recognized what was happening, what it was…

… bewitchment. 

He regained his focus against the tumult wave of sound storm wielded by the sorcerer, who once again cried out from nowhere. 

“Garbage! We are all garbage for the earth, German. We are all meat detritus for the watering jaws of the starving soil, we all return to it, are all reduced to ruin and returned to the sour womb to feed the indifferent planet. You know! You know! Only our petty Gods care! And so they fight! And, we, their moving pieces!”

And with that, the pieces did move. 

 Hand of Iblis. The mad sorcerer. 

Against champion of the goat-shape, Azræl.

And this modern Sodom of steel and human woe was to be the chess board for their latest match. A contest of secret champions. 

He did not see, but felt… 

Behind him. Movement. Killing stance. 

The headhunter whirled round with sudden animal speed in a counter slash. Roaring. 

But he roared… and slashed… at nothing. 

Nothing there. Only thin night air. 

Laughter/voice. Behind him again. 

“The same tricks always work on all of you."" 

He whirled once more. Nothing. 

The laughter again. Across the street. 

Azræl drew throwing dagger and with a lunge and a flick/turn of the forearm and wrist, threw the quivering blade. 

It struck pavement next to a dying drunk in a splatter burst of caveman fire spray. Grabby yelped. But there was no sorcerer of the sands over there. 

Or anywhere. 

Goddamit. 

""Up here.”

The headhunter whirled once more, a dancer upon my stage thought the sorcerer but kept it to himself. The German would not appreciate such an observation. 

""Why do you hide in a tree?” asked the black knight of the goat-shape order impetiously. 

The sorcerer grinned, balanced on the branch of a starving sapling oak. Running alongside a dark and quiet apartment building. 

""I've always appreciated a wider view, German. Always. Up here, I see more and I am closer to heaven and therefore I can see more like God. You… and your brothers… you stay down there in the dirt because you cannot know anything more."" 

Azræl raised blade. 

“Come down here and show me what I know, mongrel. Perhaps I can show you a thing or two as well."" 

The sorcerer shrugged. 

“Eh."" 

Azræl drew once more and threw. The throwing blade of ornate seven pointed star flew unabated, cutting through the nighttime chill like a deadly bird of sharpened stabbing steel. 

But when the piercing blade found the place in the tree where the heart of the sorcerer was, it no longer was there. 

It never had been. 

""I'm always behind you, German.” 

He spun on his booted heels and his great arms carried his tireless steel down in another great chop. But it was already too late. 

The sorcerer raised the ney and blocked the blow as if the wind instrument was an iron bar. He then flew in, swift movement that was not at all human or natural, stepping in close and bringing the long cylindrical body of the instrument down in a cracking blow across the headhunter's crown, splitting it and knocking consciousness from his mind's failing grip. 

But as he sent the headhunter's mind on a journey into darkness, he gave it another vision. A vision of flames. 

…

Jerusalem. 

Burning Jerusalem. 

where will you turn when it all goes wrong…?

The holy city is a cinder shrieking thousands as one. The holy city is in flames. 

… and you're on the run

And all around the city is a newly erected manmade hellscape forest grove. All around the city are the impaling lancing sticks. On them are the impaled. All of them are still screaming, screaming with their burning city. Man. Woman. Child. Animal. The warriors that have done this like to crucify lions for fun but for now, this will suffice. The people of the Lord's precious city will make satisfactory sport. 

And they do. As the forest of the impaled. All of them beg for death, they are the only words left, the only ones they can remember now in the throes of this special agony. Thousands upon thousands of shrieking lanced through but still living souls. Bodies skewered every which way, up through the groin, behind the genitals, upside down and through the tissue of the back, up the ass, gravity pulls savagely as if hungry and they slowly sink lower and lower along the stabbing spire body of the impaling lances as the time drags by with sadistic cruelty. The sheer heart attack torture of the sensations of tearing and rupture and bodily invasion and ruin as all and one horrible coalescence is all that any of them are capable of knowing in their last drawn out hours. For many it is days. 

And beside the forest of the impaled and all of its mindless shrieking, the burning city. 

Jerusalem. 

…

When the headhunter returned from darkness he was lying alone in the street. 

He sat up quickly, Panicked! 

His great sword was still clutched tightly. 

But when he looked around, the drunk that had been watching them was dead now. Blood foamed from his eyes and mouth like a hot porridge stew of thick sudsy pink. 

Worse yet, the sorcerer was gone. 

Worse than that, so were the heads. 

So was his offering…

Goddamit.

Is my being annoyed with this valid?","We've been together for over 3 years, living together for a little over a year. I have smoked since the very beginning (I offered to share a j with him on our first date). I say this to highlight that it has absolutely never been a secret that I like to smoke and do so often. I also consistently work, take care of my children, and have an excellent GPA (grad school). I help him regularly with work events because we're in the same field, I volunteer, I helped him with social media graphics, etc. I am not a stereotypical ""stoner"" in any way unless you see me bumming it at home. Per his request (and I do not mind this AT ALL) I only smoke outside and will sometimes vape inside (I asked him, he said the vape didn't bother him unless it had a strong smell so I specifically select for inoffensive smells now). I don't ask him to buy it for me, I don't care that he doesn't partake, and I've never gotten high enough to cause him an inconvenience. He's never had to take care of me in any way around this.

But JESUS CHRIST, THE EYEROLLS.  Any time I even mention going to the dispensary in a rundown of ""what're you up to today?"" he sighs, looks away, rolls his eyes, etc. I have mentioned this is annoying and makes me feel really judged, but he doesn't seem to take it seriously. Today he asked if I wanted to go get coffee, and I said I was going to wait until a little later so I can pick up my dispensary order at the same time (they're on the same street). He then said ""well, I was gonna go with you, but if you're already planning to be out for other stuff..."" I pointed out that I would love for him to still come with, I'd like his help getting groceries while we're out, etc. and he says ""I just don't want to go to the dispensary"" with a look that tells me he knows I'll find this ridiculous. I do. I remind him that he doesn't have to go inside, it's nicer than most pharmacies, and I'm just picking up what I've already ordered. He hems and haws about ""maybe,"" but has to go somewhere so our conversation was cut off. 

I'm really fucking annoyed with the judgement. I want to bring it up later today and tell him exactly how much it pisses me off, but I also don't want to fight. I've tried bringing it up before and he just says ""I don't judge you"" and changes zero percent. Just acts like it's not a thing. But it is to me. We don't generally fight, but I genuinely find myself wanting to fuss at him over this. I want to be snippy and rude about it. 

I may be inclined to forgive and forget this behavior if he was not a pack-a-day cigarette smoker. I'm not, but have obviously never cared about him smoking. I will occasionally make a joke about how it's going to kill him, but I genuinely  do not care. We all have our vices. He's asked me to pick up a pack for him before and I didn't think twice about it. I pay for them and don't ask for it back because we live in the same house and it's not a big deal. But you can't come with me to do household errands because one of my stops is the dispensary? GTFO

I've heard many stories on Reddit and I'd like to know your opinion. My native language isn't English, so I apologize if I make mistakes in my writing. I am a 30-year-old woman. And I am a nurse. This is important because of my shifts and overtime. My family has always been very close and, although I don't have any siblings, my cousins on my mother's side have been like brothers to me. A few years ago, my older cousin married a girl (from now on I will use fake names if you don't mind, because it's easier than calling people cousin, or cousin-in-law).My cousin-in-law will be named Amy and my older cousin, Lucas.Well, Lucas invited me to his wedding as a witness, and I was very happy. A mutual uncle (I'll call him Ron) was also a witness on my cousin's side.I wasn't invited to any of their bachelor parties; in fact, I had to organize a small bachelor party for Lucas myself (just a quiet coffee with our other cousins, that's all).When we arrived at the church, Amy introduced us to her mother, Lora, who kissed my uncle, but didn't kiss me. At the time, I thought it was strange, but I didn't think much of it. ""The nerves of seeing his daughter get married,"" I told myself. None of the other witnesses (there were eight of us in total, four for the groom and four for the bride) spoke to my uncle or me, neither before nor after the ceremony. After the ceremony, we went to the area where we would eat. I joined my mother's family because I'm not very sociable, I don't like crowds, and there I felt more or less safe. The bride and groom never approached us, even though we were the groom's family. In fact, I don't have a single photo with them from the entire ceremony.When we went to eat, I discovered that I had been seated at a different table from the rest of my family. It was just my little cousin and me there, with people I didn't know at all. It was the kind of table you invite out of obligation—friends of your parents and that sort of thing. I tried not to show it, but I was uncomfortable. My cousin tried to cheer me up, but when one of the people at the table He spilled his wine almost on me (I really dislike alcohol), and I couldn't take it anymore. I discreetly went to the bathroom and started crying....My mother found me a while later; she was angry with me. She told me to stop making a scene and that if I needed help, I should go to a psychologist. I pulled myself together as I had and returned to my table. I won't go into details, but the ceremony wasn't much better. Days later, I decided to see a psychologist to help me manage my emotions. My mother helped me choose a psychologist who seemed nice. At first, everything went more or less well. I was still hurting, and the psychologist recommended that I talk to my cousin about how I felt. That's what I did, and I opened up to my cousin. It was really hard, because I'm the type of person who runs from conflict, but oh well. I tried. Lucas said he was sorry I felt that way. But the seating arrangement was the work of his mother, my aunt, who was also my godmother.After that conversation, I decided to go talk to my aunt, Susan. She told me, and I quote: ""I'm sorry you felt that way, but I thought you'd prefer to be away from your parents to relax and socialize."" I told her that she knew I didn't feel comfortable around strangers and she said: well, that seems more like your problem than anything else, maybe you should work on that with a psychologist.I asked her how she knew about the psychologist, and she said: I was the one who told your mother about that psychologist. I felt betrayed and decided to go home. That day I argued with my mother and she told me: what does it matter who said it? The important thing is that you need help and the psychologist is helping you. I remember crying a lot that day.Months passed, and a year later, my Amy gave birth to Max, my cousin's son. The boy is 8 months old now, and I've only seen him once. I hope this helps you understand that I haven't been able to create a real bond with the child. About five months ago, my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and both my father and I have dedicated ourselves to her and her health. My family is there for her too, except for Lucas, who hasn't called my mother even once.Neither has Ami during all this time. Fortunately, the chemotherapy and subsequent surgery seem to be going well, but my mother's mental health is deteriorating significantly.Most days, she cries because everything is a big deal to her.Well, a few weeks ago, my mother told me: don't say anything, but Lucas is going to call you to tell you that they're going to have Max's christening. I told her: I'm glad.Shortly after, I received a call from work asking if I was interested in taking on on-call shifts. I said yes, because I had recently bought a house and had to pay the mortgage. One of the days they offered me was February 14th. Since I had no plans for that day, I took it. On February 12th, at 7:30 pm, Lucas called me to say that he would love for me to come to his son's christening on February 14th, two days after his call.I froze for a few minutes and explained the situation... the baptism would be in another city, two hours away from mine, and I was working that day from 8 am to 8 pm. Which made it impossible.  I thought that was the end of it. From my family, only my cousin's parents, my uncle, an aunt, my parents, and I were invited to the christening. My mother said she didn't feel well enough to make that trip and be there.She didn't want to be the center of attention We all understood. The christening was exactly one week ago, and only my cousin's parents and my two uncles attended.Recently, one of my uncles told me that my cousin and his parents are disappointed in me for not being able to move on from the wedding, and for holding so much resentment towards my cousin that I didn't want to go to the christening.But that's not the case. However, my whole family thinks that because that's what my cousin told his parents after our conversation...He says I owe Lucas an apology. But I don't feel like I saw anything wrong. So, am I the bad guy for not going to Max's christening? Any opinions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and sorry for the inconvenience. ",12,1771685419.0,amiwrong,10,1.0,False

When we finally talked, he said something that really broke me. He said that lately it doesn’t feel that different whether I’m in his life or not. Not because I don’t matter, but because he sort of got the hang without me. I have observed also that he have the resources now as his distractions (Maybe?) , e.g laptop, games (Dota), friends, coffee shops, and he said hes getting used to doing things alone. He admitted he doesn’t feel urgency to “fix” anything and that he doesn’t have the drive right now. I reached out first btw, and he said hes unsure thats why he doesnt want to talk yet cause he knows that it would hurt me if he said those things about something he wasnt sure, but i reached out and wanted to talk thats why he said that.

This is the first time in 4.6 years that he’s ever said something like that. And that’s what shattered me.

I told him I’ve been choosing him consistently, especially when things get hard, because I wanted him in it. I reminded him I’ve been there through his lowest points. That’s why hearing that it doesn’t feel different hurt me so deeply.

What’s confusing is that we were okay before this. It feels like everything shifted after one misunderstanding. Now I’m left feeling small and scared, while he seems able to emotionally detach and “manage.”

I don’t know if this is LDR adjustment, avoidance, or the beginning of him emotionally checking out. I love him deeply, but I don’t know how to stay in a relationship where one person is unsure and the other is trying to hold everything together.

Has anyone experienced something like this after years together? Did it recover? Or is this usually a sign that the emotional shift has already happened?",3,1771685098.0,BreakUps,9,0.81,False

I go to a café hoping to enjoy the smell of coffee, but often the doors stay open and people stand right by the entrance or windows, so strong cigarette smell drifts inside.

1rasrea,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiPizza/comments/1rasrea/day_1_of_resharing_my_suno_ai_dirty_tricks/,Day #1 of re-sharing my Suno AI Dirty Tricks,"## TRICK #4: Live Concert Mode with Sound Effects

### Injecting Environment and Crowd Behavior

**Reliability: High**

### What This Trick Actually Does

This trick uses **environmental cues inside the lyrics** to bias Suno toward:
- Live recordings
- Audience noise
- Imperfect timing
- Raw vocal delivery

You are NOT ""adding sound effects"". You are **changing the performance context**.

---

### Why This Works

Suno associates certain textual patterns with:
- Concert recordings
- Live performances
- Crowd interaction

When it sees those cues, it shifts:
- **Vocal polish** - decreases (more raw)
- **Timing** - becomes looser
- **Ambience** - adds space and noise

---

### Syntax Reference

**Section tags** set the context:
```
[Intro: Live Crowd Cheering]
[Stage Ambience]
[Outro: Applause, Crowd Going Wild]
```

**Asterisks** add non-sung sound events:
```
*crowd roaring*
*audience cheering*
*applause*
```

The asterisks tell Suno: ""This is not to be sung"".

---

### Sound Effects Reference (Asterisk Syntax)

#### Live Atmospheres
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*crowd cheering*` | Applause and screams |
| `*audience singalong*` | Crowd singing along |
| `*festival roar*` | Stadium/festival roar |
| `*applause*` | Final applause |

#### Dramatic Effects
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*thunder*` | Thunder for epic moments |
| `*gunshots*` | For rap/trap/metal |
| `*explosion*` | For EDM drops |
| `*glass breaking*` | Breaking glass |

#### Environments
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*café ambience*` | Coffee shop chatter |
| `*rain falling*` | Melancholic atmosphere |
| `*wind howling*` | Isolated, cold feeling |

#### Narrative
| Syntax | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `*phone ringing*` | Phone ring |
| `*door slamming*` | Door slam |
| `*footsteps*` | Footsteps |
| `*heartbeat*` | Heartbeat pulse |

---

### One Real Prompt (Copy / Paste)

**Lyrics:**
```
[Intro: Live Crowd Cheering]
[Stage Ambience]

*crowd noise building*

Are you ready tonight?!

*crowd roaring*

We came here to rock!
We came here to feel alive!

*audience cheering*

[Chorus]
This is where I belong!
Singing with you all night long!

*crowd singalong*

[Outro: Applause, Crowd Going Wild]
```

**Style:**
```
Live concert recording, raw rock energy, festival atmosphere, audience interaction, stadium rock sound, powerful male vocals, imperfect timing, authentic live feel, mid-tempo (115-125 BPM), anthemic chorus, crowd participation, sweaty and real
```

---

### When This Fails

This trick fails when:
- Used with highly polished genres (clean pop, EDM)
- Combined with ""clean / studio / pristine"" keywords
- Overused (too many sound effect cues)
- Cues contradict the style prompt

**What happens when it fails:** Results sound confused-half studio, half live - or Suno ignores the cues entirely.

---

### Iteration Advice

- **Less is more** - one or two live cues are enough
- **Match genre** - live cues work best with rock, folk, singer-songwriter
- **Place cues at structural moments** - intro, between sections, outro
- **Don't expect precise sound effects** - think ""atmosphere"", not ""specific sound""

If thoughts create everything then if I sat on my living room chair and believed 1000% I was a millionaire then 1 million will somehow find its way into my lap.

Or

Do I need to go out and make 1 million through some chain of events? Because if we were to go by this logic then realistically LOA is just a confidence boost that pushes you to take action toward your goal. That’s not the universe moving or magical or spiritual. That’s no different to me saying ‘I believe I am going to drink coffee today’ and then taking myself to the store to buy coffee - The universe didn’t move, I just got of my lazy ass and did it.

I guess what I am asking is…. Is it really as simple as believing you already have it and then it will magically appear or does the positive mindset just push us to take action?

Because going by some people’s comments on here - You can literally sit on a chair and manifest something into your hand without moving a muscle and surely that’s bordering on delusional?

• Your income increased… but your savings didn’t

• You’ve tried budgeting apps and abandoned them

• You don’t want to track every coffee

• You just want clarity and control

1️⃣ Save first

2️⃣ Cover fixed expenses

3️⃣ Live on one clear weekly number

No endless categories.

No spreadsheet obsession.

No financial guilt.

Just one number you respect each week.

⸻

Who This Is For

Middle-class earners who make enough…

but feel like money still slips through their fingers.

If every dollar disappears because income is too low, this isn’t the solution.

But if you earn well and still feel disorganized then structure changes everything.

⸻

What Happens When It Works

• Less anxiety

• No “where did it go?” moments

• Small weekly wins

• A rising savings rate

This system took me from \~5% savings annually to 20%+.

Not by earning more.

By creating guardrails.

1. I meet someone I like
2. We start hanging out as friends
3. We connect well and build a nice friendship
4. They start showing their flaws
5. I cringe and hyper-focus on those flaws
6. I distance myself, sometimes without explanation
7. Friendship is gone and I’m alone again



And I’m talking about genuinely nice people, the kind I could easily see once in a while for coffee or a yoga class.

Why can’t I deal with people not being perfect? It almost feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy: I *know* that at some point they’ll prove to me they’re annoying… and then I zero in on it when it happens.

I suspect this might be related to my RSD and general ADHD overstimulation. I’m actively trying to be more mindful and to give people space to be human. I’m also trying to sit with the cringe I feel when someone does or says something weird instead of immediately pulling away.

But the pattern is very real. I’ve complained my whole life that I only have a few friends, and I’m realizing now that I might be the one creating that outcome. I tend to get overstimulated by people and then just… push them away.

Your ~~basement dwelling overlords~~...*Friendly Neighborhood Mod Team* would like to announce the start of Show and Tell Saturdays here on r/AskTheWorld. It'll be a weekly megathread posted every Saturday (hence the name) where users can share things about their area and their culture that they think are are worth highlighting for the rest of the world. Does your city boast the western hemisphere's largest ball of twine? Does your province have a week long festival dedicated to air guitar? Did your village elect a dog as mayor, twice? Even if it isn't terribly quirky, we'd still love to hear it. Is there a local dish that you think doesn't get enough love on the international stage? Did your town just finish renovating the fountain at the park, and you think they did a great job?  That's worth sharing, too! Whether it's completely insane, mildly compelling, or something you're sure you're the only person in the world who'd be interested in it, we'd love to hear it.

  
The goal here is to help people get a better look at the parts of a country's culture that you feel aren't highlighted enough by media headlines or a glance at a wikipedia article. Now, I know what you're thinking, ""But Argo! I thought r/AskTheWorld was only for arguing about politics!"" and yes, the nature of the sub lends itself well to incessant posts about geopolitics, Americans asking 14 times a day if everyone still hates them, and fights between users that involve slurs my American ass has to put into google translate in order to comprehend. But this sub is -at it's best when it's fostering an exchange of cultures, and we hope that this will provide an additional space to do so. 



# TL;DR

Every Saturday, we'll post a Show and Tell Thread!

  
The sub's rules on posts being relevant to multiple countries, and, you know, needing to be an actual question, won't apply in the thread. All that matters is that it's about something about where you live or the culture you're a part of that you'd like to share. You could post ""check out this cool building in my hometown!"" and leave it at that, or you could write 5000 words on why you think everyone in the world should know about your favorite coffee shop. If it's sharing a piece of your culture, it belongs in the thread.

  
This hopefully goes without saying, but all other sub rules (and sitewide rules) still apply, particularly the rules about civility and agenda pushing. Be nice, ~~or else.~~



All credit for this idea goes to the visionary user known as [Fwoggie2](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fwoggie2/), who suggested the concept several weeks ago. We greatly appreciate the community that's grown on this sub (430,000 strong!), and we are always open to ideas from you guys on how to make r/asktheworld as great as it can be.

  
So, with that out of the way...who's got something cool to share with the class?

1rashg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicRossAmico/comments/1rashg8/enjoy_your_coffee_black_on_sweetness_and_light/,Enjoy Your Coffee Black on “Sweetness and Light”,"Very little is known about the Chevalier de Meude-Monpas. Among what we DO know is that he was a musketeer in the service of Louis XVI, who went into exile with the onset of the French Revolution. He also studied music in Paris and published six concertos for violin in 1786. In 1997, violinist Rachel Barton (now Rachel Barton Pine) put together a revelatory album for Cedille Records, “Violin Concertos by Black Composers of the 18th and 19th Centuries.” Meude-Monpas’ Violin Concerto No. 4 will be among the featured works this morning on “Sweetness and Light,” cumulatively guaranteed to put a smile on your face.\*  
  
Much better known, William Grant Still was regarded in his day as the “Dean of Afro-American Composers.” He the first composer of color to have a symphony performed by a major orchestra, the first to have a symphony widely performed, the first to conduct a major orchestra, and the first to have an opera televised nationally. A pupil of both George Whitefield Chadwick and Edgard Varèse, Still certainly had “serious” credentials, but he also worked in pit bands and wrote arrangements for Hollywood musicals. In many senses, he was the quintessential American composer. Also, he always knew how to write a good tune. This morning we’ll enjoy his “Danzas de Panama,” performed by the Oregon String Quartet.  
  
It took nearly 90 years for Florence Price to become an overnight success. Price was the first African American woman to have a symphony performed by a major orchestra. Her Symphony No. 1 was played by the Chicago Symphony, conducted by Frederick Stock, in 1933. But it’s only fairly recently, after decades of comparative neglect, that her music has finally begun to gain traction. From a 2-disc set devoted to her piano works on the Guild label, we’ll hear Kirsten Johnson play “Dreamboat.”  
  
Duke Ellington requires little introduction. He was a major figure in American music, especially in the field of jazz. But for the past hundred years or so, there has been quite a bit of “blurring of the lines” between genres of art music. In 1943, Ellington composed “New World a-Comin’,” a work for piano and 15-piece band. He never wrote down the piano part, so it was reconstructed by ear by Maurice Peress from a recording made of an Ellington concert at Carnegie Hall in 1943. Subsequently, Peress expanded the jazz band to full orchestra. The soloist on the recording we’ll hear, Jeffrey Biegel, obtained permission from Sir Roland Hanna to transcribe the improvised final cadenza from a recording Hanna made with the American Symphony Orchestra under Peress’ baton.  
  
We’ll be enjoying our coffee black on “Sweetness and Light,” this Saturday morning at 11:00 EST/8:00 PST, exclusively on KWAX Classical Oregon!

1rash8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/pinteresttrends/comments/1rash8z/awaken_your_inner_calm_how_coloring_rekindled_my/,**Awaken Your Inner Calm: How Coloring Rekindled My Peace in a Noisy Digital World 🎨🌙**,"**Title:** The Quiet Revolution of Coloring For Adults 🖍️✨  

Have you ever noticed how our minds crave something peaceful — but our screens rarely deliver it?  
I used to scroll endlessly, hoping to “relax,” only to end up more wired than before. Then one night, I stumbled on something old-school: coloring.  

No, not for kids. For grown-ups.  
A *coloring book adult pdf* that felt oddly healing.  

Here’s what I discovered after a week of coloring before bed instead of doom-scrolling:  

• My sleep got deeper, my stress leveled out, and my thoughts felt quieter.  
• It became my five-minute meditation — with crayons and imagination, no yoga mat required.  
• The simple act of filling in color brought me back to presence.  

That moment reminded me why I started sharing creative resources online. Joy doesn’t have to be complicated — sometimes it’s black-and-white pages waiting to be filled.  

So I put together something for the community here: a **free adult coloring ebook (PDF download)** designed to calm your mind and spark your creativity.  
👉 Get it here: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Inside, you’ll find elegant patterns, mindful themes, and pages that turn stress into stillness.  
Perfect for your next coffee break, quiet evening, or digital detox experiment.  

I’ve heard from people who keep a printed version on their desks — it’s their quick escape from chaos — and from others who use it as part of their journaling or gratitude practice.  

So if the noise in your day ever feels a bit too loud, try this:  
Put your phone down, grab a pencil, and give yourself ten minutes with these pages.  
👉 Download your free adult coloring PDF here: [https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook](https://cashflowmanifest.com/Free-ebook)

Because peace doesn’t have to cost anything, and art doesn’t stop being beautiful once we grow up. 💜  

And in case you missed it — or want to share some calm with a stressed friend — here’s the link once more:

1rase62,https://i.redd.it/4t20kvwvxukg1.png,0 Proposals Sent. 1 Hire. I Think I Broke Upwork.,"I logged into Upwork today and almost spit out my coffee.

**0 proposals sent.**  
**0 viewed.**  
**0 interviews.**  
**1 hire.**

Yes. You read that right.

According to my dashboard, I’ve apparently mastered the ancient art of getting hired without applying to a single job. I’ve ascended. I’ve transcended. I’ve become… employable by telepathy.

Here’s what actually happened.

About three weeks ago, I cleaned up my profile. Nothing crazy. No boosting. No connects burned. No desperate 2am proposal essays that start with “I noticed you’re looking for…”

I rewrote my bio like a human instead of a corporate brochure.  
I added real results instead of buzzwords.  
I turned on “Available Now.”  
Then I closed the tab and forgot about it.

Fast forward to this week. I wake up to a message:

>

At first I thought it was one of those scam invites where they ask you to download Telegram and wire $3,000 to unlock your destiny.

It wasn’t.

We chatted. No interview call. No 12-step screening process. No “what’s your rate?” followed by ghosting. Just a normal conversation.

Two days later: **Contract sent.**

And now my dashboard looks like I hacked the matrix.

What’s wild is this:

For months I was obsessing over proposal open rates, tweaking templates, analyzing job posts like they were encrypted CIA files.

And the one job I land?  
No proposal.  
No boosting.  
No bidding war.

Just a solid profile sitting there like bait.

Here’s my takeaway (and I’m still processing this):

• Clients *do* search profiles.  
• Your profile matters more than your proposal copy sometimes.  
• Desperation energy probably seeps through the screen.  
• The algorithm is either chaos or dark magic.

I’m not saying “never send proposals.” Obviously that’s the main way to get work.

But if you’re stuck grinding out 20 applications a day and getting nothing back… maybe pause and ask:

If someone randomly landed on my profile right now, would they instantly understand what I do and why I’m good at it?

Because apparently… that’s all it took.

Anyway, I just wanted to share because this feels like the most backwards success story ever.

Has anyone else gotten hired without sending a single proposal?

Or did I just use up all my freelance luck for 2026?",11,1771683938.0,Upwork,26,0.74,False

You have your morning coffee or cutter chai. You feel awake. You feel energetic. Then afternoon arrives. Your energy drops. You need a nap. This sudden fatigue is the caffeine crash.

Here is the science.
Your brain produces a chemical called adenosine. Adenosine promotes sleep. Caffeine blocks this chemical. Caffeine binds to the receptors. You feel alert.
But the brain continues producing adenosine. The chemical accumulates.
When caffeine leaves the system, the blockage ends. The adenosine floods the brain. You feel exhausted instantly.

Caffeine also spikes cortisol. Cortisol burns energy reserves.

Our environment makes things worse.
In humid cities like Mumbai, you sweat. Caffeine is a diuretic. You pee more. You get dehydrated.
In dry cities like Delhi, the heat dries the skin.
We also have hard water issues. Hard water affects hydration.
Drinking more than 3 cups invites anxiety.

Fix the problem.
Drink plenty of water. Have a glass before and after your chai.
Eat food. Fruits and nuts stabilize energy.
Avoid drinking on an empty stomach.

1rasbp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1rasbp0/dial_in_help/,Dial in help,"I think I'm struggling to dial these in. I say think because I was assuming more punchy flavor profiles.

I tried my general go for each which is 30:500

Hario V60
Grind of 7 on ODE 2 I would say on the coarse end of medium for those who don't own an ODE.

Bloom 90° roughly 80g
Second bloom 91-92° roughly 80g
Final pour 93° remaining weight to 500g 

Per Percs recs I did try pushing them a little harder at 97°. But don't feel like I got a better cup.

They're all roast date 01/11 rested for 4 weeks. Now in freezer.

1rasb2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1rasb2b/what_differences_in_coffee_taste_did_you_notice/,What differences in coffee taste did you notice between between your old coffeemaker and your current moccamaster?,"Feel free to add any helpful pointers to getting the perfect cup.

 I've been using Ethiopian beans from Vigilante in a Baratza Virtuoso + (grind setting 17, 40 seconds for .9-1L of water). 

**Before**: In a $25 Mr. Coffee Machine. The hot coffee tasted ""fine"". I would jar the excess in a airtight glass container and let it sit overnight in the fridge for iced coffee the next day - the coffee sometimes tasted fine and sometimes tasted plasticky. I couldn't discern most of the tasting notes and any subtle sweetness, hot or cold. 

**After:** The hot coffee is more acidic than the Mr. Coffee machine. It's not bad and it could be argued as a fresh brightness but I'm not sure - the beans say it has notes of Blueberry, Brown Sugar, and Pecan that I'm not detecting. 

* I tried using the half pot switch and a 15 grind setting which produced  astringent coffee - so I defaulted back to a 17 grind setting.
*  I'm not sure I notice a difference between the half pot switch or full pot one. 

When I jar the excess and refrigerate for iced coffee - the flavor notes are more pronounced and the iced coffee is far more aromatic - ironic given that the iced coffee is less ""fresh"" than the hot one. This was a pleasant surprise.
