I come home to a mopey cat who just sits by the door and looks sad all the time (she's the favorite, I'm just an occasional source of food).

There's no hug when I get out of work for lunch or big kiss when I get home.

I don't get to hear her laugh when I sing to the kitty, no listening to her putter around while I'm reading, no good morning with a coffee already made when I get out of the bathroom.

I miss her, I miss waking up next to my best friend, I miss making dinner and singing songs in the kitchen, I miss doing the dishes together, eating lunch together every day, our walk to work, her little snores when she falls asleep in her chair, and a thousand more little things.

It's only been 4 days, we haven't missed out on anything cool, there wasn't some big thing I wanted to do... I just miss living with her and all her little idiosyncrasies, our home feels so empty without her here. 

At least she's having fun, out on a beach trip with her best friend and her family. I'm happy she's enjoying herself, she says the fresh air and sea water are doing wonders for her mental health, but God, I'm practically counting down the minutes until she's home, I can't wait to see her smile when she comes through the door.",1,1748275874.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

I will be a stay at home mom (former public school teacher) and my partner works in tech and will be commuting to SF downtown and Palo Alto. 

I am a SF native (3rd gen) and spent my first 18 years in the Inner & Outer Sunset. My partner spent his youth in Cupertino with a brief stint in SOMA in his 20s. For the last 7 years, we’ve lived in Oakland. 

We like having a little space/privacy and are used to driving for errands/coffee, etc. I like being close to green and having a view. Friendly neighbors with young kids would be nice, but not must have. 

We are interested in the west side of Twin Peaks/Midtown Terrace, but I’m seeing a lot of comments warning about the fog & wind on this side. I think I’ll do okay, but my partner is a little worried. 

Any ideas how the fog/wind on west side of Twin Peaks compares to the Outer Sunset? 

Does this area sound like a good fit for us?

Thanks in advance!

Highly recommend visiting for any F1 fan, walking the Monaco circuit is an awesome experience. I wasn't aware previously, but right in the Fairmont Hairpin, the worlds most famous bend of the circuit is situated a Xerjoff boutique. So naturally I had to visit. This was my first experience with anything Xerjoff except Naxos and honestly I was overwhelmed. I didn't know, how many fragrances Xerjoff has. Well I decided to start with the Vibe line:

**Erba Pura, Erba Gold, Purple Accento** \- honestly not a big fan of the Erbas. They are very fruity, but waaay to synthetic to my nose. Off of these, I liked the Purple Accento, pineapple opening, a little bit spicy, slightly feminine. Also 700€ a bottle lol.

Then it was onto the ATP Finals Torino line:

**Torino21** \- lime, mint, basil, summer in the bottle, I draw similarities to Pacific Chill.

**Torino22** \- saffron, tea, (I had to look this note up) eucalyptus, more feminine and honestly I didn't like it very much, not a big fan of saffron.

**Torino23** \- very floral, which isn't bad, I like some of the floral frags, like Reflection Man, but this would require more testing from my part and I wasn't in love with it on first sniff.

**Torino24** \- holy hell I love this on my partner. Creamy musky mango, saw people comparing it with Valaya, but this is way better. This was one of the samples I took with myself and I bought a 15 ml bottle for my partner. I already love it on her so much, I am going to buy her a full bottle after she uses it up.

XJ 1861 line:

**Naxos** \- I don't really have to introduce this fragrance right? I am coming over on Naxos, I wasn't the biggest fan in the beginning, but the more I try it, the even more I want to try it. I hope to secure a 15 ml bottle soon.

**Zefiro** \- resinous cardamom, incense, bergamot, later I found the wine note, honestly not for me, but very intriguing fragrance.

**Decas** \- This intoxicating citrusy vanilla, opens very sweet, I wouldn't be afraid to call it a gourmand. I wish I got a sample of this one, I might the next time I visit their boutique.

**Renaissance** \- another one I really liked, citrus mint, very similar to Torino21, but more creamy and also more spicy.

Join the Club line:

**40 Knots** \- I heard a lot about this and honestly? Not a fan. I find the smell very difficult and I love marine notes. This is green, woody, salty and pretty harsh to me.

**40 Noeuds** \- Monaco boutique exclusive fragrance, I had to smell this. It is a spin off of 40 Knots with added rose note. And I have to say, it makes it so much better. It still keeps the green woody feel, but is less salty and more balanced. I have been thinking about it way too much lately so I am afraid I will have to visit Monaco again to get it.

**Yacht Club de Monaco** \- another Monaco exclusive. Best described as cherry cinnamon cigarette. Very good fragrance, but due to my disdain for cherry notes not for me.

I wanted to try more fragrances from this line, but my nose was becoming very tired, so we checked only 5 more bottles.

**Louis XV 1722** \- the champagne fragrance caught my eye. Opens up almost sparkly, grapefruity, but turns more creamy nutty. I am very intrigued by this one and I will get a sample later, like many other Xerjoffs, I feel you need to wear them more times to appreciate them right.

**Tony Iommi Monkey Special** \- Big fan of Black Sabbath, had to smell this one. Leathery sweet heavy fragrance, at first I got this coffee and chocolate vibe, but it turns out it is the patchouli cinnamon caramel combo. I got a sample of this and sadly, I like it more on paper then on my skin.

In the end the we got presented the newest fragrances, Duran Duran blends. I have no idea who the Duran Duran band is, but that never stopped me.

**Duran Duran NeoRio** \- even though I am a fan of fig notes, I didn't really like this one. Very similar to Monkey Special, but somehow lighter and missing something.

**Duran Duran Black Moonlight** \- another saffron smell, I also get oud and some similarities to Monkey Special. A little bit disappointed with this one.

Last bottle we smelled was for my partner, and also the only one from Casamorati, a sister house to Xerjoff.

**Dama Bianca** \- very soft florals, heavy on iris and violet, musky vanilla scent. We ended up get a sample of this one as well and my partner was wearing this and she says it grows on her and she likes it more then before. Not as good as Torino24 though.

As I was looking for high heat summer scent, the two bottles that I liked the most and ended up deciding on were Torino21 and Renaissance. In the end I ended up picking Torino21, the scent is gorgeous, it is literally mojito as a fragrance. I got a 50 ml bottle for 195€, so you can paint the picture. What turned me from Renaissance in the end was the spicy, slightly harsh patchouli in the dry down.

In conclusion I loved the visit, I learned quite a bit about the house, the staff was great and guided me through the whole visit. I didn't get to smell any scents from the Oud Stars, Shooting Stars and Coffee Break lines, so I hope to visit another boutique soon.",2,1748275714.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

I have suicidal thoughts weekly, but have been this way for years. I’d still have struggles with self harm (or the urge too), anxiety, I lost interest in all hobbies and no energy once off work. Only drinking coffee gives my energy. 

I did loose my dad to suicide 3 years ago- so that trauma could play part in my lack of personality. I’ve really done nothing but work, and be on my phone, TV, and play w my cats. 

Anyways, I quit. Hoping my suicidal thoughts would stop, I’ve had these thoughts for as long as I can remember. I’m 25 now. I didn’t think I was experiencing withdrawal symptoms but the other day I was about ready to do it. I’ve been off maybe 2-3 weeks? I finally enrolled in therapy. Start Saturday. I feel more energy though, I feel like I can pick up a hobby again. I let things go that normally make me spiral. I did have some bad days though here, my bf thought I was about to have a “schizophrenic episode” which was rude of him to say but I was freaking out. I just want the thoughts to go away, I dnt wanna hurt myself. I really hope getting off of this I’ll be who I used to be, over 3 years ago. I miss that person so much.

**Blurb:**

**What does it take to turn your life around? Death, of course!** 

I died in this lame ass world of ours and woke up in a completely new one. I had a new name, a new face and a new body. This was my second chance to live a better life than the previous one. 

But goddamn it, why did I have to be a witch? Now I don't just have to be on the run from the Inquisition that wants to burn me and my friends. But I also have to earn a living? 

**Follow Elsa Grimly as she:** 

1. Makes new friends and tries to save them and herself from getting burned
2. Finds redemption from the deeds of her previous life
3. Tries to get along with a cat who (like most cats) believes she runs the world
4. Deals with other slice of life shenanigans

  
\_\_

**Chapter 34. Questions**

""It's time for some answers,"" I mumbled as I drew in a breath, my eyes intent on the Osteodial.

According to the guide, this method of divination was much more advanced than the usual ones that old Elsa used to conduct for a price. What made this method more advanced? The fact that the diviner had to interact with the world beyond the veil.

While the divination results carried out like this were more accurate than the regular ones, they never gave a single definite answer. The reason for this divination being cryptic was the same reason why Smokewell's bread puffing only gave us omens of the future rather than a clear vision of what is going to happen. That reason was the fragility of a mortal mind.

Mortals are weak compared to whatever lies beyond the veil. It is not that it's not possible to lift the veil and look beyond. It's that you either have to hate living your life or be out of your mind to actually do it.

I took another deep breath and focused my mind on the obsidian key in front of me. Then I focused on charging the osteodial with malice. I felt the device grow slightly heavy in my hand as my malice flowed through the symbol I'd carved on the lower side of the device. I focused on my first question.

*'Is the place where the key comes from nearby?'*

The guide had instructed to start with a simple question to establish a stable link with the world beyond the veil. So I focused on that question and kept pushing my malice into the device.

Then the golden bone fixed in the semi-solid, pinkish substratum started to hum. Then it started to move, slowly rotating like the needle of a compass. The pointer stopped on the symbol that represented ""No"" in the witchcraft symbology.

I knew that was going to be the answer. That meant I'd formed a link with the world beyond the veil. Now I had to push a little deeper.

I kept the flow of malice into the symbol at the bottom even and focused on my next question.

*'Is the place where the key comes from physically reachable?'*

The device became a little heavier. The golden bone hummed softly and began to move in its place. It rotated once, twice, thrice...and then a fourth time before becoming parallel to the line I'd carved in the middle of the two symbols.

That meant the answer could be both yes and no and neither. That answer was also expected. I could feel a slight tingling in my head as I kept charging the device with malice. My connection to the world beyond the veil was getting clearer.

It was time to get to the real questions now.

*'Do I know the person that sent the key into the mortal world?'*

This time the pointer moved twice before it stopped on the symbol that represented 'yes.'

My focus almost faltered at the answer I received. I wasn't expecting it to say that. I didn't let my mind get too distracted and focused on the flow of my malice and moved onto the next question.

*'Is it dangerous to use the key?'*

The pointer moved only once this time. The answer that came was 'yes'. I felt my throat running dry. I was starting to feel a bit dazed. I had to end the divination soon or else I might break the barrier between the mortal realm and the veil that separated the world beyond. The guide hadn't gone much in depth about the dangers of it happening. But its warnings had been grave. They had to be taken seriously.

I focused on my last question.

*'Does the owner of the key mean harm to me?’*

The device got heavier in my hand. My eyes started to feel a slight sting as I kept gazing at the pointer. The thing started to rotate again. Once...twice...thrice...then it stopped.

The golden bone was parallel to the groove again. Neither a yes or no.

I quickly severed the link between me and the world beyond the veil. I put the osteodial down on the coffee table and took a few steps back. My feet trembled a bit and sweat had broken out on my forehead. I took a deep breath and let it out slowly.

I poured myself a glass of water and downed it in a single gulp.

Once my mind had cleared up and the feeling of dizziness had left me, I gathered my thoughts again.

The conclusions that I drew from my little experiment were as follows: Firstly, the osteodial had said that I knew the person who had sent the key to the mortal realm. It might've also meant that maybe it was old Elsa who knew this person beyond the veil. Because I couldn't imagine how my insignificant self might've formed a bond with someone from another realm in my previous life. Not like I could remember any instances of conducting a stereotypical black magic ritual just for laughs and ending up getting entangled with a real monster or deity. So, it was safe to assume that this person beyond the veil was someone old Elsa knew and not me.

Secondly, I wasn't surprised that using the key being dangerous was a possibility. I was still quite new in this world. Even though I had the liberation ritual under my belt. There were more than a few things about witchcraft and this world that I didn't know yet. So, that answer made complete sense.

Thirdly, I still couldn't comprehend what to make of the answer to my last question. Either the person who sent the key meant harm to me or they didn't or they were uncertain about what they wanted to do to me once they found me.

My theory about this person being old Elsa asking for help through supernatural means began to feel less plausible. Maybe it was possible that it was someone Elsa knew and maybe this person wanted to settle some old score with her. That brought up another question. ""Do I even want to get involved with this stuff?""

Currently, the answer was an obvious no. I didn't know half of anything that was happening and I was half-unaware of all the stuff that I was capable of. The final verdict was clear though.

The black key wasn't something to be fucked with for now. Maybe, once I knew more about the world beyond the veil or at least after I'd learnt or ""re-learnt"" all the spells and rituals in my hexonomicon, I might think of dealing with the key.

""But right now, you are going somewhere I or anyone else can't see you,"" I said as I put the key in a small pouch and shoved it into my suitcase. I'd shove the pouch under a floorboard once I picked which room I wanted to sleep in.

That's when I heard a soft grumbling from behind me. Lenora had woken up.

I felt my lips turning into a grin even though I felt slightly bad to find her pained expression amusing. I stepped up to her and said, ""Let me guess. Headache, inability to focus, scrambled thoughts and a sense of fatigue?""

Even through her mask of pain, Lenora managed to show a look of surprise at my deduction. ""Um...precisely."" She let out a breath. ""I guess being perceptive comes with the perks of being a witch.""

""Not at all,"" I said. ""It's just that I've been in your place more than a few times.""

""My sympathies are with you."" Lenora squeezed the bridge of her nose, wincing a little.

""You should go out and get some fresh air,"" I said. ""I have a few things I need to take care of."" I turned and went upstairs to where the bedrooms were.

I looked at the mattress that had been folded and put in the closet in the first bedroom. I pulled it out but my steps staggered as I carried it out before I lost my balance. I was ready to tumble to the ground with the thing cushioning my fall. But the fall never came.

Someone had already braced me. It was Lenora. ""I'm the one hungover but somehow you are finding it hard to keep standing,"" she said playfully.

I grinned and backed off, letting her hold up the mattress on her own. She didn't have the same difficulty holding it up as I had. ""You know, I've done this kind of thing almost all my life."" She carried the mattress out into the balcony and put it out on the banister.

While she was at it, I brought the second mattress from the other room and she took it from me and set it next to the first on the rail. We did the same for the third one. We then took turns smacking at the mattresses with my broom to knock off all the dust. ""Your head isn't hurting anymore?"" I asked as I stepped back and handed the broom to her.

""Not now that I'm busy with something,"" she said. ""I'm quite good at ignoring my problems by getting busy with chores.""

I gave a wry smile and leaned back and watched her as she dusted the mattresses. ""Are you sure about this?"" I asked.

""About what?""

""About this arrangement,"" I said. ""You living with us--a bunch of witches. Are you really sure you don't feel scared? Or uncomfortable?""

Lenora stopped and sighed. ""I don't, but I'm curious. What if I said no?"" she said. ""Would you leave the house? Or would you make me leave.""

I pursed my lips and looked away when a gust of wind blew into our hairs. ""I don't know. That would be a complicated situation, though.""

""Why would it be complicated? You would just be on your way and I would be on my own."" She shrugged.

""No, the complicated part would be wondering if you would go to the Inquistion and report us. I'm not saying that you are going to do that. But if things happened the way you just said, it would put me and my friends in a situation where we would have to worry about getting snitched on.""

Lenora nodded with a surprising amount of understanding to my statement. ""I think that's a valid concern to have if one was in your shoes,"" she said. ""But you don't have to worry about me snitching on you. The only scenario in which I would do that is if you were serious about turning me into a flesh puppet."" She winked and passed the broom.

I couldn't help but chuckle as I took the broom from her. ""Don't mind Lily and Smokewell. They are just...well, they are weird people but I know that neither of them wants to hurt anyone."" I began dusting the third mattress.

Lenora stepped aside and leaned against the banister. ""It must be nice to have someone you could rely on, right?"" she said.

That caught me a bit off guard but I gave a nod.

""You really do care about each other. I can tell,"" she said. ""It's a scary thing, being alone, I mean. I realized when I finally divorced Clyde. I knew what he and I had wasn't a good thing but I couldn't deny that I had started to depend on his harshness and his...his control on my life. I know it was bad but...it was something. Even though I felt relieved of ending it, I still felt really alone. And empty. Have you felt that way?""

There it was, another heavy subject. I held back a sigh. I had to learn to answer questions like these. I decided to give it a try. ""I'll say I know what it feels like. To come to rely upon something that's not good for you,"" I said.

""Did you get rid of that thing?"" she asked.

I scoffed at that. ""Oh I did. Not with my own hands but one day I woke up and I just...didn't have to rely on that thing anymore.""

""That sounds impossible,"" Lenora said.

""I know. But it happened. There was a point in my life where I was convinced that I didn't deserve it and yet I got a chance to start over,"" I said. ""Even though what happened to me feels like a miracle now, it has really made me believe that...there are not a lot of things that are truly impossible.""

""This is why I want to live with you all,"" Lenora said. ""These things you say...they make me trust you. They give me hope. Even that advice you gave me at my apartment. No one agreed with that. My colleagues, even my own parents tried to make me stay with Clyde. But it was your words that gave me the courage to...take control of my life again."" She took a step forward and said with a determined look, ""I trust you. I know you won't do anything bad to me. The question is, do you trust me the same way?""

I have tried the Jimmy Deans or store brand sandwiches, but they are just so packed with sodium and other ingredients we can barely pronounce. So I wanted to make some and have them on hand when the craving hit. It also saves you money from stopping at the drive through or the fancy coffee shops in the morning that only charge an arm and a leg to top it all. 

If you are interested in making some for yourself here is the full recipe: [https://www.craftwithtammy.com/post/egg-cheese-english-muffin-sandwiches](https://www.craftwithtammy.com/post/egg-cheese-english-muffin-sandwiches)

1kvy4q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kvy4q8/ibsd_just_gone_after_suffering_for_20_years/,Ibs-D just gone after suffering for 20 years,"Hey so I feel like I can post this since I have been virtually symptom free for 10 months now. I'm not selling anything btw lol To preface, I suffered from IBS-D since the age of 12. I was hospitalized for severe GI pain and crazy bloating. Had to get CT scans done and all that. FOR 20 YEARS THE SYMPTOMS NEVER STOPPED. I would be in the bathroom 10-15 times a day, on really bad days even more. I would get the whole episode too with the blood pressure drops, sweats, repeated chills, severe abdominal cramping, thought I was going to pass out and die multiple times. I'd literally have my phone open some nights on the dial screen in case I felt myself falling out and needed to call 911/emergency services.

I have had colonoscopies and endoscopies done, multiple 24-hour urine tests, countless blood draws. They've checked me for super random and rare genetic conditions, different cancers, and all sorts of autoimmune conditions. Nothing ever came back conclusive. Only thing I got was lots of medical debt that had destroyed my credit and financial life to this day. I developed hemorrhoids at 20yo and stomach ulcers at 25yo. I hated life, hated food, and thought it would never end. Then 10 months ago I had a really bad episode, with the BP drop, chills, sweats, and severe cramping, the whole shebang. I was giving up, I gave zero shits (no pun intended lol) about what I ate anymore. 

So I started eating dairy again which had been a big no before and hadn't had it in years. I got yogurt first cus I used to love yogurt as a kid and it's cheap and easy to eat. Fast foward 10 months and eat a yogurt pretty much every day for breakfast. I havent had a single bad episode since. Don't get me wrong, I will still get the occasional bloating and heavy gas but it's *just that*, I still poop normally. And I *KNOW* what caused the stomach issues now, mostly cus I'll binge out on a bunch of junk food like candy and chips lol which I could never dream of doing before without serious pain. 

I'm still scared it'll return and still avoid certain things out of habit like raw veggies and too much tomato anything. But I literally use the bathroom 1-2 times a day now and it's *regular* like I know when I wake up, I'll need to take a shit and I won't have to take another till many hours later which is WILD to me. Mind you, I've tried what feels like every elimination diet before that and have always been into health and fitness. So it's not like I eat junk food 24/7. My only ""safe"" food was plain white rice with eggs and it's still one of favorites but I get to add veggies to it now lol

Like I'm sitting here drinking an iced coffee and having a  a croissant sandwich with it. The coffee alone would've for sure set off symptoms before but not anymore. My relationship with food is still a work in progress and I could really gain some weight but I'm still learning what foods I even like at 32 years old!

I *highly* doubt it was *just* the yogurt though but I do think it was a big contributor. My parents are awful people who should've never had children. I cut contact with my father many years ago and finally cut contact with my mother last year, very close to when my symptoms subsided. And even though life hasn't been the best financially and am still stressed tf out, I don't have IBS symptoms. I used to meditate, did yoga, all the things for stress in hopes it would ease my symptoms.

Anyways, just wanted to come here and say don't lose hope if you're at the end of your rope. I know what it feels like to be there and seriously never thought I'd see this day, the day I could *enjoy* food and not be in pain every. single. day. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my dog and I thank him everyday for that now. It's gonna sound corny but it really feels like I've been released from the shackles of IBS and that my life has truly, finally started (great, now I'm crying lol). 

I've been learning so much about myself since I don't have to constantly think about what I'm gonna eat and how much pain it will cause me or if there's a bathroom suitable enough for me to be in for 30-45 minutes if I decided to go out. It's funny, I still have the habit of going to the bathroom at work almost every hour cus it's what I'm used to and I'll go in and think ""wtf I'm doing in here? I don't even have to go"". I even started dating last winter and met a wonderful person in February and don't even think about how my belly is going to be when with them. I can finally be me. 

If you made it this far, thank you for coming to my TED talk lol you all got this. ",2,1748275546.0,ibs,0,1.0,False
1kvy2xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1kvy2xv/found_a_strange_marketplace_last_night/,Found a strange marketplace last night,"So it has been years since the last time I’ve realized i was dreaming while still in the dream. But last night, the experience was different- i had more control and stayed longer than ever before. Every time I felt like I was losing my grip on the dream world, I was able to push through the darkness and find it again. 
My dream would bring me to dead ends and I would imagine a way out (like crawling through a cabinet door to get somewhere else) 

Eventually I found myself in this strange marketplace. There were shops everywhere; almost all of them had floating red writing in a language I didn’t recognize over the doors. A guide found me and explained that the shops with the writing weren’t activated yet but were waiting for their dreamers to find this place. The guide brought me to a shop with writing and basically told me that I made it to this meeting place and that this was my special shop and i needed to go inside to activate it.

I was scared at first of getting trapped by it but after asking many questions and getting satisfactory answers, I went in. It was a bakery and coffee shop- it immediately felt like home. My thought was “of course this is my shop.” I didn’t get to stay long before waking up but the whole thing has stayed with me. 
I felt like I was shown what work would make me happy. It’s very different than what I’m doing now and what I’m in school to pursue. 
But working at Starbucks and baking for my friends  were places/activities that would consistently put me into flow state. I stopped working at Starbucks to find a better 9-5 job to meet the cost of living and am now also in school full time to help me get a high paying corporate job. I don’t even have time to bake anymore

But as a kid my dream was to open up a coffee shop and to live upstairs- as an adult, the work I’ve loved the most was making coffee at Starbucks. 
I had pretty much forgotten but this dream reminded me. I still have to meet the cost of living, but I think I’m going to take out my espresso machine and start baking again even if it’s just for me and my friends. ",1,1748275431.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

i pray for the men

who eat alone at diners

elbows on chipped formica,

coffee gone lukewarm,

eggs sweating under fluorescent light,

they stare into the distance

as if it owes them an apology.










i pray for the one

who once held a little girl

with sunlight in her hair,

who called him daddy

until he let pride take the wheel,

drove her straight into memory.

now he folds her drawings

like confession letters

he’s too proud to return.









i pray for the one

who found a soft bed,

a kind laugh,

a woman who made breakfast on sundays
and called his faults beautiful.

but he needed storm sirens,

not lullabies.

he walked out the door

looking for fire,

and burned his eyes out.









i pray for the shadow dodgers,

the jumpy men,

who flinch when life reaches for them.
men who don’t trust

anyone with the same blood

or the same bed.

men who keep running

even when no one’s chasing.









i don’t ask for much, lord.

just let them sleep one night

without dreaming of

what they could have been

if they’d just stayed

at the table

a little longer.

We’ve been friends since November. But really close since February. We talk on the phone for hours most days. Mondays after work we go hang out and eat or talk in the car and just chill for 3 or 4 hours. I do like him in a more than friends way, and he’s expressed interest as well, but we both agreed we have a lot to work on before anything like that. He was my favorite person. My safe space. 

Then 2 weeks ago it all went to hell. He wanted to cut back on communication because of some drama going on. I agreed we should. We both have a lot we should be focusing more on. The next day I was talking to a coworker and she told me what some dude she’s used to talk to said about him. I responded by saying something I shouldn’t have. Something he told me in confidence. Well turns out she still talks to this guy. So she told him what I said and him and his dad confronted him. (I said basically the guy and his dad have it out for him and have for a long time) 

He called me and confronted me about it and we agreed to meet after work so I could tell my side. He was so mad. Called me a backstabber, I betrayed him, just like he knew I would. Said I was retaliating because he wanted to cut back on communication. Said some really mean things that I hope were just out of anger. I cried and told him I would absolutely never do anything intentionally to hurt him. I get how he feels but I was not retaliating. He’s one of the most important people in my life. If I was retaliating why did I bring you lunch and a slice of my kids birthday cake today? We talked for hours. I asked him how I can fix it. In the end he said it would be forgivable if it wasn’t for the timing. It just seems suspicious happening right after he decided to cut back on talking. Now he’s cutting all communication. He said if the friendships meant to be it will work out. Then we went to get coffee and talked a bit more. When he got out the car I gave him a bag of gummy candies shaped like Shaq. Told him I bought them that weekend because we were talking about shaq the other day and it made me think of him and smile. He seemed so happy and surprised by it. We parted ways. Then he called me on my way home to talk more. 

After that it changed. He went cold. Saw him in the break room and I got the coldest “sup” ever. I couldn’t even respond. Next time I saw him he just loooked at me from across the room. Then he started avoiding eye contact. Saw him leaving down hall one time and he looked anywhere but at me. Got close and he turned down a hall. I said hey. He didn’t look, barely waved and as soon as I passed he went back to the main hall. That hurt. Saw him yesterday. Said hey. This time he looked at me and nodded and gave a forced half smile. I don’t know if that’s progress but it felt like it. 

But holy shit I miss his smile. I miss his laugh. I don’t like that he went cold. I don’t know how to fix this. I don’t know how we went from calling me after that talk, to going out of his way to avoid me. I bought his favorite candy bar at a vending machine when I got myself some skittles the other day and I just keep it in my backpack because I can’t give it to him. I hate going to work now. I don’t have him to talk to or look forward to. I want to cry when I think about him. How badly I broke his trust that this was the outcome. 

If anyone has any advice on patching things with him I’d appreciate it. I just don’t think he can go from the close bond/friendship we had to overnight hating me. I know somewhere in there he still cares and I want to reach that and start repairing what I screwed up. I just don’t know how. This is more painful than any breakup I’ve ever been through.

Currently cutting - 1600kcal a day + cardio (treadmill, shadowboxing at home)


Day 1 - 19/05 - Injection 1

Don't feel any different, which is normal. I have a migraine, but I don't think this is because of TRT. I think it's because I woke up at 4:30am. I'm also aggressively restricting calories to lose some weight. Plan is to get to 180lbs then restart weightlifting and recomp. I did get some warm hands, feet and face in the evening though. Like my hands were super hot and got these red, raised lumps on them that itched like crazy for about 30 minutes, then went away. 196lbs

Day 2 - 20/05

No change. The warm hands and face are gone. Felt a sense of calm, but this could honestly just be relief from finally being on treatment and knowing I'm not unfixable. 194lbs

Day 3 - 21/05

A bit tired today. Was kind of hoping I'd be an early responder, but this is just more of the usual fatigue. Spent half the day on the PC and half horizontal on the sofa watching YouTube shit on my phone. 193lbs

Day 4 - 22/05 - Injection 2

Slept for like 8-9 hours. so way more than usual. Still up and down all night pissing though, and still feel tired in the morning. Did my second injections. Still don't really feel any different, but this is expected. 191lbs

Day 5 - 23/05

Woke up pretty tired, despite about 8-9 hours sleep again. But went for a walk round the village shops and when I got home around 13:30, realized I wasn't completely physically shattered like I usually would be. Back aches slightly. Stayed mentally alert and switched on since and it's 17:36 now. Could be a placebo still, but I feel like I do when on amphetamine. Like fully awake and alert. But no jitteriness. Locked in, is the best way to describe it. Hope this continues tomorrow. 189lbs

Day 6 - 24/05

Woke up feeling tired again. 7.5 hours sleep. Wasn't tired until 10pm last night. No noticeable changes. Still have that more alert feeling during the day though. Almost as soon as I've finished my morning coffee, just bright eyed and awake all day. In a great pattern with sleep at the moment too. SAD lamp off at 18:00. Blue-light filters at 19:00. Take tablets at 19:30. Start getting tired at 20:00. Bed before 21:00 and asleep in 10-15 minutes. I haven't been able to do this for a long time. Always been wide awake until 23:00+, don't sleep much and wake up feeling like shit. So this is a nice change. Sounds dumb but I have alarms set up for everything, even when to eat. Makes tracking everything easy. 190lbs

Day 7 - 25/05

Woke up early, but wasn't massively tired. In fact, I started playing Monster Train 2 and basically played it all day. I played it so long my wrist started hurting. I haven't played a game this long and solidly without getting bored or tired for ages. Not feeling any profound effects or bursting with energy yet, but being able to just do something I enjoy without needing to lie down is quite a significant change for me. 192lbs

I play video games here & there, but recently it's been difficult cause games aren't fun these days like they used to be (probs getting older).

I like some TV shows. My favorite shows are Fringe and Dexter. I'd love to chat about basically anything, especially people that don't take themselves too seriously!

I need to preface that I do not have any official diagnosis and I'm constantly swinging in a cycle of doubting myself-->self dx-->convince myself I am a NT. 


I'm on my 2nd semester of Degree and it's just...really overhelming. Everything is piled up on everything and I feel really distressed and I get barely anything done. My overdue works are adding up while the ones that's nearing their deadlines doesn't budge an inch. 


Everynight I just feel like crying but I don't even understand why and I feel really tired and sleepy 24/7. I could sleep for 11  hours straight and woke up feeling tired for the entire day. Most of the foods I eat just feel like lumps of flavoured coagulated soil I need to eat so I won't pass out. Some of the food I do eat won't last the entire day but I'm not in the mood again to eat it more frequently. Coffee just won't hit the same, I could drink a cup or 2 of coffee and I would still fall asleep. I could barely focus on anything as I would spend most of my energy and time telling myself to focus on the task instead of doing the task. Sometimes I would open up games/media social to give some dopamine shots but I end up either spending the entire time with them or feeling guilty for opening them and hate myself for it.


Either way my works won't budge at this point and I have lots and LOTS of group assignment. I don't want to be that one group member who don't contribute to anything yet I feel like I'm the one free riding everyone in all of the assignment and I feel really bad about it. Plus I enrolled here with the funds my parents set aside from their work(I don't have any student loans) so I feel more obligated to so my best here but it feels like I don't give any at all. 


Some of my friends and even lecturers do tell me I can make my work faster and easier by utilizing AI. Which is honestly is true but I feel like I don't learn nor do anything anything with AI. It's not helping me how I feel like AI is eating up lots of energy for no reason. Which honestly feel kinda crazy for me since I am taking an CS course and most of my peers and lecturers seems to be thrilled to learn them.


I'm scared of getting diagnosed, how would everyone around me feel? I don't have any family members diagnosed with adhd nor autism. Will people look at me differently once I'm diagnosed? I don't know how much better does the community here see me. Dear lord, everytime I hear people ramble something along the line of *If [name] can do it, why y'all can't do it? All of us have the same thing to do yet some of you guys can't manage your time well* It feels realy infuriating heck sometimes sadden me, I feel mad yet deep down I tell myself the same thing again,again and again. I think that's what hearing the same sentence throughout grow up(I remember hearing this since 8 years old but my memory is barely working so I don't trust them much).


It saddens me since everytime I try to search advice online and even most of my peers even advice me to have more compassion towards myself yet I failed even the most things.


Anyways sorry for the wonky English. I type this one go so I didn't read this more aside from skimming through what I typed for typos. Here some cat pics I added to lighten this post up.

إذا كنت تفكر تتعلم اللغة اليابانية — سواء كنت مبتدئ أو عندك شوية خبرة — راح أكون سعيدة نتواصل مع بعض!

أنا من اليابان وأعيش في الدوحة، وأحب أساعد الناس يتعلمون اللغة اليابانية من خلال الأنمي، والمانجا، والحوار اليومي، ومواضيع الثقافة بطريقة ممتعة ومريحة.

أدرّس باللغة الإنجليزية فقط (ما أتكلم عربي)، فحياك تتواصل معاي بالإنجليزي — أو بالياباني إذا حاب تجرب 😉 لا تستحي!  
ملاحظة: أدرّس فقط الكبار من عمر ١٦ سنة وفوق.

🧑‍🏫 عادة ألتقي مع الأشخاص بشكل فردي علشان أقدر أركّز على أهدافك واهتماماتك، لكن إذا تفضل تتعلم مع صديق، ما في مشكلة أبداً — أقدر أعدّل طريقة الدرس حسب رغبتك.

أحب نبدأ بلقاء قهوة بسيط في كافيه لطيف في الدوحة، علشان نتعرف على بعض ونتكلم عن أهدافك ونشوف إذا نرتاح للتعلّم سوا.

وإذا تحس بعدك مو مرتاح تقابل شخص جديد، عادي جداً تجيب معاك صديق أو أحد من أهلك — أهم شي تكون مرتاح.

✨ أنا بنت يابانية، وغالباً ألقى سهولة بالتواصل مع البنات اللي يحبون الأنمي، الجمال، الموسيقى أو الدردشة عن الحياة في اليابان.  
بس أكيد أرحب بالجميع، مهما كان الجنس، طالما فيه احترام ورغبة حقيقية في تعلّم اللغة والثقافة اليابانية.

⚠️ ملاحظة بسيطة:  
هذا مو إعلان تجاري — فقط رسالة ودّية للناس اللي حابين يتعلمون ويتواصلون عن طريق اللغة اليابانية.  
وما أرد على أي رسالة غير واضحة أو غير محترمة. شكراً لتفهمكم!



If you’ve been thinking about learning Japanese — whether you’re just starting out or already have some experience — I’d be happy to connect with you!

I’m a native Japanese speaker based in Doha, and I love helping others explore the language through anime, manga, everyday conversation, and cultural topics in a relaxed, fun way.

I teach in English only (I don’t speak Arabic), so feel free to message me in English — or in Japanese if you’d like to give it a try. Don’t be shy!  
Please note: I only teach adults (ages 16 and up).

🧑‍🏫 I usually meet with people one-on-one, since it’s easier to focus on what *you* want to learn. But if you'd prefer to study with a friend, that’s totally fine too — I’m happy to adjust the style to suit you.

If you're interested, I usually like to start with a casual coffee chat in a nice café in Doha. It’s a simple, friendly way to get to know each other, talk about your interests and goals, and see if it feels like a good fit.

And if you're unsure about meeting someone for the first time, you’re absolutely welcome to bring a friend or family member — your comfort always comes first.

✨ I’m a female native speaker, and I often find it especially easy to connect with women who enjoy anime, beauty, music, or relaxed chats about life in Japan.  
That said, I truly welcome anyone — regardless of gender — as long as there’s mutual respect and a genuine interest in Japanese language and culture.

⚠️ Just a small note:  
This isn’t a commercial ad — it’s simply a friendly message for people who sincerely want to learn and connect through Japanese.  
To keep this space safe, I don’t respond to inappropriate or unclear messages. Thanks so much for understanding!

  
Thank you for reading.

1kvxlwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1kvxlwo/im_going_to_quit_caffeine_need_advice/,"Im going to quit caffeine, need advice","Hello everyone. 

Today, I made some calculations, and realized that my daily caffeine intake is way higher than I had thought. Because, the 'cups' I have are actually mugs, if you know what I mean.

I've drank coffee literally every day since I was ~16, I am soon 19. Always 2-3 cups per day, some days even 4-5.

But, to the point.

I've decided to first reduce my caffeine intake, by simply using smaller cups, which are quite small, around 100 ml, instead of those over 300 ml cups. (Not American, I don't know how ounces work)

Then, gradually reduce my caffeine intake to zero. Or at least generally zero. Coffee-drinking is very integrated into the culture of my country, so I may be unable to quit 'fully'. 

So, couple questions to you, who have maybe already quit caffeine

1. How long, should I use to reduce the intake gradually, to avoid the worst kind of withdrawls? Should it take week, 2 weeks, month? And how much I should reduce? Is it too brave to immediately cut the amount in half?

2. What have been the best consequenses of quitting caffeine to you? I've already read about them, but wouldn't mind hearing more, you know, to keep me motivated to get trough with this. 

3. Any other advice you have, this is my first time seriously trying this.

Thank you 🙏

The cocoa beverage was as delicious as one might expect

The coffee was a red pouch of Taster's Choice that managed to not dry mold, and it paired well with the sugar and creamer. Enjoyable enough, even as someone who isn't a fan of coffee for the most part

The main itself was in better overall condition than the previous one and had more flavor, but due to the retort pouch delaminating (especially when boiling) I did not consume too much of it

The wheat snack bread had a much better flavor than the other one, although it still dried the mouth out. I don't know if that's just how these were back in the Mid 2000s or if that's a result of something in the bread  going off after 20 years

The Creamsicle cookie was amazing. I don't know why they got rid of it

Yet, beneath the stillness, I sensed a current—energy like water through underground pipes.

Agnes led me to the gymnasium. Someone had painted a large circle on the floor in white paint that smelled like crushed bone and sage. ""Secondary crossing,"" she said. ""Smaller than the one at your store, but it connects to the same network. Tonight, when the barrier thins, all three points will sync up.""

""And that's when Billy Hawk makes his move.""

""He's fed on boundary energy for months, getting stronger. Tonight, he'll try to tear the crossings wide open. Permanent access for anything that wants through."" Agnes opened her bag, producing Thomas Whitehorse's journal. A page I hadn't seen showed three circles connected by lines, symbols marking locations around each. ""The original guardians,"" she said, pointing to the symbols. ""Three families, three bloodlines, three crossing points. The Whitehorses, the Martinez family, and the Crow Feathers.""

""Your family guards a crossing too?""

""The school crossing. A hundred years."" She smiled grimly. ""Why else would I know so much about your situation?""

""And the Martinez family?""

""Community center. But Elena Martinez died last winter; her daughter moved to Denver. No guardian there anymore."" The pieces fit, forming a pattern I didn't like.

""So the community center crossing is unguarded.""

""Ten months. That's why Billy Hawk is so strong now—feeding off an unprotected boundary."" Agnes walked to the painted circle, placing small objects at specific points—carved bones, herb bundles, stones polished by decades. ""Tonight, we stabilize all three simultaneously. Me here, you at the Dollar Tree, and..."" She paused, uncomfortable.

""And?""

""Someone needs to be at the community center. Someone with the sight and the blood.""

""There's no one else?""

""There's you."" I stared, understanding dawning like cold water in my gut.

""You want me to guard two crossings at once.""

""The community center crossing is active only for about an hour, 11 PM to midnight. If we keep it stable during that window, Billy Hawk can't use it as an anchor point.""

""And if we can't?"" Agnes didn't answer immediately. She finished placing her objects, each humming with barely contained energy. ""If we fail, Faith becomes a permanent gateway. Every hungry spirit, lost soul, every predator between worlds—direct access.""

""Great. No pressure.""

We spent two hours on the plan. I'd start my Dollar Tree shift as usual, follow routine until 10:45 PM. Slip out the back, drive to the community center (Agnes left items). At 11 PM sharp, activate the temporary boundary stabilization spell she taught me. At midnight, return to the Dollar Tree for the real confrontation with Billy Hawk. ""The spell won't hold long,"" Agnes warned. ""You'll be vulnerable while casting. If Billy Hawk realizes...""

""He'll come for me first.""

""Probably.""

Agnes drove me back to the Dollar Tree around 8 PM, time to prepare for what felt like the longest night of my life. Harvey waited in the parking lot, his usual calm replaced by raw anxiety. ""You sure about this, Tyler?"" he asked. ""There might be another way.""

""What other way?""

Harvey looked older than I'd ever seen him, the weight of decades finally catching up. ""The blood debt. It doesn't have to be you who pays it.""

""What do you mean?""

""I've guarded this crossing thirty-seven years. Seen three generations of Whitehorses come and go. Maybe it's time for someone else to take the permanent shift."" I understood his offer—my chest tightened with gratitude and horror, equally.

""Harvey, no. This isn't your responsibility.""

""Isn't it? I hired you knowing what it meant. Knew your bloodline, knew what Billy Hawk would eventually demand."" He handed me the store key, fingers shaking slightly. ""If something goes wrong tonight, if the spell doesn't work, remember there's always a choice about who pays the price.""

Inside, I performed the normal opening routine with mechanical precision—counting the register, checking inventory, reviewing rules. Tonight, the rules felt different; not guidelines for survival, but a ritual performed for the last time. At 10:30, the first Halloween customers arrived. Normal people, doing normal things, utterly unaware their world might change forever in hours.

At 10:45, I locked the front door, slipped out the back. The drive to the community center took seven minutes—seven minutes during which anything could have entered the unguarded Dollar Tree. The community center squatted on Main Street, a concrete toad, its modern architecture jarring against historic neighbors. Agnes had left a duffle bag hidden behind the dumpster, filled with items for the spell.

Inside, the building felt wrong. Not actively malevolent, like the Dollar Tree could be, but... hollow. As if something vital had been carved out, never replaced. I found the spot Agnes marked—dead center of the old church altar, now industrial carpet and fluorescent lighting. The crossing, invisible to normal sight, felt like a wound in the air.

At exactly 11 PM, I began the ritual Agnes taught me. The words were Lakota, phrases from my great-grandfather's journal, yet familiar on my tongue—genetic memory made audible. As I spoke, I scattered the salt, cornmeal, and crushed sage mixture in a wide circle. The effect was immediate. The air above the carpet shimmered like heat waves. Through it, I saw... somewhere else. A vast prairie under a starless sky, figures moving like shadows given form.

That's when Billy Hawk found me. He didn't appear gradually. One moment alone, the next he stood at my circle's edge, his form more solid, more defined than ever. ""Clever boy,"" he said, his voice echoing from multiple directions. ""But you can't guard three crossings with two people.""

""Watch me.""

""I am watching. I'm also watching your friend Agnes struggle at the school. Did she tell you what happens when a guardian fails?"" Billy Hawk gestured; the air shimmered again. This time, I saw the high school gymnasium—Agnes kneeling inside her painted circle, dark shapes pressing the boundaries she'd created. She chanted, but exhaustion etched every line of her body.

""She's done this fifty years,"" Billy Hawk continued conversationally. ""The crossing work ages you faster. Look at her hands."" I looked. Agnes's hands were translucent, like Margaret's—becoming more spirit than flesh, worn down by decades of boundary work.

""That's the guardian job,"" Billy Hawk said. ""Slow consumption. Your great-grandfather lasted twenty years. Your grandfather, fifteen. Your father tried to run—the crossing took him all at once.""

""You're lying.""

""Am I? Check your family photos. Look how your great-grandfather aged in his last five years. Look at your grandfather's medical records. Heart failure at forty-eight, just like your father."" My ritual circle wavered as doubt crept into my concentration. Billy Hawk smiled, his features briefly resolving into the young man he'd been before the crossing changed him. ""I'm not the monster, Tyler. The crossing is. It's fed on your family for a century, and it won't stop."" He stepped closer to the circle's edge. ""But I can end it. Let me tear the boundaries wide open, let the crossings merge permanently, and no one else is consumed piece by piece.""

""And let every predator in the spirit world access Faith?""

""Some prices are worth paying to end a greater evil."" For a moment, I almost believed him. The alternative—watching my life drain year by year, as it had from Agnes, my father, grandfather—seemed worse than any chaos Billy Hawk might unleash. Then I remembered the three synchronized entities from the Dollar Tree—hungry black eyes, predatory amusement. Remembered the thing wearing Harvey's voice, luring me into the storage room.

""No,"" I said, pouring more energy into the spell. ""Find another way.""

Billy Hawk's expression hardened. ""Then you'll pay the price your family owes. Tonight."" He lunged, hitting my circle's boundary like physical force. The impact sent shockwaves through the air; something inside me tore as I struggled to maintain the spell. Midnight was fifteen minutes away. I had to hold the crossing stable until then, no matter what Billy Hawk threw. The real fight had just begun.

Billy Hawk's assault came in waves—physical force, cracking the air like glass; then psychological pressure, like ice picks in my skull. Each attack weakened the spell; I felt the community center crossing grow unstable beneath my feet. ""Twelve minutes,"" I muttered, checking my watch, maintaining the Lakota chant. ""Just hold for twelve more minutes."" Billy Hawk circled the boundary like a predator testing a fence, his form shifting between the young man he'd been and the twisted thing he'd become.

""You feel it, don't you? The crossing pulling at your life force. Every second you maintain this spell, it takes a little more."" He was right. My hands developed the same translucence as Agnes's; a hollow ache filled my chest, absent an hour ago. The guardian work wasn't just demanding—it was consuming. ""Better to burn out fast than fade away slow,"" Billy Hawk continued. ""Let me end this, Tyler. Free your family from this curse.""

""What about the people in Faith? What happens when every hungry spirit can walk through town like their personal feeding ground?""

""Collateral damage. Your family paid the price for this town's safety a century. Maybe it's time the town paid its own bills."" The community center crossing pulsed beneath me, sending tremors through the building. Dust rained from ceiling tiles; car alarms wailed in the distance as the disturbance rippled outward. My phone buzzed. Text from Agnes: *School crossing stabilized. Need help?* I couldn't spare energy to text back, but her message gave hope. One crossing secure, one holding, one more to go.

At 11:55, Billy Hawk changed tactics. Instead of attacking the circle, he pulled power from the crossing itself—drawing spiritual energy upward like a twisted reverse whirlpool. The effect was immediate, horrifying—the air's shimmer became a gaping wound. Through it, I saw dozens of figures gathering on the other side. Not just lost spirits or hungry shadows. These were things never human—entities with too many limbs, faces that couldn't decide their shape. They pressed against the barrier, sensing the weakness Billy Hawk created.

""You see?"" Billy Hawk said, his voice everywhere now. ""The crossing wants to be opened. It's tired of being constrained, rationed, controlled. Let it be what it was meant to be."" My protective circle began to crack, literally—hairline fractures in the carpeting, spreading from the crossing point like a spider web. Through those cracks, I saw the same starless prairie glimpsed before, now crowded with waiting predators. Two minutes until midnight. Two minutes until I could abandon the spell, race back to the Dollar Tree for the final confrontation.

That's when I heard my father's voice. Clear, calm, from directly behind me. ""Tyler.""

""Son, you need to listen."" I turned, nearly losing control of the spell, and saw him standing at the community center's main room edge. Robert Whitehorse looked exactly as I remembered—work shirt, jeans, the same serious expression worn teaching me to change a tire or balance a checkbook.

""Dad?""

""Don't let Billy Hawk fool you,"" he said, moving closer. ""The guardian job doesn't have to consume you. There's another way.""

Billy Hawk snarled, his form less stable. ""Impossible. You're dead. The crossing took you years ago.""

""The crossing took my body,"" my father agreed. ""But not my choice. It can't take Tyler's choice either."" My father walked to my circle's edge; he cast no shadow. ""The blood debt isn't dying for the crossing, son. It's living for it. Becoming part of the boundary.""

""What does that mean?""

""It means you don't fight the guardian work. Embrace it, let it change you gradually, not all at once. Agnes's done it wrong fifty years, fighting consumption instead of directing it."" Billy Hawk lunged again; my father stepped between us. The spirits collided—a flash of silver light, afterimages burned across my vision.

""Now, Tyler!"" my father shouted. ""While he's distracted!"" I poured every remaining bit of energy into the spell, feeling something fundamental shift in my relationship with the crossing. Instead of fighting its pull, I channeled energy back into the boundary—creating a feedback loop that strengthened me and the barrier. The effect was immediate. Floor cracks sealed, air shimmer stabilized, hungry entities retreated from an impermeable wall.

At exactly midnight, the community center crossing went dormant, sealed until next Halloween.

Billy Hawk separated from my father, both spirits flickering like dying candle flames. ""This isn't over,"" he snarled. ""The Dollar Tree crossing is still active. Still vulnerable.""

""Then I guess I'd better get back there,"" I said, grabbing Agnes's duffle bag, heading for the exit.

""Tyler,"" my father called. ""Remember what I showed you. The crossing doesn't have to be your enemy."" I nodded, ran for my truck, leaving two spirits to finish whatever battle brewed between them for years.

The drive back took six minutes that felt like hours. The parking lot was empty, but every light inside blazed. Dark shapes moved through aisles like sharks in an aquarium. Harvey's truck sat beside the building—he'd come back despite my orders. I found him inside, behind the counter, shotgun across his knees, grim expression on his weathered face.

""Couldn't stay home,"" he said, not looking up. ""This is my responsibility too."" The store was full of them—a dozen entities, various sizes, malevolence, drawn by the Halloween thinning. But they weren't attacking. They waited.

""Where's Billy Hawk?"" I asked.

""Storage room,"" Harvey replied. ""Been back there twenty minutes, doing something to the main crossing. Whatever it is, it's shaking the whole building."" As if summoned, a tremor ran through the Dollar Tree, rattling products, flickering lights. In the storage room, I heard Billy Hawk chanting—a language predating human civilization.

""He's trying to tear the crossing wide open,"" I realized. ""Permanent access, just like he threatened."" Harvey stood, checking the shotgun's load. ""Rock salt and sage,"" he said. ""Won't kill him, but it'll hurt enough.""

""Harvey, no. This is what he wants—one of us to go back, disrupt whatever protection the storage room still has.""

""So what do you suggest?""

I thought of my father's words—embracing the work, not fighting. Agnes's translucent hands. The century-long price my family paid. ""I'm trying something different."" I walked to the store's center, where the main crossing ran beneath pharmacy and automotive. The other entities watched with hungry curiosity, none moved to interfere.

Kneeling on the linoleum, I placed hands flat, reached out with the same spiritual sense used at the community center. The crossing was there, deep, powerful. Instead of controlling it, protecting myself, I opened myself to its influence. The sensation—diving into a river of liquid starlight. Power flowed through, around me, transforming me cellularly. My connection to the physical world loosened. Instead of fighting, I used that looseness to merge partially with the crossing itself.

From this new perspective, I saw Faith's entire spiritual ecosystem—three crossing points, the spell network Agnes and predecessors wove, scars left by decades of activity. And I saw Billy Hawk in the storage room, his form blazing with stolen energy, tearing reality apart. I reached through the crossing, grabbed him.

Billy Hawk screamed as I pulled him from his sabotage, into direct contact with the crossing's core. For a moment, we were suspended in that starlight river—two spirits grappling for control of forces neither fully understood. ""You can't stop me,"" he snarled, form shifting. ""I've fed on boundary energy for months. I'm stronger than any guardian.""

""You're not fighting a guardian,"" I replied, crossing power flowing through my words. ""You're fighting the crossing itself."" I pressed deeper into the current, letting it transform me further. My physical body became a distant concern as I embraced my role—a living conduit between worlds. Billy Hawk fought, but he tried to dominate something meant to be partnered with, not conquered. The starlight river swept him away, carrying his screaming form back to whatever realm spawned him. As he disappeared, his stolen energy dispersed back into the crossing's natural flow.

I opened my eyes—lying on the Dollar Tree floor, surrounded by Harvey and Agnes, who must have arrived while I was merged. The other entities vanished, driven back by the boundary's restoration. ""How do you feel?"" Agnes asked, helping me sit up. I took inventory. My hands still slightly translucent, the hollow ache replaced by... completion. As if I'd found a missing piece.

""Different,"" I said honestly. ""But not consumed. Not dying."" Harvey smiled—the first genuine relief I'd seen from him in weeks. ""Your father figured it out, didn't he? How to be a guardian without being destroyed."" I nodded, understanding settling into place. The blood debt wasn't death—it was transformation. Choosing to become something more than human to protect the boundary. As the sun rose over Faith, painting prairie grass gold, I realized my night shift at the Dollar Tree had just begun.

One Year Later.

Harvey retired in March, as the prairie showed first hints of green. He handed over the keys with a grin I'd never seen—a man who'd carried a burden forty years, finally finding someone trustworthy to share it. ""Take care of the place,"" he said, loading fishing gear into a suspiciously new truck. ""But don't let it take care of you."" I understood now. Consumed versus transformed—it came down to choice. The daily decision to partner with the crossing, not fight or surrender.

Agnes stopped by that evening, carrying wine that probably cost more than I made in a week. ""Celebration,"" she said, settling into the folding chair behind the counter. ""First time in fifty years I've had a true partner, not someone I was trying to keep alive.""

""How's the school crossing?""

""Quiet. Cooperative. The spirits know we're working together now—they follow old agreements instead of testing boundaries."" She poured wine into two coffee mugs—the only drinking vessels the store offered. ""Your sister called me yesterday."" I paused updating inventory. Marlena called less since my transformation, conversations stilted, strange, as the gulf widened.

""What did she want?""

""To know if you were still human."" Agnes sipped her wine, studying my face over the mug's rim. ""I told her you were more human than you'd ever been. Just not the same kind you used to be."" That was probably the most accurate description. I still had thoughts, feelings, memories—still cared about the same things. But I also had awareness beyond the physical, responsibilities connecting me to spiritual currents beneath reality's surface.

My reflection synchronized around six months. Food tasted normal again around the same time, though I needed less. Sleep remained fragmentary, but dreams weren't disorienting—they were information, updates from the crossing network across the Great Plains. The customer base evolved too. By day, the Dollar Tree served Faith's normal population—ranchers buying motor oil, families stocking school supplies, teenagers spending allowance on candy and energy drinks. But at night, the store attracted a different clientele.

Lost spirits still came through, but now moved with purpose, not confusion. The crossing stabilized enough that most knew exactly where they were going, what they needed to do. My job shifted from survival to traffic management—ensuring spiritual travelers didn't interfere or linger too long. Occasionally, something genuinely dangerous tested boundaries—a hungry entity, a predator who hadn't gotten the message about Faith's new defenses. But these encounters felt less like life-or-death battles, more like a bouncer dealing with troublemakers. The crossing itself became an active partner in maintaining order.

The rules evolved into guidelines—flexible principles adapting to each situation, not rigid commandments. I still kept Harvey's original list in my shirt pocket, more a reminder of how far we'd come than actual instructions. Agnes finished her wine, gathered her things to leave. ""Your grandfather would be proud,"" she said, pausing at the door. ""He hoped someone in your bloodline would figure out the cooperative approach.""

After she left, I walked through the empty store, checking day shift had properly stocked shelves, organized displays. Normal retail work, performed by someone sensing spiritual currents beneath Faith like underground rivers. At 11:47, I locked the front door, prepared for another night maintaining the boundary. The crossing hummed quietly in the background—a sound like distant singing only I could hear.

Tomorrow, my day shift replacement arrives—Harvey's nephew, a recent college graduate thinking he's just taking a retail job for student loans. I'd train him like Harvey trained me—starting with basics, gradually introducing Faith's deeper mysteries. The cycle continues, but now it's a choice instead of a curse.

And that, I'd learned, made all the difference.",1,1748273999.0,Ruleshorror,1,1.0,False
1kvxh10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEET/comments/1kvxh10/neetism_is_real_freedom/,NEETism is real Freedom.,"I've been thinking on this one for a while, fellow NEETS. and my conclusion is that being a NEET is the best possible thing that could have happened. 

The simple why of it is explained by the fact that I find myself so incredibly disappointed and let down by almost everything these days. 

And the more I come to think about it, the more I find that my disappointment isn't far fetched or unfounded. 

Food used to taste better, social connections used to feel like they gave more, hard work had *actual* rewards and the world seemed just a bit more happy/innocent. 

I know nostalgia can give you rose tinted glasses, so that's why I had to really think on these things so hard. But it's true- food was cheaper, we had cheaper, nicer housing- options to go places were very much available, a.k.a third places. I felt like my conversations held weight and people valued time- and there was a really bright promise of having a good life ahead of me if i worked hard. Resturants actually served good food and were nice to go out to- theaters weren't a wallet emptying experience of trash and low decorum. 

The swimming pools were clean, fun and well regulated. We all had our share of problems, but it was a time where you could put a little elbow grease into something and fix it. Politics were not the end of the world every time they happened. 

Religion was not a widespread division creator. We had modest, hardworking people with actual morals and ethics that treated eachother the way they wanted to be treated, for the most part. Things had quality, not *quantity.* you could buy things and have them last years with guarantees on repair if they had an issue.

And of course, everything done wasn't for 15 minutes of limelight, or shock value for the next big scandal that follows the values of ""any publicity is good publicity."" 

So, what I'm all building up to here, isn't neccesarily that I was lied to, so much as that things rapidly changed so hard that what I grew up with considering ideals, values and how I looked at and interacted with the world no longer worked. 

I find the world I live in today has an unfettered love for fast and cheap production. Decorum has no place among the people- third spots are trashy, unclean and generally unfathomably unpleasant due to how the people there hold themselves.

The last time I walked into a coffee shop and smiled at something funny, I was immediately assaulted by shock and awe political bluster while just trying to enjoy coffee. Media constantly spouts the world is aflame when it's more reasonably not- media has degenerated in quality overall too. Movies, books, video games, videos, art, etc.

 I nearly hesitate to say this, but the last federally funded art school project at the local museum on a white pedestal in the main room was painted sticks and tin cans, discarded laundry detergent bottles and splashed paint. It was pretty terrible, by normal artistic standards. I know art is subjective, but it what this was felt like a mockery. 

If I haven't already mentioned it, food has become worse while price has increased massively. Usual staples taste awful while things like meat keep seeing massive percentage increases in price. I miss the days where my cooking felt great because the ingredients were of a high quality. Now, 5 dollar strawberry cases all have mold in them and getting potatoes nearly breaks the bank for a small bag. 

Not that affording things is easy. Every job I ever went to felt like it was paying a pittance after I'd gotten out of college. I worked hard, I did what I was told was right- and my reward was layoffs due to insufficent budget, employers lying about employment length of the job, mistrust, micromanagement and management that would often break the rules just to put me down and make me feel bad. Every time I've left a job, It's always made me feel better that I don't have to engage with such insanity, but I was always left wondering what I could have done better. 

Now I know that's an impossible dream. There's no way I could have fufilled those psychotic demands and while it's shocking- I've come to realize that being a NEET is where I find my true freedom from all this disappointment. 

What is sad about it, is that I feel that it could perhaps be dampened or even negated, if only people weren't so incredibly crass and apathetic. 9/10 times when I speak today, I feel my words aren't valued. People say to just ignore those who don't fit your vibe, but what am I to do when a massive part of the population fits in with the modus operandi of the aforementioned or aggrivating things like the concept of ""brainrot""? 

I feel like I have a lot to offer as a person, as a human being- but at the same time, I'm so reluctant to want to speak to people. I've been let down so many times in the aspect of kinship. Sometimes it's simply because we don't connect. But other times, I find i'm just completely put off by the fact that there seems to be a genuine lack of emotional depth, or near satire levels of emotional extremes displayed- or having to deal with my dialogue being discarded if it isn't hip or trendy enough. Sometimes if I'm not 100% political or religious in my topics, that's also the death of relations. 

And as I do keep silent, I find i tend to listen more. And a lot of people tend to say a wide range of things that make me utterly want to speak less, due to how little civility and kindness there is. 

I find that not working is fine, because there's nothing to gain from it anymore. I gain no deeper understanding of myself, no real monetary benefit. Jobs don't carry respect like they used to unless they're incredibly high profile. 

I find that, being at home and making my own things, working on my own projects is preferrable to having to bother with an early barrage of traffic and wake up times my body doesn't work well with. 

I find I like the quiet now. No rabblerousing, no need to engage with the rampant uptick of doomsayers spouting how this and that will be the next death of us all- tending to my garden or enjoying dark, rainy days is so much more preferable to being sat at a desk or standing behind a grocery line till, doing the same monotonous thing over and over again for the pleasure of someone I'll likely never meet face to face. 

I've even begun trying out a stratagem of making it so people have to put in the effort first if they want to genuinely contact me. I've discovered through NEET life that I have that inherent worth. That's also something that's massively widespread these days too- if you're not on call 24/7 for someone, they're liable to drop you for the next fish in the sea. So i've learnt- why bother? 

I've stopped going to resturants and bars because I can cook and brew and pour better at home. I prefer my own company- I like myself and it never leads to petty arguements or drama. There's no more being ghosted on plans- if i want to swim, I just go to the beach. I'll take that over the petri-dish swimming pool anyday. The net has all the movies I could ever want-

There's just no need to engage with it all anymore. Doing so only leads to frustration and inner turmoil with ""should've"" and ""could've""s that bind the soul. 

The only thing I miss out on truthfully, is Love. But that too has been warped and changed since adolescence and again, with the general state of decorum- the apathy, the way people carry themselves- I'm not so sure I'd want to be a part that anymore. (However, to those who are genuine in their ways, I truly admire you.) I know I'm not desirable as a NEET, but if by some miracle there was a chance, I'd likely still be worried i'd be left behind for some better prospect- or that were it to come to pass, my child would be born into the same kind of problematic world. This is a bit of a painful realization, but probably for the best, especially considering everything else. 

So yeah, that's how I feel about being a NEET. It was a gift to truly live life and not be shackled by the utter madness that has consumed ideology, industry and personality. It's been scary, jarring and absolutely filled with trials and tribulations both social and professional, getting to this point, but I'm finally here. 

Now I can just focus on being Happy. ",5,1748273942.0,NEET,2,1.0,False

There were exactly seven cracks in locker 318. Jas had counted them every morning for the past three years—two chipped lines near the top hinge, one long scar running down the middle like a vein, and four spiderwebbed fractures around the dent where Logan Hayes once slammed it shut… right in her face.
Not literally. He’d never hit her. Not on purpose, anyway.
But his words? Those landed hard. Sharp, smug, surgical. Always loud enough for others to hear. Always aimed at the softest parts she worked the hardest to hide.
Her reflection in the locker wasn’t doing her any favors either—frizzy bun, hoodie stretched across her chest, yesterday’s eyeliner faded into a vague raccoon haze. Whatever. She didn’t come to school to impress anyone. Least of all him.
She shifted her bag over her shoulder, trying not to wince as the strap pressed into her collarbone. Her back was already sore from closing the diner last night, and the double shift on Friday was already looming. She hadn’t responded to her manager’s 2:11 a.m. text begging for coverage. She was still deciding whether the overtime was worth the extra shift—and the migraine.
“Yo! Monroe!”
Her name, loud and laughing, cut through the hallway din.
Jas exhaled slowly through her nose.
Logan fucking Hayes.
She didn’t turn. Not right away. But the weight of his voice dragged her gaze back like gravity. He was leaning against his locker with that same shit-eating grin he wore like a badge, surrounded by his pack—Jax, Micah, and Drew. The golden boys of Jefferson High.
They looked like a goddamn sports drink commercial. She looked like she hadn’t slept in two days. Which was accurate.
“Did the hallway shrink,” Logan called, “or is it just you, Biggie J?”
A few people laughed. Jas turned, slow and deliberate, and locked eyes with him.
“You know,” she said, voice razor-sharp, “I actually read somewhere that people who joke about others’ weight are usually compensating for having a small—”
“Personality?” Logan offered, smirking. “Because you’ve got one of those, too.”
“Wow,” she said flatly. “Did your mommy teach you that one, or did it come free with your sixth concussion?”
Jax barked a laugh. Micah wheezed.
Logan didn’t flinch. He never did. But his eyes held hers for a beat longer than they should have. That look again. Not cruel. Not kind. Something else. Something Jas refused to name.
The bell rang before she could lob another comeback. She shouldered past him without flinching, her voice tight as she muttered, “Try harder next time, Hayes.”
Behind her, his voice trailed with teasing amusement. “See you in fifth, Monroe.”
Fifth period was always the worst.
It wasn’t the subject—she was good at trig, even when the numbers blurred from lack of sleep. It wasn’t even the teacher, who smelled like bitter coffee and wore cardigans with elbow patches like he was stuck in a movie from the nineties.
It was Logan Hayes.
Because for the third year in a row, by some twisted cosmic joke or maybe an act of pure administrative sadism, Logan was seated directly behind her.
Every damn day.
Jas slid into her desk and kept her eyes on the board, ignoring the thud of Logan dropping into his chair behind her. She barely had her mechanical pencil ready before the toe of his boot gently kicked her chair leg. Not hard—just enough to say I’m here. I see you.
She exhaled. Said nothing.
Tap. Tap. Tap.
The eraser of his pencil bounced against her shoulder.
“Your bra strap’s showing,” he whispered low. “Not that I mind.”
Jas didn’t turn around.
“Is that your version of a compliment, or are you just sexually repressed?”
He chuckled. “I mean, if you’re offering therapy, I’m open to it.”
She spun around this time—just for a second, just long enough to glare. “I’m offering duct tape. For your mouth.”
“Mm. Kinky.”
“Hayes, I swear to God—”
“Miss Monro,” Mr. Dorsey called from the front. “Is there a problem?”
“No, sir,” Jas said, straightening. “Just dealing with an invasive species.”
Laughter rippled through the classroom. Logan leaned back in his seat like he hadn’t just baited her into another detention-worthy exchange.
But Jas didn’t get caught. Not anymore. Not like last year, when she let him push her buttons until she snapped and got sent to the office with a pink slip and a pounding headache.
Now, she played smarter. She let the heat bubble just beneath the surface—never enough to boil over.
Except sometimes… it did.
Like when he leaned forward just a little too close and whispered things she couldn’t unhear. Like when his cologne stuck to her clothes longer than it should’ve, or when she caught herself wondering what it would be like if he meant any of it.
God, she hated that most of all.
The moment the bell rang, Jas was on her feet. She didn’t bother checking her phone—no one was texting her. No one ever did, unless it was her boss, her mom asking about dinner, or Madie and Bree sending memes in their group chat to check on her after another Logan encounter.
Today, she had no time for any of it. She needed to get to the bus stop or she’d miss the only route that got her to work before four.
The parking lot was already a zoo—people yelling across windshields, music blasting from someone’s trunk, and football players tossing a ball over cars like the laws of physics didn’t apply to them.
Jas walked fast, head down, hoodie pulled up. She hated the walk—hated the way her thighs chafed in the heat, hated the uneven slap of her soles on pavement, hated the ache in her shoulders from the weight of her bag. But most of all, she hated that she had to work tonight.
She was halfway across the lot when the voice came again.
“Yo, Monroe!”
She didn’t turn. Didn’t flinch.
“I’m not a damn dog,” she muttered.
But of course, Logan wasn’t done. She heard his footsteps jog up behind her, too light to belong to someone with that much swagger.
“Where you headed?”
“None of your business.”
“You always this cheerful after math class?”
“Only when I sit in front of human garbage.”
He laughed, like she’d told him a joke. “You need a ride?”
She finally stopped and turned. “Why would I get in a car with you?”
“Because I’m charming, and your boots are talking back to me.”
Jas glanced down at her scuffed boots, the sole peeling slightly at the front. Her cheeks flamed before she forced herself to snort. “Wow. A rich boy making fun of someone’s shoes. How original.”
He shrugged. “Didn’t say it to be mean. I just don’t like watching you limp your way across the county.”
“Then don’t watch me,” she snapped. “Problem solved.”
But even as she turned away, she felt it—that weight behind her, his gaze like heat on the back of her neck. It wasn’t cruel. Not in that moment.
It was… curious.
And that made her stomach flip in a way she absolutely hated.
The bus ride was slow and crowded. Jas stood most of the way, one hand on the rail, the other gripping her phone like it owed her money. She stared blankly at the lock screen. No texts. No calls. Nothing new.
The last time she’d gone out for fun was… God, how long had it been? Before summer? Before Logan made her into a punchline in the cafeteria with that god-awful joke about “plus-sized personality”?
She rolled her eyes at the memory and shoved the phone in her back pocket.
At least work was predictable.
That thought died the moment she walked through the diner’s double doors and saw him.
Logan Hayes.
In her booth.
With Jax and Drew.
She blinked like maybe she was hallucinating. But no. That was his messy dark hair, his Jefferson letterman jacket tossed over the back of the booth like it owned the place, and that infuriating grin he always wore when she was near.
Tammy, her manager, barely looked up from the hostess stand.
“You’re late.”
“It’s 3:57.”
Tammy raised one eyebrow. “And your shift starts at four. Go say hi to your boyfriends.”
Jas bit the inside of her cheek so hard it stung. She tied her apron tight and stomped over to the table.
“Didn’t know royalty made this their regular spot .”
Logan looked up from the menu like her voice was the soundtrack he’d been waiting for. “Didn’t know you’d be our waitress. Lucky us.”
“Unfortunately.”
“You always greet your guests with that much warmth?” Jax asked, grinning.
“Only the ones who look like they tip in Monopoly money.”
“Ouch,” Logan said. “You wound me.”
“I wish.”
She didn’t take their order so much as threaten them into giving it, then spun back to the kitchen, heart thudding harder than she wanted to admit. Why was he here? This wasn’t a hangout for the elite. It was a pit stop with cracked vinyl booths and sticky floors. Logan belonged in leather seats and rooftop parties. Not in her world.
Especially not today. Not after everything.
She watched him from the kitchen window as she waited for the food to be plated. He leaned into the booth like he belonged to it, tossing fries into his mouth like nothing in the world could touch him. And yet…
Every once in a while, his eyes flicked up.
To the kitchen.
To her.
Twenty minutes later, she brought their food out, balancing the tray like a pro—three greasy burgers, fries dripping in oil, and chocolate milkshakes so thick they could choke a spoon.
She didn’t speak as she lowered the plates. Logan, of course, did.
“Didn’t even ask what we wanted,” he said, lips quirking.
“You order the same thing every time,” she replied without looking at him. “Like your jokes—predictable and outdated.”
Jax cackled. Drew shook his head, smirking into his fries.
Logan just stared at her.
When she turned to walk away, his voice followed. “Your apron’s crooked.”
She stopped. “What?”
He gestured lazily. “The knot. It’s hanging off your hip.”
She reached back to adjust it without thinking.
Which was exactly when he reached forward and flicked the dangling tie—just a little tug, a stupid teasing thing.
But it threw her off balance.
The tray slipped in her hand. A full glass of soda teetered on the edge, tipped… and flew.
Straight onto the back of a woman seated at the next table.
She shrieked. The glass hit the floor and shattered. Jas froze.
“Oh my god—” she started, reaching for napkins, fumbling.
The woman—probably in her sixties, wearing a pale pink blouse that was now soaked in brown sugar fizz—shot to her feet.
Her husband stood too, all puffed-up protectiveness and immediate rage.
Tammy came out of the kitchen like a bullet. “What happened?”
Jas turned, panic flushing her throat. “It was him—Logan. He pulled—he—”
“I saw her,” Drew said quickly. “She tripped or something.”
“She dropped it,” Jax added. “Too many tables. She lost balance.”
Jas’s jaw dropped. “You’re kidding me—he touched—”
Logan said nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Tammy crossed her arms. “Jasmine. In the back. Now.”
Jas stood in the narrow back hallway behind the kitchen, hands clenched into fists so tight her nails left crescents in her palms.
Tammy came in a moment later, arms crossed like she’d been waiting years for an excuse.
“I didn’t do anything wrong,” Jas said before Tammy could speak.
Tammy arched a brow. “That woman’s blouse cost more than your rent. And you dumped soda all over it.”
“It was an accident. He—Logan—he pulled on my apron. Ask him. Ask anyone.”
“I don’t need to ask. I heard what his friends said.”
Jas took a step forward. “So you’re taking their word over mine?”
Tammy didn’t blink. “I’m taking the customers’ word. And the floor manager’s.”
“I’ve worked here for over a year.”
“And in that time,” Tammy said coldly, “you’ve had more complaints than anyone else on staff. You’re always late. You’ve got an attitude. You glare at people.”
“Because people treat me like shit.”
Tammy didn’t flinch. “I need someone who smiles. Who doesn’t throw drinks. Who doesn’t pick fights with customers, even if they’re jackasses.”
“So that’s it?” Jas asked, breath catching in her throat. “You’re firing me?”
Tammy’s eyes softened just a little—but not enough. “I’m sorry, Jas. But yeah. Turn in your apron.”
It took everything Jas had not to slam the damn thing down. She untied it, folded it slowly, and handed it over.
She walked out without another word.

Outside, the evening air bit colder than it should’ve in early fall. Jas didn’t care. She didn’t wait for the bus. She walked. Her hands shoved in her hoodie, head down, teeth grinding.
She didn’t cry.
Not yet.
She waited until she hit the corner of Maple and 12th, far from anyone she knew, where the streetlights flickered and the sidewalk cracked. Then she sank onto the curb, stared at the empty road, and let the tears fall.
No job. No paycheck. No way to help her mom. No chance of buying a new pair of shoes before winter.
And it was his fault.
Logan fucking Hayes.
Across the street, Logan sat behind the wheel of his car, engine idling low, music playing soft through the speakers. He’d meant to leave twenty minutes ago. Jax had already texted: 
u ghosting? but he hadn’t replied.
He wasn’t sure what he was still doing there.
Through the diner window, he’d watched Jas take off her apron. She didn’t slam it down like he half-expected. She just folded it. Calm. Controlled. That quiet kind of pissed-off that made your stomach twist because it meant you’d gone too far.
He hadn’t meant for her to get fired.
He hadn’t meant anything by it, really. Just teasing. Just the usual back-and-forth. It’s what they did. It had always been what they did.
But something about the way she’d walked out—back straight, jaw clenched, eyes blank—sat wrong in his chest.
He saw her again ten minutes later, sitting on the curb with her head down. Shoulders tight. Hands knotted in her hoodie.
She looked small.
Not weak. Never weak.
Just… not okay.
And that didn’t sit right with him either.
Not because he liked her. He didn’t. He couldn’t. That wasn’t how this worked.
But because for the first time in a long time, he didn’t feel like the guy on top. The one with all the swagger and the smirk and the punchlines.
He felt like the asshole.
And even though he didn’t move, didn’t speak, didn’t even roll down the window… he watched her until she stood up again, wiped her face, and walked off like nothing had happened.
And it hit him:
She wasn’t just surviving him.
She was surviving everything.
The apartment was dark when she got home.
No surprise. Her mom’s second shift ran late, and she wouldn’t be back until nearly two a.m. Jas flipped the hallway light on, toeing off her boots, and walked into the cramped kitchen.
There was a sticky note on the fridge.
Made pasta. Check the bottom shelf. Love you, baby. — Mom
She stared at the note for a second, letting the familiar ache crawl in. Guilt and gratitude. She couldn’t decide which felt heavier.
She opened the fridge, pulled out the container, and stared at it like it might solve her life. It didn’t. She put it back.
She didn’t have the energy to eat.
Her bedroom was small. Bare walls. A mattress on a wooden frame. A desk cluttered with textbooks, a half-finished English essay, and her cracked phone charger. She collapsed onto the bed without bothering to change, curling onto her side with her hoodie still zipped and her fingers clenched in the fabric.
No job meant no money.
No money meant no backup.
And Logan Hayes meant—
Nothing.
He was nothing.
Except he was still in her head. The way he looked at her when she glared. The way he smirked like he knew things he shouldn’t. The way he hadn’t spoken up. Hadn’t done anything.
That part twisted the deepest.
Because if he’d just said something, she might’ve been able to pretend. Pretend he wasn’t cruel. Pretend the flirting wasn’t a game. Pretend she wasn’t always the one left bleeding.
But silence?
That was worse than an insult.
Logan couldn’t sleep.
He’d made it home hours ago, but the night dragged like wet cement. Every time he shut his eyes, he saw her.
Jas on the curb. Jas with her shoulders hunched and fists in her hoodie. Jas walking away without looking back.
He knew how she walked when she was pissed—shoulders tight, jaw locked, middle finger practically twitching. But this had been different. She wasn’t just angry. She was… worn.
And he hated how that felt.
He’d replayed the moment a dozen times. The flick of her apron string. The sound of the glass tipping. The way she turned on him, eyes wide with disbelief.
He hadn’t even said anything.
That was what stuck.
Not the drink. Not the mess.
The silence.
He could’ve told the truth. It wouldn’t have cost him anything.
Instead, he stood there like a goddamn statue, letting her take the hit. Letting her fall harder because he was too much of a coward to open his mouth.
He shoved a hand through his hair and sat up on the edge of his bed, elbows on his knees, head hanging low.
She hated him. He knew that.
But he also knew he hadn’t always hated her.
Not really.
It was easier to push her. To laugh. To keep things loud and cruel and simple.
Jas didn’t go to school the next morning.
She told herself it was because her ankle hurt from walking home. Or because she needed to call around for new jobs before the weekend. Or because she just needed one damn day to breathe.
But the truth was uglier.
She didn’t want to see Logan.
Not today. Not with her chest still tight and her dignity scraped thin. Not with her mom asking if everything was okay while zipping her hoodie and grabbing keys at 6 a.m.
Jas had lied. Said she had a late start. Her mom hadn’t questioned it. She never did.
By noon, Jas was in bed with the curtains drawn, a bowl of cold cereal on her nightstand, and her laptop open to a half-finished resume template. She clicked through jobs on Craigslist—retail, fast food, cleaning. Nothing paid more than minimum wage. Nothing offered flexibility. Nothing would stop Logan Hayes from living in her head.
She hated that he was still there.
But worse, she hated that part of her wanted him to do something. Apologize. Explain. Show up.
She didn’t want to need anything from him.
Not validation. Not attention. Not the echo of that look he gave her when no one else was around.
The one that made her feel seen.
Not mocked. Not pitied.
Seen.
And yet—he said nothing.
And she didn’t chase ghosts.
Because Jas Monroe had never been simple. She was fire and sharp words and soft eyes she tried to hide behind sarcasm.
And that scared the hell out of him.

I turned 28 this month and figured it's finally time to open my heart to someone. I’ve spent most of my life in my own imaginative world—designing, dreaming, overthinking, you name it. Never been in a relationship, real or imaginary (yes, that rare breed), simply because I wasn’t ready. But now? I am.

**A little about me**:
I’m a designer with 6+ years of experience, and for the past 2 years, I’ve been working independently—chasing peace of mind and my passion. I’m a simple Telugu guy who finds joy in good food, great conversations, slow mornings, and soulful sunsets. Filter coffee is my fuel, and spontaneous travel is my therapy.

**Match details**
Religion: Hindu 
Caste : Kapu - I personally don't really bother about mine or partner caste
What i earn: Good enough to have a decent life in tire 1 city and beautiful life in tire 3 city 
Staying with parents : Yes, they prefer me to move out next day of my marriage 😂 and I am happy to start a new life 
Qualification: Bachelor's in design - Fucking good designer 

**My vibe**:
I love exploring places—especially underrated gems—and prefer staying with locals, soaking in new cultures. (Lived in Uttarakhand for two months just to experience that.) I talk to 3-year-olds and 80-year-youngs with the same curiosity. I cook, click pictures, and recently got serious about fitness too—so would love a partner with similar health goals.

**What I’m looking for**:
Someone who's emotionally available, open to sharing a life of adventure, stillness, chaos, and connection. If you’re someone who values meaningful moments, long conversations, local street food, weekend getaways, and dreamy sunrises—I think we’ll get along just fine.

I’m an extrovert with a sensitive core. Life with me might feel like a 4D movie—complete with drama, laughter, detours, and warm hugs. Just looking for a co-star now.

**Partner details/ looking for**
Religion: Hindu, 
Caste : I personally don't really bother about mine or partner caste, hope you are same too 
Earning: Good enough to support family 
Staying with parents : ones in a week and few days in years, Want somone who can respect them and will have same love for your parents 
Qualification:  Any graduation will work, if you are comfortable can join me and building a cafe, a farm, play school and a kindergarten or day care 

If this resonates, let’s talk. And if not, thanks for reading and wish me luck!

Love,
28M

We’ve been trying for months and it seems like we take one step forward and 5 steps backwards so this “trying” is been on and off. Our whole relationship we kinda set this non spoken rule where we wait to try things together which I still find cute but only for certain things, like coffee shops, restaurants, and maybe hiking places. But he’s more serious with that and what I mean by that is for example: when we started talking again I was going out on hikes with my friends and our dog but he took it as if “our thing”(hiking) wasn’t our thing anymore to what i explained that it means a totally different thing when I would go with him than when I go with my friends (that’s how I truly feel because I think the company makes the moment not the place). 
Now to my question: I said yes to a friend’s birthday trip when we weren’t talking and now that we are I haven’t been able to tell him because I’m afraid how he would react (I’m not scared of him I just think it’ll just make us fall apart again). 1. Is a girls trip, 2. my friend is paying for our tickets and 3. He can’t travel and I don’t know if he ever will be able to. Now I know he won’t like this because he, again, has this mindset where if we can’t go together to a new place we shouldn’t go. I really want to go but don’t want him to be mad about it or even stop talking to me. WIBTA if I do go to this trip or should I just pay my friend what he spent on the ticket and no go?

We got to Grand Helios around 7:15 and checked into the front desk for hotel keys. By 7:45 we had checked in, dropped off our bags, and got coffee at the little market. There was No line for security and walked straight into the park where there was a line for entry. At 8am they let people start entering the park. Some people at the front ran but the majority just walked or speed walked. We got to the entrance of MOM and they let everyone right into the queue. 

I thought the MOM was not part of EPA so I expected to wait in line for our hour for the ride to start operating. Turns out they had the ride up and running so we walked straight on to the ride! 0 wait, just the time it took to walk through the queue which has amazing. 

I don’t remember what time we got off of MOM but we had time to ride both Stardust Racers tracks and Hiccups Wing Gliders before the park opened to the public at 9! 

Staying on site was so worth it to us, I did not expect to be able to walk straight onto MOM which was a major bonus!!! And loved being able to go straight to the hotel for breaks.

They had a Trek in stock, so I rode it around to just get a general feel. I’d never been on an electric bike, and it’s been years since I’ve touched any kind of bike at all. I decided with the help of this group, to get one with a throttle. We came up with the Momentum Cito E+. I’d seen it reviewed and it actually seemed perfect for me. It was less expensive than the other brands I’ve researched, and I felt confident in my ability to be easy to please. It took about a week for it to come in, and I brought it home yesterday. With the baskets and other accessories I was in about $5,000. 

I took it about 2 miles away to pickup some groceries. Might as well just jump in! It’s slightly heavy, but I’m pretty strong. Even with the added weight of the groceries, I was pretty steady. I also stopped at the coffee shop, and carried those home in the front basket. Those made it an entire mile going at least 16-18 mph back home. The ride was so smooth, and the fat tires are such a nice stability feature for me. My first ride was a success, and I can’t wait to keep using it instead of my car in my new town!

My husband and I are planning to visit Norway this summer (late July/early August) and are hoping for some feedback on our itinerary. We’re both in our early 40s and enjoy nature, hiking, bird watching, great coffee and unique/odd things (like tiny weird museums or the world’s tallest [whatever].) My husband has always wanted to go to Norway because of the hydrogen highway - he is very interested in the science and tech side of the country’s green innovation.

Before planning the fun stuff, I’d love a gut check to see if the below itinerary makes general sense:

Day 1 (Tuesday)
For the start of the trip, we’d be flying in from Amsterdam to Bergen, walking around, and settling in.

Day 2 (Wednesday)
Spend the full day in Bergen! Exploring the town, going on some day hikes, checking out the science center

Day 3 (Thursday)
Take the train from Bergen to Flåm, and possibly take a fjord cruise. Enjoy the sights 

Day 4 (Friday)
Spend the full day in Flåm - hiking brekkefossen, possibly kayaking, sauna, relaxing etc

Day 5 (Saturday)
Take the train from Flåm to Geilo, and pick up a rental car. Spend the day in Geilo, trails/museums

Day 6 (Sunday)
Drive the hydrogen highway from Geilo to Rjukan, making stops along the way

Day 7 (Monday)
Drive to Oslo, check out the Norwegian Industrial Workers Museum, get a nice dinner

Day 8 (Tuesday)
Full day in Oslo, flying home the next day

My big questions are: does this itinerary make logistical sense? Anything big we would miss out on by going this route? I’ve seen some advice that leads me to believe we might not need the full day in Flåm and might wish to replace it with another day in Bergen or Oslo. I also heard that many places are closed on Sunday - would that make a road trip more challenging? Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)

I've lost in total 19lbs, 1st 5.6lb or 8.9kg depending on what you prefer... :)

I really dont know whether to up it to 7.5 or stay on the 5mg and do a metabolism boost to kick start myself? 

I feel I've stalled past few weeks although I have not one anything different.
I think I'm expecting bigger losses as I have overhauled my diet entirely.

I don't drink anything other than water or my 1st coffee in the morning. 

I use to drink tea and pepsi max all day.

I am trying to up my water consistently as I know I haven't been drinking enough.

I've ruled pasta out, crisps, no chocolate, take aways, basicially anything calorific that isn't nutritional i've ruled out in all fairness. 
Am I expecting too much from myself with these losses when I see such better ones from others? I know I shouldn't compared.

All I remember is a consultant saying to me once, after they had to remove my gastric balloon after making me really ill that my metabolism is shot to bits, that was in 2013. I was initially 14st when I had the balloon, privately. I went down to 11st as I was so poorly in hospital for a few weeks unable to keep ANYTHING inside, even the IVs I was bringing up I swear.

Since then I have just ballooned and battled, this is my time to get my life back.

I'm bigger than ever.

I have an app I stupidly joined and I am now contracted to for 12 months telling me i need 1900 calories, I've been trying to doing that for 3 weeks and hardly any losses.

It was the same time I started 5mg.

I have other apps saying I need 1200.

I am so confused and overwhelmed.
I feel I'm failing myself AGAIN.

Im 5ft1 I started at 20st 11lbs, 
I am now 19st 5.4lbs
My average steps are 5000.

I started this lifestyle change 5th April.

I ballooned more from literally comfort eating in a short space of time
I lost my mum, I gave up smoking 2 weeks later, cold turkey and turned to food for grief and replace the cigs.

I don't know if I have suppression... I still eat...
I know some people aren't eating and big losses but I still want food I just make better choices.

I think I have food noise, it is creeping in a bit more.

My family and I will soon embark on a crossing-the-big-pond adventure of (temporarily) locating to Ontario, Canada.

For your information, I have a solid background in physics so voltage, current, frequency and so on do not require explanation. I am really looking for advice on reliable converters that do not fry my equipment or burn out within the day. Amazon in Europe or Canada shows me mostly ""made in China"" converters, with significant amounts of bad reviews.

I am focusing on the single phase, 2kW toroidal core range to get a solid 1.6kW on constant load if needed - the more the better as this usually means less heat losses etc., but I have read outlets in Ontario are usually limited to 15A anyway. Silence is nice. Not ""made in China"" would be a plus. A reliable circuit breaker is essential as I do not want to fry my expensive electronic piano or coffee machine.

German Trek and Eat Type 2 with a best by date of Jun 2027.

What a great ration with the exception being that it was, again, hit by customs and they took both main meals. Sad as they were going to be interesting as one was Balkan Risotto and the other was Creamy Pasta with Chicken and Spinach! 

This ration, unlike many similar to it, came with compressed survival bars too!

Pic 1 shows that fantastic little spice shaker. 4 dif spices included!

Pic 2 shows the contents I actually got; still a fair amount. Plenty of coffee/tea and cold beverages as those tea packets makes 2 L, so that's 4 L of tea alone. That's 4 espresso packets folks!

Pics 3-4 show the muesli dry and then reconned. It was great! Lots of fruit, mildly sweet, and great flavor. 

Pic 5 shows that lemon tea. Very nice!

Pic 6 is the coffee, made with skim milk and 1 sugar. Fantastic!

Pic 7 shows the biscuits! What a treat these were! Super fresh with a mild sweet taste. Far better than most biscuits in rations. 

Pic 8 shows the survival bars! These were a first for me and a great experience. Very crumbly,  slightly sweet, tasted faintly of shortbread and vanilla.  Not offensive at all but not something I'd want to eat for an extended period of time.

Pics 9-12 show packaging and ingredients as well as a letter the company included.

Pics 13-14 show info on the survival bars.

This ration was a great experience and I'd recommend it for sure just based on what I got. Those small strawberry cream candies were great too!  It could have used a jam or honey for those biscuits, but had the 2 mains arrived intact, there would have been ample opportunity for those biscuits to shine!

1kvwvpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kvwvpv/best_shots_in_12_seconds_gaggia_evo_pro/,Best shots in ~ 12 seconds [Gaggia Evo pro],"Hi all, I got my first machine, a gaggia evo pro, about 3 months ago. I've been a long time espresso drinker but never owned a machine. I decided to try dialing in by aiming for 25-30 seconds and then tweak from there because I was having a hard time distinguishing what was bitter and what was sour, and I definitely knew how long 25 seconds was.

After my first bag I gave up on this as the coffee was incredibly sour, to the point of being undrinkable alone and pretty bad with milk. Since then I have come to understand the difference, and have been dialing in strictly based on taste. I have found an extraction time of about 12 seconds produces the best espresso (I am not aiming for time, I don't even measure time anymore I just did to make this post) and was curious if anybody had similar experience.

For reference I am using a fellow opus at \~ 2.1 - 2.3 depending on the bean and a 20g IMS basket. with 20g beans and a 40g output.  I am using a variety of beans from nice coffee as wellas canyon coffee in los Angeles.

I have this tagged as dialing in help bc the little popup asked me to, and of course I am more than open to help, but I have the espresso mostly dialed in to a point I am very happy with. I am always tweaking but I cant see myself changing dramatically enough to get a 25 second extraction time unless I am missing something major",1,1748272495.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I Used to Think ""Grit"" Was the Answer – Here's What Actually Unlocked My Next Level 🚀","**Stuck in Hyperdrive? I Used to Think ""Grit"" Was the Answer – Here's What Actually Unlocked My Next Level 🚀**

Hey, friends! 🌟 Have you ever felt like you’re sprinting on a treadmill that’s stuck on max speed, and no matter how hard you try, you just can’t seem to get anywhere? Yeah, that was me. For a long time, I was convinced that the secret to success was all about grit. Just **put your head down**, **work harder**, and **keep grinding**. 

But you know what? That’s only half of the equation. Let’s dive into what I discovered that really freed me from that hyperdrive life.

### 🚦 The Grit Myth

I thought embracing grit meant pushing through every obstacle like a superhero. But spoiler alert: it doesn’t always work out like that! Here’s what I learned instead:

1. **Burnout is Real**: I pushed myself to the brink, convinced that sleeping less and skipping breaks was the answer. But instead of becoming the best version of myself, I was just... exhausted. Anyone else relate? 😅

2. **Reflection Over Just Action**: Grit doesn’t mean you should run in circles. Sometimes, hitting pause to reflect on your progress—or lack thereof—is way more productive than another all-nighter.

3. **Adaptability is Key**: Real talk: the ability to pivot and adjust your approach is what gives you wings. I had to learn that sometimes the *detours* were actually the most valuable parts of my journey.

### 🧭 Unlocking the Next Level

So, what did I do when I finally decided to ease up on the gas? Here’s my game plan that took me from feeling stuck to unlocking my next level:

- **Set Intentional Goals**: What’s your mission? Write it down. Seriously, having a clear vision can make all the difference. 

- **Prioritize Self-Care**: It’s not just a catchphrase; it’s a game-changer! I started treating my downtime like it was part of my hustle, not an afterthought. Rest is where the magic happens, my friends!

- **Seek Feedback**: I used to think asking for help made me weak. Turns out, getting input can provide insights I never even thought of! Plus, building my support network has been a total lifesaver.

- **Celebrate Progress**: Notice the little wins! Did you complete that challenging task? Have a coffee, take a moment to breathe. Making this a habit keeps your spirits up when things get tough.

### 🔑 Finding Your Flow

So here’s my two cents—grit is important, but let’s not forget there’s more to the equation. It’s about balance, adaptability, and taking care of *you* along the way. 

Next time you find yourself feeling that familiar grind, maybe try hitting the brakes and focusing on working smarter, not just harder. Who knows? That could just be your unlock!

1kvwtx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1kvwtx7/whats_one_tiny_habit_thats_massively_upgraded/,🔄 What's ONE tiny habit that's massively upgraded your focus lately? Spill the tea!,"Hey, beautiful people of MaximizeMe! 🌟 So, I was sitting here with my morning coffee, reflecting on some super simple habits that have genuinely *changed the game* for my focus lately. You know how sometimes it feels like your brain is trying to juggle too many things at once? Yep, I've been there! So, I wanted to share one tiny habit that's really upped my focus and might just help you too!

**Drum roll, please... 🥁**

**It's the good ol' 5-Minute Rule!** 

Here's how it works:

- **Set a timer for 5 minutes.** Sounds easy enough, right? Just 5 minutes! 
- **Choose a task.** Whether it’s that essay you've been avoiding or responding to emails that keep piling up. 
- **Focus like crazy.** For those 5 minutes, put your phone on Do Not Disturb (yes, that means no scrolling TikTok!). Just dive in and work on that task. 

**Why does this work so well?** 

Think about it: 
- **No pressure.** It’s only 5 minutes! You can handle that. Even on your worst day, right?
- **Momentum boost.** Once the timer goes off, you might find yourself in the zone and want to keep going. But if not? You've still accomplished something. High-five! 🙌
- **Break the overwhelm.** Breaking tasks down into bite-size chunks makes them less daunting. Like eating a pizza one slice at a time instead of trying to chow down the whole thing at once. 🍕 

I started doing this with my household chores too. Seriously, I used to dread laundry, but committing to just 5 minutes of folding made it feel less like climbing Everest. And not only that, but I actually could fold a whole basket in about 15 minutes because, guess what? Sometimes the hardest part is just *getting started*. 

Ever tried something simple that turned out to be a game changer? I’d love to hear your stories! What’s a tiny habit that boosted your focus? Let’s spill the tea! 🍵✨",1,1748272366.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

He wakes up. He’s in a 50s style poodle skirt dress. He’s in some sort of trance, (kind of like get out but for trans people ig) and he doesn’t seem to mind the dress.

At night, he thinks it’s safe, and he sneaks away towards the one landline in the father’s office. He calls his mom, frantic as he explains what’s happening.

# Why flexible part-time work matters today

[Flexible work arrangements](https://bask.health/blog/work-from-home-jobs-overnight) have changed how we work today. The old office setup with strict hours is making way for options that put work-life balance and personal freedom first.

# The move from 9-to-5 to on-your-time

The classic 9-to-5 schedule doesn't match today's needs anymore. The numbers tell an interesting story - 58% of Americans can work from home at least once a week, while 35% have the choice to work remotely all week long. People love these flexible options. When companies offer them, 87% of workers take them up and typically work from home three days a week.

This change goes beyond just where people work—it's about letting them choose when to work. One study shows that 80% of workers would turn down jobs without flexible schedules. Part-time work from home jobs really appeal to people who want this kind of freedom.

# Who benefits most from flexible work?

Moms with young kids see the biggest advantage in flexible work. The numbers back this up—[38% of mothers with young children](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/americans-are-embracing-flexible-work-and-they-want-more-of-it) say they would have cut back hours or quit without workplace flexibility. All the same, many other groups benefit too:

* Students balancing work and classes
* People taking care of family members
* Those who need time for medical appointments
* Workers looking to save on commute costs
* Professionals who want to live in cheaper areas

So, companies that offer flexibility see better staff retention, more engaged employees, and better hiring results.

# Common challenges with traditional remote jobs

Remote work comes with its own set of hurdles. Many remote workers miss the daily face-to-face connections with colleagues. On top of that, it becomes harder to separate work from personal life, which can lead to burnout.

Tech problems create another challenge - remote workers need to fix their own computer issues without onsite help. Working from coffee shops or libraries brings up security risks, too.

Career growth can take a hit with remote work. Studies show that [remote employees often get passed over](https://www.workplaceless.com/blog/benefits-and-challenges-of-remote-working) for promotions compared to office workers. This happens because remote workers aren't as visible to management. Companies need good strategies to tackle these challenges and get the most out of part-time remote work while avoiding the downsides.

# Top part-time work-from-home jobs that fit your schedule

The right part-time work-from-home job depends on your skills and schedule. The digital world now gives you plenty of options that work around your availability.

# Virtual assistant roles

Virtual assistants help entrepreneurs and small businesses with remote administrative support. These jobs give you great flexibility and [pay around $17 per hour](https://www.timeetc.com/be-a-virtual-assistant/). You can pick your hours and workload, which works great if your schedule changes often. Companies like Time etc, promote how their VA roles can ""fit seamlessly into family life."" This lets professionals balance their commitments while using their admin skills from home.

# Freelance writing and editing

Content creation gives you one of the most flexible remote careers. Writers and editors pick projects that match their schedule and interests on platforms like Upwork. The platform's [freelancers earned over $3.80 billion in 2022](https://www.upwork.com/resources/best-gig-apps). Project-based payment instead of hourly rates lets you control your work schedule completely.

# Online tutoring and teaching

Online teaching has become quite profitable, especially with specialized knowledge. Business teachers earn up to $55 per hour. General English instruction pays between $14-$22 hourly. Platforms like VIPKid mention ""no minimum hour requirement."" This helps educators create schedules that work best for them.

# Customer support with flexible shifts

Remote customer service jobs come with various shift options. Jobs range from evening part-time work to weekend-only schedules. Companies attract quality representatives by offering flexible scheduling at their virtual call centers.

# Transcription and captioning work

Rev and similar transcription services pay weekly and let you choose your audio files. Workers like that ""you can work when, where, and how much you want"". This setup works perfectly when your schedule keeps changing.

# Short task and gig platforms

Gig platforms connect you to short-term projects you can finish in small time blocks. TaskRabbit offers ""contactless tasks"" for remote work seekers. Platforms like Skillshare let content creators earn [passive income through course creation](https://bask.health/blog/online-business-opportunities-from-home).

# How Bask Health supports flexible work in telehealth

Telehealth has become a rich source of flexible employment opportunities. Companies like Bask Health are leading the way by creating adaptable work environments. Patient demand and innovative business models drive the growing need for professionals who can work on their own schedules.

# Our approach to work-life balance

Bask Health recognizes that healthcare professionals value flexibility above all. Our team members work remotely in different time zones. They receive [annual stipends of approximately $1,000](https://bask.health/blog/work-from-home-jobs-california) to set up home offices, join wellness programs, and pursue continuous learning. The company provides unlimited PTO and complete health benefits that cover families, too.

We've moved away from the strict scheduling that traditional healthcare settings use. Healthcare professionals can choose weekday work hours starting between 7:00 am - 9:30 am. Both part-time and full-time positions help them balance their work and personal lives better.

# Opportunities in telehealth business models

The telehealth sector features several business models that naturally support flexible work:

* Direct-to-consumer services scale quickly with minimal physical setup
* Subscription-based models generate steady revenue through monthly fees for unlimited consultations
* Business-to-business partnerships connect with hospitals, insurance companies, and employers
* Platform-as-a-service options let healthcare providers use telehealth without heavy technology investment

These models create ideal conditions for part-time remote work since they [cover different time zones and non-traditional hours](https://biovoicenews.com/telemedicine-business-models-opportunities-for-providers-investors/).

# Why telemedicine startups need flexible teams

Patient demand varies throughout the day and week, making flexible teams vital for telehealth startups. Virtual care goes beyond regular office hours. Many providers now schedule appointments during evenings and weekends to meet patient needs.

Clinicians can create work patterns that match their lifestyle preferences. Many nurse practitioners choose weekend shifts to handle childcare during weekdays. This freedom helps curb burnout—a serious healthcare concern—by giving professionals more control over their schedules.

# Bask Health's role in telehealth business management solutions

Our platform supports various [telehealth business models](https://bask.health/blog/telemedicine-business-models) and makes operations easier. Healthcare providers can build any digital health experience without coding through our white-label solution. Entrepreneurs launch telehealth businesses faster and focus on patient care instead of technical details.

The system blends appointment management, patient registration, and billing processes. These elements are the foundations of a successful telehealth practice. Our affordable solutions extend healthcare to 30 million Americans living in healthcare deserts.



# Tips to find and succeed in flexible remote jobs

Landing and thriving in remote positions takes careful preparation. The remote job market keeps growing, creating more opportunities—and sadly, more scams too. Let me show you how to find real flexible work and excel in your remote career.

# How to spot legit opportunities

You need to stay alert when looking for genuine remote jobs. Take time to research potential employers—real companies usually have [established websites with clear contact details](https://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/companies-with-legitimate-work-from-home-jobs) and employee reviews on trusted sites. Watch out for job posts promising quick money with little work or asking you to pay for training or background checks.

The payment terms need careful review before you say yes to any position. Real employers give you written agreements that spell out how you'll get paid. Your chances of running into scams drop substantially when you use trusted job boards like FlexJobs, [Remote.co](http://Remote.co), or Jobspresso. These platforms check each listing to make sure it's real.

# Setting your schedule and sticking to it

Structure becomes your best friend once you land a flexible position. Start by setting fixed work hours that feel like a regular office day. Your brain will learn to switch into work mode during these times. Make sure everyone at home knows your schedule to avoid interruptions.

A [dedicated workspace](https://bask.health/blog/low-cost-home-based) helps signal to your brain and family that you're ""at work."" The core team needs to know when they can reach you, so be clear about your online hours.

# Tools to manage time and productivity

Remote work success depends on having the right time management tools. Look for these features:

* User-friendly design that's easy to navigate
* Task management tools that track deadlines
* Smooth connection with your calendars and communication apps

Time tracking apps show exactly where your hours go and help boost your productivity. Project management platforms like Asana or Todoist help you break big projects into smaller, doable tasks.

# Building a portfolio for freelance work

Freelancers need a [strong portfolio](https://bask.health/blog/unique-business-ideas-for-ladies) as their main marketing tool. Show off your best work and organize samples based on what your target clients want to see. Each project should tell a story about the challenges you solved and the tools you used.

Fresh, relevant work needs to go into your portfolio regularly to show what you can do right now. New freelancers can use personal projects and class work to showcase their skills until they build up client work.

# Finding Your Ideal Flexible Remote Career

Remote part-time work has altered the map of employment by offering new freedom to balance professional goals with personal life. This piece shows how flexible work setups help people in a variety of groups. Parents can manage childcare duties better. Professionals can pursue more education. People with health conditions can work at their own pace.

You can find remote work that fits your schedule because so many options exist. Virtual assistant roles, freelance writing, online tutoring, customer support positions, transcription work, and gig platforms give you different paths to control your time. Your perfect match probably exists among these choices.

Bask Health knows the power of flexibility from direct experience. Our telehealth model shows how businesses can succeed while putting our team members' work-life balance first. Healthcare professionals who work with us control their schedules without giving up career growth or pay. This proves that flexibility and professional advancement can work together smoothly.

Remote work success depends on two key things: finding real opportunities and building good self-management skills. You'll need solid research, trusted job websites, regular schedules, proper work areas, and the right productivity tools to help you succeed in this experience.

This move toward flexible work means more than just a passing trend. It shows a basic change in how we value our time and wellness. Today's job seekers put flexibility right up there with pay and benefits. Companies that understand this gain big advantages when hiring and keeping talented people.

Your path to schedule-friendly work begins when you know your skills, understand when you're available, and learn about the options we've shared. Take your first step today. Look into one chance that lines up with your talents and schedule needs. Your ideal flexible career might be closer than you imagine.

Grab a coffee and start your day off with some optimism. Each morning, I will share a few recent optimistic news articles in various sections so you can start your day off in a hopeful mood rather than being all doomy and gloomy.

* ""Wholly Optimistic” are stories that for the most part that should leave you feeling good after reading them without much of a caveat.
* “Cautiously Optimistic” are stories that can have caveats or may be things that could turn out bad, but for right now, are good.
* “I Dissent” are stories of protests or certain figures speaking out against bad policies or injustices.
* “Take the Edge Off” are stories that are feel good and may deal with topics that are less partisan or heated.

Here are this morning’s optimistic stories:

In the distance, a small café invites you in with the aroma of fresh pumpkin bread and vanilla coffee. You settle by a window, wrapped in a chunky knit sweater the color of soft moss, sipping slowly and watching the world slow down around you.

Your favorite autumn playlist plays softly, acoustic guitar strings, mellow vocals and a hint of piano, each note echoing the perfect balance of introspection and quiet joy.

1kvwlpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1kvwlpa/first_post_query_how_to_move_through_this_guilt/,First post query. How to move through this guilt? Am I trying too hard?,"A little about me. I lost my wife two years ago. We were childhood sweethearts. Although we didn’t marry until we were in our 30s I knew she was the only woman for me. Truly. I went away to university, travelled the world and although there were other women she was always the one. I came back and we were together again. I always knew. We always knew. 
Her passing was sudden and unexpected and devastating and our daughter and myself were left with a massive hole in our lives. 
After her passing I did date other women soon after, to fulfil a need. I have had dalliances with two women who were not looking for relationships but were happy to have a casual arrangement with myself to fulfil these needs. 
More recently however I began to think I might want a bit more than that, I was on a couple of dating sites but it just didn’t feel right…. and then I met this woman. At first it was just a coffee and pleasant chat like many of the others I’d been on, then we met a second time and I started noticing certain things about her, and for the first time I started to feel like I wanted a real connection with someone. 
Now for the purpose of this post. After we met a couple more times i started to think this woman had the pieces I needed to feel a real connection, we were intimate and wow- the guilt hit me so hard, I’ve not felt that guilt previously with any of the previous experiences I had with the other women but this time it was awful. I ran. She was kind. We talked. And I told her I was scared and she was so understanding. We saw each other a few more times then my daughter was away with family and I invited this woman to my home to stay for a few days. In hindsight bad idea, but I just wanted to try and live a normal life. We did normal stuff and went out into town and I just felt weird stuff like my wife was going to walk round the corner and see me out with this other woman. Crazy. 
The second night she stayed I had such terrible nightmares and woke up crying. 
Again she was wonderful and so understanding but I was just emotionally wrung out. She left so I could have some time and now I’m here wondering wtf to do. 
I have this beautiful, sexy, kind, emotionally aware woman who has been one of the most understanding people about my loss who I want to feel a connection to, I do feel a connection to. But I don’t want to hurt her, I’m scared I’m trying too hard to move on, I’m not sure if I’ve got the emotional capacity and I feel so much guilt. 
Can anyone give me any insight who has been through similar.

1kvwkqd,https://i.redd.it/fzrepwzg553f1.png,Progress after 1 week (from 152/119 down to 118/81),"Finally saw a Doctor after experiencing symptoms of stable angina (chest pain during exertion/exercise) that I've been feeling since the start of April, but finally saw a doctor about it on May 19th. IAMA male in my late 30s.

He took my blood pressure and it read as 152/119. He also took an EKG and found nothing wrong. The blood pressure was alarming. 

We went through my medical history and my family's medical history. I told him I've never had high blood pressure before, but I've had untreated high cholesterol. I also advised that my Dad has HTN and high cholesterol, and went through 2 TIA strokes. He scheduled blood work for the following day, prescribed me Aspirin Protect to take once a day, and to take my blood pressure in the morning and at night.

I went to the lab the following day to draw blood and my doctor received the results the same day. He said everything looks good, but that we need to work on a plan to lower my cholesterol and blood pressure. He also scheduled a visit to the cardiologist for a cardiac stress test (Bruce method, walking on the treadmill).

2 days later I'm at the cardiologist to run the stress test. It was difficult and was feeling the pain in my chest and a bit in my jaw, especially towards the end when it was the most difficult. He would ask me how I'm feeling every minute-ish. Pain scale was about 8/10 at the highest feeling but it was probably more like a 6.5 or 7. Once I was done he sat me down so I can rest while he continued to monitor the test. At one point a few minutes later my vision started to get hazy/fuzzy and my hearing starting to muffle a bit, so they had me lay down for a few minutes and I felt better. The pain in my chest was slowly going away minute to minute.

We went into his office and advised I fly back home and go through cardiac catheterization immediately. I told him we don't have enough money, don't have a job, and I don't have insurance at the moment. We live in the States and are currently living in Mexico, but will be back soon. Once I get approved for Medi-Cal, then that will be my top priority.

I asked him if I need to take any meds and when I asked him, he kinda huffed and puffed like he was showing some attitude before he went to his PC to put the prescription list together. He prescribed me a statin, a beta blocker, CoDegregan (Clopidogrel/Ácido Acetilsalicílico) to prevent clots, and one that treats GERD. He's scheduled to see me again this Wednesday.

In the meantime, I've been taking my meds, been eating healthy (watching my salt and consumption of red meats & pork, and increasing my fruit & veggies intake), going for walks, stopped drinking soda and coffee, and getting adequate rest. I've also been taking my blood pressure throughout the day. Ever since my first doctor's visit and after I started taking meds, there's been a noticable drop in my blood pressure! I hope this continues and I get back to good health! ",3,1748271740.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

Ah, travel! The very word conjures images of sun-drenched beaches, bustling metropolises, or serene mountain vistas. But before we can sip sangria in Spain or hike the Inca Trail, there's that little hurdle: booking the flights. And let's be honest, wading through the ocean of airline websites, aggregators, and ever-shifting prices can feel like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded. It's a lot! That's where the quest for the **best ticket fare reviews** comes in. We're all looking for that golden ticket, that sweet spot where price meets convenience and a touch of comfort. It's a real art form, isn't it? Trying to crack the code of airline pricing, figuring out when's the *absolute best* time to hit ""book,"" and which platform is truly your best friend in this whole endeavor. Stick with me, and we'll untangle this Gordian knot of air travel economics together. Because, let's face it, nobody wants to feel like they've been taken for a ride before the ride even begins!

Best Ticket Fare Reviews: Your Compass in the Sky-High Price Jungle
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, let's get down to brass tacks. When we talk about finding the **best ticket fare reviews**, what are we really after? It's not just about the raw dollar amount, is it? While price is undoubtedly a huge factor – and, let’s be real, sometimes *the* factor – there’s a whole lot more under the hood. Think of it like buying a car. You wouldn’t just compare the sticker price, would you? You'd look at fuel efficiency, safety features, reliability ratings, and maybe even how comfy the seats are. Finding the best flight is similar. We're weighing up a multitude of factors, all vying for our attention and, more importantly, our hard-earned cash. Reviews help us cut through the noise, giving us insights from fellow travelers who have already braved the booking beast. They’ve been there, done that, and are kind enough to share their experiences. It’s like having a seasoned travel pro whispering secrets in your ear.

### Beyond the Bottom Line: What Reviews *Really* Tell You

So, what kind of wisdom can we glean from these invaluable reviews? It's a treasure trove of information, if you know where to look. While the headline price difference might grab your attention, delving into reviews reveals the true value proposition. Are people raving about an airline's punctuality, or are the reviews riddled with horror stories of missed connections and lost luggage? Is that super-cheap fare the result of last-minute cancellations or hidden fees that magically appear at checkout? Reviews paint a much richer picture than a simple number ever could. They touch upon everything from the ease of the booking process on a particular website to the actual experience on the plane – the legroom (or lack thereof!), the quality of the in-flight service, even the taste of the lukewarm coffee. These are the little details that can make or break a travel experience, and honest reviews are the best way to get a feel for them before you commit.

Consider this: a site might boast the *lowest* listed price, but are users complaining about a clunky interface that takes ages to load and crashes frequently? Is their customer service practically non-existent when things go south? These are the sorts of things reviews will tell you. It's not just about finding a cheap seat; it's about finding a booking experience that's relatively painless and an airline that won't leave you stranded in the middle of nowhere with no recourse. Think of reviews as your early warning system, highlighting potential pitfalls and celebrating hidden gems.

### The Power of the Peer-to-Peer Perspective

In this age of social media and online communities, the power of peer-to-peer feedback is astounding. We trust the opinions of our fellow consumers more than any marketing material a company could put out. It just feels more… authentic, doesn’t it? When someone takes the time to share their personal experience, good or bad, it carries a certain weight. They’re not trying to sell you something; they’re just telling it like it is, based on their own journey. And that kind of honesty is gold.

Think about it. You're planning a trip to, say, Bali. You see a flight on a site you've never heard of, offering an unbelievable price. Your first thought might be, ""Wow, this is amazing!"" But then you pause. Is it *too* amazing to be true? A quick search for reviews on that site and the airline funding the flight could prevent a costly headache down the line. Are other travelers singing their praises, or are they reporting bait-and-switch tactics and unresponsive support? That peer perspective grounds you in reality and helps you make a more informed decision. It demystifies the process and gives you a sense of security knowing you’re not just jumping in blind.

Cracking the Code of Flight Prices: Tools and Techniques Reviewed

Alright, so we know *why* reviews are important. Now, let's talk about the *how*. How do we actually go about finding those elusive **best ticket fare reviews**? It's not as simple as just typing ""best flight reviews"" into Google and hoping for the best. You need to know where to look, what to look for, and how to interpret what you find. It’s a bit of a treasure hunt, but the rewards – a cheaper flight and a smoother travel experience – are well worth the effort. We’re going to dive into the different tools at our disposal, the techniques savvy travelers use, and how to make sure the reviews you’re reading are legitimate and helpful. Because, sadly, not all reviews are created equal!

### Aggregators vs. Airline Websites: A Review Showdown

This is often the first fork in the road for any flight search. Do you start with a flight aggregator like Google Flights, Skyscanner, or Kayak, or do you go directly to the websites of individual airlines? Both have their pros and cons, and reviews often highlight these differences. Aggregators are fantastic for getting a broad overview of prices across multiple airlines and dates. It’s like having a panoramic view of the flight landscape. They can quickly show you which days are cheaper to fly on, often with handy calendar views that highlight price fluctuations. Reviews of aggregators often focus on the accuracy of their pricing, the ease of their interface, and any additional features they offer, like price alerts or filters. Are users finding outdated information on a particular aggregator? Are their search results easy to understand and sort?

On the other hand, booking directly with the airline can sometimes offer benefits that aggregators don’t. Airlines might have loyalty programs that give you special perks or discounts, and dealing directly with them can sometimes make resolving issues easier. Reviews of airline websites will, of course, focus on the booking experience on their specific platform, the ease of managing your booking, and the overall level of customer service. Are people complaining about confusing website layouts or difficulty making changes to their reservation? Are users reporting positive interactions with the airline's support team? Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches, often revealed through reviews, helps you decide where to start your flight search.

### The Nitty-Gritty: Decoding Review Content

Once you find reviews, you need to know how to read between the lines. A glowing five-star review might be genuine, or it could be written by someone with unrealistic expectations or even (gasp!) a fake review. Similarly, a scathing one-star review might be from someone who had a genuinely terrible experience, or it could be from a disgruntled person with a disproportionate sense of grievance. It's all about context and looking for patterns.

What kind of things should you be looking for in reviews?

- **Specific Details:** General reviews (""It was good/bad"") are less helpful than those that provide concrete examples. Did their flight get delayed, and if so, for how long? Was the customer service agent helpful, and what was the nature of their issue? Specificity lends credibility.
- **Consistent Themes:** Are multiple reviewers complaining about the same issue, like hidden fees or poor communication? This is a strong indicator of a recurring problem.
- **Reviewer Demographics (where possible):** Sometimes, knowing who wrote the review can offer insights. Is it a seasoned traveler who flies frequently, or a first-timer whose expectations might be different? Review platforms sometimes offer this information.
- **Responses from the Company:** Does the company respond to reviews, and if so, how do they handle negative feedback? A company that engages with reviewers, even to apologize, shows they value customer feedback.

By analyzing these elements, you can start to form a more nuanced picture of what to expect. Don’t just take one review as gospel; look for trends and patterns across multiple reviews. It’s like being a detective, piecing together clues to get the full story.

### Beyond the Big Names: Exploring Niche Review Sites

While the major travel websites and aggregators are great starting points, don't overlook niche review sites or forums dedicated to specific types of travel or airlines. These can often offer incredibly detailed and specific insights that you won't find elsewhere. For instance, if you're looking for reviews on flying with a specific airline on a particular route, a forum for frequent flyers of that airline might have a wealth of real-world experiences.Similarly, if you're interested in budget airlines, there might be forums or blogs specifically dedicated to reviewing those carriers. These niche communities can offer a level of granular detail that the larger sites simply can't match. They’re where you’ll find the real insider tips and tricks, the things only frequent travelers know. Digging into these communities can uncover some seriously valuable intel.

Flight Delays and Cancellations: What Reviews Reveal About Airline Reliability

One of the biggest anxieties of air travel is the specter of delays and cancellations. Nobody wants to be stuck at an airport for hours, missing connections, or having their carefully planned trip thrown into chaos. This is where **best ticket fare reviews** truly shine, offering a window into an airline's reliability (or lack thereof). A cheap fare is no bargain if it comes with a high probability of your flight being cancelled or delayed indefinitely. Reviews provide anecdotal evidence, gathered from the experiences of other travelers, that can help you assess this crucial factor. It’s like getting a heads-up from someone who’s already navigated the choppy waters of a particular airline.

### The Ripple Effect of Disruption: Traveler Accounts

Think about it. When a flight is significantly delayed or cancelled, the impact on travelers can be huge. It’s not just about the inconvenience at the airport; it can mean missed events, lost vacation days, and added expenses for unexpected accommodation or alternative travel arrangements. Reviews often capture the emotional and practical toll these disruptions take. You’ll read accounts of frantic passengers trying to rebook, frustrated by a lack of communication from the airline, or left to fend for themselves in unfamiliar cities. These stories, while sometimes harrowing, are incredibly informative. They tell you not just *if* delays happen, but also *how* the airline handles them, which can be just as important. Are they proactive in offering solutions, or do they leave passengers in the lurch?

Looking for patterns in reviews related to delays and cancellations can be a powerful predictor of future experiences. Are there numerous complaints about a specific route being chronically delayed? Are reviewers consistently mentioning poor communication from the airline during irregular operations? If you see a recurring theme of significant delays or cancellations on a route you're considering, especially coupled with negative comments about the airline's handling of these issues, it might be worth paying a little extra for a more reliable option, even if the initial fare is higher. Peace of mind, after all, is priceless.

Customer Service: Reviews as the Litmus Test of Airline Support

Beyond the brass tacks of flight times and prices, the quality of customer service an airline provides can make a world of difference, especially when things go wrong. And let's be honest, in the complex world of air travel, things *do* occasionally go wrong. Your luggage might get lost, your flight might be delayed, or you might have a last-minute change of plans. How an airline handles these situations is a true test of their customer-centricity. And guess what? Reviews are your best resource for assessing this aspect. Finding **best ticket fare reviews** that specifically mention customer service is like getting a preview of how you might be treated if you ever need help.

### Navigating the Support Maze: Positive and Negative Encounters

Customer service reviews often fall into two distinct categories: glowing praise for exceptional assistance or frustrated rants about unhelpful or unresponsive staff. Both are valuable. Positive reviews highlight representatives who went the extra mile, who were empathetic and efficient in resolving a problem. These reviews give you confidence that, if you need help, you might just find someone who can truly assist you. They paint a picture of an airline that values its passengers and is willing to invest in training its staff to handle difficult situations.

On the flip side, negative reviews regarding customer service can be a major red flag. Are multiple reviewers complaining about long hold times, unhelpful agents, or a general lack of empathy? Are there accounts of agents being dismissive or unwilling to offer solutions? These reviews can tell you a lot about an airline's approach to problem-solving and their overall regard for passenger well-being. While one negative review might be an outlier, a pattern of complaints suggests a systemic issue. Furthermore, reviews often detail the specific channels of support customers used – phone, chat, social media – and the relative success or failure of each. This can help you decide the best way to reach out if you ever need assistance.

### The Value of Human Interaction in an Automated World

In an increasingly automated world, the importance of positive human interaction, especially when you're feeling stressed or frustrated, cannot be overstated. Getting a helpful and understanding voice on the other end of the line when your travel plans are in jeopardy can make a world of difference. Reviews that highlight positive interactions with customer service representatives are basically testimonials to the value of that human element. They remind us that behind the algorithms and the boarding passes, there are people, and sometimes, those people can genuinely help you out of a jam. So, when you’re sifting through those **best ticket fare reviews**, pay close attention to what people are saying about their interactions with the airline’s support team. It could be the deciding factor between a smooth resolution and a protracted headache.

Hidden Fees and Tricky Terms: Unmasking the Fine Print Through Reviews

Ah, the dreaded hidden fee! You think you've found a fantastic deal, you get to the checkout page, and suddenly, the price jumps significantly due to baggage fees, seat selection fees, or other charges you didn't anticipate. It's one of the most frustrating aspects of booking flights, and it feels, frankly, a bit sneaky. This is another area where **best ticket fare reviews** are absolutely indispensable. Fellow travelers who have already navigated the booking process with a particular airline or website are often quick to point out these potential financial landmines, saving you from a potentially unpleasant surprise. They're essentially giving you a heads-up about the fine print that you might otherwise miss.

### Decoding the Cost Breakdown: What Reviews Reveal About Additional Charges

Reviews often provide a reality check when it comes to the final cost of a flight. While the initial fare advertised might be low, reviewers will tell you if that price is significantly inflated by mandatory extra charges. Are people complaining about exorbitant fees for checked bags, or even for carry-on bags that other airlines allow for free? Are there hidden fees for things like printing your boarding pass at the airport or making changes to your reservation? Reviewers will often detail the specific fees they encountered and whether they felt these charges were clearly disclosed during the booking process. This transparency, provided by fellow travelers, is invaluable.

Furthermore, reviews can shed light on the terms and conditions associated with a fare. Is that super-cheap fare non-refundable and non-changeable, making it risky if your plans are at all uncertain? Are there strict limitations on baggage allowances that are easily exceeded, leading to hefty fees? Reviewers will often share their experiences with the flexibility (or lack thereof) associated with different fare classes and whether the terms were clearly presented. Understanding these details *before* you book, through the experiences of others, can save you from a costly mistake.

### The Power of User-Generated Warnings

Think of reviews as a collective warning system. When multiple people complain about the same hidden fee or confusing term, it sends a clear signal that this is something to watch out for. It empowers you to ask the right questions or look for alternative options where the pricing structure is more transparent. While airlines are (slowly) getting better at disclosing fees upfront, there’s still room for improvement, and user reviews remain a powerful tool for holding them accountable. They're saying, ""Hey, just so you know, they got me with this, so be careful!"" and that kind of heads-up is worth its weight in gold. So, when you're knee-deep in those **best ticket fare reviews**, keep an eye out for any mention of unexpected charges. It could save you a pretty penny.

The Onboard Experience: From Legroom to In-Flight Service

While finding a great fare is the primary goal, the actual experience of flying a flight is pretty important too, right? After all, if you're stuck in a cramped seat with no entertainment for a transatlantic flight, that cheap fare might suddenly feel like a raw deal. This is another area where **best ticket fare reviews** provide crucial information. Passengers are often eager to share their experiences *while in the air*, giving you a sense of what to expect in terms of comfort, amenities, and service. It's like getting a sneak peek into the cabin before you even board the plane.

### The Comfort Factor: What Reviews Say About the Seats and Space

Let's be honest, legroom is a big deal, especially on longer flights. Reviews frequently mention the amount of space passengers had, the comfort of the seats, and whether the cabin felt cramped or relatively spacious. Are people complaining about their knees being jammed into the seat in front of them, or are they pleasantly surprised by the amount of room they had? Reviews can also touch upon the condition of the cabin – is it clean and well-maintained, or does it look a bit tired and worn? Little details like whether there are power outlets or USB ports at each seat, or the availability of Wi-Fi, are also often highlighted in reviews. These are the things that contribute to the overall comfort of your journey, and they’re details you can get a feel for through the experiences of others.

### Amenities and Service: The Little Things That Matter

Beyond the physical comfort of the seat, reviews often touch upon the amenities offered on a flight and the level of service provided by the cabin crew. Is there in-flight entertainment, and if so, what’s the quality and selection like? Are meals or snacks provided, and what's the verdict on their taste and quantity? Reviews will also give you a sense of the demeanor of the flight attendants – are they friendly and attentive, or do they seem less enthused to be there? These aspects might not be dealbreakers for everyone, but they can certainly enhance or detract from your overall flight experience. Reading about the experiences of other passengers gives you realistic expectations and helps you avoid disappointment.

Think about it this way: imaging you are flying to London for the first time. You found a killer deal, which is awesome! But then you read reviews for that airline, and they’re full of complaints about the ancient entertainment system that doesn’t work and the fact that they serve lukewarm instant ramen as the only food option on a long-haul flight. Knowing this beforehand manages your expectations and allows you to prepare – maybe you’ll download some movies on your tablet and pack some snacks. Reviews are like those helpful little notes you get from friends about what to pack for a trip; they just make the whole journey smoother.

Navigating the Review Landscape: Tips for Finding the Most Helpful Information

So, you're ready to dive into the world of **best ticket fare reviews**. Great! But with so much information out there, it can be a little overwhelming to know where to start and how to sift through it all. It's like trying to find your way through a bustling marketplace – lots of interesting things, but you need a plan to get what you’re looking for efficiently. Here are some practical tips for finding the most helpful and trustworthy reviews to guide your flight booking decisions.

### Where to Look: Your Review Arsenal

Don't just rely on one source of reviews. Cast a wide net! Here are some places to start your search:

1. **Major aggregating websites:** Sites like Kayak, Skyscanner, and Google Flights often incorporate reviews of both the booking process and the airlines themselves.
2. **Dedicated review platforms:** Websites like TripAdvisor, Trustpilot, and Yelp have sections dedicated to airlines and travel agencies.
3. **Airline-specific review sites:** Some websites specialize in airline reviews, offering detailed breakdowns of different carriers.
4. **Travel blogs and forums:** Look for blogs and forums related to your destination or the type of travel you’re planning. Frequent travelers often share their experiences there.
5. **Social media:** A quick search on platforms like Twitter or Facebook for the airline or booking site you're considering can reveal real-time feedback, though be mindful of the source and potential bias.

Using a combination of these sources gives you a more comprehensive view and helps you cross-reference information. If you see similar feedback appearing across multiple platforms, it's a stronger indicator of a genuine trend.

### Filtering the Noise: Identifying Trustworthy Reviews

Not all reviews are created equal! Here’s how to filter out the less helpful or potentially biased ones:

- **Look for verified reviews:** Some platforms verify that a reviewer has actually used the service they are reviewing. This isn’t foolproof, but it adds a layer of credibility.
- **Check the date of the review:** Air travel experiences can change rapidly. A review from a few months ago is likely more relevant than one from five years ago. Airlines change policies, service levels fluctuate, and aircraft are updated (or not!).
- **Consider the reviewer's history:** Does the reviewer have other reviews, and are they balanced or consistently overly positive or negative? A reviewer with a history of well-reasoned reviews on various topics is often more trustworthy.
- **Beware of overly emotional language:** While genuine frustration is real, reviews filled with excessive hyperbole or personal attacks might be less objective.
- **Look out for suspiciously similar reviews:** If you see multiple reviews with nearly identical wording, it could be a sign of fake reviews.

By being a little discerning, you can focus on the reviews that offer genuine insights.

### Asking the Right Questions

As you read reviews, keep your own priorities in mind and ask yourself:

- Are the complaints or praises relevant to *my* needs? (e.g., If you're not checking a bag, complaints about baggage fees might be less important to you).
- Do the reviews mention the specific route or type of fare I'm considering? Experiences can vary significantly depending on the destination and the class of service.
- Do the reviews align with other information I've found about the airline or booking site?

Using these questions as a filter helps you hone in on the information that is most useful for *your* specific travel plans.

The Future of Flight Reviews: AI and Beyond

The world of online reviews is constantly evolving, and technology is playing an increasingly significant role. As we look ahead, how might things change for those seeking the **best ticket fare reviews**? We're already seeing the influence of AI and machine learning, and it's likely to become even more sophisticated, potentially changing the way we access and interpret feedback on flights.

### AI-Powered Review Analysis

Imagine an AI that can analyze thousands of reviews, not just by counting keywords, but by understanding the nuances of language and sentiment. This could lead to highly summarized and insightful reports on an airline's performance across various categories – punctuality, customer service, cleanliness, etc. Instead of sifting through countless individual reviews, you might get a concise, data-driven summary of the key takeaways. This could be a game-changer for busy travelers looking for quick and reliable information. AI could identify recurring themes and statistically analyze the frequency of complaints or praises related to specific aspects of the travel experience.

### Personalized Review Recommendations

Another potential development is the rise of personalized review recommendations. Based on your past travel habits, preferences (e.g., prioritizing comfort over price, flying with pets), and even your budget, AI could potentially curate the most relevant reviews for you. This would cut down on the time spent sifting through irrelevant feedback and present you with information that is directly applicable to your needs. It's like having a personal travel concierge who knows exactly what you're looking for in a flight experience.

### The Importance of Human oversight

While AI and technology offer exciting possibilities, it's crucial to remember that human experiences are complex. The subjective nature of travel means that personal preferences and individual circumstances play a significant role in how a journey is perceived. Therefore, human oversight and the ability to still access and read individual, detailed reviews will remain important. AI can summarize and analyze, but the richness and nuance of a personal account, detailing emotions and specific interactions, still offer valuable insights that algorithms might miss. The future likely lies in a combination of sophisticated technology and accessible human-generated content, giving travelers the best of both worlds in their quest for the **best ticket fare reviews**.

Conclusion: Charting Your Course with Confidence

So there you have it. The quest for the **best ticket fare reviews** isn't just about finding the cheapest flight; it's about empowering yourself with information to make informed decisions that lead to a smoother, more predictable, and ultimately more enjoyable travel experience. By hiểu what reviews reveal – from the hidden fees to the quality of service and the likelihood of delays – you can navigate the complex world of air travel with greater confidence. Don's just jump on the lowest price you see; take a little time to do your homework, read what your fellow travelers have to say, and let their experiences guide you.

Remember, reviews are your ally in this process. They offer a peer-to-peer perspective that cuts through marketing hype and gives you a taste of reality. Whether you're using major aggregators, exploring niche forums, or anticipating the future of AI-powered review analysis, the core principle remains the same: leveraging the collective wisdom of the traveling community. So, next time you're planning a trip, make reading reviews a non-negotiable part of your process. It’s a small investment of time that can pay off big in terms of avoiding headaches and, ultimately, saving money in the long run by making choices that align with your priorities and expectations. Happy travels, and may your future flights be filled with smooth skies and positive experiences, ones you can then share in your own helpful reviews!",1,1748271696.0,flightscheap,0,1.0,False

The air is tinged with the scent of spiced chai and fallen leaves, a gentle mix of cinnamon, clove and sweet earthiness that feels like a warm hug.

You stroll through a quiet park where golden leaves flutter lazily from ancient oaks, painting the ground in a mosaic of honey, rust, and caramel. The sun filters through the branches with a gentle, honeyed glow.

In the distance, a small café invites you in with the aroma of fresh pumpkin bread and vanilla coffee. You settle by a window, wrapped in a chunky knit sweater the color of soft moss, sipping slowly and watching the world slow down around you.

Your favorite autumn playlist plays softly, acoustic guitar strings, mellow vocals and a hint of piano, each note echoing the perfect balance of introspection and quiet joy.

Later, wrapped in a warm wool blanket, you wander to a nearby lake. The water reflects the fiery sunset, a mix of rose gold and deep plum and you let yourself get lost in the stillness, feeling peaceful, grounded and a little enchanted.",1,1748271670.0,ZenHabits,0,1.0,False

Problems started last october (and i know i’m in the wrong for the next thing). I started uni in a new city and met new people, i started developing a crush on my classmate(it lasted about 2 months) and ever since then he became very jealous. I kept reassuring him that the crush is over and beer just friends (not even that really) i kept and kept reassuring. Last month we went to get coffee(classmate and i) to work on a project. He made a REALLY big deal out of it, even tho i reassured him it’s only for a project and that’s it.(i do get where he’s getting the jealousy from) 

Well last week i had my driving lesson and he went out for coffee with his friend. They talked about idk what but after we had a huge argument about a trip we’re having at school. I am getting there mainly to be with my friends and drink(because i want to spend ass much time as possible, since probably we won’t see each other after uni anymore(friends from HS). He made a big deal out of it and wanted to end the relationship ig. 

At the end of the day he apologised and said he will try to do better and fix his jealousy issues(we’ve been trying to fix it for months). He acted quite mean towards me and idk if i can except the apology(truly i don’t think he will change). 

Should i end the relationship?
EDIT: I NEVER cheated or was close to it, me and the classmate talked only about school and that’s it. we just happen to have a project together. I believe the “crush” happened because i came to a new environment and met new people.",1,1748271650.0,whatdoIdo,1,1.0,False
1kvwhqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kvwhqx/ive_reached_out_after_three_months/,I’ve reached out after three months,"
I (M29) texted my ex (22F) after 3 months of no contact..we broke up cause both our mental health was getting worse, and there was no possibility to carry on the relationship.. nowadays I’m feeling much better, and this is how the chat with her went:

Me: Ciao bella, I hope you’re doing well. I’m not sure if you’ll be happy to hear from me, but it’s a risk I’m willing to take because I’ve always cared about you—and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with reaching out just to ask how you’re doing.
It’s been a while since we went our separate ways, and I genuinely hope this time has brought you some peace.
If you’re open to it, I’d appreciate having a chat at some point—over the phone, or even over a coffee. Only if you’re comfortable, of course. If not, no hard feelings—I’ll completely respect your space 😁

Enjoy the rest of your day 😊

Her: Ciao, I'm not doing too bad thank you. I'm happy to have a chat over the phone whenever you free. I just want to be clear that this will not change my decision.

Have a good evening and speak to you soon. 😊


Me: Glad to hear that 🙂

Yes no worries, i appreciate your honesty, but it’s not my intention to change your decision..i just thought friendly conversation could be good for both of us, just a catch up with no pressure 🙂

So I’ll let you know when I’ll get some free time over the weekend or beginning next week maybe, and if you’ll have time for it 😁

Her: Okay that's fine with me, I am free over weekend so let me know what time is best 😊


What do u think about it?

Ps, I was busy with work so i couldn’t call her, so i texted her last night apologising that i didn’t have time to do so, and if she could have a chat at some point this week..

1kvwhhv,https://i.redd.it/m4gqr2vcx43f1.jpeg,H: An un-optimized build W: Your help to optimized it,"Started playing a month ago and got super hooked into playing it. Not sure how to ask for help, but here are some context of what I got going on so far.   
  
My legendary perks are S,E,C,I,A,L (all rank 5). Currently running a set of SS Unyielding, INT, Thru-Hiker, Ranger on each of the 5 pcs.   
  
In terms of weapon, I tend to alternate between the Gatling Gun (Furious, Rapid, V.A.T.S Optimized, Pin-pointer) & Holy Fire (Furious, Rapid, Durability, Pyromaniac).   
  
Even tho I have a Gatling Plasma with Stinging Core Receptacle and Accelerated Nozzle on it, I do not use it because I don't own the Plasma Core Recharger as I dislike managing with hundreds of un-fully charged cores. I'm okay with the Gatling Laser as I do have the Fusion Core Recharger and I can charge to store them in my ammo box (sitting at 500 cores atm).

In terms of mutation, I have these:  
Adrenal Reaction  
Bird Bones  
Carnivore  
Chameleon  
Egg Head  
Electrically Charged  
Herd Mentality  
Marsupial  
Plague Walker  
Speed Demon  
Unstable Isotope  
  
(Thinking of getting Twisted Muscles so I can benefit from the spread to the Cremator when I eventually get it, cus from what i understand the Gun accuracy -50% helps cover more area. Although not sure how much it's going to affect other weapons)

Speaking slightly about mutation, are there any recommended ones to get?

The reason why I went with Carnivore is because of convenience, as I picked up Mirelurk Steamer for it's ""Smoked Mirelurk Fillets"" for the Carry Weight. As for other C.A.M.P items that benefits my character (that I can think of) , I have the Company Tea Machine and the Coffee Machine.

With all that said, I wonder if any of the perk cards listed is redundant or can be swapped for another?

Thanks!

PS:   
  
Also a bit unrelated, I learnt that I do not have to stay on top of my foundry smelter, radiation barrel, toxic goo or slime cake to drop my health to 20% as I can use the Gamma Gun with Bloodied, Hitman, Lucky (planning to change), and Polished that I got on it.  
  
How can I make the Gamma Gun shoot once to drop my health to 20%. As of right now whenever I died, I respawn with 25% health, and a single shot of my Gamma Gun brings it down to 20.5%.   
  
From what I read (Correct me if I'm wrong), Polished doesn't work when it's 200%. But for whatever reason, not sure if it's a bug, no matter how much I shoot with the Gamma Gun, the condition always show 200%. Or maybe is there a better 4\* I can replace it with?

The air is tinged with the scent of spiced chai and fallen leaves, a gentle mix of cinnamon, clove and sweet earthiness that feels like a warm hug.

You stroll through a quiet park where golden leaves flutter lazily from ancient oaks, painting the ground in a mosaic of honey, rust, and caramel. The sun filters through the branches with a gentle, honeyed glow.

In the distance, a small café invites you in with the aroma of fresh pumpkin bread and vanilla coffee. You settle by a window, wrapped in a chunky knit sweater the color of soft moss, sipping slowly and watching the world slow down around you.

Your favorite autumn playlist plays softly, acoustic guitar strings, mellow vocals and a hint of piano, each note echoing the perfect balance of introspection and quiet joy.

It stopped after I changed my email password so I assume he had my password somehow.  Also he studies cyber security.  He continued to stalk my socials afterwards and is now blocked on everything.  This was about a year ago now.  I was looking at all my blocked numbers and found these messages that I never sent.  It says its from AT&T, in the message it says it from VZW which I assume is Verizon wireless.  Neither of which is my phone service.  I NEVER sent these messages.  The ""I'm sorry I understand"" was the last message my ex sent me before I blocked his number.  It then resends the message months later.  I then unblocked his number to tell him to stop stalking my socials and reblocked him.  There is no messages from AT&T when I did that. The ""which state are you living?"" Was the last text message from a wrong number I blocked not too long ago.  It was obviously a scam, they offered to buy me coffee for inconveniencing me.  I've blocked many other numbers on this phone before and their messages are not in there.  I am just SO confused.  The dates are also off.  I blocked my ex on Jul 10th not 12th and I blocked that other number on April 2nd not 3rd.

1kvwdy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kvwdy0/how_do_i_make_healthy_whole_milk_from_skimmed/,How do I make healthy whole milk from skimmed?,"I have a buddy that crashes at mine fairly often when he's working in this part of the country.  
He had some heart issues, but he has to be careful of his food intake. He eats keto with low-carb, high protein+fat, but it's not how I eat, so I make food that's a middle ground. A lot more meat for his needs, but some veg for me so I don't get meat sweats.  
It's helping him stay on track, but it really doesn't suit what I need. I used to have meat only 3-4 meals a week and I recently had a call from my doc after an annual checkup to advise me to get back to my old dietary intake.

Coffee:

When it comes to coffee my buddy likes full-fat milk in his lattes where I normally have skimmed in a flat white. So rather than buying milk just for him (and then drink the rest when he's gone), I had an idea of making fat milk by adding healthy oil to the skimmed to recreate the 4% fat of whole milk.  
But using a [healthier fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil#Composition_of_fats) than dairy.

So I did an experiment today where I added some avocado oil to skimmed milk to make my morning flat white. The milk texture was great. Very silky and ""wet paint"" like you get with fat milk and it made for easy flowing latte art with no need to fuss the milk to integrate the foam like I sometimes do with basic skimmed.

But I could taste the oil in it. Not unpleasant, but it was there as an aftertaste.

Next time I'll be testing olive oil. I'm expecting it to be more pronounced on the palette, but I'm hoping it to be less of an ""oil"" aftertaste.

Has anyone tried this already?  
If yes, can you recommend an oil that has little to no flavour to it?

Hence the thread. If I missed any thread that was applicable to my need, please let me know.

I am looking for a Machine, either Coffee Maker or Tea maker. I will be using it exclusively for making Tea and do not intend to ever use it to make coffee. (Yes I know once you put coffee in it the tea would smell like Coffee) My Key Criteria are .

1. I only need to boil loose leaf Tea Powder. (No milk, no merely boiling water to put over tea bags.)
2. Must be able to use my own powder and make two cups at the minimum at a time.
3. Don't like plastic Water Reservoir. In other words, prefer that the boiling water be housed in anything but plastic.
4. Prefer that the Powder be steeped in the boiling water. Unlike traditional coffee making where merely pouring hot water over the Powder is sufficient. Kind of like boiling the powder on Stove, except in Electric machine.

Since I need more than one cup at a time, Keurig is out because as far as I can tell, it makes one cup at a time regardless of model. Also I did consider espresso machines recommendations here, but since I won't be using milk, those don't seem applicable. Same goes for Frother.

The platform’s still relatively new and community-driven, but that’s part of what makes it feel real – not some massive gig economy machine. Just people sharing what they’re good at (or want to learn) and finding matches.

Say hi and give me some hope—new to this, one week in…","**TL;DR** Anything I should or shouldn’t do or consume? Do coffee or alcohol matter? I’ve noticed poor sleep makes it worse. Any thoughts appreciated.

Hi all, not sure what to write here tbh, but I’m looking for tips—or, quite frankly, anything you think might help.

Got home from work a week ago, laid down to relax, and heard a constant sound—like the TV was on but muted, if that makes sense. I covered my ears, put in earplugs, turned off all the power in my place, but it wouldn’t go away. I felt like I was going insane, so I did what every sensible person does: self-diagnosis via the internet. Needless to say, that didn’t help.

I barely slept with worry. The next day I was super depressed, missed work, and felt exhausted. The following day I went to the hospital; they said nothing was wrong with my ears but gave me a high one-week dose of prednisone (a corticosteroid).

A couple of days later, nothing had changed. I managed to get a last-minute appointment with a specialist. They said there’s nothing they can do—literally: “There’s nothing wrong with your ears. Take the meds and hope for the best; in most cases it clears up in a few weeks or months.”

I’m exhausted but less worried. I’ve weirdly started to get used to it, but at times it’s really intense and… well, you probably know what that feels like.

I’m back at work—no headphones—and I use noise-reduction earplugs when I expect a lot of noise. Not even sure if that’s the right thing to do; my doctor and specialist were, frankly, pretty useless.

So, is there anything I should or shouldn’t do or consume? Do coffee or alcohol make a difference? I’ve realised not sleeping well makes it worse. Any thoughts appreciated.

So, I actually snagged all this a couple of weeks ago, but I’ve had a chance to use a lot of these products now, so here’s a scattered review…

Hopped off the fence on soo many picks this haul — I’ve been going back and forth on Sakura BS for literally months and I’m so glad I pulled the trigger. It’s a really nice light floral to layer with sprays like Mossy Bottom or GOTF. Really like it. Same with Bitzer!! Both of them smell so much different outside of the store AND so different from what I usually get, in the best way. I actually made an online order last night and there’s 2 more Bitzers on their way to me.. i love him 🥹

Easter Bonnet was also one I’ve picked up and put back half a dozen times — I chopped it into chunks and it ended up lasting for like, 4 baths, and I’m obsessed with the scent (is it a particular scent family?!) so it was definitely a good buy.

I am completely blown away by Retread—I don’t dig the scent and it feels sooo thin compared to the Banana conditioner I’ve been using, but my hair has never looked so amazing. And if you were in the “your darkest lush confessions” thread, you’ll know how I got that Bee’s Knees tester 😂 

The brazilian boom was a bit of a surprise hit with a really unique scent and I love the coffee addition. And I’m not sure about the Coco Loco because that and the shampoo bar were my husband’s picks!  

Also have to give a huge shout out to the Oak Park KC Lush — they are starting to recognize me 😅 but are always so insanely friendly and didn’t even flinch when I started my sample requests. I need to submit a formal compliment or something, everyone is always so helpful (There’s one employee there who is THE BEST! She has the best suggestions— Tumeric Roll IS amazing, girl!!) and they hook me up every time! I’ve been using the Gorgeous sample which was a mistake, because the price for a full tub is just too much. But I’ve almost sampled every face wash in my journey to find the perfect one… what’s everyone’s favorite?

The toothpaste was a feeebie they threw in at the counter and I probably won’t use it 😅 I’m weird about my teeth, but it does smell really good!

Let me start by saying, this countertop appliance is geared toward those who genuinely love nugget ice, aka the soft, chewable kind that's perfect for drinks, cocktails, and even food preservation. As someone who enjoys an iced coffee every morning and occasional margaritas in the evening, this product had me intrigued. I’ve thoroughly used it, tested its functions, and here's my honest take on it.

**Sleek Design with Practical Dimensions**  
The stainless steel body stands out with a premium and polished look. Measuring 13 x 9 x 16 inches, it has a compact build, perfect for sitting on most countertops without dominating the entire space. The 33.5-pound weight means it's solid but still manageable to move around if needed. From a visual standpoint, it blends seamlessly into modern kitchens, offices, or even a home bar setup. The touch interface on the front is minimalistic yet straightforward to operate, which is a big plus if you’re not a tech-savvy person.

**User-Friendly Control Panel**  
Speaking of ease of use, the intuitive touch interface is perhaps one of this machine's key offerings. The four illuminated buttons inform you of the machine's operation status. The blue light indicates self-cleaning, the green signifies a full ice basket, red means low water, and white confirms ice production. For someone occasionally forgetful like me, this system acts as a simple guide on when to refill water, empty the basket, or clean. It minimizes guesswork and keeps the process stress-free.

[Check Totnz GF-IM30T-US price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dlgz9m9n/)

**A Steady Ice Supply for Demanding Days**  
With a capacity of producing up to 44 pounds of nugget ice daily, this machine ensures an unbroken supply of ice for heavy users. Whether I’m entertaining guests or just trying to stay cool in the sweltering summer, it’s never short on delivery. The 2.6-pound storage basket combined with its quick 7-minute production cycle has been particularly impressive. You no longer have to run out to grab pricey bags of ice or deal with mediocre standard freezing trays.

**Customizable Schedule for Convenience**  
It features a 12-hour timer, which might sound basic but is actually genius. I’ll share one experience: I scheduled it to make ice overnight so that I woke up to a freshly prepared batch for my morning routine. That feature is particularly useful if you anticipate high usage during the day or want ice ready at particular times, such as parties or family dinners.

**Chewable Nugget Ice with Delightful Texture**  
This machine produces precisely what it promises—soft, chewable ice nuggets that beat your standard cubes if you’re a texture-snob like me. There’s something satisfying about this pebble texture, which meliorates drinks without watering them down quickly. My kids and even my coworker absolutely adore it, and it's been a game-changer for summer drinks and cocktails alike.

**Hands-Free, Automated Cleaning**  
We probably all dread cleaning tasks. Luckily, the built-in self-cleaning function saves hours of unnecessary scrubbing. A simple touch completes the cleaning process in about 15 minutes. However, I still recommend doing a deep manual clean occasionally to avoid clogging or mineral build-up, especially if your local water isn’t filtered.

**Key Benefits**  
- Sleek stainless steel design matches any space.  
- Produces 44 lbs of fresh ice daily and stores 2.6 lbs at a time.  
- Quickly creates ice in as little as 7 minutes.  
- User-friendly control panel with clear and helpful illumination indicators.  
- Time-saving self-cleaning mechanism.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Fairly heavy at 33.5 pounds, which may limit portability.  
- While the self-cleaning is convenient, an occasional manual clean still feels necessary.  
- The water tank’s capacity might not suit extremely high-demand use cases without frequent refilling.  

**Competitive Options in the Market**  
Compared to others in its league, this nugget ice maker has a distinct edge with its quick-acting cycle and nugget-style ice. For example, products like the GE Opal Nugget Ice Maker also boast top-tier performance but at a significantly heftier price point. While the GE Opal might have Bluetooth connectivity for scheduling, I found the Totnz model’s simpler 12-hour timer more intuitive without dealing with app setups. On the other hand, cheaper models tend to lack stainless steel construction or reliable longevity. In sheer sturdiness and solid daily performance, this product edges ahead.

**Smart Spending**  
Is it worth the investment? Given its durable stainless steel build, consistent ice quality, and its user-friendly design, I’d say this machine offers great cost-effectiveness. Even for households who might not use it daily, the convenience and simple operation make it a smart mid-tier choice. You’ll cut out endless bagged ice purchases while enjoying chewable, restaurant-style nuggets at home.

This is your sign to have an alarm clock that isn’t on your phone. 

This is your sign not to trust yourself enough just to use a ~regular~ alarm setting.

No you can’t have even one overtired night. One tiny misstep… where you accidentally set 2 alarms instead of 5.

Not one second where you forget to use that alarm clock that makes you do math equations or take a photo of your dumb morning face holding a coffee in order to turn it off. One that crawls across the room. One that stands up and hits you across the face.

When I completed my college I fell in love with a guy and we decided to get married after my pregnancy.

I changed my career to banking and stopped all my acting work. 24 years later after all our kids became adults I decided to take a break from my job and give the play another try. My husband (50M) supported me through this and even encouraged.

I said so to a friend from college that I want to restart the acting and she was bit skeptical at first. Then I asked her if she can recommend me to someone for a small role even. I didnt hear from her for few weeks and then one day she asked me to meet for a coffee.

Where she said she has got a surprise for me and said I will get to meet someone. She said she got the recommendation after pulling lot of contacts and that I would love it. So I was excited but had no clue what I was looking forward to.

She took me to theatre directors office and when I read tha name I was shocked. He was a famous play director who directed famous and award winning plays. She waited outside and I went to see him. He recognised my name and said that he got a recommendation from so and so but that he was not sure I would be able to act after such a huge gap.

I was feeling little low and then he asked if I am still comfortable on stage. He then out of nowhere said I should get naked and he will decide if I can even be given a chance. To his credit his plays often involve nudity mostly for artistic reasons. I also didnt want to disappoint my friend and her contact who got me this chance to meet him. So I undressed, and there were some other theatre folks too so I wasnt that uncomfortable. He has asked me to meet with his casting director which is a hope.

I didnt want to keep this from my husband and told him how the audition went. He was really pissed that I stripped infront of bunch of people for no reason and that I abandoned my shame for some hobby. Which really hurt because he was encouraging me to persue it but now called it just a hobby. I am little hurt but he is not talking to me since.

I rise and stumble my way into the kitchen where the crack of opening a beer can eases all my worries. These days beer is cheaper than water and a quarter of the price of food so out with the daily bread and in with the daily beer. Society likes it better when people like me walk around half drunk in a daze all day. I might not work as hard as when I'm sober but I ask a lot less questions and are far more agreeable. The people with money don't drive expensive cars or wear tons of jewelry they walk and talk just like the rest of us. However, when I have brief moments of sobriety before bed I can remember what makes them different. 

The whites of their eyes are so white because their livers are not irreparably damaged by the time they are thirty. They have straight teeth, clothes with no tags, and the shoes no man, women, or child can fake the shoes. They are always perfectly clean besides a small scuff that was sold with the shoes as a way of projecting to their other rich friends that they can relate to our struggle. I don't remember the last time I tasted fresh meat I have lived on rice and beans ever sense I was a child and the idea of throwing away food seemed alien. Yet, I saw on the news this morning that coffee sales in gentrified neighborhoods are down 10% could this be a recession indicator? 

They blame us for taking a government social program that only gets us food and say its too much. They tell us to have children but tell them they are not entitled to a free meal at school. As soon as the controlling party gets affected they keep people under informed about issues in their own communities and over inform the population on whatever is bothering white people who make over 100k a year. Conditional empathy is not empathy if you cry over people getting shot overseas but feel nothing about the people who starve to death in this country every year than you are just a manipulator. 

Approximately 13 thousand people die of starvation every year in the US. That is drastically more than historical events that have led to wars. That is because if a rich man's ideology is challenged we agree to lie down our lives and liberty for the country, but will not do the same for working class collective values. My argument is that having people without homes and starving to death in the most prosperous country in all of human history should be considered a crime against humanity. Tax the rich and use the money to at least make sure no one dies of starvation, not everyone deserves their freedom but everyone deserves to keep fighting another day.

I guess it's about tonality, but I just don't remember how to hang out with people. Normally I just let the people ask me, but this one time someone had said hey you should totally join us for karaoke, but I was awkward and said ""yyeeeahhhh maybeee"". I feel so bad. I feel like I sounded rude, and they were someone I wanted to hang out with, but I feel like I would be inviting myself to something that was mentioned more than half a year ago. I just feel so socially inept and am slightly beginning to sound desperate.

Then once I do make a friend after a while, I'm not sure what to talk about. I don't keep up with the news or politics, I've asked already \* what have you been up to? How's your career? How's college? How's your love life? \* (Maybe I should leave off with )etc. I try not to complain or talk crap about people. During covid I was struggling with my mental health. I've gotten better since, but it's like when we go down memory lane I can't remember for the life of me what happened, even now I struggle a little. I mean I feel bad, but like what do people talk about?! How do I keep a conversation with people? I mainly overthink what to ask too. One of my friends will work on a project and I'll be ""oh cool! what's this for? How does it work?"" or even they'll talk about some job they got and I'll be like ""oh what do you do there?... oh interesting!"". If it's a grocery store job, I feel stupid asking that. One can figure, they stock shelves or are at the cash register. An internship, one can guess getting coffee or running errands. Or I feel stupid cause these are possible movie situations. I'm 20 years old, I should know that's not how it works, but I don't know what else to ask.

Even how often should I keep in contact with people? I mean we are all busy since most of my friends are in college, but also, I just know a lot of people and it gets tiring trying to contact everyone. 3 months I am in school, and I would like to work on school work, but once there is a moment where I can rest I'd like to just relax.

Monroe worked with Charles Pinckney to try negotiate the deal. Ultimately the mission was a failure as Spain refused to cede the land. Monroe would begin to leave Spain 220 years ago today, May 26th.

Here is what Monroe wrote of his first night in Spain after traveling from France through the Pyrenees on mules:

""I entered the best tavern, with our mules, the ground floor of which was given up to them. I ascended to the second, thro a mass of filth on the stair case, into an apartment that exhaled a flavor that was hugely of-fensive. In the apartment were six or eight young men of different na-tions, Spaniards, and Portuguese & French, who had been detained there sometime on account of the yellow fever, which was at Cadiz & some other posts. I felt an inexpressible desire to get out of the house and procure other lodgings as soon as possible.""

Soon the Danish ambassador to Madrid, Count Edmund Burke, would find Monroe and brought him to his house. Monroe was treated to a fine dinner and a decent night's rest. The following morning, with ""a cup of coffee to take"" with him, Monroe and his entourage continued their trip through the Pyrenees. 

Traveling through the mountains, Monroe came to a pass ""more frightful than anything we can boast of"" in America:

""The passage itself is narrow & on each side, are stupendous promonto-ries of naked rock, which altho they excite no apprehension of over-whelming you by their fall, yet their vast elevation & cragged form, compress on the mind the most painful sensation.""",3,1748270325.0,James_Monroe,0,1.0,False

So I started working as a ""waiter/bartender/barista"" at a newly opened coffee & brunch place, with no experience and close to no knowledge. Before opening we had 1 day training for making coffee and bartendering, so we know what we're doing at least on a basic level.

I love coffee and I was always eyeing this kind of job, so I wanna get as good as possible. In the future I'm planning on going for an actual barista course (once I find one I can complete next to my work), but for now, it's ""self teaching"".

We're using lightly roasted, dry brazilian coffee and a Sanremo D8 machine with only one program for double shots. Our way is: 17 g of coffee ground into 38 g of coffee in 25-30 seconds. Our grinder is also pre-programmed to give us 17g (+/-0.4g), so the only thing we can change is how finely the machine grinds the coffee.

Where should I start looking? Found James Hoffman on YT, he seems good. What should I watch out for? Any mistakes to avoid at all times?

Things we've been thought:

-How to make coffee (duh)

-Keep the portafilter in the machine so it doesn't cool off.

-How to steam milk (get some air in it, tilt, whisk)

-How to clean the machine (tho cleaning the steamwands at the end of the day is unclear to me)

**Why This Pick?**

Not only do I think the Cubs can bag 8 runs over the Rockies by themselves, but Jameson Taillon (4.13 ERA) is far from Chicago's best starter (sorry dude, it’s not personal…) As bad as the Rockies have been, I do think they’ll bag 2-3 off of Taillon today – which, cuts Chicago’s workload down to only needing to bag about 5 or 6 runs. The Cubs’ offense is far too explosive to safely wager Under 7.5 against any squad in my opinion. And with Colorado starting Carson Palmquist (11.88 ERA), I think there’s a good chance Chicago cashes the total on their own. I’m on the Over today.

As in, I do the cold brewing in a French press then push the press mesh down and pour the coffee into the V60 for filtering. Avoids having an entirely separate device.

But my problem is that the paper filter gets clogged at the end. I tried pouring the remaining unfiltered liqued into a cup and replacing the filter (duly wetting it with hot water over the sink, of course). But the new filter immediately clogs up again and the flow turns to a slow drip. A small part of the liquid never gets through at all.

What should I be doing differently to avoid this? Or is it ""just how things are"" with a ""french press plus V60"" approach?

It would be cool if these events are influenced by events happening in game, such as Indonesia (#3 Coffee producer) being embroiled in a huge war, thus making the prices rise.

I'm new here and I'm very glad I discovered this group. I was diagnosed with EBV a year ago. A week ago I had a blood test, where it was found that the antibodies are very high and the nodes are still swollen.

There are days when the nodes shrink and sometimes they are actively swollen, the USG result was that they are reactive.

This virus is destroying me mentally, because I don't know exactly what's wrong with me and especially WHY and where I got this virus.
I feel frustrated, my neck is constantly stiff, I don't really know what's wrong with me or how to treat it, I'm often disgusted and in a bad mood.

I have an appointment to the Otolaryngologist in two weeks. 

I eat healthy, I eat a lot of vegetables and fruits, I usually eat chicken or turkey meat.
I have been active in sports all my life, 2-3 times a week strength training, pilates, walks and stretching. Depending on the weather, I also bike, skate, etc.

Here I read that coffee should be limited, I drink it 2 times a day, from tomorrow I don't plan to do that anymore.

Vitamins: 
D3, 2000IU Omega 3, C, Zinc, magnesium, calcium and the next day I also take L-lysine. 

My symptoms:
Swollen nodes, there are days when I am very tired, nothing else. 

Please, what do you recommend to change or add? What foods to eat and avoid?

What other examinations have you undergone? &Thank you everyone and I wish everyone lots of love and happiness 🙏

She'll clear the coffee table once a week. Confronting her about the damage only leads to more wagging. I'm at a loss as to why she insists on wagging so much. Can anyone help? Most recently she wagged one of the blinds right off the patio door while doing her ""welcome home Mom"" dance. Anyone else have a destructively happy Golden?

Now nearing completion, this **11-floor marvel** stands proudly as the tallest building on the east side of West Street. And while it may not be the most towering of landmarks, it certainly has a presence—and not the kind of presence I had hoped.

The renderings promised us a design full of *dynamic contrasts*—green, glass, and brick, all woven together in a way that would blend seamlessly with the neighborhood. Instead, what we got is a building that looks as though it was designed with the same panache as a cardboard box, covered in beige, and generously sprayed with foam. Yes, foam. So much foam, in fact, that it’s wafted through the air like confetti at a particularly uninspired New Year’s Eve party. Not exactly the kind of celebratory arrival we were hoping for.

And then there are the **air conditioning units**, hundreds, placed *perched* on pedestals on every balcony. Ah, yes, a classic touch of modernity. Because nothing says ""contemporary living"" like the constant hum of industrial machinery right next to your morning coffee. To be clear, this design choice was previously reserved for buiildings of the *pre-A/C era*, except with the added benefit of being all beige and made out of foam.

I’m told there will be no street level commerce.

Of course, we’re all being asked to accept the notion that new buildings = progress. But let’s be real: this is not progress, it’s a cheap knockoff of what could’ve been. A structure so bereft of character, style, or even a basic respect for humanity that it could’ve been designed by a DOS program running on low energy. It’s a step forward, certainly—but a step backward in just about every other respect.

So, what do we think, Greenpoint?

1kvvkfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepapinis/comments/1kvvkfq/sherri_papinis_constant_leg_rubbing_in_interviews/,Sherri Papini’s constant leg rubbing in interviews,"I noticed, while looking at earlier interview videos with detectives that she constantly holds her legs and rubs them. When looking up what it means it had several reasons why, except in the earlier videos she now claims she was lying. Looked it up,

""4. Deception or Concealment:
Distraction: In some cases, leg rubbing could be a deliberate attempt to distract the interviewer from noticing other body language cues or inconsistencies in their story.
Anxiety related to deception: If someone is being dishonest, they might experience increased anxiety, which could manifest in physical behaviors like leg rubbing. However, this should not be taken as a sole indicator of deception."" 

Suddenly she is claiming to tell the truth and here we are again with holding the legs. It's so odd when she does it, that is why it's so noticeable. Stop being a liar, especially when you have weird tricks that you can't keep yourself from displaying. I noticed they gave her a coffee cup in one of them, they clearly wanted to keep her from rubbing her legs because they had other therapists there who were looking for lying behaviors. They know she is being analyzed and that is one of the behaviors for being deceptive.",2,1748269235.0,thepapinis,2,0.67,False
