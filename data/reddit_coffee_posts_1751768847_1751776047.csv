1lssj6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lssj6a/whats_your_opinion_51m_vs_47f_married_life_360/,"What’s your opinion? 51M vs. 47F  married,  life 360","My husband ( 51M ) and I ( 47F ) just got married 2 months ago. It’s a second marriage for both of us. We both have kids from our first marriages that have (almost) all but flown the nest. 
   
    First let me say that I love my husband to pieces. We have been with each other for 6 years and we are literally best friends. We both have a similar sense of humor and we find the weirdest things to be hilarious. We share a lot of the same interests and most of our long term goals are in sink with the other. 

   He filed for divorce from his first wife because she cheated on him. She even admitted this much to me when I met her for coffee one day. (I know.. sounds strange, but Long story short, I met him when he was separated from his wife, living separately and had already filed for divorce. But after two or three dates, I knew I really liked him but I needed to be certain I wasn’t being played by a guy who might be telling me a story about how “he was getting divorced”. I needed to make sure I wasn’t be played for a fool by a two timer. So I secretly contacted her, met her for coffee, told her I had the utmost respect for marriage and would never pursue anything with him if she still had hopes of working on her marriage to him. That’s when she told me that she had cheated on him and didn’t love him. She told me he was a great guy though and she gives us her blessing.) 

   Anyways, ya. So she cheated on him, which, for anyone who’s been cheated on, you feel the pinch of that for a long time after. It’s hard to trust people when you’ve been tricked and lied to by someone you loved and thought you could trust more than anyone. He filed divorce on her when he found out. A year later, we met. 


   I was already divorced by that point. I filed for divorce from my husband because he became hyper obsessed with accusing me of cheating for two years. It was the longest two years of my life. I NEVER cheated on him or any of my relationships before that. I loved him more than anything. I don’t believe in cheating and I pride myself in being a woman of integrity. I would break up with someone long before I’d ever cheat on them. And even though it might be possible to cheat on a spouse without them finding out, if I cheated on him, there’s no way I could escape from knowing that about myself. I would feel so low about myself. I just wouldn’t cheat. I never have and I never would. My moral conviction on its wrongfulness is just something I’ve never wavered on. 

I loved my husband to pieces. I was proud and honored to be his wife. I wanted him to get better so our marriage would heal and get strong again, but his paranoia and delusions of me cheating on him morphed into this evil beast that consumed him a little more each day. It got ugly; real ugly. His accusations were over the top and not logical or even remotely realistic. 

   It all started when I went from being a stay at home mom to waitressing at a family restaurant a few nights a week for some supplemental income. He hated having me leave the house and right from day one, he said “this is the beginning of the end”. He told me that all women who work outside the home end up cheating on their husbands. It was just a matter of time. It saddened me that he was worried about that, but I tried my best to assure him that I would never ever cheat on him. But he was convinced it was inevitable and nothing would change his mind. 

    Over the course of the next two years, the accusations became almost daily. The interrogations, more invasive and outlandish. He started taking measures he thought would bust me cheating. He secretly installed a keyboard tracker on our home computer to catch me writing emails to men. 8 months after, when he had been reading everything I ever wrote on the computer and found no such evidence of infidelity, rather than admit he was wrong, he said I must have “partitioned the hard drive” and the sectioned segment I secretly used was protected from his tracker. I barely knew how to send an email at the time. But he wouldn’t hear of anything unless it confirmed what he was convinced of. So he hauled our home computer yo the Apple computer people and told them he needed to find the proof that I was in contact with men. (Mind you, I had 4 children at the time, all under 7 and 2 of which were in diapers) Anyways, the computer analysts charged him $800 and told them they didn’t find anything to support his fears about me. 
That’s when he came home in tears, confessed he had put a tracker on the computer and came clean about the computer people not finding anything. He apologized, begged me to forgive him and promised he’d change. Of course I forgave him, but the next day he’d be back at it. The next week he said he discovered my secret porn sight. As he confronted me with these images of headless nude women telling me that he knows it’s my body, I pointed out some major discrepancies with that accusation. This lady was missing some key freckles and moles that are very prominent on me and gained some in places I don’t have any. Of course he dismissed this as a trivial detail and said that I had probably learned how to airbrush photos… and apparently I was getting very creative too. 

He began to review my phone calls on a nightly basis. He’d log into Verizon online and pull up the phone calls under my number. On the rare occasion I didn’t recall who the number belonged to, he’d have me call the number right in front of him. I felt a little weird doing it, but I knew I wasn’t hiding anything. One time it was the tire department because he asked me that morning to get some quotes. One time it was a kids consignment store I had been to. The night time phone call reviews became integrated into our evening activities as if it was totally normal. 

Then he had me bring in my clock-in/clock-out slips from work to prove I had been there and not out with a secret boyfriend. Somehow that eventually wasn’t enough for him and I had to also call him from my work number when I got there and before I left. 

Then he secretly put a gps tracker in my car… twice. I had no idea about it until he accused me of having sex after work in the cvs parking lot during my 5 minute detour from work to home. But he had forgotten that that morning he had asked me to pick up a few things after work. 

The name calling escalated and the accusations became so far fetched that the only person who was convinced they were true was him. Even In the absence of any evidence to support his claim of my infidelity, he religiously interrogated me and accused me of the most hurtful, dirty things. And it was especially hurtful because I was trying to be a good wife to him. I took care of our young children all day and worked a few nights to help our finances. I loved him, but his paranoia got the best of him and slowly deteriorated the character of the man I had fallen in love with. I knew I didn’t deserve to be treated the way he was treating me and I knew my kids deserved better than to see/hear their dad call their mom horrible things and to lie about me. 

I wrote a letter to doctor Phil begging for help and explaining that I was on my last straw. I wanted to save my marriage and my family but I was at my breaking point. I needed help. I asked doctor Phil if there was any way he could have his polygrapher hook me up and he could ask me all the questions about cheating. I figured then I could prove to my husband that I didn’t do even 1 of the things he had accused me of for the past two years. 

The producers wrote me back and called me back and after about a month of going back and forth with collecting additional info, they officially invited us to be on the show. 

Both my husband and I were thrilled thinking that this would be a fresh start for us. For the first time in a long time, I had some tangible hope that things could and would only get better from here. This emotional torment might finally end. I was exhausted, but elated at the opportunity. We both were. 

But a week before we were supposed to board our plans for the show, my husband said he refused to participate if the lie detector guy was going to be there. I didn’t get it because that woulda been a great way to know for sure that I didn’t cheat or text or call or email any guy ever. But something about the lie detector test made him get cold feet. Then he just said no, he changed his mind and wouldn’t be going to the show. 
So that was it for me. That night I told him to pack his bags and get lost. I filed for divorce the next morning. 

So now, I have this awesome guy who I’ve been with for 6 years and just married. Well recently, he thought it would be a great idea to get life 360 on our phones.  I know a lot of couples use that and find it even helpful at times. He argues that it’s great for emergencies or to know if I got forced into a double shift at work. (I can’t bring my phone on the floor with me; it has to stay in the work locker) so with life 360, even if I cannot text him to tell him I got forced onto a double, he can just log into 360 and confirm this for himself. 

   I told him I’d do it on a trial basis, but that I find it very creepy. And I still have it on but I just have an unsettling knot in the pit of my stomach ever since. I feel a little less excited about being married to him now. I know it’s probably just some left over trauma from what I dealt with from my ex, but I just feel like it’s just a matter of time before I’m being questioned about things. He has a very sedentary, very boring position in his company. He basically sits there watching YouTube all day. So I know for a fact he is sitting there watching my car drive to work, the grocery store or wherever. And I know in his case, it’s probably out of extreme boredom. But it doesn’t change the fact that I am on the receiving end of it. I have zero privacy. Every place I might happen to stop at, I could be subject to an interrogation over. And I know that a lot of people are of the belief that if you aren’t up to anything shady, then you have nothing to hide. But bring on the butt end of that for so many years, I know how crappy it feels to be interrogated when you did nothing wrong to deserve the interrogation. If I have done nothing except for being a loving, loyal, hard working, responsible, faithful wife, then I shouldn’t have to be tracked and I did nothing to justify losing basic privacies that everyone is entitled to without having to explain every move you make. 

I dunno. I’ll be amazed if anyone made it this far. I know I can get carried away, but I was just hoping to glean some perspective/opinions. Do you guys like being gps tracked like a disobedient teenager who’s got a curfew to abide by? 
I just feel so discouraged already. 

It makes me just want to throw away my phone. I know if I tell him that I hate the app, he’s gonna piss and moan about it because bottom line, he just wants to track me. His ex cheated on him so deep down, I think it gives him some peace of mind to know exactly where I am. But unfortunately, I was with a guy who constantly accused me of doing something evil… that I was 100% innocent of. ",1,1751775887.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1lssiqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1lssiqi/my_gerd_journey_how_i_found_my_ultimate_trigger/,"My GERD Journey, how I found my ultimate trigger, and how my dentist may have inadvertently caused my esophageal erosion","Hi everybody,

I have been a GERD sufferer since February 2024, and while I'm relatively new to the club it's been a miserable time. About a month ago though, I was finally able to put the biggest piece of my GERD trigger puzzle together so I wanted to share a bit about my journey and my triggers in hopes that it might help someone.

A little background, I'm a 35 year old white male with a BMI of 31. Prior to my GERD diagnosis I was a spicy food, black coffee, and sparkling water king. I would go through a case of sparkling water a week, if not more.

Everything started in January of 2024 when I changed insurance plans and started seeing a new dentist. My new dentist recommended I purchase a mouth guard to prevent my teeth from grinding at night. He also recommended I start using a fluoride mouthwash after brushing my teeth to help prevent tooth decay. Every night after that I would floss with mint coated floss, brush my teeth with mint toothpaste, and rinse with a mint fluoride mouthwash (Tom's Brand), then place my night guard in. I believe this is what ultimately caused my GERD (Obviously mint is a big trigger for me, but there's a little more to it so skip to the TL;DR for the quick explanation).

Sometime in February I began to notice some pain on ONLY the right side of my throat up through my jaw. I went to my Primary Care Physician and he looked in my throat and noticed some swelling and recommended a large dose of dexamethasone to try to clear it up. It didn't help, so he moved to antiobiotics. They didn't help either. By now it was March and I was desperate. Every day the right side of my throat/jaw was in immense pain and I was beginning to get ear pain as well. My PCP, to his credit, suggested it might be silent reflux (because I wasn't getting traditional heartburn symptoms) but by now I was convinced it was something more nefarious and begged for a referral to an ENT (I was convinced I had throat cancer or something). Up to that point I naively thought ""I've experienced heartburn before, and this is absolutely NOT heartburn, it hurts too much"". I was so mad at my PCP because I felt like I was being medically gaslit, so I turned down a script for Omeprazole and decided to tough it out till I saw a specialist.

Unfortunately my city and the surrounding areas has a two month wait to see an ENT, so I suffered for two months with this GERD pain. I considered going to the hospital several times, and came close at least twice, but my doctor was adamant that it wasn't throat cancer based on the symptoms so I decided I could wait 2 months rather than take on a huge and unnecessary medical bill. 

By this point I was beginning to suspect that the mouth guard had something to do with the throat pain. The mouth guard prevented my mouth from closing at night leading to dry mouth and a dry throat in the morning, so I stopped using it. My symptoms did improve slightly, but I continued using mint toothpaste and mint mouthwash at night.

I finally saw an ENT in May who diagnosed me with GERD and prescribed me a 90 day supply of Esomeprazole Magnesium 40 mg. I quit coffee cold turkey, quit eating spicy foods, and quit drinking sparkling water. It took longer than I expected, but around day 70 I was starting to finally feel pain free. After 90 days I transitioned to Pepcid AC for about a week before finally being mostly free from my GERD. As long as I avoided coffee, super spicy foods, and carbonated beverages, I could pretty much eat whatever I wanted. I even continued to use my mint mouthwash, floss, and toothpaste, but happened to randomly switch to doing that routine only in the morning.

Flash forward to March 2025 - I start seeing a new dentist (PS Dental insurance is stupid) and he tells me that brushing in the morning is not as important as brushing at night and also recommends I go back to using mouth wash at night to help prevent tooth decay. He recommends I try Therabreath Sparkle Mint Fluoride Mouthwash, so I do, and low and behold by May my GERD is back and I'm in an immense amount of pain. I call my PCP who sends in an order for Esomeprazole Magnesium 40mg, but after 30 days it hasn't even made a dent. At this point I'm in a full blown panic and I haven't connected the dots about mint. All I can think is that despite my diet consisting of traditionally non-triggering foods this is somehow happening again and it's worse even with a PPI. After scouring this subreddit I ask my doctor to switch PPIs for me and he puts me on 20mg of Pantoprazole. I also learn from this subreddit that mint is a major trigger so I stop using my mouthwash and switch to Bubble Gum toothpaste. Unfortunately nothing really changed for 30 days. I finally ask my doc to try a different PPI again, so he puts me on Omeprazole and that has been seeming to do the trick. I'm only 26 days into Omeprazole so I'm hopeful that after a full 90 day course I can come off of it again.

TL;DR: My hypothesis is that ultimately my mouth guard prevented my mouth from closing at night, leading to dry mouth and a dry throat. Then the mint mouthwash would settle into the mouth guard and crevices in my mouth and slowly trickle down my throat while laying down at night. The mint triggered my GERD and the acid came up at night and settled onto the right side of my BONE DRY throat because I sleep on my right side at night. I can confirm that Mint is a major trigger for me and Pantoprazole does not work for me as well as Omeprazole does.

Anyway, I hope this will help someone! Happy to answer any questions, and please stop using mint mouthwash and night guards!",1,1751775848.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

I'm 19 and a half now, and nicotine is a constant in my life. Consuming nicotine genuinely feels like a fourth sensation akin to hunger, thirst, or needing to use the bathroom. The longest I've gone without it was a month when I was 16, and it was the most agonizing month of my life. Even less strong vapes/ things like Juuls/Novos and Zyns put me into nicotine withdrawal, it seems. I may genuinely not have strong willpower, but it was utterly unbearable. I could sense that I was perhaps becoming happier towards the end of the month, but it was like Chinese water torture.  
I joke to my friends that I would need to be put in a medically induced coma to put it down.

I abuse alcohol, weed, and sex as well. I want to have genuine enjoyment in life, but I feel entirely unable to know where to start. My baseline has just been general unhappiness for as long as I can remember, from before I even vaped, and idk if I have the strength to leave it, but it feels like it acts as a metaphor for inaction in so many other aspects of my life. I am dependent on so many things to feel okay, maybe at my best. I want to feel better and see life as something to be enjoyed, not just lived. I don't want to be dependent on chemicals.

However, most stories that I have seen that are fantasy set in the modern era are either where it is just our world but with magic (either hidden or out in the open recently) or a world that technically isn't modern earth but basically is. Sure, the barista making coffee at not-Starbucks is an elf, but it doesn't feel like a fantasy world that has grown to this era but an urban fantasy setting that is in a different world so we don't have to say Starbucks, USA, Europe and the like. 

I am interested in the broad concept, so even if it doesn't match exactly but is in the general ballpark I'm fine with it.""Hard Magic"" by Larry Correia would be a good recommendation if I hadn't already read it, as even though it is explicitly our world that received magic it feels like a different world (for those who don't know, they received magic somewhere around 1860 and it has had a major impact on the entire world and is set somewhere around 1930). Other era equivalents would be interesting as well.",1,1751774897.0,Fantasy,5,0.6,False

I worked part time during high school, then worked two part time jobs last summer before leaving for school. I didn’t end up working during freshman year as I’m in engineering and wasn’t sure of the workload. However, I worked when I was home for breaks, and will be working part-time at school this coming year. I’m working full time this summer. 

I currently have about $8K saved, but am waiting on a few paychecks and will be at $11K by the end of the summer. I bought my own car back in high school, and have paid for all the maintenance and gas. It’s not been too cheap as I drive a 20 year old Saab, it’s about $1700-$2000 a year in repairs but still cheaper than a newer car. Ive tried to save by doing work myself, but that hasn’t really worked out for me. I drove a lot in high school as my parents are divorced and living 1 hour apart, so also spent a fortune on gas. I also occasionally buy groceries for my family when I’m home and help out with miscellaneous expenses maybe $100 a month. 
I’m not the most frugal, I’ve always had a bad coffee and fast food habit that I found out I was spending $150 a month on and am working on cutting back from. I was also losing money to subscriptions I never used, I’ve canceled those now. 

I’ve been paying $50 towards my student loans each month, which was $13K for my freshman year. Also paid for all my dorm furniture/supplies and move in expenses last year. A lot of that I’m reusing this year, I overestimated how much I needed. At the end of the summer I plan on paying off $7K, putting $2500 in a savings account and keeping the remaining $1500 in my checking. I’m hoping to pay off a good chunk of student loans each summer, as I’ll be getting into better paying internships. 

I also got my first credit card recently, and am paying for day to day expenses with it and paying it off monthly to build credit.

If you’ve seen my earlier posts, here’s an update: I (23M) finally went on that coffee date with the woman (38F) I met at a networking event about a month ago! We met up today, and I greeted her with a hug and asked how she was doing. Conversation started a bit slow but soon felt natural. We ended up chatting for about 90 minutes—she was engaged, maintained eye contact, played with her hair a little, and seemed present throughout.

It didn’t feel like a mentorship vibe (as some had guessed). She didn’t ask about my career or give advice. I asked most of the questions, and she seemed happy to talk and share.

I picked up the tab at the end—she thanked me without hesitation and didn’t offer to split it. As we left, I offered to walk her home, but she declined, saying it was in the opposite direction of the subway. I offered again but backed off when she insisted. We hugged goodbye, and that was it.

To be honest, I’m not sure how to read the date. She didn’t really flirt, and we didn’t make plans to meet again. I’m planning to text her tomorrow to say I had a great time and to suggest hanging out next weekend, but I’m unsure how to phrase it.

Because of the age gap, I’m only looking for something casual and plan to be upfront if things progress. Based on how things went, does it sound like she’s interested? Also, any ideas for a second casual but fun outing that won’t send mixed signals?

Bonus context: She was traveling internationally for work the past three weeks. Before she left, I told her I’d like to get to know her better and invited her for coffee.

This will be 25 years for my class, and apparently it's quite the milestone.  To my knowledge, they've held a reunion every 5 years since we got out, and I haven't been to any of them.  Honestly, I just don't care.

I didn't like high school, I don't look back on it with any nostalgia.  Oh sure, I loved my childhood, and I miss my brothers and me being together all the time, and lots of parts of being young, but school didn't factor into that.  I had school friends, but I haven't really seen or heard from any of them since we graduated.

Now, it's reunion season here in the American Midwest, and I have been invited via Facebook (which I almost never look at) and a proper mailed paper invitation when I didn't respond on FB.  Apart from getting added to a reunion group on FB for our 15 year, (and finding out in the group chat that I was dead) I haven't had anything to do with these people in 25 years.  But, my lack of response to the invites prompted a visit from one my old classmates, who is part of organizing the event, to my house this evening to touch base and see if I was going to attend. 

She got genuinely pissy when I said probably not.  She pointed out that it's on a Saturday afternoon, and that I only live a half hour from where they're having it, and they're doing a celebration of life for the guy who died last year (first one of our class to die).  This woman hasn't seen me or said a word to me in 25 years, I haven't made any effort to reach out to her, or anyone else.  Not out of hostility or anything, I just don't care.  I wish her well, I wish everyone well.  I hope all of them lead long and happy lives as we hit middle age, but I don't feel the need to go spend a few hours making small talk and pretending to care about people I haven't seen for a quarter of a century.

Maybe that makes me an asshole, I don't know.  Anyone else have former classmates make a big deal out of a reunion?

>I went to my 10th, mainly to see my best friend who was flying in from the other side of the country. It was pretty boring. It was mainly a way for people who already see each other every weekend to get together and see each other on a particular weekend, but with an audience.

>And my class was so lame, they forgot to do a 25th reunion (last year), so they threw something together last minute and scheduled it for Fourth of July weekend—you know, the weekend where people never have plans. 🙄.

**OOP**

>>There were 28 of us in my graduating class, and two of them were exchange students.  The people organizing this 25 year for mine are the 5 ""popular girls"" and they get together all the time anyway.  This is just a chance for them to, like you said, ""get together with an audience"" at a country club that they wouldn't go to otherwise.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xennials/s/f74ofE53wi)  **June 29, 2025**

Update on the class reunion.

It was last night, I didn't go.  This morning however I took my grandad to a late breakfast as I often do on Sundays.  

Uptown at the restaurant I was treated to the aftermath of said reunion.  The 5 ""popular girls"" who organized it were all there with their respective spouses/dates/whatevers, and were all clearly hungover.

Taylor (the one who drove out to my house to fuss about me not going) staggered up to us and told me how I missed a great time, and how it sucks that I'll have to wait 5 years for another chance to have such a good time with all my old classmates.

I told her it was my loss, but I was glad she and the others who came had fun and went back to my coffee.  She got pissy and said it was really hard for her and the others to put in so much work when so few people care, and if we don't start caring soon, then she and the others might stop caring and doing reunions and alumni events altogether.

Turns out, her and the other organizers and their significant others were the only ones that went. A total of 10 people, and 5 of them weren't even in our class.  The same 5 that have never left town, and hang out all the time anyway were the crowd. They realized they were the only ones going and decided in the couple weeks leading up to it to go meet with everyone who still lives in the area and see if they could convince them to come.  Evidently, it didn't work, and they were all having a ""poor little me"" brunch this morning up town after a night of heavy drinking at the local country club.  

I feel a little bit sad for them, honestly I think you all were right, some folks really do peak in high school, and never get past it.  The lecture from Taylor, and the stink eye I was getting from the others told me all I needed to know.  This was their chance to hold court and laud their accomplishments of yesteryear over all of us again, but no one cared enough to show up.

So Reddit, there's my ""I know why I haven't kept in contact with these people"" moment.  At least my grandad thought it was funny.  After Taylor walked away, he asked me if she was the slutty one.

>>It's not that it was good or bad, I just didn't care about it.  It was a hoop I had to jump through to get on to the rest of my life.  I didn't hate it, I didn't like it, I just didn't care.  I don't look back on that time with any fond memories or nostalgia, just as something I had to do.

>>I'd been with most of the people I graduated with since kindergarten.  I don't hate any of them, I hope they all lead long and happy lives at peace, I just have no interest in whatever they're doing in that life 25 years on.

**OOP on the cost**

>Cost was definitely an issue. It was $250 per person, so if I'd have gone and brought my wife, it would have been $500 to spend an evening with a group of people who I haven't had anything to do with in years.  It would have been even worse than that since nobody but them showed up.  I can spend half that amount for an upscale dinner in the city with my wife and avoid all the awkward socializing with people who peaked in high school.

I had to scroll through hundreds of Amazon reviews and Instagram comments. It's slow, tedious, and you always miss things.

AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude can't do this, they hit a wall on protected pages. So, I built a fully automated system using n8n that can.

This agent can:

* Scrape reviews for any Amazon product and give a summarised version or complete text of the reviews.
* Analyse the comments on Instagram post to gauge sentiment.
* Track pricing data, scrape regional news, and a lot more.

This system now tracks over 500,000 data points across amazon pages and social accounts for my company, and it helped us improve our messaging on ad pages and amazon listings.

**The stack:**

* **Agent:** Self-hosted n8n instance on Render (I literally found the easiest way to set this up, I have covered it in the video below)
* **Scraping:** Bright Data's Web Unlocker API, which handles proxies, and CAPTCHAs. I connected it via a Smithery MCP server, which makes it dead simple to use.
* **AI Brain:** OpenAI GPT-4o mini, to understand requests and summarize the scraped data.
* **Data Storage:** A free Supabase project to store all the outputs.

As I mentioned before, I'm a marketer (turned founder) so all of it is built without writing any code

* Setup a free account on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)

**Step 7: Connect the Supabase project to the workflow**

* Connect your Supabase project to the ai agent
* Back in Supabase **Table Editor**, create `scraping_data` with columns:
   * `id` (UUID, PK, default = `uuid_generate_v4()`)
   * `created_at` (timestamp, default = `now()`)
   * `output` (text)
* Map the **output** field from the AI agent into the `output` column.

**Step 8: Build further**

* **Webhook trigger:** Swap `On Chat Message` for `Webhook` to call the agent from any app or Lovable/Bolt front-end.
* **Cron jobs:** Add a **Schedule** node (e.g., daily at 05:00) to track prices, follower counts, or news.

❌Maurten: can’t do the drink mix, I need some sort of flavor, but I do enjoy their gels

❌GU: never tried their drink mix, but can’t stomach their gels

------------------------------------------------------------------

The concept of intermittent fasting has gained tremendous popularity over recent years, attracting attention for its potential benefits not just for weight loss but also for overall health. One of the questions that often arises in this context is whether intermittent fasting can actually slow down the aging process. To explore this, it’s essential to dive into the science behind fasting and its impact on longevity.

### The Biological Mechanisms Behind Aging

Aging is a complex process influenced by various factors, including genetics, environmental stressors, and lifestyle choices. As you age, your body's cells experience oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to cellular damage. This cellular decline is linked to diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer. Understanding how intermittent fasting interacts with these biological processes can shed light on its potential effects on aging.

### How Intermittent Fasting Works

Intermittent fasting is not about what you eat but when you eat. By restricting your eating window, you allow your body to enter a state of fasting, which can trigger several beneficial processes, including:

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
- **Autophagy:** This is the body's way of cleaning out damaged cells and regenerating newer, healthier cells. Studies suggest that fasting can enhance autophagy, promoting cellular rejuvenation.
- **Reduced Inflammation:** Fasting can lower markers of inflammation, reducing the risk of age-related diseases.
- **Insulin Sensitivity:** Improved insulin sensitivity can lead to better blood sugar control, reducing the risk of metabolic diseases.
- **Hormesis:** This is the process where exposure to mild stress, like fasting, makes the body stronger and more resilient.

### The Link Between Intermittent Fasting and Longevity

Research shows that intermittent fasting may indirectly slow aging by improving health markers associated with longevity. A study conducted on mice found that those who were subjected to caloric restriction lived significantly longer than those who weren't. While human studies are still in the preliminary stages, findings indicate potential correlations:

- **Improved Heart Health:** Intermittent fasting may help reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels, key factors for heart disease
- **Enhanced Cognitive Function:** Some studies point to fasting as a way to protect against neurodegenerative diseases, thereby prolonging the brain's health as you age.
- **Weight Management:** Successfully managing weight through intermittent fasting can decrease the likelihood of obesity-related health issues, which are often more prevalent in older adults.

### Caution and Personalization

While intermittent fasting shows promise in the context of slowing aging, it's important to approach it with a personal touch. What works for one person may not work for another. Factors such as age, health status, and lifestyle should determine whether this eating pattern suits you. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new diet plan.

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
Moreover, some people may experience negative side effects, including fatigue, irritability, or difficulty concentrating when they first start intermittent fasting. These symptoms often diminish over time as your body adapts to the new eating schedule.

### Practical Tips for Intermittent Fasting

If you're considering intermittent fasting to potentially slow aging, here are some practical tips:

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
- **Choose a Fasting Schedule:** Common schedules include the 16/8 method (fast for 16 hours and eat during an 8-hour window) or the 5:2 method (eat normally for five days and restrict calorie intake on two non-consecutive days).
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water, herbal teas, or black coffee to stay hydrated during fasting periods.
- **Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods:** When you eat, select whole, unprocessed foods rich in nutrients to maximize the health benefits.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how you feel during fasting. If you feel unwell, consider adjusting your fasting window.

While research is still evolving, the preliminary findings on intermittent fasting's potential to slow aging are promising. With its focus on health improvements over calorie restriction alone, this eating pattern may contribute to a longer, healthier life. As with any lifestyle change, consult your healthcare professional to find the best approach suited to your needs.

Lifestyle Changes to Enhance the Anti-Aging Effects of Intermittent Fasting
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intermittent fasting has gained popularity for its potential health benefits, including its role in slowing the aging process. But to maximize its anti-aging effects, you can incorporate several lifestyle changes that support overall health and well-being. These enhancements not only amplify the benefits of intermittent fasting but also help you maintain a youthful energy and resilience.

### Prioritize Nutrient-Dense Foods

During your eating windows, focus on foods that are rich in nutrients. This means prioritizing whole, unprocessed foods that provide vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. Here are some examples:

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
- Leafy greens: Spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are loaded with antioxidants.
- Berries: Blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries fight free radicals.
- Nuts and seeds: Almonds, walnuts, and chia seeds provide healthy fats.
- Whole grains: Brown rice, quinoa, and oats sustain energy levels.
- Lean proteins: Fish, chicken, legumes, and tofu contribute to muscle health.

By choosing these foods, you ensure that your body receives essential nutrients that can counteract aging at the cellular level.

### Stay Hydrated

Hydration is crucial in any diet, especially if you’re practicing intermittent fasting. Water plays a major role in a variety of bodily functions, including digestion, circulation, and temperature regulation. Aim to drink at least 8-10 glasses of water each day. You can also include herbal teas and broth. Staying hydrated helps maintain skin elasticity and overall vitality, enhancing the anti-aging effects.

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
### Incorporate Regular Exercise

Physical activity can significantly boost the benefits of intermittent fasting. Regular exercise helps in weight management, improves cardiovascular health, and enhances longevity. A balanced routine should include:

- **Aerobic activities:** Engaging in cardio like walking, running, or cycling keeps your heart healthy.
- **Strength training:** Resistance exercises help maintain muscle mass as you age.
- **Flexibility exercises:** Yoga or stretching can improve mobility and reduce stress.

Combining these elements can lead to enhanced metabolism and improve the anti-aging effects of intermittent fasting.

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
### Get Quality Sleep

Sleep is a significant factor in overall health and can impact how you age. Aim to get 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep is when your body repairs itself, and poor sleep can lead to increased levels of stress hormones, which may accelerate aging. To improve sleep quality:

- Establish a regular sleep schedule.
- Create a calming bedtime routine to signal your body it's time to wind down.
- Limit screen time before bed to enhance melatonin production.

Prioritizing sleep can enhance your body’s ability to absorb the benefits of intermittent fasting.

Check Home Doctor Here: https://easyfree.com.au/homedoctor  
  
### Manage Stress Effectively

Chronic stress can lead to premature aging by increasing inflammation within the body. To combat this, consider adopting stress-reducing practices:

- **Meditation:** Spending just a few minutes daily in meditation can bring about a sense of calm.
- **Deep breathing exercises:** These can help lower your heart rate and relieve stress.
- **Mindfulness:** Engaging in activities that require your full attention, like gardening or painting, can divert focus from stressors.

By actively managing stress and incorporating relaxation techniques into your routine, you enhance both your mental health and the anti-aging benefits associated with intermittent fasting.

Don’t overlook the importance of social connections. Maintaining healthy relationships can support emotional well-being and reduce feelings of loneliness and stress, both of which can contribute to aging. Make an effort to connect with friends and family regularly. Activities such as group workouts, cooking classes, or simply sharing meals can provide essential social support.

By integrating these lifestyle changes into your routine alongside intermittent fasting, you can bolster its anti-aging effects. Focus on nutrient-rich foods, hydration, exercise, quality sleep, stress management, and social connections. Embracing this holistic approach encourages not only a healthier lifestyle but also a more youthful you.

### Conclusion

Embracing intermittent fasting could be a powerful approach to potentially slow the aging process. The scientific evidence suggests that fasting may enhance cellular repair, reduce inflammation, and promote longevity. By stimulating autophagy, a process that eliminates damaged cells, intermittent fasting helps your body maintain its youthful resilience.

To maximize these anti-aging effects, consider integrating lifestyle changes alongside your fasting routine. Eating a balanced diet rich in antioxidants, healthy fats, and lean proteins during your eating windows can provide your body with necessary nutrients. Regular physical activity will complement your fasting efforts by boosting metabolism and enhancing overall well-being. Additionally, practicing stress management techniques, such as meditation or yoga, can further optimize your results, as chronic stress can impede health.

The journey towards slowing aging doesn't end with simply implementing intermittent fasting. It is essential to create a holistic lifestyle that fosters both physical and mental wellness. When you adopt these changes, you pave the way for a healthier, potentially longer life. So take the first step today—listen to your body, make mindful food choices, and embrace the transformative power of intermittent fasting. Your future self will thank you for it!

1lss3bv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lss3bv,Potato Defect in Coffee,"I recently read about the potato defect in James Hoffman’s World Atlas of Coffee book. Then shockingly I actually tasted it for the first time ever in my Rwandan coffee the next morning, which was wild!

I bought this Washed Rwandan coffee from a local roaster. I had a cup on batch so I knew what to expect. When I ground it to brew the next morning, I smelled a pungent grassy/earthy odor from the coffee grounds. After brewing, the coffee had a pungent odor/aroma—definitely funky, but not the good kinda funk.

Turns out, after researching a bit, coffee cherries in Rwanda and Burundi are susceptible to infection by a non-harmful bacteria that affects the flavor of the beans from those cherries. Typically it’s a small number of affected cherries, but even one bad coffee bean will blow the flavor of an entire cup of coffee.

It’s apparently called “potato defect” (PTD) bc people consider the flavor to be similar to the smell of raw potato while being peeled. “PTD” produces by far the weirdest flavor I’ve ever tasted in coffee. I’ve had some funky stuff from some anaerobic process coffees, but this was different. This was “Stinky raw potato” — not a flavor note you want your pour over to hit 🤣

The bacteria that produces the smelly toxin is actually a side effect of the coffee plants being attacked by antestia bugs (akin to Stinkbugs). But the odd thing is this is only known to affect coffees in several neighboring East African countries. It seems the only real way to catch this issue is at the farm level before any processing occurs to the cherries. After the beans have been processed, the defect is virtually undetectable until after the bean has been roasted and then ground, which means the coffee roaster is unlikely to know there’s any issue—it likely will not be discovered until the end customer grinds or (sadly) brews the coffee.

There’s a lot of research about PTD (potato taste defect) — this was my first time learning about it, but it’s a much discussed issue in the coffee world!

Discussion:
-What has been your experience with PTD?
-Do you have a story to tell about the first time you encountered PTD in your morning brew?",5,1751774390.0,JamesHoffmann,1,1.0,False
1lss34a,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1lss34a/hiring_animator_for_youtube_shorts_recurring_work/,[HIRING] Animator for YouTube Shorts (Recurring Work – Cartoon Rig + Aviation Comedy),"Hi! I’m building a series of vertical YouTube Shorts combining airline absurdity, sarcastic storytelling, and cartoon realism — all from the POV of a fictional airline captain.

I’m looking for a creative, reliable human animator  (not AI or prompt-based tools like Veo3) to work long-term on this series.

✈️ What I Need:

1. Build a reusable airline captain rig** — white male, late 30s, dark blonde hair, green eyes, clean airline captain uniform (4-bar epaulets). Must include:

   * Lip sync
   * Blinking
   * Eye movement
   * Basic hand gestures
   * Ability to hold and animate props (e.g., smartphone for vlog framing)
   * Consistency in design across every short

2. **Animate ongoing 30–60 sec vertical Shorts** — always aviation-related. Settings vary: cockpit, terminals, jumpseat, crew lounge, simulator. Character must look and behave the same across all episodes.

 🎨 Style:

* **2D rig-based animation preferred** (Moho Pro, AE Duik, Toon Boom Harmony, etc.)
* Clean cartoon style — Pixar-meets-satire
* Strong focus on **subtle expressions + comedic timing**
* 3D proposals will be considered only if stylistically consistent and lightweight enough for rapid production
* Consistency is key — this character is the face of the channel

 💬 Voice & Script:

* Real VO will be provided (recorded, not AI-generated)
* Scripts and visual direction provided for each episode
* Delivered in vertical format (.mp4 or .mov, 9:16 ratio)

---

 🧪 **Test Script Sample**: ""The Lav Ghost (a.k.a. Why I Don’t Fly Redeyes)""

> “Okay, it’s 2am. I got to the plane early. But listen… There’s tapping on the windshield. No maintenance logged. No ground crew listed. It’s just me.”
>
> *Ghostly hand drags across the glass. Lav door creaks open.*
>
> “Cool cool cool. I definitely locked that.”
>
> “There’s no one onboard. Ops hasn’t sent fuelers yet. And I swear to god I just heard a flush.”
>
> *Cockpit lights flicker. A faint whisper. Coffee cup tips on its own.*
>
> “Great. A haunted lav. Again.”
>
> “If this ghost wants jumpseat privileges, he better list properly like everyone else. FAA’s pretty strict about... living pilots.”
>
> *Camera glitches. Captain sighs, defeated.*
>
> “Captain’s Log: If I disappear mid-leg, tell dispatch it was Lav Charlie. Again.”

 ✏️ To Apply:

* 2–3 rig-based animation samples (no AI, no Veo3, no prompt-based tools)
* State which animation software you use
* Confirm availability for ongoing work (1–2 shorts per week)
* Pricing: 1) for character rig, and 2) per short after rig is built
* Bonus if you offer caption/subtitle styling

---

📌 **This is recurring work.** We're building a long-running animated series with a consistent character and animator relationship.

🕐 Start: ASAP — with one rig + 1–2 paid test shorts.

1lsrzy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1lsrzy7/ginawa_pala_akong_trophy_gf_hindi_partner/,"Ginawa pala akong trophy GF, hindi partner.","Problem/Goal: First post ko ‘to, and to be honest, hindi ko alam kung saan magsisimula.

I’m 25, still figuring out this whole love thing, just like every girl who was in their first tome falling in love. Never had a label before him. I’m not the type na mabilis ma-fall, pero when I do, I fall hard. I knew it naman. He was the perfect example.

So this guy, (M27) came along, kala ko finally, may lalaking papasok sa mundo ko without trying to rearrange it.

We met at an indie film screening. We talked about Wong Kar-Wai, and he said he liked that I wasn’t like “other girls” or whatever that means. I laughed. He asked if I wanted coffee. After that night, sunod-sunod na. Dinners, long drives, deep talks (akala ko). Then one night, he held my hand and said:

“You’re the kind of girl I want to bring home. You’re not just pretty, I think, you’re presentable.”

That should’ve been the first red flag. But I just smiled. Kasi for me, it felt like being chosen.

After that, he started posting me. Stories, selfies, sweet captions. People in the comments would say “power couple!” or “goals!” And I felt proud but not because of the posts, because I thought he was proud of me.

Pero slowly, napansin ko something weird.

He never took photos of me when it was just us. Only when we were out. Only when there were people around to see.

At first I brushed it off. Baka visual learner lang siya. Maybe he likes it private.

Pero kahit isang candid photo habang natutulog ako sa car? Wala. Kahit isang stolen moment? Wala rin

One time I tried to kiss him while we were watching a movie. He gently pulled away and said, “Don’t mess up your lipstick, ang ganda mo ngayon.”

That’s when it hit me.

He didn’t love me. He loved the idea of me. The curated version and the one that made sense in his feed. Yung tao na paano ba, looked perfect on his arm? Nevermind the version of me who cried after a hard day, or the one in the house na nakapambahay.

Then came the twist I wasn’t ready for.

I found out through a tagged photo that he brought someone else to a wedding. Not a family member.

Another girl with a different look at different yung vibe. Very Instagrammable.

I confronted him, shaking, but calm. You know what he said?

“Hindi kita sinama kasi alam kong hindi mo type ‘yung crowd. Tsaka ayokong may ma-feel ka na out of place.”

Out of place? Sa buhay niya? Or sa aesthetics niya?

Then he said this words that ick me, and it’s been ringing in my ears ever since:

“You’ll always be my 10/10. But sometimes, hindi naman laging 10 ang kailangan i-present, diba?”

That broke something in me.

I wasn’t his partner. I was his presentation. A FUCKING PRESENTATION. Pang-header image. Pang-flex sa barkada. Pero never pang front sa totoong buhay niya.

Now I’m here. Heartbroken, humiliated.

I’m not even sure why I’m writing this. Maybe to warn others. Maybe to remind myself that being loved beautifully is different from being loved completely.

So if you’re reading this, and something feels off in your relationship, don’t wait for the screenshot, or the tagged photo

Magtatanong sana ako kung dapat ko pa ba siyang kausapin, pero sa totoo lang, pagod na rin akong magmukhang highlight reel sa buhay ng taong never nag-effort panoorin ang buong pelikula ko.

Might update.I guess we’ll see kung marinig pa niya ‘yung katahimikan ko.

Caleb didn’t remember falling asleep.

One moment he was on the couch, the pine box across the room, the soft burn of tobacco smoke still lingering in the air. The next—he was walking through a forest, quiet and clean, mist curling at his feet like silk.

But this wasn’t the wild forest from his nightmares.

This place was **gentle**. Luminous.

The pines stood tall but calm, their needles dusted with dew that glimmered like starlight. The air smelled like moss and cedarwood. Everything was slow. Patient.

In the clearing ahead, someone sat at a weathered picnic table. A chipped mug of coffee steamed beside him.

**Jonas.**

He looked like Caleb remembered him on the day they met—his jacket too big, his hair too messy, that kind of confidence that was half real, half armor. His smile came easy. Always had.

“Hey, forest boy,” Jonas said softly, grinning.

Caleb let out a small laugh and sat across from him. “Hey.”

Jonas didn’t tease. Didn’t accuse. Just looked at him with warmth in his eyes.

“You look tired,” he said.

“I feel… pulled in two directions.”

“That’s because you are,” Jonas said, leaning forward. “One part of you wants to keep hiding. The other part? It’s waking up.”

Caleb looked down at his wrist—the Mark glowing faintly beneath his skin.

“I didn’t ask for this.”

“No one asks to carry something heavy,” Jonas said. “But you—you’re not alone. You’re *never* alone.”

Caleb’s throat tightened. “Sometimes I still feel like I am.”

Jonas reached across the table and took his hand. Warm, solid. Familiar.

“You found love once, Caleb. You’ll find it again. You’re made of the stuff.”

The trees stirred around them—not threatening. Curious.

Jonas gave a small nod toward the forest beyond.

“They’re watching. Not to trap you. To see what you’ll become.”

Caleb squeezed his hand. “I miss you.”

“I know,” Jonas whispered. “But missing isn’t the same as being broken. And you are **not** broken.”

The forest brightened for a moment, like the sun had found its way through the canopy.

Then, the voice came.

Not Jonas’s. Not human.

Something deeper. From the trees themselves.

“Keeper of the Codex.Return what was taken.Or learn what it means to be followed forever.”

The forest began to twist again. The trees leaned inward. The dream grew darker—but Caleb wasn’t afraid.

He looked at Jonas one last time.

And Jonas smiled. “Wake up. You’ve got work to do.”





Caleb sat up on the couch, heart steady but racing. Morning light filtered through the curtains. Ivy meowed gently from across the room, no longer hiding. She approached him, curling beside his foot like nothing had happened.

The pine box was where he left it—but it felt… quieter.

Not safe. But not screaming.

He stood and walked to the window.

Outside, the neighborhood was still asleep. The street glistened with early dew.

And on the windowsill, someone—or something—had left a pine bough.

Fresh. Green. Peaceful.





That afternoon, Caleb drove to Discovery Park. Somewhere with space, and trees, and sky that didn’t press down on you.

He sat on a hill overlooking the water. A breeze carried the scent of salt and pine together, like the two halves of something old finally meeting.

Families passed by. Couples. A few queer folks, too—young, laughing, bright. Caleb watched them. Not with envy. But hope.

He breathed deep.

And for the first time since taking the book, he felt a flicker of something else.

Not fear.

But **clarity**.





That night, the dream came again—but Jonas was gone.

In his place stood a figure in the distance.

Tall. Covered in moss and fur and moonlight.

The Watcher.

But this time, it didn’t threaten. It **waited.**

And Caleb stood his ground.

Nah, I didn't grow up with her. She used to be toxic and I really resented her before. We were not closed until I've had my little family and she voluntarily took care of my baby while me and my hubby work. 

Years passed, our relationship improved. I saw how she changed. From being toxic and selfish into an understanding person. She now listens to learn and trying her best to unlearn her negative traits and point of views. Dati puro nega at hinala ang lumalabas sa bibig nya, ngayon marunong na syang magbigay ng benefit of the doubt. Kung dati ang hilig nya mag invalidate ng feelings, ngayon tumatahimik muna sya to process things before giving her opinion. 

Yes, may character development si mother! Teachable na sya ngayon unlike before kala nya sya laging tama. Marunong na din sya mag reflect at mag sorry pag alam nyang mali ang ginawa at sinabi nya. 

Through the years, she slowly opened up to me how her childhood was, how her parents and siblings treated her, how abusive my father was that's why she broke up with him, how she found comfort and love with my step-father, and lastly, how she regretted leaving me to my grandparents and being an absent mom for years.

So who am I to stay bitter? She deserves to be forgiven. She tried her best makabawi and most of all, she's trying her best to improve and be the better version of herself while she still have time to do so.

1lsru3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramas/comments/1lsru3w/i_have_tried_to_finish_our_unwritten_seoul_but_i/,"I have tried to finish  ""Our Unwritten Seoul"" but I realized it just isn't for me - and that is ok","To avoid any misunderstandings, I write this post not as a knock on the series, but for a personal sense of closure and to share my experience with the first kdrama I've ever kept up with while it is airing. I am just gonna ramble a bit in an effort to move on. Yes, it's silly but I need to put this somewhere. 

As some may be aware, Our Unwritten Seoul is a drama I kept up with every week and wrote impressions on each episode up until ep 10. I initially took it on as a challenge to watch something weekly and try to keep up with it, while also trying something that I just usually don't enjoy, that being a more romantic drama.

I had certainly enjoyed writing my reviews, challenging myself, but at the 10 episode mark I simply couldn't anymore, as I really wasn't enjoying the actual process of watching the drama. I felt that I had misunderstood the direction it will go in and expected something out of it that it would realistically never approach, that being a more serious mature slice of life.

I am glad I watched it so I can develop my own taste and know what I do and don't like but I really did not engage with it to the extent I've seen others. Nobody is wrong for liking it and I do not wish to invalidate anyone else's opinion.

I am really glad I wrote all of the impressions I did on each episode as a measure to improve my own writing. 

Before sitting down to write this, I was hoping to sit down and finish the last 3 episodes, but having had time to sit on the drama and watch a few other shows I'd been meaning to, namely ""Blind"" and ""Children of Nobody"" (and currently ""Nobody Knows"") I feel that my taste in what I do and do not like is developing and I found it really difficult to sit through the more cutesy, lighter tone of this show. Even for the more, on paper, serious stuff, it feels much less serious than what I personally enjoy.

I cannot in good faith critique the overall show as I haven't finished it, hence why this is **not a review,** so I will not. I will just say that I perhaps expected a much grimmer 2nd half then was ever going to be the case, and so I was disappointed by my own expectation. I tried to sit down and watch Episode 10 but around 10 minutes in I just had to turn it off as I just was not enjoying it. 

That's not to say there aren't things I liked, I still really like Han Se Ji's character as he felt the most grounded, but as for the rest...I'm sorry, I realized something while thinking back on what I had watched; and that is that the entire tone of the show just doesn't match up to my preferred tone for such a setting. As it stands, again, for what I've watched, it sits somewhere between being fuzzy and light and being very dour and heavy. It went to some dark places in the first few episodes but even then it just didn't feel as serious as I would personally prefer for a vast majority of the 2nd half. 

To make a silly coffee analogy - I enjoy my coffee bitter black with no sugar. It has a refined but strong taste, the bitterness reflecting life itself. Anything but that strong taste feels too weak in comparison. OUS feels like it contains precisely 1/4 of this that I require for such a story and setting, while also having precisely a teaspoon of sugar added, and for many others whom like their coffee like such, that is perfectly fine. For many whom aren't cynical bastards like me, the darker stuff may hit harder, but my caffeine tolerance is too high at this point in my life. 

I like my adult stories with adult casts to have characters whom are fully grounded and have a certain weight to them and their words and have a lot of bittersweet reflections that I just didn't feel from OUS. Shows like My Mister, Our Blues, WLGYT, Navillera and Mother come to mind, with My Liberation Notes, Dear My Friends, Misaeng and Work Later, Drink Now hopefully joining them soon. 

Some dialogue in the show was great (mostly with Han Se Ji), I liked many scenes, but I just couldn't continue with it, and that is fine, I know more about myself and what I do and do not like now and am ready to move on. Conclusion being that it just isn't for me - and that is completely fine. I am more aware of my own tastes now, am more certain as to what I dislike about romance as a genre and am glad that I challenged myself to go out of my comfort zone. 

Sorry about the ramble, I know many others enjoyed the show and I don't want to take it away from them, it isn't a bad show.

Anyway, enjoy your sunday. ",6,1751773475.0,kdramas,2,0.69,False
1lsrtz8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lsrtz8,"Two $9.99 prepared foods bags and two $6.99 bakery bags from Whole Foods in Newport News, Virginia","The total I actually paid including tax was $36.80. The items are...

* Greek-style grilled lemon chicken with orzo, etc. ($9.99)
* Chile Verde chicken soup ($8.99)
* Classic chicken salad ($6.62, $12.99/lb) 
* Field greens & goat cheese salad ($8.99)
* T.T.L.A. sandwich (which I believe stands for tempeh, tomato, lettuce and avocado) ($9.99)
* Another field greens and goat cheese salad ($8.99)
* Penne Alla Vodka with hot Italian sausage ($10.99)
* Snack tray with cheese, crackers, grapes and a brownie ($6.99)

* 6 sesame seed bagels ($5.99)
* 4 more blueberry muffins ($7.49)
* 4 more chocolate chip muffins ($7.49)
* 6 more peanut butter cookies ($6.49)

By my math that totals up to a pre-tax retail value $140.45. Sell-by dates seemed to all be today from what I could see, and everything looks to be in good condition. The only faults I could find were that the exposed edges of the avocado slices in the T.T,L.A. sandwich looked a bit oxidized (it's an avocado, it happens) and a few of the peanut butter cookies were a bit broken, although it's possible that was from them getting jostled around on the way home. They're going to taste the same anyway, and I might even break up one or two of them even further into smaller bits to crumble into some vanilla ice cream or something.

Went ahead and froze the pasta and the Greek chicken immediately, and I'll eat the salads, sandwich, snack tray and maybe soup over the next few days. I'll probably keep a few baked goods out to have with my morning coffee and then freeze the rest.

Not too shabby a haul overall.

I was slowly hesitant at first, she was a little younger than me (which I avoid normally), we met while I was out at a queer event right at the end of June, swapped info, and she reached out to me online.

I was very hesitant, and let her initiate, but goodness did she come on strong. I wouldn't say it was love bombing, but she showered me with compliments and attention. I made it clear I was comfortable with that and enjoyed the attention, and asked if she would like me to return the same. She said as long as I was honest, and so I did, I gave honestly flattery and matched her level of enthusiasm and attention. For about a week we talked at this level and it was too the point I felt ridiculously enthusiastic for the date, I was, dare I even imagine it, thinking maybe we would kiss. She even introduced me to a bunch of her friends.

The night before, I was trying to pick an outfit while talking to her and mentioned I felt like an idiot standing in my underwear looking at a ton of clothes on the ground when she met me in the grungiest shit imaginable and she still asked me out. She asked to see, so I sent her a picture of the clothes all over the ground, then she ""lol""ed and said ""No, of you."" I ask if she means my underwear and she said ""Yeah!"" with an emoji grin. I don't feel any shame for my body, I'm actually proud of it, so I send a picture. She gushes so hard and wow, I can't help but think about that possibility of a kiss.

We had agreed to coffee, and we also agreed that if we didn't have any red flags, we would do something after and made follow up plans. After all the talking I had trouble imagining we would stumble into red flags in a coffee date, but we both discussed and agreed it was still a good idea.

We meet, and we start talking, I try to pick up where we last left off from our conversation online, gushing about a show she convinced me to watch (The Silo), when she stops me.

I don't think I could recite exactly what she said but the key points were that she felt I came on too strong, and she felt manipulated into emotions and rushed in the relationship. She felt that I was a danger because I couldn't control myself and she felt I had sexually violated her when I sent her a sexy picture. She called me predatory, and said if I was going to assault people at least I should stick to guys (I'm bi but like... there was one guy back in highschool I know I liked).

She then said she had already blocked me on everything and asked her friends to do the same and left.

I grabbed a big can of beer and went home. I'm sipping it wondering what the fuck I did wrong here, and trying not to let the idea that I'm a predator cement itself in my mind because it was my biggest fear in learning to approach people and flirt.

The US border was created to protect White property. 

Latinos are native Americans by ancestry, and did not arrive here by boat 200 years ago. North and south America are arguably a single continent and unarguably were indigenous here for thousands of years before European arrival. 

Spanish, English, Portuguese are European languages, not American languages. We are being nice by speaking their languages for them.

European descendants are the actual immigrants to this land. European American corporations have been illegally and unethically extracting resources, land, and labor from this continent (among others) without care to local ecosystems and populations. They make laws that make themselves richer and hurt even their own people nevermind people of majority (dont call us minorities, don't call us people of color). 

Make no mistake that ICE and the border patrol are tools of genocide and the rebranding of Latinos as ""illegal"" on their own land  is part of that narrative. 

It is imperative that Latinos/Hispanics take back their narrative on their own ancestral land. Tamales and tortillas are native American foods.  Corn, beans, coconuts, tomatoes, coffee, chocolate, all of these are native American foods and they didn't go away, neither did we. The titiri dance is native, as is the grito in tejano music.

Latinos must not give into the concept they are immigrants, they are NOT. 

THE TRUTH IS, we do have an immigration problem however, and its past time the tables turn to the proper direction.

Bacon, cheese, cream in coffee — sounded kinda fun, kinda extreme.  
I thought: “Cool, I’ll just eat fat and lose weight?”

**Spoiler alert:** That’s not how it works.  
And honestly, that mindset almost made me quit before I even started.

# 🤯 The Misconception: “Just Eat Fat and You’ll Burn Fat”

I fell into the trap.  
Loaded my plate with fatty meats, heavy cream, and cheese.  
Zero veggies, no real planning, no idea what macros were.

Guess what happened?  
I felt bloated. Sluggish. Gained weight in week 1.  
*And* I blamed keto.

But it wasn’t keto’s fault — it was mine.  
Because **keto isn’t about overeating fat. It’s about balance** — and using fat as a tool, not a crutch.

# 🧠 The Mindset Shift That Changed Everything:

I finally read the science. I followed a plan. I tracked what I ate (even just roughly).  
And this is what I learned:

>

Once I got the structure down, my cravings dropped, my energy went up, and… the scale finally moved.

# 🥑 What I Eat Now on a Balanced Keto Day:

**Breakfast:**

* 2 eggs scrambled in ghee
* Sautéed spinach
* ½ avocado
* Black coffee with 1 tsp MCT oil

**Lunch:**

* Grilled chicken thighs
* Roasted broccoli + zucchini
* Olive oil drizzle

**Dinner:**

* Cauliflower rice stir fry with paneer or tofu
* Coconut milk curry base
* Topped with coriander, lemon juice

**Snacks:**

* Boiled eggs, cucumber slices, cheese cubes, or a handful of almonds

And LOTS of water with pink salt.

I've been interested in penpalling ever since I was a kid. The vastness of regional differences that history and media introduced me to swept me away, making me endlessly fascinated in what many things this world seemed to have out there to be discovered and experienced. That was back in the days before you could more easily meet someone from halfway across the world sooner than a neighbor a few doors down. Since then, I've been fortunate enough to have met people to exchange with, and I'd like to see if I can find that again.

I'm looking for someone that I first and foremost have a connection with. My ideal is to actually get to know my penpal. Location doesn't matter as much, as who that person is defines whether I'd like to engage with them or not. I do have a preference for cultural exchange, in which we can be introduced to different and new things. But, whether you're in my state or half the world away, it's you, the person, I want to exchange with.

Ideally, I'd like to have a physical exchange, with my preference being letters and items. Due to the private nature of penpalling, however, I'd like us to actually chat a bit and get to know each other before diving right into those physical aspects of it. Let's become familiar with each other to make sure we're a good fit. That being said, I'm increasingly interested in having e-mail penpals, which I'd be more open to in the immediate now. It's more than possible for one form to transition into another or for us to have multiple forms of penpalling going on at the same time, so let's start with what works best for us.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you?

I'm 34, male, and live in the US (Michigan). Thoroughly introverted, with a deep desire to engage with those who can tap into that aspect of me. My personality is designed for the slow burn and deliberation of written conversation. I'm potentially interested in many things with the right people and in the right environments, but left to my own devices, I always come back to the same core things.

*I strive to engage in genuine and thoughtful discussion.* Cognitive vibes are key for me. I do best with abstract minds that peak with ideation and whimsy, but don't think I'm so limited. Compatibility is a strange thing that feels most real when it's too fluid to be defined. We're compilations of potential that spark and enhance through engagement.

*Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine.* I'm an autodidact who's been passionate about a variety of pursuits since I've been young. I'm most infatuated with the nature and function of reality, and particularly human perception. I deem nothing to be above reproach, but also that a lack or limitation is highly limiting. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.

*Creativity and artistry are important to me.* Personally, I write; about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also adore writing conversationally, from mundane chats to lengthy letters, often permeated with a dim poetic glow. Photography also has a hold on me, and I hope to do more than just dabble in it.

*I like burning incense, time pieces, archiving and organization, collecting, and coffee.* I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted.",1,1751771858.0,penpalsover40,0,1.0,False

Of note, I took shared transport to the resort and some folks got out at a much more upscale resort than mine and the smell upon opening the van door was gag-inducing. Don’t assume the high end resorts can do anything special about the sargassum. The reason I didn’t bother to switch resorts on my first day to CPM is because the sargassum is everywhere and I would not have been able to enjoy the beach there had I transferred. 

Resort Grounds
Layout felt more resort-like than CPM, sort of reminded me of a Club Med from the 90’s. Very well manicured. Constant upkeep. A lot out in the sun. The wildlife was different - lots of agoutis and no coatis that I saw, which might be preferable for some guests who are unnerved by those smart little badger-cat-raccoon creatures. Agoutis are like cat-sized capybaras and are cute as hell. Also saw big iguanas here, and the grackles are bold. 

This resort is the same as Catalonia Yucatán Beach (CYB). Same grounds, no real delineation, you can walk among both. If you’re price comparing and wondering about amenities, they are the same between CRM and CYB. Just pick the one you get the better deal on.

I noticed that there were ramps everywhere I saw stairs, even if they were tucked around a corner. At least one building has elevators serving higher rooms. Paths are smooth and wide and well maintained. If you use a mobility assistive device you’ll probably get around well at this resort. This is in contrast with CPM which was definitely not optimized for anyone on wheels. 

Food
Bless everybody’s hearts, but the food here is appalling. I thought the food offerings at CPM were mediocre, but at least they had a large buffet and the food options were diverse with plentiful fruit and fish/seafood options. There are two buffets here at CRM and they are both a quarter of the size of CPM’s buffet, and empty at every meal which tells me people are leaving to eat elsewhere and/or going to the speciality restaurants for dinner. But I have simple tastes and a small appetite, and figured I would try and make it work. 

Some more details if it is helpful:
One of their buffets - the one closer to CYB - is indoors. The other one is essentially outdoors and it hot and uncomfortable; I did not trust the things that were supposed to be cold. Of course the indoor one is not open for lunch at the hottest part of the day. One area where CRM was better than CPM: non-alcoholic beverage options. Actual aguas frescas were available at the buffet at every meal, serve yourself. The desserts are the same as CPM: everything gelatinized, lots of puddings. The breads are the same as CPM. 

I ate at Ayami, the Teppanyaki place, for dinner one night. If you are used to a Teppanyaki experience… don’t go here. My chef was brand new, which the waiter told us, and at the end of the meal, he apologized. Literally apologized for the experience. Sigh. It wasn’t so bad that it merited an apology, but it was the most sullen and unenthusiastic Teppanyaki chef I have ever had. I hope she’s ok, like with her life. All meats and veg cooked on the grill were bland/unseasoned and overcooked. The sushi appetizer was bizarre (banana on top?) and the fish quantity so small that I understood that fish was just not on the menu in any meaningful way at this resort. 

From other vacationers, I was warned away from the other restaurants. Considering Ayami is widely considered the best, I took this advice. 

There is a snack bar in the daytime in the place where the steak restaurant is at night. They serve lunch food. Beach hot dogs (note: specifically labeled non-pork for those who need this!) and fries, tacos, “pizza,” small salad bar. Since the lunch buffet proved inedible for my first two days, I ate here the second two and it was not exactly good or what I was hoping for on my vacation but at least I wasn’t hungry. There is a crepe stand on the CYB side, not as good as CPM’s crepe spot. No fresh fruit for the crepes other than bananas; toppings were thin fruit syrups. Also there are no milkshakes there - the sign is out of date. The food truck is a little square box serving grilled cheeses. Didn’t look appetizing to me but lots of kids were lined up and munching happily. No coffeeshop like CPM, which I patronized daily for iced coffee and better pastries. 

Accommodations
I arrived and was told my Premium Single room wasn’t available, so they were upgrading me to a Premium Suite. Sounded good! I got one of these upgrades once when I went to CPM and it was a dream. Here it was a nightmare. The room was literally located next to reception, the arrivals driveway with huge buses idling, the evening bar, and the theater. I couldn’t use my balcony because it was not private, I couldn’t even open my curtains because every person checking in could look straight into my room. My first evening when I should have been relaxing, my room was literally shaking from Karaoke next door, and I could hear every vehicle idling. I went to reception and requested a room change… I could have literally raised my voice and asked from my balcony but I did walk over. The front desk initially balked at my request, but eventually agreed to move me the next day, which meant checking out at 11am the next morning and back in at 3pm for the new room. 

The new room was in the 4000 block and it was so much better. More private, more quiet. Less renovated? Sure. Smaller? Also yes. It was honestly kind of shabby. But I was happier there for the rest of my trip, and able to enjoy reading on my balcony without feeling like I was in a fishbowl. 

A note to those wishing to upgrade their lodging even beyond the premium suite fishbowl: I walked past the very premium and ultra premium accommodations. They are laid out like little townhouses along one edge of the property. They were not private at all, and along a strip where tons of drunk people stumble back to their rooms at all hours; the balconies overlook the main path. Maybe they’re nice inside, but they are not going to offer the luxury of peace and quiet. Be forewarned. 

Spa
I was pleasantly surprised by the spa, given the rest of the resort. This was an objectively nice spa. I had the “luxury” treatment which was two hours and cost $230 USD. For what I got, it was very worth it - a one hour massage, 45 minute facial, and 15 minute scrub.  My therapist was Ana and I would recommend her. The atmosphere is peaceful, temperature controlled, and felt luxurious. I have not gone to the spa at CPM, so can’t compare. 

Guests
Being careful here and sticking to the facts as I observed them: the clientele at this resort was different than CPM. The majority of guests were British, and their behavior shocked me. So, so many drunk Brits, in a constant state of being overserved. I witnessed more bad guest behavior here than at CPM by a mile: truly falling-down drunks, screaming, picking fights with one another, vomiting in bushes, abusive behavior towards staff. I’m sure there were other folks drinking a bit too much in the sun, but one can literally hear the language and accent in which they’re speaking/screaming. 

I saw plenty of security but they walked right by these folks, which tells me this behavior is tolerated at this resort. 

Families with children were mostly non English speaking. 

Entertainment
I don’t partake of the entertainment at resorts, but I definitely walked by a very enthusiastic daytime pool show that was Mexico-Canada friendship themed and the evening shows are in an indoor temperature controlled theater rather than the outdoor amphitheater at CPM. There was a live cover band one night at the bar and while it’s kind of funny to hear a singer singing hits phonetically in English, the musicians were legit and had some talent.

Excursions
I don’t partake of the excursions, but the desks to schedule excursions were easy to find around the corner from reception, and unobtrusive. There was a vacation club outpost by the pool staffed with their concierges, if that’s your thing. 

Overall
I won’t be back. This resort was notably worse than Catalonia Playa Maroma in almost every way. ",2,1751771854.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

I was wondering if I should get the xm6 or the AirPods Max based solely on ANC efficiency. 
I don't really care about the price right now since the AirPods are on sale and are the same price as the xm6.
For context, I need to block voice sounds like in a busy coffee shop for example. I also heard some people recommending using earplugs with anc headphones to block the most sound as possible. 
Will that interfere with the xm6 in ear ANC mic? Also, I wear glasses.

If you’ve seen my posts here is an update: I (23M) finally went on that coffee date with the woman (38F) I met at a networking event a little over a month ago! We met up today, and I greeted her with a hug and asked how she was doing. The conversation started off a little slow, but it gradually became more relaxed and natural. We ended up chatting for about an hour and a half. She seemed engaged, maintained good eye contact, played with her hair a bit, and stayed present throughout the conversation.

It didn’t feel like a mentorship vibe like some thought it may be, she didn’t ask about my career or give advice. I asked questions, and she seemed happy to talk and share

I picked up the tab at the end, and she thanked me without hesitation and didn’t insist on paying herself. When we left the coffee shop, I offered to walk her home, but she declined, saying she lived nearby and it would be the opposite direction of the subway for me. I offered again just in case, but backed off when she insisted. We hugged goodbye, and that was it.

Now to be honest I’m not sure how to read the date. She didn’t really flirt, and we didn’t make plans to meet again. I’m planning to text her tomorrow to say I had a great time and to suggest doing something together next weekend but don’t know how to phrase it. 

Because of the age gap, I’m only looking for something casual and not a serious relationship. If things progress, I plan to be upfront about that. My question is, based on how the date went, does it sound like she’s interested? And does anyone have ideas for a second casual but fun outing that won’t send mixed signals?

Also, I’d really appreciate advice on what exactly to text her tomorrow—especially since I want to suggest hanging out again without coming on too strong.

Additional context: The reason we hadn’t met sooner is that she was traveling internationally for work for three weeks. Before she left, I told her “I’d really like to get to know her better” and invited her for coffee. She actually offered to meet the next day, but I wasn’t available. While she was away, we messaged every few days and she shared updates about her trip.

For three years, I was forced to s3rve men day and night. Countless men left my room with their pants still undone. I wasn't even allowed underw3ar, losting all control over my own body. The smell of shame clung to me. 
When my brother finally came to get me, my legs had been brutally broken. They probably expected tears and pleading. But now I was pale, hollow and sick. I knelt numbly and my voice shook as I begged, ""I'm sorry I was wrong... I'll never dare again... Please...""
My brother looked completely panicked. He rippied off his shirt and draped it over me, screaming hysterically, ""Who did this to you?! I'll kill them! I'll slaughter their whole damn family!""
With a faint smile, I weakly raised a trembling hand... and pointed straight at him.
……………………
1.Chapter 1 Three Years' Punishment
""I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""
""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.
Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.
She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.
Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.
What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.
He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.
This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.
Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.
Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""
The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.
""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?
""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""
When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""
The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""
But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.
Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.
When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.
She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.
'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'
But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.
She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.
Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.
They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.
But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.
Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.
""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.
He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'
The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.
He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'
Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""
But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""
""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""
His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""
Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.
In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.
If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.
Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.
The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.
She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.
Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.
Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.
Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.
They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""
Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.
Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.
But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.
Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.
Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.
Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""
No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.
The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.
In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.
But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.
A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.
Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""
Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.
Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""
2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?
Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.
Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.
Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.
If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.
What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.
Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""
Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.
Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.
But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""
""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.
Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.
Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.
Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.
No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.
""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.
But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.
Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""
Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""
Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.
Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.
Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.
""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""
The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.
She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""
Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.
Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'
""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.
That was when someone finally lost patience.
""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""
Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.
""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!
""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""
Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.
Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'
Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""
""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.
""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""
Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.
""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.
When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""
Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.
Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.
He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.
When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.
But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.
Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.
The air between them turned stiff with silence.
Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""
Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.
After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""
""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.
Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.
She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.
But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.
3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes
Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""
Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""
Athena nodded quietly.
Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.
Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.
She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.
""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""
Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.
But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.
She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.
""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""
The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.
As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.
The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""
The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.
Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""
Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.
One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.
""I'm Siena Hotham.""
""I'm Aliza Crofton.""
Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""
Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.
Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""
Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.
The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""
Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.
The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.
The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.
She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.
Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""
Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""
Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""
Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.
This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.
The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.
Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.
Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.
Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.
After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.
""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.
Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.
Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""
Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.
There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.
Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.
Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.
Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.
If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.
After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.
But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.
""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.
Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.
In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.
She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.
""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""
Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.
When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.
She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.
He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""
The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.
At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'
But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.
She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.
Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'
4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame
Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.
""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""
""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.
He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""
Athena almost laughed out loud.
She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""
That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""
Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.
A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.
His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'
Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""
Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.
Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.
""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""
That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.
""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""
Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.
The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…
She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""
Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.
Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.
Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""
She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.
Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.
Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.
She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'
But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.
Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""
Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.
Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""
Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""
Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""
Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""
She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.
But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'
Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""
Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""
Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""
Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""
She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""
Nicolas stared at her in silence.
She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.
His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.
""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.
""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""
She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.
Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""
Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""
Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""
Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.
And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.
But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.
5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There
Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.
His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""
Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""
After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""
Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""
That one phrase froze the air in the room.
Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""
A hint of anger crept into his expression.
Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""
Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.
""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.
He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""
Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""
Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.
Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""
She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.
Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.
Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.
She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'
Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.
Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.
The room fell dead silent.
Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""
Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""
Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""
When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.
Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.
Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.
She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.
When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.
But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.
Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.
Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.
He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""
Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.
""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.
""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.
Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.
She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""
Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.
""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.
Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""
After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.
She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""
Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.
Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""
Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.
Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.
""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""
She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.
""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""
She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.
She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.
Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.
Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.
Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.
Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.
'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'
""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.
Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""
She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.
Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.
She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness… I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'
6.Chapter 6 Replace Her
The next day, Athena was summoned to Margaret's courtyard.
When she arrived, Willow was already there, kneeling obediently beside Margaret, gently massaging her legs.
The moment Athena walked in, Willow scrambled to her feet in a panic. She greeted her timidly, ""Athena,"" then quickly stepped aside to give up her spot, looking every bit the picture of meekness and quiet suffering.
Nicolas frowned, clearly displeased. His voice was low and stern. ""Willow, you're also raised under this roof. You don't need to act so pitiful in front of her.""
Then he shot Athena a sharp look, his eyes full of disdain. ""No one in this house owes you anything. Who are you putting on that sour face for every day?""
Eloise gave a light cough into her handkerchief. ""Nicolas, that's enough.""
Nicolas glanced at her, then held his tongue—but his expression remained cold, and his eyes, harsh.
Athena understood then—he was speaking up for Eloise. He must have heard that she'd turned Eloise away the night before.
She looked over at Eloise, who wore a stiff, embarrassed expression.
Eloise seemed to want to say something, but when her eyes met Athena's icy gaze, she lost her nerve and backed off. Annoyed, she turned and snapped at Nicolas, ""Go check if your grandmother's medicine is ready.""
He knew perfectly well she was trying to send him away—and truthfully, he had no desire to face Athena's cold stare any longer. With a flick of his sleeve, he stormed out.
""Such a temper,"" Margaret muttered once he was gone, then beckoned to Athena. ""Athena, come here. Sit with Grandmother.""
Athena came forward and sat beside her. Margaret took her hand, her voice warm and affectionate. ""You've had a hard time.""
Athena placed her hand gently over hers. ""As long as I have you, Grandmother, it hasn't been so hard.""
Margaret let out a long sigh, then got to the point. ""Athena, there's something I want to ask you.""
""Of course, Grandmother. Please speak.""
""Do you still care for Michael? Is he really the only one for you?"" There was hesitation in her eyes, and a deep, pained concern in her expression.
Ever since Athena returned to the estate, the Osborne family had sent someone—very discreetly—to suggest replacing her in the engagement.
Not wanting Athena to be humiliated, Margaret had sent them away under a pretense.
Athena understood immediately. ""They want to call off the engagement?""
She had spent three long years locked away in a military camp—her reputation utterly ruined. Of course the Osborne family would no longer want a disgraced woman as a daughter-in-law.
Margaret nodded, clearly struggling to say it aloud. ""It's not quite breaking it off… They just want to marry someone else instead.""
Athena's eyes shifted to Willow, who quickly looked away, guilt written all over her face as she lowered her head.
It all made sense now.
Her reputation was in tatters. If the Osborne family officially broke the engagement, it would offend the Monson family and create bad blood.
But they didn't want her anymore. Swapping her for Willow—pure, innocent Willow—would be the perfect compromise. And more importantly, Willow was willing.
Everyone in the room was focused on protecting the duke's estate's reputation—yet not one of them had asked Athena what she wanted.
No wonder their expressions had all been so tense. They were afraid she'd cause a scene. Too bad for them—she wouldn't give them that satisfaction.
""Grandmother, I agree,"" Athena said, her face blank, her tone as calm as if she were commenting on the weather. ""I agree to the change in engagement.""
Margaret and Eloise stared at her, stunned.
""But you were once so in love with Michael. What made you change so suddenly?"" Margaret asked, clearly baffled.
Athena had once cared for Michael so deeply she would've laid down her life for him. That was the only reason Margaret had bothered to ask her in the first place.
But Athena's expression didn't waver. ""That was a long time ago, Grandmother. People change. I stopped caring about him ages ago.""
At that, Eloise let out a visible sigh of relief. She turned to Willow and gave her a knowing, tender smile.
Willow clung to her arm, eyes lowered, face tinged with shy delight.
The quiet exchange between the two made the whole situation feel even more absurd to Athena. The decision had clearly already been made—so she wondered, 'Why the charade of asking me?'
Margaret looked at Athena with deep sorrow in her eyes. ""Athena, don't be afraid. Even if the Osborne family backs out, I'll do everything I can to find you a good match.""
But she knew in her heart—Michael had been the best they could hope for.
With Athena's name in tatters, there was no way they could arrange a match of equal status now. No noble family would consider her. Her life, as far as society was concerned, was over.
Margaret felt a stab of grief—her precious Athena had endured too much.
But Athena just smiled faintly, as if it no longer mattered. ""All I want is to stay by your side, Grandmother.""
""Don't be silly."" Margaret sighed. ""You can't spend your whole life looking after me.""
She hated to see Athena wronged, but this was the best outcome left. If the Osborne family officially ended the engagement, Athena's reputation would be in complete ruin.
Before long, Margaret grew tired. After helping her settle in for a nap, Athena quietly stepped outside.
As she walked out, she handed a folded slip of paper to Marquita Huynh. ""From now on, prepare Grandmother's medicine using this prescription.""
Marquita looked surprised. ""Lady Athena, where did this come from?""
""A friend gave it to me. If you're unsure, feel free to have a doctor look it over."" Athena didn't elaborate. She handed over the prescription and walked away.
Just as she stepped through the gate, she stopped abruptly—Michael was standing right in front",1,1751771468.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1lsr73v,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1lsr73v/could_this_be_adhd_or_something_else_just_want/,Could this be ADHD or something else? Just want the truth.,"Hi everyone. I’m not looking for a diagnosis here — I know that can only come from a professional — but I’m hoping for some clarity and maybe advice from people who’ve been through this.

Growing up, I was always told I was just a “difficult” kid. I’ve always been very impulsive, very blunt, very emotional, and socially a little “weird.” I’d get angry quickly, cry easily, and feel overwhelmed. I’ve always had a hard time regulating my emotions — and it still happens now.

But I never really thought about ADHD, because I could pay attention in class (at least on the surface), and my mom never pressured me about grades. She didn’t care if I got a D or an A — she just wanted me to pass and enjoy being a kid. So nobody really noticed anything was “wrong.”

There’s also something about my school history that might matter:
When I was in Grade 1, I was already 9 years old because I had a terminal illness before that and couldn’t start school on time. On top of that, I wasn’t really “smart” enough to pass the first grade at the usual age. Because of my older age, I got away with a lot — teachers didn’t really push me, and classmates didn’t notice much either. Eventually I took an exam to accelerate me into the “right” grade for my age, and that’s when I really started struggling.

By then, I realized I had no real study habits. I’d never learned to take notes properly or study from books. In fact, through all of high school I barely ever opened a book — I just listened in class, wrote things in my own words, and managed to scrape by.

Now I wonder: maybe I was just undisciplined. Maybe I was just lazy or stupid. Maybe I got away with too much early on, and now I’m paying for it. Or maybe there’s an underlying problem — ADHD, anxiety, something — that explains why I feel so stuck.

Here are the things I still struggle with:
— Forgetting things constantly and misplacing stuff.
— Making silly mistakes, even in math, which I actually love and am good at conceptually.
— Hyper-focusing on things I find interesting but shutting down on boring tasks.
— Terrible working memory — I forget steps, signs, instructions easily.
— Feeling “useless” without a calculator even though I understand the concepts.
— Sensitivity to noise, textures, and crowds — I get irritated fast.
— Horrible handwriting, bad spelling, emotions all over the place.
— I feel ashamed a lot because I do try — but I still fail in areas where I don’t feel interested.

And here’s something I’ve noticed that I’m not sure if it’s related:
Whenever I drink coffee, it’s a hit or miss — sometimes it makes me anxious and jittery, and other times it just makes me sleepy. I don’t know if that’s a sign of anything or not, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

What I really want is closure. I want to know if this is really just me being lazy or undisciplined, or if there’s something deeper — ADHD, anxiety, whatever — going on. My mom and sister have even said they think I might have ADHD, but I’ve always brushed it off because I didn’t think I fit the stereotype.

I guess my question is:

Does it seem worth it to get evaluated?

Lite ice, we only fill the cup up halfway with ice. In our coffee drinks, the rest gets filled with milk, same with teas. If you get a lite ice rebel, it will not be filled up to the top completely unless you want to buy another rebel can. No ice means you want the same amount of liquid that is in a normal drink filled completely with ice. Since we fill the cup full of ice, this averages out to be about half. Cold pour, which will be extra in costs, is zero ice and filled completely to the top. The price depends on size and the drink you are getting.

I’ll be in Toronto from **July 6 to 20**, working remotely weekdays **11:30 AM to 7:30 PM**—but my evenings (and weekends) are wide open. I’m hoping to meet people who are curious about actually doing things in the city, even if it’s just a relaxed coffee in a park to start.

A bit about me:

I’ve been living in **Victoria** for 3 years now. Before that, **10 years in the Philippines** and **17 in Saudi.**

So far, my **2025** has been about:

* learning how to sail (spent 5 days aboard in the West Coast Gulf Islands),
* getting better with motorcycles (I had a highside fall - front flipped and rolled. Don't worry I already passed my MST weeks ago)
* climbing (scars on my arms)
* laughing with friends while playing poker, big2, or mahjong. And deepening my bonds with them.
* playing the piano
* learning French (hoping to get my A1 level this year; want to be part of my Duolingo fam membership?)
* watching films, playing video games (hey Clair Obscur or TeamFight Tactics fans)
* running and hitting the gym.

I'm for moments that start small but stick around. Friends say I might be an **ENFJ**, but I think I’m still figuring out the letters.

I’ve got a few ideas lined up for the time I'm here

* Checking out **climbing gyms** (Rock Oasis, Joe Rockhead’s)
* **Off-road moto tours** (Off Road With Us Toronto)
* TIFF Lightbox films like *Life of Chuck* – I’m staying super close to this place
* Short runs, long bike rides, quiet parks
* Romeo & Juliet at the High Park Amphitheatre (July 13)
* Summer blockbusters (*HTTYD*, *Materialists*, *Mission Impossible*, etc.)
* Chill evenings with a drink or two, maybe good jazz or a rooftop bar

But honestly… we don’t need a grand plan. Just someone to share the city with—however that shapes up. So if any part of this makes you pause (in a good way), reach out. Let’s meet, talk, wander, climb, or sit in stillness for a bit.

Whatever makes sense.",2,1751771115.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,0,0.75,False

I discovered mold in my DeLonghi Dinamica espresso machine (automatic bean-to-cup), and I’ve been deep-cleaning it for over an hour now. Unfortunately, I keep finding more gunk and I can’t fully take it apart.

Would you just replace the machine or try to get it professionally cleaned?

Personally, I’m leaning toward replacing it. I don’t mess with mold. It gives me the ick and this feels like a health hazard at this point. (To be clear, this is my fault. I went on vacation and forgot to empty the basket. RIP.)

So:

🫘 Looking for a new automatic espresso machine (not pod-based, I want to use my own beans)

🫘 I’d love something that grinds and brews with minimal daily effort

🫘 Not trying to drop $6k, but I’m okay investing in something decent that’ll last 3 to 5 years like my last one

🫘 Not into Nespresso (but if you’re a diehard and want to convert me, fine, I’ll listen)

Mainly need it to be an espresso machine, would prefer automatic. 

If you’ve bought a machine you love or know where to shop for one locally (Seattle WA), please send recs. I’ve heard of Seattle Coffee Gear, anyone been?

1lsr2yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ALS/comments/1lsr2yi/should_i_tell_my_dad_he_is_being_taken_advantage/,Should I tell my dad he is being taken advantage of?,"
My dad was diagnosed with ALS last year, and he immediately started searching for anything that might help. Recently, he found out about a place called Body Science in Miami, FL. Since then, he has sold his home and his truck to pay for their treatment. He says it’s worth it because they claim a 70% success rate in reversing ALS. I supported his decision. This is his journey, and I can’t imagine what he’s going through. It sounded like a chance at hope with impressive claims.

I visited him yesterday, and he told me about his second 3-week visit to Miami. I asked if he was seeing any positive results, and he said he has actually gotten worse. He can no longer breathe on his own when lying down. With this disease, just as you begin to come to terms with one devastating reality, another hits right after. My dad is still walking by himself and gets up early in the morning on his own to make coffee that is prepped for him the night before. 

After hearing more about what Body Science is doing, it all sounds like fake medicine. I’m not a doctor, but it feels like snake oil. They’re doing things like injecting him with some dye RFK Jr. talks about, running his blood through UV light, claiming to “open toxin pathways” due to supposedly sky-high heavy metal levels, and treating him for Lyme disease. It seems like they say the same things to every patient. At first, I thought it might be experimental drug therapy, but it’s mostly just supplements and pseudoscience. Now they’re blaming him for not improving because he isn’t “avoiding toxins” well enough.

These treatments are three weeks at a time. I can’t help but feel that this time would be better spent with family. We all help care for him, and I’m about to spend a week as his primary caregiver so we will have a lot of time together to talk. I feel so conflicted. I want to tell him how I really feel, that these people are taking advantage of his desperation, and that he should be spending this time with loved ones. But I also don’t want to take away his hope if hope is fueling him, just something to take his mind off of it all? And part of me wonders, what’s the point now? The time is gone. The damage is done. My new reality is that any day my dad could fall when no one is watching and I could lose him.

1lsqxda,https://www.reddit.com/r/crumblcrew/comments/1lsqxda/i_genuinely_think_nobody_at_crumbl_corporate_has/,i genuinely think nobody at crumbl corporate has worked here a day in their lives,"ive been here a month and a half now and i understand why people quit within a week of working here. i work at a small, lesser known location that's kind of out of the way. during the mornings it's chill (relevant later), but at night, we get slammed.

because we haven't been meeting our efficiency quota, a lot of hours have been cut, so we don't have enough hands on deck to deal with everything: balling dough and packaging frostings & glazes & misc things, mixing things from the game plan and as we need them, decorating cakes and cookies, panning out cookies to be baked, and someone fulfilling orders. usually there's only one person fulfilling orders, and another employee occasionally stepping in to help out.

i think one of the worst parts about working here is the ridiculous 2-minute time limit rule. there were three employees at my location today, including me. there had to be one guy balling the molten lava cookie at all times so that we wouldn't have to wait for it to freeze again and the closers wouldn't have to stay longer, the other guy mixing, decorating, and panning, and then me who is stuck at the order station for minutes on end dealing with the rush. something that especially annoys me is when customers who ordered online or doordashers say that they're here when they're not actually, so you just wasted time doing an order to meet the time limit when you could've been doing an order for someone who was actually there. it's especially bad when there's multiple six packs and four packs of big cookies that need to be dressed. i usually manage to get everything out before the time limit, but even then, it's stressful. i feel bad for the guy who had to make up for the morning shift's shortcomings to support me, too.

another thing i hate is that all of the customers are staring at you while they wait for their cookies. there's no room to express any sort of frustration like there might be at a different food service job because you are being scrutinized. not to mention the pressure to make every cookie perfect, customers who don't even thank you, don't tip during a rush, and ones who expect you to tend to their every need when there's obviously multiple people waiting on their order. and god forbid you don't say ""for deez nuts"" or ""for benson goon"" to some middle or high schooler who thinks you're an npc.

the open concept doesn't make crumbl more welcoming, it makes it more awkward. they can all see you when you are at your most stressed and i hate it. even coffee shops, where most of the employees are somewhat visible but still hidden by a counter, get more privacy than us.

i think if someone from corporate actually worked at a busy crumbl location for once that they would realize how abysmal the 2-minute time limit is when you're short-staffed, and that the open concept is generally unpleasant. maybe my store in particular is stressful because the management sucks and most of the employees started around the same time because of the high turnover rate, but does anyone else feel this way?",14,1751770318.0,crumblcrew,5,1.0,False
1lsqx9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW_PH/comments/1lsqx9e/meet_me_at_cafe_talisay/,Meet me at Cafe Talisay,"It was rainy afternoon when we agreed to have a late lunch at Cafe Talisay. The place was just 15 mins walk from my apartment but guess what you arrived ahead of me. I forgot my glasses and didnt notice that you were seated right across the room not until you called my name. 


We were wearing a matching black long sleeves paired with jeans and when you smiled you made my heart literally jump 10 feet off my chest and for some weird reason it felt like 1st date all over again. We ordered hefty food you paid all of it reason being kasi sabi mo ""para may next time"". That's my queue that you really like my company. And what made the night even more interesting when you asked me ""is it okay if I will bring you home?"" Girl, humaba ung hair nagloop sa QC circle coz 1st time someone asked me that question I wanted to hear. Hindi imposed ung paghahatid, but rather may respectkais may consent. Too bad we didnt had pictures that night. 


We had few more dates and some special night. The first time I saw you I know I really want you, not just as a friend but more than that. How we clicked and laugh. Or how our values are aligned and the importance of family in our lives. And I can imagine waking up with you making your breakfast and coffee. At times that we will be working from home, I will do the cooking and you will do the dishes and we'll have those long drives on weekends. 


But some things are not meant to be, as much as I do like you I know I wasnt ready to take what we have a notch higher. Things started to crumble one day and I tried to hold it off but it fell flat on thd ground. I was hurt but i know I hurt you more unknowingly. But of the flipside i am still thankful that we are still friends to date  and seeing your picture beside her part of me was saying it should've been me but I blew my chances. I saved our pics and what I love the most is when you were hugging from the back and we were both smiling. Kapag nakita nila un the usual comment ""grabe bagay na bagay kayo"". 


So maybe some stories are meant to be that way, the happy ending means we gained a friend but lost the possible love of our life. Sakit di ba? And i know I aint alone with this dilemma.

I only started to get into preworkouts because of the opportunity to use stimulants to get that boost (high caffeine, all the other stuff). 

Yes, there is some psychological boost in these stimulants but it can be hit or miss, depending on the day the same stimulant can cause you to wander off into some imagination land in the middle of a workout or on the flip side it could give you some kind of superman motivation to get the job done. 

But BARE KNUCLE by APOLLON is the first preworkout I’ve ever used that actually gave me so much energy in the form of strength (if it makes sense). I just kept going and going and I could’ve  worked out for hours and hours. 

Next time I try it I’ll aim to defeat my PRs and let you know how it goes. But in terms of endurance I had so much energy that the volume of the weights lifted should = more gains alone. 

Damn, I didn’t know a preworkout could do that. I got distracted by the allure of stimulants, that “high”. But I find it now to be kind of overrated. 

I think a black coffee brewed to perfection + a non stimulant workout like this is probably what preworkouts were originally designed for and i only just stumbled upon this. 

Oh yeah and the PUMPS, now I understand why people talk about the pumps.

1lsqwpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransLater/comments/1lsqwpm/i_chickened_out_of_something_super_mundane_yet_not/,I chickened out of something super mundane.. yet not,"Okay well I'm out to my parents, i'm out to my extended family members (i hate facebook but its where they all are), i'm out to LINKEDIN for petes sake, haven't had any issues, and today I was going to go down to the birthday party of my neighbor across the hall.  Our apartment building has a weirdly active social life, people in our building get together for pizza parties and coffee socials and L--- had her 80th birthday today and I was going to go down and say hi.. and I just couldn't do it. I felt weird about it. It would be the first time I'd seen most of them since my transition. And these are a bunch of old people that I barely know. Its not like my cousins or some old coworkers that know me.  These are like.. normies, boomers that I've chitchatted with about fishing and yard sales. 

What's weird is a few of them have seen me around the building in girl mode and haven't recognized me. Either they didn't recognize me or didn't say anything. perhaps I am the topic of building gossip. I have no idea.

This is why i was nervous. My parents, i know them. they love me, they accept me unconditionally.  I'm lucky to have them.  These building neighbors are a wild card.  Maybe one of them is a huge transphobe! Maybe they all are. I have no idea. they never had any trouble with my husband and I as a gay couple, so they'd probably be okay with us as a ""het"" couple... maybe!??!  It was that uncertainty that gave me pause. and the fact that I didn't want to blow in and take over this poor woman's birthday party with my own coming-out scene. 

The fact is that I don't really mind at the end of the day what my neighbors think of me, BUT they are in a unique position to make my life difficult if they really do decide i'm a sicko or whatever.  So I kept away when I kind of wanted to go say hello. Maybe I'll just go knock on L's door one day and tell her directly.

I can't drive (partially because of the anxiety but also because of a disability in my hand that makes gripping the wheel for more than a few minutes painful) so I never have the chance to go anywhere. I’m 29 and I have never grocery shopped alone, gone to the gym alone, nothing. The closest I have ever been to really being alone is when my mother would drop my off at work and then pick me up after (which felt identical to when I was at school).

I work from home editing now so I leave the house even less than I used to but I've decided I really need to try to leave the house more often. My therapist even mentioned maybe finding ways to work outside the house. So, I’m shit scared, but I'm gonna do it. Tomorrow, I’m gonna spend time alone. In public. 

I bought a messenger bag for my computer and my mother is going to drop me off at a coffee shop about 15 minutes from home and I will be there for a few hours working. I’m terrified. I keep telling myself it's a good thing. That I'll get a coffee, a sweet treat, plug in my headphones and be all set. That everything will be okay and anyone who is in there will be concerned with themselves and not with me. But then my brain starts firing off. 

""What if someone steals my computer? What if someone steals my bag? What if people stare at me? What if I get hurt? What if that is the time someone decides to rob the store? What if I run into someone I have bad history with and there is no one there to cover for me? What if family I’ve cut out of my life comes in? What if I get super sick while I'm there and have to go to the bathroom? Do I take the computer with me or risk it getting taken? What if I spill coffee on my computer?"" 

And on and on and on. 

I’m gonna be 30 in the fall. I want to be more independent, I want to be more confident and do more things on my own so I can eventually feel comfortable enough to be independent. How do I get over this deep anxiety of being alone in public? Not just at the coffee shop but at the gym, at the store, anywhere. I want to be confident but the idea of being a woman alone in public with no back up and no escape scares the hell out of me. Any tips to make me feel even slightly less anxious and insecure would mean the world to me. ",2,1751769797.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

I'm feeling a bit silly because although I am very aware of my extreme caffeine intolerance, I decided to get a black tea latte today. I've actually had it before and hadn't had any issues and I can usually tolerate caffeinated tea better than actual coffee, but a couple of hours after drinking it, I had a fun little digestive emergency (and by fun I of course mean I got stomach cramps so bad I started sweating and immediately had to run to the bathroom where I proceeded to spackle the bowl for about thirty minutes). I'm assuming it was the combination of caffeine, sugar, and whole milk, although I was worried it might be food poisoning because it was a bit more severe than it usually is. However, there was no vomiting/fever and I started to feel relatively okay after going to the bathroom a few times. Could it have been food poisoning despite no other symptoms? Or does it sound more like an intolerance issue? Anyone else extremely sensitive to caffeine to the point of liquid diarrhea or is that just a me problem?

I’m sure I’ll still get roasted in the comments, but here goes…

I discovered mold in my DeLonghi Dinamica espresso machine (automatic bean-to-cup), and I’ve been deep-cleaning it for over an hour now. Unfortunately, I keep finding more gunk and I can’t fully take it apart.

Would you just replace the machine or try to get it professionally cleaned?

Personally, I’m leaning toward replacing it. I don’t mess with mold. It gives me the ick and this feels like a health hazard at this point.
(To be clear, this is my fault. I went on vacation and forgot to empty the basket. RIP.)

So:
	•Looking for a new automatic espresso machine (not pod-based, I want to use my own beans)
	•I’d love something that grinds and brews with minimal daily effort
	•Not trying to drop $3k, but I’m okay investing in something decent that’ll last 3 to 5 years like my last one
	•Not into Nespresso (but if you’re a diehard and want to convert me, fine, I’ll listen)

Mainly need it to be an espresso machine. 

If you’ve bought a machine you love or know where to shop for one locally, please send recs.
I’ve heard of Seattle Coffee Gear, anyone been?

Thanks in advance from one tired, caffeine-deprived local.

Since we were fry, I occasionally met his then GF, now his ex and became friends with her too. We used to chill together a lot. And I was good friends with both of them like if the guy was out of town, me and his ex would make plans to go out etc. I always thought they would end up together and was so happy for them. I met them when their relationship had turned 5 year.

A couple of years later the guy had to move out of town and I guess long distance did not work out. The guy started doubting her if she is cheating on him with a colleague (which she did not) and they ended up breaking up on the phone. I usually give them as much space as possible but this time things were getting ugly. Me being close to both of them brought them to a place together to talk as my last try to make this work but both ended up putting their points to me rather than talk with each other and ended up breaking up after 7 years of relationship.

A few months post this COVID hit and I went back home to stay with my parents and support them. The guy still kept in touch with me but the girl slowly drifted away. They eventually ended marrying other people a few years later. Note: I am only touch with the guy, so I am also an acquaintance to his now wife and daughter. 

I had visited the guy’s place last week and we planned to catch up for drinks. While drinking, he opened up to me saying him and his ex have now been talking for 6 months and they have been texting intimate stuff with each other. He also told me that they are planning to meet. At first I thought it’s okay coz meeting his ex is fine you know over a coffee or something. But then he told me they are going away for a weekend.

Now I am not sure what to do. I tried telling him it’s wrong but he isn’t backing off. Should I confront his wife and tell him this or should I completely stay away from all of this. But my heart aches coz it’s unfair to his wife and daughter.",4,1751769050.0,Marriage,5,0.83,False
