I am furnishing a flat with oak wooden floors and have decided on the STOCKHOLM 20253-seat sofa, Sundhamn beige. The walls are white and the living room is roughly 4 x 4 meters.

However, I am struggling to style the rest of the living room (rug, coffee table and armchairs). Would anyone be able to help?

1p78m05,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2025/11/trump-inflation-affordability-policies/685054/,Trump Doesn’t Understand Inflation,"#Having promised to lower living costs, the president seems keen to make American life more expensive.

By James Surowiecki, The Atlantic. 

Americans are very unhappy with Donald Trump, and they’re very unhappy with him for one reason in particular: the cost of living. On the campaign trail last year, Trump promised voters who were upset about inflation that, if elected, he would slash energy and electricity costs and “rapidly drive prices down and make America affordable again.” He has not succeeded. The cost of living has risen since he took office (inflation today is at 3 percent, up from 2.9 percent in 2024), and Americans are now as angry at him as they were at Joe Biden. In a CBS News/YouGov poll released over the weekend, 64 percent of those surveyed disapproved of Trump’s handling of the economy, and 68 percent disapproved of his handling of inflation.

Trump’s reflexive response has been to lie. “We don’t have any inflation,” he insisted earlier this month. Also: “Our prices are coming down very substantially on groceries and things.” But because the president can’t quite convince people that they are paying less for beef or electricity than they are actually paying, he has had to come up with some policies to deal with inflation. Unfortunately his plans are little more than quick-fix gimmicks that—in the unlikely event they are ever enacted—promise to make things worse.

One of Trump’s challenges in dealing with inflation is that his signature policy—raising tariffs on imports from almost every country in the world—has made the stuff Americans buy more expensive, not less. Trump could, of course, just repeal the tariffs (he did finally lower the duties he imposed on coffee, beef, bananas, and other food imports). But Trump really loves tariffs. So instead of getting rid of them, he has suggested simply sending Americans $2,000 “dividend” checks paid from tariff revenues.


A problem with this plan is that there are no dividends to pay out: sending $2,000 checks to most American households would demand more than what the government has collected in tariff revenues so far. In other words, what Trump is proposing is dumping hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit-funded stimulus spending into the economy. That would fuel inflation, not help quash it.

Trump’s taken a similarly shortsighted approach to health insurance. The impending expiration of many Affordable Care Act subsidies at the end of the year means that lots of Americans face a massive spike in their health-insurance costs. That has focused the public’s attention on the outrageous cost of health care more generally. Figuring out how to make insurance affordable for healthy young people while also guaranteeing reasonable insurance prices for older Americans and people with preexisting conditions is an incredibly complicated problem. Trump doesn’t do complicated. His solution is to simply repeal the ACA and just give people money so they can “negotiate and buy their own, much better, insurance.”

Send money directly back to the people may sound good, but it is hard to see how this plan would help a 55-year-old man with diabetes secure affordable insurance. Instead, it seems like a great way to freeze out a lot of people from the health-insurance market entirely.",1,1764166024.0,atlanticdiscussions,0,1.0,False

We were in our weekly sync at the office (I have another fully remote job), and my manager cracked a joke that I was probably 'taking the scenic route' on project deliverables.

That's when I realized I hadn't said that in my head. My heart was pounding against my ribs.

The look on my manager's face was... Not happy, to say the least. But honestly, his so-called 'jokes' are just a way to belittle people in front of everyone. When we took a quick coffee break afterward, a few of my teammates came up to me and said it was a bold move. I wasn't trying to be a hero, but hearing them say that honestly made me feel a little proud. I'm tired of people using ""it's just a joke"" as a shield to be disrespectful.

1p78l9r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p78l9r,Amy’s Diary — Tuesday (After School),"“More Trends After Mud Queen Episode 8?!?!”

Tuesday after school turned out to be way funnier than I expected.

Me, Penny, Kira, Winfrey, Carmen, Siu Ling and Monique were all sitting at our usual table at the park when Penny suddenly yelled:

“GUYSSSS! LOOK! There’s ANOTHER new trend after The Adventures of the Mud Queen!”

We all froze.

Because after Episode 8, the whole world was reenacting the “mud splash scene,” and honestly… we thought NOTHING could get sillier than that.

But nope.

Penny opened her phone and showed us a whole bunch of videos—
grown-up influencers doing “The Coffee Queen Challenge.”
(Thankfully, ALL the people in the videos were clearly adults.)

In the videos, adults tried to imitate the villainess from Episode 8 — the one who dramatically spilled a drink on herself while laughing like a diva.
Except now… everyone online turned it into a joke.

One girl poured fake coffee on her T-shirt and went:

“POWER OF THE BEANS, AWAKEN!”

Another influencer in a pool bar shouted:

“I AM THE LATTE QUEEN!”

We nearly died laughing.

Even Kira fell over the bench.

Winfrey wiped tears from her eyes and said:

“Why are adults like this? First Mud Queen… now COFFEE Queen?! What’s next? TEA Queen?”

Carmen answered:

“Don’t give the internet ideas.”

And then Monique added very seriously:

“Actually, the next villain in the show IS called ‘Lady Earl Grey.’ So yes.”

We exploded again.

Amy’s Thoughts

I love how the internet keeps turning The Adventures of the Mud Queen into these weird trends.
But the best part is sharing them with my friends.
Every time someone posts something ridiculous, I know exactly who I want to show first.

And honestly…

I kinda want to see if the Coffee Day staff would react to this.
Zoe would definitely roll her eyes.
Haruka would take notes for “research.”
And Mr. Tanaka would politely pretend he didn't see anything.

What a day.

The intention by the administrators is that **OMSCS should always be done part-time** so that you could explore things that you love and enjoy. Do not rush to graduate! Take time off, do something that you really like in the meantime, and come back stronger.

**So what if the current job market is thrashy?** Take it slow.

With a part-time program, this gives you the best of both worlds - you keep your cash flow, gain real-world experience (be it through internships, jobs, love, holiday, etc.), and let the *learning sink in*, properly. 

**We emphasise on 1 class a semester.** It's tried & tested. 

Why rush & then burn yourselves out for a piece of paper that won't guarantee stability? Mastery doesn’t come from cramming, it comes from building knowledge steadily, applying and reflecting them, and then positively and creatively reinforcing them. 

**Life’s not just a race.** Go at your pace.

Doldam-gil in Damyang-gun, Jeollanam-do, is a quiet walking path where you can experience the charm of a traditional Korean countryside village. The stone walls and hanok houses lining both sides of the path create a warm, peaceful atmosphere that makes the walk itself soothing.

Around Doldam-gil, you’ll find hanok-style guesthouses and cafés, offering a close-up experience of traditional Korean architecture. Many cafés serve traditional Korean teas such as ssanghwa tea, plum tea, and ginger tea, along with coffee and other beverages—perfect for enjoying a relaxing moment.

The natural scent of wood and the calm ambiance of the hanok buildings add an extra layer of tranquility to your visit.

A short walk from Doldam-gil brings you to the Changpyeong Traditional Market and a street filled with local gukbap (rice soup) restaurants, where you can enjoy anything from light market snacks to a filling meal.

Damyang’s Doldam-gil may not be a flashy tourist spot, but it’s one of the best places to experience the everyday beauty and traditional scenery of Korea.

The coffee is amazing, and I’m really loving the fruitiness of it. I’ve never experienced that flavor before.

I’ve tried 3 methods: 

Fully closed: 30 second bloom in closed position , then the rest of the water. 

Partial closed: 30 second bloom in closed position, then the rest of the water in pour over method.

Full pour over: 30 second bloom in open position and then the rest of the water.

I seem to get the most fruit flavors in the full pour over method and I’m just wondering why that is. I assumed I would get more via the immersion method, but that ends up tasting more like traditional coffee.

Is anyone else blown away by how massive online gaming has become in just the last few years? I was looking at some statistics recently and my mind is genuinely boggled.

We're talking about 3.2 BILLION people playing online games worldwide now. That's literally 40% of the human population. The online casino industry alone is projected to hit $100 billion by 2026. Mobile gaming revenues have surpassed both PC and console gaming combined. Twitch streamers are making millions just from people watching them play slots or poker online.

But here's what really gets me - it's not just young people anymore. My 65-year-old mom is obsessed with online bingo and slots on her iPad. My boss runs a poker game every Friday night... online. Even my grandmother knows what Candy Crush is. The pandemic obviously accelerated everything, but this train isn't slowing down.

The accessibility is what changed everything, I think. You don't need a $2000 gaming PC or even a console anymore. Your phone is a portable casino, arcade, and social gaming platform all in one. You can play a quick hand of blackjack while waiting for your coffee, jump into a battle royale on your lunch break, or spend your evening on a virtual poker table with friends from five different countries.

And the social aspect? Game-changer. Online gaming isn't solitary anymore. It's communities, friendships, even relationships. I've made genuine friends through gaming Discord servers that I've later met IRL. The combination of gaming and social media has created this whole ecosystem that didn't exist even 10 years ago.

What's really wild is how normalized it all is now. Remember when saying you played video games as an adult was considered weird? Now it's weird if you DON'T have at least one gaming app on your phone. Online gaming went from niche hobby to mainstream entertainment faster than any medium in history.

The money following it is insane too. VCs are pumping billions into gaming startups. Traditional casinos are scrambling to build online platforms. Even luxury brands are creating virtual items for games. When Gucci is designing skins for games and crypto casinos are sponsoring Premier League teams, you know we've entered a new era.

Anyone else feel like we're living through a complete transformation of entertainment? Where do you think this goes in the next 5 years?",1,1764165153.0,elkgames,0,1.0,False

Also a caffeine question…","Hello just curious. I was never really prone to migraines at any point until basically when I hit 40 or was close to it. Being a social drinker for a couple decades…. I would drink whatever on weekend and my golf days. Of course if I over consumed I would have a normal next day headache/hangover.

However now I’m my 40’s. Any type of alcohol I can 85% of the time start to feel the headache coming on just after maybe 2 drinks or so, and before any “alcohol related”effects kick in. 

So I’m wondering if it’s possible develop this new trigger over the past few years? Or is it not likely?


On that same note, the only difference I can think of that has changed these past few years. Is I started drinking more caffeine. I never really was a coffee drinker before but I do have a 20plus ounces almost everyday. And also I’ve developed the bad habit of the (low calorie/sugar) energy drinks. (About 200mg on average)

Wondering if the caffeine could be having an influence on the alcohol trigger? They say the half life of caffeine is 6 hours. I usually never have coffee or an energy drink past lunch. 

I know they say caffeine is a slight dehydrator….but come on coffee is just bean water, and water/sodium in the energy drink so I don’t really buy that part of it.

Just wondering if the first part of developing a trigger later in life is possible and/or if the caffeine could be playing a role in the reason why I can have more than a couple drinks? Any thoughts are appreciated.",1,1764165125.0,migraine,1,1.0,False

He was sitting up and I moved to grab my coffee.

He cried out for just a moment but I told him he’s okay he just bumped his head and picked him up. But I did hear the hit. I touched his head and didn’t feel any bumps and he calmed down as soon as he was picked up. Then I danced around with him a bit and he was laughing out loud within moments. 

My only concern is because it was backwards. He’s slipped down into the side before and it’s never been a big deal, he just rolls over. I don’t understand if maybe the mat was just thinner in that area or what. 

Thoughts on that? I’m aware you’re not medical professionals but is this something you’d be freaking over?

I used to get coffee before work and would get handed a fountain large, but this morning I got handed what looked like a medium but is labeled as a large in McCafé drinks. When did they make this change? 

I’m just confused, I woke up hungry and went to get breakfast with a picture in my head of what I wanted, came home and am kinda just mad cuz what I expected is not what I got🤣😭

I’m putting this out there because I’m realizing I’m a bit ""malnourished"" when it comes to male energy in my life. I live in a house full of wonderful women (mom, aunt), and my closest friends are girls, but I’m missing that specific ""brotherhood"" energy. The rougher, grounded, ""yang"" energy that you just can't get from female friends.

I’m a bit of a ""spiritual weirdo"" (into shamanic work, psychology, and deep diving into the mind), and I feel like a massive outsider in the typical gay scene. The apps feel like a meat market where nobody talks, and the bar scene isn't my vibe. I’m looking for guys who actually want to *connect;* whether that’s gaming, hiking, talking about the universe, or just chilling in silence without the pressure to perform.

I’ve been through a lot recently and it’s made me realize I want a tribe, not just a temporary hookup. I’m in the Westchester/NYC area, so hanging out in person would be awesome (let's get coffee or walk somewhere green), but I’m open to chatting with bros worldwide who get the feeling of being an ""outsider"" in the community.

If you’re tired of the superficial stuff and want a genuine bro-connection, hit me up.

Over the weekend, I was watching my four year old niece. We were in her playroom and the floor is carpeted. I had just had a coffee and felt the sudden urge to pass gas. Of course it slipped out and was thankfully muffled by the carpet. She didn’t react and the smell seemed to disappear. About 10 minutes later, we are upstairs getting her ready for a quick bath and my brother in law yells up - “Niece, did you poop your pants? Auntie, can you check her pants please? Her play room smells god awful!”

1p77vmw,https://youtu.be/ppRz6Hqoics,You created a fresh ETH wallet for privacy? Cool. Now how are you funding it without linking it back to you?,"Here's the thing about Ethereum that nobody wants to admit: imagine paying for coffee with crypto and the barista instantly seeing your entire net worth. That's absolutely untenable, right? But that's literally how it works today if you don't have the tools and know-how to operate onchain PRIVATELY. 

Every transaction broadcasts your balance; every address you interact with is permastained as part of your public financial history; and most people try to ""fix"" this by creating a fresh wallet and funding it from Coinbase (not cypherpunk) or their main account (gg; no re)

Congrats, you just created a permanent public link on Etherscan that anyone can follow.

Creating a new wallet is easy. Funding it *privately* without linking it back to your identity? That's the hard part most tutorials skip.

Good news is... there's a few tools and methods for protecting your safety and financial dignity! 

This is the type of info that shouldn't be gatekept, so here's 3 ways you can fund a new wallet address privately:

1. **Railgun (Zero-Knowledge)** – Shield funds into a private pool via Railway Wallet, then unshield to any fresh 0x address. Takes \~1 hour for PPOI checks, but mathematically breaks the onchain link, and is compliant 👍. Uses actual zero-knowledge proofs, not marketing BS.
2. **zkp2p (Bank → Crypto P2P)** – Uses zkTLS to prove Venmo/CashApp/Wise/etc payments without exposing personal data. Funds can be designated straight to a new wallet. Zero crypto footprint in your banking app because it just looks like you're sending $ to a friend!
3. **OTC (Old School)** – Cash-for-crypto with trusted peers. High risk, requires strict safety protocols (public meetups, locked rates, verify token contracts), but it's what early OGs did pre-CEX.

Privacy shouldn't have to be explained. It's basic dignity. In this case, basic FINANCIAL dignity. Your net worth shouldnt be public info just because you want to use crypto.

For my latest youtube video, I go into exactly all of this! I hope ppl find it helpful :)

Here's What I Actually Do...,"Whenever I'm at a party and someone asks what I do, I say 'digital marketing.' I see a little spark in their eyes. They imagine a room full of creatives, whiteboards covered in genius ideas, maybe some high-stakes client pitches over whiskey like something out of Mad Men.

Let me pull back the curtain for you. My 'creative brainstorming' is me, alone, staring into the glow of three monitors at 2 AM. My world is a massive, seemingly endless sea of spreadsheets. I live and breathe Google Ads. My job is to basically play a high-stakes auction game with other marketers over keywords that sound completely insane out of context, like 'emergency plumber near me' or 'best ergonomic office chair for back pain.'

I spend hours, fueled by an unhealthy amount of coffee, hunting for the perfect combination of words that will make someone click. It’s part psychology, part data science, and part pure guesswork. Then there’s the adrenaline rush and the stomach-dropping fear of checking campaign performance. You've either spent a client's $5,000 budget to perfection and doubled their sales, or you've just… spent $5,000. The reports don't lie, and they are merciless.

It’s not glamorous. It's not witty taglines over cocktails. It's the quiet, intense pressure of numbers. But when you find that perfect keyword, write that killer ad copy, and see the conversion rate skyrocket? That’s a win that feels pretty damn good, even if you're the only one in the room who understands what it means.

So, Reddit marketers, what’s the biggest misconception people have about your job?",1,1764164104.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False
1p77vcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Students/comments/1p77vcb/i_didnt_expect_ai_agent_to_save_my_ass_on_a/,I didn't Expect AI Agent to Save My Ass on a Client Project,"A couple weeks ago, I took on a side project after class aiming to earn some pocket money. A local coffee shop wanted a simple website. They just want  menu, hours, some photos. No big deal.

Then I opened their assets.

Six different logos. Random photo formats. Menu half in Google Docs, half on crumpled paper. I spent two hours just sorting files and immediately regretted saying yes.

Out of desperation, I resolted to a tool I’d seen my friend's working with – Skywork. I prompted in the chat box:
“Build a clean, modern coffee shop site from these assets.
Ignore duplicates.
Use a theme color from the photos.
Fill in missing menu text.”

I would admit I expected trash.
However, it surprised me with a full project: it gave me a designed page with home, menu, contact, even an “About” page. Not perfect, but the folders made sense, colors were matched, typography was fine. For the first time, it felt shippable.

I spent about 40 minutes in VS Code, where I fixed the spacing, swapped fonts, and rewrote copy. Because the output was all real code, it felt easy for me to edit. I then sent the draft to my client, and he thought I’d been working on it all week.

I didn’t start using Skywork because I wanted to explore a new tool. It just rescued me at the time I was not able to deliver a project. It quietly became my go-to for stuff I hate: starting layouts, cleaning messy assets, boilerplate pages, cursed CSS, turning client brain dumps into structure.

Did anyone else have an AI tool sneak into their workflow like that? Not from hype, just when “I need help right now” came to your mind.

(Parallel to Chapter 5 — CJ’s Training Begins — Updated With New Dialogue)

Far beneath Coney Island—
past the old tunnels, past the sand, past the forgotten concrete foundations—
lay a fortress carved into bedrock.

A Team Rocket bunker.

Pipes clanged above.
Machines hummed.
Shadow Pokémon growled behind reinforced glass.

Nightfang stood before a towering monitor wall, replaying the same video.

The battle on the pier.

CJ Powers throwing himself in front of Shadow Zapdos.
Charmander taking the hit.
CJ dragged underwater.
Mew rescuing them in a flash of blue light.

Nightfang watched it again.
And again.
Frame by frame.

He zoomed in, stopping on the shimmering golden figure standing beside CJ.

A shiny Charmander.

Nightfang’s mask hissed sharply.

Nightfang (distorted):
“It’s him.
That rare Pokémon… belongs to him.”

He moved to a command console.
His fingers typed fast and violently.

League encryption collapsed.
Trainer registration logs unlocked.
Passwords fell like paper walls.

Within seconds, he had the profile.

TRAINER: CJ POWERS
REGISTERED POKÉMON: SHINY CHARMANDER
HOME REGION: CONEY ISLAND

Nightfang whispered the name.

Nightfang:
“CJ Powers… so that’s who you are.”

Behind him, Trish leaned against a table, spinning a black knife idly.
Black skirt.
Tall boots.
Fishnet top.
Her expression: amused chaos.

Trish:
“Well well… look who survived the pier.
Cute kid.
Lucky brat.”

Nightfang didn’t respond.

He opened CJ’s life data—
the places he visited,
the cafés he liked,
the shops he checked into,
the streets he walked,
the entire digital fingerprint of his daily routines.

One by one, Nightfang read the names.

Nightfang:
“Surf Avenue Coffee Co.”
“Bright Bean Espresso.”
“Pier Point Smoothies.”
“Luna Grounds Café.”
“Steeplechase Noodle House.”

Trish tilted her head.

Trish:
“Sooo… what’s the plan?
Destroy every place that made him smile?”

A pause.

Nightfang’s mask hissed.

Nightfang:
“Yes.
Every place that shaped him.
Every warm memory.
Every safe corner.”

Then the console beeped.

A location update.

CJ POWERS — ALIVE
CURRENT LOCATION: NEW JERSEY

The mask tightened with a long, angry breath.

Nightfang:
“You fled across the water…”
“You think running will save you.”

He activated the Rocket strike network.

Nightfang:
“To all strike teams — deploy now.”
“Burn down CJ Powers’ home.”
“Destroy every place on the list.”
“Erase his life from Coney Island.”

Shadow Pokémon roared.
Vans revved deep in the underground tunnels.
Dozens of Rocket operatives sprinted to gear up.

Trish hopped off the crate and walked closer to him—
close enough to hear the faintest clicks of his mask valves.

She looked up at him quietly.

Trish (softly):
“Nightfang…
Can I ever see your face?”

The question froze the air.

Nightfang didn’t turn.

Didn’t breathe.

Finally, he lifted a single hand—
touching the edge of his steel mask.

A slow hiss escaped.

Nightfang (low):
“…No.
Not yet.”

Trish stepped closer.

Trish:
“Why?
You don’t trust me?”

Nightfang finally turned his head just slightly.

Only the glowing eyes of the mask looked back at her.

Nightfang:
“It’s not you.”
“I’m not ready.”
“These scars…
these burns…
They are not for anyone to see.”

Trish blinked, surprised.

Her voice softened.

Trish:
“You know I wouldn’t judge you.”

Nightfang shook his head once.

Nightfang:
“I will show my face the day I reclaim what was stolen.”
“When justice is delivered.”
“When CJ Powers pays for surviving.”

He turned back to the monitor—
to the image of CJ Powers standing beside the glowing shiny Charmander.

Nightfang:
“He survived once…”
“…but he will not survive again.”

Above them, Rocket vans blasted out onto Surf Avenue—
headed toward CJ’s home,
toward his cafés,
toward his cherished memories.

Fire would follow.

Nightfang watched in silence.

Nightfang:
“When you return, CJ Powers…
there will be nothing left.”

I've been taking mostly Japanese knotweed, cats claw, houttuynia, cistus, cryptolepis, sida acuta, chinese skullcap and some others, but these are the main ones..

I've been taking them for 8 months, first 2 months herxed badly on them and I did get improvement...

But in the past 4 months, I've been frustrated,because I don't react anymore to any of the herbs I'm using and I also don't get any further improvement and I'm far from being healthy..

In fact, I experimented with some days of fasting, it did turn the symptoms back, but as soon as I would eat again, I'd actually feel the bacteria rush back into position to attack my whole body... Tried drinking my herbal teas and tinctures, doesn't even phase them ( except some ivermectin seems to slow it to a certain degree)

Until I dropped a few drops of cinnamon essential oil into my coffee and my whole body ( brain included) is reacting to it!

I tried adding some drops of oregano, clove and cinnamon oil in olive oil, and then into caps yesterday... Definitely gave me a strong herx! Felt like my whole body was beaten up waking up this morning...

But the problem is, I do feel like I won't be able to take these essential oils long term because it will tax my liver.. it felt a bit sore in the morning..

I have liposomal oregano/clove/cinnamon caps, and I have some effect from it, but not as much as the pure oils.. and frankly, the liposomal oils are very expensive and hard to get here in Europe..

So, idk, I'll continue to add just 2 drops of cinnamon oil to my coffee for now, see how my liver will accept it..

we met back in middle school. he was one of those kids everyone knew. junior basketball first, then varsity. i was the new student, drifting around quietly, and somehow during a school play we ended up talking. by eighth grade he was telling his friends i was his best friend. i thought he was teasing until a rumor about me spread and he confronted the person behind it. i didn’t think he’d ever go that far for me. in senior year, he got into a fight, and someone literally fetched me from my classroom because apparently i was the only one who could calm him down. when i got there, people were whispering outside the door. i stood next to him and told him to breathe, and he finally did. he sat down, pushed his hair back, and settled. i watched a lot of his games, and every time he scored, he'd glance at me and smile like he was proud. it felt good, being that close to someone.

after high school, we enrolled in the same strand, humss. we're both aiming for political science. we celebrated by having coffee and cake in a small café. he refused to let me pay. at one point, he rested his head on my lap like it was the most natural thing, and i didn’t know why, but i felt uneasy. i didn’t want to ruin the moment though, so i just let it pass.

then college came, and the pandemic threw everything off course. i ended up studying medical technology while he went on with political science. we still talked from time to time, like we were trying to hold onto something familiar.

and then one call changed everything.

i was studying for my hematology finals. no sleep, too much coffee, my brain barely working. it was the first day of simbang gabi when he called. he had messaged earlier saying he wanted to talk. it was almost 5 a.m., so i paused my studying and picked up.

he told me he had a dream about me. not friendly, not romantic. it's the kind you don’t ever expect to hear from someone you trust. he sounded drunk, so i just listened, trying to steady myself because i felt the ground shifting under me.

then he went further. he was in his room, and i heard him close the curtains with a remote. he started doing things i never consented to hear, never wanted to be part of. i could hear everything, and i felt myself shutting down, feeling dirty in a way i still can’t fully explain.

when he finished, quite fast to be honest, he said a few sweet things, like he thought that would soften it. then he ended the call, leaving me there, stunned and shaking. no space to ask, to understand, to even breathe.

after that, i blocked him. i erased him from my life. later on, when i met an old friend, i found out he fought someone for speaking about me in a sexual way. but even that didn’t matter anymore. i still felt violated.

i didn’t care that he was attractive, tall, or well-off. none of that mattered. i felt disrespected as a woman. i’m not flirtatious. i can barely look people in the eye when they talk to me. and the part that stings the most is that the person who broke that boundary was someone i truly believed would protect me.

all i know now is that he’s studying law in san beda. he still dresses the same, that quiet kind of wealth, and he graduated with latin honors in college. he tried to follow me again on social media, but i ignored every request. sometimes i ask myself if that makes me a bad person, or if i should’ve let him follow me just so he could explain. but whenever i remember what happened, that same weight settles in my chest. so i chose to keep my distance. and i still don’t know if that was wrong, or if it was simply the safest thing i could do for myself.",2,1764163381.0,RantAndVentPH,0,1.0,False

Some mornings I run out of time and can’t take out the trash or finish washing dishes before I leave. 

Today I’m meeting my husband at my mother in laws directly after work. I left a duffle bag, 1 small bag and a pair of boots by the door for him to bring to the car with him when he leaves today. He responded that I’m selfish and don’t consider his time because I knew he had an appointment this morning. I also didn’t wash all the dishes and he’s annoyed he now has to do that before leaving. He says his time is never considered and he always going back and forth from our apartment to his mom’s house for various reasons. He thinks that we don’t think he actually has work to do since he works from home. He’s constantly saying things like this if I ask him to do something in the apartment during the day. I told him I wouldn’t ask him to do anything during his work day and I never expect anything additional to get done especially if he’s busy but sometimes being the one at home means if there’s a repair or something you’re waiting for that person to come.

i criticize the routines society imposes on us, not necessarily because they are bad in themselves,going to the gym,eating well,following fashion trends,drinking coffee at trendy cafes,posting on social media,attending events,participating in curated hobbies,all of these can be positive but the question is would we still do them if nobody was watching if they didn’t come with that added layer of attention, validation or social belonging?

Not On My Watch : A Mall Cop Fantasy romp
Have you got what it takes to stand in with your fellow watchers on the walls as your beloved mall is beset by fantasy hijinks?

The Setting
Somewhere in the heart of America lies a sprawling fantastical mall with all the sundries one could ask for.
Your favorite store? It’s got two. Favorite restaurant? It’s got two, one in each foodcourt. But also. On this bright morning it is your final bastion. For you must defend this place by any means necessary.
I, the shadowman am master of this mall and your tormentor. I drive the villainous impulses and want to take your mall for my very own, through the actions of my Masterminds you’ll be meeting very soon.

The Players fair
Our inept mall security professionals are now the last line of defense against a veritable parade of fantastical holiday themed threats. Players start with a selection of where their character lies on a 1-6 scale. You’ll have to roll a d6 for actions, and try to score higher or lower depending on the action in question. 3/4 are safest, 2/5 are risky and 1/6 are nearly unplayable (burn bright and fast if you wish I suppose)

Cop-ish skills like investigation and violence you’ll have to roll under your decided number.
Candy skills like relating to being nice and feeling emotions you’ll have
to roll over your decided number.
Matching your selected number counts as a success and extra.

You May roll one extra die for something you’re prepared to do and another die for something you are an expert in.
Help out = by adding to the narrative of the attempted action other players can assist with the roll.
Characters that lean towards cop (higher number) have more health, but have trouble being nice. Sweet characters (lower number) will struggle with combat and straight edge duties.
Example high difficulty characters -
Robocop {6} - if it’s coppin you got it nailed to the wall. If it takes some sweetness it ain’t gonna come from you
The Sugar Plum Fairy {1} - All sweetness, no substance. You’ll never lift your wand in anger

Your character’s HP (HyPoglycemic index) can be tracked on a special edition spindown d6 (all of em). With the following general conditions below. Your starting health is 2+ your selected number. For most characters that should put you at 5 or 6. Whenever you fail a roll or take a damage, your HP falls by 1.
8- I have become diabeetus 7- Overstuffed
6- Just right
5- Won’t say no to a snack 4- I could eat
3- hi hungry, I’m Dad 2- gettin a little sleepy 1- NOT TODAY DEATH 0- you’re outta here.
When health is at 1/2 the players can describe an embarrassing scene seeking sugar to recover. The more debasing or ridiculous this is, the greater the recovery.
Players at 0 will fall to the ground unconscious. They can be revived by other characters but require special resources or conditions.
There is no set turn order but there is a rule of cool. Which means no hoggin’. You must allow another player to attempt or take an action after each of your turns.

Additionally, players may select a number from 1-12 for a Days of Christmas roll. During rare moments of challenge players may roll for Christmas magic. If you hit this exact number, a fantastical spell of great power resembling the selected day’s gifts will allow the player to make a great change to the story.
If for some reason you don’t remember, One partridge (in a pear tree) , Two turtledoves, Three French hens, Four a-calling birds, Five golden rings, Six geese a laying, Seven swans swimming, Eight maids milking, Nine ladies dancing, Ten lords leaping, Eleven pipers piping, Twelve drummers drumming

Get Your Jevin Kames name!
If you don’t want to take the name/performance of another fictional policeman then you can roll on this table to assemble your ridiculous name here

Roll 1d6 per column to make your mallcop name or just choose four or more at random and you save the mall Bullbullbullbull don’t let my goofy ass tell you how to play this game

You can also use this time to come up with nonsense catchphrases or one liners if you really want to commit to the spirit of the inspirational vessel from which this game draws.

Mastermind : Some fantasy, all criminal
These are the outlaw leaders you will have to defeat to save the mall. Mostly you will want to engage them in combat. But most scenarios will require additional focus to keep the evil plans from succeeding.
In any situations, if all characters lose all their health, Evil has won.

Puck, Facefibbing Fae : this shapeshifting Pooka is a conniving foe. When Puck is selected as the mastermind he is secretly assigned to a player character as a secretive betrayer. Puck’s intention is to lead the players away from the heist being performed by his team, the midsummernight players. The players can be spotted wearing black suits and venetian masks. They are flighty when spotted but will attempt to avoid violence. Puck rewards mean spirited pranks between the players and anyone else. When the mall is enchanted under Puck’s spell, fooling and lying are rewarded. Within reason at MallMaster’s discretion players can gain Faerie gold by making jokes, or harming others (including Puck). Faerie gold can be exchanged by any player to cast cantrips, to learn more about the mall.
The most important cantrip players will be armed with is “Compel Truth” which forces all players (excluding Puck) to answer truthfully a yes or no question. Puck is able to lie during these interactions but only if their fingers are crossed.
Accompanying Puck’s antics are a set of thick iron manacles, the FootLocker. The goal of the players is to locate these shackles and place them upon Puck’s legs. This will end Puck’s enchantments but does not impede the Midsummernight Players. Puck does not have to be captured for the players to win.
Evil Wins If the Midsummernight Players are able to complete their heist and escape the mall.

The Rat King, Candyland Tyrant : The three headed lord of rats has taken sole control of Candyland without a Nutcracker to defeat him. Fortunately for you the Nutcracker has been brought to the mall as well. Have two players roll a d6 and add them, this will comprise the Nutcracker’s health. Generally this will be low. Even if it’s a higher number the Nutcracker is in a wounded state and relies on the players to help him move. At the cost of weighing down the character carrying him, the Nutcracker is a fierce attacker who will help clear the droves the Rat King brings with him. But when in conflict with the three headed monster himself, the beleaguered wooden soldier will be his primary target. The Sugar Plum Fairy is not present (as she could be a playable character in place of villains) but the Chocolate, Coffee, Tea, Candy Cane, Ginger, Marzipan, Flower dancers are now under the control of the Rat King. They’ll be sent to different areas of the mall while the Rat King hides in a makeshift fortress. Defeating or interrogating other groups of sugar people will give the players more hints to the location.
Evil Wins If the Nutcracker falls to zero and cannot be revived.

Frau Pfefferkuchenhaus, Cookie Converter : Frau P or Cookie The Witch if ya nasty causes a unique situation. Of the hostage variety. There are collections of survivors in the mall. The players must deliver savory foods before the witch and her enchanted oven convert the survivors into large gingerbreadmen(and women and others). Evil wins if the survivors are all turned to cookies. The closer FP draws to survivors, the faster her enchantment sets in. The easier course to victory is to attack FP and her Oven, but she can be disarmingly sweet and casts aggressive candy magic when threatened.
In most scenarios, FP will start at (a) Great American Cookies and seek the closest survivors. Her oven is like a clawed bathtub that follows behind her and spits peals of fire magic.
Evil Wins If Frau Pfefferkuchenhaus is able to turn all the survivors into gingerbread persons.

Krampus, Vindictive Punisher : This towering goat shaped demon creature stalks the mall in search of the players to beat them with birch rods. Attacking Krampus is not advised.
Krampus’ goal is to locate the “naughtiest” player and take them back with him out of the mall. In place of a team, Krampus places traps around the mall the players will have to navigate. Krampus has chains laden with bells and stomps with his cloven hooves. Players can repel Krampus in one of two ways. A small gratitude will push back Krampus if he approaches. However an admission of a misdeed will send Krampus’ attention away to one of the other players.
To fully defeat Krampus, the players must locate St. Niklaus who is hidden and trapped himself. As players show gratitude or admit their faults St. Niklaus grows in strength and tries to call out to players by humming Santa Claus themed songs. When St. Niklaus is found, the players can banish the Krampus by holding hands with Father Christmas and declaring “Thank you, Krampus.”
Evil Wins If St. Niklaus can’t be rescued

The Mayflower : (read) With a crash, a wooden ship full of pilgrims lands in the mall. In their incoherent rage they lash out and attack modern conveniences at random. The pilgrims must be subdued to preserve the integrity of the mall itself. Myles Standish and the other pilgrims are most preoccupied with electronic devices they perceive to be sinful/devilish. But being a strategist, he quickly understands how electricity works and seeks to rout all of the perceived evil. Pilgrims are less than trained fighters but react negatively to things like segways and tasers.

I was thinking about  the way life is so different. Yesterday I got off work. Knowing I’m going to be off for 10 days. I would have went to the bar last night when I was drinking. Been so hungover today that I’d have to drink everyday. Including the day of going back to work. Towards the end there I was drinking a case of beer a day. 32 thanksgivings wasted while drinking. 

Last night I drove past a bar I used to go to. Thought about what I wanted to do today. I thought it was best to roll on home. & that’s what I did. My family here waiting with open arms.

(On a giant desktop he needs for technical reasons, in the dining room of our small city apt, so he can’t leave.) Meanwhile, I watch our baby and try to do some chores during the baby’s afternoon nap.

Now, the problem: My daughter will insist on coming home after like an hour. I pack a backpack full of snacks and high-value toys, and they go to the library, playgrounds, coffee shop, froyo shop, etc. But she will throw a huge tantrum until the babysitter brings her back. Then she keeps running over to climb into dad's lap. My daughter likes her babysitter a lot and they play very well at home, but it's pretty disruptive given the small apartment situation.

Is it reasonable to expect the babysitter to tough it out through her tantrums and keep her outside? Do we just need a higher-energy babysitter who can take her around the city to do more fun things and get her excited about them? (I think the whining about coming home is in part boredom because she will stay out a long time when her visiting grandparents take her out to the park, etc.) Anything I can do to coax the toddler to go along with our plan?

\--------------------

Morning slithered into the room while I was still immersed in my reading. I snapped into myself when Eklil invited me for breakfast. Judging by the droop of his ears and the redness in his eyes, he didn’t look like he’d slept much either.

After I bumped my shin twice on the low furniture, and bonked myself on a wooden beam, he took pity on me and brewed me what he called “a waking brew”.

I’ve had black tea plenty of time before. Back home it was a nice alternative to coffee that I could normally brew straight in a thermos and have it with me for those long days that started at sunrise and generally ended at sunrise the next day. It kept me awake.

This thing that Eklil brewed could have stripped the lining off my thermos.

It didn’t so much wake me after my sleepless night, as injected acid into my veins. If I focused, I was pretty sure I could see smells and taste sounds after the first sip. I could’ve probably used it to clean rust.

It got me *awake!*

And ravenous.

Eklil’s breakfast spread was delicious. It consisted of fresh fruit—selected with Eternity’s help—and a few chunks of roasted tubers, similar to what I ate the previous day. I was hungry enough that it didn’t matter where the calories came from, just as long as they filled my stomach. As I sat and ate in silence opposite Eklil, I reviewed the night’s conclusions.

My stats were, indeed, a guideline to development. They each had rather straightforward explanations that outlined their purpose. Strength made me build muscles, constitution developed my inner workings—heart, lungs, the general wetware of my physiology—while intelligence was set to develop my understanding.

That one had stumped me for a while, until I realised that I was already making use of the class attribute boost. This whole system would’ve been absurd to me when I woke up on Oresstria, but with the context of what I’d seen already and the hints from Eternity, it became clear that a small bump in the smarts area was making me far more receptive to how things worked here. Subtle.

I wasn’t going to become a genius, but the world would make more sense to me. I thought back on the training wheels analogy from before and it seemed even more fitting now.

Wisdom, for its part, worked as a catalogue. It would help me remember lessons. It was in the description. The higher the stat, the deeper the lessons would sink in and easier to use the conclusions.

In an interesting way, these first four stats worked together in twos. Strength and constitution. Intelligence and wisdom.

That only left willpower.

That one was an odd little thing since it worked more directly than the rest. It was related to mental fortitude and affected how I would handle… challenges. Those two points I’d dropped into the stat had gotten me past the shock of what I’d witnessed. Now, thinking of the bear and the possibility of meeting another like it didn’t fill me with dread anymore. I was afraid, yes—the wisdom of experience—but not terrified silly.

If this was the actual stat having an influence on me, or just morning bravado after a sleepless night, was impossible to tell. I chose to believe the former, and didn’t dwell on the fact that my mind was alterable. If I gave that idea any room to sprout, I’d never sleep again.

Eternity said I could even expand the stats list and gain *more* such attributes that I could level. The first five had been generated based on what would help me directly, though I couldn’t get more information than this. Why these specifically? Was it based on me? Was it based on some requirement of me? No idea. Eternity remained tight-lipped and a pain in the arse

But, at least now I had an inkling of understanding for my stats. Yay, me!

I’d spent the hours of the morning looking at skills. There were a lot of them, and I only had one skill point to spend. The first choice had been panic-driven, like everything so far, but I resolved not to let it become a habit.

\[ADRENALINE SURGE\] had proven far more powerful than I had anticipated. I know people can do amazing things when their adrenaline runs high, but to experience what I did when using it was… well, fantasy. What sort of biology was Eternity actually catering to?! Still, if that was so strong, I could only anticipate what some of the others could do.

The quiet time after breakfast, where Eklil and I sat in silence and sipped our steaming-hot battery acid, was given over to choosing on what I’d spend that skill point.

The options were varied enough.

\[CLING\]

\[BECOME ATTACHED TO ANY REASONABLE, FLAT SURFACE\]

\[COST: 5 MP / activation + 1 MP / second\]

Gotta love that *reasonable* thrown in there, like it would make the description clear in any way. This was the first available skill in my \[TRAVERSAL\] set, and it precluded all the others. Okay, I thought of Spider-Man the moment I read it, but I somehow doubted it would be that straightforward.

\[IRON FLESH\]

\[HARDEN A PART OF YOUR BODY IN ORDER TO MITIGATE INCOMING DAMAGE\]

\[COST: 5 MP / activation + 1 MP / second\]

\[3 MP to change targeted area while skill is active\]

I wasn’t mature enough not to smirk at this one. This was coming out of my \[SURVIVAL\] stack, which meant it would be aimed at keeping me alive… in theory, at least.

But the one that had caught my interest was a rather less interesting sounding one.

\[DETECT ENERGY FLOW\]

\[YOU CAN SENSE THE FLOW OF ENERGY AROUND YOU FOR A RADIUS OF UP TO 5 (FIVE) METRES\]

\[COST: 5 MP / activation + 1 MP / second\]

My MP pool was low and I didn’t yet figure how to gain more—which was something I was determined to wring out of Eternity. The first two skills sounded awesome, but with low MP they would only be active for just a few seconds. \[ADRENALINE SURGE\] stretched my perception of time so it was cheating its short activation window.

Could I use skills in combination, I wondered. \[ADRENALINE SURGE\] to help me react, then \[IRON FLESH\] to guard against some incoming blow? There was too little information for me to make a good decision.

But the \[DETECT ENERGY FLOW\] was just what I’d like to have on hand always. Okay, *energy* was a rather loosely defined term. Kinetic? Potential? Magic? It didn’t specify. But, given what I’d seen of \[ADRENALINE SURGE\] I could probably expect this to do a lot more than what I’d imagine. Getting that one would be a gamble, but my gut was telling me to go with it.

If nothing else, I could maybe see where Eternity’s blob was drawing its energy from and follow it to the source. There was never a shortage of reasons to punch Eternity in the blob.

“You are very introspective.” Eklil’s voice shook me out of my ruminations.

I had been staring out into nowhere for a while now. The tea had gone cold in my mug, only drunk halfway. I chugged the rest of it.

“Was just thinking on things,” I wheezed out as the brew clawed its way through me. “I have so many questions to ask. I don’t even know where to start.”

But there was one that I expected would happen. Someone would need to go back for the body. I wanted to do that, at least as… I don’t know. There was no way I was responsible for that iepurran’s death, but I felt like I was.

“I want to go and help recover the body of your kinsman,” I said, forcing myself not to think on the scene. “I want to help.”

“It has already been done, honoured guest,” Eklil said without looking up at me. “Kleopt has been laid to rest in his garden, next to his honoured father.”

My eyebrows shot up.

“Already?” I looked out through the slits in the shutters. It couldn’t have been more than an hour since dawn had broken properly. “And buried already?”

“Yes. His family has gone out in the dark to recover his body, protected by guards. They have performed the rites. He will be remembered, for he was well-loved.”

I had no idea what to say to that. There had been no wake, no wait, nothing… just a summary burial. For me, it didn’t feel quite right, but who was I to have an opinion on this? It was their way.

“Eternity?” I summoned the light. “Are there more of those things out there, do you think?” I asked, thinking on what to do next.

“Define *things*,” Eternity said without a hint of humour.

“Monsters. The kind that we fought last night.”

“Unknown. The probability is, however, high. We may see by day’s end.”

I waited for it to continue but it did not.

Eklil rose from his chair and took away the empty bowls from which we’d eaten, and the mugs. “Others have gone searching already.” When I opened my mouth to protest, he raised a hand and shushed me. “We learned. Our groups are bigger now. They travel armed and will not fight the monsters, only find them. We are making ready for a surge before the festival.”

Well, that left me twiddling my thumbs. I would’ve liked to go help with making the surrounding area safe, but I would’ve probably slowed down the groups who already knew the lay of the land.

Part of me also wanted to go and fight. It was a nascent thing, some ember that had caught a spark from that desperate splashing about and was now slowly growing. I wanted to fight and to gain more levels and test more skills. The project that was *me* would need a lot of those and, for now, I didn’t know of other ways of getting those levels aside from fighting.

The wall I ran into with my planning, and the reason why morning had found me so tired, was lack of information. Stats made some sense, but the lack of skill descriptions was a whole different issue. When I tried to get into the rune related skills, I had simply given up on trying to understand anything out of those vague descriptions.

\[RUNE SMITH: BASIC ELEMENT\]

\[GENERATE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK FOR A WORD OF POWER\]

\[COST: 30 MP / activation\]

What the bloody hell did that even mean?!

“Eternity, would insight give me better skill descriptions?” I asked.

“No,” came the answer. “You may gain more detailed descriptions, however.”

Right, language precision. I glared at the light until my eyes teared up. It didn’t seem to care

“Eklil, do you have an… interface?” I asked the old iepurran as he moved to fuss over his plants.

“I do, yes.”

“Does everyone?” I asked, picking at the thread. “If that’s alright to ask,” I added quickly, not wanting to upset my host. Far as I knew, asking about this stuff could be some insult that wouldn’t be forgiven for generations.

I doubted it… but better safe than sorry.

Eklil laughed.

“It is quite alright to ask, honoured guest,” he said while he clipped some yellowing leaves from a hanging plant. “Many of the town folk have renounced their interface once moving out here. We came here to enjoy simpler lives.” He let out a long, contented sigh. “We settled here, on the shore of the Ocean Eternal, to escape the trappings of modern life, and the dangers of the inner continent. Dungeons this far out are rarely dangerous.”

*Rarely* did not mean *never*, unfortunately.

“So, do you also have a class?” I asked.

“I do, yes. I am a Herbalogist.”

Huh, that was a neat-sounding class. Didn’t seem like a fighting one, though.

“What skills did you need to choose?” I asked, curiosity piqued. “To be given that class, I mean.”

Eklil looked at me with his head tilted to one side, as if confused.

“My class did not require me to select a skill,” he said after some time. “Our interface connects when we come of age. The profession we practice determines our class. We do not choose skills, we are gifted with them once the class becomes active.”

Well, that was a completely different experience from my own.

“Does that mean you can’t change your profession once the class is unlocked?”

Eklil shook his head. “No, no, honoured guest. If we grow tired of a class, we can abandon its path and select another. But we lose all the progress we have earned and it may not be regained.” Satisfied with whatever he’d been doing to that plant, he settled into the chair next to me and tapped on the table absently. “Our class is often our passion. Few want to change it once it’s unlocked. You are not from here so your experience might be different. Not every species interacts the same with their interface.”

It gave me some food for thought. In the meantime, just for something else to occupy myself with, I dropped my skill point into \[DETECT ENERGY FLOW\]. It seemed more useful for now in a general sense and, if I went into other dungeons and they functioned similarly, I could explore what made them tick.

As a bonus, my MP bar doubled in size.

*Neat. I get MP every time I learn a system skill?*

I made a mental note to check that with Eternity. For now, I was curious of what the skill actually did. It sounded safe enough to test indoors, even if I would probably not see anything at Eklil’s table. Safer, at least, than testing it out when I’m facing some half-crocodile-half-machine-horror beast in a river.

What was the worst that could’ve happened?

One mental command later and the world turned to static.

I woke on the floor, in a pool of my own vomit, with Eklil dabbing my forehead with a wet cloth. I came back to my senses with a gasp, rising as if from the grave itself. Eklil, to his credit, barely flinched as I screamed in panic.

“Wh-what happened?” I asked, head spinning. My MP bar was flashing red, completely drained.

My shoulders and hips hurt, like I’d been writhing about on the floor. There was cotton in my mouth, and razors, and a taste like I’d eaten dead skunk. I coughed and it hurt the back of my throat.

Eklil let out a sigh and dabbed the cloth on his own forehead.

“Gave me quite the fright, honoured guest,” he said as he picked himself up from the floor. “What skill did you activate?” He walked away from my mess, to return with a bucket and a bristly brush.

He handed those to me as I came to my feet and shrugged off the ruins of my already mangled t-shirt.

Aside from the fact that I had the morning’s tea and breakfast all over the floor, I didn’t feel… terrible, I guess. All the aches and pains subsided as my head cleared. They did leave behind a wallop of a headache. So, I hadn’t hurt myself, but gone in some kind of epileptic fit… well, more than that, I guess.

“Something called \[DETECT ENERGY FLOW\].” I got down on my knees and started cleaning Eklil’s floor as he went and perched back atop his chair.

He poured himself a fresh cup of tea. I wasn’t tempted.

“Which energy flow?” he asked.

“Uh… I’ve no idea.”

“Ah. So you’ve just tested a skill you did not know how to use, with an effect you were not aware of, inside the home of someone who is hosting you. Most unwise, honoured guest.”

Well, that would explain why my initial assessment had my wisdom at near nothing. I sunk my head, feeling chastised like a child. It had seemed safe, but the interface seemed to have its own concept of what *safe* meant.

“Everything is energy, honoured guest,” Eklil pointed out patiently. “Energy is in everything. In sound. In light. In the magic that flows through us. Some believe *we* are energy.”

“Not a completely incorrect assumption,” Eternity said from where it floated above the room.

I grumbled. Yeah, I figured that and probably should have expected it. The system skills all seemed to have some effects that were far more powerful than what the text suggested. It reminded me of the joke with the dictionary, where an old version simply had “Everyone knows what a horse is” as a definition for the word “horse”. Except I was now the guy who’s never seen a horse before.

“Eternity,” I called out as I finished washing the disgusting mess I’d made. “Can I fine tune what energy I want to sense?” I asked.

“Yes,” it answered.

“How?”

“Practice.”

Could I hit a blob of light with wire brush? As usual, it did not volunteer information. Before I figured out what particular stream of cussing I was going to use to show Eternity my appreciation for its hard work in helping me, Eklil gestured for me to follow him.

“Honoured guest, allow me to offer you the use of my bath,” he said.

I couldn’t help noticing how, after we stepped out, he walked upwind of me.

“That would be very kind of you,” I said as I emptied the bucket in a ditch.

“Next time, maybe, warn me before you test a new skill? I may be of assistance in predicting the outcome.”

I expect guests making a mess on the floor wasn’t something the iepurrans looked too kindly upon.

“I promise I will,” I said, contrite.

The bath itself was a separate building, in the Japanese style. They had a big ol’ tub made of burnt clay, with a fire pit dug beneath it. It was tall and wide enough to fit me. I drew my own water from Eklil’s backyard well while he lit a fire beneath the tub and left me to bathe while taking my clothes to be cleaned. I told him it wasn’t necessary, but he insisted. Instead, he left me with one of their togas. This one was white.

“Eternity,” I said as I soaked in the warm water, “let’s have a clearer collaboration. Can we?”

“Depends,” the light answered.

“On what?”

“On whether or not I can provide you with the information you need. I cannot bypass insight restrictions.”

I stared at the \[Insight Lvl: 1\] in my attribute sheet.

“How do I gain more insight?” I asked. “Do I want to gain more insight?”

This time Eternity took some time to answer, as if figuring what it could tell me. “Restoring a corrupted dungeon will grant you an insight level. I cannot answer your second question.”

Okay, that was still something. Clear dungeons. Get insight. Learn what the fuck’s going on. Not that bad. It was doable.

Now, for something completely unrelated.

“Can you change your shape?” I asked.

It was honestly annoying to walk around daily with a light bulb above my head. Not for nothing, but I wanted something a bit more expressive to interact with, and not seem like I constantly had a bright idea. It was demonstrably false that I had any bright ideas whatsoever by this point of my adventure.

“I can, yes,” Eternity answered, its tone just a bit dubious.

“Can you be anything?”

“Within reason.”

“Something out of my memories?” I asked, already picturing myself followed around by Mushu from Mulan, or Syl from The Stormlight Archives. Okay, the off-brand versions, probably, but still.

“If you focus on an image, I may be able to reproduce it.” It waited for a moment, then added. “Please do not consider improper use of this function. I do not approve of frivolous aesthetic modifications.”

I thought it more prudent not to ask what it meant by that last part, or how the decision had come into being. Years on the internet had taught me that most safety tags had disturbing stories behind them. For this, however, I wasn’t going to ask for some lewd stupidity, just something to make communication easier. If I could put a face to Eternity, I could deal better with its bouts of cryptic nonsense. A face added a personality after all… and something I could imagine punching.

But who? Or what?

“Hmmm,” I leaned back into the tub. It did fit me, but my feet stuck out the other side. It was… nice to soak for a bit, given all that had happened. I tried not to let those thoughts creep back in.

I tried not to let a lot of thoughts creep in at all, the kind that always find you when you’re in a tub. Instead, I ran various figures through my imagination.

Eternity morphed as I thought. First it became a miniature copy of Cortana, but I got the sense it didn’t really approve to be a half-naked blue lady. I don’t care what anyone thought, the Cortana from the second Halo game was the best one and Eternity reproduced the visual to a distracting degree.

A mean thought almost had me asking it to be Gollum, but then I’d be stuck with the creature. I don’t know which one of us would’ve gotten the rawer deal.

After a few more tries, I settled on the image of a tiny, hand-sized black dragon, like a more three-dimensional model of the Heroes 3 sprite. I always liked that unit. Eternity even flapped its wings as it hovered around my head, ultimately landing quietly on my shoulder.

“A dragon is an acceptable shape,” it said, its voice deeper now.

Given the size, the effect was comical. But hey, I had a dragon on my shoulder. How cool was that?",1,1764162520.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

In these 2 months he has burned through about $500 in money put on his books, from my grama and from selling some of his silver bar collection (under his direction, in which a portion went to grama to pay his share of the rent as he was her caregiver).
The jail won't tell me what he is buying, he has only said coffee, thermal ware, reading glasses(as his prescription glasses were metal frame so he was not allowed to have them), and candy.
Anyway, he has been demanding i take his debit card and withdraw $400 from his account to add to his books (he recently claimed he owes the jail medical $58 but did not say what for so idk), grama does not want me to do this, I don't really want to do this. I have been brushing him off by saying I could get in trouble since 1)I'm not listed on his account anywhere and 2) it's money from the government (disability).

Is it legal for me to go ahead and withdraw from his account, under his request, to add to his books?

After years of helping people plan for retirement, I've noticed something concerning: we're all so focused on hitting specific numbers that we forget what we're actually saving for. Let me share a quick story - I recently met someone who reached their ""magic number"" of $2 million but realized they had no idea what to do with their freedom. Talk about a wake-up call!

Let's flip the script on traditional retirement planning. Instead of starting with ""How much do I need to save?"" start with ""What kind of life do I want to live?""

Picture this: You're sitting down to plan your future, but instead of crunching numbers, you're dreaming about teaching art classes in Tuscany, starting a small coffee shop, or spending more time with your grandkids. These dreams should be driving your financial plan, not the other way around.

Create a future budget based on your ideal lifestyle - and be specific! Want to travel? Great! Break down how many trips per year, what kind of accommodations you prefer, and realistic costs. This approach makes saving feel purposeful rather than just accumulative.

Here's something most financial advisors won't tell you: sometimes we save too much. I've seen clients postpone joy for decades, missing out on experiences they could have afforded, all because they were fixated on a number that was unnecessarily high.

Remember, not all dreams require a massive nest egg. Maybe your perfect retirement involves a small garden, volunteering at the local animal shelter, and weekly game nights with friends. The key is understanding what truly brings you happiness versus what you think retirement ""should"" look like.

Watch out for lifestyle creep - that sneaky tendency to increase spending as your income grows. Ask yourself: ""Did that last salary bump actually make me happier, or am I just spending more because I can?""

Set meaningful milestones beyond just birthdays or account balances. Celebrate when you've saved enough to fund a specific dream or reached a goal that brings you closer to your ideal lifestyle.

Stay flexible with your dreams - they might evolve, and that's okay! Maybe that yacht you thought you wanted becomes less appealing than a cozy cabin by the lake. Your financial plan should be able to adapt alongside your changing vision.

The sweet spot is finding that balance between future security and present enjoyment. Calculate what you need to feel truly secure, then give yourself permission to enjoy life along the way.

What's your dream retirement looking like? Have you found yourself too focused on the numbers and not enough on the ""why"" behind them? Share your thoughts below - I'd love to hear how you're planning to make your retirement years truly meaningful! 🌟",2,1764162239.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

At the start of the year I opened the gym 20 minutes early for any kid who wanted to walk laps inside before first period. Nothing graded, no attendance taken, just ""if you show up, we walk."" It started because a few students told me they felt awful going straight from the chaos of the bus into academic classes and asked if they could ""chill and move a bit"" first.



Fast forward two months and my tiny walking group turned into 35 kids shuffling around the gym in the mornings. At first I thought they just wanted extra credit, but they never asked for it. They walk in half awake, drop their backpacks on the bleachers and start doing slow laps. The conversations are wild. One kid talks about his grandma's cooking, another is quietly practicing speech sounds, two girls are trading book recs, a kid with ADHD literally bounces in circles while telling me about his new hyperfixation on pigeons. One very anxious student started by walking right next to me in total silence, now he is the one reminding others ""phones away, this is walking time.""



The thing is, it changed my classes. On days when they walk first, they are calmer in PE later. Fewer blowups, fewer ""I hate this game"" moments. Some kids who never talked to each other before are now weirdly protective of their ""lap buddies."" I had a kid who constantly refused to dress out tell me last week, ""I still hate push ups but I like when we walk, my brain feels less loud."" It is the softest, most low tech intervention ever: cheap sneakers, bad gym lighting, and me power walking in circles trying not to spill my coffee.



Admin finally noticed because apparently our front office cameras now show a parade of kids heading to the gym every morning. AP came in, watched for five minutes and said ""this is great, we could use this as an intervention block for kids with behavior issues, we will put them all here with you."" My stomach kind of dropped. Right now it is voluntary and feels like their space. If it becomes ""the place they send the kids who messed up,"" I am afraid my regular walkers will scatter and the whole mood will shift from calm to punishment.



So I am torn. On one hand, I know movement is good and some of those behavior kids would probably benefit too. On the other, the magic of this little walking club seems to be that no one is taking data, no one is lecturing, and kids who are usually ""a problem"" get to exist without that label for twenty minutes. Has anyone else accidentally created something like this that admin then wanted to formalize. Did it survive once it got turned into an official program, or should I fight to keep this as our unofficial weird morning laps cult.

He handed me the paper. ""You've got a biological brother. Older. Name's Lorenzo Cattaneo. He's sending someone to pick you up.""
I blinked, keeping my face blank, but inside my chest something twisted. 
I lied and said I'd never heard of him, but I knew that name from my mother's unsent letters. 
I had brothers. Five of them.
""So you're the girl claiming to be my sister,' Lorenzo said, his gaze cold and assessing.
""Not claiming,"" I said. ""Proven.""
He studied me, his gaze hard. ""DNA can be faked. People lie. Especially spies.""
He stood, walking around the desk until he was standing in front of me. ""You show up here uninvited, with a record, a history of running, and a story that sounds insane. You think that makes you part of this family?""
""No. I don't want to be.""
Giovanni's voice was sharp. ""Then why are you here?""
""Because I was forced to and I didn't have anywhere else to go.""
Lorenzo stared at me for a long moment, then said, ""You should've stayed gone.""
The words hit harder than I expected.  The air felt too heavy. 
The noise in my head started again. 
You don't deserve to be here.
You ruin everything you touch.
You're just a mistake they forgot to erase.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The first thing Celestina noticed was the smell-bleach, plastic, and something faintly citrus, like someone had tried to scrub away the scent of death with lemon cleaner. Her head throbbed in slow, punishing waves, and her mouth felt like it had been stuffed with cotton and regret. When she tried to move, the world tilted. A sharp tug at her arm reminded her of the IV taped to her skin.
She blinked at the ceiling. White. Too white. The kind of white that made her eyes ache. For a second, she thought maybe she'd finally done it,finally escaped everything. But then the heart monitor beeped, steady and smug, and she groaned.
""Perfect,"" she muttered, voice cracked and dry. ""Still alive.""
The door opened with a hiss, and in came Ms. Grant, her CPS worker, heels clicking like a countdown to doom. Her hair was pulled into a bun so tight it looked painful, and her expression was the same one she always wore around Celestina ,somewhere between disappointment and exhaustion.
""Well,"" Ms. Grant said, crossing her arms. ""You've really outdone yourself this time.""
Celestina squinted at her. ""What happened to 'good morning, sunshine'?""
""You overdosed on alcohol and pills,"" Ms. Grant snapped. ""You could've died.""
Celestina gave a weak shrug, wincing as the IV tugged again. ""Could've.""
Ms. Grant's sigh was long and heavy, like she'd been holding it in for years. ""Your foster family has decided they can't keep you anymore. That makes thirty-six, Celestina. Thirty-six families.""
Celestina let out a dry laugh. ""Guess I'm collecting them like Pokemon. Gotta reject 'em all.""
The CPS worker didn't even blink. ""You think this is funny?""
""No,"" Celestina said softly, eyes fixed on the ceiling. ""But if I don't laugh, I'll cry. And crying's not really my brand.""
Ms. Grant pinched the bridge of her nose. ""The police are waiting outside. You're being charged with underage drinking and possession.""
Celestina groaned. ""Can't they at least wait until I'm out of the hospital? I'm still technically dying.""
When Ms. Grant left, a nurse came in with a folded pile of clothes-black jeans, a faded hoodie, and sneakers that looked like they'd been rescued from a lost-and-found bin. Celestina changed slowly, her body aching with every movement. The hospital gown fell to the floor like a shed skin. She caught her reflection in the mirror pale, hollow-eyed, hair tangled and dull. She looked like a ghost who hadn't realized she was dead yet.
She pulled the hoodie over her head, shoved her hands into the pockets, and squared her shoulders. She wasn't going to cry. Not here. Not in front of anyone.
Two officers entered, one older, one younger. The older one had a face carved from stone; the younger looked like he still got carded buying energy drinks. The older one read her rights in a voice that sounded like gravel and disappointment.
When they led her out, the hospital floor was cold under her sneakers. She walked with her chin up, pretending she didn't care that everyone was staring.
At the station, time crawled. The clock on the wall ticked louder than her heartbeat. She sat in a plastic chair for what felt like forever ,seven hours, maybe more watching officers come and go, paperwork shuffle, phones ring. No one looked at her. No one spoke to her. She was just another broken kid in a long line of broken kids.
Her mind drifted back to the night before, the bottle, the pills, the silence. She hadn't meant to go that far. She just wanted to stop feeling. Her stepbrother's face flashed in her mind-his smile, the way he used to call her ""kiddo"" like it was a secret name. Six years in a coma, and then gone. Just like that. The only person who ever made her feel like she wasn't a mistake.
She'd sat by his hospital bed every week, talking to him even when he couldn't hear. And then one day, he didn't need her voice anymore. The world had gone quiet after that. Too quiet.
The older officer from before came back, holding a paper cup of coffee. He set it down in front of her. ""You look like you could use this.""
Celestina eyed it suspiciously. ""You trying to poison me?""
He chuckled. ""If I wanted to, I'd have done it already.""
She took the cup, the warmth seeping into her cold fingers.
""You know,"" he said, leaning against the desk, ""when I was your age, I was in a bad place too. Got into fights, stole cars, thought the world was out to get me. Then one night, an officer caught me. Could've thrown me in juvie, but he didn't. He gave me a choice. Told me I could either keep running or start fighting for something better.""
Celestina stared into the coffee. ""And you picked better?""
He smiled faintly. ""Eventually. Took a few screw-ups first.""
She snorted. ""Guess I'm still in the screw-up phase.""
He nodded. ""That's okay. You've got time.""
Before she left, he handed her a small plastic bag. Inside were her personal items-her stepbrother's rings, her mother's necklace, and a folded photo of her family. Her real family. Her older brother, her baby sister, her mum and dad, all smiling, frozen in a moment that didn't exist anymore. She ran her thumb over her dad's face, then the necklace, the metal cool against her skin.
A few hours later, a woman arrived, tall, thin, dressed in a gray suit that looked too perfect. Her smile was wide, but her eyes didn't match it.
""Celestina,"" she said smoothly. ""I'm Dr. Voss. I run the Nordic Renewal Center in Denmark. We've been informed of your situation, and we'd like to help.""
Celestina blinked. ""You mean the rehab place?""
Dr. Voss's smile didn't waver. ""We prefer the term wellness program. We focus on healing the mind and spirit.""
""Sounds like a cult,"" Celestina muttered.
Dr. Voss tilted her head, still smiling. ""You'll find we're quite... transformative.""
Something about her voice made Celestina's skin crawl. It was too calm, too rehearsed. But the officer gave her a look that said don't push it.
""Fine,"" Celestina said. ""Let's get this over with.""
Before they left, Dr. Voss insisted on stopping by Celestina's foster home to collect her things. The drive there was silent except for the hum of the car engine. Celestina stared out the window, watching the gray Edinburgh streets blur past.
When they arrived, her foster mother opened the door with a tight smile that didn't reach her eyes. ""We packed her things,"" she said quickly, handing over a small duffel bag. ""We wish her the best.""
Celestina looked at the bag-barely half full. ""Wow,"" she said. ""Didn't realize I owned so much.""
Her foster father avoided her gaze. The house smelled like dinner-something warm and buttery and for a second, she hated them for it. For being normal. For moving on.
She unzipped the bag and frowned. ""Where's my sister's blanket? And the teddy?""
Her foster mother's smile faltered. ""We didn't think you'd need those anymore.""
Celestina's jaw tightened. ""You didn't think I'd need her anymore?""
Before anyone could stop her, she stormed past them into the house. The living room was spotless, like she'd never existed there. She found the blanket folded neatly on a shelf, the teddy sitting beside it. The teddy was old, one ear half-torn, the fur worn thin from years of being held. Her dad had given it to her when she was two,
She grabbed them both, clutching them to her chest.
When she turned, her foster mother stood in the doorway, pale and silent.
""Don't worry,"" Celestina said, voice shaking. ""I'm not coming back.""
Dr. Voss didn't say a word as they drove to the airport.
At the terminal, the air smelled of coffee and jet fuel. Her stomach twisted as she stared at the boarding gate. The staff at the counter smiled too wide, their voices too calm. Everything about it felt wrong.
She could almost hear her stepbrother's voice again-Don't trust people who smile like that, kiddo.
So she didn't.
When Dr. Voss turned to make a call, Celestina's pulse quickened. She scanned the terminal-crowds, noise, exits. Her heart pounded so hard it hurt. She took a step back, then another.
""Celestina?"" Dr. Voss's voice was syrupy sweet. ""Where are you going?""
Celestina forced a smile. ""Bathroom.""
Dr. Voss nodded slowly. ""Don't take too long.""
The moment she turned away, Celestina bolted.
She ran through the terminal, weaving between travelers, her duffel bag slamming against her hip. Her lungs burned, but she didn't stop. She ducked behind a vending machine, waited until Dr. Voss's heels clicked past, then slipped into another corridor.
Her hands shook as she scanned the departure board. New York - Boarding Now.
Perfect.
She sprinted toward the gate, heart hammering. The attendant barely looked up as she flashed the wrong ticket and mumbled something about a transfer. The scanner beeped green. She was through.
Celestina slumped into the window seat, her chest still heaving from the sprint through the terminal. Her duffel bag sat wedged between her legs, the zipper half-broken, the corner of her sister's baby blanket poking out. She tugged it back inside and zipped it shut, her fingers trembling.
The plane smelled like recycled air, coffee, and too many people wearing too much perfume. The hum of the engines vibrated through the floor, steady and low, like a heartbeat she didn't trust. She pressed her forehead against the cold window, watching the runway lights blur into streaks of gold and white.
Her seatmate, a middle-aged woman with a floral scarf and a book titled Finding Inner Peace, gave her a polite smile. ""First time flying?""
Celestina forced a smirk. ""First time running away from a cult.""
The woman blinked, unsure if it was a joke. Celestina turned back to the window before she could answer.
As the plane began to taxi, her stomach twisted. The captain's voice crackled over the intercom, calm and practiced. ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard Flight 217 to New York City. Estimated flight time is seven hours and forty minutes. Please fasten your seatbelts.""
Seven hours. Seven hours to think. Seven hours to regret.
The plane jolted forward, gathering speed. Celestina's fingers dug into the armrest. The engines roared, the ground blurred, and then, weightlessness. Her stomach dropped as the city fell away beneath her. Edinburgh became a patchwork of lights, then a smear of gold swallowed by clouds.
She exhaled slowly, her breath fogging the glass. ""Goodbye, Scotland,"" she whispered. ""You won.""
The flight attendants moved down the aisle, their smiles mechanical. One stopped beside her. ""Something to drink, miss?""
Celestina hesitated. ""Do you have whiskey?""
The attendant blinked. ""Juice or soda?""
""Right. Juice. Orange.""
She took the cup and sipped it slowly, the sweetness sharp against her tongue. Her reflection in the window looked older than sixteen eyes too tired, mouth set in a line that didn't belong on a kid's face.
She reached into her bag and pulled out the photo from the station. Her family stared back at her-her mum's soft smile, her dad's arm around her shoulders, her older brother grinning like he knew something she didn't, and her baby sister clutching the teddy bear that now sat in her lap. The edges of the photo were worn, the colors faded.
She traced her dad's face with her thumb. ""You'd hate this,"" she murmured. ""You'd tell me to stop running. To be brave.""
Her throat tightened. She shoved the photo back into her bag before the tears could fall.
The woman beside her glanced over. ""You okay, dear?""
Celestina forced a grin. ""Never better. Just escaping my tragic backstory.""
The woman gave a nervous laugh and turned back to her book.
Hours passed. The cabin lights dimmed, and the world outside turned black. The only sound was the steady drone of the engines and the occasional cough or rustle of a blanket. Celestina couldn't sleep. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw her stepbrother's face ,the tubes, the machines, the stillness. The way his hand had felt cold when she said goodbye.
She pulled the baby blanket from her bag and wrapped it around her shoulders. It still smelled faintly of lavender and home.
A flight attendant passed by, pausing when she saw the blanket. ""That's lovely,"" she said softly. ""Family heirloom?""
Celestina nodded. ""Something like that.""
The attendant smiled and moved on.
Celestina leaned back, staring at the ceiling. The hum of the plane was hypnotic, almost comforting. For the first time in months, no one was yelling at her, judging her, or trying to fix her. She was just... floating.
She imagined what Dr. Voss was doing right now-probably pacing the airport, heels clicking, fake smile cracking. The thought made her grin. ""Guess your cult's one member short,"" she whispered.
She closed her eyes and let the rhythm of the plane lull her. Her dreams were fragmented,her stepbrother laughing, her dad lifting her onto his shoulders, her mum singing softly while folding laundry. Then the images twisted-sirens, flashing lights, the sound of her own heartbeat slowing.
She woke with a start, breath shallow. The cabin was dark except for the faint glow of reading lights. The woman beside her was asleep, mouth slightly open, book resting on her lap.
Celestina turned back to the window. The sky outside was endless black, dotted with stars. Somewhere below, the ocean stretched on forever. She pressed her palm to the glass, feeling the cold seep into her skin.
""Hey,"" a voice whispered.
She turned. A flight attendant crouched beside her, a young guy with tired eyes and a kind smile. ""You okay? You've been awake the whole flight.""
Celestina shrugged. ""Can't sleep. Too much turbulence in my brain.""
He chuckled quietly. ""I get that. Want some water?""
She nodded. He handed her a bottle, and for a moment, she almost thanked him. But the words stuck in her throat.
""Thanks,"" she finally muttered.
""No problem,"" he said, standing. ""We'll be landing soon. Try to relax.""
Relax. The word felt foreign.
As the first hints of dawn touched the horizon, the captain's voice returned. ""Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be beginning our descent into New York shortly. Local time is 6:12 a.m.""
Celestina's stomach twisted again. She looked out the window as the clouds parted, revealing the city below, an ocean, lights, skyscrapers piercing the morning haze. It was beautiful and terrifying all at once.
The plane dipped lower, the engines whining. Her ears popped. The woman beside her stirred awake, stretching. ""Almost there,"" she said cheerfully.
Celestina nodded, gripping the armrest. ""Yeah. Almost.""
When the wheels hit the runway, the jolt rattled her teeth. The passengers clapped softly, and she rolled her eyes. ""Congrats, we didn't die,"" she muttered.
As the plane taxied to the gate, she shoved the blanket and teddy back into her bag, zipped it tight, and slung it over her shoulder. Her heart pounded. She didn't know what she was going to do next, no plan, no money, no one waiting for her. But she was free.
When the seatbelt sign dinged off, she stood quickly, pushing past the line of passengers. The flight attendant who'd given her water caught her eye and smiled. ""Good luck out there,"" he said quietly.
Celestina smirked. ""Luck's overrated.""
She stepped off the plane and into the terminal. The air smelled different-coffee, pretzels, and something electric. The noise hit her like a wave, voices, announcements, footsteps. She tightened her grip on her bag and walked faster, blending into the crowd.
For the first time in a long time, no one knew her name. No one cared where she came from.
And for now, that was enough.
New York hit her like a punch. The noise, the lights, the smell of hot dogs and exhaust-it was chaos, and for the first time in a long time, she felt invisible. She wandered through the city, clutching her bag, her shoes slapping against the pavement.
She walked for hours, through streets that glowed with neon and rain. She passed people laughing, arguing, living. She passed a man playing saxophone under a bridge, the sound echoing like a heartbeat. She passed a woman selling pretzels who smiled at her, and for a second, Celestina almost smiled back.
But the ache in her chest didn't fade.
By midnight, she found herself in a small pharmacy, fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The shelves were lined with neat rows of painkillers, all promising relief in tidy white bottles. Her hands trembled as she reached for one.
Maybe this time she could finish what she started.
""Hey!"" The cashier's voice snapped her out of it. A guy in his twenties, wearing a name tag that said Eli, was staring at her. ""You gonna pay for that?""
Celestina froze. ""Uh... no?""
He sighed, pressing a button under the counter. ""Figures.""
The sirens came fast. She didn't fight when the officers cuffed her. She just laughed-a small, broken sound that made one of them glance at her with pity.
""Second time this week,"" she said, voice shaking. ""Think I get a punch card or something? Ten arrests and I win a free smoothie?""
The officer didn't answer.
As the car pulled away, Celestina leaned her head against the window again. The city lights blurred into streaks of gold and red. Somewhere deep down, she wondered if maybe this was all she'd ever be-running, breaking, surviving by accident.
And for the first time, she wasn't sure if she wanted to stop.
Outside, the rain began to fall, soft and relentless, washing the city clean. But no matter how hard it poured, it couldn't wash her away. Not yet.

The police station in lower Manhattan smelled like burnt coffee, wet coats, and bad decisions. I sat in a metal chair, arms crossed, hoodie sleeves pulled down over my hands. The cuffs were gone, but the red marks on my wrists still burned. The fluorescent lights above buzzed like angry bees, flickering every few seconds.
Across from me sat two officers, one older, gray at the temples, the other young and nervous, his badge still too shiny.
""Name?"" the older one asked.
I stared at the wall.
""Age?""
Silence.
""Where are your parents?""
I smirked. ""Dead. Probably rolling in their graves right now.""
The younger one shifted in his seat. ""Look, kid, we're not trying to make this hard. You were caught stealing medication. We just need to know who to call.""
I leaned back, the chair creaking. ""No one. There's no one left.""
The older one sighed, rubbing his forehead. ""Then we'll have to do this the hard way.""
They took me to a small white room that smelled like antiseptic. A nurse came in, gloves snapping, holding a syringe.
I raised an eyebrow. ""What's that for? Planning to clone me?""
""DNA identification,"" she said flatly. ""We'll run it through the system. If you've got any living relatives, we'll find them.""
I rolled up my sleeve. ""Good luck with that. The only one left is my uncle in Mississippi, and he probably thinks I'm dead.""
The needle pricked my arm, quick and cold. I watched the vial fill with dark red, then looked away.
Hours passed. I sat in the waiting area, tapping my foot, scrolling through my cracked phone. The battery was at 3%, the screen spiderwebbed with cracks. I didn't care. I just needed something to look at that wasn't another cop.
When the door finally opened, the older officer stepped out, holding a file. His expression was unreadable.
""Celestina,"" he said slowly, ""we got a match.""
I looked up, bored. ""Told you. Mississippi.""
He shook his head. ""No. Here. New York.""
My stomach dropped. ""That's impossible.""
He handed me the paper. ""You've got a biological brother. Older. Name's Lorenzo Cattaneo.""
I blinked, keeping my face blank, but inside my chest something twisted. I knew that name. I'd found it four years ago, written in my mother's handwriting on a stack of old letters I'd discovered while cleaning out my childhood home. Letters addressed to Lorenzo, Nico, Giovanni, Rocco and Elio Cattaneo. Letters that had never been sent.
I'd read every one of them. My mother's words had been desperate, pleading, full of love and fear. She'd begged them to answer, to help, to remember her. None of them ever had.
I'd planned to go to my uncle when I landed in New York. He was the only one who'd ever known I existed, though he'd made it clear he wanted nothing to do with my family. I didn't know why, only that he'd refused to take me in after my parents died.
Now, apparently, I had brothers I'd never met.
I forced a shrug. ""Never heard of him."" I lied
""He's been living here for years. Owns... several businesses."" The officer hesitated, lowering his voice. ""You might want to be careful around him.""
I frowned. ""Why?""
He didn't answer.
They called him. The conversation was short, tense. I could only hear one side of it, but the officer's tone said enough.
""Yes, sir. We verified the DNA twice... No, sir, this isn't a prank... Yes, she's here.""
When he hung up, he looked at me. ""He's sending someone to pick you up.""
My stomach twisted. ""He's actually coming?""
""Not personally. A driver.""
I laughed, sharp and humorless. ""Of course. Can't have the great Lorenzo Cattaneo showing up at a police station. Wouldn't want to ruin his reputation."" I muttered
The younger officer's eyes flicked up. ""You know who he is?""
""I know enough.""
When he left the room, I stood, pacing. My heart pounded. I didn't want this. I didn't want them. I wanted to disappear again.
So I ran.
I slipped out through the side door, ducking past a janitor, sprinting down the alley behind the station. The cold air burned my lungs, but I didn't stop. I turned a corner, then another, my sneakers slapping against wet pavement.
I made it two blocks before a voice shouted, ""Stop!""
A hand grabbed my arm, spinning me around. It was the younger officer from earlier, panting. ""You really thought you could outrun me?""
I glared. ""Worth a shot.""
He sighed, tightening his grip. ""Your ride's here.""
A black car waited at the curb, sleek and silent. The windows were tinted so dark I couldn't see inside. The driver stepped out-a tall man in a suit, expression blank.
""Miss Cattaneo?"" he asked.
I snapped ""Don't call me that.""
He opened the door. ""Your brother is expecting you.""
The ride was silent. The city blurred past in streaks of gray and gold. I sat stiffly, clutching my bag, my fingers brushing against the teddy bear inside.
When the car turned off the main road, the streets grew quieter. The buildings taller. We passed through iron gates that creaked open automatically, revealing a mansion that looked more like a fortress.
The driver parked in front of marble steps and opened my door. ""Welcome home.""
I stepped out, staring up at the house. It was massive-stone walls, black windows, ivy crawling up the sides. The kind of place that screamed money and secrets.
The front door opened before I could knock. A man stood there, tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in black. His eyes were sharp, cold, and far too familiar.
""Lorenzo Cattaneo,"" I said quietly.
He didn't smile. ""So you're the girl claiming to be my sister.""
""Not claiming,"" I said. ""Proven.""
He studied me, his gaze hard. ""DNA can be faked. People lie. Especially spies.""
I raised an eyebrow. ""You think I'm a spy? What am I, sixteen and working for the FBI? Please. I can barely afford a MetroCard.""
He didn't answer. He turned and walked inside. ""Follow me.""
The mansion was silent except for the echo of our footsteps. The walls were lined with paintings and photographs-none of them recent. Everything smelled faintly of smoke and expensive cologne.
I followed him through a long hallway, my jaw tight. I'd imagined this moment before-meeting him, confronting him-but not like this. Not as a stray dragged in by cops.
He led me up a grand staircase and stopped at a door. ""This will be your room. Stay here until I decide what to do with you.""
I crossed my arms. ""Wow. You really know how to make a girl feel welcome. Do you practice that tone in the mirror, or does it just come naturally?""
He didn't respond. The door shut behind him with a heavy click.
The room was huge-bigger than any I'd ever had-but it felt cold. The bed was perfectly made, the curtains drawn tight. I dropped my bag on the floor and sat on the edge of the bed, pulling out my phone.
No signal,of course.
I scrolled through old photos anyway-my brother, my sister, my mum, my dad .My chest ached.
Two hours passed. The silence pressed in on me. I was about to lie down when a soft knock came at the door.
A maid peeked in, smiling nervously. ""Miss Celestina? Dinner is ready. Mr. Cattaneo requests your presence.""
I sighed. ""Guess I'm meeting the rest of the family. Can't wait.""
The maid led me down a long hallway to a dining room that looked like it belonged in a movie. A chandelier hung overhead, casting golden light across a table big enough for twenty people.
Five men sat around it.
Lorenzo at the head, silent and unreadable. To his right, a man with dark hair and a scar across his jaw. To his left , a blond with a lazy grin that didn't reach his eyes. Then two identical boys with dirty blonde hair.
I stopped in the doorway. ""So this is the welcoming committee? You guys look thrilled.""
Lorenzo gestured to the empty chair. ""Sit.""
I did, slowly. The air was thick with tension.
The blond leaned forward, smirking. ""So you're the lost sister, huh? Thought you'd be taller.""
I shot him a look. ""Thought you'd be smarter.""
The scarred one chuckled under his breath. ""She's got a mouth.""
""Yeah,"" I said, stabbing a piece of steak with my fork. ""It's called personality. You should try it sometime.""
The blond laughed. ""I like her.""
Lorenzo's voice cut through the noise. ""Enough."" He turned to me. ""You'll stay here until I'm certain of who you are. You'll follow the rules. You'll stay out of my business. Understood?""
I met his gaze, unflinching. ""Crystal. Anything else, boss? Should I curtsy too?""
The scarred one smirked. ""She's got fire.""
Lorenzo's eyes flicked to me, cold and assessing. ""We'll see.""
Dinner dragged on forever. The food was perfect, steak, potatoes, wine, but I barely touched it. I could feel their eyes on me, weighing me, judging me.
I kept my face blank, but inside, anger burned. Not just at them-but at the man who'd made them. My father. The man who'd divorced my mother the moment he found out she was pregnant with a girl. The man who'd tried to have her killed to erase the ""mistake.""
My brothers didn't know what kind of man their father was I mean it's obvious ,They'd grown up rich, safe, loved, while my mother and I hid, running from the man who'd sworn to destroy us.
And now they sat here, pretending to be surprised I existed.
When dinner ended, Lorenzo stood. ""Marta,"" he said, his voice low but firm, ""take her to my office.""
I raised an eyebrow. ""Wow, already? Didn't think we were at the 'family meeting' stage yet.""
Lorenzo's expression didn't change. ""Now.""
I leaned back in my chair, smirking. ""Fine. But if this is where you tell me I'm secretly adopted or part of a cult, I'm walking out.""
One of the twins snorted. ""You've got guts, kid.""
I stood, brushing imaginary dust off my jeans. ""No. I've got nothing left to lose.""
And with that, I followed Marta down the hall, my heart pounding, my mind racing.
Whatever waited for me in that office, I knew one thing for sure-

1p76wwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tools/comments/1p76wwm/how_does_brother_pt_d210_detect_the_tape/,How does Brother PT D210 detect the tape?,"I own a Brother P-Touch D210 label maker. Its back plate states that it accepts 3.5 – 12 mm TZe tapes.

Recently I wanted to label the wiring in a coffee maker, so I searched a little bit and found out that there are actually TZe heat shrink cassettes of different sizes! I think the 5.8 mm is the right size for my wires, but I also got a 8.8 mm version. These are third party, not the original Brother cassettes, but I never had a problem with non-original consumables. There is not a lot of info on the packaging, only this:

* 5.8 mm, black on white: HSc-211, BYZ TUBE
* 8.8 mm, black on white: HSc-221, BYZ TUBE
* 5.8 mm, black on yellow: HSc-611, BYZ TUBE
* 8.8 mm, black on yellow: HSc-621, BYZ TUBE

Now, the problem is that the printer does not detect the 5.8 mm cassettes, although this size falls into the supported range. Neither it calculates a label length in the lower right corner of the screen (it does so when a supported cassette is inserted), nor it initiates a print. Only says ""🛈 No Cassette!"" when hitting the print button. 8.8 mm works fine, though.

I tried to reduce the height of the font to the minimum, in hope that the printer just checks that. No luck.

I tried to find information on how this printer detects a cassette in general. Some sources say that there are 6 spring loaded pins (sensors) that detect the holes at one of the corners of a cassette. Indeed, the pattern of the holes is different between both sizes. Regular 12 mm laminated tape has another, different pattern too. However, those sources are probably about more advanced printers, because mine does not have 6 pins. Instead, it has only one in that corner, and it's definitely not spring loaded, probably just a protection against inserting a wrong cassette. Other than that, all the cassettes are very similar. I even tried to drill additional holes in the 5.8 mm cassettes to mimic the 8.8 mm one, but that didn't help.

I doubt the cassettes have any RFID or even electronics in them, I remember disassembling one when I first got the printer and it's plain mechanics.

I also tried to put a piece of tape crossing the print head, hoping that there is some sort of an optical sensor that checks the width there, but again, no luck.

So, I guess, there is another mechanism? Out of curiosity, understanding potential dangers, I want to know if that's possible to start a print with the smaller heat shrink tube?

Thank you!

In the beginning I was playing several machines betting between $1.50 to $5.88 trying to hit something good on the mostly new slots. But there was no luck it was up and down not winning or losing. Then I decided to take a coffee break with my uncle for a short while at the food court chatting about playing the slot machines and other things. Then around evening I decided to try my luck again I was jumping between machines trying to hit something good then I can leave the casino for good. At approximately 7:30pm I came across Dancing Drums Power Trio playing at $2.88 trying to get a bonus round after a few spins the pot started to open.

I am pretty new to frags this year and extra new to indie frags but they are all that I’m purchasing moving forward. 🤣 I want to focus on non toxic (phthalate free) and not using stock oils, so I know there are plenty of options! 

I like sweet (love honey!) and fruity smells best (especially sweet fruity like fruity dessert scents), coffee, some light florals. 
I can’t handle incense, patchouli, sandalwood, spicy (ginger especially), too green, herbal, or aquatic. I’m a basic b* I guess. Got a simple nose like my child. 😅

My skin is like a sponge, so things tend to disappear QUICK! But I found Sorce and have been obsessed with the longevity and many of the scents! 

My favorites (so far) are The Bees and IDAFT passionfruit and blueberry. I also like f*ckery, falling stars, moon magic, serpentine, a witch’s valentine, I think about you too, strings of light, light through the clouds, and I have a bunch of bottles coming. 🙈

I have enjoyed Hexennacht morphine and honeycomb calcite, and Solstice sun warmed honey but I haven’t tried much else. Not indie but I LOVE the plum vanilla in Noyz Unmute. 

Got any suggestions for houses and/or specific scents?? 🥰🤞🙌 next month is my birthday month and then January starts a no buy, so I’m looking now. 
Would especially love any BF sales! Hahaha

I've been smoking for many years and bloody love it - but I can't deny the fact that it's not the healthiest thing you can do for your body. So I took a couple of days without smoking and it's been pretty fucking tough. Last night I watched The Mike Nolan Show before going to bed.   
  
In my dreams I sat outside my house, at my usual smoking spot, with a cup of coffee not smoking. All of a sudden Mike Nolan came around the corner in his hi-vis gear, with a beer and doobskin. I greeted him like I'd known him for years and he sat down next to me. ""Wanna smoke on this?"" I said no, I gave up smoking weed years ago. ""You'll miss out on the good things in life cunt"". Then he swang out a pack of ciggies, in a fantastic motion, where one cigarette popped up - it was truly beautiful. ""Want one of these then?"" Of course it was Winnie Blues. I said no thanks, I gave up smoking a couple of days ago. ""Why? Smoking is fucking sick"" I've been smoking for to long and it's not healthy for you. ""I've been smoking since I was 4 and been doing hard tradesman work since I was in grade 2 - nothing stopping me"". I could see his point, but I said that I truly enjoyed it, but a little break from the ciggies would be good for me. ""Why give up something you love? I would never quit something that I love. Think about it cunt, think about it. What will people say? He died doing what he loved, just like these crazy extreme sport cunts. Have a smoke cunt, come on"". I thought what the hell, and took a smoke and it tasted wonderful - and Mike gave me a beer to go with it, ofc a triple X bronze. I told him that it was the best ciggie and beer I had my entire life, and that I would never quit. He looked at me and said ""Yearh yearh yearh man - fuck ‘em"". 

When I woke up I almost laughed remembering the silly dream. Made a cup of coffee, rolled a ciggie and went out a smoke - and it was truly amazing, never giving up the ciggies. Thank you for the words of advice Mike Nolan!",7,1764161278.0,TheBigLezShow,2,0.89,False

And are so good at lying and bending/omitting information?
I'll try to keep the background as brief as I can but this is what has happened:

-5 weeks ago we had my (me F45) partners (F47) school reunion. It was at the place she had only just resigned from but she was about to start working at another place 3 doors up. She works in hospo, late nights etc She became good friends with a few of the girls from the old place, one in particular we'll call SK. The night of the reunion, something was off but I couldn't put my finger on it. She was distant (has been since) and didn't bat an eyelid, nor come to my rescue when I got bailed up by a guy who chewed my ear off for the better part of 20 minutes while she was less than 2 metres away. 

- the following Saturday night, I get a text from her 15 minutes before she's supposed to finish (8pm) saying she's going to pop in to old place to catch up quickly with one of the girls (not SK). This is fine. 9pm I get a message from another girl who works there saying my partners phone battery has gone flat and she's charging it. 11pm I get a text from my partner saying her battery had gone flat, she was charging her phone, they're going to pop into the place on the corner for a little bit and she was going to turn her phone off again now to keep charging it. 4.37am she comes flapping into the bedroom, wakes me up wanting to know where my car keys are because her car is behind mine with a flat battery and she can't put the windows up. I sit outside for a minute or two while she's deciding to call RACV. Over her shoulder, I see she's messaging SK. Now I'm pissed and ask where the hell she's been for the last 5 hours. And who with? Reply was ""no-one, everyone""
That's how it started. To keep a long story short, over the last few weeks I've managed to get into her messenger, they message regularly but there's nothing in the messages, other than my partner explaining that she opened up to her (SK), about our relationship because she trusts her and thinks they're very similar. Replies from SK were all team me and my partner. 
I asked her outright is there anything she needs to tell me, she assured me no. I asked outright about SK, she said no. I explained that I feel like she's gone, like she's not here. 
We came good for about a week but there were too many little things eating at me: a random shell turning up in the centre console in the car (her reason was she had to use it as an ashtray, yet it had no ash on it.) A takeaway coffe cup in her car; she doesn't drink coffee. She had the locations turned off on her ipad, iphone and watch for about a week in Find My. Gave a different excuse to both me and her stepmum about why.
It blew this weekend again because she told me she'd been talking to SK about what we should get my son for Christmas because her daughter is the same age. I said why wouldn't you speak to me about that. Then she wanted to ask her over to our house for drinks that night.
I asked to borrow her phone, saying mine was flat and went through every messaging app, messages and calls. No conversation or call history with SK. When I know there has been. So she's deleted it. I fully accused her then. I made her let me put her phone through a data recovery program but because nothing gets backed up because the storage is full, I couldn't find anything. 
Her reaction is what got me the most. She was cool, calm and collected until she started getting pissedoff while I was sobbing hysterically. She told me that me not trusting her was a me problem, not hers. She told me to ring SK and ask her myself. She told me all the things they talk about, health, family, relationships, yet where are these messages of great conversations?
I told her she was doing absolutely nothing to comfort or reassure me and if the situation was reversed, I'd be jumping through hoops to prove it wasn't true. It was like she could care less. I said can't you see what this is doing to me? She said she's not doing anything, that I've got all these little ideas in my head and I said she shouldn't be doing the things that are making me feel this way.

She also told me that they only talk on messenger, which she doesn't know I've been checking regularly. But they don't, they also talk on WhatsApp, Insta and Snapchat. There was a reel that SK had sent to my partner in Insta that she had then deleted that was from ""love.quotes.""I showed my partner and she said she never even saw it, that obviously SK had sent ot to the wrong person hence why she'd deleted it. This is what I mean by excuses/reasons for everything. I said to her why tell me you only talk on messenger when there's also 3 other platforms? And if you say you've only just recently added her phone number and that you text her a couple if days ago, where's the history gone? She said her phone had a meltdown the other day, she lost half her messages but it would seem SK is the only one affected.

Her phone doesn't leave her side, she's constantly on it and whenever I go near here, she'll jump out of whatever she's in and go back to the home screen. I bought this up as well, she said she was talking to the other girls in a group chat from the old place. The next reason was that it was always work stuff and she's goes out of it so that I don't think she's always on her phone. Reasons/excuses excuses/reasons.",1,1764161131.0,Infidelity,5,1.0,False

I’ve been on many diets before but reckon I may have cracked it now with a good diet. I was roughly 3 months ago 120kg but now down to 99.4kg. For those looking for ideas or tips I did the following: 

- drink a morning coffee
- fast till mid afternoon (water allowed)
- mid afternoon eat 4 boiled eggs with ginger tea 
- fast till the evening 
- have another black coffee
- evening time around 6-ish eat my final meal consisting of masala chicken steak, veggies and hot sauce 

I always make sure to log my meals in a diary and maybe 3-4 times a week I do running on the treadmill, it’s done my confidence a lot of good, energy levels are up and I’m down from a size 42 Jean size to 36 Jean size, from XL shirt to a L. I’m gonna keep going until I reach my target of 80kg with a max limit of 77kg. 

Key takeaways 

- no fruit
- no junk food 
- grilled meats 👍
- boiled eggs
- little to no carbs 
- intermittent fasting 
- giving about 40-50 mins of exercise a few times a week

1p76rl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1p76rl1/i_love_my_husband/,I love my husband,"As the title says, I love my husband. 

We’ve been together since my sophomore year of high school and we’re each turning 30 with in the next 7 months. 

I still get butterflies in my stomach thinking about being held by him and being told that he loves me. 

He is the most supportive man, probably one of the most supportive men in the world. I’m diagnosed with personality disorders and PTSD, and on our relationship have had times where I’m medicated and times where I’m not medicated. 

The times where I’m not medicated; I would cry for nearly no reason, think of SH, and “unaliving.” (Sorry if that word makes some people upset, it’s hard for me to type or say the actual word with my history) I’ve said mean things that I would never truly mean, and these things I still feel guilty for. 

No matter what he was there to hold me and care for me. We would have long open conversations about what I’ve said and done, and how it affects us and how to move on in the future. 

I just want to always hold his hand, I want to always be near him if possible. I want to help his dreams come true, and I want to support him through everything. 

He has a pretty good career, he’s worked so hard to get where he is today. I always tell him how much I appreciate him for his hard work, and how impressed I am that we’ve made it this far in life from eating struggle meals living paycheck to paycheck. 

Where ever I mention this he always says, I just want to take care of us and make sure we’re stable and have everything we want. 

He just makes me want to be the best person I can be. I want fight tooth and nail for life now. I can’t imagine leaving what we’ve built behind. He makes me happy to be alive. 

He is also the funniest person I have ever met. He’s reactions are amazing, he does incredibly silly things, and sometimes he jokingly pokes fun at me and all I can do it laugh. 

He just bought the Coca-Cola cups they have at some Mexican restaurants, and I snagged a picture of his face opening the box. His genuine reaction is the funniest thing I’ve seen because the face he makes is one of the happiest smiles I have ever seen on any human.

What brought me to want to tell everyone about how much I love my husband? 

I’m so constipated, I haven’t had a good shit in almost a week now. I’m so bloated I look pregnant, and it physically hurts to move around and bend over. What does he do? Comes up with whacky solutions. The most recent attempt was “blue collar workers always have to shit 30 minutes to an hour after their morning cigarette and caffeine. We have to wake up at 6 in the morning, you have to smoke a cigarette and chug a monster within 5 minutes. Then pretend you’re doing manual labor. Then you’ll have to shit.” 

Fuck it I’m on board. The cigarette was disgusting, don’t know how I used to chain smoke those. The monster was the new-ish strawberry one. That was really good though. He just left for work not too long ago, and I haven’t shit just yet but I’m hopeful. (I’ve been having two capfuls of MiraLAX in my coffee for days, and having high fiber foods. I’m trying over here)

After I did that, he stayed with me in bathroom while I showered, took my clothes I was wearing and put them in the wash, and got a new outfit out for me to wear. He then took the pack away and said he’s gonna hide it to make sure if I get any urges from this, I wouldn’t find them. He calls them medicinal now. I guess they’re shitting cigarettes. 

He just always goes the extra mile, the effort he puts in is astounding. I love him so much.

Eikö teidän mielestänne olisi juuri tällähetkellä täydellistä PR-politiikkaa sijoittaa yritysten tekemät voitot joulubonuksien sijaan esimerkiksi uusien vakituisten työntekijöiden palkkaukseen?

Uskoisin ainakin jo omastakin työkokemuksistani, että monessa muussakin suomalaisen yritysten tiimeissä on tällä hetkellä meneillään kunnon burn-out työmäärä yhdelle-kahdelle ihmiselle.

Täällä työttömänä olisi nyt tällähetkellä n. hieman yli 10% Suomen kansasta, joista suurin osa minut mukaanlukien olisi erittäin motivoituneita tulemaan sinne teidän työmaalle apuun!

Pyytäkää nyt siis hyvät ihmiset teidän yläpuoleltanne apua työmääräänne. Tai kysykää yhteisissä HR coffee meeting palavereissanne onko rekrytointia suunnitteilla lähitulevaisuudessa.

En näkisi tällähetkellä paljon parempaa julkikuvan parannusta omalle yritykselle, kuin sen että rekry sivuilta löytyisi tähän työllisyystilanteeseen paikkoja avoimena.

Voitaisiinko nyt yhdessä luoda yrityksiimme hieman painetta avaamaan lisää työpaikkoja? Ärsyttää monella varmasti tässä Suomen tilanteessa tarkistella oman johtoportaan palkkoja verotiedoista, samalla tietäen työkavereita jotka ovat hirveässä ahdingossa resursseissa työmäärään nähden.

Pientä painetta nyt sinne työnantajien suuntaan siis tässä vaiheessa, vai onko sinun mielestä perusteltua ettei yrityksellänne todennäköisesti ole yhtään paikkaa avoimena tällähetkellä?

Mostly due a deeply ingrained fear of repercussions if anyone “found out” about my family. Instilled by a manipulative sadistic, arrogant, pretentious father and backed up by a bystander of a mother who wants the easy path and pretends nothing is wrong. My sister manifested beliefs based on her upbringing which aligned with my father’s ideals, and impacted me negatively in my formative years.  This is my story of how I climbed out the toxic pit of my family. 

For years I believed it was all me. The annoying one, the attention seeker, the people pleaser. Teachers pet. Clumsy. Socially inept. Stupid and disappointing. For years I kept telling myself I wasn’t good enough, frequent changes in relationships and interests. When I met my current partner, things all changed. Things kicked off really quick with us. We went and booked a 2 week holiday after knowing each other for a week. I moved in with her after 4 months. For the first time I genuinely felt I was in the right place and found the right human for me. We loved each other very quickly and still do to this day :) that I cannot be more grateful for. However, things started to change with my family at the same time. 

My dad (who I worked with at the same office) started having an affair with someone my age at work (Diane) and did little to hide it. 
My dad would say don’t tell my mum, my mum asked what is he doing. 
My mum knew the affair was happening, kept asking what I should do over dinners out crying and despondent. Next day she carries on like nothing happened. When they did eventually get round to having an adult conversation rather than use me as a conduit, they then told me to “get over it” when I had feelings on the matter. It was so unbearable seeing it happening and being dragged into it, learning he paid for Diane’s fertility treatment, bought her clothes and expensive jewellery, getting her a promotion when he knew I was waiting for an opening, they went to the gym together, met on weekends for lunch and evenings. I caught him looking at her with lustful eyes at a work social once. Waited for him to notice which took a minute, I just wanted to see him after a “gotcha” moment. Didn’t even register I was thinking that despite calling it out so many times and he denied it every time. When I first started at his office, he texted me saying “you must never tell anyone at work about me and my life”. I always took that as respecting a private persons needs, but the sinister reality of what came to pass made me feel played. Work colleagues noticed, they kept asking if I’m “really” ok. I often got visits from his team at my desk to take me to coffee, talk about things other than work and my dad. They were disapproving of him in their demeanour, and sympathetic toward me. They often stepped in to “protect” me and support me on tricky work matters. They were a great bunch and wish there were more folks like them.

Once I found out they were training together at the gym one weekend and I got in a wild argument with my partner on something unrelated but it escalated because of my learned situation. I was renovating my flat at the time so I went there to cool off and do some work. Long story short I was in A&E the next day for surgery because I’d severed 4 tendons in my wrist doing a hammer punch on a porcelain tile for a failed score and snap. He didn’t visit me in hospital or check if I was ok. I nicked the artery and was VERY lucky to be alive. In the chaos I managed to get my neighbour to walk me to the pharmacy across the road. Bless the staff they were not ready for the gore factor that walked in that day. I gave them my parents numbers mobile and home. They left messages. I learned later on there was no answer or attempt to call me back after asking them both what happened when they received the calls. They said they thought it was spam and ignored it”. I was a bodybuilder at the time, being out of action for 6 months including no driving destroyed what little self worth I had. It was that moment I decided to make my partner my emergency contact instead. 

My dad would get really hostile if I brought Diane up demanding his rationale, what he’s doing to the family running around with her in “secret”. Like a feral animal he snarled at me with a curled lip, along the lines of “none of your business” or “do NOT talk to me about that” with rage in his voice. I then tried all sorts of ways to rekindle a relationship with him, realising full frontal strategy wasn’t working. I tried exploring investing strategies with him. He gave me a stupid amount of money to invest, saying “don’t worry i can afford to lose it”, but the moment a big loss was made he was livid and spitting with rage. I made him wooden gifts like a draw insert to organise his many belts (which he loved, but soon fizzled interest, deepening his relationship in the affair). 

At this point I had enough, I was losing my partner and chose to move hundreds of miles away, new job different life. Essentially a new start. My sister had no concept of how hard this was for me, kept saying it’s not your problem get on with your life. 
She handled the situation differently and we clashed on it. She became really abrasive and wasn’t interested in my calls for support. She did cry on the phone to me to NEVER DO THAT AGAIN with my DIY accident, but never asked how I was recovering. Just straight back to abrasive short disgruntled interactions. Often judging. 
I got so fed up and exasperated after trying to get the family together to reconcile, talk about where our head is at and how we can all support one another to come out the other side of this. She said it was stupid, overthinking it, never doing that, clearly wants to be the golden boy.
I exploded at my sister, calling her rotten to the core and never to speak to me again, with many expletives about how I felt about her. We grew a rift for 2 years. Didn’t engage in conversation with her at a wedding having to share the same table. Pretended she wasn’t there. Not the most mature of me, it was all I knew how to cope. 
Lockdown happened and felt there was more important matters than our feud. I changed direction and knocked on her door unannounced to say let’s put our differences aside and work together to be a family again. I moved back to my home region and started a new job with my family somewhat back in my life. I didn’t want to apologise to my sister because those feelings were still there, and I’m glad I didn’t apologise based on what happened years later.
 
Let’s come back to my dad: when I tried offering to do a day out on Father’s Day to a motor museum, look at cars that we both have an interest in. I called him when he was on holiday not realising they had gone away. He sounded disgruntled and disturbed from sunbathing but his response: “why on EARTH would I do that?” Like really disgusted and like I urinated on his strawberries. My dad had hurt me before physically and emotionally but this time really hit different. I think for all the effort prior felt like a total waste of time. 

Nothing got through to him, or he really wasn’t interested anymore.

As a person, his version of love was money and image. If you were earning a wage he deemed worthy and in an approved industry, and you were in great shape, then you were rewarded with his attention. Hence why I did bodybuilding. To gain his approval. Instead he saw it as competition and started studying human biology, how telemeres extend your life expectancy kind of detail. I wasn’t on that level but he verbally force fed everything he read. My partner is a doctor and she challenged his views asking where he got his info from, a lot of it turned out to be pseudo-science. She never got respect from them for that. I went to university to study a design course. He didn’t believe in it, said it was a waste of time despite my creative talents. Because it wasn’t his industry, or it wasn’t the stock markets, he switched off from it. Never once did he show interest in my studies. Only showed up to the graduation wanting to go before the ceremony even started.

Going to university triggered the golden boy insecurity in my sister. Said my parents paid for everything like I was a VIP. In reality: I have my student loan to my parents to manage my finances and drip feed me when I needed it for study. I went and got a job at uni to pay for my fun time.
The whole golden boy concept annoyed me so much because I just did what I was told and got rewarded for keeping quiet, working hard and trying to stay “healthy”. Eg I was petrified of my dad for shouting at me in spitting rage and disapproval. I would always tell myself I’m not good enough and need to do more, even now. They rewarded this with things of monetary value the more I did it the higher the value got. One day however during a bad spell of shouting every evening and weekend and hiding in my room, I got bad grades at school. I was grounded for 3 months and had my PlayStation taken off me. Connect the dots, home life was affecting me causing the poor grades. 
He got me into mountain bike racing at a young age, would get me up at 7:30am on Saturdays to practice, often I would want to stay in because he intimidated me and rode off in anger and disappointment. He would seldom check I was ok on a ride. I was on “his” time, it was inconvenient to check in and always wanted to beat his previous track time. I hurt myself a good few times and it took him 10 minutes to come back while I lay on the floor in pain. He helped in those moments though (eventually), but was made to look bad when passers by were confused where he was. That made him angry and snippy at me if I wasn’t performing on the bike to his liking.

Revisiting my mum, she would often say how she misses our conversations when I moved out, but I would often not say anything because she never listened to me. She often spoke in a finite way that was a statement and about “the neighbours bought a new car” or “it rained on Tuesday”. Not a reciprocal conversation. I tried for years to say “ok, what do you want me to do with that information” encouraging some social dynamics. It happened over and over and I started to lose interest in her “conversations” very quick. She never asked about me, I would often probe her on things like “what’s new?” “How are the dogs?” “Have you been anywhere nice” it was just sentences that led to nothing. My dad cut her off from the world with his mantra of not trusting anyone until they prove themselves. He didn’t seem to like her socialising with anyone.. probably in fear of finding out who he really was. I couldn’t understand why she “enjoyed our conversations” if they were incredibly painful, nothing positive, always glum, like listening to a half baked news report from a disinterested reader.  So many times I told her to stop texting me everyday “morning xx” and “night xx” because it felt like I needed to check in on a punch card. She didn’t listen kept doing the same thing. I tried encouraging her to get into one of her hobbies, like floral arrangements, she said she’s not good enough (even saying “you get better with practice, plus you get to make friends along the way”, still didn’t land). At some point, you have to help yourself. This went on for years before I met my current partner. I get that her way of expressing love is through being present, but it was always one way, without thinking of the recipients needs. My dad was clearly not providing those needs for a very long time. 

She played the fool with me often in family settings like a silly sibling, but I’d often say “stop” and she would carry on anyway, which almost always escalated to me getting upset and saying “STOP! How many more times?!” And she would be all sad and forlorn. I say this knowing it makes me sound bad, but she would feed on knowing I felt guilty about it. Because I’d apologise and her mood instantly changed, back to annoying me and difficult vapid conversation. 

I did so much to try and help support her, but in time it became apparent I fell in the role of the husband she never had. She craved something my dad failed to give. 
As the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water. But this was too much for me alone. 

My sister had little desire to help having her own issues to contend with. She claimed my dad “looked” at her one day while getting changed and felt vulnerable from then on. She had the rival sibling in me that she believed was the golden boy, but in reality my parents gave her everything she wanted just to keep her quiet and to stop the protesting. For me I had to WORK for it, I would have to just “make it up” “put up with it” and “say sorry” even if I went to blame. I often found my individual needs (physically and emotionally) were squashed. I cared not for monetary compensation, I longed for emotional connection with my family. My dad knew how much I wanted to do a track day at Spa, he kept talking of his plans. Then one day I saw some pics of him and my sisters ex from the day he did without me. Apparently I was unavailable and at uni. He hadn’t mentioned it once, I was gaslit into believing I passed up the offer.

I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 years ago, after lengthy discussions with doctors and peers it was clear I had a disability from a young age which my parents did not get me help for. They spent a lot of money on themselves which if they couldn’t access the school support system could have sought private help. They brought in a tutor that just felt like an extra school day, I got decent grades, that I’m grateful for, but I needed guidance and for whatever reason they chose not to pursue it. My aunt worked in special educational care for children including autistic children and met with them frequently, my sister and I both present on those visits. They would most certainly had a conversation about my “quirks”. But never did it twig I might need support for my disability. My mum volunteered at my school but spent all her time with one boy who she praised the high heavens about. He had reading difficulties but she helped with his comprehension of texts and beamed about his achievements. She would often ask how he was doing, but never helped me with my challenges. My teachers often spoke with her about how I need to show my workings, need to do the work to show my understanding for extra marks. but nothing changed, I didn’t know how to do that. I was socially awkward and bullied often at school. Physically abused there and subsequently scared of school, then scared of going home to an angry dad who shouts the house down at my mum over things she could not control and sometimes punching a hole in a wall or door, blaming my mum for it. So much crying and little I could do to get away from it. Childhood traumas can exacerbate and complicate ADHD later in life too. So thanks for that, “parents”.

Fast forward to recent times, the final straw was how my parents treated my partners parents. I was already nervous of introducing them because of socio-economic differences. My parents always looked down their nose at anyone with less income than them. When they finally met after being with my partner for 5 years, they went and wrecked it and my Christmas. It nearly broke my partner and I up. My partner and I worked so hard to prepare them over years, explaining who they are and sharing experiences with them and their potential differences as people. We thought we had it.

During the affair, I had no other “grown ups” to talk to other than my partner so I confided in her parents too. I told my mum for transparency that I confided and felt trapped, which was met with anger and on reflection, probably embarrassment. 3 years on from me telling my mum that, and she used that as means to interrogate my partners mum. Then she called her fat. Said in no uncertain terms that her ideas were stupid for our house. My dad was just talking about himself and drinking away a bottle of red wine. I challenged my mum after what I learned she did absolutely mortified and she started pitting me up against her with falsehoods in conversation she apparently had with her. She was manipulating me to the point I went months feeling rage every day. It was at Christmas when we said we were having them over and she said “oh send them Christmas wishes from me, if that’s allowed”. That’s when I decided enough was enough. And that if she wants to talk to me again she needs to apologise for what she’s done. She still claims she doesn’t know what she did (even texts spelling it out in bullet points, she conveniently loses the texts or ignores them).

I took a giant step after much thought that it’s best I walk away from this toxic family. And I’m so glad I did. In my lowest moment, I was in despair to my sister about not wanting to exist anymore. I was on the phone with her and she said “can I .. call you back? Just got to my friends”. It’s been 15 months. Still no call back to check on me. I’ve also divulged to my parents of not wanting to exist anymore (in person, stood around their kitchen island full attention on me) their response was “ok”. I asked what they meant by that a week later, they say they didn’t know what to say.. but if you care that much about someone you would have so much to say..

Since getting engaged I figured it polite to let my parents know their son reached a significant milestone in his life with someone he wants to be with forever. my mother tried to sabotage my happiness once again by bringing up the past on the day I proposed to her. I was only texting my dad at this point, he relied “that’s great, but you should tell your mother”. After my ultimatum of apologise to me or we aren’t talking I stuck my heels in. He said how she’s been on at him for me not texting her, so I just saw that as a way out of his own doing.  I saw red and repeated back why we don’t speak anymore. 

A life without immediate family sucks. No other way around that. But then I see friends parents, the way they interact. I often engage with them at social gatherings and in a bittersweet sense imagine what a parent could be. I reflect on my journey of individualism and self discovery and really: as much as life continues to be challenging in personal battles of insecurity and low self esteem, I’m glad I made that choice and incredibly grateful having with my loving partner by my side every step of the way.

https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/s/qoJ2J28wXa


So… it’s been an interesting and emotionally brutal week, so here’s the update.


Last Thursday I found out that my now ex-fiancée was planning a “Dear John” exit. She cancelled her mail, signed a new lease, booked a moving company, and was planning to leave a handwritten letter and disappear without telling me, her family, or anyone.


Since then she’s been living in the spare room. I’ve never heard her this quiet in my life.


Friday:
I forced myself up for work. Showered, brushed my teeth, shoved a couple bites of food down, and left because sitting around the apartment was making me worse.
My coworkers knew right away something was off. I told them the basic outline and they gave me space to breathe and unload. Honestly their support kept me upright that day.


I called her mother and gave her a gentle version of what was happening. She understood more than I said. I cried to her for about an hour.
I called her only immediate relative, her uncle. He said we’d grab a coffee sometime soon.


Saturday was my birthday.
I refused to spend it in bed. I went to a friend’s place and talked all day. A couple people joined on speakerphone. It was actually healing to have friends back in my corner after years of isolation.


When I came home that night she was here, but you wouldn’t know it. No sound. She stayed in the spare room except to grab snacks, feed the cat, or go to the bathroom. I don’t think she showered. The anti-slip mat she hates was still lying on the floor of the tub instead of being hung up.


Sunday:
I didn’t leave the bed. Didn’t move until Monday morning when I had to get ready for work. That’s when I made my last post.


Later I emailed her a detailed message. Basically the whole timeline from my last post but softer, clearer, and much calmer. I told her I wasn’t asking her to fix anything or respond. I just needed to put in writing what I couldn’t get out properly during “the talk.”


Since then, I’m slowly stabilizing. Still struggling with sleep and eating. Nightmares, cold sweats, anxiety waves. But at least I can talk without breaking down constantly.


I think she called in sick for the week. She hasn’t left the spare room. Zero noise. Zero movement unless she absolutely has to.


Then came what I’m calling “The Bunny Incident.”


On the living room windowsill sits a matching pair of small plush bunnies with our names on them. A friend of mine gave them to us for Easter one year.


I was hurting. We weren’t talking. All I did was turn her bunny around. Nothing dramatic. Just picked it up, turned it around so it faced away. When I came home later it was still like that.


Tuesday morning she must have noticed. She moved a little more than usual. When I got up to get ready and make food for work, I noticed she had thrown her bunny into the garbage bin.


I have theories about why. Shame. Avoidance. Guilt. I’m not guessing though.


I took it out of the garbage, cleaned it off, and put it back where it originally sat next to mine. I wrote a little note:


“Just because I’m upset doesn’t mean you’re garbage. You’re human and not disposable. My hurt isn’t hate.”


When I got home that night, the bunny and the note were untouched.
But she definitely saw it. I had moved the scratching post a little so the note would be more noticeable. It was moved it back.


I also learned this week that I don’t have much of a poker face.
My job forces me to interact with people so I couldn’t hide.


I’m usually one of the most social people at work. Always smiling, always talking, always joking around. But that day I tried to give my usual “Hey how’s it going?” smile and apparently it was awful.


One coworker, someone I share more personal stuff with, stopped and asked again in a serious tone: “How are you actually doing?”


I sighed. “Is it that obvious?”


“How bad is it?”


“Nightmare level.”


Their face dropped. “Oh no.”


So I told them what I could remember. As structured as possible without breaking down. I could hear my own voice shake. My hands were shaky. I had to speak slower because I didn’t want to fall apart again.


They were furious. At her. Legitimately angry.
“What the absolute fuck is wrong with her?”
I’ve heard them swear before, but never with anger behind it.


Then they said, “She doesn’t fucking deserve you. I know what you’ve done for her and for her mom. You tell me your life like I tell you mine.”


Then they made me repeat:
“I deserve better.”
Over and over until I actually said it like I meant it.


We talked for half an hour...the time just went. They listened to every word and gave good advice...that usually involved: 


""She's a fucking cunt, and doesn't deserve you!"" 


""Where you actually happy?""


""Did you really want to spend your life living like this?"" 


They had an appointment and had to go, apologized for running off, and told me to find them anytime I needed to talk.


A few other people must have overheard because a lot of coworkers started speaking to me with a much softer tone for the rest of the day.


As for the moving plan:
Her original idea was to give me a “Dear John” letter Saturday morning, pack the apartment with the movers, and be gone by Monday morning.
When I got home last night, the empty moving totes were delivered. Looks like she moved the delivery date up.


My guess? She’s trying to avoid me as much as possible.


Last night I wrote her a letter and left it out for her to see. Basically telling her to take care of herself. My willingness to still take her mother out when she needs it. Groceries, pharmacy, doctors appointments. (Stroke survivor, little friends, mobility issues ..etc etc) My now ex doesn't have a driver's license, let alone a car. So it's very unfair to her mom. Also telling her of legalities, as her name was added to the rental agreement and that she had to give a 60 day notice, not a 1 or 2 day one like she wanted.

I did let them know when i went back and purchased the expresso in the latte, that the coffee tasted like an entire cup of expresso and not even the blond expresso, tasted like the signature expresso… and then in the latte, couldn’t even taste the espresso like usual.

Also. Should i let them know the latte tasted more like a smooth cup of coffee?

1p76iqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarRelationships/comments/1p76iqp/how_do_you_know_if_theyre_cheating/,How do you know if they're cheating?,"How are you able to work out what is the truth when they have a reason/excuse for everything that happens? And are so good at lying and bending/omitting information?
I'll try to keep the background as brief as I can but this is what has happened:

-5 weeks ago we had my (me F45) partners (F47) school reunion. It was at the place she had only just resigned from but she was about to start working at another place 3 doors up. She works in hospo, late nights etc She became good friends with a few of the girls from the old place, one in particular we'll call SK. The night of the reunion, something was off but I couldn't put my finger on it. She was distant (has been since) and didn't bat an eyelid, nor come to my rescue when I got bailed up by a guy who chewed my ear off for the better part of 20 minutes while she was less than 2 metres away. 

- the following Saturday night, I get a text from her 15 minutes before she's supposed to finish (8pm) saying she's going to pop in to old place to catch up quickly with one of the girls (not SK). This is fine. 9pm I get a message from another girl who works there saying my partners phone battery has gone flat and she's charging it. 11pm I get a text from my partner saying her battery had gone flat, she was charging her phone, they're going to pop into the place on the corner for a little bit and she was going to turn her phone off again now to keep charging it. 4.37am she comes flapping into the bedroom, wakes me up wanting to know where my car keys are because her car is behind mine with a flat battery and she can't put the windows up. I sit outside for a minute or two while she's deciding to call RACV. Over her shoulder, I see she's messaging SK. Now I'm pissed and ask where the hell she's been for the last 5 hours. And who with? Reply was ""no-one, everyone""
That's how it started. To keep a long story short, over the last few weeks I've managed to get into her messenger, they message regularly but there's nothing in the messages, other than my partner explaining that she opened up to her (SK), about our relationship because she trusts her and thinks they're very similar. Replies from SK were all team me and my partner. 
I asked her outright is there anything she needs to tell me, she assured me no. I asked outright about SK, she said no. I explained that I feel like she's gone, like she's not here. 
We came good for about a week but there were too many little things eating at me: a random shell turning up in the centre console in the car (her reason was she had to use it as an ashtray, yet it had no ash on it.) A takeaway coffe cup in her car; she doesn't drink coffee. She had the locations turned off on her ipad, iphone and watch for about a week in Find My. Gave a different excuse to both me and her stepmum about why.
It blew this weekend again because she told me she'd been talking to SK about what we should get my son for Christmas because her daughter is the same age. I said why wouldn't you speak to me about that. Then she wanted to ask her over to our house for drinks that night.
I asked to borrow her phone, saying mine was flat and went through every messaging app, messages and calls. No conversation or call history with SK. When I know there has been. So she's deleted it. I fully accused her then. I made her let me put her phone through a data recovery program but because nothing gets backed up because the storage is full, I couldn't find anything. 
Her reaction is what got me the most. She was cool, calm and collected until she started getting pissedoff while I was sobbing hysterically. She told me that me not trusting her was a me problem, not hers. She told me to ring SK and ask her myself. She told me all the things they talk about, health, family, relationships, yet where are these messages of great conversations?
I told her she was doing absolutely nothing to comfort or reassure me and if the situation was reversed, I'd be jumping through hoops to prove it wasn't true. It was like she could care less. I said can't you see what this is doing to me? She said she's not doing anything, that I've got all these little ideas in my head and I said she shouldn't be doing the things that are making me feel this way.

She also told me that they only talk on messenger, which she doesn't know I've been checking regularly. But they don't, they also talk on WhatsApp, Insta and Snapchat. There was a reel that SK had sent to my partner in Insta that she had then deleted that was from ""love.quotes.""I showed my partner and she said she never even saw it, that obviously SK had sent ot to the wrong person hence why she'd deleted it. This is what I mean by excuses/reasons for everything. I said to her why tell me you only talk on messenger when there's also 3 other platforms? And if you say you've only just recently added her phone number and that you text her a couple if days ago, where's the history gone? She said her phone had a meltdown the other day, she lost half her messages but it would seem SK is the only one affected.

Her phone doesn't leave her side, she's constantly on it and whenever I go near here, she'll jump out of whatever she's in and go back to the home screen. I bought this up as well, she said she was talking to the other girls in a group chat from the old place. The next reason was that it was always work stuff and she's goes out of it so that I don't think she's always on her phone.

I told her ""sweet guys finish last"" as a joke. She hasn't texted back in 2 days. Did I just self-sabotage?","So I (28M) have been seeing this girl (26F) for about three weeks now. Three dates total - coffee, dinner, and then last weekend we did this fun cooking class together. Everything felt really natural, lots of laughing, good chemistry.

At the end of the cooking class, we're walking to our cars and she stops, touches my arm, and says ""You know what? You're really sweet. I really appreciate how thoughtful you've been with planning these dates.""

And here's where I messed up. Instead of just saying thanks like a normal person, I got nervous and tried to be funny. I said something like ""Uh oh, sweet? Everyone knows sweet guys finish last"" with this awkward laugh.

Her smile kind of faded and she was like ""Oh... I didn't mean it like that"" and then we had this weird goodbye hug.

That was Saturday night. It's now Monday evening. Usually we text pretty regularly throughout the day. But since that moment? Radio silence. I sent her one text yesterday asking how her Sunday was - left on read.

I can't tell if I'm overthinking this or if I genuinely just torpedoed something good by revealing some deep insecurity she wasn't ready to see. Do I double text and apologize? Do I give her space? Did I just nice-guy myself out of a potential relationship?

Our doctor is not taking my concerns seriously, and its impossible to self refer anywhere without paying a fortune, so I was wondering if anyone's experience is similar. 

He is meeting milestones pretty well, but I was concerned at the 1 year mark because he didn't have any gestures or words and spotty eye contact, hence why I joined here basically looking for a glimpse into what to expect. His cousin is AUDHD but diagnosed late, so I knew the general items to look for in him  to avoid delaying diagnosis and access to resources, but this is different. He has since transformed into the most talkative, expressive and cheeky toddler. HOWEVER, he will do everything to the maxmax. 

Tantrums? They last at least 1 hour, and is impossible to soothe or reason with him. 

Laughing fits? He laughs for so long and so hard that he stops breathing and I have to blow on his face to snap him out of it. Almost like a crying breath holding spell, but with him it's laughing. 

Language exploded in the past 2 months, which I know sounds great, but he has literally hundreds of words and he labels everything he sees, all the time. chair, table, mirror, shoes, etc etc. almost every time he sees said item. Every diaper change, coffee brewed etc. is being narrated, by the BABY. He used to sleep great, but now wakes up several times a night and I hear him on the monitor talking to himself, repeating words. He uses the words to communicate as well, like ask for water, hugs, kisses, let me know he's hurt etc. but the constant labeling is kinda weird, right?

He has a letter puzzle, and he can recognize all letters, sound them out, put them in their correct slot etc. Now this can be purely shape recognition, but he spelled his name the other day (its a very simple 3 letter name that's also spelled out on his door in large block letters so he may be recreating what he sees instead of actually spelling his name), but again, it's kinda weird right?

Every night, he has to move all his socks from one drawer, to another drawer. If we don't do this, he will NOT sleep. If there's not enough socks in the drawer at the end of the moving process because its laundry day or whatever, he will proceed to look for socks everywhere to fill in the drawer. We usually just give some of our socks. Something else, like a scarf or t-shirt won't work! It has to be socks to fill the drawer. 

He has a problem with sleeves, hats and zippers. I have to make sure the sleeve on his clothes doesn't go past his wrist, hats don't cover the bottom of his ears and zippers don't touch his chin. If they do, he will scream so loud that its scary. 

Apart from the above, he now has great joint attention,brings me stuff to play with or inspect all the time, he eats well, he feeds and brushes his stuffed animals and has other kinds of pretend play,responds to his name, he has tons of gestures and socially seems to be doing well but its too early to tell since his socializing mostly consists of stealing other children's toys. 

I know he has amazing strengths, his family doctor and pediatrician don't think anything is concerning, and I agree, if it were only one thing I wouldn't think twice about ND, but all of them together so early in his life, makes me wonder what other quirks he will have even in a couple months, let alone a few years. My nephew wasn't diagnosed until he was 7 and started school, where the pressure was so much he had some pretty bad lashing outs and he was finally referred to a specialist. I don't want to allow my baby to go through that if I can help it, but before I bring him in to a private specialist and pay 2 salaries worth, please let me know if I am insane or if there's something there worth pursuing. 

Thank you for reading this far!

1. **Is it your full-time income?** Or does it just cover coffee money/server costs?

I walked toward him without him noticing… and I saw photos of our home.

Our home before it became rubble.

I saw the walls where we hung our memories, the tiles that witnessed our first steps, the window that once overlooked a garden that no longer exists. I saw the children’s swing, my father’s bookshelf, and my mother’s kitchen where the smell of her morning coffee used to fill the air. I called my siblings, and we gathered around the phone as if we were trying to touch a life that was stolen from us.

We didn’t speak. The silence inside the tent was heavier than the rain beating on the roof. In the eyes of my father, my mother, and my siblings, I saw the same ache… the same stifled scream. It felt as though the photos weren’t a reminder of the past, but a knife digging into our present.

And when my father turned off the phone, letting the darkness swallow us again, I sat in the corner of the tent on the cold ground and felt a part of my soul burn out. It wasn’t a loud collapse just a silent withering… a quiet retreat from everything we can no longer bear.

We weren’t only displaced from our homes…
We were displaced from our lives.

Our life here has become a constant attempt to survive.
We sleep in tents that breathe cold through every tear, waking up to the sound of the wind mocking fabric that barely holds together.
The ground beneath us is harsh, and the night lasts longer than it should.
Our food is not really food 
just scraps to keep us alive… a piece of dry bread, a can of beans shared among many, and a little water we try to divide fairly so no one is deprived.

Our children grow up to the sounds of explosions instead of songs, and to scenes of endless lines instead of schools. Everything that used to be normal is now a dream, and everything that used to be simple has become an unreachable luxury.

Here, in this tent, we learn that life can continue without truly living, that a person can turn into a walking shadow carrying their body while their soul cries somewhere else.

We are more than two million people trapped in a small piece of land, part of a great nation, yet standing alone without strength, without protection. We have become a burden even to ourselves… walking graves waiting for a moment of rest.

I had no confidence that i’ll pass. So so grateful! When people tell the questions are nothing like nbme or free 120 its true! but the topics are from nbme and free 120!! So dont discount that.

Nbme scores- Nbme 25- 56% (Baseline score after completing the portion once- Like touched every topic of FA and saw all the videos of BnB.

Nbme 26- 62%

Nbme 27- 65% (At this point i realised i need to do revision once Started with Mehlmans PDF and revised Fa along with it. did only few weak topics from mehlman like Immuno, Hemat, Biochem, MSK. Trust me got lot of confidence after that. took 15 days for revising all weak topics and nbme topics.

Nbme 30- 73% (was major boost in my confidence)

Nbme 31-  65% (Just on the Diwali day i gave was completely filled with anxiety, less sleep, mind was panicked, had bad migraine had to take a break in between the nbme relax myself had cold coffee)

Excused myself ki it happens as when i was reviewing the nbme 1st two blocks were bad had 20-22 questions wrong, took a little break after 2 blocks calmed myself down and last two block only 10-12 questions range was wrong!

Nbme 32- 64% gave after one week of nbme 31. Was doing some mehlman videos in between. This completely killed my confidence had to delay scheduling my exam thankfully i dint book it as slot were available. As i cant excuse as my mind was completely okay in this nbme. It was actually very tough for me. Too much Anat i guess.

Did 100 concepts of Anatomy Pdf after this. Revised the remaining FA. I never read the whole Fa at once, was just doing nbme topics from FA as and when i found it weak.

Decided i will schedule my exam if i get 70+ in Free 120.

Free 120- 70%

Booked the exam on  6th of Nov for 13th.

Was trying to revise the FA and mehlman videos on- off as anxiety was high during this period after free 120. Decided to skip nbme 33. One more low score would kill my confidence. Fell sick just 2 days before exam where i thought i would revise FA page to page fast reading. So has only 1 day before the exam Revised the basic sciences like Biochem, Immuno tables, Micro, Pharmac.

The night before the exam— Worst night of my life. Couldn’t catch one single hour of sleep. Was reading till 11 as i had not read so many topics as i fell sick. Was listening to mantras to get sleep. Praying nothing worked. At 5.30 i got up and thought to postpone the exam as i am not someone who can give the exam with no sleep. I have never given any exam in my life without sleeping for 6 hrs. My minds works the best that way. There was no clear direction if i can reschedule if i cancel the exam on the same day. 6.30 just had to have the courage to just go for it. Had cold water bath and just prayed hard that mind works and i dont fail just cause i dint sleep.

On the day of the exam- I took coffee both hot and cold, some protein bars, nuts banana. Did not have anxiety when i sat for the exam. Did lot of deep breathing while sitting outside of the center. Did not feel fatigued or sleepy as adrenaline rush did help.

Did 1st two block together then took 7-10 mins break after every block. Had some coffee in between all the blocks! Splashed cold water in every break. Had flagged almost 12-15 questions in each block. I only flagged those which i had doubt in. Thing i had no knowledge just swept thru them. 3rd block was very very bad. Completely vague. Had confidence in only arnd 10 questions in this block. 4th block was easier.

Somehow kept going throughout not thinking how the earlier block was.

After the exam- Was super anxious for few days. Only could recollect all my wrong easy questions where i could have done better! Told myself if my worst nbme where i was completely panicked i scored 64% which is a passing score. Then may be i can pass. (Just to feel hopeful) and accepted that i may fail too in any case it doesn’t matter after its done now.

Phew finally done with all the stress once the results are out.

Study material and Timeline- Started from mid-March- With FA, BnB and uworld of the systems. Had to rush by August to finish the systems. Completed all the bnb videos. 65% of uworld By Mid-Sept.

Started giving Nbmes from Mid Sept. Stopped with the uworld. Only did nbme questions! Revised nbme topics after each nbme

Mid sept to exam -
Dirty Medicine- Biochem videos
Mehlman pdfs if weak topics- Specially Hemat, Onco, Neuro, Biochem. Almost all the topics i tried to touch some part. 
Randy Neil- Biostats and Genetics videos almost in last 15 days. 
Last 15 days did mehlman videos randomly or sometimes the playlist picking one particular topic simultaneously reading it from FA. (This was very helpful for me, As i could learn how to rule out the options. And just reading FA was getting very tedious in high anxiety state). Particularly did Immuno, Hemat, Micro and physio playlists.

Thats it. Thank you. If i can pass with the bad nbme scores and worst night before the exam so can you.",11,1764159805.0,step1,8,0.92,False
