1ovn94g,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1ovn94g/just_got_back_from_a_two_week_trip_with_8_people/,Just got back from a two week trip with 8 people including two little ones- my advice,"Hello everyone.

I tried posting a various subs and had my posts removed for ‘ not doing enough planning and research ‘ before my posts. So, in the end, I did not get any details on how to plan my trip answered and ended up kind of winging it. I had a Google map that I laid out for each city. We were traveling to and saved some points of interest so that if I were in the general area, I could target them.

Was in Japan for approximately two weeks. Was me, my wife our almost 3-year-old and 1.5 year old, my in-laws, my brother-in-law, and my brother.

Started in Tokyo for four nights, Shinkansen to Kyoto for 6 nights, Shinkansen to
Kanazawa for 3 nights, then back to tokyo for the last night before we flew out.

A little background, I’ve spent 10 years or so of my adult life living in Manhattan. So, crowds are not new.

In the various subs I read, I was advised against bringing strollers. Terrible advice. Bring strollers. We brought two strollers and had no problem bringing them wherever we need to. Averaging approximately 20,000 steps a day, there’s no way your kids are gonna want to walk around. Do yourself a favor and give them a comfortable place to relax while you are out trying to see what you can.

Next, also on the topic of kids, Japan does not require you to have a car seat. This was very critical for us to know before we traveled as it allowed us to leave at home two very large bulky items. In cabs, children sit on your lap and it’s a non-issue. Traveling with a larger group, there were times we opted for a cab rather than the subway just out of convenience. Also, it’s not that expensive if you’re not going far. 

We stayed in Airbnb’s for the majority of the trip, with the exception of two nights in Kanazawa where we stayed in a hotel. We are much preferred our Airbnb experience to be able to spend time together.

Regarding the bullet train, we made the mistake of not having reserved seat seats from tokyo to Kyoto and all had to stand in the aisles, including our little ones. Probably the worst part of the trip. I would recommend grabbing your tickets maybe the day before so that you can go whichever route you’re choosing. We paid to stay in the green car which was plush. Didn’t bother with unlimited pass, as it seemed too expensive, even with this much traveling.

We did struggle finding places to eat with a group as large.  Often times, we broke up into small groups, my wife and I are taking the kids around and the remaining adult adults doing their own thing. At least three meals, we had at McDonald’s, which I did not mind at all. The quality of their food, including fast food, is so much better than what we have in the states. Also, it’s different. Teriyaki burgers, quadruple patty sandwiches. Shit was wild.

Kyoto was a madhouse of tourists. Highly recommend going to shrines either early or late. Anything that was a tourist attraction was bombarded with tourists. Kind of took away the mystique in my opinion. I imagine seeing those shrines when no one else were there would have an ethereal like feeling. Unfortunately, I was unable to experience that.

Food was surprisingly cheap.  I went to a conveyor belt sushi in Kanazawa where I was paying approximately $3.75 for two pieces of medium fatty Toro sushi. I went three days in a row was so amazing. Omicho market in Kanazawa was spectacular. I found one little lady and I’m assuming her husband who were selling deep-fried puffer fish on a stick as as well as crab on a stick. I would’ve eaten this all day. Bowls of Ramen and udon across everywhere we visit in Japan range between three and $10. For pace and quality of food and chilling, I really liked Kanazawa. 

The coffee machines in Japan on the street are unbelievable. You can get coffee in a can for about one dollar, I saw even as low as about $0.67. They serve some of their coffee hot in a can out of machines. That was new to me.

Many places will not open until 10 or 11 in the morning.  Be prepared for that. That said, food at 7-Eleven or Lawson‘s was a staple for us. Very accessible and very good.

I think my in-laws were initially worried about what they would eat in Japan, thinking all food was sushi. They were pleasantly surprised and are ready to go back for more. 

the culture was warm and inviting - including a very sweet lady and her two young ones giving my daughters sweets on the train and just being very kind individuals.  It made me sad for our state of affairs here in the states -

Google translate is your friend. Even if people don’t speak English, they are more than willing to help you if you put in some effort.  

Team labs borderless in tokyo was awesome. 
the little ones did not wanna leave.

Did both the tokyo Tower and the Tokyo Metropolitan government building (the latter  being free). Found that the tokyo Metropolitan building offered better views, was way more organized, and took less time to get in and out of than tokyo tower. Walked from there back to piss alley / Omoide okocho memory lane and had some of the best noodles around lunch in a little 8 seater counter exposed to the outside world while my little ones slept in their strollers adjacent to us.

Subsequent to tokyo tower, did something a little bit different than offered here in the sub and took a boat up from hinode pier up to asakusa- that was fun and allowed us to see the city from a different vantage point.

You don’t need a physical suica card. If you have an iPhone, you can go to wallet and add transit card and add a suica card that way. Kind of crazy, but even if the phone is dead, you can still use your card.

I could wax poetically, almost endlessly, about the trip. From Kyoto, we did day trips to nara and Osaka. Even with strollers and kids and a group of eight, it was a non-issue. 


If anyone has any questions, please ask. Japan was rad. You will enjoy it. Don’t worry about planning too much. Just go. Let Japan happen to you rather than forcing an itinerary. ",1,1762995422.0,JapanTravelTips,0,1.0,False

Dan makes the coffee and Amy makes the bed then starts the shower. As is the morning routine. He brings the coffee and they enjoy the last few minutes of peace. 

“So are you looking forward to the meeting this morning.” Amy asks. 

“Well I’m going to make a few people multimillionaires today. They have stuck with us and they deserve to be rewarded. There is no motivation like having skin in the game.”

Amy stands there in shock. “Am I one of those?”

“Not multi yet. Pull off a couple more of those deals you just did and I’ll be working for you.”

“Why? Why are you doing this?”

“I’m tired of losing top talent. I want to back away a little and let others have the headaches.”

He grabs Amy gives her a quick kiss and gets out of the shower.

“Rosie time?” Amy asks. 

Dan smiles, “my second favorite girl!” Then dresses and heads out to do chores. 

Amy gets out of the shower, throws on a robe and heads to the kitchen. She stops and goes and pulls out a pair of dress jeans, sport coat and a starched shirt. Then goes to his underwear drawer and pulls out the thong they had bought on their first date. Placed it on top of the jeans. Then heads to the kitchen. 

From the kitchen window she can see Dan and Rosie talking side by side rides.  She hops off to chase a bunny once in a while then goes running back to Dan. She loves to run. She goes to the back door and steps out on the patio by the fire pit. Rosie sees her and comes running. Almost like a cartoon she jumps and rolls over landing on her back and slides to a stop at her feet. Requesting belly rubs. Amy obliges. Then back to the kitchen to finish breakfast. 

Breakfast is waiting when Dan comes in. They sit down and Amy looks at him and for some reason her insecurity rises. “Dan I have a couple questions.”

Dan smiles his easy smile that she loves. “Well I have answers!”

“What are we? What are our rules? What do you want from me?”

Dan grabs his coffee cup and pounders those questions. “I know what it is. I know what I want it to be. It comes down to you accepting my terms and conditions for coupledom. If that is even a word.”

“So what are we?” A hint of earnest coming through. 

“We are a man and woman who’s relationship is a bit taboo to some people, who’s opinions don’t matter. That have really fantastic sex and interesting breakfast conversations.”

“Our rules?”

“We always tell the truth. All feelings are valid. Doesn’t mean they are right. Most importantly my dick is the only one you will ever touch again and I’ll never touch another woman.”

“I can agree to all that 100% except for one thing.” 

“What would that be?” A little surprised at Amy’s response. 

“What if I want you to touch other women?” 

Dans coffee cup shattered on the floor.  “What do you mean by wanting me to touch other women? What the hell!” 

“You, me and another woman in bed together having sex.” Amy blushes. “Not all the time but maybe sometime.”

“Explain.” Is the only word Dan has.

“Always together. You ever touch another woman without me there. I’ll scratch the bitch’s eyes out and they would never find your body.”

“I can understand stand that.” Dan says, a little uneasy. “Have you ever done anything like this before?”

“I would be lying to you if I said no. The qualifier is, I was a drunk and on a dare both times. It’s embarrassing to admit that to you right now.”

“I don’t have time or the band width to process all of this right now. So how about what we agree on is 100% locked down. The you, me and another woman thing can be revisited. Deal?”

“Deal. I laid out clothes for you for today.”

Dan disappears into the bedroom while Amy cleans up the coffee cup mess. In a few minutes Dan appears dressed and ready to head in to work. 

Amy lets out a cat call whistle that brings a smile to his face. “Did you put on the thong?”

“Yes I did.”

“Can I see?” Amy asks as she bites her lip. Dan unbuckles his belt and slips his jeans down about 2 inches to show her the fabric on his hip. Pulls up his jeans and buckles his belt. 

“You are just a big tease.”

Dan smiles. “I learned from the best!” Pouring a fresh cup of coffee. “See you at ten.” Then out the door. 

Amy smiles. Now she has to get even. 

She goes to the closet and pulls out a black sleeveless turtleneck. A straight legged jeans and then a nice stiletto heel. After the meeting can put on a nice tennis shoe. She made a list of what to get Rosie, a collar and leash and some bling. Groceries, have to bake before Monday. Swing by the apartment to get a few more things and a trip to the adult toy store for some fun toys for the weekend. That man has lit a fire in her. 

XOXOXOXOXOXO

Amy walks into the conference room. Dan and Charlie are already set up. Charlie pulls her aside.

“I just want to tell you myself  how impressive your work was this week. You kept your wits about you yesterday and may have set us up for a massive deal. Well done.” Charlie said.

“I was just doing my job.” Amy said trying to hide how thrilled she was with the praise. 

“Do you play golf?” 

“Not very well. More of a beer cart driver.” Being honest. 

“Not any more. Summer is almost here and we need you to brush up on your game. Local charity events and some client relations stuff. You don’t have to be good, just not bad. I’ll text you the pros number at the country club. You set up a few lessons on the company.”

“I will do that right away. So is this my invitation to the old boys network?”

“Short answer is yes.” Charlie says with a smile. Then goes back to Dan, who gives her a knowing wink. 

Sarah her work bestie shows up next. They go off to the side and catch up. 

“I don’t know what strings you pulled but thank you.” Sarah says with a big smile.

“I didn’t pull any strings.”

“Don’t lie to me. How else did they know my manager was a putz. He left for other opportunities yesterday!”

“You and Linda earned it. I didn’t do anything.”

“What no pillow talk with the Silver Fox?”

“Rule one is work stays at work.  Besides that once we are done playing around there is no energy left to talk.” 

“I need details. Coffee and details after this meeting! I need you to spill the tea!” Amy blushes at the thought. 

“You’ll need a cold shower after I’m done spilling the tea!” They both laugh and join everyone else as the meeting is about to begin. 

The meeting made everyone there very happy and some potentially very rich. Dan put on his corporate face and thanked everyone for their commitment to the company. In a lot of ways she doesn’t recognize that side of him. Although it does make her proud to say he is mine. 

After everyone cleared, Amy walks up to chat with Dan for a few minutes. 

“So what is it like being not only sexy but rich too.” Dan asks with his usual smirk. 

Amy smiles. “Not rich yet. I’m not vested yet!”

“Your contract is a little different. You will be vested at signing.”

“I don’t want special treatment. If you gave me….” Dan raised his hand, politely trying to stop her tirade before it started. 

“I can’t say anything, but let’s just say you earned it.”

Amy was wise enough to read between the lines. “Well thank you.”

“You know what this means? Amy just looks confused. “You remember one time I told you I didn’t want you with me for my money. Now you aren’t with me for the money. You could leave anytime and be well taken care of.”

 “I don’t care about your money.”Amy whispered. 

Dan smiles. “The saying goes money can’t buy happiness but it can buy blank and it’s the same thing. What’s your blank Baby Girl?”

“You.”

Dan smiles. “Thank you. I know you mean that but who is terrible at flirting now?” Amy looks blank. “For you it could be baking supplies, a new oven or more animals. What is it that brings you peace.”

Amy let’s that settle for a moment. “Can you be home at 3:00? I have something to share with you.”

“I can do that.”

“Text when you are 15 minutes away so it can be ready.”

“Will do.”

“Going to catch a coffee with Sarah, pick up steaks and get some bling for Rosie.”

Dan smiles trying not to roll his eyes. 

Amy and Sarah get coffee, only sharing the less provocative details. Then finish’s shopping. 

XOXOXOXOXO

The final stop is the adult toy store. This time she wasn’t embarrassed by walking in. She found what she wanted and a couple of surprises then headed home. 

Once she got home she set up the bed room. Pulled the comforter and top sheet off and laid down a waterproof blanket. Then she pulled out her main purchase. It was a set of bondage tie downs that went under the mattress.  The one set buckled and the wrist restraints were open but could be buckled. She found the eye mask she had purchased also. Her phone buzzed with the text message from Daddy. 

Home in 15

Amy went into the bathroom and removed all her clothes her heart was beating into her throat. She buckled her ankles in the spread Eagle position. Then laid back and put one arm in the restraint, adjusted her mask, then slipped the other arm in. There she was naked laying spread eagle on the bed. Now all she could do was wait.  

The feeling of laying there, patiently waiting for your person to come to you. The anticipation was driving her crazy. What would be Daddy’s reaction? What would he do to her? Was it to bold of move? What is taking so long? Finally she hears the garage door opening. How can that sound make even hornier. 

“High honey I’m home!” Rings out. It takes everything she has not to call out. The foot steps come closer, through the kitchen.  Her body aches for his touch. She can hear him at the door to the bedroom. The only sound a slow steady exhale. There are footsteps to the bed. She can feel him buckle first one arm in then the other. Now she is trapped. She can feel the dampness underneath her. Then she hears Dan start the shower. He walks over and gives her a light kiss. 

“I won’t be long.” He whispers in ear. Then slips down and kisses one nipple then the other. Then back to the shower. Amy squirms. The frustration starts to build. 

XOXOXOXOXO

‘Holy Fuck!’ Screams in Dan’s head. How do I play this? Thank god I thought of taking a shower to slow play this. Play it slow and make her beg for it. She has a bit of a praise kink to so let’s use that. 

Getting out of the shower snd toweling of quickly he walks back into the bedroom. 

“I see my naughty Baby Girl went shopping. You look stunning my dear.” His fingers slowly caressing her face. A very light kiss on the lips makes her groan. His finger tips just barely touching the tip of her nipples. His hands lightly brushing her stomach and hips several light kisses on her belly makes her moan and struggle. Then moving down kissing ever so gently on her clit. 

“Oh fuck.” Amy moaned finally breaking her silence. 

“Would you like more?”

“Please Daddy.” Amy moans as the clit  piercing is teased by his tongue. He then moves to the toes and kisses his way north. A couple nibbles on the insides of thighs, and she starts moaning uncontrollably.

“Please Daddy, I need to cum!”

Diving in sucking on her lips, she releases a huge wet orgasm that soaks his face. 

“Oh my god Daddy!” As she lays there pulling on the restraints in frustration unable to pull him into her. Sliding up her body and entering her in one smooth stroke. Quickly starts pounding,  setting her up for the next orgasm. Planting a kiss on that beautiful mouth. Then whispering in her ear.

“Cum for Daddy you slut.” 

She bites into his shoulder as her whole body shakes in pleasure. He quickly releases her arms as she grabs him and squeezes him close. He pumps 4 or 5 times and releases into her beautiful body, moaning into her mouth. This triggers another after shock. 

Reaching up he removes the blindfold. “Please release my legs.” She pleads. He does so and then crawls back on top of her. Legs wrapped around his ass and arms around his chest.

I love going except for one issue. There’s a girl there who I don’t vibe with. It’s come about that no one else vibes with her either… and everyone is kind of looking at me to say something to her. 

The issue is she’s very socially inept. She doesn’t understand social cues and what’s appropriate/not appropriate. She takes over EVERY conversation about how she would do this or do that, what people should be making, how to make the thing they’re already making, etc. She demands that everyone should shop at hobby lobby to buy yarn and the majority of us don’t shop there for moral reasons. we have all tried explaining our yarn preferences but every week it’s the same lecture about Hobby Lobby. When she’s not talking to people about HL, she’s loudly narrating her personal details about her period, bowel habits, and especially her multitude of cats. She corners people and makes them watch weird YouTube videos. I could go on and on. This is only a fraction. 

All the rest of the people have reached out to me and said the same thing - we don’t want her there because she makes us so uncomfortable. And I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t want to be mean or rude because I do think she genuinely means well. I just can’t continue to go to that group with her in it, and everyone else is saying the same thing. 

What would you do? Tell her to stop coming? Say the group disbanded and go meet somewhere else? Just leave the group altogether and be sad about it? Just trying to find the kindest way to distance from her

1ovn7ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossJourneyUSA/comments/1ovn7ve/is_detox_worth_it_my_honest_review_of_the_just_be/,Is Detox Worth It? My Honest Review of the Just Be Vital Cleanse for Energy and Weight Loss or The Easy Way I Flushed Toxins and Lost 6 Lbs in a Week (Cleanse Review),"# 1. The Introduction (The Pain Point: Sluggishness)

If you constantly feel heavy, bloated, and mentally foggy, you know how much it drags down your life. I was always chasing energy with coffee, but the root problem was my **digestive system**—it felt overwhelmed and backed up with toxins and accumulated waste. I needed a full system **reset**, not just another pill to mask the symptoms.

I decided to try a simple, effective detox protocol, which led me to the **Just Be Vital Cleanse**. It was promoted as a gentle, natural way to flush toxins, reset gut health, and give my metabolism a clean slate.

# 2. Why A Targeted Cleanse is Essential

This is not a harsh, restrictive juice fast; it’s a targeted supplement protocol (usually pills or a simple mix) designed to make the process gentle yet effective. The goal is to support your body's natural detox pathways:

* **Flushing Waste:** The formula likely contains natural fibers, herbs (like Psyllium, Cascara Sagrada, or Senna), and ingredients that promote gentle, regular bowel movements, effectively **clearing out built-up waste** in the colon.
* **Gut Health Reset:** By clearing out the bad stuff, the cleanse creates a better environment for healthy gut flora to thrive, directly addressing the cause of **bloating and digestive discomfort**.
* **Energy Boost:** When your digestive system isn't constantly struggling to process waste, your body frees up massive amounts of energy. This is why a good cleanse provides that amazing feeling of clarity and **vitality**.

# 3. My 7-Day Transformation (The Results)

I committed to the **Just Be Vital Cleanse** for one week, and the results were dramatic and immediate:

* **Day 1-2 (Lighter Feeling):** Immediately noticed less gas and bloat. My stomach felt flatter by the end of the second day.
* **Day 3-5 (Energy Surge):** The afternoon slump vanished! I had clean, sustained energy all day. It felt like I’d lifted a heavy veil from my mind and body.
* **Day 6-7 (Weight Loss & Clarity):** I lost a few pounds (mostly old waste and water retention) and my mental clarity was incredible. I felt motivated, focused, and genuinely lighter.

This cleanse was the perfect **system reset** I desperately needed to break bad habits and get my energy back on track.

# 4. Give Your Body the Reset It Needs (The Direct CTA and Link)

If you're tired of feeling heavy, bloated, and chronically low on energy, it's time to hit the reset button on your digestive system. Watch the presentation to see how the **Just Be Vital Cleanse** can give you back your vitality.

And no, I'm not referring to school, family, or the growing pains of being a child or young adult. Rather things or events like not having to rewind movies after renting a movie.

The first thing that came to my mind was DIVX. It was an old video disc format that competed for a brief time with DVD. The idea was that you could buy a DIVX disc for under $5, but you had to pay $1-2 every time you wanted to watch it. You would unlock the disc for 48 hours each time you wanted to play it by paying the fee. It also meant your DIVX player required a phone connection to dial in the transaction, similar to TiVo calling home for your TV guide data.

For $15-20 you could purchase a lifetime unlock. Hope not too many people got suckered into that, because by 2000 DIVX was pretty much a dead format and DVDs took over. Then all the discs became pretty much unusable shortly after.

But could you imagine? Having to pay every time your kid wanted to watch the Little Mermaid or Aladdin? I mean, it wasn't much different than Pay Per View, but with with that you didn't have to fork over the cash to buy a disc that was as good as a coffee coaster unless you forked over the money every use.",1,1762994932.0,Xennials,9,0.6,False

Feel free to skip around if you don't care what games I play.

ABOUT ME: I am a 23-year-old woman from Finland! A graduated hairdresser, fashion designer and have also studied history and archeology. I write books and poetry and have the loveliest, most cutiest patootiest borzoi ever. I am also a radical feminist! I am witty, kind, have a good sense of humor and I defend the people I love to death. I love chatting and helping people. I'm genuine and loyal, and when I'm there for you, I am there for you until the end. 

INTERESTS: I love art, movies, museums, music, tattoos, coffee, old architecture, travelling, clothes, shopping and all sorts of stuff, really. Sighthounds are my favorite dogs. I speak Finnish and English fluently and I'm studying French and refreshing my memory of Swedish.

MUSIC: Some interests of mine: punk/classic rock/alt rock/indie folk. Some of the long long list of bands and artists I adore; Hamilton Leithauser, The Smiths, Angus & Julia Stone, First Aid Kit, Sharon Van Etten, The Strokes, Skunk Anansie, Keaton Henson, Greg Laswell, The Walkmen, Big Thief, Iron & Wine, Surf Curse, Rilo Kiley, Twin Peaks, New Order, Bratmobile, Regina Spektor and Kings of Leon.

TV SHOWS: Love a ton but here are my absolute favorites; Penny Dreadful, Girlboss, Game of Thrones, HIMYM, Supernatural, Gilmore Girls, Grey's Anatomy, Sharp Objects, Fleabag, Heroes, ASOUE, Band of Brothers, New Girl, The Good Place, Stranger Things and The Office.

GAMES: Unavowed, Kathy Rain games, Skyrim, Fallout 4, Red Dead Redemption 2, Life is Strange -games, Stardew Valley and Castle Crashers.

BAD THINGS ABOUT ME (the horror!): I live in Finland. I have a chronic illness that drains my energy, so if I take a minute, it's probably not you but me. I am also really stubborn and have a hard time explaining my political stances because of memory and word loss, so I might get frustrated. I also kill every single plant I lay my eyes on.

THINGS I DISLIKE: lying, cheating, ghosting, blocking, deleting messages, dishonesty, assuming instead of asking, shockingly bad grammar, people writing et cetera as ""ect"", anime (not Ghibli), taking days to reply without a good reason, the color red, hypocrisy and not taking accountability for your own actions.

MISCELLANEOUS: I love smiling at strangers. I am afraid of puking and running in stairs. I must own, like, 50 pairs of jeans. I am an eternal romantic. I have 50+ hours on BG3 and have spent it all just making characters. 

I have a letterboxd I can share if you're a fellow movie buff and a discord account we can continue discussing on if we happen to hit it off. I can also share some of my playlists if your taste in music needs rescuing desperately.

I am ALWAYS looking for that specific person who might be my soulmate. People can be genuinely amazing and I'd be dumb if I didn't still believe that person is out there. So, don't be shy and shoot a message my way if you feel like we'd lock eyes across the room and never shut up after starting to talk!

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I’d give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It’s definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I’ve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I’m slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever’s on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it’s a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I’m more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I’m pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who’s curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn’t mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I’m drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don’t have to be a traveler (though that’s always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

Tech enthusiast.,"Hi there! I'm a 32-year-old straight guy from Cairo, Egypt—standing tall at 190 cm (or so my last measurement says), with a dad bod I'm working on upgrading to 'in-shape' by hiring a trainer next year. As a full-time IT systems admin with flexible hours managing small setups, I've got a stable routine: non-smoker (and seeking the same, no ex-smokers please), no alcohol or drugs, omnivore who enjoys all kinds of food, and aiming for those full 8 hours of sleep. Living in a cozy (okay, cramped) apartment for now, no pets yet, but open to faiths while preferring a Muslim partner who values tradition like I do.

My hobbies are mostly tech based—I've been geeking out on science and gadgets for ages, started when I was 10 really disassembling toys to make other toys. Building custom PCs since 2008, used to have a CD bag for all my favorite XP versions. Single-player games are my thing and still are, did play multi back in the day, but it is not as much fun. I'm a casual anime fan, (Gundam wings is a favorite)and a big enthusiast for high-quality In-Ear Monitors (own two pairs, though importing them to Egypt is getting really expensive). I collect seashells on beach trips, kind of hate smartwatches after amazefit failed me. Dream of building my own custom watch with hands and stuff and maybe even nixie tubes. Working on learning PCB design to create a portable battery-powered DAC/AMP for my IEMs—I'll share my Spotify playlist if you ask. Studied software engineering and working on coding projects by myself (too much vibe coding these days), though time slips away. Current goal is to get as much IT and networking/cloud related certs and actually build business ready projects. Friends call me the go-to guy for tech fixes—I'll troubleshoot all your stuff. I am a patient person, but it can run out if you are not careful.

**What I'm Looking For**  
I'm seeking a straight woman age 20-30 who shares my conservative values, prioritizing mutual loyalty, respect, and a traditional family life where home and partnership come first—ideally as a devoted housewife. Physical ideals for me include someone around 165 cm or taller (my dad always said tall women have that extra goodness!) and fair-skinned like myself, but connection matters most. Open to visits or relocation, but not we seriously click together. Let's build a serious, monogamous relationship and kids after a couple of years of stability. No rush, just deep, genuine bonding. Green flags: kindness, open communication, critical thinking (researching all angles before decisions), and emotional availability. My love languages are quality time, physical touch and all kinds of support. For a first date, a simple coffee chat to gauge real intentions sounds perfect; I'm open to early voice or video calls. Photos exchanged privately after our initial talk, always SFW—no nudes or anything like that. We can always start talking about what we like to watch (movies, shows etc). Hit me up if all of this makes sense.

**Dealbreakers**  
Look, for me, smoking is a total dealbreaker—whether it's now or something you quit years ago—along with alcohol, drugs, or anything open or non-monogamous. I'm all in for a straight-up, vice-free life, so purity, virginity and real loyalty are a huge must; no adult sites, hooking, or casual stuff on the table in any way shape or form. I just don't vibe with people who are rude to folks, animals, or even service workers, stay stuck in negativity, or act like disagreements don't matter. Details always matter. When issues come up, we sit down and talk it out honestly—no games, or any of that psychology weird tricks and other manipulation crap. If this lines up with who you are as a person, we're golden; if not, it's cool, no hard feelings.",1,1762994145.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

Today! Getting back to form after whatever happened yesterday, I'd like to talk about the first ever known nut in the world. The walnut. 

Discovered to have lived around 7000-10,000 BC (My sources say conflicting things) this family of nut, which includes pecans and hickories were not only the first nuts, but also one of the first recorded tree foods. 

In the spirit of returning to form, let's talk about what foods walnuts can be used in! 

Walnuts can be added to many dishes, from baking, to sweets, sauces and snacks. Starting from the basics, oatmeal! And solid all rounder breakfast food, not the most glamourus but can be trusted to be consistently... Okay. With the addition of walnut bits you can make it just that little bit better. 

Walnuts can be ground down and made into pesto, like our good friend the almond, but, it can also be used as a ground Parmesan cheese substitute! I love Parmesan cheese, so I was kinda happy to hear this. Maybe I'll try it out someday. 

I mentioned baking before, right? Don't worry, I didn't forget. I'd be here all night if I listed everything so let's just talk about coffee cake. 

Now, I'm not a fan of coffee. Or hot drinks in general, really. Not saying they're bad, I just don't like em. Thing is, I also believe hot things should be consumed hot and vice versa, so I'm also averse to trying coffee cold. All to say, I probably won't try this? But there's so many coffee enjoyers out there, I'm sure someone would be interested. 

Alright, that's all I have tonight. Tomorrow, let's talk about nut substitutes, for our sadly allergic friends out there.

So a bit of backround, I was a very outgoing guy living life with 0 thought about consequences and 0 fears but growing older, my questions about the universe were born. Until then I had stayed put with religion and left it at that. But later on, when I started studying in University, I also started reading a lot of Physics, Cosmology, Philosphy etc as because it felt amazing. I did this for some years until it backfired with a terrible anxiety attack last summer.

It was when I felt the depth of existance. At the beggining, I thought it was the end of my sanity. I was still functional, sure.. But the whole situation was absolutely terrible, I literally started overthinking every single thing around me, every arbitary idea you could think of, and every hypothetical scenario that made sense scientifically, even tho practically the possibility of it happening was 0. The whole world around me, the one I enjoyed to live for 24 years suddenly felt like the scariest thing I have ever felt. Before I fell asleep, lying in bed, thought that the bed I loved do much for so many years is just fucking molecules and quantum particles. I was thinking of space itself, the one we move into and tried to understand what the fuck it is. 

I though it was the end of me, literally, because I was so happy in life and carefree which made it even worse to feel like I can't do shit. 

Well, now a year has passed, never visited a therapist, or specialist and I've learned some things by myself. First of all, I feel way better on the part of existential fear. I don't know how long its been since I actually got anxiety attack from it. The feeling of derealization is completely forgotten and I feel like i felt before it happened, 99% of the time. 

Now what did I learn from this experience and what helped me to move on:

1) Time heals everything.
I know how it feels, its like a shift in the whole perspective.It feels like you are done for, because existance is not an object that you can do something about. Fear of spiders? You just avoid. Heights? You just avoid. Existance can't be avoided. And then you think that everything you do to cope won't help because it is part of the problem. 
But this thinking is WRONG! You were, is and always will be part of reality. And you gave this chaos meaning from the first time you opened your eyes even subconsciously. You feel like now things are different, that you see the universe face to face, without a mask, without any delusion, but in reality.. you see shit. This is still a SUBJECTIVE experience. You see nothing of how reality is. You just see it through a filter of fear instead of joy. Still subjective, nothing changed. And you still can shift this thinking around again, because the brain will eventually stop caring when you feed it with something else. See it as a video game you eventually got bored of. Its literally the same feeling.


2)There are propably other underlying psychological or emotional issues.

When I stopped thinking about existance, I noticed that my brain didn't stop bothering me. Guilt appeared for long forgoten past choices, abnormal fear of losing people I love, abnormal feelings of hatred towards people who did cause me damage, abnormal OCD-ish thoughts about idiotic stuff and a lot more. A storm of emotions, thoughts, feelings that where too INTENSE, everyone feels those, but the intensity was just not normal. 
I understood that I am simply just an overthinker with tons of anxiety, trauma from past choices, cant accept myself, and incredibly immature emotionally. I could live peacefully before.. only because I drowned all those issues. But certain stressfull events caused their relapse. So if you fear existance, there is a very high chance that your brain latches there, because there is nothing else to latch on for the moment and flags it as the only ""problem"". So an underlying issue with anxiety disorders could be the reason. 


3) Act, even if you are afraid.

I know how difficult it is, but keep moving. Do your shit, whatever you do. Don't miss uni, coffee with friends, gym, whatever. Your brain will eventually reprogram itself to care again about things you always did instead of fearing existance. You will eventually see that the strong emotions of the things you love, will filter the fear and you will be able to think about existance without giving a shit as time passes. The effect will flactuate, it won't work instantly of course.


4)  STOP OVERTHINKING 
This perhaps is the most difficult but if you are a deep mind, when you catch your brain analysing shitty things just stop it, it's a trap. Just an objective trap. Search CBT, helps a lot. 
Also, stay away from existential subjects for some time. Even tho you feel like you are ready to return, just don't. 

5) Do not neglect this issue like me
Go see a therapist, I will tomorrow after so many years, for my first time. I don't care any more, I just want to be happy and not let my brain make me suffer. That's all.

1ovmmyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1ovmmyt/my_daughters_gymnastics_coach_ch_4/,My Daughter's Gymnastics Coach (Ch 4),"**Chapter Four**

**All characters in this story are 18 or older.**

He had seen me watching him, yes, there had been eye-contact. But I got the fucky out of there as fast as I could, eye-contact or no eye-contact, I did not want that girl, or anyone else, to know what I had just seen.

I had learned for myself just how deep this thing was; brazenly walking through the girl's locker room, brazenly receiving blowjobs from students at 4:47 in the afternoon.

This guy had balls, huge balls, enormous balls. I had just seen them, but I must not have seen them clearly, because his balls had to be as big as basketballs.

Either that or he had a stranglehold on the whole system, the goods on someone, or he was paying someone off. Who knows? But something was going on, some kind of conspiracy, I didn't know what exactly, but it was something dark and deep and mysterious.

Driving home, I felt guilty, if you can believe that. It was he who was receiving a blowjob from a student, in his office, on government property, at 4:47 in the afternoon, yet it was me who was feeling guilty. How fucked up and cowardly is that?

I decided right then that I would say nothing about the blowjob, at least not yet. I would get to the bottom of this, the full story, every detail, but until then, I would say nothing about witnessing blowjob.

Reagan was probably home at that very moment, doing her homework. I had to appear calm. As a father, my job was to help her stay in that beautiful innocent world of hers for as long as possible. At least I hoped it was still innocent.

Driving down my street, and then pulling into the driveway, I parked the car and took several deep breaths before climbing out.

Entering through the back door, I walked into the kitchen and found Reagan sitting at the 'big table' working on her science project.

We have two tables; the 'big table' and the 'little table'. The big one is an oak table which we use for dinner. The little table is just a small patio-looking thing we bought from IKEA and use for breakfast and snacks.

Since Karen was out of town, I was allowing Reagan to use the entire 'big table' to spread out all her materials. She had all kinds of crazy shit spread all across it; papers on top of papers, but also her laptop, her printer, straws, markers, crayons, and Popsicle sticks. She was really going to town on whatever it was she was creating. She was a great student and almost always received As in her classes.

""Hey sweetie."" I said.

She looked up from the table and gave me one of those deep-in-thought looks, then responded,

""Hey, dad.""

I walked closer to her.

""Boy, that is quite the science project you've got there. What are you building, an atom bomb?""

She gave me the sincere chuckle I was hoping for.

I moved in and sat across from her. She was wearing the standard white Polo shirt with the school's logo over her left breast. There were at least ten identical shirts hanging in her closet. I could barely catch a glimpse of bra cups against the swell of a large breast.

We talked for a minute or two. I learned she was building a model comparing predators to prey in the animal world.

Suddenly the phone in the pocket of my shirt made it's noise. Pulling it out and glancing at it, there was a number on the screen I did not recognize.

""Hello"" I answered.

""Hello"" the voice on the other end responded, ""This is Travis Johnson, Reagan's coach. Am I speaking with her father?""

*Dear God*

""Oh, hello. Yes it is."" I managed to say.

The voice continued, ""Would you mind if I stopped by your home in the next few minutes to have a word with you? It should not take long?""

*Dear fuck!*

I should have told him that now was not a good time. I should have told him he was a perverted fuck who would be fired once I was finished with my investigation. I should have told him one of a dozen things. But before I knew what I was doing, these words were exiting my mouth;

""Why yes, now would be a fine time for a visit.""

""Great, I should be there in about five or ten minutes."" He said.

""Sounds good, see you then.""

Then I pressed the red button on the phone's screen and ended the call.

Slowly I placed the phone back in my pocket.

*Ok, just stay calm, you must appear calm and uninterested when you mention it to her. You are a man who did not just see her coach receiving a blowjob from a cheerleader.*

""Who was that?"" she asked.

""That, Sweetie, was your gymnastics coach."" I answered.

I might as well have told her a tidal wave was about to hit the house. Her head shot up from what she was doing. Staring at me, her eyes were wide, almost terrified.

""Coach is coming here?""

""Yes,"" I said with an authentic chuckle. ""I figured that was OK. Are you OK with that?""

She looked away and started to back-track, ""Oh, well, of course it's OK. I'm just busy with this.""

In a fatherly tone I said ""Well, he actually didn't even mention anything about you. He wants to speak with me."" I said it as if she might not even be invited to sit with us.

Trying desperately to hide her anxiety, she asked, ""So, he said nothing about me?""

""Nope, not one word."" I answered.

There was an odd moment of silence, then I asked,

""Sweetie, you seem to get really nervous when the subject of 'the coach' comes up, is everything OK between you two?""

*Are you also giving him blowjobs at school while wearing nothing but your panties?*

""Yes, everything is fine,"" she sighed and looked down, ""It's just . . . he is a man who demands a lot from his students and I get anxious when I interact with him outside gymnastics.""

*Good, good, this is good, she's not bullshitting me, she is finally speaking openly and freely about this*.

But I was still nervous, ""I understand. Well, if anything weird ever happens, you know you can always talk to me about it? I'm your dad, that's my job.""

""He doesn't do anything weird,"" she said, almost in a chuckle. Then, with her eyes lowered and focused on nothing at all, she added, ""But he has enlarged my mind, I suppose that could be considered weird.""

*Man, this guy really has his hooks in her.*

Suddenly a feeling came over me that the answers to the questions I was asking would be more awful than the situation in the locker room. She spoke about the man as if he were something from the supernatural world, a warlock or a necromancer or a man-god, something to lift up, bow down before, and offer sacrifice to.

Perhaps this thing was even bigger than I had suspected.

Changing the subject and slowly standing up, ""Well, he will be here soon. Let me check the front room and make sure there is no clutter in there.""

Five minutes later, the doorbell rang. Reagan had gone up to her room to wait. She was probably listening from the top of the stairs.

When I opened the door, there he was. The dark glasses he always wore made his seem a charismatic 'Jim Jones' Messiah type.

Wearing a red exercise suit of some sort, he seemed much larger than before and seemed to fill the entire doorway.

""Hello."" He said as he stepped forward respectfully.

""Hello."" I answered as I held the door open for him.

We shook hands, both of us were thinking of the blowjob we had just witnessed but were pretending we were not.

I invited him into the living room and we sat across from each other. Ten feet or so of space plus a coffee table separated us.

After a few minutes of uncomfortable small talk, he decided to broach the subject,

""Well, I don't want to take up too much of your evening. I suppose I called because I felt it necessary for us to discuss what you just witnessed back at the school.""

""All right, please do."" I said.

I was trying hard not to appear a detective interviewing a culprit, but that's how I felt.

""But before that, I would like to speak with Reagan for a minute. Is she home?""

I felt a twinge of apprehension sweep up from my guts and clutch at my heart.

""Uh, sure."" I said while reaching for my phone. ""She's upstairs, let me send her a text.""

It did not take long for Reagan to enter the room, the coach remained seated as he spoke,

""Hello, Sweetie.""

""Hi, coach.""

She was still wearing her school uniform. A white polo shirt tucked into a blue-plaid skirt. She had not removed her shoes; blue high tops. Her hair was brushed back, but was no longer in a ponytail like it had been before she went upstairs.

""Why don't you come over here, Sweetie. Come stand next to me.""

As she walked towards him, her shoulders were hunched more than they normally were.

Once she was within arms length he slowly reached around her waist and turned her towards me.

Gazing at her face, he reached up and gently caressed her cheek as he spoke,

""You truly are a beautiful young lady.""

""Thank you."" She answered softly.

Lowering his hand, he turned to me and said, ""The school's dress code for many years has stated that girls must wear the standard uniform. The problem has been the boys. They love to lift up the girl's skirts and expose their panties. So years ago the girls started wearing shorts beneath their skirts.""

I nodded in comprehension but wondered where this was going.

He continued, ""The problem is, the girls are not learning to sit like ladies, they sit with their legs spread all over the place. So I demand that my girls wear nothing beneath their uniforms but a matching pair of bra and panties. No shorts, no under-shirts, no thongs, no sports bras.""

He turned to Reagan, ""Isn't that right, Sweetie?""

""Yes, coach.""

""Have you been following the rules?

""Yes, coach.""

""What do you have under your uniform?""

""A pair of bra and panties.""

""Matching?""

""Yes, coach.""

""Good, very good. But let's just have a quick look to make sure.""

I felt a pleasant stiffening in my dick. My balls began to churn.

Gripping the bottom of her skirt, her body stiffened and she looked to me, then looked away.

Without any hesitation the coach began lifting the skirt and soon the tops of her thighs were exposed. But the skirt continued riding upwards until her white panties were completely exposed.

There was a pause of profound stillness. I was amazed by his boldness, but my prick was throbbing, it was hard and pointed downwards into my underwear. My balls quivered and ached.

Holding the skirt up, we both took in the view of her beautiful panties. Just plain white panties, but they were clean and new as if she had just removed them from the box they were sold in.

Her skin around the panties was flawless without a hint of cellulite anywhere. Her pussy-area was beautiful and tight, and the cotton material stretching across it was filled nicely to its limits.

Focusing on her pussy, in admiration the coach finally spoke, ""Beautiful, absolutely beautiful.""

He was enjoying the fuck out of this.

""Good job, Sweetie, only panties. Do the boys lift your skirt as you walk past?""

""Yes.""

""And sometimes they take pictures don't they.""

""Yes.""

""What do you do?""

""There's not much you can do. It's always the same boys, so when you see them coming you just put your hands by your sides to hold your skirt down, then you start running.""

""Yes, those boys can be rascals"" He said as he lowered the skirt.

Glancing to him to see what he would do next, I watched his focus shift upwards, his dark eyes roved back and forth across her breasts.

A silence hung in the room. Reagan's breasts were rising and falling in a solid rhythm; swelling outward and tightening the material of her shirt before deflating back. It seemed the entire universe was focused on her tits.

""All right, how about the bra, does it match the panties?""

Softly Reagan answered, ""Yes.""

A part of me hoped the man would believe her, another part hoped he would not.

""Well, let's have a look to make sure.""

*Oh Fuck*

Reaching up, he pinched that portion of shirt just above her waist and began tugging it out of the skirt. When the hem of her shirt came loose, a flash of pale stomach presented itself then was gone.

Glancing to his face, it held an amused aspect, powerful, almost vengeful. He was thrilled with what he was doing to her. I was not stopping him, neither was she. She was his toy, and there was absolutely nothing preventing him from doing whatever he wanted with her

The shirt continued to rise, and soon he was barring a beautiful gymnast's stomach. But he continued lifting it until it traversed her entire body. Raising it all the way to her chin, he made sure we could both see her complete chest.

*Dear Fuck!*

There they were, out in the open and fully exposed, a pair of cock-stirring breasts held in place by a beautiful white bra.

Her petite little frame made them appear absolutely massive. Bulging out of the top of the cups, they almost appeared engorged. Her stomach was so tight and thin compared to them, and the bra straps seemed too small to hold them up.

They were beautiful tits, literally the most beautiful things I had ever seen. Round and smooth and riding high on her chest. I had never seen her in a bra. The closest I had seen was when she wore a bikini. But there was something different about this. This was degrading, an intrusion, an invasion of her body. Her coach was having his way with her, and I was allowing it, allowing it for my own sexual gratification. The whole thing was extremely dark, just plain raw. Beyond raw, it was primal, primitive, primeval.

I noticed the coach had leaned in closer, close enough for the air exiting his mouth to blow across her chest.

Suddenly, without a shred of hesitation, his large hand reached up and engulfed the bottom-half of one of her breasts.

Her body stiffened. Then, slowly but firmly, he squeezed the breast and watched in fascination the pale tit-flesh bulging upwards above the cup.

""What size are they?"" The coach asked.

""Thirty-four double-D."" Reagan answered.

""That's a beautiful size. Extremely large for a girl your size and age. I've seen your breasts in the locker room, but never up close like this.""

""Do the boys look at them a lot?""

""Yes.""

""Do they ever grab at them as they run past?

""Yes, sometimes.""

""Well, boys will be boys"" he said as he removed his hand from her breast.

Then he lowered the material down over her bra.

Someone gave a Tim Hortons drive-thru one star, not for getting the order wrong, not for being rude, not for long wait times… but because the worker “looked sad and unpleasant.”

Maybe, just maybe, that’s because she’s working for minimum wage, probably understaffed, overworked, and treated like a robot expected to smile endlessly while juggling cars, timers, and orders.

But no, the reviewer decided that the worker’s facial expression was “poor customer service” and vowed to never return. Like yeah, go punish someone making barely enough to live because they didn’t fake joy for your coffee run.

This is the kind of entitlement that keeps emotional labor invisible. People don’t want service, they want servitude with a smile.

over the following weeks, i began to notice how messy she was—leaving dirty dishes in the sink for days, food still on the stove, a mess in the tub after showering, coffee stains on the counters, appliances still plugged into the walls.. at first i tried to show her grace and cleaned up after her a few times especially when she wasn’t home for me to ask her to clean up herself. i personally seriously hate living with a mess and i cannot function when there’s a mess nearby. it began to bug me a lot after a while. 

one day, i left her a kind note asking her to be considerate of our common areas that we share. i added cute stickers and smiley faces and everything just to show that my intentions were pure. ever since then, she has stopped greeting me, stop talking to me all together and treating me as if i am an eye sore. she will even start leaving me small notes about the littlest things just to pick at me. all because i asked her to clean up after herself. btw i am F24 and she is F26, which means she is older than me in the first place. 

on occasion i have tried to tell our landlord about her disgusting habits and ask for these issues to be address before we started seeing things like bugs or mice running around. they hardly listened to me but now they want to have a house meeting because of the growing tension between she and i. i am a ready but a little nervous since i usually do not like confrontations that could lead to arguments, but at this point i dont know what else to do. she needs to be told about herself and her inconsiderate behavior…",1,1762993722.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False

He’s the one who never made it out.,"I was a socially awkward kid, the kind who ate lunch away from everyone and rarely said a word. Making friends seemed like something everyone but me could do, until I met Seth.

We were at school and I happened to hear him talking about the new game his mom bought him. It was a game I happened to be really into so I jumped into the conversation before I could talk myself out of it. We bonded over our love of the game and he invited me over. We’ve been best friends ever since.

Seth and I spent most of our summers talking about things we’d never actually do. We made big plans and never followed through. But one day, we decided we were really going to build a treehouse.

After convincing both our parents, all that was left was finding the right spot. Behind Seth’s house was a dense pine forest, so that was the obvious choice. We searched for about half an hour through the humid, sticky, air. Trees of all shapes and sizes surrounded us as the crickets and birds sang. Eventually we stumbled into a clearing.

It looked almost too perfect—a circle, maybe fifty or seventy-five feet across. Right in the center stood an old stone well, nearly swallowed by moss. The moss was reminiscent of a giant snake, slithering its way up and down the well.

The moment I saw it, I felt something shift. Not fear exactly, but a pull. Like it had been waiting for us.

“Dude, this is perfect!” he said walking up to the well as if it was another blade of grass, “We can build the tree house over there—away from the creepy stone thing.”

I wasn’t looking at the tree line though, I was still staring at the well. Seth kept rambling about treehouse ideas, but I kept drifting toward the well. As I got closer, I noticed the stone around the rim had been chiseled in a ripple pattern that spread toward the water hole.

The well was about ten feet deep before dropping off into an even darker pit. I almost missed it—but as I stared at the far wall, transfixed, I saw something. There, on a narrow ledge of dirt jutting from the inner wall, sat a single black dahlia.

“Travis, what’re you doing?” Seth’s voice broke me from the trance as I staggered backwards.

“I was just looking at this well. It’s beautiful.”

“The well is beautiful?”

“Yeah…” Seth gave a short laugh, but it didn’t sound amused.

“You’re kinda freaking me out man, are you getting enough sleep?”

“Yeah,” I said, not even sure if I snapped out of my trance. “I’m fine.” Seth walked up to me and looked at the well.

“Is there anything down there?”

“Nothing really, just a flower and water.” Seth walked closer and peeked into the hole.

“What flower?” I blinked. The flower was gone. Not fallen—gone. No trace of it on the stones below, no sign of it ever being there at all. I didn’t answer him. My eyes were still locked on the place where it had been. My skin crawled.

“Let’s just go back to your place, we can do this tomorrow. You’re not looking so good.” I nodded, still not fully looking away from the well. It felt like turning your back on something you’re not sure is real—or worse, something you were sure was.

We walked back to my house in near silence, occasionally breaking it to point out an animal or make some half-hearted comment about the woods. The summer heat was still heavy, but it was suddenly a lot less noticeable.

The trees whispered above us, branches swaying as the wind blew across them. The air felt different—not colder or thicker, but wrong. Like something had shifted in the clearing. Something I couldn’t name, let alone understand.

When we got to my place I told my mom I wasn’t feeling well. She offered me some soup and ginger ale but I declined. My room was familiar—posters on the wall, controller wires tangled together on the carpet, the ceiling fan clicking with every rotation, but I couldn’t settle.

My mind kept circling back to the well. The flower. The way it vanished, like it had never existed at all. Seth booted up Mortal Kombat and handed me a controller. I lost every match we played. I couldn’t focus, I felt anxious, like I was being watched.

That night, I dreamt of the clearing and the well. The sky was grey and dreary and the forest was covered in shadows. I looked around and saw nothing strange so I started walking towards the well. As I approached it, black, thorny vines started slithering out of the well and approaching me. I tried to run but vines came up from the ground and wrapped around my feet. I was stuck in place as the vines started to wrap around me, cutting into my flesh. Hundreds of thorns poked into me as I collapsed into a bed of vines. The vines slowly made their way up my body.

I screamed as thorns tore through my skin, sharp and endless. I thrashed and struggled but it only pushed them deeper into me. I eventually gave up, tears rolling down my face as I accepted my fate. Right before I was completely swallowed by the vines I saw something. A silhouette behind the tree line, human-like in shape. There was something off about it though. I stared at it as the vines slowly engulfed my entire body.

I jolted upright, chest heaving, heart slamming against my ribs. It took minutes to steady my breath, to remind myself I was safe. I grounded myself, counting each breath until I felt stable again. As I got out of bed I looked around my room. Nothing was out of the ordinary and there was nothing going on. I let out a sigh of relief before turning around. What I saw still haunts me. Sitting right there on the outside of my window, was a single Black Dahlia.

I opened my window, heart still pounding from the nightmare. The flower was still there. I reached out and grabbed it, my fingers brushing the petals—and I felt dizzy. My knees buckled slightly as I placed the flower on my nightstand and sat back down. I took deep breaths until the black dots faded from my vision.

When I stood again, the flower was gone. Not wilted or on the floor. Just… gone. My heart sank. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe the heat had gotten to me yesterday and now my brain was playing tricks. I told myself that over and over as I got dressed—trying to believe it. I called Seth. We agreed to hang out at his place that afternoon.

Until then, I just lay around the house, trying not to think about the well. About the flower. About the way it vanished right in front of me—again. As time passed I looked at the clock, 10:07, I sighed heavily as I waited for time to pass. It felt like maybe ten minutes had passed—but when I looked again, it was 11:02. I was confused—how had so much time passed in what felt like a moment?

As 12 o’clock approached I got my shoes on and got ready to leave. As I was about to walk out I saw my cat, King, eating out of his food bowl. I walked up to him to try to pet him but his tail raised up as he slowly backed away. He hissed repeatedly before running away incredibly fast.

I had known King since he was a kitten, he’d never hissed at me before, not even when I’d accidentally stepped on his tail. I stared down the hallway that King had vanished in, there was a shadow, a black figure that dragged something behind it as it disappeared into the darkness. I tried to shake it off and as I walked out the front door.

The sky was cold and grey when I stepped outside. By the time I crossed the street, the drizzle had turned to a downpour. Then thunder cracked, low and heavy, and rain fell in sheets. I walked into Seth’s house soaked to the bone, water dripping from my sleeves. I shivered as I climbed the stairs, only stopping to wave at his mom who was making her famous French onion soup. He laughed when I stepped into his room and tossed me a towel. “You look like you got hit by a wave,” he said.

I forced a smile as I started drying off.

“The weather hates me. What can I say?” I peeled off my coat, letting it hit the floor with a wet flop. “I think this thing’s done for.”

Seth slid further onto his bed, getting comfortable. “You’ve had that coat since, what—sixth grade? Just burn it already. Put it out of its misery.”

“I can’t. It’s sentimental.”

“Dude, it smells like that well water from yesterday.” I tried to laugh, but it came out thin. “I’m surprised mom even let you in the house looking like that.”

“She offered soup. I said no.”

“Dude. You turned down my mom’s soup? You’re actually crazy.”

“Maybe.” He raised an eyebrow.

“I don’t know. I didn’t sleep much.”

“Nightmares?”I hesitated.

“Sort of.”

“About the well that freaked you out?”

“About what was in the well.” He didn’t respond instantly. He just looked at me for a second—longer than usual—and then handed me the game controller.

“Nightmares are weird man, try not to think about it too much. What you should think about is who you’re going to play while you lose like ten times in a row.” I tried to shake it off and sat across from him while he started navigating the menu; talking about new combos he discovered.

I wasn’t really listening though, I was letting my attention wander around the room. It was all familiar—posters we’d both picked out, a bookshelf full of comics we collected, and on top sat photos of summers and birthdays gone.

One picture caught my eye. It was us—maybe ten or eleven—standing in his backyard. I remembered that day: water balloons, grilled hot dogs, the rusty old trampoline with a few broken springs. But something was off.

The background looked darker than it should’ve. The trees behind us—too many. Thicker. Tangled. And near my leg, in the bottom corner of the frame, I saw something I didn’t remember: a line of black, like vines creeping through the grass.

I leaned closer. One of the vines curled upward, almost touching my ankle. “Hey, Seth,” I said, my voice low. “When was this picture taken?”

“Uhm… I’m not sure, years ago.”

“You need to see this.” I walked over and held the frame up to his face. He took it, glanced down, then back at me.

“What’s the big deal? This looks fine.” I blinked, the vines were still there, plain as day.

“You don’t see those thorny vines?” His brow furrowed.

“What are you talking about? I don’t see anything, man. Maybe you’re just—y’know—still wound up from yesterday?”

“I’m telling you, they’re right there. You seriously can’t see those vines?” Seth hesitated for a moment.

“No. And you’re kinda freaking me out.” I opened my mouth, closed it, then stared at the frame again. The vines were still there. Crawling. Twisting. Almost reaching me. Why couldn’t he see them?

“I had a dream last night…” I said, the words fumbling out of my mouth faster than I had intended.

“The well was there. The flower. Black vines—these vines—coming out of the ground, wrapping around me. Cutting into me.” Seth stayed silent, expression on his face still as I talked. “They had sharp thorns. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. They squeezed tighter as they moved higher up my body. And right before they covered my face-“ I looked up at him.

“There was something in the trees… watching.” Seth shifted in the bed as he spoke.

“Okay… maybe you need to just-“

“And this morning,” I interrupted. “There was a black flower sitting on my window ledge.” I held his gaze as he looked at me confused. “It disappeared. Twice.” Seth exhaled slowly while rubbing the back of his neck.

“You really didn’t sleep much last night did you?”

I didn’t respond, I just stared at the photo. The vines seemingly got longer with each glance I took.

“Maybe we shouldn’t go back there,” he added.

That’s when I stood up.

“No. We have to.”

“What?”

“I need to see it again. The well. The clearing. All of it.”

“Dude—why?”

“Because I’m not crazy,” I snapped back. “Or if I am, I need to know for sure.”Seth stood up.

“Think about what you’re saying. If the well really is what you think it is, then there’s no point in going straight to it.” I opened my mouth to argue—but nothing came out. He wasn’t wrong. Not exactly.

“So what do I do?” I asked.

“Start small,” he said. “You wanna know what it is? Then figure out where it came from first.” I looked at the photo again, the vines still twisting toward my leg. I knew what I saw.

“Fine,” I muttered. “But I’m not letting this go.” I didn’t argue. Not out loud. But even as we sat back down and the game flickered on, my thoughts kept circling. The dream. The flower. The vines crawling into that photograph like they belonged there.

Seth couldn’t see them—but I could. And I didn’t care if it meant I was losing it. I had to know why. I left an hour later, walking home under the dull gray sky, the wind pushing dead leaves into the street. The clearing was off-limits—for now—but maybe there was another way to get answers.

When I got home I opened my laptop, typed “old stone well Pinewood Forest,” and hit enter. And there it was—on the first page: “The Mouth of Dahlia—Urban Legends and Vanishing Boys.” I stared at the blue website name—scared to click on it. The page loaded slowly. It looked like a blog—basic white background, outdated fonts, barely readable. The article was dated 2009.

“Hidden deep in ——— sits a moss-covered well known to some locals as ‘The Mouth of Dahlia.’” It talked about disappearances—three boys in the ‘40s, a hiking group in ‘78, another kid in the ‘90s. No bodies. No signs. Just a black flower found near where they vanished. I kept scrolling.

“Some believe the well isn’t a structure but a living thing—a mouth that feeds on people. A boundary between our world and something older. Others claim the well to be a portal to hell or an otherworldly plane.” My stomach turned. A figure in the trees. Dreams. The flower. “The flower doesn’t grow naturally in this region. But it keeps appearing. Those who see it—never forget.”

I sat back in my chair, hands clammy. I wasn’t crazy or delusional, I was being hunted. It wasn’t just a nightmare anymore. I had seen that flower, and now I knew its name.

I couldn’t sleep that night. I kept seeing the flower every time I closed my eyes. By morning, I’d memorized the article. But it wasn’t enough. I needed something older. Something real. The local library opened at 10:00. I was waiting outside by 9:45.

I was at the library when the doors opened. No sleep. No appetite. Just a buzzing need to know. The reference section smelled like dust and forgotten things. The librarian barely looked up when I asked about Pinewood’s history—just pointed toward a shelf marked “Local Archives.” Most of the books looked untouched. Brown covers, warped spines, handwritten call numbers in faded ink. I scanned titles until one caught my eye:

“Structures of Significance: Settlements and Monuments of Pinewood County.” I pulled it down and flipped through yellowing pages until I found a section labeled: The Dahlia Well

“Constructed in 1885 by Harold, a local stoneworker, the well was originally intended to supply water to the southern edge of what was then known as Millet Farm. It was named after his wife, Dahlia, whose favorite flower inspired both the name and the carved vine motifs still visible on the structure today.” I paused. Vines.

“According to local accounts, Dahlia died under unclear circumstances shortly after the well was completed.”

“After her death, strange reports began circulating—missing animals, inexplicable dreams, and sightings of a ‘woman in black’ near the forest’s edge. Though never confirmed, these incidents led some to believe Dahlia’s spirit had become bound to the well, either by grief, or by something darker.” There was no conclusion. No resolution. Just a final line: “While skeptics dismiss these tales as rural superstition, the well has remained a source of quiet fascination—and quiet fear—for over a century.”

I closed the book slowly, my fingers tight around the cover. The carving. The dreams. The flower. Maybe it was just a story. But maybe she was still there.

I walked out of the library in the hot hours of the afternoon. The clouds parting and sun shining reminding me of what life was like before the well. I should have felt comforted by the warmth. But I didn’t.

The air felt too bright, like the world had overcorrected. Everything was golden and gleaming—too clean, too alive. I blinked into the sunlight, and for a second I felt like I was looking at something I didn’t belong in anymore.

People walked past me without noticing, laughing, talking, chewing on the ends of iced coffee straws and complaining about the heat. I wondered if they’d ever seen the flower—if they’d remember that they had. Or maybe I was the only person to feel this way.

I didn’t go home. I walked—no direction in mind. I passed a broken streetlamp with a vine coiled around it. One of the leaves looked… different. Almost shaped like a mouth. I stopped walking. I took a photo. Zoomed in. It was just a leaf. But no—was it?

When I got home I laid everything out. Notes, print-outs, hand-drawn maps I had made. I circled the location of the well, my house, and the street lamp. I drew a line—and then another. The intersections didn’t mean anything yet, but something in my bones said they would. I stood back. looked at the angles. Measured distances with a ruler I hadn’t touched in forever.

The paper didn’t give answers, but it started to hum. Not literally. Not out loud. Just beneath the surface of the silence, like the house itself was listening. That’s when I remembered the archive box.

Last week, tucked in a back room of the library, there had been a stack of unlabeled cartons—donated by the First Presbyterian Church when they’d cleared out their basement. Most were full of hymns and yellowed bulletins. But one had older material.

Parish logs, burial certificates, handwritten sermon notes. I’d flipped through it without care. It wasn’t catalogued. Not even alphabetized. I’d only opened it because the box was broken and sagging at the corners.

There’d been a letter inside, folded between two brittle sheets of cemetery records. I don’t remember reading the whole thing at the time—just the date, the name of the author, and the strange scrawl of handwriting like he’d written it with a broken nail. I only brought it home because it looked out of place. An instinct. Or maybe the well had already started nudging. Now it was on the table, waiting. I unfolded the page, and read the letter in full for the first time.

14 August, 1872

Rectory of St. Bellamy's Parish

Crook’s Hollow, County Wexford

To whomever should, by Providence or misfortune, come upon this missive— I write not as a man of sound standing, but as one…

…by knowledge that ought never have been touched. I have seen a thing which the earth has no name for. The villagers speak of a woman. They say her spirit lingers in the old well—that her sorrow poisons the ground, that she hungers for company. I have heard the tales, and I tell you now: they are wrong. The well is not haunted. It is—

…I have stood upon its stones and felt a warmth rise that is not the sun’s doing. I have looked into its depths and dreamed things I do not believe were ever mine to dream. Prayers spoken near it echo strangely, as though some other mouth repeats them with a voice just slightly…

…behind my own. It listens. I have seen vines grow in spirals that mimic the shapes I later found—

I am watched. I am used. I have tried all rites known to me. Salt, fire, the blessing of the ground, the breaking of stone. It returns. It always returns.

…I dare not speak of this to the bishop. Let them think me mad. Perhaps I am. But if you are reading this—if this letter still breathes in your hands—then it is not yet satisfied. It waits. Do not trace its paths. Do not name it. And above all—

Fr. Elias

I read the letter once. Then again. Then again. I tried not to assign meaning to the parts I couldn’t read, but that only made them louder. I filled in gaps with instinct, with memory, with my own thoughts. I didn’t write anything down, but I started repeating certain phrases in my head, over and over: It is not haunted. It listens. Do not name it.

At first I told myself it was historical context—just context, that’s all. But I knew better. I felt better. This wasn't a coincidence. This wasn’t superstition. The priest had seen the vines too. He’d felt that same wrong warmth. He’d drawn something, or dreamed something, or spoken words that didn’t sound like his own.

And now he’s gone. Just a cracked letter, buried in the wrong box, misfiled in the basement of a library where no one ever looked. I laid it out beside my maps. The ones I’d drawn. I looked at the spirals again. I didn’t remember drawing them either—not consciously—but there they were, repeating across three separate pages. The lines converged near the well, but more than that… they grew. Each time, the spirals were longer. Thicker. As if they were spreading.

I pulled the light closer and started sketching again. Carefully. No ruler, no measuring. Just my hand. It felt natural. Almost like copying.

When I blinked, it was almost dark. I hadn’t eaten. My phone buzzed—four unread texts, missed call, low battery. I didn’t answer. I barely registered the names. Instead, I turned the priest’s letter over. Nothing written. But the paper was warped, stained in one corner like it had been held too tightly in a damp palm. I touched the spot. Cold.

That night, I dreamt of the well. But not like before—not a memory. Not something I could rationalize later as a reconstruction. The dream was inside the well. There was no light, no ground, no sky. Just slow movement, like being suspended in something thick, something not water. Something that labored up and down in a near perfect rhythm. Then, a voice—not loud, not sharp. A whisper, just near the edge of my ear, as though it were spoken from within me.

“It’s waiting for you.”

The morning after the dream, I found a crack in the living room wall. It started near the ceiling and curved downward—not jagged, not haphazard. It curled. A wide, deliberate arc, looping once like something hand-drawn. Like something I’d drawn. I didn’t touch it. I didn’t even go near it. Just stared at the shape for a while, half expecting it to keep growing right in front of me. When I blinked and looked again, it was just a crack. Drywall split from heat or pressure or old age. But I could swear it hadn’t been there the day before. I could swear it was growing.

I got a pencil and sketched the shape in my notebook. That was the first entry. By the end of the week, I had filled four pages with notes. Strange sights, small sounds, shapes that reappeared in places they didn’t belong.

There was a vine outside the bathroom window, coiled in the same spiral I’d drawn on one of the maps. Dust gathered in the corner of the kitchen that looked—if I stared too long—like the shape of a mouth.

A floorboard near the hallway seemed to pulse, just slightly, like something was breathing under it. Sometimes I felt it at night when I walked barefoot to the kitchen. The house began creaking at odd hours, but never the usual kind—this wasn’t the random shift of old wood in heat. This was rhythmic. Intentional. Like footsteps or a slow drag of something heavy just beneath the floor.

I started writing down everything. Not because I thought it would help me understand, but because I was afraid that if I didn’t, I’d start forgetting what was real. Some nights I’d wake up not knowing if the dream had ended. Other times I’d be completely awake and hear things I couldn’t place. Low, scraping sounds like something was clawing at the pipes.

The voice came back too. Always in dreams at first. A woman’s voice—soft, urgent, whispering close enough that I felt the warmth of breath on the back of my neck. She said things like “deeper,” or “closer,” or “you’ve already seen it.” She never shouted. She never begged. Just said those things again and again until I woke up soaked in sweat, heart pounding, unsure whether I’d screamed.

Eventually, I stopped trying to sleep. The cracks were in every room now. Most were small, just hairline fractures, but some had started curling into distinct shapes. Spirals, mostly.

I measured a few of them and compared them to the ones I’d drawn in my earliest sketches. They matched exactly—same size, same curve, even the same direction. That shouldn’t have been possible. I hadn’t used a compass or ruler for any of them. They were just instinctive drawings. But something about them was being mirrored in the house itself.

Sometimes I could hear the voice during the day too, not just in dreams. Whispered just low enough that I couldn’t catch every word. I wrote those down too. Sometimes just fragments: “It’s hungry,” “We remember,” “You’re close,” “He failed,” and once, just once, “Don’t leave.”

One night while going through the pages again, I remembered something from the archive box. Buried beneath the priest’s letter and the church logs, there had been a bundle of handwritten sermon drafts—most of them incomprehensible—but one of them had a different handwriting and included diagrams.

Badly drawn circles, strange patterns, and Latin phrases scribbled in the margins. At the time I’d dismissed it as nonsense, but now I found myself digging through the pile to find it again. And when I did, I realized it wasn’t just a sermon. It was something else.

The handwriting matched the priest’s signature from the letter—Fr. Elias Grange. A final note from him, possibly unfinished. One page near the end had been marked with a faint ink circle and the words “Counter-Circle” underlined three times.

There were references to a ritual—elements of protection, maybe. It wasn’t clear. The Latin was fragmented, and the diagrams seemed incomplete. But I pieced together enough to try it.

I waited until night. Cleared the living room, pushed the furniture to the edges, and chalked the rough shape of the circle onto the floor. I placed salt where the lines met, as best I could make sense of it. I read the incantation aloud, quietly at first, then louder. My voice cracked during the third repetition. By the end of it, my vision had gone blurry and my hands were shaking. I felt like I was on the verge of throwing up.

But then—nothing happened. The room stayed still. No whispers. No cracking walls. No strange movements in the shadows. I sat there for hours, waiting for something to shift. Nothing did. It was the first quiet I’d experienced in days. That night I slept straight through. No dreams. No voice. Just sleep.

The next morning I found blood in the bathroom sink. It was faint—almost diluted—but real. I checked myself over. No cuts. No dried blood in my mouth. The drain wasn’t rusted. It wasn’t some old residue. It was fresh. I turned the tap on and watched it swirl down.

When I stepped outside, I noticed something I hadn’t before. Every house on the street—every single one—had a vine growing near the base. Most people probably wouldn’t have noticed it. Just one thin strand curling around a pipe or sprouting from a crack in the driveway. But I looked closer. They all curved the same way. All spiraled in the same direction.

I opened my notebook and flipped back through the pages. My earliest maps had started warping. The ink was thicker now. The spirals are darker, fuller. The paper almost felt damp in some places, like the lines were still alive. Still growing. Even the ones I hadn’t touched were changing, reshaping themselves slightly when I looked away. The lines were converging on something. A center point I already knew. The priest’s letter said it always returns. He tried fire, salt, and prayer. All of it failed. His letter had survived. But he hadn’t.

That evening, while I sat at the kitchen table, I heard the voice again. This time I was fully awake. It didn’t come from a dream, and it wasn’t outside. It was in the room with me, just behind my ear. No warmth this time. No breath.

“Why would you do that?” Then silence.

But I could feel something beneath the house. Something scraping from underneath the floor boards. It wasn’t scraping the flooring though—the sound was coming from deeper in the earth. It sounded like grinding. Like two pieces of iron scraping against each other.

I packed a bag. The letter. My notes. A flashlight. A map. I took matches. A knife. A jar of salt. I don’t know what I thought I’d need. But I knew staying here was no longer an option. The lines were crawling toward me now, not outward. Inward. Always toward where I stood. The spirals in my drawings had started looping into themselves like they were folding reality.

The well had been whispering. Now it was listening. And whatever was at the bottom was finally awake. I was going back. I had to. Not to stop it. I don’t know if that’s even possible. But I had to see it. I had to know what it wanted. Because I think it’s always known what I am. And it’s been waiting.

By the time I left the house and followed the path back toward the clearing, I could feel the air thickening like a fever pressing against my skin. Every branch seemed bent in slight curves, the fallen needles arranged in arcs I hadn’t noticed before, as though the forest itself had been folding itself into spirals while no one was watching.

My eyes refused to stay still; whenever I focused on one tree, the others seemed to bow inward, their shadows stretching like grasping fingers. Somewhere behind me, low and almost swallowed by the wind, came the faint sound of my own breath repeating a half-beat later, too late to be an echo.

When I broke through the pines, the clearing felt wrong—emptier than it had any right to be—but Seth was already standing there near the well, his hands shoved deep into his pockets, his shoulders set like stone. He’d been waiting.

He didn’t shout at me. He didn’t even greet me. He just said my name flatly, like the word itself was a sentence, and I realized he knew. He must have seen the way I carried myself, the duffel strap biting into my shoulder, the way I avoided looking at the stones ringing the mouth.

“You’re not done with this,” he said, and there was a tired fury in his voice that told me he had rehearsed this confrontation, maybe pacing his house the night before, maybe staring into the mirror trying to find the words.

I told him everything. I don’t even know why, except that I was too far gone to stop myself. I told him about the spirals, the voices, the thing beneath the well that listened when I thought too hard, the dreams of the woman’s whisper curling behind my ear. I confessed it all with the kind of certainty you only hear in lunatics and prophets.

Seth stood with his jaw locked, shaking his head every few sentences like he was trying to keep his footing on ground that wouldn’t stop shifting. He didn’t believe me. He told me it was stress, sleep deprivation, that I had always been obsessive and this was just another spiral of my own making. But when I asked him if he’d seen the cracks in the trees, if he’d noticed the way the clearing bent around the well, he went silent too long, and I knew he had.

I begged him for help. I told him I couldn’t do it alone, that I needed rope, that I needed someone at the surface to anchor me. He swore at me under his breath, called me insane, and said this was going to end in an accident that would ruin us both.

But when I started toward the well without waiting for him, he grabbed my shoulder hard enough to leave a bruise and said fine, fine, but we do this my way. We went back to his house and gathered rope, an old coil he used for deer blinds, still smelling faintly of mildew and pine sap.

Neither of us spoke much on the walk back; the trees seemed to lean closer, the wind still carrying that faint offbeat echo of my breathing. When we returned to the clearing, Seth tested the rope, knotting it against the trunk of a pine, tugging it twice as if to reassure himself this was still just physical, just real.

He looped the other end around my waist with a grim efficiency, his face pale but determined. Then he braced himself by the stone lip and said, “Go. But if you tug twice, I’m pulling you up, whether you like it or not.” I nodded, though I already knew there would be no pulling me back once I saw what lay beneath.

I lowered myself into the well slowly, the stones cold and slick under my palms, the rope creaking faintly with each shift of weight. The circle of daylight above shrank too quickly, and the air carried with it the stench of wet copper, the rot of something animal left in the humid heat.

I could feel it breathing down there, though no air stirred. My hands began to tremble as my boots slid against the wall, not stone anymore but something softer, with just enough give to make me recoil. I told myself it was moss, just moss. But when I pressed too hard, the wall quivered, and a thin tremor rippled through the shaft as though the well itself had flinched.

The rope hissed against the stone lip above as I went lower, my fingers slick now with whatever clung to the walls. It wasn’t moss. The texture was wrong—too warm, too pliant, like wet skin stretched thin over bone. When I brushed against it with my knuckles, it flexed away and then settled back, pulsing faintly as though veins carried something through it in waves.

Seth’s voice drifted down from above, asking if I was all right, but it sounded muffled, like he was speaking through cloth, and I couldn’t bring myself to answer. The stench grew thicker the deeper I went, acrid and sweet, the reek of spoiled meat undercut with something medicinal, like iodine. Each breath coated my throat until I could almost taste iron on my tongue.

The shaft widened slightly, and the daylight above seemed farther away than it should have been, a distant white coin dissolving into shadow. I steadied myself on the wall, but when my palm flattened against it, the surface was no longer just damp—it was slick, with a mucous sheen that smeared across my skin in strands.

I almost let go of the rope when something shifted under my hand, a slow ripple moving outward from where I touched, as if the well’s insides were listening. The silence below was total, so heavy I could hear my own pulse in my ears, but threaded through it came a faint susurrus, not wind, not water, but whispering too low to separate into words.

I made the mistake of looking down. The dark was alive with faint glimmers, tiny reflective surfaces like wet eyes catching what little light bled from above. They were embedded in the walls, opening and closing as though they were lids, twitching in the rhythm of breath.

For a moment I couldn’t move, my body locked in place between the rope’s pull above and the living shaft below. That’s when I felt the first brush against my ankle, light as spider silk. I jerked upward, banging my elbow against the stone, but the touch didn’t stop. It was followed by another, and then another, until strands like roots or tendrils were questing upward out of the black, curling around my boots, tasting at the hem of my jeans.

I shouted, finally, wordless and strangled, and Seth hauled on the rope from above, his voice echoing down sharp and panicked. I scrambled upward, trying to kick free, but the tendrils were stronger than they looked. They wound tighter, dragging at my legs, their texture not plant-like at all but more like cords of muscle slicked with bile.

I clawed at them, ripping one free only to feel another coil higher, tightening around my calf. The rope strained under the sudden jerks of Seth pulling, each heave wrenching me upward a foot at a time, but the things were climbing faster. They didn’t want me alone.

Then the rope above lurched, slackened, and screamed against the stone. I twisted to look, heart clamping in my chest, and saw Seth’s silhouette at the rim, his body bent forward as he braced himself. Something had reached him. One of the black tendrils, thick as a wrist, had whipped out from the well’s edge and lashed around his arm.

His shout cracked the silence as he tried to wrench free, but three more followed, snapping around his shoulders, his chest, his throat. He dropped the rope and clawed at them, but they dragged him forward with impossible force. I saw his hands scrabble at the stone lip, nails tearing bloody grooves as he was yanked downward into the dark. His scream lasted only until the tendrils pulled him past the opening, and then it cut off, swallowed whole.

The last thing I felt before the rope jerked me upward again was the slack where his strength had been, replaced by a shudder from the well itself, a tremor that rattled through the living walls and into my bones. I climbed blindly, sobbing, slipping on the slick surface, hauling myself hand over hand with raw palms until the circle of daylight grew larger. When I finally rolled over the lip onto the dirt, gasping, the clearing was silent. The rope lay coiled uselessly beside me, twitching once as though something below had given it a final tug.

I don’t remember how long I lay on the ground beside the well, my chest heaving and my face wet with tears I didn’t even feel coming. The clearing swayed around me, every tree leaning closer as though to look at what had been taken, and I clawed at the dirt like an upset toddler, whispering Seth’s name until my throat tore raw.

At some point instinct drove me stumbling into the woods, my hands cut and tore open as I bumbled through miles of sharp branches and pinecones, my legs giving out every few yards until I crawled through pine needles and mud. I could still feel the rope around my waist, slick with the filth of the shaft, and I tore it off, hurling it into the underbrush as if distance could undo what had happened. I don’t remember finding my way home, only that I woke in my bed the next morning with my mother’s voice calling the police because Seth hadn’t come home.

The search lasted days. Flashlights swept the woods at night, dogs bayed and strained at their leashes, and the well stood quietly among the pines, rope still tied neat to the trunk where Seth had anchored it. I stood beside the officers as they peered down into the dark, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would echo into the shaft and wake whatever was listening.

They lowered lights, even a camera on a cable, but the footage showed only slick walls and dripping stone. No flesh, no eyes, no tendrils. They found no trace of Seth, no blood, no torn clothing, nothing. I gave my statement—how we had gone walking, how Seth had gone ahead, how I had turned and he was gone.

They asked me if he’d been drinking, if he’d seemed tired. I told them he had slipped. I told them he had fallen into the well.

They lowered more rope, shouting his name into the black, but it returned nothing but hollow echoes. In the end they wrote it up as an accident, a tragic misstep in the dark woods, the kind of story you tell yourself to sleep at night.

His family never forgave me. My own mother stopped meeting my eyes at the dinner table, as if she knew I was keeping something back but couldn’t bear to ask. The town whispered. I carried the weight in silence, night after night, until even my dreams grew too heavy to bear.

Now I am twenty-five. Eight years have passed since that night, and I am writing this because I can no longer pretend. I’ve lived with the guilt until it hollowed me out, until I see Seth’s hands clawing at the stone every time I close my eyes. I know the well is still there, patient and breathing, and I know it is not done with me.",1,1762993127.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I don’t have the emotional energy to get more detailed than I am here. 

The backstory: 

my (28F) ex (32M) told me he was polyamorous when I was 2 months postpartum. I was a stay-at-home-mom to our newborn, he was working ~60h a week. Over the summer he kept pushing for polyamory, and eventually told me he was going to do it whether I like it or not. He wanted me to be poly too so I could find someone to help me raise our child. I agreed to open the relationship last September which is when he met Ally (fake name) (~34F) on a poly dating site. I told him I didn’t want our relationship to be open anymore because it was making me sick, and wanted to take the baby to my parents house. He threatened to file for sole custody if I did that. So I stayed. He told me he wasn’t seeing anyone, but was still talking to Ally as a friend. 

Once I finally left him this past July he told me he wasn’t seeing anyone romantically at all. A month or so later I brought up some boundaries I’d like to have regarding potential new partners and our child, those being they can’t meet our kid for at least 6 months, can’t come to this next birthday party, and the other parent has to meet them first. He asked what to do if we start dating someone our child has already met. My head starts spinning trying to think of any single people we know, when he informs me he’s already introduced our child to Ally. Twice.

A month ago he wasn’t dating anyone. He then informs me that they’ve been seeing each other again for “a few months”… meaning before I left him when we were presumably in a closed relationship again. I’m seething on the inside. What kind of person just meets someone’s kid in this situation? This woman knows I am/was his wife. She probably knows I left him, or at least that we’re no longer together. That’s just fucking weird. And my ex is a big fat fucking liar, but that’s not surprising anymore. 

So I say I need to meet her. He tells me she has a lot of respect for me, thinks I’m great, that she really likes our kid and would never do anything to hurt her. All weird things to say. So I say that’s great, we should meet. He then starts going back, saying he doesn’t want us to meet alone, that it’s not appropriate, that I can’t control who he sees and what he does either by himself or with our child. 

Anyway, today I found her Instagram. It wasn’t hard, she’s the only Ally following him whom he also follows back. I tell her I’d like to meet her, as she has met my child, and that I didn’t know if my ex had said anything to her yet or not about it, but it had been a few months and I don’t like waiting around for these things.

She responds that she’d love to get coffee with me, and wishes me luck with my classes (I’m finishing a bachelors program before I start a masters next fall). Which is weird to me that she knows so much about me while I know nothing about her. 

I want to meet her one on one because I want to know what kind of person she is and how much my ex has been lying to her, but I’m also really scared of my ex and any conversation without a paper trail or record. 

He’s been trying to plant the seeds that I’m mentally/emotionally unstable since before I left him, and has been gaslighting and manipulating me since at least the birth of our child if not before. I’m in the process of getting a divorce lawyer, I have one I want to work with, but have not yet retained her due to finances. She told me that from his abusive behavior she thinks I need representation to protect myself, and is reaching out to other lawyer friends of hers that are less expensive and do pro-bono work.

I also feel so tangled up. This woman is also potentially a victim of my ex’s lies, but she can’t be stupid enough to not see this situation for what it was/is. A man seeking a new partner with a 6 month old at home? Unbelievable. I know she doesn’t have kids, but you can’t be that dense. She has played a role in the betrayal I suffered this past year, and I can’t not be man and hate her a little for that. But I don’t want to jeopardize things with my child as I move towards actually divorcing their dad. But I need to meet this woman who either is or will potentially play a step-parent role in their life, and my ex doesn’t seem to think this is a big deal.

Tl;Dr: my ex informed me he was polyamorous 2 months postpartum. Started dating a woman 6 months postpartum. Said he stopped seeing her, but was still texting he and started seeing her romantically before I left him. He lied to me about being single and then introduced her to our child and tried to hide it from me. He has not been cooperative in facilitating her and I meeting, and is vehemently against it. I found her Instagram and messaged her, and she said she’d like to meet.

What are some steps I can take to both protect myself and get the story out of this woman as to what she knows and what my ex has told her? I don’t want to chew her out (I do, but it’s not productive), but I also don’t want let her think she hasn’t played into the abandonment and betrayal I’ve been subjected to.",1,1762992788.0,relationships,9,0.56,False

1ovm4zz,https://i.redd.it/am1v5dyr1x0g1.png,Short Narrative: The Accident Magnet,"There are people who attract good fortune, people who attract attention, and then there’s **Harvey Wink** — a man who attracts *accidents*. Not the heroic kind where he saves kittens from burning houses, but the kind that makes insurance companies hold meetings about him.

It began on a bright Saturday morning at *Sunny Grocer Market*, where Harvey decided to “manifest a calm, normal day.” He even repeated his new mantra in the bathroom’s mirror: “No chaos today.” The mirror cracked slightly at the corner. He turned around and left. He was glad no one was near.

In the produce section, Harvey admired a proud display of tomatoes — shiny, firm, vibrant. “Let’s find a good one,” he murmured, gently squeezing a tomato.

*SPLAT!*

Juice exploded in his hand, spraying onto a woman’s cream-coloured blouse. She froze, horrified, as a red streak ran down her front.

“MY DRESS!” she shrieked.

Her husband, built like a refrigerator with emotions, stormed over. “You think this is funny?”

“I swear it was an accident!” Harvey said. Ten seconds later, he was apologizing profusely, covered in pulp, and paying eighty bucks for dry cleaning and “trauma.”

Once they left, Harvey sighed. “At least that’s over.”

He turned around and reached for an apple — the one apple at the *very bottom* of a perfect pyramid.

*Thud. Roll. Roll. ROLL!*

Forty apples or so cascaded down like an edible avalanche. People slipped, carts collided, a yogourt display went flying. Harvey didn’t wait around for security; he sprinted out of the store like his life depended on it.

In the parking lot, he dove into his car, trembling. “Just go home,” he told himself. “Breathe. Drive.”

He reversed. *CRUNCH!*

His heart sank. The car he hit belonged — of course — to the same tomato husband.

The man turned, his face turning beet-red (which matched Harvey’s hands nicely), and charged. Harvey locked his doors, fumbling for his phone as he called 911.

Ten minutes later, police arrived, IDs were checked — and apparently, there was a **warrant** for Harvey’s arrest.

“What?! I don’t even jaywalk!”

“Unpaid tickets and a missed court date,” said the officer.

Within the hour, Harvey sat in a holding cell between two large men comparing tattoos that may or may not have been autobiographical. Just when he thought it couldn’t get worse, an officer appeared.

“Hey, you’re free to go. Typo in our system. You’re *Harvey Wink*, not *Harvey Winks.*”

“One letter saved my life,” Harvey muttered as they released him.

Outside the station, a calm, smiling man on a bench looked up. “Rough day?”

“You could say that,” Harvey sighed.

“I used to be like you,” the man said. “Every day, something went wrong. Then I realized — you don’t attract bad luck, you expect it. Change your thoughts, you change your life.”

Harvey nodded slowly. “I think you’re right.”

He smiled for the first time that day, feeling light, almost lucky. As he stepped off the curb, he looked up at the sky, watching a pigeon fly peacefully overhead.

Then — *SCREECH!*

A car slammed its brakes. Harvey froze mid-step, but his foot didn’t make it. The car bumped him just hard enough to send him spinning onto the sidewalk.

**Final Ending – With Writer’s Comment**

Harvey sat in the hospital bed, leg in a bright blue cast, surrounded by “Get Well Soon” balloons — one reading *“Stay Positive!”* and another, ironically, shaped like a tomato.

He smiled faintly. “Guess for some of us, it just takes a little longer.”

A nurse passed by, stepped on a stray grape, and barely caught herself on the edge of his bed. Harvey closed his eyes.

“...Make that *a lot* longer,” he muttered.

With AI, Robotics and automation accelerating so quickly there will come a time when the incentives and means to wipe out the 90% of humanity that are redundant will become too immense to ignore.

87% of the world lives outside developed nations.  Few give a second thought about these people beyond the fact we've needed them for our coffee, our cocoa, for cheap clothes, and other things. 

But what if the people are no longer required?  What if via AI and Robotics they can build economies that will consume?  What if they become competitors for the limited resources?   

Tariffs and expelling immigrants is just the beginning of inhumanity.

We must embrace these hard truths and realize the real risks they pose and stop distracting each other with fantasies of **'killer robots'.**  

**If everything is a catastrophe, nothing is.**

It is not inevitable though.  We can start thinking of ways to do productive automation without devaluing humans and ensuring they are not redundant.  We can ensure that automation does not outpace efficient resource utilization by tracking commodity prices.

There are many things we can do.  But the worst thing would be pretending it won't happen.

Ah, the joys of teaching Italian! I remember the first time I introduced *relative pronouns* to my students. Their eyes widened like deer caught in headlights. I reassured them, ""Don't worry, it's easier than it looks!"" Let's dive into the world of these handy little words.

**Why relative pronouns matter**

Relative pronouns are like the duct tape of language—they hold sentences together. They link parts of a sentence, making your speech smoother than a scoop of gelato on a hot day. Here's a quick rundown:

- **Che**: This is your go-to word, like your favorite pizza topping. It means ""who,"" ""which,"" or ""that."" It's versatile and never changes, so you can use it for people, things, or ideas.
- **Cui**: Think of *cui* as the sidekick that needs a preposition to shine. It's used for ""whom,"" ""which,"" or ""that,"" and often indicates possession or relationships.
- **Il quale**: This one's the formal suit in your closet—used less often but perfect for special occasions. It changes with gender and number, so keep an eye on that!

**Real-life scenarios**

Picture this: You're at a café in Rome, and you say, ""Questo è il caffè *che* adoro!"" (This is the coffee *that* I love!). Or maybe you're reminiscing about a friend, ""L'amico *con cui* ho viaggiato"" (The friend *with whom* I traveled).

**Tips for success**

- **Identify the antecedent**: Know which noun your pronoun is referring to.
- **Master prepositions**: Especially when using *cui*.
- **Match gender and number**: When using *il quale*.

I (28m) have been talking to her (25f) for just over 2½ months. I've been single for two years, she got out of a two year relationship in June, so five months now. She told me in the beginning, that she wasn't ready to date and wanted to be single for awhile. Which I knew and respected, however we talk everyday, some phone calls lasting hours, we've been on 2 dates already, a 3rd one is planned next week.

I'm just a bit confused, I know she's talking to two other people. She has realistic standards that weren't met in her last relationship, so she's looking around to make sure she finds someone that'll meet them. We've talked, we both have similar goals and expectations in a relationship want many of the same things, all the bells and whistles.

However, she's stated that she wants to be single/alone for awhile, but she's talking to three people. She doesn't want to date, but we're going on our 3rd, and I know she's been on a date with another.

I'm absolutely head over heels for here, I gifted her, her first ever flowers. Took her on a date to a play, that she wanted to see, that she even forgot about, and assumed I did. I send her lunches and coffee ever know and again because she forgets to eat. I validate her every moment I can, we ask each other deep personal question all the time. I even asked her what the most romantic things someone has done for her, and she stated the play and me sending her food, was the best example.

I completely told her my interest in her, and my intent to date her, to marriage, she dates for marriage as well. I'm just confused on what I should do.",1,1762992001.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

My boyfriend and I (both 29) are moving to Richmond and are looking for a place to rent. We have a golden doodle and a cat, so pet-friendly is a must. We’re both very active, love going out to try new bars and restaurants, and enjoy being outdoors (runs, biking, pickleball, river walks, etc.).

We’ve been looking at a few places so far:

* **The Otis (Scott’s Addition):** Trendy area, lots of breweries and restaurants within walking distance. Looks very modern and walkable.
* **The Westbrook at Brewers Row:** Newer/resort-style apartments with a lot of amenities and dog-friendly features.
* **Jamestown Flats:** Near the James River, so great for outdoor activities and river access, with modern amenities.
* **The Novel (Scott’s Addition):** Modern apartments, looks nice online, but when I drove by, the location didn’t feel very walkable or super appealing outside of the building itself. Not sure it would be convenient for going out or grabbing coffee/food without driving.

We’re curious if anyone has experience living in these complexes or can recommend other apartments in similar areas that are pet-friendly, modern, and convenient to both outdoor activities and Richmond’s food/drink scene.

Any thoughts, advice, or personal experiences would be super helpful — especially if you’ve lived somewhere you’d actually recommend for an active couple with pets!

⚠️ Trigger Warning

This is the recap of the monetized posts from Kylea and Joseph ""Joe"" Gomez of Kylea G, You Grow Girl from 10/22/25-10/28/25.

Disclaimers: I am not a physician, influencer, or paid content creator.  I am not affiliated with WW.  I have no background in law; however, I am semi-retired from the healthcare field with multiple college degrees.  These opinions are my own based on social media content.  I wish no harm to Kylea & Joe Gomez or Kylea's legal team.

👋 everyone!  Let's take a peek into Kylea's ""busy"" schedule and latest complaints.  

⏸️ Please note she only posted a Facebook Story on 10/26/25, leading many to suspect she was restricted from making posts.

10/27 Reminded followers via a Facebook Story she saw Gary LeVox in concert in IN 2 years ago today

Pets, Family & Religion

10/22 Birdie and Oliver shown cuddling Kylea on the couch; Kylea became frustrated and ""almost in tears"" explaining that Alice is shy

10/23 Oliver shown asleep on the spare bed; Her little sister is arriving from TN today and will be home 11 days to celebrate her birthday.  They will have Hibachi, confetti cake and white chocolate covered strawberries next weekend to celebrate

10/24 Birdie shown in her bumble bee costume; Selfie of Kylea & her Mama in the apartment kitchen

10/25 Long comments posted about Birdie's pica, if there is 1 snag in a dog toy it's thrown away, and the Christmas tree must be in the spare bedroom to keep her safe; Kylea clarified her sister has been working 1.5 hours away, so she drove to visit her at work for 5 minutes.  Her sister works until Sunday then has time to visit with family and many friends

10/26 Kylea slept in today and didn't attend church. She made chicken taco soup for her sister

10/27 Birdie is the reason Kylea's still alive.  She's closed her Messenger due to bullying.

*No video content was posted of Birdie on a walk or playing with her puzzles/ball pit.  The black cat, Alice, was not shown in images or on video and there were ZERO posts dedicated to her. 😔 

Health & Fitness: 🤪  

10/22 Kylea can only watch 5-10 minutes of TV before becoming bored.  She's only watched a few movies in the last few years; She had heart attack & stroke level b/p in 2021 and changed her life to be around for her family; She closed her Messenger due to UNkind comments; After claiming she has 2 full loads of dishes per day, she showed her loaded dishwasher. ⏸️ IMO, it was poorly loaded.

10/23 She barely slept this week preparing for her sister to visit

10/24 She admitted she barely had any dessert with sugar for the first 1.5 years of her journey and those items were not allowed in her home

10/25 Little Debbie clapback Facebook Story; She snapped at and trauma dumped on a follower who asked about taking Birdie inside stores; She doesn't count WW points for spray butter; She feels she works hard moving her shopping cart around to avoid glare while photographing retail items

10/28 She won't tolerate others telling her how to eat.  Her home is fully stocked at all times, so she can take care of her family.  They are always doing kind things for others; She is not worried about her loose skin; Due to her OCD, she prefers even numbers (i.e. the thermostat and TV volume) just like her dad; She doesn't count WW points for applesauce even though it is 2 points in the app. 

*No videos of Joe at the gym were shared; no walking pad content was shared; no content was shared on Facebook showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate.

Final Thoughts

Kylea sure knows how to treat herself, although she claims they do more for others than themselves. 😇  She hyped up this visit with her little sister...which so far is a bust. Claiming a dog is the reason you are alive, instead of your faith, spouse, or family sends up big red flags.  That's a topic to discuss in therapy ASAP. ✌️ 

☎️ If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, please call or text 988 for assistance.  Please speak with a medical professional about any questions or concerns you have about your health.  Please contact a veterinarian about any questions or concerns you have about your pet(s).

I left a hospital job after severe burnout and moved back home. I thought I’d take a short break and find something better, but months have passed and I still can’t land another job. Every rejection makes me feel like I’ve ruined my career before it really started.

I’m still a virgin and have never even been on a date. I want to experience sex, love, and connection but at this point, I don’t even know where to start. It feels humiliating to be this old and this inexperienced. The dating apps can't even get a match. Considering going on there and offering money for one coffee date.

I’ve gained a lot of weight over the years and it’s only added to the shame. I’m dieting now, going to the gym, and trying to get my health back, but it’s slow and discouraging. I am 5'6 280lbs and so if I lose weight I will look even uglier with loose skin.

I’m also trying to rebuild: I’m in therapy, I saw a career coach (who honestly wasn’t very encouraging), and I’m doing my best to fix my habits. But I feel paralyzed. Every step forward feels like it’s too late to matter.

I want to move out again, travel, live a real life  but I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve messed up too much to catch up.

1ovlpmy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovlpmy,Added the Ground Sense Pro,"Added the Fiorenzato Ground Sense Pro to serve as my main grinder and moved the Libra to decaf duties. I started getting annoyed with the Libra every time I did a deep cleaning I lost screws and had to fish them out. Similar to when you lose a guitar pick in an acoustic guitar it never comes out as easily as you think. It seems to always be an exercise in frustration once you disassemble the burrs and a lot of coffee is wasted getting it back to where you need to. 

I was impressed with how the GSP seemed to be so easy to get into and the versatility was a draw as well. The set points are always consistent, compared to the Libra it grinds 18g in what almost feels like an instant. I think the Libra is a great grinder in terms of the output quality, but the GSP is definitely so much easier to just work with and maintain.

I work from home and have multiple customers/co-workers over daily and make about 5-10 cups a day. This helps keep all my guests happy and caffeinated or not as they choose. Highly recommend this grinder. ",4,1762991451.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1ovlohs,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1ovlohs/seattle_hyatts_grand_hyatt_olive_8_and_thompson/,"Seattle Hyatts: Grand Hyatt, Olive 8 and Thompson","Seattle doesn't really have great high end hotels. I am not a fan of the Four Seasons Seattle, so I thought I would cover the higher end Hyatt's in the city.  These Hyatts land in the chubby pricing tier during the summer when Seattle rates go through the roof, and in the winter, everything in Seattle is cheap.

Over the last several months I’ve stayed at Grand Hyatt (5×), Olive 8 (2×), and Thompson (1×).

Disclosure: I’m biased against the weather and the service culture in Seattle.

**Grand Hyatt Seattle**

I’ve stayed in the Sound View room twice, the corner room twice, and the club room once. This hotel is good about upgrading you to a view if one is available, and the Sound View really does have a great view of the water from mid-city. I’d recommend it if you’re in town during the six weeks of good weather.

This is one of the older “nice” hotels in Seattle, which comes with pros and cons. On the positive side, the rooms are generally bigger, many bathrooms have full tubs, the elevator-to-floor ratio is good, and the bathroom lighting is the best of the three Hyatts. It might also be the quietest—excellent blackout curtains, and if you flip or cover the alarm clock, there’s no light pollution. Really nice business hotel.

The corner rooms are almost suites, there is a short hallway between the living room and the bedroom, but because of the building’s orientation, they don’t have Sound views. My wife liked the space—it’s large enough that I’m out of the way while she gets ready—but otherwise it’s not an impressive room. For her birthday I booked this room with Alex for the extra space (suites were sold out). The hotel handled the occasion well: recognition at check-in, chocolate-covered cherries, a card, and in-room cake and beverages from Alex. Nicely done for a convention-focused property.

There’s nothing special about the club room; it just has lounge access. Since it’s on the higher floors where the building narrows, there’s no tub—actually great for me, because the shower is twice the size. Showers in regular rooms could be larger. I didn’t use the lounge; I can expense breakfast, and Anchorhead is around the corner.

Service: meh. The front desk is efficient. The doorman has held the door maybe twice in 30–40 entries, and reaching the front desk by phone is nearly impossible because calls route through Hyatt’s central switchboard.

Amenities: Balmain soaps don’t offend me and my wife travels with a complete Sephora. Coffee and tea setup is Keurig and the options are bad. The gym is acceptable. Restaurants and bar in the hotel are not great, but you’re a couple blocks from good to great choices. No idea if there’s even a spa. There’s a Moët vending machine in the lobby—so definitely chubby.

**Hyatt at Olive 8**

The Olive 8 and the Grand are managed by the same group, so service and experience are similar. This hotel also focuses on conventions. Olive 8 is a “lower-end” hotel than the Grand: one restaurant and a bagel shop in the lobby. The building is shared with Olive 8 residences (separate entrance around the corner), and the gym and pool are shared—which is a plus. The gym is much better; the pool is roughly 22 yards and set up for laps; there’s a giant hot tub plus steam room and sauna in the locker rooms.

I think the residences get the good views. I’ve never had a view room here, even though the building should offer some Sound and plenty of South Lake Union views—so maybe I’m not important enough. The only upgrade I’ve gotten is to the “quiet floor,” which means no kids and white-noise machines. This hotel defaults to connecting rooms, so I’ve had noisy neighbors more than once. Service feels the same; the corporate rep often covers both hotels. The tea and coffee were recently downgraded to the same weak Keurig setup as the Grand.

**Thompson Seattle**

I wanted to like this hotel—it’s just not for me. It’s for the nightlife crowd, and that’s obvious the moment you walk in, even more so in the room. I walked into the bathroom and thought, this is what my bathroom would look like if I were a DJ. If you want to do makeup in that bathroom, bring your own lighting. It was bright enough for me to shave without losing part of my face. There’s a lit magnifying mirror that might help.

The minibar is fully stocked—really stocked: wines, hard liquor, mixers, sodas, juices, chocolates, chips, cookies, jerky, nuts…basically a mini-mart. Again, plays to the party vibe.  The coffee tea setup was good.  There are two pour over packet things (Copper Cow Pour Over) that actually made strong tasty coffee, real coffee cups and the kettle had 1 degree adjustments, for those that can remember when tea should be brewed at 180F before actually having caffeine.  The coffee mini bar setup will be a selling feature for some.

The location across the street from Pike Place Market. The rooftop bar is a popular spot for drinks. The restaurant isn’t really a local draw but is small enough to look full, usually with guests. You’re within easy walking distance of a high concentration of bars, so they nailed the vibe and there plenty of places to eat nearby.

Rooms: newer hotel means smaller rooms and weaker sound insulation. The bathroom is dim but decently sized. The bedroom is well organized but close to crowded.  The entry level room would be crowded for two when getting ready.

The nightlife atmosphere doesn’t bother me—it’s just not my vibe and wouldn’t alone keep me away. The light pollution would. If the AC is on, the entire room glows blue, and the light strip is about six inches below the ceiling, making it hard to block.  There are 3 other devices that glow at night that needed to be covered or unplugged, and yes, they all face the bed. Street noise is hit or miss; I’m pretty sure a car was towed at 4 a.m., and there was no sleeping through it.

I wanted to like the Thompson for two reasons: when I’m in town for work, there are plenty of dining options nearby, and when I’m in town for vacation, the Studio Suites and above look genuinely nice.  I won't be back.",6,1762991371.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

The story is a mix of mystery, and romance, and I’d love to know your thoughts This is Chapter 1. I plan to upload the entire story in installments, so if you like it, there will be more to come. I really appreciate any constructive criticism, both positive and negative!


Chapter 1

It all started when I walked in on my husband in our bedroom in a rather compromising position.
As for my job? It’s a nightmare. Or more precisely, my boss is. He only keeps me working overtime so he can eventually get in between my legs. But he hasn’t managed to fulfill that fantasy of his. You’re probably wondering why I still work for someone like that. Well, because of my husband. My ex-husband, to be exact. He’s in debt to the very same man, and at this point, I don’t have another option. Every miserable coin I earn through my own sweat, goes straight to his account.
You think he doesn’t know about my boss’s interest in his wife?
Oh, he knows. But he “trusts me.” He’s convinced I won’t open my legs for anyone…
God, how I hate myself for always attracting idiotic men into my life.
Anyway, where was I?
Ah yes, the scene of my husband’s affair, right?
He knew I was going to be late, but it just so happened that my boss left a dull party earlier than expected, which meant I got off work early too. I didn’t think twice. I headed straight home.

“I’m home,” I called out, kicking off those dreadful high heels with a sigh of relief. The coolness of the floor felt so good I smiled.
When my husband didn’t answer, I assumed it was another night of binge drinking. Probably passed out in some bar again. Honestly, I still can’t figure out how I ever fell in love with someone like Henry.
I was just about to head to the bedroom when I heard noises coming from inside that made me freeze in place. I stood there for just a second, paralyzed, unable to bring my trembling hand to touch the doorknob.
My heart was pounding so hard I thought I might faint.
When I heard my husband’s voice from inside the room:
“You’re unbelievable” The alarm went off in my brain.
I don’t remember how I moved after that, or how I didn’t pass out when I barged into the bedroom.
All I remember is recognizing my husband’s shoulders, his shirt unbuttoned, slipping halfway down his arms. One hand gripping the body of a woman and his other hand buried in her blonde hair, fingers tightly wrapped around her throat.
It didn’t hurt. In fact, I almost felt relieved. Relieved that I could finally throw both him and that excuse for a human being – my boss,  straight to hell.
I slammed the door shut behind me, and stared straight into Henry’s eyes.
“Shit.”
I actually felt sorry for the poor woman, caught mid-act like that.
And as my naked husband started walking toward me, I met his gaze with pure disgust.
“I can explain, Nene.”
“Get the fuck out of my house.”
When my palm started burning, I realized I had slapped him.
I don’t remember anything after that.

When I came back to my senses, I was alone, sitting at the table in nothing but my oversized T-shirt.
A few empty wine bottles lay in front of me.
My head was pounding.
There was still some alcohol left in my glass, I drank it, then blacked out again.

I have no idea how long I slept.
But when the ringing phone jolted me awake, I cursed under my breath.
Once I gathered enough energy to speak, I picked up the call.
“You’re late, Nene.”
God, how I hate that voice. That smug bastard. What else can you call a man who’s already gone through three wives, fathered six children, and is about to marry his fourth, yet still won’t stop asking me what color underwear I prefer
“I’m talking to you, Nene.”
My head throbbed harder at his shouting.
“Go fuck yourself.”
The relief I felt as I hung up on my boss was euphoric. When he called again, I turned off my phone completely. Then I dragged my alcohol-heavy body out of bed, stumbled into the bathroom, and surrendered myself to a freezing shower. The cold made me shiver even harder, but it helped clear my head.
A little more awake, I headed to the kitchen to make a strong cup of coffee.
Coffee in hand, I returned to the living room and glanced up at the wedding photo on the shelf, narrowing my eyes. I felt absolutely nothing.
I stashed the picture away in a drawer, curled up in the soft armchair, and took a noisy sip of my hot coffee.
The strange quiet had settled over the house wrapped around me like a soft blanket. I liked it. I let out a slow breath, letting the warmth sink into my chest, and closed my eyes it was easier to face the darkness behind my eyelids than the life around me.
Out of all the feelings in the world, emptiness is the one that cuts the deepest. I exist, but I don’t live.
When I look back, my memories come only as fragments, blurry flashes, storylines that slip through my hands. I can’t place them. I don’t know what happened, when it happened, or why.
I opened my eyes again and quickly forced out the unwelcome memories of the past.

I have no idea how long I spent locked up at home.
But a few days later, my friend’s apparently flawless intuition kicked in, and realizing I was probably starving to death, she showed up with bags full of groceries.
“I seriously thought you were dead,” she said, as she stepped inside and looked around my messy living room. “What happened here?”
She gave the dark, gloomy house a look of utter disgust, set the groceries down on the table, and opened the curtains.
I can’t say I was thrilled about the daylight, but with Eva, arguing is pointless.
Once the curtains were open, she turned to me with her hands on her hips.
“What’s going on, Nene?”
She dropped into an armchair, and let out a sharp scream when she landed on an empty bottle in a very unfortunate way.
“You should look before you sit.”
“If you cleaned your damn apartment, I wouldn’t have to worry about ending up in the ER with glass shards up my ass.”
“Let me breathe, will you?” I lit a cigarette and tucked my bare feet up on the chair.
“Did you kick him out?”
“You knew I’d do it eventually, didn’t you?” I answered her question with a question, taking a long drag.
“I never understood how you lived with a pig like Henry in the first place.”
“Please don’t.”
“How many years did you waste on that idiot, Nene?”
“A lot. And I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Are you okay?”
“What makes me happiest is that I’ll never have to see his idiot friend again.”
“He was still trying to get in bed with you?” she asked, rolling her eyes in disgust as she headed to the kitchen to make some coffee.
“Yeah. Just a few days ago, he walked into my office, locked the door behind him, sat on my desk, and looked at me with those disgusting eyes. I swear I felt like the lowest piece of shit on Earth.”
“Well, that’s your fault.”
“Oh, it’s my fault that he bailed my asshole husband out of prison and that he’s been blackmailing me for the past three years?”
“It’s your fault for not dumping Henry’s ass three years ago.”
“I felt sorry for him. I thought I could help him.”
“What are you going to do now?”
“Take the break I deserve.” I shrugged and crushed my cigarette in the ashtray. “I’m going to the countryside.”
“You’re joking, right?” Eva practically spat her coffee back out, her big brown eyes going even wider.
“What’s so bad about the countryside? Picture it! Me with cows, goats, chickens…”
I was really getting into it, so I wasn’t surprised when a pillow hit me straight in the face. Smiling, I placed it on the empty side of the armchair and whispered calmly:
“I’m so sick of this filthy city. I miss peace. I want to wake up and breathe in the scent of nature, not choke on car exhaust. What’s so wrong about wanting to rest and do nothing for a while? Don’t I deserve that? I’m burned out! Henry distorted years of my life. His messed up personality and dark past ruined my future. Everywhere I go, people look at me with disgust just because I’m Henry’s wife. He didn’t just destroy his own name, he destroyed mine along with it. He closed off every path I had. To everyone, I’m just some useless man’s wife, working at his best friend’s company just to clean up after his dirty business. Tell me, Eva, what will the city lose if I disappear for a while?”
“Don’t talk like some cheap whore”Eva rolled her eyes, sipping her now-cold coffee with no enthusiasm. “I just can’t picture you with cows.”
“Neither can I,” I smiled faintly, resting my tired face on her shoulder.
When I felt her lips press against my forehead, I wasn’t surprised that after all these years, tears I’d kept buried so carefully finally slipped out.
“It’s time I return to myself. Time to become Nene again not just Henry’s wife.”
“Ex-wife,” she corrected with a smile. I smiled back and exhaled deeply.
“When are you leaving?”
“Very soon.”

***
Eva had left quite a while ago. I’d cleaned up the place a bit, and just as I emerged from a hot bath, fully relaxed, the doorbell rang. I wrapped my robe tightly around me, my still-wet hair clinging to my neck as I walked toward the heavy metal door, drying it with a towel.
“I know you’re home, Nene.”
Of course. I hadn’t shown up at work in days, and that idiot boss of mine apparently decided it was within his rights to come to my doorstep.
“Is it that hard to understand I don’t work for you anymore?”
“You still owe a debt,” George replied calmly, slamming the door behind him as he stepped inside.
“Henry will pay you. You’re not getting another coin from me, George. I’m done. The days when I’d tolerate your pathetic behavior because of him are over. I hate myself for the humiliation I endured. So go to hell. Both of you. With your filthy business and your twisted little fantasies. And him, God knows which bar he’s rotting in right now.”
“Are you done?”
He was so calm, it scared me for a second. I tossed the towel I’d been gripping onto the armchair beside me.
“I want you to leave.”
“Pay your debt, and I will.”
“I don’t owe you anything.”
That’s all I could say before George lunged forward and shoved me so hard, I collapsed into the armchair behind me.
“Stop!”
“You could’ve lived a better life, Nene,” he said, gripping my thigh so tightly it brought tears to my eyes.
I’ve often regretted being born a woman but right now, I regretted it more than ever. Always aggression. Always pressure. Always someone trying to take something. I was so sick of it.
“Take your hands off me.”
I don’t know where I found that voice in me, but it was enough to freeze George in place. He stepped back for a second, eyeing me hungrily in my robe.
“You still owe a debt, Nene,” he muttered, turning his back and slamming the door shut behind him.

My life had begun to unravel long ago, when my parents died in a tragic car crash. If you ask the investigators, they’d say it was due to icy roads, that my father lost control of the wheel. But deep down, I’ve always believed that crash was just as staged as the fact that I eventually became the daughter-in-law of my father’s old friend. 
Henry and I had known each other since childhood. He saw me grow up. I don’t know when I became desirable woman to him, but he chased off every men who come close. Eventually, he claimed me as his own. No one forced me to stay with him. I genuinely fell for him. God, where was my mind when I let myself feel something for that man? A useless, lazy wreck of a person. 

It was after midnight when the pounding on the door made it clear who it was. I dragged my body out of bed, and before opening the door, I called my neighbor for backup, just in case I needed help getting rid of him. David is much older than me, kind, humble. For some reason, living next to him had always given me a sense of peace.
Henry had never been violent, I’ll give him that but still, I asked David  to be alert.
When I opened the door, I wasn’t surprised. His eyes were red and glassy, his shirt half-untucked, reeking of alcohol. I wasn’t shocked by the way his heavy hands found my body, or the slurred words about not being able to live without me. That part might’ve been true, a man so incapable of anything surely had no future without me. But since I had already made the decision to erase even the memory of him from my life, I pushed him off in disgust.
“Look at you.”
“I just had a bit to drink.”
“How much is ‘a bit’? Ten bottles?”
I tightened my robe, staring directly into his disoriented eyes.
“When did the man I once loved become this?”
I whispered the question bitterly and headed to the kitchen to make him a strong coffee. I didn’t love him anymore, but I never forgot that after nights of heavy drinking, the coffee I made had always helped him.
“Baby…” The word, muttered in that broken, half-sober tone and the fingers followed, slipping over my body.
“Forgive me, Nene.”
Hearing that fake confession made me lean over the table, eyes shut tight in pain.
“Nene.”
His fingers snuck past my robe, and the tears came quickly. I shook him off and moved toward the entrance, flung the door open, and, without even looking at him, whispered through clenched teeth:
“Get out.”
“Nene, please.”
“Because of you, because of your rotten personality my life is ruined. Your jealousy pushed every friend away. Your pathetic principles got me fired from my job. Your fears filtered through everyone I knew until only your idiot friends were left around me. I tolerated it. I tolerated everything because I loved you. God, I can’t even believe I once loved you. When did I make that mistake? When did I give you permission to destroy me like this? All I ever asked for was loyalty!”
I screamed, my voice cracking, tears pouring.
“You stole my life, Henry and now I want you gone. Walk out that door and never… never show me your disgusting face again.”
“Nene”
I felt him flinch, my breakdown sobering him slightly. He took a step forward.
“Stay right there.”
I raised a hand and glared at him.
“Baby, please”
“I want you gone from my life. Forever. I never want to see you again.”
“You’ll regret this, Nene.”
“No. You will regret treating me this way. Your sick mind only knows how to fuck more women. I despise you Henry.”
“Are you okay?”
David’s voice came from behind the door.
“He’s leaving now.”
I met Henry’s silent stare, and only after he finally stepped out did I let myself breathe.
“Goddamn it.”
As I closed the door, unconsciously collapsed against my neighbor’s chest and broke down crying like a little child.

For context — the last time I saw him, he was deeply in debt, owing tens of thousands of euros. His social security benefits were about to end (in France, unemployment aid only lasts for two years). If he didn’t sell his apartment or his house, he’d have no income at all. On top of that, he was dealing with a lawsuit against the company that fired him. His situation was complicated, but to protect his privacy, I won’t go into the details.  
  
He was struggling — financially and health-wise. But instead of looking for a new job or trying to resolve the lawsuit, what did he do? He got on Grindr and started dating a 19-year-old high school student. I tried my best not to judge, but it’s hard when you’re watching someone self-destruct right in front of you.  
  
Joe even did him a favor by getting him an appointment with a new lawyer. But Nico didn’t show up. When Joe asked why, he said he “didn’t have time.”  
Well… apparently, he did have plenty of time to cruise on Grindr. That’s why I was so mad.  
  
Looking back, maybe I could have chosen my words differently. I thought he needed a kick in the butt, but… maybe that wasn’t what he needed at all. Either way, I respected his decision and haven’t contacted him since. The last I heard about Nico was through Joe.  
  
Joe stopped by to see him one day after work. They went to McDonald’s and had a coffee. Joe said they didn’t talk much, and that Nico didn’t look well. He didn’t mention me at all during their conversation.  
  
There was one small positive thing, though — at the end, Nico told Joe to say hello to me.

1ovlkg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooks/comments/1ovlkg8/i_set_i_timer_of_30_minutes_closed_my_eyes_and/,"I set I timer of 30 minutes, closed my eyes, and wrote whatever comes to my mind on my laptop.","hi, I’m writing this really at random. I’m actually closing my eyes right now, I have no idea what’s on the screen, no idea if I’m even still writing or not. I’ll quickly check to confirm this: yes, I’m still writing.

So, I’ve set a timer for 30 minutes. I won’t stop until I hear it. I’m just writing anything that comes up in my head. Today is, I guess, the 13th of November, year twenty twenty-five. Time flies by so quickly. Just yesterday, or so it feels, it was twenty twenty. I had no idea what I wanted. I had the idea of being an engineer, but just the idea. It felt out of reach back then. And yet, here I am now, an engineer, graduated with honors, with a job. I’m smart, alhamdulillah.

But I still have the same issues I had back then. I still watch sexual content and masturbate Yes, it’s an addiction, one that plays on a primal instinct of ours as humans. It’s hard to get rid of, but not impossible. Still, I don’t do my best to tackle it. Today was the last time I gave in to it, and it had the usual deteriorating outcome it always has. I feel shitty. I didn’t pray all day, didn’t work, didn’t learn, didn’t do sport. I did nothing, just ate, went to the toilet, had a meal, slept. Like a freaking animal.

And now, where the heck am I going with this? What should I do? I don’t know. I really don’t know. I set out to start something, but I lack motivation to do it. How can I even have motivation when I constantly deplete it using my phone, chasing instant gratification? It kills any motivation I could have. My brain is like: well, I can get that dopamine quickly and cheaply from a movie or an anime or something sexual, so why bother getting up for real gratification that doesn’t feel shitty afterward?

It’s a biological thing, a curse and a challenge of being alive. But you know what? Neuroplasticity, tawakkul ala Allah, I can change. That’s the beautiful gift we have as humans: we can change. Either for the better or for the worse, and the worse is usually easier.

I just wonder, how am I even thinking what I’m thinking now, to write what I’m writing? It’s fascinating how these words are generated, how these ideas emerge in my brain, then get converted into muscle movements that map to my memory of the keyboard, which then translates through some smart electronics into pixels on the screen. It’s really fascinating.

So, to trace it all the way in, somehow an idea or words are generated in my brain. There’s a chemical reaction that maps that idea into the movement of my fingers. And all this happens in real time, milliseconds or less. Subhan Allah.

Now, with my eyes still closed, I hear the sound of rain. I hear the sound of me typing. I feel, by the way, that I scrambled a lot in the last sentence, but it’s just a feeling, right? I’ll continue anyway. The timer hasn’t ticked yet. I don’t know how much time has passed, but I already feel bored doing this. Still, it’s fine. One should accept boredom. That’s what we’re always trying to escape, using the phone, using food, using anything that distracts us from ourselves. But at this moment, I’m facing myself.

It’s interesting, I’m typing what I think, which in itself is a kind of gamification of the process. The fact that I can actually do it gives me some dopamine, because not everyone can do this. Anyway, it’s still hard, not something I’ve ever done before, or that people usually do.

My eyes hurt from being closed. I just opened them, the screen is already full of words. It’s actually been quite a while since I’ve typed this much. These days, LLMs write everything. I just explain what to do, and voila, it does it. Then I review and polish. But maybe that’s deteriorating us. It’s something new in history. Maybe it makes learning more efficient, but it can also make us lazy. And laziness makes us stupid over time, very stupid.

Anyway, this text is so random. I’m really sorry to whoever is reading this mess, including my future self, who’s probably the only one who ever will. I don’t know. I really don’t know.

Now, about my current moment. It’s a few minutes past midnight. I had work to do today, but didn’t do it. So I’ve got to do it before sleeping, because tomorrow I have other stuff to do for work. I need to write documentation for the experiments I’m doing on my project, which I haven’t yet completed. I didn’t pray. I need to get up, do wudu, pray at least my Isha prayer, and read some Quran. I need to make a to-do list for tomorrow and follow it. Maybe that’s the way to actually get rid of this mess I’m in.

Right now, I’ll write the list:  
TODO: experimentations and documentation on my project, pray Salat al-Fajr, pray all the salawat in time and also al-Witr and Ishraq, document and test the freelance project to prepare for the meeting afterwards, 100 push-ups.  
Not TODO: watch on the phone, no anime, movies, or anything on the phone, no LinkedIn, minimal WhatsApp, learn something, have morning coffee, make my own lunch and meals instead of spending on food outside.

I guess the 30 minutes of writing is almost done. I won’t check the timer, I’ll just keep waiting. Well, time now is the number of strokes I write. Words written by a human are really equivalent to his time. It’s literally a part of the human that wrote that piece of text, a part the person shares with the world. It’s a beautiful way of extending one’s life. If you think about it, we are time. Each second that passes takes from us. We are the sum of the time we live, and thus the analogy I presented earlier.

Okay, I now hear the clock ticking. The experiment is finished. This was me, past midnight, on a random day of November 2025.",0,1762991089.0,notebooks,2,0.13,False
1ovljpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ovljpi/aitah_for_defending_my_friend_for_telling_me_a/,AITAH for defending my friend for telling me a rumor about my husband?,"My (31) husband (31) are having an argument & I need to know if I’m “fundamentally wrong”. 

Long story but bear with me. We live on a dead end street & are friends or at least friendly acquaintances with most our neighbors. Months ago we noticed that one of the families on our street started going to our church & my husband invited the other husband (let’s call him L) to his men’s Bible study that takes place down the road from 6:30pm-7:30pm. L went with hubs twice, then said he got a new job & couldn’t go anymore & that was that. 

Now one of my closest friends (let’s cal her B) also lives on our street. Months later B comes over very upset & said she had something difficult to talk to me about. She said ANOTHER neighbor pulled her aside while walking to my house to say he heard through the grapevine that my husband & L were just using Bible study as cover & we’re actually meeting up with escorts from backpage or going to strip clubs. 

Now, this is not true. 
1. We live in a small town where the closest strip club is 40 minutes away. 
2. We share a bank account & he has no other extra income or sources of income to pay for escorts. 
3. We share locations & my 3 year old won’t sleep without him. So the moment his bible study is over I’m watching his location desperate for him to come home to put our kid asleep. He always goes straight to the local coffee shop & immediately comes back. 


It didn’t even cross my mind the rumor was true, but I knew it would really hurt my husbands feelings. B is going through a nasty divorce herself & asked for us not to confront her source because he helps her with handyman related tasks since the divorce commenced & she didn’t want to risk losing that help. BUT she wanted me to know & do what I wish the information. 

As predicted my husband was really upset & also worried that this rumor would spread through our church or make its way to his work. So despite B asking him not to, he confront the neighbor that told B about the rumor (in a very chill way). The conversation went no where & was no help. 

I told B the next day & she was really upset & worried she lost one of her support system. 

I told my husband that although I understand why he did what he did, that he still owes B an apology. 

He says that he doesn’t because she participated in spreading the rumor because she came to me. & told me about it. Therefore making her complicit in helping spread the rumor. I told him that is irrational & a very unfair way to look at it. 

He said I am not dealing in undeniable facts & that I am only being emotional to protect my friend. Is that true? I feel crazy cause it seems so obvious that she did the right thing. 

EDIT: For calcification, I think my husband did the right thing. I fully supported his decision before he did it. Something needed to be done & he did the most logical thing. BUT it did put my friend in a bad spot. When all she was trying to do was warn me. I just thought that despite it needing to be done, he should still apologize cause he might have screwed her for also just doing the right thing. ",2,1762991038.0,AITAH,27,0.63,False

In it there's coverage of a WVMT Morning Drive interview where Ward 7 Rep Evan Litwin broke down how one house managed to distribute 945,000 syringes in a year. He's pushing for quarterly surprise audits and connected it to the city's broader safety issues and the fact we've only hired two officers this year.

There's also a full breakdown of Burger Week participants since it ends Friday. I organized every single Burlington area burger by price so you can plan your last few days. Ranges from $12 at Four Quarters up to that $36 lobster situation at Bleu, plus vegetarian options like the falafel burger at Daily Planet.

I compiled results from that sandwich thread that blew up a few months ago asking for the best sandwiches in Burlington. Got 108 comments and Poppy's absolutely crushed it with 109 total upvotes, Union Jacks came in second with 61, Top of the Block had 53. The full tallied list is in there with all ten top spots.

The newsletter also rounds up the biggest discussions from r/burlington this week including the Vermont State Troopers starting those voluntary downtown patrols, all the hype around La Di Da Pizza in the Old North End, people sharing their nightmare commutes from our first winter snow storm, and the coffee shop recommendations for getting work done.

Plus there's volunteer opportunities with Vermont Adult Learning if you want to help adults with literacy or computer skills, daily food and drink deals for eating out on a budget, a few local podcast episodes worth checking out, and some suggestions for things to do around Burlington in late fall before winter really locks in.

1ovlgvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedENM/comments/1ovlgvo/advice_sought_for_complicated_situation/,Advice sought for complicated situation," Please excuse the book.  Scroll down and see how long it is before you decide you’re in for this post.  I don’t need hate. I need perspective from others in similar community.  My situation is complicated and this I need some perspective from others.  And my mono friends have limited knowledge of my lifestyle nor would they do anything but laugh at how crazy it all sounds to them.   Will post this in ENM also since the communities are similar.  

These are the the players: Me, (F53), live in BF (M65), call him Max— together 8 yrs, live together 2. We live in Ca and  are in Vegas a lot— we talk about a possible  move in a couple of years.  That’s the plan we discuss at least.    Idk if it’ll happen.  I’m ok if not.  But were there often.  So  I have  a bf here and a bf in Vegas.  Both of these relationships are a result of my bf wanting us to open up almost two years ago.    The point of this post is actually about an ex bf (M55) and something changing between us recently.  Call him Jack .  

For our ages, people always guess Max to be at least 10 yrs younger based on looked, although less so now cause he’s become disabled more and moves like it, and me, they guess mid- 30s to 40.   His age I guess is important since he’s recently become disabled and now lives more like the man of his age.  That’s not how we were.  

Ok:  HISTORY— I was with my ex bf Jack for 6 yrs.  We were both a bit out of divorces but we’d dated before meeting each other.  His ex wife however was actively leveraging what she could to keep getting time and money out of him and she enjoyed disturbing and interfering with  relationships with his kids as well as his relationship with  me or whoever he dates..  She caused a ton of stress on him and it began to transfer to us so I had broken it off with him.  After a long time of us trying to make it work.  Said go handle what you need to.  It was amicable but  he was so angry that she cost him our relationship.  Well, his youngest are now 19 and she has no leverage and he’s had time to center himself.  

Prior to and after him, and before Max, I’d been involved in shorter relationships that were poly.  So they knew about those.   One quad before him, one trio maybe a year after him. And before Max   We’ve stayed friends but like say hey two or three times a year. We talked about marriage when we were together  but he was dealing with the ex so long and so deeply emotional wrecked with her, I could see that wasn’t good for either of us to try to make that morph into a marriage.  He knows I’ve been with Max and has never said anything bad about him or
My dating or anything. It was always platonic and like a friend.  

My current bf, Max, was disabled by a severe case of Covid.  He nearly died.  He has long covid.  He had to retire three years ago.   Prior to getting sick, he was my match.  We both communicated well. He was dating ENM before me.  He knew about my poly experience and thoughts.  We started dating and instantly started dating monogamously.  But he lived and hour and some away and had a dad who went stage four heart failure so it was only two years ago that he moved in with me.  
****************************************
This post and my thoughts are largely based on where we are with his disability and our lifestyle changes as a result.  And what o want to do moving forward.  
****************************************
So we were monogamous until almost two years ago— 2 yrs in Jan.  This was him coming to me to
Say he wanted to open up the relationship for me because he knew he was t going to get much better and actually, he’s more seemingly failing in health each year.   With long COVID, he has a back issue, nerve damage that keeps him to walking about 15 ft and then he needs to rest.   He has immune issues and is sick about every month.  He has heart and kidney issues.  But he tries to keep a bright outlook.  We’re a loving couple.  We go to dinner two or three times a week and see friends.  Our sex life took a hit as he had limits, endurance issues and sometimes, even the blue pill doesn’t help him.   And then there’s the pain he will feel to have  intercourse.  But we have a sex life, it’s just changed and can be quite depressed sometimes.  We are both high drive people but he just can’t anymore.  And he’s severely fatigued.  Sleeps a lot of his days  daily.  Thus, he came and told me that he loved me and wanted to stay with me but feels it’s unfair to not give and expect me to sit with him all the time. Now, I did sit a lot with him those first months of recovery and rehab.  But yea, we came to a place to see this was his new normal.  And it’s evolving.  And doctors really don’t know what to do so he’s frustrated and says, “I’m gonna go when I go. No promise of tomorrow.”  He’s said this a few times.  I know he may likely have a heart attack or idk.  Just not wake up.  Idk.  It’s been tough!  But we try to still do things. We try to still travel.  

Well the travel is where things surfaced.  Yes, we opened. I have a bf in ca. that I see enough that we enjoy each others company.  Sometimes it’s all three of us. We all go out to dinner or the casino.  But I’m not in Love with him   Nor him to me.  It works for us. I have a similar relationship in Vegas.  Both men want a gf but don’t want something high maintenance or wanting to make family with.  We care for each other but I think there’s not “in love” for anyone besides me and Max. 

Now my ex bf, Jack— I called him last March to have him talk to my daughter at dinner once.  I told my bf.  My daughter was 18 and wanted to marry another 18 old who was going away in the military and no one was for this.  So I arranged for them to chat so she could ask questions about military life, money, all the everything that this boy was promising her to get her to marry him.  So, there were some follow ups.  He’d called and asked how things were going with her.  Always briefly “how are you?”    Well, fast forward, I’d heard from him maybe every 6 wks or so.  I’d mention it to my bf.  It wasn’t a big deal.  There was a lot going on with my daughter. Jack  wasn’t entering my mind. 

Ok.  So Max and I go on like 4 vacations from Jan to July.  The one in July was to Nashville.   And this one really pointed out to us how limited he is now. It was our second big vacation in a year. The previous fall we’d taken a cruise and felt the impact.  Our vacays to Vegas are less notable but still impacted.  No matter, his  disabilty was making an impacted I was growing frustrated.  I. August  I told him, that I felt like I needed more.   That though I have these other bfs, I’ve always maintained us as the primary relationship and everything works around this.  And it was going ok but I don’t feel anything for them that’s super meaningful and that before him, when I was single, I wanted a relationship to include travel and adventures and I wanted it with someone I loved and that it was meaningful with and that we haven’t been doing it that way anymore and it’s so frustrating.  I feel like I’m on a lockdown in a way, because most of our time together is him sleeping.  I’m there.  But he’s sleeping.  Or I’m working outside at home cause he’s sleeping.  Or he gets run down as we have to
Go back to the room so he can rest.  And these guys aren’t going to fulfill this either but that I feel I need something and idk what.   

At that time, yes he was like what are you saying, but I assured him that I love him and I want to stay with him but I also feel like I’m not happy.   I feel like the way we travel and do things is suppressing me and I constantly make choices to not do something because he can’t and for so long I was ok with that. But I can begin to to feel some resentment.  And my kids have all asked me if things still working for me.  And he’s just always in pain.  Always sleeping. And this isn’t fair to me.  And he knows this!  He’s said this so many times. He apologizes and generally I’m like, “it’s fine!  Let’s figure it out. “. But it is pressing me the longer time goes.   We just did another cruise a month ago and wow, I can’t believe how little we did.   We even anticipated it being low key but it was far more so than I expected.  He didn’t even want to go out for coffee.  The pool was a big deal and would wipe him out.  He was exhausted if  we went off the ship with him in a scooter— he rented a scooter to make it better, and pretty much we just relaxed, did dinner, comedy or something.   So low key.  Not anything like how we were.  I’m a very active woman for my age.  Ride my bike ten miles one way to work three times a week.  Raise chickens.  Work outside on projects. Converted a van for van life activities which Max can’t go do.  So I go alone or with my daughter, or I haven’t been going.  

So complicate this with my dad having a stroke 6 weeks ago.  I have to go out of state a few times to handle stuff.   And Jack checks in with me and hears about my dad and so I guess he’s increased checking in a bit. Calling me every couple  weeks.   And we have long talks sometimes.  From dad and the kids issues.  But then I confessed to him about how things are going for Max.    In these talks, we’re not talking about us very much or anything.  We had had a discussion about how we ended up and what might have been. But otherwise things have been very much like convos  I’d have a friends.  I told him about Max and the impact of this long covid.  And emergency room visits and day to day and travel.  And he took it all in and kindly says how
Bad he feels bad for the guy.  How yeah, he’d love to be like, “oh, come be either me, but he said honestly I feel bad. That sucks.  Sounds like you guys were making a life together. “ he knows I seem sad and stuck.  He understands   Well? Somewhere in the last few weeks, he’s been in my mind.   We were always do good together and easy. Laugh. Playful.   Could talk too!  Good!  And I began to have the idea about being with both of them. Being with Max and beginning again with Jack.  And breaking it of with the other guys.  And yes, Jack knows about our open relationship and that info. I told him more awhile ago about all that.   Just matter of fact like.  

So here’s where I’m just having  a hard time seeing clearly what I do: 

My kids have brought up if I fit with Max anymore. Am I happy.  That they know I can’t be happy cause I have to keep not doing me.  And I tell them I love him and he loves me so hard and so good. I hate to toss him away.  I don’t see it.  My friends have implied similar.  Some say nothing. They are all mono friends except I have two friends who know that we have an open relationship.  We don’t talk about it much cause I don’t want them to be u comfortable. They know it’s a situation Theyve not judged. I’ve not asked them about this because I don’t want to affect their relationship with Max and I.  

And, on my own, many times I’ve wondered if I want to stay with him.   Before we opened I had thoughts.  Then he brought up opening.  I always decide I do want to stay but I find myself becoming resentful recently that his disability is locking me down.  So I’ve begun to think about what do I want?   But it’s a lot.  I’ve got a lot going on too!

  Another thing that impacts my decisions is when I’m going to retire.  I’m on track to retire in another four years.  Max retired remember, and spends most of the days sleeping while I work or do projects at the house.  We plan getaways often to just be together. Away from work. Away from my kids.  This may or may not include my bf, depending on where we are.  We may all go out together or I may have dates tucked in there too.  Real dates.  Dinners.  Concerts.  It’s not just sexual but there’s always sex regardless of what we do on our dates.  But I know when I retire
 I won’t be watching tv all day to just hang out with him.  

Jack, he lives a few time zones away and he still works with the military. When he’s working he’s often working a lot.   So right now, I see that I have to finish up my work to top off my retirement as a big deal.  Especially as an unmarried woman.  (Also note, Max would love for us to be married but so much has kept us from that and notably, if we did, he’ d lose out of some social security and qualifying for things medically that he does qualify for as a single man.  So that has been something to  consider.   As well, his boys are just barely friendly to me.  While my kids treat him so good.   It’s something.  And it seems Jack would still like to see about my marrying him.  

What do I do? I think about this all the time. 

I can break up with Max  And I feel like my heart will break.   I love Max so much and see us together until likely, it will be he who passes first.  I love hanging out and going to eat.  Hanging with our friends.  But can he go do everything we/ I like to do?   Not anymore. Or not without it being greatly impacted.  As well, our sex life is being further impacted because with more caretaking on my part, I’m finding myself bothered or not attracted to him the same — it isn’t finding me with him.  My thinking is less sexual with him not.  Not to say it’s all gone but it’s quite different.  And he knows and we mourn it.  He apologizes.  He literally hurts all the time.  Or he’s sleeping.  Anyone would tone down sexual expectations. But being we are both high drive, it impacts us both differently. I do y actually want to break it off with him.  
OR—

I can be single.  Which I don’t want to be actually.  But I could.  And just have bfs. I guess.   Yeah— this really isn’t what I’m wanting.  

OR-
And I consider bringing up bringing Jack into the relationship.  But unlike the other bfs, I’m sure we’d be in love again and be happy and want to be together.  This will impact me and Max. Pretty much, I’d have to stay living where I am right now till I retire to make sure I maximize that. But it’s like four years.  And fours yrs will pass quick.  I’d travel to see Jack often.  

In that four years I realize the likelihood that Max may pass somehow.  He’s not well a hasn’t been for three years.  And he may actually adjust well with my dating Jack.   I always have traveled a lot without him— with family or friends and work, that to move that travel to
Seeing Jack is realistic with not too much impact for
The time I’m already gone each year.   But with Jack, he’d know I have feelings still and that love would be there.  And commitment.  Different than what is going on with these other bfs.   He does remind me all the time to be ready for when he goes.  He’s told me what to do if we come to that time.  How he’s to be buried. What things and money go to who.  I’m not just being crazy and thinking about this.  So it brings me to thinking about Jack too.  

If I tell Max about how the conversations with Jack have changed, he’s going to be hurt.  I don’t want to hurt him.  But I did also tell him in the summer that I need more.  I didn’t know what and we tabled it when my dad had a stroke. So if I  say I want to bring Jack in, break up with the other guys, and have a relationship with two men who I could love both and both would love me, how do I not hurt anyone?   Yes, I’ve lightly mentioned this to Jack and he really didn’t say much.  He knows I can’t come out permanently to him anyways till I finish work in a few years.   He knows Max’s health and what that means.  So it’s unspoken in a way.  

What do I do?  How do I say anything?   How do I not hurt anyone or keep that to a minimum?  Does anyone have constructive and helpful input?   Thanks for your time.

I've started adding chocolate and peanut butter flavored protein powder to high protein greek yogourt.  Game changer! It's delicious.  I also add bran buds to add some fibre.

What I mean by this is every domme is different as is every sub. Some dommes don’t need/want small senders and some prefer it. Some subs have smaller budgets than others. It’s important to have a good understanding of what is realistic for you and the person you are interested in. 

For example, I get free coffee everyday. A latte, drip, a cappuccino, whatever I want. I get that for free, so my interest isn’t necessarily in having a sub who wants to send me 5-10 bucks for coffee everyday. Does that mean I don’t appreciate or have no need for small sends? No, it just means it isn’t going to be used for coffee or even breakfast. So if a subs specific interest is in buying my daily coffee… well we wouldn’t be a good fit and that’s okay! 

The point is you have to vet the person and find out if your needs and wants are realistic to what can be provided. There’s a domme out there for every sub you just have to do your research. ",2,1762990652.0,findomchatters,0,1.0,False

Anyone else wake up feeling like a rusty robot sometimes? 🤖 Seriously, getting out of bed in the morning can feel like a workout *before* my actual workout! If you're nodding along, you're definitely not alone. Turning the big 5-0 (and beyond!) definitely brings some… *interesting* new experiences, right?

So, I've been experimenting lately, and I stumbled upon a game-changer: a ridiculously simple 5-minute morning routine that's actually made a huge difference. And trust me, I’m all about maximizing results with minimal effort. 😉

Here’s the deal: I used to groan getting out of bed, feeling like I was moving in slow motion. Now? I feel… well, not *exactly* like a spring chicken, but definitely less creaky!

Here's the magic:

*   **Neck Rolls:** Easy peasy. Gently roll your neck clockwise and counter-clockwise. Listen to those little *pops* – it's like tiny stress bubbles bursting! (Okay, maybe not *exactly*, but it *feels* good, right?)
*   **Shoulder Shrugs:** Up, back, and down. Repeat. Feel the tension melting away. I imagine I'm shrugging off all the day's worries before they even start. Works surprisingly well!
*   **Arm Circles:** Small circles forward, then backwards. Then bigger circles. Feel the blood flowing! I like to pretend I'm conducting a tiny orchestra of awesome. 🎶
*   **Torso Twists:** Gently twist from side to side, keeping your feet planted. Don't force anything. Just a gentle sway. Feel the stretch in your back. Thinking about getting those core muscles moving.
*   **Ankle Rotations:** Sit on the edge of the bed and rotate your ankles in both directions. Such a simple thing, but wakes up the whole body!

I know, I know. It sounds ridiculously simple. But give it a try! Five minutes. That’s it. You can even do it *in* bed if you're feeling extra lazy.

Seriously, I was surprised at how much better I felt after just a few days. My mornings feel less… *ugh*, and more like, ""Okay, I can handle this!""

So, what do you guys think? Anyone else have a go-to morning routine to combat the creaks and groans? Or am I the only one who feels like a walking Tin Man before their morning coffee?

Rain tapped the windows as the final minutes of 2023 drifted past Clara unnoticed.

Each drop traced a slow, uncertain path down the glass. The television murmured in the background — low volume, just enough to soften the silence.

Clara sat cross-legged on the sofa, laptop balanced on a cushion, surrounded by notebooks that looked less like research and more like nesting birds. The screen’s glow washed her face in a pale, anxious light as she scrolled through yet another archived article.

The 1920s: a decade of modern miracles and quiet catastrophes.

The words blurred. She blinked hard, realising her eyes had been dry for some time now.

Her research paper — America in Flux: The Year of Transition — was due in two weeks. In truth, she’d been working on it for months. She wasn’t just fascinated by the era; she was haunted by it. It was a time suspended awkwardly between centuries — unsure which future to choose, or which past to mourn.

She reread a note she’d scribbled in the margin earlier:
Progress comes at the cost of certainty.
The cursor blinked beside the sentence, patient, unsympathetic.

On the coffee table sat her nightly companions: a mug of cold coffee, a water glass half-full, and a small orange prescription bottle with a white cap. She twisted it idly between her fingers.

The pills steadied her — supposedly. “They balance the rhythms,” her doctor had said, though the phrasing had always made her uneasy. Like her mind was an instrument slightly out of tune.

Lately nothing felt tuned at all.

Some nights she’d swear the ticking of her wall clock skipped beats, or that the hallway light dimmed too slowly after she flicked it off. Sometimes a shadow would shift just before she turned her head.

Exhaustion, she told herself. Burnout. Too much caffeine. Not enough daylight.

Still, she took the pills at exactly 11:30 PM every night. Routine, she believed, kept her anchored.

She glanced at the clock now.

11:42.

She told herself she’d stay up for the bells — a ritual she’d always kept. Fireworks, renewal, proof that time still moved in a straight, obedient line.

But her body disagreed. Her shoulders slackened; her eyelids drooped. She set the laptop aside and allowed the recliner to claim her.

Outside, the slick wet street reflected passing headlights like ripples of mercury. Somewhere nearby, a premature firework cracked the night.

The TV played on — a rerun of a forgotten sci-fi series. A man in a metallic suit droned about temporal resonance.
Clara smiled weakly. “Temporal resonance,” she murmured. “That’d be nice.”

She closed her eyes.

When she opened them again, she wasn’t sure whether a minute or an hour had passed. The television had dissolved into static.

The ticking clock had grown louder — irregular, like a heartbeat faltering.

Her eyelids dipped; her thoughts drifted. To the Roaring Twenties she’d spent months inhabiting — jazz clubs and suffragettes, grainy film reels, the strange glow of modernity not yet sure of itself.

In that twilight between waking and sleep, she heard a voice — soft, female, brushing her ear:

“You’re almost there.”

Her eyes flew open.

Nothing. Only static hissing like rainfall trapped inside the walls.

“Dreaming,” she whispered. “Already dreaming.”

Ten minutes to midnight.

The house settled. Pipes clicked. A ceiling corner let a small creak. The wind found a seam in the old window frame and whistled through. Clara pulled her blanket tighter.
Inside her mind, the countdown began — not from the TV, but from somewhere deep and private:

Ten… nine… eight…
A pulse throbbed behind her eyes.

Seven… six…
The static shifted into a low chime.

Five… four… three… two…
The air trembled.

One.

BONG.

Her eyes snapped open.

BONG.

The sound was impossibly close — metallic, cavernous. She shot upright; the blanket fell away.

BONG.

Something was different. The room was too cold. Too dark.
She reached for the lamp — her fingers touched not plastic, but instead fabric. An embroidered lampshade. A brass pull-chain.

Her pulse stuttered. The television was gone. The laptop was gone. The digital clock, the charger, the remote — gone.
In their place stood heavy furnishings: dark wood, brass fittings, velvet drapes. Her recliner had become a narrow chaise lounge upholstered in deep plum.

“You’re dreaming,” she breathed. “This is a dream.”

But the air didn’t smell like dreams. It smelled of wax, coal smoke, and the faint sourness of old wallpaper.

She rose, legs trembling. Outside the window, gaslight shimmered through rolling fog. Horses clopped somewhere unseen.

“This… isn’t possible.”

She approached the mirror above the fireplace. Her reflection stared back, but the lighting made her appear almost sepia-toned — like an old photograph not fully developed.

Her breath fogged the glass. “Maybe it’s the pills,” she whispered. “Maybe I fell asleep too fast.”

The thought steadied her — until she caught movement in the reflection. A woman stood behind her.

Pale. Motionless. Blurred, like someone caught halfway between worlds. Clara whirled around. Nothing. Only the chaise, the dim room, and the alien hush of another time.

BONG.

Another chime rolled through the air — deliberate, slow, ancient.

Her hands shook as she pressed her palms to her temples. The edges of the room shimmered like heat rising from a hot road.

“This isn’t a dream,” she whispered. “But it can’t be real.”

And then, from the window — soft, like static:

I’m the kind of girl who remembers little details, who asks how your day really went, who listens even when you don’t have the words yet. But lately, it feels like everyone just wants something temporary, a quick chat, a moment of distraction, and then they disappear. And I’m honestly tired of that. I want the kind of friendship where you can be completely yourself. Where you can send random late-night messages, talk about the past, your fears, your dreams, all the little things most people don’t ask about. I’m into slow mornings with coffee, deep talks that last until 2am, old songs that make you feel everything, and just having someone who gets it without needing to explain too much.

Sometimes I overthink, sometimes I get quiet, but when I care, I care deeply. I don’t want perfect people. I just want honest ones, someone who doesn’t vanish when life gets busy, someone who chooses to stay when things aren’t exciting. If you’re around my age, 18–21, and you’re also craving something genuine, not forced, not shallow, message me. Maybe we’ll just end up talking about our favorite songs, or maybe we’ll become the kind of friends who don’t let go easily.

People often say Monero will grow more valuable as everyday usage increases. But that’s hard to imagine without a clear path to auto-debit (recurring payments) & better assimilation with day to day transactions. Most modern businesses rely on subscriptions, and Monero doesn’t yet offer a native way for merchants to charge customers on a set schedule without the customer initiating each payment.

Yes, some Ledger hardware wallets include NFC for quick, one-tap interactions—but Monero still lacks the end-to-end support that makes tap-to-pay feel seamless. That matters in places where speed is everything, like high-throughput retail and hospitality (coffee shops, bars), events and stadiums, taxis/rideshare, delivery, and tipping.

For larger businesses, the biggest missing capability is straightforward: auto-debit that lets companies bill reliably and predictably (Think phone/internet bills, Utilities, Rent etc). At the end of the day, most people and companies don’t care which rails the money uses…..as long as payments are low-friction and dependable. Until Monero can match those expectations, broad adoption will be tougher than it needs to be.

If anyone can get in contact with the Devs about this issue I think it would greatly increase the coins value as a secure/private payment processing system that everyone uses & naturally adopts. ",2,1762990334.0,xmrtrader,1,1.0,False

Are you dreading them as much as I used to?

Let's be real, the word ""routine"" can conjure up images of dawn runs and green smoothies, right? But what if I told you I *stopped* working full-time at 55, and part of my secret is actually a pretty… lazy morning routine? 🤫 Hear me out!

I used to think I had to be a super-achiever *all* the time. Wake up at 5 AM, hit the gym, conquer the world! Sound familiar? Turns out, for me, that was a recipe for burnout. Now? Now I’m embracing a slower pace and actually seeing *more* results. It's all about starting the day right, without feeling like you've already run a marathon before breakfast.

So, what does my “lazy” morning look like? Well...

*   **No alarm (most days!).** Seriously, the freedom is intoxicating. I wake up when my body is ready. (Okay, sometimes my cat decides when it's time, but still!)
*   **15 minutes of gentle stretching and breathing.** Think yoga, but without the pretzel poses. Just simple movements to get the blood flowing. You can find great free videos online!
*   **A leisurely cup of coffee or tea.** This is crucial. No rushing! This is my time to savor the quiet and just *be*.
*   **Reading something uplifting or inspiring.** Instead of scrolling through endless news (which, let’s face it, is usually depressing), I spend 15-20 minutes reading a book or article that makes me feel good. Currently re-reading ""Man's Search for Meaning."" Powerful stuff.
*   **Planning ONE (yes, just ONE) meaningful task for the day.** This is key! I don’t try to cram everything in. Just one thing that will make me feel productive and accomplished.

The best part? It’s completely customizable! Some days, I might swap the reading for a short walk in nature. Other days, I might just sit and meditate for a few minutes. The point is, it's *my* time, designed to nourish my mind and body, not stress me out.

Honestly, since adopting this ""lazy"" approach, I feel calmer, more focused, and generally happier. It's amazing how slowing down can actually speed things up in the long run.

I know what you might be thinking: ""This sounds nice, but is it *really* effective?"" My answer? Try it! See what works for *you*. Everyone's different. Maybe you thrive on early morning workouts. Awesome! But if you’re feeling burned out by the ""hustle culture,"" give this a shot. You might be surprised.

Speaking of powerful stuff, did you know that surrounding yourself with positive communities can significantly boost your motivation? We believe in strongest people., and that's why I wanted to share this resource with you: https://mavely.app.link/e/oORXrEU9iUb. Check it out!

So, what does *your* ideal morning look like? What small changes could you make to create a more peaceful and enjoyable start to your day? What are your ""lazy"" morning secrets? I’m all ears (or, well, eyes, since we’re on Reddit 😉).

1ovl88r,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1ovl88r/is_dreame_really_the_best/,Is Dreame really the best?,"Doing my best to keep this short, but I had a Roborock S5 Max for a few years that I loved aside from having to empty the bin and the subpar mopping. After it was lost in a house fire, I got a Dreame L20 Ultra as a replacement. I love the improved mopping capabilities and auto emptying/cleaning, but that's about it. In every other way, the S5 Max just worked better. Most of my complaints are related to software (mainly navigation and cleaning efficiency) and I had some back and forth with support before the warranty expired, so I already have a list of odd behaviors I was seeing around that time:

1. Navigation is extremely inefficient even with AI obstacle avoidance turned off. Where the S5 would squeeze into tight spots (like between table and chair legs), the L20 won't even try. It's constantly spinning in circles and going back and forth trying to  fill in spots it missed whereas the S5 was much more efficient. 
2. It gets ""stuck"" with nothing around it. If I pause it and restart it seconds later without moving it, it gets lost and needs to figure out where it is again, which can sometimes take a couple minutes and involve trips through several rooms.
3. The shape of my coffee table results in two squares of carpet surrounded by 1/2"" metal bars. The L20 struggles to get over those bars and then goes back and forth across them many times while only cleaning under the coffee table and and doesn't pick up much of anything. A few square feet of carpet takes 5 minutes to clean. The side brush also tends to fall off here because it doesn't have a screw like the S5 did.
4. If the cleaning activity has mopping but the mop pads aren't installed, it still goes back to the base to ""clean the pads"", but simply turns around and starts vacuuming again. 
5. It just ran a routine this morning that involved mopping and vacuuming. It cleaned the mop pads, left the dock without the mop pads, returned,  vacuumed 2 out of 4 carpets, then marked the operation ""complete"" without touching anything else.
6. It frequently can't find the dock when I press the home button, even if it's only a few feet away.
7. I've noticed the floors aren't anywhere near as clean as when I had my S5 Max. I can't tell if it's because scheduled events don't truly complete or if it's not performing as well, but I find large debris like leaves all over and use my cordless vacuum daily. There are almost always large tufts of dog hair sitting on the carpet. The S5 cleaned much better unless the dustbin was full.

Some things have improved a bit but I've just learned to deal with the rest. Based on my experience the new features have been a nice upgrade over the S5 Max but I have a lot more confidence in Roborock's software and overall execution. Unfortunately while I was out of town for a few weeks and my girlfriend was the only one here, the L20 ate a sock and was continually placed back on the base every time it shut off, which ultimately jammed the brush roll and ruined the motor. It makes awful noises and no longer has any suction.

I've been looking at current options and am surprised to see that Dreame seems like the current recommendation in mid to high end robot vacuums. Vacuum wars doesn't run tests that would expose the issues I've seen with my L20, which makes me kinda uncomfortable just following their recommendations this time around. I also can't imagine that people are spending $1000+ and having the same experience I was unless it's their first vacuum with navigation. Am I crazy or are other Dreame owners seeing similar issues with their vacuums? ",2,1762990241.0,RobotVacuums,0,1.0,False
1ovl6gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ovl6gx/i_know_it_will_get_better_since_ive_already_been/,"I know it will get better, since I've already been there, but while in the middle of the pain, it feels like there is no end in sight.","For context, I was in a LTR that ended after 19 years, including a very long breakup in the middle, and the last 5 being long distance. My now ex-wife went to get her PhD abroad. Due to the pandemic, I wasn't able to meet her for over a year, and when we finally met, I knew things were never going to be as they were. Although it was not a breakup at the time, it felt like one. For almost two years, I felt terrible, and one time, while I was visiting her, I almost asked for a divorce, but I wasn't brave enough to say the words. But she knew what I felt. When I returned home, through therapy, I decided that I had to focus on being well by myself, either to keep a long-distance marriage or to be single again. I remained married for another one year and a half, until I visited her and it was her turn to ask for a divorce. I was surprised that I was really calm and felt almost nothing. I guess the healing of the breakup was already done, even though we were officially still married.

After the divorce, my therapist said I was already ready to search for a new relationship. And I guess I was lucky enough to find someone one month after the divorce. It felt great loving and being loved again. It felt right at the beginning, but we started arguing quite a bit. I do believe that differences in a relationship always appear, and how we deal with them is important to have a healthy relationship. I believed it was possible that we could solve our issues. However, my ex-girlfriend had a 3-month work trip in another country on the horizon. I told her I would be fine since I got used to being by myself at the end of the marriage. Of course, I was wrong, and as our communication dwindled and she stopped answering my messages, I started to get frustrated. Since she didn't want to be responsible for that, she asked for a pause. I didn't want to put my life on hold, so I said we should break up.

The first few weeks were really painful. Eventually, I decided to try OLD. After a month of non-contact, my ex sent me a message saying that she still thought fondly about us. I missed her, so I started talking to her. We ended up arguing again because I wanted to know if she wanted to meet again when she returned, but she said she couldn't commit to it. In the meantime, I met someone from Tinder for a coffee, and it went as well as expected. I just couldn't stop comparing how it was not as good as the first meeting with my ex.

So, I decided to stop dating again and to wait for my ex to return, and maybe to try going back to her. I offered to pick her up at the airport, but she said she already had arranged a female friend to pick her up. So I offered to meet for a coffee when she was back, to which she agreed. The day she arrived, I sent a message asking how her trip was. She answered after I had already gone to sleep saying it was fine and she would later contact me to return a piece of luggage that I lent her, with no mention of the coffee. I said that there was no rush for the luggage, and that we could meet before because I'd like to see her. She just kept the silence for two days, until I explicitly asked if she wanted to go for the coffee. Instead of answering my question, she said she was busy with work and was getting sick. Then, she said she would have my luggage delivered. I got devastated that she just ignored my question, and we argued for one last time. She said that what mattered were actions and not words. I sure don't know what she meant because she didn't do anything for us to meet again, even though it was her that contacted me first after the breakup and agreed to meet for a coffee before she took the flight back.

After therapy, I decided to reinstall Bumble, and I never felt a slap so hard from destiny: her profile was the first one I saw. I blocked her and tried to move on. After a few matches that went nowhere, I decided to install Tinder also, and there she was again. One more time I blocked, and I'm not sure if Tinder bugged or she recreated her profile so soon, but I saw her for a second time on Tinder. This broke me. I haven't had a nice night of sleep since she arrived, even though we ended up never meeting again.

I don't regret the time I spent with her, and even though it ended with a broken heart, I will cherish the moments of love I had with her. But it is as I saw this in another post: she decided not to meet with me, and I shouldn't want to be with someone that doesn't want to see me.

Let us continue the journey of healing. It is better being open to a new love than trying to go back to someone that does not want to be with me.",1,1762990117.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I will never hear the sounds that only he makes ever again. I will never see his snout poking out over the window as he screams and yelps at me as I arrive home.

""How's our boy doing?"" Gorna asked as her hooves clopped over the cobblestones of the road leading into the capital.

Five set the reins of the wagon down for a moment as she turned to look into the basket set next to her.

Inside little Ymrias was gently slumbering, his long neck coiled around on his chest as he slept. Over the past few weeks his emerald green scales had slowly started darkening to a more forest color that reminded Five of his mother.

That thought saddened her a bit.

""He's snug as a bug."" She informed her partner as she booped the little Hisstian's nose. ""A sleepy little snake.""

Gorna fell back and then came around on the other side of the wagon, pulling as close as her equine body would allow, and craned over to look in on their little ward. She smiled as she saw him sleeping.

The young Hisstian child had been in their care for a little over eight months now. For the first three of them he'd still been an unhatched egg.

Five still remembered how he'd come into their care.

Still remembered the fire of the village that they'd been a few hours too late to save.

They had seen the smoke on the horizon as they'd been traveling from the northern port town of Adenbrok and begun heading inland toward the Capital. It had been nearly two years since they'd been back in Petravia. They'd only been traveling for about a week when it happened.

Once they'd seen the smoke, seen the worried faces on the refugees running down the road away from them, they'd begun running. They'd left their old carriage behind, telling an injured couple to rest in it and use their supplies to care for their wounds, and help who they could. Gorna's hooves had pounded as Five had sat astride her back, prepping her arbalest and strapping sheathes of daggers to her partner's back and sides.

And they'd been too late.

By the time they'd gotten to the village the local garrison of soldiers had already arrived and managed to repel/defeat the attacking bandit tribe. But the village had been all but destroyed. Disheartened but still morally obligated to help, the duo had set about helping to recover survivors.

That was when they'd ""met"" Ymrias's mother.

They'd found her in what they guessed had been their home. She'd been wounded so badly, burned, and suffocated by smoke, that even healing magic had only bought the woman time, not saved her.

She'd been next to another adult Hisstian and clinging to a child, both already dead.

And she'd been wrapped around an egg that was roughly the size of a football.

""Ymrias."" She'd struggled to tell them as she'd shakingly held the egg out to them. ""His name was going to be Ymrias."" 

Five had gently accepted the egg, cradling it to her chest to protect it from any potential debris as she hastily exited the still smoldering home. Then moments later, as Gorna used magic to ease the woman's pain, she had breathed her last.

They'd asked around over the following days. Spoken to the soldiers, to the scant few survivors of the town. But none had been family to the village's only Hisstians, though they knew them. People in villages as small as this one always knew everyone. Apparently they'd been a resettlement family from the south.

But their lives and families had been destroyed by the bandit raid, and none could afford another mouth to feed, if it even survived to hatching.

The soldiers hadn't been much help either. There was an orphanage in the next nearest town, they'd informed the two of them. But like most orphanages, it was full to bursting. All the orphanages were, the world over. They had been since the sky had tried to kill the world. And even nearly a decade later that hadn't changed.

And so the odd couple of Five, a were-squirrel whose real name was Lambert, and Gorna Daggerdancer, who was a centaur outcast, had become the unexpected caretakers of a Hisstian egg. And three months later the hatchling that had been name Ymrias.

Five didn't believe in gods the way Gorna did. But something about the small reptilian child had felt god-sent to them both.

They'd talked about having children before. But with both of them not only being women, but also vastly different species, it had always been a ""late"" topic. They traveled and lived nomadically by both nature and progression. Especially since Five had been granted the task of exploring this world for Earth's research.

But they'd always considered adoption, or potentially visiting a fertility church and having a complicated ceremony done that sounded to Five like magical I.V.F.

And instead the universe had delivered to them a small Hisstian baby unexpectedly. It had been amidst tragedy. But their bond with the egg, and later the hatchling itself, had felt like some kind of answer to an problem they'd never expected a solution to.

And now he was theirs.

""Awww look at that little cutey."" Gorna said as she moved a bit of his blanket to cover his foot.

Five smiled as she watched the centaur dote on their adoptive child. She loved Gorna, and was so glad they'd met each other. 

""It's been a while since we've been here."" She said as she looked around at the shops and houses and things as they got deeper into the capital. 

They needed to report in to the embassy and offload the hard drives she'd filled with photos, videos, notes, and more on their travels. There were even a few drives devoted solely to the weather and topographical data that had been recorded by several different sensors they'd been given.

But they had other things they wanted to do first. For starters, they'd stopped at the Choi estate and visited the princess. She and her two daughters had been awestruck by the little baby and Princess Amina had congratulated both of them on the new addition to their family, even if it was under unfortunate circumstances.

That had been Gorna's idea, and Five had been okay with it. Even if the centaur was no longer bonded to the princess, the two of them had remained friends and pen-pals over the years.

Now they were on their way to where Five wanted to go before getting saddled with paperwork.

To see her one bit of family she had in this world besides the two with her.

""Should only be around this corner."" She thought as she pulled the wagon around the corner in the street.

Sure enough, Driscoll's Delicacies was right there a few buildings down.

""Oh man."" Gorna said. ""I can already smell the bread. Gods that smells good.""

Five was about to speed the wagon up when, as if on cue, she saw the familiar lanky, red furred, form of her ""sibling"".

She was going to call out, maybe wave her hand or something, when he turned and she saw something... unexpected.

Driscoll turned toward the front door to his bakery and.... smiled.... as he reached out with his hand.

She couldn't remember the last time she'd seen Driscoll smile. 

In fact... she thought she might have never seen it happen before.

Then the person he'd been reaching out to stepped out of the door and took the offered hand.

""Wow. He looks happy."" Gorna said. ""Can't blame him. She's awful pretty for a fox."" Then she stopped as she realized that Five had stopped the wagon without even realizing it. ""Hon'?"" she wondered as she looked back at the wagon.

Ahead of them Driscoll pulled the fellow were-fox into a casual stroll as she wrapped an arm around his waist, the two of them walking further into the city and likely to dinner.

Five smiled as she looked at Gorna.

""Looks like a date."" She said to her partner as she began turning the wagon around.. ""Come on. Let's go to the embassy. We can bug him tomorrow.""

""You sure?"" Gorna asked as she clopped over to join Five, mildly confused. ""He's right there.""

""Yeah."" Five replied. ""We don't wanna interrupt unexpectedly. Besides, one night won't hurt.""

Gorna looked back for a moment, then shrugged and followed next to the wagon.

Five looked over her shoulder for a moment, still smiling.

""Guess we're all finding our people."" She said quietly to herself as she watched Gorna trot over to a vendor and grab a few meat buns for them. Five did feel a little bad, she knew her love had been looking forward to fresh bread and pastries. But it was fine. They'd get some tomorrow.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

""So you... have a kid now?"" Driscoll asked as he awkwardly held Ymrias. Ymrias's brilliant blue eyes stared at Driscoll's intently as he struggled to reach the large were-fox.

Five and Gorna had rang Driscoll's doorbell about an hour before his shop opened and the still groggy baker had been completely surprised by their unexpected appearance.

Now they were sitting in the front room of his bakery, enjoying coffee and snacks as his staff worked to get the shop ready for the day.

""Submitted the official adoption papers as soon as he'd been certified healthy post hatch."" Gorna said after gulping down a mouthful of biscotti. ""He's been ours for a little under eight months now.""

Five grinned as she saw the way Driscoll held the slithery little baby.

""Driz."" She said with a chuckle. ""He's a baby. Not a grenade with the pin pulled. He just wants body warmth."" She mime pulling him in close.

Driscoll looked at her uncertainly, then pulled Ymrias in closer. The little Hisstian coiled his neck up over Driscoll's shoulder as his hands grabbed onto the apron he was wearing. Five mimed putting her arms underneath him, and Driscoll followed suite.

""Now.."" Five said, satisfied that her baby was being held properly. ""Who was that you were with last night?""

Driscoll's eyes went wide as he looked at her.

""What?"" He asked. ""You were here last night?""

""Just for a few minutes."" Gorna said as she chewed on a donut. ""She didn't wanna interrupt date night.""

""You shoulda said something."" Driscoll said, sounding annoyed. Ymrias fussed a bit and he looked at him uncomfortably for a moment before whispering. ""You could've joined us for dinner.""

""You looked happy."" Five said as she continued smiling. ""Didn't wanna risk that.""

This time Driscoll didn't just look uncomfortable, he looked slightly embarrassed.

""I uh..."" He began. ""I am happy."" He said as he considered what they'd probably seen. ""And her name is Kolna. We've uh... we've been together for about four months now."" He gestured at the front door and the line that was slowly assembling outside already. ""She'll probably be here any minute now."" He said as he offered Ymrias back to Five. The little Hisstian hissed lightly, upset that he was being taken from the baker's body heat. ""She likes to grab breakfast here before going to work. She's a teacher nearby.""

Five took the baby and let him snuggle his noodley head into her thick fur as she held him close.

""Well then we'd love to meet the woman who has so improved our uncle Driscoll's life so much."" She said to Ymrias. ""Isn't that right my little wiggle worm?""

""Uncle?"" He wondered. ""We're not-""

""Hey boss!"" A voice called from behind the counter. ""We're ready when the clock strikes."" One of Driscoll's employees called to him.

""Oh shut up Driz."" Five said, still grinning. ""You're close enough. Now open this joint up so we can meet your girl.""

Driscoll's face scrunched as he shook his head while moving toward the front door.

""What's that make Vickers than?"" He asked as he flipped the sign from ""CLOSED"" to ""OPEN"".

""Grumpy Grandpa?"" Five mused with a chuckle.

Driscoll rolled his eyes as he undid the bolt over the door.

""Grumpy grandpa whiskers?"" Gorna wondered, laughing lightly at what the old cat would think of the notion. ""He's gotta be getting annoyed at how big his FAMILY is getting at this point.""

Driscoll smiled and nodded at the first of his customers as they walked in.

And twenty minutes later he was sitting on the couch in the corner, his hand resting on the small of Kolna's back as she met Five and Gorna for the first time and doted on their little baby snake person.

They made an odd mix; three were-folk, two being foxes and one a squirrel, a centaur, and a small Hisstian baby.

Yet both Five and Driscoll liked the sound of calling him Uncle. Even if it didn't make any sense.",6,1762989878.0,GATEhouse,0,1.0,False

""How's our boy doing?"" Gorna asked as her hooves clopped over the cobblestones of the road leading into the capital.

Five set the reins of the wagon down for a moment as she turned to look into the basket set next to her.

Inside little Ymrias was gently slumbering, his long neck coiled around on his chest as he slept. Over the past few weeks his emerald green scales had slowly started darkening to a more forest color that reminded Five of his mother.

That thought saddened her a bit.

""He's snug as a bug."" She informed her partner as she booped the little Hisstian's nose. ""A sleepy little snake.""

Gorna fell back and then came around on the other side of the wagon, pulling as close as her equine body would allow, and craned over to look in on their little ward. She smiled as she saw him sleeping.

The young Hisstian child had been in their care for a little over eight months now. For the first three of them he'd still been an unhatched egg.

Five still remembered how he'd come into their care.

Still remembered the fire of the village that they'd been a few hours too late to save.

They had seen the smoke on the horizon as they'd been traveling from the northern port town of Adenbrok and begun heading inland toward the Capital. It had been nearly two years since they'd been back in Petravia. They'd only been traveling for about a week when it happened.

It works in 2 ways. 1st thing is you probably already recognized all the women at your usual place. 2nd this is if you meet someone and it doesn’t work out there isn’t the awkwardness of seeing them often at your usual place. ",3,1762989564.0,blackmen,6,1.0,False

I’d tell myself I want to feel better, look better, be healthier… but I never actually did anything about it. I’d have these short bursts of motivation, then slip right back into the same patterns.

A few weeks ago something finally snapped in a good way. I was sitting in my kitchen feeling gross after another night of stress-eating, and I just thought… wow, I’m actually tired of feeling this way. Not in a dramatic “new me” kind of way, just genuinely tired.

So I started tiny. Drinking water before coffee. Cleaning my space for 10 minutes every morning. Going for a walk even when I didn’t feel like it. Nothing crazy. And I promised myself I wouldn’t “restart” every time I messed up, I’d just keep going the next day.

The weirdest thing is that the consistency is starting to feel normal. I even signed up for this thing called Minimal because I needed someone to check in on me every week, otherwise I keep drifting. It’s nothing intense, just small goals that I can’t wiggle out of. Having someone ask, “did you do the thing?” weirdly helps.

I’m still nowhere near where I want to be, but for the first time it doesn’t feel impossible. I don’t feel ashamed every time I look in the mirror. I don’t feel like giving up after one bad day.

I just feel... a little bit better than I did last month. And right now, that’s enough.

If anyone else is trying to get it together slowly, I’d love to hear what small habits helped you the most.",1,1762989553.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

1ovkvzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriedAndRated/comments/1ovkvzy/id_forgotten_what_it_felt_like_to_wake_up_with/,I’d forgotten what it felt like to wake up with energy — until coffee actually started working again,"I’ve always been a coffee person.

Two cups in the morning, one around noon, maybe another around three just to survive the rest of the day. It wasn’t even about the taste anymore — it was survival fuel.

But somewhere in my late thirties, that morning buzz stopped working.

I’d drink my usual mug, wait for the kick, and… nothing. I still felt groggy, bloated, heavy — like my body was stuck in low gear no matter how much caffeine I threw at it.

I’m 41 now, married, two kids, desk job. Most days I wake up to an alarm I snooze twice, make breakfast for the kids, rush through emails, then realize I haven’t eaten anything myself until 11 a.m. My jeans started getting tighter, my face looked puffy in pictures, and by evening I was too wiped to even think about exercise.

It wasn’t dramatic — no huge crash, no illness. Just a slow fade.

Less energy, more weight, worse sleep.

I kept telling myself it was “just getting older.”

Then one Saturday, I was standing in line at Starbucks and caught my reflection in the glass.

I looked… dull. Not unhappy, exactly, just drained. My posture was slumped, my skin looked tired, and I remember thinking, When did I start looking like this?

That night, after the kids went to bed, I sat scrolling through Reddit like I always do when I can’t sleep. There was a post in r/loseit where someone around my age said they’d finally broken out of the “coffee-and-crash” cycle. They talked about how metabolism slows down when you live on caffeine and stress, and how balancing it again changed everything.

[They mentioned something called Java Burn — just once, casually — saying they mixed it with their morning coffee to “wake up their metabolism instead of just their brain.” I didn’t think much of it, but the phrase stuck with me.](https://freezegluco.com/Javaburn.html)

https://preview.redd.it/6sw17y7qls0g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=97242d8a1a0f571df749ac76b6a667387a677436

A few days later, after another afternoon crash that left me staring blankly at my computer screen, I decided to give it a shot.

The first few mornings didn’t feel earth-shattering. My coffee tasted the same, and I wasn’t expecting miracles. But by day four, I noticed something small but undeniable: I didn’t need that second cup. My energy felt steady, not spiky. I got through the morning without that familiar mid-day slump.

By the end of the second week, I realized I was waking up before my alarm. That hasn’t happened since my twenties.

The changes were gradual but real. My focus at work came back. My afternoon fog lifted. My clothes started fitting a little looser. My wife even commented one night, “You look more awake lately.”

What surprised me most wasn’t the physical change — it was the mental one.

I started feeling clear. Not jittery or over-caffeinated, just present.

So I kept going. I started walking in the evenings again, not out of guilt, but because I actually had the energy. I stopped skipping breakfast. I began sleeping deeper. The scale slowly moved down — about fifteen pounds over a couple of months — but more importantly, my mornings stopped feeling like battles.

I remember one particular morning in May: I brewed my coffee, opened the windows, and for the first time in years, felt genuinely good.

No fog, no heaviness, no racing thoughts. Just calm energy.

That was the moment I realized I wasn’t tired anymore.

Looking back, I think what really changed wasn’t just metabolism — it was my relationship with routine. Before, I was running on autopilot: caffeine, work, stress, repeat. My body had forgotten how to actually use energy instead of chase it.

Getting that balance back made everything else easier — eating better, moving more, sleeping soundly. Once your body stops fighting itself, the effort finally pays off.

It’s been almost a year now, and mornings are my favorite part of the day again. I still drink my coffee — same mug, same ritual — but now it actually does what it’s supposed to do: wake me up.

I’m down twenty-two pounds since last spring. My mood’s better, my confidence is back, and I don’t dread mirrors or Monday mornings anymore.

Sometimes it’s wild to think something as small as changing how I start my day could shift everything else — but that’s exactly what happened.

I used to think “more coffee” was the answer. Turns out, I just needed my body to remember how to burn fuel again.

And now, every morning, when that first sip hits and I feel that calm, steady lift — I smile. Because for the first time in a long time, my coffee and I are finally working on the same team.",1,1762989391.0,TriedAndRated,0,1.0,False

1ovkt1y,https://i.redd.it/g0jrcqjzrw0g1.jpeg,"🥯 Trying Costco Bagels in Japan (No Oven, No Toaster Life 🍞)","The other day, I went to Costco (in Japan) for the first time and bought a pack of bagels.
(I’m Japanese and live in Japan.)

Since I don’t have a toaster or an oven at home, I actually asked Reddit in my previous post how I should eat them.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/s/nTO2kON0iq

Anyway, I tried several methods, so here are my thoughts 👇

⸻

🥯 First Impression

At first, I thought American bagels looked much denser and heavier than Japanese ones.
But when I actually ate them, the taste wasn’t that different.

Japanese bagels tend to be a bit more chewy, I think.

Some people in the comments said Costco bagels are “fake” because real bagels are boiled before being baked — apparently Costco skips the boiling step.

But honestly, they still taste good 😋

⸻

🍳 How I Cooked Them

Since I don’t have an oven or toaster, I let them thaw naturally.
When I was in a hurry, I used the microwave defrost mode and then toasted them on a frying pan.

A lot of people told me “Just buy a toaster!” but my place is small and I’m a minimalist, so for now, no toaster 😅

Also, I don’t even have a fish grill (which many Japanese stoves usually come with) 😭🐟
But in Japan, especially for single-person households, not having an oven or a fish grill is actually pretty normal!

⸻

💸 About Butter

Many people recommended butter, so I went to the supermarket—
but butter has gotten expensive lately 😭
So I skipped it.
(I also avoid margarine since it seems unhealthy.)

I’m usually a rice person anyway, so I don’t normally keep butter at home 🍚

⸻

🥯 Bagels in Japan?

I wanted to compare Costco’s with Japanese bagels,
but I checked two supermarkets and neither of them sold bagels 😱

I didn’t realize bagels were that uncommon here since I usually eat rice, not bread.

You can get a bagel sandwich at Doutor, a popular Japanese coffee chain,
but honestly, I can’t think of any other places in Japan that have bagels on the menu 🤔

Too bad, I really wanted to do a Japan–US bagel comparison 😢

⸻

😋 Taste Test

Overall, they were pretty good!
Here’s what I tried:

・Olive oil (lots of people said “no,” but I liked it)

・Cream cheese (French one from Costco 🇫🇷)
・Melted cheese

・Melted cheese + honey
・
Plain

All of them were nice, but plain + corn soup was surprisingly good!
Since bagels soak up moisture, the soup really balanced it out.

I also brought one to work and toasted it there — definitely tasted better 😂

Maybe I should get a toaster after all…
But since I rarely eat bread, I’m still not sure.

⸻

I bought a pack of 8 bagels and now I’m already down to the last one.

1ovkrn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerSuccess/comments/1ovkrn9/having_repeated_escalations_from_sales_how_to/,"Having repeated ""escalations"" from Sales - how to help my manager see that this isn't normal?","Hi everyone,

I work in Customer Success at a scale-up, and while I really like both the company and the industry, I’m starting to feel quite drained by the dynamic between our Sales and CS teams — especially the French sales team.

Here’s what’s been happening: whenever there’s the slightest misunderstanding between me and an Account Executive, their Sales Director opens an “escalation chat” on Slack, adding my manager and even the VP of my department, basically saying “this happened.”

It feels unnecessary and aggressive — especially because before these escalations, I often have a friendly, productive chat with the AE where it seems like we’re aligned. Then suddenly, I’m being tagged in an escalation thread. It’s hard to trust that we’re working toward the same goals. It doesn’t feel collaborative; it feels like they’re trying to cover themselves rather than solve issues.

When I talk to my manager about it, she says this kind of escalation is “normal” and just part of how things are done. She also keeps saying that the Sales Director only does this because I haven’t built a strong relationship with him — but that’s not true. I’ve had several coffee chats with him, and whenever I see him, I make an effort to start a friendly conversation. I’ve also made it clear many times that I’m open to feedback and that he can always reach out or schedule a quick call with me.

Despite all that, the pattern continues. I’ve also learned that I’m not the only one on the CS team experiencing this.

To make things trickier, my manager previously had her own conflicts with that same Sales Director, but now she’s trying to smooth things over and cooperate. He keeps telling her she’s “overprotective” of her team, so now it feels like she’s going out of her way to agree with him instead of acknowledging our side.

I’m a transparent, direct person, and pretending this is fine is taking a toll on me — even physically.

How can I help my manager see that this isn’t normal or healthy behavior? I don’t want to escalate further or make things worse, but I also can’t keep pretending it’s fine.

1ovkpll,https://i.redd.it/kthi1jhcrw0g1.jpeg,How to convince boss to get rid of nasty syrup pumps,"I’ve spared you all the picture of the worst pump I’ve seen at our shop, but these are what most of our pumps look like at best. 

Background: we are a local owned coffee shop, we keep a lot of syrups between store bought and house “mixed” (not house made but different store bought syrups mixed together.) We keep them all in 64 oz opaque containers with the capora sauce pumps in them to dispense syrups. Unfortunately these pumps are unable to be taken apart for cleaning as stated by the company. This means we have pumps that are sometimes years old, that we try to clean but physically cannot clean well, that are stained at the very least and I’m convinced some of them have grown mold on the inside (which I made the executive decision to toss without approval.) Our boss usually just says this is because people “don’t clean them properly” which is probably a factor, but when you literally can’t fully clean them what are you supposed to do? 

We are supposed to trial making some syrups in house after years of me asking, but the problem is he wants to keep using the same gross pumps. I dislike them for the syrups we already use, which are filled with all kinds of preservatives, who knows what will grow in them with simple syrups without all that stuff in them preventing things from growing. Right now I’m the only one who knows the recipes to the syrups we tested and liked and at this point I’m contemplating holding them hostage as leverage to get this pump situation fixed. 

My boss is generally kind of avoidant of spending money where he doesn’t have to which I mean is fair in this economy, I know it’s rough out there, but is it really worth possibly giving people food poisoning? 

He also said he’s too worried about other baristas not properly measuring if we got rid of pumps and not cleaning the measuring cups fully between drinks. But in my opinion we should not allow employees to get away with not following proper procedure, not just make it so even they can’t possibly mess it up. 

I can also understand not wanting to be slowed down in a rush, but I have worked at places with way more traffic that pour their syrups and they did just fine. 

I don’t know, I’m really trying to find some points that I can bring up to convince him it’s worth spending a reasonable amount of money to not possibly be contaminating our syrups with mold and who knows what else. ",5,1762988967.0,barista,11,1.0,False
1ovko5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ovko5c/aitah_for_ending_a_friendship_over_dismissal_of/,AITAH for ending a friendship over dismissal of my miscarriage?,"Sorry for the length of this, arguments get lengthy when long term friends go at it I guess. 

I 24F and my friend 21F got into it so bad that I blocked her, we’ve been friends for 3 years. It started with the night before last, I had a 7hr panic attack about my miscarriage three years ago. I am very much not someone to reach out to friends or loved ones when having an episode, I know it’s not fun to hear about but I was really losing it around hour 3/4 of this panic attack. I reached out to my friend just pouring my heart out because I was just so sad for my baby and I feel like I ended their life because I was neck deep in an eating disorder and didn’t even know I was pregnant. I was 20 and stupid and it didn’t even cross my mind that that could be a miscarriage. Once I connected the dots two years afterwards and realized what happened and what I did; it’s just not been fun. 

However. Like I said, I don’t reach out to ppl/let ppl know much about difficult things I’m going through. So when I brought my panicking up to her, her immediate response was along the lines of “that’s probably not what even happened, it could’ve just been a heavy period or your BC being funny, I just feel like you’re traumatizing yourself since that may not have even been what happened”. 

Hey man. I’ve researched myself to the point of insanity trying to see if it could have been something else. ANYTHING else. I was hoping so desperately maybe it was a crazy period, maybe it was my IUD perforating or something, maybe this maybe that but the symptoms I experienced that day can only be aligned with miscarriage, I don’t want to go through the gritty details but that is what it was. 

So I left her on read. I was in such shock at her words I was just speechless. Because of my panic, I didn’t fall asleep until 7/8am. I was awoken at 3pm(out of character for me) to see I had five missed calls, several missed texts, and to top it off my MOTHER asked me why I was sleeping so late bc my friend had texted my whole entire mother about why I wasn’t responding. I was still upset about what she told me regarding my miscarriage last night, and now she’s not only blowing my phone up but involving my mother??? 

I just said “sorry man I’ve been asleep” she says it’s okay, sends me several memes, I leave her on delivered. Didn’t wanna talk. She then quadruple texts me saying “well I’m abt to be otw to get you for coffee or lunch”. We did not plan that. She has asked me to hang out every single day 5/6 days in a row and I even tried to politely decline once but she got pissy as usual so I caved and agreed to hang out despite not being a good headspace. I did not have plans to cave today though. I said I’m sorry dude I’m not feeling good enough to hang today hence why I’m in bed at 3. She just sent back “okay😭”. I left her on read bc end of conversation right? 

No. “I just don’t see how sleeping all day is gonna help either.” Alright dude so after last nights conversation, BLOWING my phone up, involving my mother, now I’m not allowed to have a fucking mental health day? There was so much said but she flew off the handle and the gist is I’m apparently an evil liar and I’ve always been an evil liar, I’m a fake friend, there was SO much name calling(on her side, I don’t stoop that low to people I consider my friends) I mean she called me a dumbass, lying ass bitch, fucking crazy, I don’t do anything good for myself, I need mental help(which she is well aware I have already been receiving, she is not) as well as some very deep personal digs about my relationship with my sister. I told her that I’m sorry this is how our friendship has panned out, and I hope she gets the help she needs. 

I blocked her and was gonna be done with her, I had been tired of catering to her for a long time and this was the shove I needed to finally block her. She expects me to be available to hang out any and every time she asks, if I say no she wants to know exactly why I can’t. Whenever I’m off work she just assumes we’re gonna hang out and gets honestly an attitude when I’m not available every single off day. 

As I said I was gonna leave it at that, but then the texts and calls start rolling in. First my friend of 8 years telling me she messaged him saying “I’m sorry to unadd you but (my name) blocked me and I’m tired of the negativity” then my friend of over a decade calls me and she’s like yoooo what’s going on?? She’s texting me? So now I’m beginning to lose my mind of course. I unblock her to tell her I didn’t run to your friends, I didn’t delete my messages(she deleted several of her messages so I began screenshotting everything before she could delete more), I didn’t call you names like were in middle school, but I’m the negativity? I said if you truly feel like I am too negative to be around, I will make it easy for you and you never have to be around me or my negativity again. She said “girl fuck you” and I said I rest my case. 

I didn’t cuss at her. I didn’t call her names like we’re 12. I didn’t insult her family situation which is arguably worse than mine. And most importantly, I am not dismissive over her life traumas. You can talk sideways to me for a good while and I’ll let it go, but for you to be saying I wouldn’t be a good mother because I get short with my dog sometimes? And I don’t have a good living situation for a child? You will not talk about my dead child like that. That is too far. 

I never directly insulted her but I did text her friends since she wanted to text mine and I simply sent them screenshots of everything she called me. Every insult, every low blow, every jab, and of course that was me being evil and psycho again. Maybe don’t say hurtful things you don’t want others to know about. Instead of trying to talk about the issue at hand, her dismissal of my miscarriage, she jumped straight to attack. 

I’m not even mad at her I’m just disappointed. I kinda knew she wasn’t the best friend but I had always tried to overlook it. But the things she said about how I’d be as a mother, how I didn’t actually have a miscarriage, good fucking bye. ",0,1762988871.0,AITAH,2,0.43,False

I work in Customer Success at a scale-up, and while I really like both the company and the industry, I’m starting to feel quite drained by the dynamic between our Sales and CS teams — especially the French sales team.

Here’s what’s been happening: whenever there’s the slightest misunderstanding between me and an Account Executive, their Sales Director opens an “escalation chat” on Slack, adding my manager and even the VP of my department, basically saying “this happened.”

It feels unnecessary and aggressive — especially because before these escalations, I often have a friendly, productive chat with the AE where it seems like we’re aligned. Then suddenly, I’m being tagged in an escalation thread. It’s hard to trust that we’re working toward the same goals. It doesn’t feel collaborative; it feels like they’re trying to cover themselves rather than solve issues.

When I talk to my manager about it, she says this kind of escalation is “normal” and just part of how things are done. She also keeps saying that the Sales Director only does this because I haven’t built a strong relationship with him — but that’s not true. I’ve had several coffee chats with him, and whenever I see him, I make an effort to start a friendly conversation. I’ve also made it clear many times that I’m open to feedback and that he can always reach out or schedule a quick call with me.

Despite all that, the pattern continues. I’ve also learned that I’m not the only one on the CS team experiencing this.

To make things trickier, my manager previously had her own conflicts with that same Sales Director, but now she’s trying to smooth things over and cooperate. He keeps telling her she’s “overprotective” of her team, so now it feels like she’s going out of her way to agree with him instead of acknowledging our side.

I’m a transparent, direct person, and pretending this is fine is taking a toll on me — even physically.

How can I help my manager see that this isn’t normal or healthy behavior? I don’t want to escalate further or make things worse, but I also can’t keep pretending it’s fine.

Before quitting:  
In the mornings I’d get maybe one to three hours of energy before crashing into mental and physical fatigue. Most days I just wanted to lay down. I felt drained, antisocial, and moody. One minute I’d be energized, the next I was tired and irritable. For about four years I lived that way on mostly energy drinks, and even when I switched to just coffee for the last six months, it was the same cycle.

After quitting:  
My days finally feel consistent. No more ups and downs. I actually have steady energy to talk to people, go places, and live again.

If you’re trying to quit, don’t judge your progress too early. The first few weeks can be rough with lots of ups and downs, but your body and mind will adjust if you give it time.

These kinds of posts motivated me back when I was struggling to quit, so I wanted to return the favor.

It's about a woman who falls asleep in 2023 and reawakens in 1920, confused, medicated. It's around 950 words and format is better on my Reedsy account. 


Prologue - The Bells

Rain tapped the windows as the final minutes of 2023 drifted past Clara unnoticed.

Each drop traced a slow, uncertain path down the glass. The television murmured in the background — low volume, just enough to soften the silence.

Clara sat cross-legged on the sofa, laptop balanced on a cushion, surrounded by notebooks that looked less like research and more like nesting birds. The screen’s glow washed her face in a pale, anxious light as she scrolled through yet another archived article.

The 1920s: a decade of modern miracles and quiet catastrophes.

The words blurred. She blinked hard, realising her eyes had been dry for some time now.

Her research paper — America in Flux: The Year of Transition — was due in two weeks. In truth, she’d been working on it for months. She wasn’t just fascinated by the era; she was haunted by it. It was a time suspended awkwardly between centuries — unsure which future to choose, or which past to mourn.

She reread a note she’d scribbled in the margin earlier:
Progress comes at the cost of certainty.
The cursor blinked beside the sentence, patient, unsympathetic.

On the coffee table sat her nightly companions: a mug of cold coffee, a water glass half-full, and a small orange prescription bottle with a white cap. She twisted it idly between her fingers.

The pills steadied her — supposedly. “They balance the rhythms,” her doctor had said, though the phrasing had always made her uneasy. Like her mind was an instrument slightly out of tune.

Lately nothing felt tuned at all.

Some nights she’d swear the ticking of her wall clock skipped beats, or that the hallway light dimmed too slowly after she flicked it off. Sometimes a shadow would shift just before she turned her head.

Exhaustion, she told herself. Burnout. Too much caffeine. Not enough daylight.

Still, she took the pills at exactly 11:30 PM every night. Routine, she believed, kept her anchored.

She glanced at the clock now.

11:42.

She told herself she’d stay up for the bells — a ritual she’d always kept. Fireworks, renewal, proof that time still moved in a straight, obedient line.

But her body disagreed. Her shoulders slackened; her eyelids drooped. She set the laptop aside and allowed the recliner to claim her.

Outside, the slick wet street reflected passing headlights like ripples of mercury. Somewhere nearby, a premature firework cracked the night.

The TV played on — a rerun of a forgotten sci-fi series. A man in a metallic suit droned about temporal resonance.
Clara smiled weakly. “Temporal resonance,” she murmured. “That’d be nice.”

She closed her eyes.

When she opened them again, she wasn’t sure whether a minute or an hour had passed. The television had dissolved into static.

The ticking clock had grown louder — irregular, like a heartbeat faltering.

Her eyelids dipped; her thoughts drifted. To the Roaring Twenties she’d spent months inhabiting — jazz clubs and suffragettes, grainy film reels, the strange glow of modernity not yet sure of itself.

In that twilight between waking and sleep, she heard a voice — soft, female, brushing her ear:

“You’re almost there.”

Her eyes flew open.

Nothing. Only static hissing like rainfall trapped inside the walls.

“Dreaming,” she whispered. “Already dreaming.”

Ten minutes to midnight.

The house settled. Pipes clicked. A ceiling corner let a small creak. The wind found a seam in the old window frame and whistled through. Clara pulled her blanket tighter.
Inside her mind, the countdown began — not from the TV, but from somewhere deep and private:

Ten… nine… eight…
A pulse throbbed behind her eyes.

Seven… six…
The static shifted into a low chime.

Five… four… three… two…
The air trembled.

One.

BONG.

Her eyes snapped open.

BONG.

The sound was impossibly close — metallic, cavernous. She shot upright; the blanket fell away.

BONG.

Something was different. The room was too cold. Too dark.
She reached for the lamp — her fingers touched not plastic, but instead fabric. An embroidered lampshade. A brass pull-chain.

Her pulse stuttered. The television was gone. The laptop was gone. The digital clock, the charger, the remote — gone.
In their place stood heavy furnishings: dark wood, brass fittings, velvet drapes. Her recliner had become a narrow chaise lounge upholstered in deep plum.

“You’re dreaming,” she breathed. “This is a dream.”

But the air didn’t smell like dreams. It smelled of wax, coal smoke, and the faint sourness of old wallpaper.

She rose, legs trembling. Outside the window, gaslight shimmered through rolling fog. Horses clopped somewhere unseen.

“This… isn’t possible.”

She approached the mirror above the fireplace. Her reflection stared back, but the lighting made her appear almost sepia-toned — like an old photograph not fully developed.

Her breath fogged the glass. “Maybe it’s the pills,” she whispered. “Maybe I fell asleep too fast.”

The thought steadied her — until she caught movement in the reflection. A woman stood behind her.

Pale. Motionless. Blurred, like someone caught halfway between worlds. Clara whirled around. Nothing. Only the chaise, the dim room, and the alien hush of another time.

BONG.

Another chime rolled through the air — deliberate, slow, ancient.

Her hands shook as she pressed her palms to her temples. The edges of the room shimmered like heat rising from a hot road.

“This isn’t a dream,” she whispered. “But it can’t be real.”

And then, from the window — soft, like static:

My parents got divorced when I was ten years old. My dad moved on in a few months and dated a new woman. The same woman he cheated on my mom with when I was four. At first, things were not the greatest, but it wasn't bad. She would make little comets that hurt like little paper cuts. She and my dad would gang up on me and say hurtful things about my shorter hair, my tomboy style, my personality, pretty much everything about me. I started to mask and hide myself in makeup, dress like they wanted me to, and grow out my hair even though I didn't want to. I became the perfect girl for them. I was never enough, though. I knew I wasn't my dad's favorite. The list went: god, her, gym, me…

He always loved the gym(kickboxing), that he skipped my birthday twice to go to a fight. He always goes every day and doesn't put me first. I did kickboxing so he could pay attention to me and notice me. It worked, but I stopped because the pressure got too much. What hurts the most is that he stopped going as soon as she stepped into the photo. He stopped so he could spend more time with her, but he didn't do that for me, so that really hurt. So I forced the fact that she was above me. 

I felt like a ghost in that house. She would walk right past me like I was nothing. Every time I tried talking to her, she would give me one-word answers and talk to my dad about everything. I blended into the walls. I felt like a piece of worthless shit. We used to get coffee together, but she stopped doing that, too. It was like a switch. 

I blended in and kept my mouth shut, and watched.

In September, they broke up, which surprised me because he had a ring for her he even said that she was his soulmate. He is happy about it and is acting like it was a one-night thing and not a three-year relationship. He said he is going to put me first and fix our relationship. The next day, he is smiling and says he is talking to a girl, but they aren’t dating. The next day, they are going on a date. The next day, they are girlfriend and boyfriend. He is doing exactly what he did with his ex-girlfriend. The long calls, saying she is the one, how I will love her. I feel like she is going to be the same as his ex. I don’t want to go through that again. I don't want to meet her and go through the pain. I keep thinking that she is going to try to change me, or I have to hide myself from her. I know she isn’t my dad’s ex, but he is saying the same things about her that he did about his ex. I feel so trapped.

1ovkjrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1ovkjrg/can_a_149_vibration_plate_actually_improve/,⚡ Can a $149 Vibration Plate Actually Improve Lymphatic Drainage? My 30-Day Experience with the PJ PINJIAN Platform,"Okay, confession time: I used to roll my eyes at vibration plates. You know, those wobbly platforms people stand on while pretending it’s a workout? Yeah, I thought it was just another fitness gimmick. But after 30 days with the **PJ PINJIAN vibration plate machine**, I owe it an apology. This thing actually *works*—and not just for toning muscles. It’s helped my **lymphatic drainage**, post-workout soreness, and even my late-night restlessness. And all for around **$149**, which, IMO, is shockingly affordable for what it does.

Ever heard of **vibration therapy**? It sounds high-tech, but it’s basically science-backed micro-movements that stimulate your **lymphatic system**, **muscles**, and **circulation**. And before you ask, no, you don’t need to stand there doing squats for hours. I just step on it, choose my **Bluetooth mode**, and let the machine do its magic while I scroll or sip coffee.

[👉 Check it out here on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3LKnzNP)

# My First Impressions

When I first unboxed the **PJ PINJIAN vibration platform**, I wasn’t sure what to expect. It’s sleek, black, and surprisingly sturdy for something made of high-quality plastic. The **LED display** looks clean, the **Bluetooth speakers** actually sound good, and the **200 adjustable intensity levels** make it super customizable. Plus, with a **440 lb capacity**, it doesn’t wobble or creak under pressure—trust me, I tested that.

The setup was plug-and-play. I literally just connected the cord, pressed the power button, and it started humming quietly. There are **automatic operation modes**, but you can also manually tweak the speed and vibration pattern. The first time I stepped on, I laughed. It tickled. Then about five minutes later, I started feeling my calves and thighs tighten up. By day three, I realized my legs didn’t feel as heavy in the mornings. That’s when I got curious.

# The Lymphatic Drainage Effect

I went down the rabbit hole of **lymphatic system stimulation**. Basically, your lymphatic system doesn’t have a built-in pump like your heart. It relies on muscle movement and gravity to flush toxins and waste. If you sit all day, your lymph flow gets sluggish, which can lead to puffiness, fatigue, and slower recovery.

This **lymphatic drainage vibration platform** helps your body “pump” naturally. Each vibration wave nudges your lymph fluid along, kind of like a deep tissue massage but without the awkward small talk. After using it daily, I noticed less bloating, better digestion, and an overall “lighter” feeling—especially in my legs. It’s not placebo either; there’s solid research linking **vibration therapy benefits** to improved lymph flow and **circulation**.

# Recovery After Workouts

If you lift weights, run, or just get sore from existing (hi, desk workers), this part will grab your attention. The **muscle recovery vibration plate** is no joke. It accelerates recovery by boosting blood flow and helping your muscles flush out lactic acid faster.

I used it after leg day, which usually leaves me walking like a penguin. But after 10 minutes of gentle vibration, my stiffness eased up noticeably. The **200 intensity levels** are great because you can start low and build up. Level 40 feels like a massage. Level 150 feels like a power drill under your feet—in a good way.

Ever wondered whether **vibration plate vs massage gun** works better for recovery? I’ve got both, and honestly, the vibration plate wins on convenience. It targets multiple muscle groups at once, while a massage gun focuses on one spot. For daily use, I’ll pick standing and vibing over manually hammering my quads any day.

# Bluetooth & LED Features I Didn’t Expect to Love

Let’s talk about the fun stuff. The **Bluetooth connectivity vibration machine** pairs quickly with my phone, so I play a podcast or chill playlist while standing on it. It makes sessions way more enjoyable. The **LED mode display** shows the timer, speed, and mode, so I can switch up my sessions easily.

There are even **automatic vibration programs** that alternate intensity and frequency to keep your body guessing. It’s like having a mini trainer built into the machine—minus the yelling.

# The Subtle Benefits No One Talks About

The obvious perks are **cellulite reduction**, **muscle tone**, and **improved circulation**, but there are a few unexpected ones too. After two weeks, I noticed my posture improved. My core stayed more engaged throughout the day, probably from the micro-adjustments my muscles made while balancing on the plate.

And stress? Gone—or at least reduced. The gentle hum and rhythm of the **vibration platform** have a surprisingly calming effect. It’s basically **vibration therapy for stress reduction**, and I often use it before bed. Some nights I even combine it with stretching or **evening relaxation vibration therapy**, and I sleep like a rock.

# Real Talk: Does It Help With Cellulite?

That’s the million-dollar question, right? In my experience—yes, but gradually. By the end of the month, my thighs looked smoother. Nothing drastic, but enough for me to notice. The constant **vibration therapy** helps **circulation improvement**, which supports **cellulite reduction** over time. Combine that with hydration and a clean diet, and you’ll definitely see a difference.

So, while it’s not magic, it’s a legit **circulation improvement device** that supports visible results if you’re consistent.

# For Every Type of User

This isn’t just for fitness enthusiasts. My mom, who’s in her 60s, uses it for **joint mobility enhancement** and balance training. She swears her knees feel better. Meanwhile, my friend who works from home stands on it during conference calls to fight off stiffness.

It’s a true **beginner-friendly vibration plate**. You don’t need to be athletic to benefit from it. Whether you’re an **athlete**, **busy professional**, **senior**, or someone who just wants a **daily wellness routine**, this **home vibration plate machine** adapts to you.

And because it’s compact, it slides right under the couch or bed. Perfect **space-saving home gym equipment**.

# PJ PINJIAN vs Bluefin

A lot of people compare **PJ PINJIAN vs Bluefin**, and I’ve tried both. Bluefin looks flashier, but PJ PINJIAN offers better value for money. You get the same **440 lb capacity**, **Bluetooth features**, and **multiple automatic modes** for about half the price. Plus, the **quiet motor** and **durable plastic construction** make it a winner for apartment living.

Honestly, if you’re just getting into **vibration therapy**, PJ PINJIAN gives you pro-level performance without the intimidating setup.

# How I Use It Daily

Here’s my 30-day routine that worked wonders for me:

* **Morning (5–10 min):** Start at level 30 while sipping coffee to wake up the body.
* **Post-workout (10 min):** Level 80–100 to speed up **muscle recovery acceleration**.
* **Evening (10 min):** Low setting (around level 20) for relaxation and lymph drainage.

You can also use resistance bands with it for light toning. The subtle balance challenge activates stabilizer muscles, which is great for **bone density stimulation** and **balance improvement training**.

# A Few Quick Tips

* Always stand barefoot or in thin socks for better grip.
* Keep your knees slightly bent to avoid jarring.
* Start with shorter sessions and build up gradually.
* Combine with hydration and stretching for best results.
* Don’t overdo the high settings—trust me, level 200 feels like a mini earthquake.

# Final Thoughts

After 30 days, I’m honestly impressed. The **PJ PINJIAN vibration plate machine** didn’t just make my recovery smoother—it improved how my whole body feels. I’m less stiff, my circulation’s better, and my legs look and feel lighter.

For $149, it’s one of the most **budget-friendly wellness investments** I’ve made. It’s quiet, compact, and beginner-friendly, yet powerful enough for athletes. Whether you want **lymphatic drainage**, **pain relief**, or **stress reduction**, this thing covers all bases.

Would I recommend it? Absolutely. Especially if you’ve been curious about **vibration therapy** but don’t want to splurge on a $400 machine. This one delivers results that feel both immediate and long-term.

1ovkhpu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ovkhpu,Suggestions?,"Hi everyone, attached are the pictures of my home with the inspiration photos. Some goals I have for my living room is to add more color (I am thinking burnt orange)? I want to keep with the earthy/western vibe for the living room.

Second, is my kitchen. In the future I want to repaint/redo the cabinets and paint the walls a different color. Right now I am thinking either walls a sage green color or cabinets green. I hate the color currently. I like farmhouse style but I am struggling what to do… I think I will change the blue photo for some different art, and I want to change how I have above the cabinets decorated. (Or should I leave it empty?). II think I also want to redo the kitchen table. Maybe add a valance to the window? Above my dishwasher I want to add a coffee bar but not sure how I can cover the phone cable. (Ideas?)

Bedroom: I don’t mind the bedroom but I think the decor is lacking. Again, farmhouse/western vibe. Any suggestions to make this room more lively?

Help.,"I (F23) started a new job in August and pretty soon after met one of my coworkers (M31). We shared a charged glance and from that moment on our attraction to each other grew. He asked me to lunch casually and platonically and it went well. Our feelings started to develop as we had flirty banter and he started doing little things for me (bringing me sweet treats, coffee, etc.) to show me he liked me and I very receptive to it. He eventually asked me on a date and when I went on it with him…Only to discover he wasn’t anything like what he seemed at work.

He had very misogynistic views on women that he fearlessly expressed to me “men and women aren’t equal” “feminism is bullshit” “I prefer submissive women” “I like you because you don’t give me a headache like those other girls”. He told me he only dates girls 18-25 because they “aren’t as scarred.”He would ask me questions and respond to my answers with “good answer” or “bad answer.” Very red flag behavior. He was also very aggressive at times, said demeaning things to me out of the blue when I thought we were otherwise having a good time. I felt as if he was testing me often. It was all very confusing for me. I expressed my concerns with him and was met with complete disregard “you can walk home if you have a problem with me.” I realized he has two sides to him, one that faces the world that is polished and kind and sweet and the one that is darker and only comes out when we are alone. 

I was devastated because I had developed real feelings for someone who wasn’t as they appeared. My head and my heart were severely conflicted. After about three dates (which i know isn’t a lot but it meant a lot to me) and seeing his character clearly I told him I’m not interested in pursuing things romantically. He seemed annoyed and disappointed but understood and we let it be. I was already hesitant and guarded with him because of our age difference, the fact that we are coworkers, and in general because i’m very inexperienced in love. It really hurt me to have to deny our connection because the last time i felt this much attraction to someone I was 15. It never happens for me. 

It’s been about a month since we’ve been together but we still see eachother daily if only for brief moments. We are kind and cordial and in some instances teetering on the edge. I still have feelings for him. I have been trying to put myself out there and meet new people because I thought maybe i’m only fixated on this guy who I know it’s not good for me because I haven’t been with many men at all or even romantically connected with them.

I just don’t know how to proceed. He consumes my thoughts daily. Meeting other people has been going well but it’s difficult to compare to the instant connection I had with him. Any advice on how to stop thinking about him? How should I navigate the situation to minimize my obsessive thoughts? What would you do if you me?

**Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bookies’ BFF?**  
The NHL books are throwing their weight behind the New Jersey Devils, who are favored at decimal odds of 1.65-1.68 (implying a 57-60% chance to win) over the pesky Chicago Blackhawks (odds: 2.2-2.3). The Devils are also giving up 1.5 goals on the spread (-150 to -160), while the total goals line hovers around 6.0-6.5. Bettors craving chaos might eye the **Over 6.0/6.5 goals** (odds: 1.82-2.10), given both teams’ offensive firepower.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Streaks, and a 20-Year-Old Genius**  
The Devils, fresh off an eight-game winning streak snapped by the Avalanche, are led by Jack Hughes (10 goals, 18 points), who’s as reliable as a coffee maker in the morning. Goaltender Jacob Markstrom, returning from a lower-body injury, made a shaky 34-save performance in his last start, allowing 8 goals. Let’s just say his save percentage (.810) isn’t exactly the steel door it used to be—more like a screen door with a “Welcome” mat.

Meanwhile, the Blackhawks are riding a three-game win streak, fueled by 20-year-old phenom Connor Bedard, who’s on an eight-game point streak (18 points) and looks like he’s playing a highlight-reel video game on hard mode. Bedard’s 25 points (9 goals, 16 assists) in 16 games make him the team’s offensive engine, and his “not too high, not too low” mindset is basically a zen master in skates. Chicago’s defense? Well, they’re allowing 3.1 goals per game (24th in the league), which is like leaving your front door unlocked in a mugging capital.
