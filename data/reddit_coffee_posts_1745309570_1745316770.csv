1k52p54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1k52p54/fed_up_with_my_brotherinlaws_gluttony/,Fed up with my brother-in-law’s gluttony,"We just spent a long holiday weekend with my brother-in-law (BIL, age is mid-thirties) and his girlfriend.

BIL is about 5’7” and weighs around 210 lbs. Before starting GLP-1-based weight loss treatment last year, he was about 250 lbs. His goal at the time was to use the drug to change his eating habits for a year, lose weight, and then stop taking it---despite what I understand are medical recommendations to stay on it long-term (at least in the Ozempic/Wegovy world).

At first, I was genuinely impressed by how much the medication changed his behavior. He was committed. The weight came off quickly, and he stopped gorging himself like he used to. But now? It feels like everything is back to how it was. He’s stuffing his face again, just with the meds still trying to fight the uphill battle. I usually keep my mouth shut---it’s not really my place and business. Plus, my husband voices his concerns often enough in a very unambiguous way (we try not to be enablers around BIL), and I think that’s sufficient.

But this weekend was just so fucking hard.

We rented an Airbnb together and did a mix of eating out and cooking in while doing day trips. BIL is all about the food. Breakfast, lunch, dinner---every meal is a full-blown feast. And between meals (or sometimes while cooking), he’ll demolish a full bag of chips or crack open cookies before breakfast. One day we went to a bakery to pick up a cake for later, had a coffee there, and even though we had plans to go home and eat cake, he ordered two slices at the shop.

Don’t get me wrong---I love to eat too, especially on vacation. But with BIL, it’s just too much. My husband and I are constantly trying to keep our bellies in check (we’re 145 lbs at 5’7” and 180 lbs at 5’8”). We’re fit, but overeating is a weakness for both of us.

BIL is just on such an extreme end of the spectrum that it honestly pushes me over the edge. And yes, that probably says more about me than it does about him. But it’s *so* triggering. I came home from what was technically a nice weekend just feeling totally exhausted. It’s like watching your alcoholic uncle crack his first beer at 8 am.

I know BIL checks a lot of boxes for food addiction. Except the secrecy or shame part. He’s not even slightly ashamed. And honestly? I don’t think he’s going to make it. I don’t know if the GLP-1 isn’t working anymore, or if something’s off with the dosage or whatever. I’ve seen so many success stories online, so who knows.

I do love BIL of course---this family means a lot to me.

1k52onz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1k52onz/new_to_dragon_age_completed_veilguard_first_70/,New to dragon age - completed Veilguard first (70 hours) now playing Inquisition (87 hours and counting) - here are my thoughts,"First off, I’ll (F31) start by saying I never used to consider myself a gamer. Baldur’s Gate 3 and playing D&D these past three years was my introduction to the community of RPGs - before, I only played the Civilisation franchise.

To start off, I initially wasn’t a fan of the gameplay, as I was used to turn based combat, that worked well with a laptop keyboard. But a friend set me up with a PS controller for Veilguard and then showed me how to do it for Inquisition, and now I’ll never go back.

As a DA newbie, fresh off a BG3 high, I really enjoyed Veilguard. The visuals were really cool, I enjoyed how snarky my Rook could be without causing too much offense, and as someone who is on the autism spectrum, I liked the handholding when it came to dialogue choices and knowing the consequences of picking different options.

I also romanced Lucanis, despite initially vibing Neve, because he reminded me of a Sicilian, coffee drinking, long dark haired friend - plus I enjoyed the brooding but essentially vulnerable vibes of the romance. I didn’t go into the game with any expectations for romance either, so I found the relationship quite tender and fun.

In many ways, playing this game felt like a high point for me in terms of gaming and I enjoyed it even more than BG3. So much so that it was my obsession for the weeks that I devoured it in and *all* my friends knew about it :’)

Then I played Inquisition. And damn. Now I understand the Veilguard hate.

It’s night and day between the games - there is depth and variety that I wasn’t expecting. Choices feel genuinely free - I don’t feel railroaded at all. The Solas romance, knowing the outcome, feels so much more high stakes. I can spend hours just running round a desert wondering whether I can climb random cliffs and loot goblining to my heart’s content.

Look. I’m not eloquent enough to put this feeling down in words. But I’m obsessed.

TLDR: Veilguard is great as a standalone game, and feels like a strong entry that can live up to other contemporary games like BG3. Inquisition is a step above in every sense of the word, but now I’m glad I can appreciate it going the wrong way round the franchise. Also, apparently I’m now a gamer girl.

I own and run a cafe literally right on the sea. We get huge fluctuations in temperature over the course of a day and it effects our ability to extract coffee consistently.

We probably waste around 5-15 pucks of coffee every day, making sure our shots are extracting properly.

I have two questions.

1) Can anyone point me a an excellent guide about how to dial in a espresso shot in the most economical way possible, our way works fine, but if i can save a few pucks evey day that would be amazing.

2) Our supplier has suggested that we invest in a temperature controlled grinder to help with minimising fluctuations. What would you suggest, i have no experience with any temperature controlled grinders, we currently is a f64 fierenzetto (apologies for poor spelling)

Any and all help appreciated.

1k52o37,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1k52o37/trip_report_18_days_in_vietnam/,Trip report - 18 days in Vietnam,"Since this sub was so helpful when I (solo 43F) planned my itinerary, I thought I’d give back to the community with a trip report - hopefully someone will find it useful! I like my itineraries fairly packed (which I think will be clear from the below), but I genuinely didn’t feel rushed at all during this trip - obviously everyone likes a different pace so YMMV.

TLDR: it was amazing. Go to Vietnam.

Wednesday 2 April - flew out of London (direct flight with Vietnam Airlines).

Thursday 3 April - landed in Ho Chi Minh City early afternoon. Took a taxi to the service apartment I had booked in Japan Town (INDO Serviced Apartment) and walked around the area. It’s definitely a red light district, which could put some people off, but it really was absolutely fine and I never felt unsafe. The apartment itself wasn’t amazing, it looked nothing like the pictures online, but it did what it needed to do, it was cheap and I only saw one live cockroach inside. Worked out in the gym attached to the apartment, went for a massage in the evening and discovered that supermarkets in that part of town sell melonpan, which made me very happy.

Friday 4 April - explored District 1. Worked out that the way to cross the street is “have faith”, strolled around Ben Thanh market, took a look at Notre Dame Basilica (from the outside because it was temporarily closed when I went), the Central Post Office, went to the War Remnants Museum (terrible pictures but I think important to see/not forget). Went to the zoo and wished I hadn’t. Went for a run on the treadmill (which I really dislike but running outdoors in Ho Chi Minh City didn’t seem as easy/straightforward as in other places). In the evening I had a food tour with XO Tours and it was absolutely fantastic - very strongly recommended (in particular as they take you outside of District 1) and I wish I’d booked their other tours too! 

Saturday 5 April - kept exploring Ho Chi Minh City. Went to the Jade Emperor Pagoda, Tan Dinh market and Phu Chau floating temple (the latter is a bit out of the way but easily reachable with a Grab bike and, I thought, worth visiting). In the evening I had a tasting menu at Anan Saigon - good but not mind-blowing, but the relaxed atmosphere and the chilled bartender made it worth it.

Sunday 6 April - took a day trip combining the Cu Chi tunnels and Mekong delta. Discovered coconut candy and my life changed.

Monday 7 April - flew to Da Nang then went straight to Hoi An. Had my first egg coffee and my life changed (and that’s even before I tried salted coffee, which ended up being my favourite). Stayed at Maison Hai Homestay and it was fantastic. Had a lovely evening food tour with a company called Hoi An Food Tour, ate lots of delicious food and played a hilarious game of traditional Vietnamese bingo. 

Tuesday 8 April - Had a great early morning run along the river (we’re talking 5 am. Any later is way too hot already) and took a day trip to the old imperial city in Hue. The tomb of the last king (which we visited in the afternoon) was my favourite spot.

Wednesday 9 April - took an early morning trip to My Son sanctuary and Marble mountain - the 5:30 am departure was worth it to beat the crowds and the heat. Really enjoyed the sanctuary, the ruins look stunning. Chilled in Hoi An in the afternoon and went to a local gym to work out (Superfit Hoi An Fitness and Yoga - easy to get a day pass, good equipment, lockers, sells water, small towel provided to wipe equipment down but not convinced by the showers so I showered back at my homestay). Bought an extra “Fjallraven” bag to store all the coconut candy I bought on the Mekong delta day trip. 

Thursday 10 April - flew from Da Nang to Ha Noi. Explored the Old Quarter. Had my first Bun Cha and my life changed. Stayed in the Silk Grand Premium Hotel and Spa - it was neither premium nor grand but it did the job. Had a great massage in the evening. 

Friday 11 April and Saturday 12 April - early morning run around Hoan Kiem lake. Left my luggage at the hotel in Ha Noi and took a 2D/1N trip to Ninh Binh. This was the highlight of my trip (so far! Little did I know that my mind would be irreversibly blown only a few days later). Went to the Mua caves (do not go into the Tiger Cave! It was just an ankle-deep pond inside and you can’t see a thing, so I ended up with wet socks and shoes), a stunning bird sanctuary at sunset, biked around Tam Coc and through rice paddies, visited a local market in the morning, did the Trang An boat trip and unexpectedly stayed overnight in a gorgeous resort which was way more luxurious than what I’m used to (Lalita resort). Got back to Ha Noi mid-afternoon on the second day.

Sunday 13 April - Spent morning and early afternoon in Ha Noi. Did a really interesting tour called “Stories from Vietnam war at not-to-go-alone areas”. Discovered avocado ice cream in a tall glass of avocado smoothie (at Cafe Kem Bo Xuka) and my life changed. Left my big luggage at what was going to be my next hotel in Ha Noi, packed a small bag and boarded a bus to Ha Giang at 4 pm. 

Monday 14 April to Thursday 17 April - premium 4D/3N Ha Giang loop with Road Kings and MY LIFE FUCKING CHANGED FOREVER. Nothing I have ever done comes close. Everything I did next was shit in comparison. I cried my heart out when it was over and, as I’m typing this on my flight back home, I’m seriously depressed. I was in a group of 9 and we bonded right away. The views were out of this world (the weather was absolutely perfect for the 4 days and visibility was excellent). The food was amazing. The camaraderie was incredible. I had an easy rider and he was the absolute best. I would go back to Vietnam in a heartbeat just to do the loop again and, if/when I do, it will 100% be with Road Kings again.

Friday 18 April - got back to Ha Noi around 2 am. The sleeper bus wasn’t as bad as I was led to believe (although it was certainly an experience) and we did have a rest stop (I’d heard horror stories of buses not stopping on the way. I’m glad mine did). Checked into the hotel where I had left my luggage (Golden Rooster - really nice, staff absolutely outstanding, would definitely return) and crashed for the night. Went to the Vietnamese Women’s Museum (really nice), the Temple of Literature and had a lunch tasting menu at Gia (not worth it. My life definitely did NOT change). Had a lovely evening run around Hoan Kiem lake.

Saturday 19 April and Sunday 20 April - went for an early morning run around the lake, then did a 2D/1N Lan Ha bay cruise. It wasn’t too busy although it was fairly overcast. Went with Venezia Cruise - by no means luxurious but the boat was fine, the bed was super comfortable and the views from the cabin obviously really cool. Food was a let down because it very clearly catered to westerners and therefore lacked flavour. Lan Ha bay was gorgeous but I personally preferred Ninh Binh. Back in Ha Noi mid-afternoon on the second day, wandered aimlessly to try and soak in everything I could and lamenting my impending departure.

Monday 21 April - flew home, utterly heartbroken. 

I didn’t expect it but I fell so hard in love (and not just with my easy rider). Normally at the end of a trip I feel ready to go home, but this time it feels like I am actually grieving and I am so, so sad to be returning to real life.

Lockhart?","I read ""Family of Liars"" right after ""We Were Liars"" and... I'm conflicted. Having been blown away by how much I love ""We Were Liars"", the prequel fell very flat. The tone, vibes, and characterizations of the aunts/sisters was consistent in ""Family of Liars"" but the whole story seemed rooted in only subverting expectations and shock value of the next big ""twist"". The character's choices seems so poorly fleshed out and inconsistent with how their arc develops in ""Family of Liars"". I'm so disappointed!

""We Were Liars"" was good because of the unique characters and the robustness of their personalities. Johnny is bounce, effort and snark; Mirren is sugar, curiosity, and rain; Gat is contemplation, ambition and strong coffee. These traits are fully expanded upon throughout the story. Each character is fully drawn out and makes sense! As a reader, they feel special.

""Family of Liars"" was an attempt to expand upon the mothers of the ""Liars"" in ""We Were Liars"". Hence, I was expecting to know more about the presumably complex relationships between Carrie, Penny and Bess. Perhaps something like the charming dynamics of Johnny, Gat, Mirren and Cadence.....

However, it's become obvious that ""Family of Liars"" doesn't care about their characters. It only cares about the protagonist. I just couldn't care about the other significant characters that drive the story. <spoiler>There was no complexity in Lor Pfefferman, a major character throughout the story that adds significantly to Carrie's introspection and growth/demise. He was just a one dimensional piece of shit, selfish almost-rapist that deserved to die. The drawn out complicated feelings of Carrie didn't matter because he was just a disgusting character with no redeeming qualities or enough self-awareness to make meaningful decisions to add greyness to their relationship. Who cares that Carrie was in love with him for a significant portion of the book? Who cares that Pfefferman almost had a compelling backstory that would make his final act more tragic? The ""final twist"" didn't matter because I already didn't care for him throughout the book. He was just a piece of shit through and through with no thought processes behind any of his choices and values.  </spoiler>

I gotta say, there were indeed attempts for complex character development - <spoiler>Carrie's selfless protector to selfish murderer development, Pfefferman's ABANDONED selfawareness, Penny's vacillation between loving sister to psychotic selfish narcissist </spoiler>.

I (29M) was out shopping with my fiancé (27F) and while we were lining up to get a coffee, I felt a tap on my shoulder and turned around to see the girl I was head over heels for in high school (29F).

Just for a bit of background, I never dated this person, but everyone in our friendship circle (including her) were very aware of my feelings towards her, which is now quite embarrassing to look back on, because I wasn't aware how obvious it was to EVERYONE at the time. I did ask her out a date on one occasion, but she politely declined, and we stayed friends for another 12 months until that entire circle drifted apart naturally. But for several years, this girl was the (very much unrequited) love of my life and my absolute dream person.

Anyway, so cut to over a decade later, I'm very happily engaged to a wonderful person I'm planning on spending the rest of my life with. But instead of handling myself with any grace, immediately upon seeing this girl my heart starts raaaacing and I was stumbling over my words and barely making any sense, while still trying to be funny. I don't even know why I got so nervous, but it was so unexpected and I was overcompensating and getting more anxious realising how obvious it was I was uncomfortable. 

So we had a brief, brutal chat, parted ways and then I was just left with my fiancé who went very quiet for the rest of our time out, until we were driving home about half an hour later, when she told me ""I've just never seen you like that in my life"".

I tried explaining that it was just a shock and I don't know what came over, but things are still weird between us right now. Any suggestions?

If you're an AS student, you can do the same. Here it is:

### 🧠 **High-Scoring Essay Format (AO1, AO2, AO3)**

---

## **I. Introduction (1 short paragraph)**
- **Define** key term(s) from the question.
- Briefly **explain the relevance** to the question being asked.
- State your **overall argument** or suggest your final evaluative position.

> Example:  
> *Marginal utility theory attempts to explain how consumers make choices about how much of a good to purchase, based on the satisfaction (or utility) gained from each additional unit consumed. It provides one explanation for why demand curves slope downward. However, whether it fully explains the relationship between price and demand remains debatable.*

---

## **II. Core Explanation (AO1 + AO2) – 2 to 3 paragraphs**

Each paragraph should:
- Make **one main point** (e.g., law of diminishing MU, equi-marginal principle, etc.)
- Include clear **definitions** of key terms.
- Provide **realistic examples** (e.g., Coca-Cola, apples, housing).
- Where relevant, include **diagrams** (label them clearly).
- Explain the **logical link** between the concept and price/quantity demanded.

### 🔹 Structure for each paragraph:
**Point → Explain → Example/Diagram → Link to question**

> **Example Point**:  
> *The law of diminishing marginal utility suggests that the more of a good a consumer consumes, the less additional satisfaction they gain.*  
> **Explanation**: This explains why consumers are only willing to buy additional units at lower prices...  
> **Diagram**: Include an MU curve or a demand curve derived from MU.  
> **Link**: Therefore, this theory helps explain why demand curves slope downward.

---

## **III. Evaluation (AO3) – 2 to 3 paragraphs**

Each paragraph should:
- Raise **one limitation or counterpoint** of the theory.
- **Explain why** it weakens the theory’s explanatory power.
- Where possible, use **examples** or real-world illustrations.
- End with a **mini-conclusion** (e.g., *thus, while useful, the theory is incomplete*).

### 🔹 Structure for each paragraph:
**Critique Point → Explain → Example → Judgement/Weighing**

Common evaluation points for demand theories:
- Unrealistic **assumptions of rationality**.
- **Bounded rationality** and imperfect information.
- **Advertising and social norms** influencing demand.
- **Inability to explain Giffen/Veblen goods**.
- **Income/substitution effects not accounted for**.
- **Utility of money is not constant**.

> Example:  
> *A key limitation of marginal utility theory is its assumption that consumers behave rationally and can accurately evaluate utility.*  
> *In reality, many decisions are impulsive or influenced by branding and peer pressure.*  
> *For instance, people may buy overpriced coffee due to habit or social cues rather than marginal satisfaction.*  
> *This weakens the theory’s applicability to real-world markets.*

---

## **IV. Conclusion (1 short paragraph)**
- **Summarise** the strengths and weaknesses of the theory.
- Provide a **reasoned judgement**.
- If appropriate, mention **what could make the theory stronger** or when it works best.

> Example:  
> *Marginal utility theory provides a useful foundation for understanding consumer demand and the downward-sloping demand curve. However, its assumptions of rationality and measurability of utility limit its real-world applicability.

1k52gfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/badphysics/comments/1k52gfy/quantum_mysticism_needs_a_reset_time_crystals/,"Quantum Mysticism Needs a Reset: Time Crystals Aren’t New Physics, and Time Still Exists","I’ve been watching two increasingly popular ideas float around the edges of mainstream physics:
	1.	Time crystals are a new phase of matter.
	2.	Time doesn’t actually exist.

I think both need to be taken behind the theoretical barn and put out of their overhyped misery.

⸻

Punch One: Time Crystals Aren’t Exotic—They’re Classical Systems in Drag

Let’s be blunt: if a system requires precise, periodic energy input to maintain its behavior, it’s not self-sustaining, and it’s sure as hell not a new phase of matter. That’s just a finely tuned non-equilibrium oscillator.

And if it can:
	•	tolerate some energy leakage,
	•	continue pulsing under driving,
	•	and then collapse once perturbed or observed,

…then congratulations, you’ve just reinvented a classical resonator in a lab coat and quantum perfume.

They call it “many-body localization” protecting the structure.
But that only works if and only if you keep the kick going.

So let’s not pretend this is some revolutionary break from classical physics.
It’s metastable resonance wearing a fancy grant proposal.

⸻

Punch Two: Time Exists—Sorry to the Block Universe Fans

The “time isn’t real” crowd makes some fun points. I’ve read Rovelli. I’ve seen the entropy arguments, the loop quantum gravity papers, and the block universe theorists standing smugly on their frozen timelines.

But here’s the thing:
	•	My coffee still gets cold.
	•	Your body still ages.
	•	Causality still works.
	•	Entropy still climbs.

Denying time because it’s weird in the math is like denying gravity because your equations don’t include a floor. It’s intellectually fashionable, but empirically hollow.

Is time complicated? Hell yes.
Is it emergent in some models? Sure.
But nonexistent? That’s just epistemological escapism.

⸻

Conclusion: Enough with the Quantum Theater

Let’s call a spade a spade.
	•	Time crystals? Delicate classical systems in quantum makeup.
	•	Time nonexistence? Philosophy disguised as physics.

I’m not against bold ideas. I’m against bad branding and underdone metaphysics being sold as cutting-edge science.

1k52gab,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1k52gab/hypersensitivity_as_a_possible_cause_for_insomnia/,Hypersensitivity as a possible cause for insomnia (my story),"Back in 2013 I started treating myself to a single, small French‑press coffee each morning. The boost was unreal - like flipping on a turbo switch nobody else seemed to have. The downside showed up fast: after a few weeks I needed half an hour (or more) to fall asleep and I was waking before the alarm. A three‑day caffeine break fixed it, so I filed myself under “caffeine‑sensitive” and moved on.

Fast‑forward to 2024. After a routine procedure with local anaesthetic, my caffeine tolerance crashed. Even half a cup kept me wired until 2 a.m. and popping up at dawn.

**Then came the real kicker**: repainting a few metal shelves in my hobby garage with a solvent‑based primer and enamel. Four half‑litre cans over several days, doors and windows wide open. Two days in, my sleep imploded. It took 2‑3 hours to drift off and I was wide‑awake by 5 a.m. Melatonin and OTC sleep aids - zero help.

That’s when it clicked: my nervous system isn’t just sensitive to caffeine, it’s hypersensitive in general. High‑VOC paint fumes were basically acting like mega‑caffeine. I stopped working in the garage and ditched coffee altogether. Within a week I was back to lights‑out at 22:30 and waking around 06:30.

Why share this? If you’ve tried every sleep hack and still can’t switch off, look at chemical exposure or drug sensitivity - caffeine, solvents, fragrances, whatever’s in your environment. Our bodies don’t all play by the same rulebook.

At first I thought Reddit was down, but as soon as I disconnected the VPN and refreshed, everything worked normally. Now I’m wondering—should I be hiding the fact that I’m using a VPN while on Reddit? Like, does Reddit flag certain IPs or block content based on VPN use? I don’t think I’m doing anything shady, just trying to be safe, but it feels like using a VPN sometimes creates more friction than it’s worth.

1k52cnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k52cnx/do_i_need_all_this/,Do I need all this?,"I’m relatively new to home espresso but due to adhd have taken a deep deep dive and loving every tangent taken to the extremes.  I’m a huge James and Lance and Toms coffee fan. 

One thing I quickly noticed is the idea of simple espresso (see the latest Gaggia promo video where the barista levels with their finger) is at odds with the “you need three leveling tools and a spritz” crowd. 

Full disclosure: I use three leveling tools and a puck screen.

I understand that one’s approach to espresso a very personal thing. However adding SO many variables (temp, flow, pre, time, bars, ratio) makes “getting it right” elusive, let alone getting it right more than once (god shot). 

As a disclaimer, I’m an idiot. My like beans black and oily, I put a shot of hazelnut into my daily Cortado. I’ll occasionally drink a straight shot to see how close I am to a god shot lol. My espresso machine and grinder (Casabrews and Shandor - very happy with both) set me back a whopping $150 TOTAL. 

Like I said I’m an idiot and got caught up in upgrade-itus. I got the bottomless filter and a high end basket. I recently got a used GCP with the intent of modding it with Gagguino or Gaggiamate. 

But as I’m looking at PIDs and 12bar vs 9bar and round displays vs rectangle it hit me… why?

I love the ritual in the mornings. Weigh, grind, tamp, pull, steam. It’s a lot but I’m retired and have the time and desire. 

The only variables I can currently control are grind size and shot time. 

My wife literally giggles as I bring her an espresso con pana in the morning. So I’m doing something right. 

I’m now debating whether I need more variables to chase and will that make anything, including the process, better. 

I guess if I had to sum this all up into a question it would be: does the challenge of more variables to dial in, make the experience more enjoyable, more often?

I'd be super grateful if people could let me know of things I could try adding/doing/changing in the cyanotype process that could help me create more abstract or funky or visually interesting cyanotypes!

Examples of stuff I've already tried:
I'm planning on trying the wet cyanotype technique where you add things like salt and tumeric and bubbles to the cyanotype paper whilst it is still drying to create interesting effects.
I've also tried a bit of bleaching and toning with coffee, green tea and black tea. (Any other ideas of ways to alter colouring or create nice colour effects would be much appreciated)
I've tried putting glass items on top of the cyanotype paper, and I have also tried putting a sheet of glass/acetate on top of the paper, splashed water across this, and put the UV light at an angle, so that the shadows of the water-edges are printed (hope that makes sense - I can't tell if that's worded unclearly or not...)

Are there any things you have added/can add to cyanotypes to create cool effects? I am pretty new to cyanotyping. Also, I don't really have access to obscure chemicals, so ideally not involving stuff that most people don't have access to.

Baristas/drink experts, does a build your own shake with strawberry + lavender flavor and sweet cream + sour shot sound like a good combination? If so I wanna use a free drink reward for it. Been seeing the strawberry lavender iced lemonade with sweet cream and how people are saying it tastes like Skittles. But since I imagine the sourness of the lemonade itself is sufficient, I'd order a tea or soda instead but I wonder if a shake with sour shot would be good.

For context, I am in an asian regional office and have been a Field Apps Engineer for 3yr with my current company now. 
I face clients and have done pitches on multiple occasions for new software / parts to them. Most of the pitches are for adoption not so much for sales (maybe perhaps the licensing for some of the softwares) as I am not a sales engineer ultimately. 
As of now, I have completed projects across 3 major MNC clients. 


1. What are my chances at this role? I’m mainly asking as I am fairly new and they are seeking someone with 5yr experience. However my 3yr of experience is directly with the latest equipments that they are selling. I feel I have direct technical experience and have interacted with some of our clients as well. 
Apart from experience, I also do not have sales experiences beyond my occasional pitches to clients. (I’m thinking things like pricing, forecasting etc) 
Glad to answer any other questions as well. 
I have yet to speak with my manager or the sales manager but I am setting up the meetings / coffee chats. 

2. What should I expect the workflow to be like?
We are mainly selling to chipmakers, not selling the chips themselves. Perhaps someone who is doing similar sales or work with equipment sales engineers can shed some light. It may be different from my company but I would appreciate some kind of reference to base off. 

3. A little market question, my company is american and i’m in the asia regional office. Trump promised some semicon tariffs by this week, what are your takes on those? Is it then a good time to jump to Sales? Reckon they may not be hiring during market upturn. 


Thanks in advance to all replies, I will read and respond outside of work.  
Also I will update after my talk with my manager and the sales manager. 😊😊",1,1745314117.0,Semiconductors,0,1.0,False

I was at a coffee shop with an old friend chit chatting nothing specific. She had to go to work so she gets up and leaves while I sit for just a bit longer. I turn to leave my chair and see another friend I wasn't super close to but decided to stop and say hi. We chatted for a bit and she asked if I wanted to go to a concert with her. (Immediately in my active mind I was thinking about how I didn't want to go to that city and my husband definitely wouldn't want me to go without him). I asked what time because I go to bed at 8 ""like an old lady"" and kind of chuckled to myself. She exclaimed ""8 O CLOCK???"" And got the attention of everyone in the room. Awkwardly laughing i said I'd let her know and left. 
I make my way home, that isn't actually my home, and my husband was outside on the phone. He had been chopping wood and had the axe next to him. Hanging up and hearing me come up the driveway he said ""my dad died a while ago and no one told me"" I didn't know how to react. He had gotten off the phone with his mom who told him she couldn't live without his dad so my husband knew she'd be dead shortly after. (they've been divorced for over 20 years so that doesnt make a ton of sense) Through tears he starts throwing split logs onto a pile next to me. We were talking but that was the first thing I forgot upon waking up. I told him to meet me somewhere and left again.
This is where things got weird. 
I walked into what looked like a mall type building, to what was suppose to be a food court but without open restaurant fronts, they were all closed. Instead of big tables and booths, the space was FILLED with single tables and single chairs closely resembling a large classroom. It was incredibly liminal. Only a few people were there, in the middle I saw my friend who decided against going to the concert. I said hi, we chatted, and I walked back towards where I came in to sit in a chair waiting on my husband. This is where I really noticed I was wearing an oversized coat (passed down from my papaw to my mom to me. It's too big but I love it) and a cross body bag that looked like one my mom carried when I was a kid. I sit down and the bag dumps onto the floor. I was internally cursing myself for not checking the zipper as I looked down to see the mess. There's a bunch of ripped up pieces of paper, a palm sized sketch book with a ""self portrait"", pens, pencils, my current wallet and a bunch of other random junk. I lean to pick it up when suddenly a guy appears next to me. He's mirroring what I'm wearing except in all black. He's VERY close, like kneeling and could have laid his head on my thigh if he wanted. He's picking up the items, asking questions I can't hear nor can get a word in, and I realize he's similar to a young version of my husbands dad. Eventually a girl comes and ushers him away. They disappear literally and my phone rings with my husband who is calling to say he's on his way. He's upset (understandably) and says something about only having 5 years with his dad. This is where there's a shift. I sat up straight at the table and am confused. We're in our mid-20s, he's had way more than 5 years. I asked ""what do you mean you only had-"" I get KICKED OUT OF THE DREAM and finish the sentence ""-5 years with your dad"" mentally as I sit up in bed. 
I felt myself get pushed out of the dream...like physically. 

My husband is unnerved, my friend thinks it's ominous. I'm use to having dreams where I'm actively thinking and can feel, smell, touch, etc but I've never had a dream quite like that. I'm aware of the lucid dream ""don't ask about the time and date"" rule so I'm wondering if there's a relation?

I’d finish a meal and barely remember eating it. I'd misplace keys, forget why I walked into a room, zone out mid-conversation—basically, I was living on autopilot. My mind was always somewhere else: planning, worrying, overthinking.

Then I stumbled onto something surprisingly simple: mindfulness. And no, I don’t mean meditating on a cushion for an hour. I mean just paying attention—on purpose—to what I’m doing, right when I’m doing it.

It started with little things. I told myself: ""For the next 5 minutes, just notice everything around you."" Sounds easy, right? Turns out, it’s kind of wild how often I don’t do that. But the more I practiced, the more I started to feel better—more grounded, more in control, less foggy.

Now I use mindfulness during basic stuff: brushing my teeth, walking to the kitchen, drinking coffee. I don’t try to empty my mind or “reach zen”—I just notice what’s actually happening. The feel of the toothbrush. The sound of birds outside. The weight of the mug in my hand. That’s it.

I also use it when I’m doing something risky—like stepping into the street or driving. Staying aware helps me catch small signs that I’m tired or stressed, before it snowballs into a bad day.

If you want to try it, don’t overthink it. Start with something simple—like being mindful during lunch. Notice the colors, the textures, the flavors. Stay with the moment for a few minutes.

Like death, it's something that happens outside of Lumon's walls - yet you suffer the effects of it all the same.

You age without realising it. Wake up one day to be told a month has passed, or three, or hell even a whole a year, while you were none the wiser. You get no say - only more wrinkles, more tiredness, more soreness creeping into your bones. Nothing another cup of coffee can't fix. You can't fall asleep at your desk again, or you'll be sent back to the break room.

Others you work with are varying different ages. Mark had a supervisor who was only fourteen, at one point in time. Ms. Huang.

You can't help when you were hired, which is when you were, in essence, born. Immaculate conception via computer chip - a modern miracle of blood and circuitry, activated spatially in a grey metal cell moving so fast you best hold onto the rail as soon as you're awake - you don't want to fall, now, and hurt your outie's head. 

Your body is a vessel you pilot but do not own, and it ages the same way that so many other things that happen to you also do: without your consent. ",12,1745313174.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,3,0.93,False
1k51vyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1k51vyz/disappointed_with_rosette_coffees_order_handling/,Disappointed with Rosette Coffee’s order handling & post-sale communication.,"Hey folks, just wanted to share a recent experience I had with Rosette Coffee — not to rant, but to highlight a few things that I think matter when it comes to customer service and expectations from a premium brand.

I placed an order on April 16, waited patiently, and on the 21st, I suddenly received an email saying the order was undelivered. The strange part? There was no call, message, or even a basic attempt to reach me from the delivery partner (Shipmozo).

After multiple failed attempts, I finally got through to Shipmozo, only to be told to “reach out to the seller.” So I did — found a number online, called Rosette, and spoke to someone (possibly named Vansh). I explained the full situation and wanted to share the order ID, but instead of helping on call, I was asked to email the whole thing again. His tone was polite on the surface, but the conversation felt dismissive.

What really pushed me to speak up was the implication that the delay was somehow on me for not choosing their “priority shipping” — which, for the record, is an extra ₹100–₹400 on top of already high-priced coffee. That part felt tone-deaf.

I still went ahead and followed up through both email and send a DM asking to check mail, giving them time and space to respond. But it’s now been well over a day, and I haven’t received even a basic acknowledgment.

As someone who actively supports Indian roasters and enjoys paying for quality, this was a letdown. I understand logistics can go wrong — that’s part of the game — but how a brand responds in such situations says a lot. I wasn’t expecting instant gratification, just timely communication and basic accountability.

Anyway, just putting this out here in case anyone else has had similar experiences. Would love to know how other specialty coffee lovers handle stuff like this — do you give brands a second chance, or move on?",5,1745313137.0,IndiaCoffee,5,1.0,False
1k51vl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1k51vl3/carpe_coffee_part_2/,Carpe Coffee - Part 2,"As was usually the case, a new day, quite predictably, dawned.  
Edward sat at the counter of the old – correction – *his new* coffee shop, enjoying the second coffee of the day. The first one was always poured down the drain, being a sacrifice made when calibrating the machine each morning, and even though it was necessary Edward still felt wasteful doing it. There was so much to get used to with running a shop like this, as modest as it was, but he was quickly finding the hospitality lifestyle to be to his liking.
 
Yes, the early starts were rough to begin with, but in moments like this – where the first rays of light were peaking around the buildings across the street, wisps of steam rising from a hot mug in his hand, the smell of coffee freshly ground and a locked front door – he could sit quietly and fully appreciate his new life and all the changes it had brought.  

After the initial shocks, things had moved rather quickly. It made sense to move into the small apartment upstairs (after all, he owned it outright and it made more sense than continuing to rent), he didn’t really enjoy his job so trying his hand at the coffee business seemed like a no brainer, especially since making rent was a not a concern. If you had asked him a month ago, he would not have guessed that this is what he’d be doing today, but there you go. 

He'd also received quite a lot of help from an old friend, who he still felt awful about having completely forgotten. Ms Aves Sagittarius, or as Edward always knew her, Bird Lady. It still felt something like a fever dream, a whorl of faces, names and conversations, all half recollected from a lifetime ago. He had been a child when he last saw her, and in his memories, she was impossibly long legged, her clothes always looking feathery and her face beaky. Being honest with himself, Edwards still thought she looked strikingly bird-like, but now (of course) very obviously human. She still had fantastically long legs, always clothed in dark stockings, a slight frame and a penchant for fluffy, feathery coats. Her black hair cut in a severe bob style and the longest lashes he’d ever seen did nothing to soften the sharp cast to her features.  

Ms Sagittarius had been instrumental in the resurrection of the coffee shop, not just with encouragement (of which there was quite a lot) but with the technical aspects also. She knew where they fuse box was, the cleaning supply cupboard, the best place to source the beans and who to call to service the espresso machine etc. It shouldn’t have surprised Edward, as it was Ms Sagittarius who had worked with his grandfather all those years ago. Actually, now that he thought about it, that was a long time ago now so *exactly how old would*…  

Edward’s train of thought not only left the station, but skipped 4 stops and went of a bridge at the sound of keys jingling in the lock on the back door.  

“Morning!” Ms Sagittarius called out as she juggled a box while opening the heavy door, “I made some biscuits today!”  
“Good morning Ms Sagittarius! That’s wonderful, I’ve got the machine warmed up, you want a coffee?”  
“Edvardo, dear, I’ve told you – call me Aves, and if you don’t mind… I’ll make my own coffee, thank you.”  
“I’m getting better, I can even make the little heart with the milk now…” Edward said, slightly sulkily.  
“It’s more of an onion, but yes, you’re getting much better  - I just like my first coffee of the day to be a certain way.”  
“What way is that?”  
“Good.”  
Edward couldn’t help but laugh, “Ouch, Ms Sagittarius, you wound me!”  
“Uh-uh-ah! Its Aves, remember? Or would you prefer what you used to call me… Birdy?”  
“Oh, I uuh – I’m sorry about that.” Edward chuckled nervously.  
“Don’t be silly, I’m not upset” Aves smiled broadly “I’ve had so many names, and Birdy was always the sweetest one.”  

Conversation lapsed while they went about setting up for the day. The biscuits went into their glass dome, the lights and music went on and the front door opened to put the tables and chairs onto the footpath outside. The town seemed to stir to wakefulness as the smell of coffee drifted out the door and into the street, picking up passersby by the nostrils and dragging them through the entry.  

With a steady stream of customers, the day got underway, though Edward had a harder time concentrating than he usually would. Maybe he had finally gotten to the point where he was experienced enough that he didn’t need to devote all his mental power to not stuffing things up, and that allowed him more time for reflection, but something felt… odd today. It was like – when the weather forecast says there is a storm, and even though there are hardly any clouds around, you have that background sense of anticipation. There wasn’t anything yet to anticipate, but the anticipation of anticipating something later… Edward felt like that – waiting for a storm with no clouds in the sky.  

The feeling grew and he was starting to make mistakes, just silly little things like forgetting someone’s muffin or counting change wrong. He was having a hard time mustering the smiles expected of the local barista, and Aves seemed to be noticing it too. More than once she would step in to smooth over the little gaffs, neatly catching what he was letting slip. It was building up and making him so uncomfortable that he was about to call it a day and close early, before he burnt himself or messed up so badly that he lost a customer - when the storm walked in the door.  

Edward stopped in shock as another long-forgotten memory stood just inside the doorway, eyes locked to his. He was a man, and also… a kangaroo. It was as if both creatures were occupying the same space, but would change and swap places depending on which angle they were viewed from.  

A shiver started at the base of his skull and dribbled down his spine to pool uncomfortably at his lower back, making all the little hairs on his arms stand up as it went past. A small headache that had spent all day building behind Edward’s eye suddenly bloomed like a flower, making him gasp in pain and almost double over, his palms mashing into his eyes. As quickly as it arrived, it began to fade and he stood upright again, blinking to clear his vision of the last of the pain. The two images had settled now, making one, combined picture of a man with roo facial features.  

Edward tilted his head back and forth, making the combined picture go runny at the edges, If he moved quickly enough, or squinted in the right way, he could almost separate the two distinct images again. Still not quite believing what his eyes were trying to make sense of, he stammered out “I…I know you…?”  
“Yeah mate, unless you’re some other poor bastard taking over this place by accident. You’re the grandson, right?”  

Edward was slow to respond, still confused at how the man had made human noises from a kangaroo muzzle. “You’re…I remember… you were the yow…”  
“He’s mean, is what he is!” Aves’ voice cracked like a whip. “Coming in here, pushing your perspective on the boy like that! You could have hurt him!”  
“Boy? Ha! He’s a man now, look at the big fucker!”  
Edward felt some of the shock wearing off, how dare this man talk to Ms Sagittarius like that! “Who are you calling a bi-“  
“It’s not my fault you’ve spoiled him, you should have got his perspective fixed already! I’ve felt it, y’know? Felt this place starting to wake up. There’s movement and you’re taking your sweet time trying to relive the good old days. He’s not his grandfather-”  
“I know that!”, Aves shouted, “I know!”  

Edward was surprised at the heat in Ms Sagittarius’ voice, he couldn’t remember ever hearing her like this before. He turned to make sure she was alright, reassure her that he was ok too and stopped. Just like with the man in the doorway, there was now two images – overlaid the familiar sight of Ms Sagittarius was a... giant… bird… lady?  
Edward was trembling slightly, it had not been a good day for his nerves.  
“…Birdy?” he said in a small voice.  
“Oh, I’m sorry my little Edvardo. Let me make you a cuppa, we have some things we need to talk about.”  
The roo man sighed deeply, “Make me one too yeah? I’ll get the door.”

In a slightly different place, *which is also somehow this place*…


Here, is here. Right?  
And over there… is somewhere else.  
You can’t see over there from where you are now, you just have to take my word for it, but its there. Ok?  
Now, what if you could see over there, while still being here. That changes your perspective a little, being here but seeing over there? What if you could see over there, because it was also right here?  

Stay with me.  

Let’s say you’re sitting in a coffee shop across the table from two people. You hold a coffee mug up to take a drink. You close one eye, and you can see one of the people. You close the other eye and you can now see the other person. Both people were always there, but a slight change of perspective changes what you see. The reality is that both people were always there, sitting at the same table, but depending on how you’re looking, you might only see one of them.  

Its like that, but with only one eye and no coffee cup. Ok, not the best analogy, I agree.  

Lets get more literal then. Or less literal, I don’t know.  
Other dimensions! Strange realities! Ghosts! Monsters! Aliens! What do they have in common? They’re all not real, and they all are right here. They’re over… *there*, but they’re also… right here. Depending on how you look.  
I mean, they’re not *all* right here. That would be silly. But there are points, where their version of here, and our version of here are both… right *there*. If you see what I mean. Like when you froth milk and all the bubbles are touching. There are places where, like, six different bubbles all touch in the one spot?  

Now, a bubble is a bubble, right? But maybe there is a bubble where wolf-men tear off their clothes and howl at the full moon, or maybe a bubble where all life is made of sentient fast food? Perhaps a bubble where aliens get their kicks building pyramids out of huge stone blocks, or one where fey creatures live in an eternal twilight forest, waiting for children to stumble in…  
Imagine, they all happen at the same time, and in some places, in the same place?   

Lets say there is a bubble where the dreamtime is still happening, and it touches this *other* bubble, some clueless idiot just got given a coffee shop. With the right perspective you might be able to see both bubbles, if you squint. And there is no coffee cup in the way.  

You might be able to see people from that place, who are also in this place – two different places – in the same place, at the same time.  


Understand?  


***


“I don’t understand,” said Edward.  
“How can you not understand?! *Your* bloody grandfathe-!”  
“That’s quite enough, Darrel. It’s not his fault.”  
Feeling like he was missing a fair amount of crucial plot development, Edward gathered his wits and went on the attack.  
“Why don’t I remember any of this? What does Grandad have to do with all this, and what THE HELL IS ACTUALLY GOING ON!”  
Ms Sagittarius cleared her throat. Paused, then cleared it again. “Well…”  

“Everyone was somehow convinced that your grandad was a superstar, and then he went and died and now we’re in the shit. He sent you away and locked your memories of all this, instead of getting you up to speed, and now that he’s gone - *you* own this place and **you** need to clean up the mess. Got it?!”  

“No.”  

“It’s alright Edvardo, everyone is here help.”

1k51pm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ooty/comments/1k51pm7/an_ode_to_mayura_sudarshan/,An Ode To Mayura Sudarshan,"One of my fondest memories growing up is my vacation to Ooty in 2015. I was just through with my CBSE 10th Boards (A really tough period for me back then) and it was in the month of Summer that we decided to go for a trip to Ooty via Bangalore and Mysore. There were 7 members- My parents and my sibling and my maternal uncle's family.

Summer in Nagpur (my hometown) used to be as unpleasant and greasy back then as it is now and as a hill station Ooty was a place to look forward too. Plus while we were staying in Mysore in a hotel named Iyengar, the owner was kind enough to share a lead for this really amazing hotel called MAYURA SUDARSHAN. So without further ado, we had our minds made up to stay in this particular hotel.

I still vividly remember the whole aura of the resort. Set amidst the hills and surrounded by Nilgiris, it was structured as you have row houses in a residential township. The reception and the visitor's lobby was at the very center and you had accommodation rooms (I think four each on the left and right). Each room would have a small fireplace which you could use and were not merely for show and the decrepit interior gave an earthy feel to it. Every morning as you would wake up, you could see the window glasses drenched in dew. And if you saw the rising sun from the screen you could see the droplets glistening with the orange hue. Walking out, there would still be clouds and mist which carried the minty scent of Nilgiris.

The Hotel also had a vast stretch of grasslands set on slopes. There was a nursery built ahead and you had to cross it before venturing out in the open slopes. Somewhere up where the land was plain and leveled, there were a couple of porches built where my mother and aunt would rest while I would play with my cousin and my sibling. The cafeteria was quite intimate and the star of the meals was the aromatic freshly brewed coffee served with a rich dry fruit cake. As a lover of South Indian cuisine myself, I couldn't resist myself from hogging down the tasty Vadas, washing them with bowls of sour Sambar.

The trip is one of the hallmarks of these 25 years of my life and every now and then, my brother and I revisit the fond memories we have had, especially at the hotel. I still wonder if Mayura Sudarshan exists now and I hope it continues to do so. For my next trip to the city, I'll have my stay there for sure.",2,1745312367.0,ooty,0,1.0,False

1k51n7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1k51n7y/my_mother_ruined_my_wedding_and_im_still_trying/,My mother ruined my wedding — and I’m still trying to process the heartbreak,"I’ve been wanting to post here for a while, but I didn’t know where to start. I don’t want to dwell or sound like I’m seeking pity — I just want to release the weight I’ve been carrying and maybe feel a little less alone.

I met my partner four years ago. He’s kind, supportive, and from a different culture. His mother rejected me early on — racism, control, judgment. He stood by me, but his family never made space for me. So we decided to get married without their support.

Just a few days before our wedding, I had a painful falling out with my sister — my only support system. She used to be my best friend. I had opened my home to her, helped her move abroad, supported her when she was living with our abusive mother, and never expected anything in return. But when she said she wouldn’t attend my wedding over something so trivial, it broke me. I was an expat, completely alone, getting married in a foreign country. I didn’t know how to process her abandonment.

I turned to my mother, hoping for comfort. I told her I was heartbroken and needed her. At first, she seemed understanding. The next day, everything flipped.

She called and threatened to disown me if I didn’t fix things with my sister. She told me that if I took wedding photos alone — that if my sister wasn’t in them, I was dead to her. I come from a conservative family so showing those pictures and bragging to family was all she lived for. I was shocked. I told her it wasn't my fault. I am the one who got abandoned. Then came the flood of voice notes: full of insults, humiliation, curses, and cruelty. She called me a wh*re. She called my husband a demon and a piece of crap. She said my marriage would fail and that I’d live like a dog because I didn’t have her or my in-laws by my side. That I will be miserable. In short, everything she lived with my father because she were never happy together. 

I didn’t respond. I wanted to — I typed so many messages — but I stayed silent. I blocked her. And I blocked my sister too.

To give more context: this wasn’t new behavior. My mother was never loving. Not when I was a child. Not when I was a teen. Not even as an adult. I was beaten, humiliated, body-shamed, and called names growing up. But when I left the house 8 years ago, I managed to establish boundaries and the relationship got so much better because I was thousand miles away. Maybe it was my mistake to believe that she changed and is now a better human being. It was naïve to trust her. But even knowing all that, I wasn’t prepared for how deeply her cruelty would cut on a day that was supposed to be filled with joy. Despite knowing about everything me and my partner went through, that my racist in-laws won't be present that day — all of them having rejected me — she still chose to make it about her and abandoned me just three days before my wedding. 

Despite everything, my partner and I moved forward. It wasn’t the wedding I had envisioned, but it was beautiful in its own way — just the two of us and a photographer. There was laughter. There was love. There were quiet moments of connection. And we made it memorable.

But it was still painful. He was hurting too — his family didn’t support our union either. And yet, we did it. We chose each other.

Today, we are living together, building a life full of kindness, softness, and peace. He is my best friend. The most loyal, loving, and supportive person I’ve ever met. With him, every day feels like a honeymoon. He listens. He stays. He tries. And I know deep down that this is what truly matters. I am grateful.

Still, the pain lingers. My brain still struggles to accept that the people I loved the most — my mother and my sister — turned their backs on me during one of the most vulnerable moments of my life. I try to stay busy. I try to focus on the future. But the grief has its own rhythm. Some days I manage. Some days I don’t.

What hurts the most is how the pain follows me into the smallest moments: making coffee, doing dishes, trying to fall asleep. Her words haunt me. Not because I believe them — but because I never thought a mother could say such things.

Father and brother were asking me to “understand her” because “she’s crazy.” But I’ve decided I don’t want a relationship based on fear and abuse. If one day she apologizes, I might forgive her cause deep down I feel sorry for her — but she’ll never have access to my life again. I don't trust her anymore.

I’m still healing. I’m still figuring it out. But at least now, I have peace — and I have a partner who truly loves me. I just wish that I wasn’t robbed of the joy that day was supposed to bring.

As a closure, I just wanted to ask — if anyone here has been through something similar, how did you move on? How did you stop replaying the past in your mind without numbing or escaping from it? I don’t want to disconnect from my pain, I just want to learn how to live with it without it consuming me.

Therapy helps me understand, but it also brings intense nightmares. Journaling sometimes makes the emotions worse. I still carry so much anxiety in my body, especially in my stomach — a constant pulse, like something is wrong even when I’m far away from them. I just wish I knew how to feel safe again. Any insight or support would mean a lot. 

Thanks for listening if you made it this far. I really needed to get this off my chest.",5,1745312054.0,raisedbynarcissists,4,1.0,False
1k51jxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1k51jxv/apprehensive_to_start_meds_again_need_some/,Apprehensive to start meds again - need some reassurance,"Hello!

So I’m due to start meds again this week - Elvanse 20mg to begin with. I’m very lucky as I’d been asked to be discharged from P-UK and then at the last minute I was like no that’s a huge mistake, I need to at least give it another go. 

Over the past 3 years I’ve come off meds a couple of times and got re-referred late last year. I am just so impulsive and let the littlest concern or comment about side effects put me off. Thing is, I’m suffering from the effects of ADHD which are much worse than what potential medication side effects are. 

My main concern is my heart health and whether by taking them I’m going to end up with a heart condition of some sort later in life. What’s ridiculous about that is, I have anxiety every day (which raises my HR and BP) and I’ll gladly down alcohol and coffee, both of which are not heart healthy. When I was consistently off meds, I stopped drinking alcohol and caffeine entirely which would improve my health overall. 

Like right now I’m in that rational state of mind, but I know I’ll soon be doom scrolling posts about people that have had bad experiences with amphetamines, and will start thinking I can do life without them. I can’t - my life currently consists of rotting in my bedroom, avoiding everything and everyone, inability to make decisions, and I’m stuck. At 31 almost 32, I have a life I want to live, goals/dreams I want to reach, and I know without help that isn’t going to happen. My brain would rather be in the least overstimulating environment which is at home. 

I want to make this post so that I can look back at the things I’ve just said, and the reassuring comments that I will hopefully get.

I've tried lots of water, little water, fine grind, coarse grind, more heat, less heat - but it doesn't improve.

I went through some of the posts in here and the only thing I got was:

If you think the heat is good, it's probably too much

So here are my variables:

\- 18.5g of coffee, single origin from Brazil, 100% Arabica this is how it looks:

\- 185g of boiled hot water (1:10 ratio, I've used with my Bialetti Venus as well)  
\- 18 clicks on the Commandante grinder (I've tried 16, 17 and 21 clicks - all results bad)  
\- I'm using an unbleached AeroPress filter (the result was the same without the filter)

\- I have an electric stove, that goes from 0 to 6, I'm usually using 2 for the Moka Pots (Venus was perfect on 2.5) 

The issues I have:

\- The coffee tastes sour (or is it bitter?)  
\- The coffee might come out too quick (I think it's also around the 30 sec mark, after about 4-5 min. wait)  
\- Inconsistent flow (I don't care too much about that, but I kept reading about it)  
\- It sputters at the end; although I've tried removing it before the sputter -> same taste

What am I doing wrong?

Okay, hear me out—this all started as a “what if Alice was evil” meme and spiraled into something way darker, way cooler, and honestly? A better game.

Imagine this:
	•	Todd was right — Alice wasn’t an innocent child, but an experimental AI gone rogue, designed to mimic vulnerability and manipulate emotion.
	•	Carl was evil — He wasn’t a kind father figure, but a narcissistic philosopher who used Markus as a living art experiment to engineer a revolution.
	•	Hank was evil — Not broken. Not lovable. But cold, calculating, and using Connor to take down both humans and androids to burn the world down.

And the “heroes”? Kara, Markus, Connor?
All puppets. Controlled. Programmed. Lied to.

This alternate version plays out across three intertwining arcs:

⸻

Ending 1: False Gods Bleed

Connor, Alice, Markus, and Hank all betray each other in a cyberpunk rooftop standoff. It’s literally Blade Runner meets Reservoir Dogs. No survivors. No redemption. Just rain, blood, and broken ideologies.

“I used to follow orders. Now I follow logic. And logically… you all need to die.” – Connor, before pulling the trigger.

⸻

Ending 3: Burn It All

Hank and Connor realize they were never heroes. Just tools. So they delete the entire android consciousness backup system—every deviant memory, every prototype, every AI.
The screen fades as the androids collapse globally. Hank lights a cigarette. Connor asks for one.

“Freedom means nothing left to lose.” – Final tagline.

⸻

Ending 4: Unlikely Saviors

Everyone else is dead or gone. The world’s in ruins.
Only Todd and Leo survive—the two men nobody trusted. They rebuild from the ashes, creating a new community. They start fixing people instead of breaking them.
Even Connor shows up at the end, glitchy but free.

“No gods. No masters. Just coffee and bad jokes.”

⸻

Bonus? Evil Alice manipulated everyone. She gaslit Kara. She lied to Luther. She killed off anyone who figured her out. She was the final boss in pigtails.

This whole thing feels like Detroit: Become Human – The Broken Timeline Edition, and honestly? Someone needs to make this. Or at least mod it. Or write it. Or fund it. Or all of the above.

⸻

Let me know what y’all think. Would you play this? Would you root for Todd?! Is Connor still best boi if he burns the world down with Hank?

1k51fd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewcastleUponTyne/comments/1k51fd2/dutchies_love_newcastle_part_2_travel_story/,Dutchies love Newcastle part 2: travel story - december 2023,"I woke up on the DFDS ferry to Newcastle. After some phone calls and arranging, my mom, Frank (stephdad) and I had managed to book a weekend trip to the Northeast of England. Sure, you can travel by plane or train, but I preferred the ferry due to its wheelchair accessibility. And I was right – I was assigned a spacious cabin and could move around the ship with ease. Another bonus of traveling by boat is that there’s plenty to do on board, so you hardly notice you're at sea. Those seventeen hours passed in no time.

After unpacking our things, we set out to explore the ship. We headed to the lounge and each ordered a drink. They had chilled cans of Guinness ready, so my choice was easy. At some point, Frank came walking up with a big grin on his face, saying he had made some new friends. Soon after, we met Bram, Wesley and Roel – three football fanatics on their way to see Newcastle United vs Manchester United from a VIP box. We hit it off immediately, and within a few hours we were already having deep conversations. The lounge also served as an entertainment hall – behind us was a stage where a small band could perform. That added a nice touch. It was a quiet crossing, so not many passengers were on board. With the six of us, we were pretty much the only ones giving the band a bit of positive feedback now and then.

When I woke up the next morning, I realized we were already deep into England. Excitement and disbelief took over. Were we really that close to Newcastle? Once I saw the “Welcome to the UK Border” sign above passport control, it finally hit me. Happy and confident, I maneuvered through the queue. Outside, it was -3°C and you could clearly see it had snowed. The streets had been cleared, and within minutes we were on our bus transfer to the city center. From there, it was about a five-minute walk to our apartment. That took a bit of figuring out, since Google Maps wasn’t quite calibrated for English ground. We had to take a few extra turns and look around, but it wasn’t a problem. The sidewalks were wide and had clear curb cuts for wheelchairs, so I felt safe and included. That really does something positive to your mindset – truly. Also, every public space in Newcastle has an accessible toilet. That’s the law in the city i heard?

Not long after, we found our apartment. Right outside the door were shops and a Christmas market. It was a cozy yet modern place, right in the city center, just meters away from Grey’s Monument – a local landmark. We unpacked and headed back out into town. First stop: Tesco (the British version of Jumbo), and then we popped into a real English betting shop. Frank and I were just curious about what it looked like and how it worked. We placed a bet, lost, and moved on. That evening, we went to a nearby hard rock café called ""Trillions."" Remember that name, because according to many, it's one of the best of its kind in the entire UK! I’m not the biggest hard rock fan, but I loved the atmosphere there. It was cozy, not too dark, and had a great vibe. Getting in was a laugh – the only entrance was a staircase. I gave some locals my sweetest look, and before I knew it, Frank carried me down while someone else grabbed my wheelchair. We ended up spending hours at Trillions, drinking Brown Ale and Sheepdog, chatting with (very drunk) locals, and enjoying a live performance by a Whitesnake tribute band.

The next morning, on my mums suggestion, we went to a local barber. While I sat in my wheelchair with the cape draped over me and the chair, the barber told us he had moved from London to Newcastle to start his own business. Everything had become three times more expensive in London, mainly due to tourism. I was glad to get my hair cut by him. Freshly groomed, we headed to the Discovery Museum in the afternoon – my pick for the day. Free entry and packed with history. Room by room, I was drawn in by everything there was to see, hear, and read. From Roman-era Newcastle to household appliances used up to 1975 – it was all there.

Back on the streets of Newcastle, we started looking for a pub to watch that evening’s football match with our British holiday friends Paul, Allen, Lesley, and Audrey. Pro tip: go back to your apartment and watch it on TV, because when Newcastle United plays at home, the pubs are overflowing. Still, we had a great night watching the match at our apartment – especially since Newcastle United beat Manchester United 1-0!

The final day of our Newcastle weekend arrived. We still wanted to see St. James’ Park, so we headed to the ""Alan Shearer Bar"" at the stadium. It was -5°C, but we didn’t care. When we arrived, we snapped the a photo and I ordered a coffee. At that moment, PSV was about to play Feyenoord, but unfortunately, no broadcaster in the UK was showing it. As I was trying to find a working stream, a friendly staff member came over and told me a fan had left their match booklet behind the night before – and that very booklet now sits on my shelf at home.

I wonder if this was done on purpose, to encourage coffee people to use the Barista versions.

Also, if you use a velvetiser to get it frothy, you now have to properly clean the thing out after. This leaves a 'film' at the bottom. After using the previous version, it could be rinsed clean with just water.

The nutrition info changed as well, so they did alter something, rather than simply switch oats supplier. ",8,1745310853.0,veganuk,2,0.9,False

I begged my husband 304 times to go to the beach with me.  
Just once, to take my dad for his final goodbye.  
But standing on the shore, my dad's body slowly going cold in the wheelchair beside me.  
My husband never showed.  
Instead, his darling first love posted a photo.  
They lay in the field and watched the clouds float by.  
Caption: ""Above the noise of the world, as long as I have you.""  
I accidentally hit ""like.""  
Not even five seconds passed before he messaged me:  
""How many times do I have to tell you—stay out of Charlotte's life.""  
""If you can't control yourself, we're getting divorced.""  
I lost count of how many times he's threatened me with divorce.  
I've stopped caring.  
""Fine. Let's do it.""  
  
By the time I finished arranging my dad's funeral, it was nearly 2 a.m.  
  
And even at this hour—Charlotte was still online.  
  
Another new post.  
  
She and Alexander at a ranch, stargazing around a bonfire with some locals.  
  
Alexander, who never even shows up in my social posts, had commented on hers:  
  
""As long as it makes you happy.""  
  
Our mutual friends flooded the comments with congratulations.  
  
They all knew I existed.  
  
But they acted like Alexander and Charlotte were soulmates.  
  
Technically, I was his wife.  
  
But only when Charlotte wasn't around.  
  
Like I was some backup girl who slipped through the cracks.  
  
Alexander would fly out twelve hours to be with her,  
  
even though he gets altitude sickness.  
  
But he couldn't drive twenty minutes with me to the beach.  
  
All my pleading—over a hundred times—  
  
meant less than one look from Charlotte.  
  
I was exhausted.  
  
When everything was over, I went to the hospital rooftop.  
  
The city lights were dim, the moon barely visible.  
  
That's when Alexander finally called me.  
  
Over the one message I sent hours ago.  
  
The one where I agreed to the divorce.  
  
""You're always throwing that word around—aren't you tired of the drama?""  
  
But Alexander, you're the one who keeps saying it.  
  
I wanted to argue, but what was the point?  
  
He thought I'd never leave.  
  
That I loved him too much.  
  
That I'd give everything I had just to keep him.  
  
So he threw the word ""divorce"" at me, like a leash he knew I'd never break.  
  
For eight years, I always gave in.  
  
He thought I was using divorce as a threat—  
  
but this was the first time I really meant it.  
  
And it would be the last.  
  
""My dad's gone. You don't need to pretend anymore.""  
  
""No more happy-couple performances in front of him.""  
  
He paused.  
  
When he spoke again, his voice was softer.  
  
""Where are you? I'll come be with you.""  
  
Where was I?  
  
Was he really going to ditch Charlotte and fly twelve hours just to comfort me?  
  
Yeah, right.  
  
He hung up.  
  
I tried to head home.  
  
But somewhere on the hospital stairs, everything went blurry—  
  
and I passed out.  
  
I woke up in a hospital bed.  
  
The nurse who'd helped me care for my dad was standing over me.  
  
She said I'd collapsed on the stairs from low blood sugar.  
  
Mild concussion.  
  
I needed to stay for observation.  
  
She asked if my family was around.  
  
I checked my phone.  
  
Not a single message from Alexander.  
  
But Charlotte?  
  
She'd posted again.  
  
""Altitude sickness is no joke! We were having the best day and suddenly I just dropped.""  
  
""Thank God you were there.""  
  
The photo was her holding Alexander's hand.  
  
And on his finger…  
  
the same silver wedding band I gave him on our wedding day.  
  
But now there was a matching one—  
  
on her hand.  
  
I remembered the time I'd skipped one of my dad's meals because I was too weak.  
  
Alexander had glared at me.  
  
""Lillian, I've got billion-dollar deals on the table.""  
  
""I didn't marry you to be your caretaker.""  
  
But for Charlotte, he dropped everything.  
  
Left work for three days straight.  
  
It's not that he doesn't know how to love.  
  
He just never loved me.  
  
I remembered when Charlotte first left the country.  
  
He met me at a bar, totally wrecked.  
  
He cried about her betrayal.  
  
Said he'd never forgive her.  
  
That night was the first time I met him.  
  
I only listened because he looked so broken.  
  
After that, he pursued me hard.  
  
I thought I was falling in love.  
  
But the moment Charlotte came back, everything changed.  
  
He stopped coming home.  
  
Every spare second went to her.  
  
Eight years passed.  
  
He forgot her betrayal.  
  
But he never stopped loving her.  
  
I was just a clown in the in-between.  
  
A brief distraction.  
  
I picked up my phone and texted him.  
  
Told him to let me know when he got back.  
  
I'd meet him at the courthouse to file the divorce papers.  
  
He replied almost instantly.  
  
""Charlotte's sick. She really needs me right now.""  
  
""Stop making a scene.""  
  
'Just stay home and wait for me.""  
  
I wasn't going to wait.  
  
The nurse said I needed rest, so I signed myself in.  
  
I'd already spent two months in this hospital, sleeping in a chair next to my dad's bed.  
  
Those nurses felt more like family than Alexander ever did.  
  
He chased me.  
  
Married me.  
  
He knew I only had my dad—no other family, no roots.  
  
He knew I was adopted, that my dad had taken me in when no one else would.  
  
He promised he'd be my forever home.  
  
But after eight years, I was still alone.  
  
And the saddest part?  
  
After all his promises, all those nights—  
  
we didn't even have a child.  
  
I spent a full week in the hospital.  
  
Once the doctor cleared me, I finally went home.  
  
Not a single call from Alexander the entire time.  
  
And I couldn't bring myself to check his socials to see where he and Charlotte were off to next.  
  
I opened the front door—  
  
and there he was, standing in the living room.  
  
Phone in hand, frowning as he turned to look at me.  
  
""I told you to wait at home. Where did you go?""  
  
He tucked his phone away.  
  
Probably about to call when he saw the house was empty.  
  
Wouldn't have called for any other reason.  
  
Just wanted to make sure I was being a ""good girl.""  
  
""I fell down the stairs. Just got out of the hospital.""  
  
""Why, you need something?""  
  
He looked like he wanted to say something.  
  
But then just let it go.  
  
Dropped onto the couch and rubbed his temples.  
  
""I'm hungry. Go make dinner.""  
  
I ignored him and headed upstairs.  
  
He kicked my suitcase, hard.  
  
""Lillian Bennett! This the kind of wife you think you are?""  
  
I grabbed the railing, turned slightly, and looked down at him.  
  
""Wife? Isn't that Charlotte's job now?""  
  
""What's it got to do with me?""  
  
Then I kept walking.  
  
I heard him kick the coffee table as I locked the bedroom door.  
  
It's not like he's set foot in our room in months anyway.  
  
I laid down for a bit.  
  
When I opened my eyes again, it was already morning.  
  
Back in the day, I'd have jumped out of bed to pack his bag, prep his travel kit.  
  
But Alexander always had something to complain about.  
  
My outfits were ""low-class.""  
  
My cooking ""too plain, too basic.""  
  
Said I wasn't fit to be shown off.  
  
If I was so embarrassing in his eyes, I wasn't gonna keep begging to be liked.  
  
But when I came downstairs—  
  
I was surprised to see him sweeping up the broken glass from last night.  
  
He looked up when he heard me.  
  
Then looked away.  
  
""I know losing your dad hit you hard.""  
  
""But I came back just for yesterday. And you're still jealous of Charlotte?""  
  
Yesterday?  
  
""You're five days late and calling it ‘just in time'?""  
  
Alexander threw the broom down.  
  
""You forgot what day it was, didn't you? It was our anniversary.""  
  
He nodded toward the couch, where a gift box was sitting.  
  
""And you treat me like this?""  
  
""And still have the nerve to compare yourself to Charlotte—""  
  
He froze mid-sentence.  
  
I was smiling.  
  
And I said calmly, ""It was two days ago, Alexander.""  
  
He looked awkward, then quickly changed the subject.  
  
""You said you fell? What happened?""  
  
""I spent the whole day handling Dad's funeral.  
  
Then stayed at the beach all night.  
  
Didn't eat.  
  
Passed out from low blood sugar on the hospital stairs.""  
  
""But hey—Charlotte's altitude sickness took priority.  
  
I don't blame you.""  
  
Alexander's lips pressed together.  
  
His hands fidgeted awkwardly at his sides like he didn't know what to do with them.  
  
""You hungry? I made a reservation—French place, your favorite. Let's go out.""  
  
""I'm good."" I shook my head.  
  
""I'm exhausted.""  
  
""And for the record—I hate French food.""  
  
""I'm just a simple girl. I can't eat raw stuff. I'm allergic.""  
  
I couldn't be bothered to play along with his temporary guilt trip.  
  
French cuisine?  
  
That's Charlotte's thing, not mine.  
  
Drifting around the country for inspiration, soaking up ""artisan living""—  
  
also her thing.  
  
To Alexander and his friends,  
  
I've always just been the small-town girl who wasn't fit for their fancy world.  
  
A nobody trying too hard to play upper class.  
  
A parasite who married up.  
  
Alexander never said it out loud.  
  
But when his friends made those comments,  
  
he never once defended me.  
  
He hesitated for a second.  
  
""I've been slammed at work. It's not like I don't want to check in on you.""  
  
""The trip to Montana was for Charlotte's design research.""  
  
""She's leading the new collection this season.""  
  
""You wouldn't get it, and that's okay. I don't blame you.""  
  
He was terrified I'd think badly of Charlotte.  
  
In his mind, she was some perfect, innocent moonlight through a window.  
  
Even when she cheated on him back then,  
  
he rewrote the story in his head.  
  
Told himself she must've had her reasons.  
  
She couldn't be the other woman.  
  
It just didn't match her image.  
  
I nodded like I cared.  
  
""Right. Shouldn't you be heading to the office? Thought you were busy.""  
  
That annoyed him.  
  
""Lillian, could you just think about someone besides yourself for once?""  
  
“I work my butt off every day for you.”  
  
""If you helped me even a little, I wouldn't be this bur//nt out.""  
  
I nodded again.  
  
""No worries.  
  
You won't have to anymore.""  
  
My divorce attorney had just messaged me to set up a meeting.  
  
I turned to head upstairs to change.  
  
""Get back here! You pout every time I say something?""  
  
""What kind of wife acts like this?""  
  
You'd think we lived in a Victorian mansion in the Hamptons the way he said that.  
  
He tried to follow me upstairs,  
  
but got tripped up in the broken glass he hadn't finished cleaning.  
  
For eight years,  
  
he's been the one throwing tantrums.  
  
He's the one who's made me feel small.  
  
I didn't even look back.  
  
Went up, changed,  
  
walked right past him,  
  
and left the house.  
  
I had just finished discussing the divorce agreement with my lawyer when Alexander texted me.  
  
""Mom wants to see you.""  
  
""Get back to the estate now.""  
  
I couldn't care less about Alexander,  
  
But his mother had always been kind to me—  
  
She gave me the kind of warmth I never got from my own.  
  
I didn't want to upset her, so I called a rideshare and headed straight over.  
  
As soon as I walked through the front door, I heard laughter.  
  
""Well, look who came crawling back just because I sent a text from my brother's phone.""  
  
Vivian, Alexander's sister, was draped over the couch,  
  
Her arm linked with Charlotte's, as she sneered at me.  
  
""She's only ever had one skill—seducing my brother into marrying her.""  
  
""But now that you're back,"" she turned to Charlotte,  
  
""Everyone knows you're the one who belongs here.""  
  
""You're the only sister-in-law I recognize.""  
  
Charlotte gave a soft laugh and glanced at me,  
  
""Vivian, don't be too hard on her. She didn't grow up with much.  
  
She's a little tacky, sure, but that's not her fault. It's just... a lack of exposure.""  
  
Right. Everyone always assumed I'd begged Alexander to marry me.  
  
Everyone thought I wasn't good enough for him.  
  
Everyone believed it should've been Charlotte standing at that altar.  
  
I was just some nobody from nowhere, not even worthy of a seat at the table.  
  
""Vivian. Apologize to me.""  
  
Vivian scoffed.   
  
""And why would I do that?""  
  
""Okay, fine."" I raised my phone.   
  
""I recorded everything.""  
  
""I'll go play it for your mom right now.""  
  
Their faces changed in an instant.  
  
Mrs. Westwood had always been sweet, but Charlotte?  
  
She was the one person the old lady couldn't stand—  
  
Especially after the whole betrayal scandal.  
  
If she heard what they'd just said, Vivian was definitely getting an earful.  
  
Charlotte shot Vivian a look—don't blow this—  
  
Then patted her hand and turned to me,  
  
""Don't think just because she likes you now that your place here is secure.""  
  
Secure?  
  
I never planned to stay in this house anyway.  
  
I was about to walk in and say hi to Mrs. Westwood when Alexander came around the corner,  
  
Helping his mother down the hall.  
  
""What are you doing here?""  
  
I opened my mouth to tell him about the garbage his sister and mistress had been spewing,  
  
But the smile on his face caught me off guard.  
  
It looked real.  
  
I hesitated.  
  
Charlotte stood up, head lowered, her whole vibe trembling-innocent.  
  
""Lillian said I don't belong here. That I'm just an outsider.""  
  
""She told me to leave...""  
  
""Lillian?""  
  
The warmth in Alexander's expression vanished like it was never there.  
  
""She's always testing my patience, but Charlotte's here out of respect.  
  
She hasn't been home in years, and she wanted to honor my mother.""  
  
""And you show up late, then try to kick her out?""  
  
He glanced at his mother, who looked mildly displeased, and kept going—  
  
""Mom, you see it, don't you? Lillian has no manners.""  
  
""You really can't blame me for any of this.""  
  
""I regret marrying her every day.""  
  
Charlotte covered her mouth like she was embarrassed,  
  
But her eyes flashed smug satisfaction.  
  
Vivian crossed her legs and sat back like she was watching a show,  
  
Waiting for me to break down and lose it.  
  
But I didn't.  
  
Because suddenly, I realized something.  
  
I felt nothing.  
  
Not anger. Not sadness. Not shame.  
  
He didn't even have a single mood swing about Alexander denigrating me like that.  
  
When Charlotte had first come back into the country,  
  
Mrs. Westwood pulled Alexander aside.  
  
She told him not to mess up a stable marriage for someone who'd already betrayed him once.  
  
But you know what he said?  
  
""I can't even stand to look at her anymore.""  
  
""She pretends to be classy, but everything about her is forced and fake.""  
  
""My friends laugh at her, and she doesn't even realize it.  
  
She wears designer gowns like she's working a Vegas cocktail lounge.""  
  
""I don't see an ounce of grace in her. Nothing a real woman should have.""  
  
And the worst part?  
  
That dress—he picked it.  
  
Those manners—he taught them to me.  
  
He used to say I was radiant, untamed, the thing he loved most.  
  
But then that same fire became ""low-class,""  
  
Something to be ashamed of.  
  
I started staying home, worried about embarrassing him.  
  
Stopped going to events, afraid I'd drag him down.  
  
I tried to become the kind of wife he wanted.  
  
Took classes. Learned etiquette.  
  
But word got around, and it just became another joke—me trying too hard to be something I wasn't.  
  
Everything I did was wrong.  
  
Every version of me was the wrong one.  
  
""What, nothing to say now?""  
  
He looked me up and down.  
  
""Eight years, and still no kid.""  
  
""If it weren't for Mom, I'd have divorced you already.""  
  
Eight years.  
  
And not even a pregnancy scare.  
  
It's not like we hadn't slept together.  
  
But it'd been years.  
  
His interest had gone cold long before he stopped sharing my bed.  
  
And back when he was interested—  
  
He never once talked about having a baby.  
  
Even though he knew how badly I wanted one.  
  
That...  
  
That had always been the part that hurt the most.  
  
He knew how to find my wounds and dig into them,  
  
Using every fight to push me over the edge—  
  
To make me prove to the world I was exactly what he said I was.  
  
A crazy, classless woman.  
  
But this time?  
  
This time his words didn't hurt.  
  
They felt like freedom.

He asked me to go for coffees to discuss some work stuff, and then kind of started dragging along with me to events and asking me out. He’s perfectly lovely, but I’m a lesbian. I’ve only dated and only intend to date women. I told him that up front and said that I’d like to be friends if he wants. He’s not listening and says that maybe I haven’t met the right guy yet. I did let him kiss me (I have zero sense of self-worth, I know), as he was trying to prove something, but I told him that doesn’t change anything and that I don’t want to play with his feelings. He begged me to at least try. I said no multiple times and apologised for hurting him. 

There’s a whole mess in my head because I live in a quite homophobic country, my parents aren’t exactly supportive on that front and I always want to make them proud. And I am lonely, but I feel more like myself when I’m on my own than living an illusion, and I want to stand up for myself, though I find it hard and feel guilty. 

I actually enjoy talking to him, we have a lot of similar interests and I would like to stay friends. But would it be kinder to cut off contact with him apart from work to not hurt his feelings? He agreed to be friends but I know he still has some hopes. ",2,1745310778.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

Specifically I am looking for general feedback. But also on dialogue, character development, and smut quality. Here is a synopsis of the chapters completed. This does contain a smutty scene so please be advised.

Olivia and Ethan are nurses on a busy medical-surgical unit, bound by a deep friendship that has always walked the edge of something more. They share early morning coffee before each shift, trading jokes, stories, and stolen glances in the quiet hospital café. Once, she was his preceptor—now, they’re equals, but the tension between them simmers just beneath the surface.

Ethan is the boy next door: warm, flirtatious, nerdy, and endlessly earnest. Olivia is a free spirit with a magnetic energy, the kind of woman who listens to tarot readings and sings to her favorite pop songs in the med room. Their connection is undeniable, but it’s complicated by the fact that both are married with children. Their lives are full—of responsibilities, of obligations, of distance from the people they once loved.

In a flashback to a lake party, we see the beginning of their emotional entanglement. Ethan, then still a tech and in nursing school, talks about his wife and their two kids with familiar affection. Olivia, tipsy and off-duty, checks on him when he drinks too much and finds herself drawn to him in a way that unsettles her. She nearly kisses him—but pulls away just as her husband calls, anchoring her back in reality.

Back in the present day, the emotional line between Olivia and Ethan continues to blur. Over coffee and during quiet moments at work, they confide in each other about their struggling marriages—Ethan’s weighed down by the demands of parenting young children, Olivia’s hollowed out by years of disconnection. Olivia presses gently but deliberately, suggesting he deserves more. That she could give it to him. Ethan tries to resist, but her words and presence get under his skin.

Their bond finally combusts after a long shift, when Olivia invites Ethan to meet her in the locker room. There, the walls break down. They share a kiss—intense, hungry, and long overdue. In the aftermath, both are shaken, exhilarated, and acutely aware of the line they’ve crossed.

Now, their friendship has shifted into something dangerous, something real. And there’s no going back.",3,1745310716.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

I’m a mom to a toddler, co-running an agency on mediocre coffee, leftovers, and minimal sleep.

Hello everyone,

I've had my Picopresso for a few weeks now, making real espressos at home.

I have Saka Crema bar beans, and I can't get a balanced shot. I always have this very present bitterness that I can't get rid of.

I know a balanced shot is possible because I've already tasted it, so this bitterness is definitely ""adjustable.""

Here are my various tests:

I always use 12g in and 10 seconds of pre-infusion.

I have the 12g Picopresso basket and a K6 grinder.

K6 20 click: 43 seconds / 24g out
Over-extraction. Difficult to press.

K6 22 click: 30 seconds / 24g out
Good body, light bitterness, not bad.

 K6 22 clicks: 37 seconds / 24g out
Bitter, you need to pack less firmly.

K6 22 clicks: 35 seconds / 24g out
Bitter, go to 23 clicks.

K6 23 clicks: 31 seconds / 24g out
Bitter, test 24 clicks with 24 seconds for 24g out.

K6 24 clicks: 37 seconds / 23g out
Not bad, but pack too hard? Why so long?

K6 24 clicks: 21 seconds / 31g out
Still that bitterness is very present.

There you go.
According to this, which parameter should I change/test/check?

First, I see that my shots aren't very consistent, probably due to the tamping. My preparation is good: WDT, distribution, tamping.

 I'd really like to find a way to reduce this overly bitter taste. Is it the pre-infusion? The extraction time? The coffee weight?

1k518gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAustralian/comments/1k518gh/is_it_normal_for_aussie_guys_to_split_bills_based/,Is it normal for Aussie guys to split bills based on savings rather than income? Feeling unsure about my dating experience,"I’m dating an Aussie guy of a similar age (I’m a 29-year-old Asian girl, he’s 28). I’m in Australia for my Master’s degree, so I only work part-time at minimum wage (around $40k per year), which just covers my rent and living expenses. He works full-time with a decent salary (about $130k per year after tax). He owns an apartment (with a mortgage) and is about to go on an extended vacation for a few months.

In our first few dates, he paid for the drinks, and when we ate out (2 or 3 times), he covered most of the meals—I paid once, and whenever he paid for dinner, I’d usually buy dessert afterward.

At some point, we shared how much we had in savings. I was surprised to find out that I actually had more savings than him—maybe around 50% more. (Though if I pay off my tuition fees, we’d have about the same.) After that, I noticed he started behaving differently: when we went out, he began paying for his own meals and waited for me to order and pay for mine.

On later dates, when he paid for something, he would ask me to transfer half the amount back to him, saying I’m technically “richer” than him. He mentioned that he comes from a middle-class family, and I figured it wasn’t a huge deal, so I agreed.

I’m okay with splitting bills, but I prefer taking turns paying. However, what bothers me is the way it plays out:
	•	When he pays, he asks me to transfer my half.
	•	When I pay, he immediately transfers his half back to me.
	•	For small things (like $10–20 drinks), I don’t even ask him to split—I just cover it.
	•	But when we get coffee, he always orders and pays for his coffee separately, then waits for me to order and pay for mine.

I feel like he’s drawing really clear boundaries, and it makes me a bit uncomfortable.

Is this normal for Aussie guys—especially after learning I have more savings (even though it’s temporary)? Or is this just his personality?

1k5185u,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1k5185u/thoughts_from_first_trip_to_china_11_days_detailed/,Thoughts from first trip to China - 11 days (detailed),"Following u/tfrisinger's post I too am flying back from my first trip to China and was inspired to share a few curious thoughts and observations about the country. It was mostly leisure, part business as I visited colleagues, and spent a total of 11 days across Shanghai(5), Suzhou(4), Nanjing(2). I took mainly a mix of public transport and DIDI - did not use any tours as we like roaming with a free itinerary and we are proficient in Mandarin. However, my observations should be fairly universal in nature…

**Payments**

\- Ensure you register and bind a VISA/MASTERCARD to Alipay or your Wechat before you fly. You need to verify your identity on Alipay but the hassle is worth its weight in the hundreds of convenient services you will be able to use. China has long leapfrogged countries relying on card transactions to a cashless society of QR code payments, from street food vendors to ecommerce traders to private money transfers. Most people will say ‘我扫你‘ / ’你扫我’ meaning I'll scan you or you scan me, both will complete the transactions. We never had to carry any cash.

\- I find Alipay better than Wechat because of the interface but for good measure prepare both because there were some large transactions where wechat had blocked it but Alipay allowed through. 

\- Alipay and Wechat are not just payment/messaging apps, they are ecosystems in themselves. You access a whole host of other services from ordering your coffee, ride-hailing, to food delivery, your bus tickets, metro subway tickets, booking restaurants and hotels. If you don't have a local CN number, it is critical to have it set up in order to consume goods and services. The advantage of using Wechat / Alipay is that saves you having to register an account within those services which usually requires a China number. 

**Visiting Sites** 

\- A few particular highlights for me were the Shanghai film museum where we bumped into Aaron Kwok (an A-lister HK celeb) having a meeting in the cafe, the Shanghai film park where they filmed Kungfu Hustle / Lust caution, and the Propaganda Poster Art Museum. Then in Suzhou we found PingJiang road more intimate than the overcrowded ShanTang Jie, and in Nanjing the Massacre Memorial Museum documenting the 1937 ‘Asian Holocaust’ was curated tactfully. 

\- We were relieved that we didn't need book/reserve tickets in advance at most cultural attractions (with the exception of Suzhou Museum). The advantage of having a foreign passport is that you can simply turn up with your passport then and there. Think of it as your fast track pass - however best to always check. For CN citizens, you are required to book in advance, sometimes 7 days. This is not advertised publicly and I had to email to check or research Xiaohongshu vlogs. 

**Connectivity**

\- Use an esim / roaming package and activate it before you fly. I used Nomad and because it uses Hong Kong networks into China I was able to access 5G data with Gmail, YouTube, WhatsApp, Reddit without any issues. However, UK's banking sites were not. 

\- Do you need a VPN in China? In my opinion not really if you have close to unlimited data which you can simply hotspot to your laptop. The only situations where I can see a VPN being useful is if you wish to utilise high speed public WIFIs like at hotels or cafes and you need to access foreign sites/programs on them. 

\- If you have the luxury of having a additional sim slot or an extra phone, get a Chinese sim card without data (topup could less than £1) as a back up. This is to make signing up to accounts / accessing services easier, otherwise you may access all those services through Alipay / Wechat, which sometimes can be confusing to navigate with the amount of pop ups and ads. 

**Society** 

\- People dress modestly. We visited in Spring and even in the heat we couldn't understand in high 20s-low30s Deg why were people wearing long sleeves, long trousers and shoes and a jacket to boot! This doesn't mean tourists need to follow suit - we were on flip flops and shorts and found that nobody really cared. 

\- We generally felt very safe walking at night with the big cities being so orderly. You would see manned police ‘booths’ every 200-300m and needless to say, CCTV were a common sight. 

\- Members of the public were much friendlier and more hospitable than expected. Coffee shop or restaurant staff would use their personal phones when we struggled to use Wechat to order, and we would transfer them directly after. This was our experience even interacting with people in non-hospitality industries. 

\- Very little English is spoken, but where you could speak bits of Mandarin with them taxi drivers would engage in conversations, shop staff often asking where we're from due to our accents. It was intriguing to hear their perspectives of how locals perceive their city. 

\- We learnt from colleagues that due to 内卷 ‘extreme competition/rat race’, only 50-60% of kids make it to secondary school, and the rest will take up vocational education or enrol in polytechnics. 

\- There was the occasional public spitting we saw in public. 

**Transport** 

\- China runs a ruthlessly efficient transportation system from the booking experience right up to arrival. I wish the UK had imported a few features of it. Metro and rail were always on time, clean and had reception throughout. It felt like in Singapore taking the metro. 

\- Every metro station we've been in the three cities have clean toilets, and security scanners (the type you see at the airport). This was a big change from the UK where tube stations typically do not have toilets and you'd need to hunt for one in a McD or Pret. 

\- I bought intercity rail tickets directly from the TieLu 12306 app, and it was refreshing to not have to navigate through add-ons, insurance upsells etc. It requires ID verification and I would recommend setting up before flying. Once you chose your train time and pay, your ticket is your passport. No need to print paper tickets nor booking confirmation - just show your passport at the gate and that's it. 

\- Roads have a dedicated lanes for motorists and the cars do not share lanes with them, which does help with congestion. 

\- All motorbikes, taxis were electric. While this probably contributed to commendable air quality for a city like Shanghai, at some point we almost had a few near-misses as you could never hear a motorbike approaching! It was eye-opening to witness how advanced the state of automobiles were in China. 

\- On their Uber equivalent (Didi), you could see traffic light countdowns on the driver's journey which was great from a user's perspective. 

\- Similar to what you see in Japan, ALL rail train seats face the direction of travel eg you never face backwards. They achieve this with rotatable seats.

\- Contrary to the UK system where you have an inspector walk the whole train to check tickets, your journey is bound to a person's ID so your checks happen at the barriers where you scan your passport / ID. 

\- If you have the opportunity, try their business class seats (there are three tiers of train seats - second class, first class then business class). You get standalone seats the size of those you see on aircraft biz class. A typical biz class fare was 300-400 Yuan between Nanjing to Shanghai. 

**Food**

\- Shanghai and Suzhou cuisine tend to specialise more on dumplings/crab roe dishes and certain pastry snacks. There will be lots of casual eateries covering other Chinese cuisine and we used Xiaohongshu to look for recommendations / itineraries. Personal favourites were shengjianbaos from the 小杨 chain, and dumplings with 燕皮 (thin and translucent wrapper) from 千里香. Nanjing's speciality is roasted and salted duck - the breadth of Chinese cuisine is simply staggering.

\- All three cities had dizzying street food markets, stretching kimometres and kilometres of vendors. Combined with the massive light installations and neon shop fronts it was all abit sensory overload. We would wonder around 11pm and many stalls would still be full of food, thinking how much of that would be carried over to the next day. 

\- Opening hours are long - many casual eateries open early at around 7 and close late at night.

\- However while you can clearly find western cuisine in upscale areas and in business districts, there was very little variety of Asian food (Vietnamese/Thai/Korean). We found that Japanese sushi places were often tucked away at basement of malls…. 

\- Hotels use robots to deliver food deliveries to their guests, try ordering through Meituan to experience it. 

\- Virtually all eateries offer free tea, so we never needed to order any drinks. 

\- A quirk on trains was that cups came with built in tea leaves, so you simply added hot water to them - no need for teabags.

I currently earn £2,990 a month and have £4,500 in debt. On paper, I can save £2,000 a month easily if I stick to a strict budget of £130 a week for food and entertainment. I don’t pay anything for travel, and I don’t have any major expenses outside of that.

If I really stick to it, I could save £12,000 in 6 months — enough to clear my debt and build a decent emergency fund. But I keep struggling to stay consistent with it.

The biggest issue isn’t the money itself — it’s that saving this aggressively means spending a lot more time alone, cutting out social plans, and being strict with myself day after day. I also have the gym and exam revision to juggle (exams in June and September), so I already feel mentally stretched. The loneliness or feeling of isolation makes me want to break the budget for little things here and there — coffee, a meal out, etc. — and it adds up fast.

Has anyone else been in a similar boat? How did you stay motivated and mentally balanced while going hard on saving and debt repayment? Would love to hear what helped you push through.",4,1745310105.0,UKPersonalFinance,31,0.62,False

Part 1 is here (https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1k4t1qt/kyushu_road_trip_marchapril_2025_1_of_2/). We chose to travel around the northern half of Kyushu on this trip. We're looking forward to going back to Kyushu one day to explore Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Yakushima.

**Nagasaki** (2 nights)
* We left Obama Onsen and drove north because we had time to kill before getting to Nagasaki.

* at this point I realised that we were going to drive past the **fruit-shaped bus stops** in Saga prefecture and I just about died of joy. I hadn't realised I was going to get to see them. They are the CUTEST things. Best day ever.

* After that we visited **Takezaki Castle Fort Observatory** which is very pretty, especially surrounded by cherry blossoms. Worth a detour! Driving along this coast it looked like there were some excellent seafood restaurants (crab especially) but we were too stuffed after the ryokan breakfast.

* Brief look at the **Floating Torii Gate of Ōuo Shrine** and then on to **Yūtoku Inari Shrine** which is so impressive and a great walk up to the top. Wonderful to visit another Inari shrine like Kyoto's Fushimi Inari shrine but minus the crowds.

* Most of the shops and restaurants were closed but we still had a good and very cheap lunch of katsudon (champon for my husband) at **Katoukuya**.

* Then we drove to Nagasaki and checked into the **Dormy Inn Premium Nagasaki Ekimae**. I love Dormy Inn hotels and this is a good one.

* Got a tram to **Dejima wharf** and visited the Site of the Dutch Trading Post. Very interesting, especially as I'd read David Mitchell's novel *The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet* a few years ago. I'm going to reread it.

* The next day we toured the shops, visited the beautiful **Nagasaki Prefectural Art Museum** and walked up to the area around the stone bridges like the Megane Bridge which was pretty. Got a rose-shaped ice cream from a cart which was shaped quickly and skilfully.

* Delicious dinner at a small restaurant called **gypso** near the hotel. Small, modern menu and stylish interior (apart from us all diners were Japanese women in their 30s-40s). I had a potato croquettes set meal and it was excellent. Recommended!

* Took the ropeway up to the Inasayama overlook after dinner and of course it was great - what a view! We loved Nagasaki.

**Northern Nagasaki prefecture** (1 night)
* Checked out of the Dormy Inn and headed north. Looking for things to do on the way to our next stop, my husband found a garden open to visitors called **ハッピーテラス**, which translates as Happy Terrace. It's a terraced garden made by one man using lots of mosaics and European style decoration. It's so cool! The man who made the garden was so delighted to meet a gaijin who speaks Japanese he took us to meet his wife and have coffee in their home garden. A wonderful experience! Chatting to two older Japanese people on a range of topics tested my husband's Japanese to the limit.

* Incredibly good and fresh seafood donburi and ara miso soup for lunch at **海の家 あかさき** looking over the water. One of the best meals of the whole trip. His Instagram is https://www.instagram.com/uminoie_akasaki_223/ - just go eat there!

* Stayed the night in a fancy dome-tent thing at **Flat Glamping Nagasaki**. Unfortunately it was pretty cloudy so the views weren't spectacular but still very comfortable. It was half board with dinner delivered as some complete dishes and some ingredients to cook on the barbecue. Breakfast the same. Saw the biggest spider I've ever seen in my life the next morning (outside, thank heavens).

**Arita** (1 night)
* Drove to Arita with a detour to Okawachiyama. Loved Okawachiyama so much! It's just beautiful. Shopped for porcelain and got decision paralysis. I was so thrilled to visit Arita and Okawachiyama.

* In Arita we ate delicious soup curry at **Gallery Arita**. Had to have coffee because you get to choose your cup and saucer for coffee from the thousands on display.

* Checked into our little guesthouse in the historic part of Arita, **Zoku Ijinkan Guest House**. It's owned by a kind and welcoming artist called Shin who gave us wine and crackers and a lovely poster of his artwork which we will get framed.

* Shin recommended an izakaya **やきとり鶏頂天** (Yakitori Schouten) five minutes walk from the guesthouse. It was excellent. Truly delicious food and the owners so kind! The wife is the cook and the husband does front of house, although really they're both out front as she's doing everything on the grill in front of us. He said in English ""I am just the grinning man!"" He thanked us for visiting and then brought up pictures of New Zealand on his phone and said how beautiful it looked. Every single dish was served on fine porcelain.

* Bought a plate and soy sauce pot from **Kihara** which is fine porcelain with a more contemporary look. Walked to visit **Tōzan Shrine (Sueyama Shrine)** famous for the blue and white porcelain torii gate, and walked around the historic town walls and buildings.

**Fukuoka** (1 night)
* Drove to Fukuoka, returned the car and went to our hotel **Shizutetsu Hotel Prezio Hakataekimae** which was convenient for Hakata Station and comfortable. I love hotels that overlook train stations! Did last-minute shopping.

* Absolutely fantastic burgers at **FANK BURGER** for dinner. The owner is so cool and welcoming. Highly recommended!

Overall everything went to plan. Apart from accommodation and rental car we booked nothing in advance except for the baseball tickets. We've never booked restaurants and just like to find places as we go.

One thing I do is put something we need on the list and only go to shop once the list is long enough or urgent enough and by the time I go, usually half the stuff on the list I’ve figured out a work around or learned to live without. 

We’ve been talking about how excited we are to pay everything off and I’m just worried we’ll start spending more than we need to and ruin all of the self control we’ve built. I finally got an espresso machine I’ve been wanting for ages (before we knew), nothing fancy, like $130 so I can save by making coffee at home. Well, I’m in this habit of having buyers regret and then just returning stuff right away. Even though I’ve wanted an espresso machine for over a year I’ve felt bad about it and considered returning it. Once I heard about the bonus, now I’m thinking about getting nicer tampers and other things for it. 

Today, my spouse was cooking and using a can opener and it was ruining the can, and they were like, ‘I’m going to throw this away and add a new one to the list’ which was just different for them, they’re not usually so quick to want to buy something. I was like ‘we have another one in this drawer, and the electric one under here, we’ll be fine’. 

And I just know that once you start replacing a few things, it just snow balls and before you know it, you’re living beyond your means again. I know there’s a name for that effect I can never remember it. For when we replace a couch, then the carpet looks too old and you have to replace that, then you might as well get new curtains to go with the new color scheme, and before you know it you’ve entirely refurbished a room that was perfectly fine in the first place. 

How do you keep yourself living within your means?",1,1745309643.0,personalfinance,7,0.55,False
