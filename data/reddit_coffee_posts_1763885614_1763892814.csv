1p4j6bv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4j6bv,Tolly Café | ✨✨✨✨✨,"I originally wanted to post a google review but my review didn’t fit the word limit.



When we discovered the place while on a stroll in this quite nice neighbourhood, The Tolly Cafe looked like the front cover of a japanese novel about cats and cafes.
The place was so magical, I really cannot describe the homely melancholic feeling.It was an outdoor set up, be we couldn’t see anyone other than with this one man singing old bollywood songs with such good talent that it took me a while to realise that it was actually not playing on recored, this man is actually singing live. They had these little tiny bells to call for someone, it was so pretty i had this intrusive thought of stealing it for a sec. This man was so in his element we just sat there listening, looking at each other and the lights and the houseplants all around that were going wild thriving. After a while i realised it was getting get late but calling for someone was so intimidating at this point. 
To make ourselves be noticed and mostly because by partner wanted to, we roamed around looking the the plants. While i was wishlisting the ones i would like a cutting from if the houseplant gods appeared magically, the man now noticed us, stopped singing, greeted us with a gesture and called for somone. We now realised he is the owner. After a while seeing that noone has attended us yet he himself got up and served us an arrey of haphazard menus that had literally every cuisine with it’s elaborate menus on them. When we were going through the menus and he politely asked if we liked the place and how did we find it…we had a very polite conversation, a one that didn’t feel transactional. He offered us to sing on the karaoke, but we being we didn’t have the power to overcome the public anxiety. 
We sat in silence, he sang songs that were making us wonder how did we never find about these songs before, so profound yet so misogynistic, the music, the words being sung was putting me in a sort of calm trance. How did they come up with these songs? Were we as a civilisation always this depressed?
After a while someone else came to take our order.
We placed order for a hot chocolate,cappuccino and pink sauce pasta.
Hot chocolate came after a long wait, piping hot in this very cute small glass mug or lets just say a big cup. It was little cold and we were tired of existence but the sips from that cup of hot chocolate healed something in us and made us feel warm again. I was lost looking at my partner and listening to him talk about everything and anything, but mostly houseplants, and kept swimming in thoughts, that i never got to note the recipe that the man who took our order was making behind the reception table but I’m glad it happened that way because now i can always go back to this place once a while to heal. 
The chicken pink sauce pasta just tasted incredible while we were being soaked in warmth of the place and this phenomenon called being in love.
We were about to finish when the same man brought my coffee, and man i was trying so hard to hide my disappointment because i can tell about a cup of coffee by looking at it enough. 
But idk why I didn’t mind, it tasted like the coffee our parents would make in the late winter evenings before final exams as a bribe, we ended up mixing it in the small amount of hot chocolate remaining and made a mocha out of it xD. 
That was it, we asked for the bill, it came after a while, the same man came again with a dairy to note our names and numbers, disappeared for a but then came back with a formal bill, the total was 470/- and the rest tips. 
What I realised that it was owned by this man who is ridiculously cool and just wanted to make a chilling den for himself but then wife and son expressed their wish to run a cafe so the entire thing birthed to The Tolly Cafe, that this family loves and runs with the help of three other people who cook , clean and cater. 
A lot can be improved if we talk technically but the place wouldn’t be the same without the flaws. 
I only wanted one thing that is some kind of aroma in the air, specially because we were sitting in a open space surrounded by the kitchen as well as other house and the mosquitos. I wish they had lit some dhuno in maatir dhunochi, it would just take the total ambiance to a new level plus will be so much unique since closed places never have the opportunity to do this. 
And if maybe keep some furry friends. I know for a fact i would throw everything to a cafe that lets us spend time with rescued pets. 
Sorry if you were lookup for a quick review and found this instead. It just felt so good, this little story, i wanted to write it down. 
This place will be a core memory for me, i will go back again for the hot chocolate and for reliving a memory!!

1p4j5fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bangkok/comments/1p4j5fe/review_centre_point_sukhumvit_10/,REVIEW - CENTRE POINT SUKHUMVIT 10,"Area - Sukhumvit 10 right of Sukhumvit road one of the busiest roads in Bangkok. Madness at all hours of day. Planning something close and want to book a ride? Expect 30-60 minutes just to get there minimum. Coming back? Expect 1-2 hours in your ride if coming back after 12pm.  Traffic is wild. Sukhumvit road it just two large one ways that are divided by a bridge. Tons of stuff on the road and alleys, Soi 8 (Bars), Soi 11 (major tourist area), Soi Nana, etc. You won’t need to leave Sukhumvit road if you want to do everything but ride an elephant or visit a tourist trap temple. Terminal 21 is your closest mall and has everything you need, you can walk it all the way via the bridge. Korea town is to your right down the street and has tons of restaurants but was a ghost town when we went around 3pm. Platinum and Central World are near by about a 20-30 drive but are walking distance to each other. Avoid Palladium mall, it’s a dead mall, stinks, only floor 1 is worth (barely) even looking at. Icon Siam is about 40 minutes away, we left that mall around 3:30pm and it took us almost 2:30 hours to make it back to Centre Point. Tons of shady 💩 to do on Sukhumvit road, women, alcohol, weed, drugs etc. just wait until after 6pm and it’s literally shoved in your face.

Hotel - They catfish you. The pictures on the website (BOOKING, etc.) are not what you are purchasing. It’s dingy, old, everything is worn (furniture worn, wall paper peeling, showers, flooring) needs updating. This 30 floor building has ONLY 4 elevators. And if you are on floors 26-30 like I was then ONLY 2. We would wait 3-10 minutes each way, sometimes stopping 7 times before we could reach the ground level floor. Very annoying. The elevators are very old, tiny (they claim 11 can fit, I’m not trusting it) and look unkept. 

The rooms have A/C and they work like a champ. Room service and customer service employees are on point.

They have one ATM downstairs and a small 7-11ish type shop that opens at 10am. Came in clutch a few times but fair warning they do not sell alcohol.

Pools were as expected.

FOOD - okay, room service food is a “meh” the “America Style” breakfast is not that. It’s what they think it is. I’ve never had an American breakfast that served a salad (let alone no dressing), hot dogs (7-11 style), baked beans … only thing I could eat was the eggs. It was strange. And the toast was harder to bite through than a piece of rubber … how do you mess up toast? I’m thinking this was more of an ENGLISH style breakfast?

The dining area downstairs that served a full on breakfast buffet was like a whole new world of food with a whole different class of chefs cooking. It is AMAZING. Thai dishes, meats, pancakes, cereals, two high end coffee machines, fresh eggs, fresh everything. That was a great surprise, BUT if you don’t have breakfast included it’s going to run you ฿530 per person for the experience. It’s better to walk down the street 5 minutes and grab a ฿40 Pad Graw Pow from some struggling Thai cook honestly.

Shuttle service - awesome service, staff is friendly they take you ALMOST to Sukhumvit Road just one street before it. Try to tip them if you can afford it, I feel like they are like hamsters just running a wheel they can’t get out off, back and forth. It runs every 5 minutes or when every they get customer in.

Park! - The hotel is literally right behind Benjalkiti Park and you can walk through the gates when the times allow. It looks HUGE from the hotel but not as big as you think when you are walking it and there’s almost always people around. The park is also heavily guarded by soldiers in the park (most soldiers I’ve seen anywhere in BKK at one time), so the monitor lizards will think twice before making a move.

You can also access SOI 16 Aesops Greek Roof Top Restaurant by going through the PARK! Don’t be stupid like us an get a ride and spend 20 minutes in traffic just to get from Soi 10 to Soi 16 🤣 SMH!!!! We were lazy to walk the Main Street.

Shoot anyways, if you stay near or Centre Point Sukhumvit 10 you can and will find something to do. Just research a-little. We found out a bunch of shortcuts like a day before we left, the bridge allowing us to walk to Terminal 21 and further, the park behind the hotel allowed access at certain times, etc.

Oh yea - their cable tv SUCKS and system is OUTDATED (as everything else). It glitches out like on almost every channel. The Amari Pattaya was by far superior in every way.

And you better by some toilet paper the rolls are about 1/3 of the size of Americas and Paper towels? What’s that? Just do some premeditative shopping or else you will be calling room service once a day. The laundry machine is confusing AF if you not familiar with an all in one unit.

The Gym - it’s mid. 3 tread mills. Bare minimum weights and machines and a couple bikes. Just like the hotel, it’s the bare minimum.

Buy your self a converter for your electronics, I blew up my hair clippers lol. That crappy one for ฿99 downstairs didn’t help none. 🤣

All in all Centre Point Sukhumvit 10 DOES just enough to get by. I won’t be staying there again, location is spot on, but as mentioned they need more attention to detail on their rooms, inservice meals, elevators.

I did get a room for 6 people and had like 9 people up in there sleeping at one time and they did not gaf, so shout out to them for that. 🤣",0,1763892452.0,Bangkok,2,0.5,False

I had liked a post and saved one so I could come back today but it has been deleted overnight (or I’ve been blocked). 
If it has been deleted it’s weirdddd given the news that has dropped today. Can someone check and lemme know?? 

I think D4vd is admin, or owner, of a lot of his fan accounts to control what’s posted and hype up new song releases.

I wish I took more screenshots or did a screen recording, but the page opened early Aug 2023, and is dedicated to an obsession over a girl that doesn’t think about OP like he thinks about her - Sept 7th both years there was an array of posts, which correlate to what he was posting on his own main account. 
The best way I could describe the ‘Lol lol’ account was a sad one-sided romance, a bit creepy, and it sorta read like it knew the person whom poster was talking about might’ve been checking in and reading it, up until a few months ago, which is spinning me out with the new timeline. 
Wheeew. I’ve probably just lost it waiting for an update because it has been so sus since the beginning when the connection was made that he in fact knew the victim. The fact that he had been silent is even worse; and a person who has ‘grown up on the internet’ doesn’t just stay off it. Mf is lurking somewhere online, in one way or another.

Let's face it - night shift workers generally run on caffeine, and I work night shift. I can go through several cups during my shift and still go to sleep once I get home. To feed this addiction, I brought in a K-cup brewer and some K-cups. I'm also a little too nice for my own good, so I shared my coffee with my coworkers. Things happened, and I somehow found myself being the supplier to a number of coffee addicts on my shift. Fortunately, everyone has been donating to our supply's upkeep, so it isn’t that bad.

We have nearly unanimously declared a particular creamer to be the shift's favorite, so I keep a large container of it available in the community fridge for the coffee hounds that favor it. A big jug of it lasts about a week. (I swear someone might just be pouring themselves a cup of this stuff on a regular basis.)

Anyway, today I had to go grocery shopping and for some insane reason I dragged my husband along with me. (Shopping with him is slightly worse than shopping with a toddler.) He questioned almost everything on my list, especially the creamer.

""You don't need creamer,"" he said firmly.

""It's for work."" (I opened the cooler door.)

""You *don't need creamer*,"" he said even more firmly.

""It's for work."" (I grabbed the extra-large container.)

He tried to block me from putting it into the cart. ""You *Don't Need* that much creamer!""

""Who said it was for home? It's for work. It's my turn to pick it up."" I put it into the cart and gave him the Mom Glare.

""It's for work?"" Aha! The lights just came on.

1p4j1ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vasectomy/comments/1p4j1ra/my_experience_at_34/,My experience at 34,"I am 34, no kids and made a decision not to have kids. I decided to have a vasectomy and went private (I am in the UK). The whole procedure cost £1,850, this included the initial consultation with a consultant doctor. 

I decided to have local anaesthetic rather than general (I don’t like being put to sleep 🤣) and had my surgical appointment within 2 weeks of the initial consultation. 

I arrived around 9:50am with my surgery due at 11am. I was prepared and asked whether I had shaved my private parts, I now regret to say that I didn’t and this was done for me in the operation room. I was given local anaesthetic in one side of my scrotum, and this was rather a pinch than any pain. 

The surgeon then proceeded to take out the vas deferens (tubes) and you could literally feel the tugging of the tubes from your belly, which was a very weird feeling. I could hear him snip the tubes, I had some very minor pain but nothing that was too bad. The surgeon proceeded to jab the other side and do the same. 

I was stitched back up and out of the operation room by 11:30am. I sat down for a coffee and was back in work (from home) at 2pm. 

It’s been a month since my operation, and whilst I was being very careful not to get an infection, I am glad to have avoided that and now fully recovered. I do not currently have a girlfriend so don’t need to worry about using any protection, but due for an ‘all clear’ test early in January. 

If you are thinking about this operation, don’t think twice, just get it done and you’ll be happy and glad like me 👍

Also, I’m open to any advice.  If there are other advice for a complete newbie, here is my plan of action given my research:
- chisel sides using a flat screw driver
- sand sides and top 80, 120, then 220 using corded Bosch random orbit sander
- sand bottom 80 only
- light water wipes between sanding sessions
- hand oil using osmo poly-x clear satin
- maybe polish and restrain
- wax…(not sure what type)

Points really unsure about:
- drill to insert Nut Type D Hex Drive - is this needed? Size?
- screw  size to use given thinness of slab to not crack?
- leg type for slab to not break?

Planning for side recliner table, mostly for use of a book and coffee or tea cup…

Looking for some help to replace a laptop I use for remote work. I should be charging my cats who spilled a full cup of hot coffee on it but they’re deadbeats.

Will repay in full on Oct 13th. I have a current loan that will be repaid on Sept 29th with no issues.

I’m sixteen, and my symptoms are so ridiculous that even my psychiatrist basically threw meds at me and fled like she saw a demon. We’ll get to that scene later.



This is the full story of how I went from “high functioning honors student with angel skin and perfect routines” to “brain melted on the sidewalk” in the span of one semester.

# ACT 1: The Era Before The Collapse

Before this whole nightmare started, I was lowkey terrifying in how put together I was. Like… suspiciously stable.



My life looked like:

* skin clear like a fucking K-beauty commercial
* room spotless
* grades high
* routines perfect
* showered daily
* gym
* studied regularly
* motivated
* controlled
* thriving



I loved science.  
I loved learning.  
I wanted to go into medicine.  
I was proud of myself.



Then ADHD said:  
“Suprise bitch!”



# ACT 2: Childhood Chaos That Made Sense

When I was a kid, I had the classic hyperactive ADHD energy:

* bouncing off walls
* talking so much adults needed hazard pay
* no impulse control
* sprinting everywhere
* the usual ADHD kid trauma package

But as I got older, I stabilized.  
I could function.  
I had flaws, but nothing catastrophic.

Until this year.



It was like my brain did a hard reboot, but half the files didn’t load back in.



# ACT 3: The Shutdown (AKA When My Brain Filed For Divorce)

I want people to understand that this was not a classic depressive episode.

This was:

* neurological burnout
* ADHD shutdown
* executive collapse
* my brain unplugging itself out of spite



One day everything just snapped.  
Like a light switch.



And I mean **EVERYTHING.**

# The shutdown symptoms (bullet list of hell):

Physical collapse:

* slept thirteen to sixteen hours a day OR zero hours
* circadian rhythm is a joke
* stayed awake 36 hours straight without feeling tired
* body collapsed like a dead SIM
* chronic fatigue AND insomnia

Hygiene crash:

* stopped showering unless I had to
* didn’t clean
* didn’t change clothes
* room became a war crime

Executive function death:

* overdue assignments
* missed deadlines
* couldn’t study
* couldn’t initiate ANYTHING
* couldn’t climb out even when I cared

Emotional chaos:

* meltdowns over nothing
* happy episodes
* mad episodes
* crying episodes
* all in one week
* but NOT depression, which is important
* this was ADHD emotional dysregulation going feral

Cognitive destruction:

* either no thoughts or 400000 thoughts
* brain fog that feels like a loading screen stuck on 99 percent
* couldn’t read for more than a few minutes
* memory insanely good for random things

Behavioral chaos:

* no friendships lasting more than a year
* new obsessions every hour
* obsessive reassurance seeking
* constantly chasing stimulation
* constantly exhausted
* TikTok addiction
* working extremely well under stress
* working terribly when things are calm



And to make it worse  
I got sick for a full week during this.  
Like bedridden sick.  
So everything crashed even harder.



My parents?  
Zero support.  
Either argued with me or brushed it off.



# ACT 4: The Meltdowns

Let me be very honest, when my ADHD decides to play with me like a voodoo doll  
I don’t “get irritated.”

I have full-blown apocalyptic meltdowns over things like:  
  


THE WRONG PASTA NOODLES.



Yes. I cried because the noodles were a different shape.



Not burnt.  
Not ruined.  
Just… not spirals.

My brain:  
“We have been betrayed. Begin emotional warfare.”



The funniest part?

I am NOT spoiled.  
I’m dangerously polite.  
I apologize to furniture when I bump into it.



But one sensory disappointment and I’m sobbing like someone shot my dog.



Another story:  
  


One time I put on a T-shirt that I had worn a hundred times before, but that day the texture felt… wrong.  
Not scratchy.  
Not dirty.  
Just Wrong™.

I spent twenty minutes trying to convince myself to tolerate it, standing in front of the mirror like I was negotiating with a terrorist.

I genuinely started to tear up because my brain decided that fabric was emotional violence.

And then I changed shirts and instantly felt fine like a malfunctioning robot who finally got rebooted.



And if I get warm?  
I **immediately** consider committing arson.



# ACT 5: The Dopamine Apocalypse

Here’s where things got absolutely absurd.



Caffeine?  
Ha. HAHAHA.

* coffee does nothing
* energy drinks barely work
* I accidentally drank 1000mg of caffeine in one day and didn’t notice
* I fall asleep AFTER drinking a Celsius
* Vyvanse + energy drink = heart rate of a mildly interested sloth



My dopamine system is either dead, undead, or trolling me.



Let me elaborate on the medication part of this:  
I take Vyvanse 50 mg.  
It makes me feel… slightly happier.  
Slightly clearer.  
Slightly more human…

But that’s it.



I still have:

* never feeling satisfied
* always chasing stimulation
* constant brain fog
* random bursts of motivation followed by collapse
* thinking I can do ten tasks then doing zero
* needing freezing cold rooms or I freak out
* looking “normal” but feeling like a scrambled egg inside



And people always tell me:  
“Use hyperfocus as a superpower.”

Me:  
“I can’t even hyperfocus on hyperfocus.”

I hyperfixate on random shit like a malfunctioning search engine.



AND NO A ✨PLANNER✨ DOES NOT HELP DEBORAH.



# ACT 6: The Psychiatrist Scene (Oscar-worthy)

This was the highlight of my year.



I walked into her office and trauma-dumped EVERYTHING:

* the shutdown
* the emotional chaos
* the sleep insanity
* the caffeine immunity
* the sensory meltdowns
* the food addiction
* the hygiene collapse
* the executive death
* literally all of it



She looked at me.  
I looked at her.

We stared at each other for THREE FULL MINUTES  
like we were in a horror movie.

Then she blinked once  
scribbled something fast as hell  
grabbed a Vyvanse bottle  
tossed it at me like a grenade  
and practically RAN out of the room.



I have never felt more validated in my life.



# ACT 7: The Emotional Crash Aftermath

And this whole thing was and is so humiliating.

I am smart.  
I work hard.  
I love science.  
I love medicine.  
I love learning.

I am ashamed I let myself fall this far.  
  


But at the same time  
it felt like I genuinely had no control.

My brain literally shut down.



And the worst part?  
Even now that I’m medicated  
the symptoms stuck around.

Not as bad  
but still bad.

I feel:

* 60 percent laughing at the absurdity
* 40 percent genuinely struggling



I just want my old stability back.



# ACT 8: Questions For Everyone

1. Has anyone else had ADHD go from manageable to absolute nuclear meltdown
2. Do emotional reactions this intense happen to others
3. Has anyone had an ADHD shutdown that lasted more than a month
4. Does your dopamine system feel like it is haunting you
5. Does caffeine immunity this severe even make sense
6. Is sensory rage normal
7. Does anyone else work amazing under stress but collapse when calm
8. Does executive function ever actually return
9. Why does hyperfixation pick the most random shit on earth
10. And seriously… what do I even call whatever the hell happened to me



If you made it this far, thank you.  
My brain definitely didn’t.

G/Grift did not violate Rule2 …it is being used as a “weapon” to censor all subs who dare to highlight the truth, not just for one particular “influencer,” albeit that is far more prevalent and recognised due to approximately 7 subs being taken down in one swoop!

I was the support mod there (as you know) and we were fending off so many false reportings and blatant personal attacks.

When it was removed I was shocked, I saw it late as I am not in America so time differences played a part. There was no option to appeal and then for 🧁to be suspended, that was even more shocking to me. I am new, only joined Reddit after the tragedy and reading the police report, but not new to social media, have soul shatteringly lost my child and am old enough to be E’s Mother, so have wisdom in life’s experiences.

I was invited to Mod by several small groups and then left “hanging” so to speak... this is one of them. Reddit are using a “reputation filter” for her full name, any mention it is flagged/ removed immediately. Reports were mainly flagged as “harassment to me” ( amongst others which were unrelated to the actual content) that can only be made by the person who the post/comment relates to…make that of what you will.

Maybe I have been naive, but I have never “brigaded“ and didn’t know it was a thing until seeing all this, and it is known that new accounts were made by “fangirls” to infiltrate, i.e. playing both sides to get subs taken down. It was an underhanded tactic and is still happening. Were there some “members” who did the same, I cannot be sure, but not everyone on the internet has “good “ intentions, likes to stir up things for “entertainment “ even when a child has died sadly, thus making it more difficult to spread the truth! This needs to stop being made about personal attacks just because an opinion does not resonate with your own. It achieves nothing other than to cause division and filters facts!

Truth is being silenced for a one sided narrative and that is not justice.

There is a greater picture here that people are missing… corporations need these “marketing influencers “ to sell their wares, that really is all they do, they are “commodities” to push consumerism with the “enticement” of a luxury lifestyle… platforms such as TikTok make big money too.. do you think they want to lose their “top salesmen?”

A three year old child died in the most horrific circumstances, that child’s story is being “lost” in all the “chaos,” surrounding anyone who tries to speak the truth, and is being used to create a one sided narrative to alleviate “responsibility!” A real life child’s story, not some “ make believe boy” in a story book is being ”whitewashed” and that should make any normal human beings hairs stand up on the back of their neck! It is extremely concerning and should not happen! Has anyone else noticed that the “fangirls” sub was made only 4 days after that little boys death, that a well known crime podcasters video was removed? That Tik Toks or you tube videos made by smaller creators to raise awareness of the truth are targeted and abused?

There could have been so much “advocacy” for change to protect children used by “family vloggers” and this is what needs to be of concern and focused on… to raise awareness and implement legislative laws to keep babies/children (who have no idea of the implications of their lives been shown to millions, not just now but for their future) safe online and from their “parents choices “ whereby “minds” are clouded by designer bags, luxury cars, state of the art kitchens and how many coffees they can drink in a day!

It is not even not just pool safety awareness, that is like “shutting the gate after the horse has bolted” in this scenario and it is obvious by comments that thousands and thousands of parents are vigilant on pool safety! Think about this, have any well known “influencers” made a point of speaking out about it? Have they advocated, have they shown concerns that felony charges were recommended for child-neglect? Has a family member? That’s a big fat no! Why?

I believe, there is something much bigger at play here, it is not just to “protect” and “project” a “clean girl image“ to sell a “lifestyle”, and disregard anything that could taint that! It is to keep the momentum of the “influencers” influencing the “influenced”… the unsuspecting followers who it appears are young themselves and open to being blinded by “golden trinkets“ and “aesthetics”…thankfully more are waking up to the “you’ve been sold a lie” for cash and that’s a positive shift in the right direction for change.

However, thousands of businesses/corporations and their shareholders are highly invested in the “influencing for profit” era, there is a saying “ never let a crisis go to waste” and it is obviously being used as an advantage because they themselves, do not want to let go of their “wares!”

Recognise that platforms promoting “Influencers” are manipulating long standing social etiquette and healthy real life communities for a false “equivalence,” one that cannot and must not be allowed to stand the test of time.",2,1763891466.0,AZInfluencersSnark,1,1.0,False

1p4ivfx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4ivfx,Winter Cycling in Portugal – Practical Advice,"I’ve spent a lot of time riding in the southern half of Portugal during the winter months, and it’s a real good season for cycling trip. A lot of what I’m sharing here comes from planning routes for riders who come to Portugal for short winter trips, plus my own time on the bike.

**Weather**

South of Lisbon, especially near the coast, winter temperatures stay  steady. Most days are around **15–18°C (59–64°F)**, and it’s rare for daytime temps to drop much below 15°C (59°F). The Atlantic keeps things very even, so sudden cold snaps don’t happen often.  
From time to time you get warmer days reaching **20°C (68°F)** — more common in the Algarve, which usually runs a bit warmer. Nights generally sit around **6–10°C (43–50°F)**.

Winter is also a very sunny season here. Not summer-level sunshine, but plenty of bright, clear days and long sunny intervals, even when the forecast looks mixed.

Rain is possible, but not everyday and it almost never lasts the whole day. Most often it shows up in short periods — maybe an hour or two — and then clears again. Even during wetter spells it usually switches back and forth between showers and very comfortable riding weather.

Because of that, the best **strategy** is simply to plan a bit of buffer into your trip.  
If you’re traveling freely, add an extra day so you can wait out a shower if needed.  
If your schedule is tight, keep your daily distances a little shorter so you’re not stuck riding in the rain just to stay on track.

A small time cushion usually turns a “rainy day” into a normal sunny ride with a longer coffee break.

  
**Daylight**

Winter days in Portugal are shorter. Sunrise is around **7:00**, and sunset is between **17:30 and 18:00**. Temperatures usually feel good for riding from about 10:00, so your “comfortable daylight window” is roughly **6–7 hours**.

Once you add in a coffee stop, a viewpoint, a few photos, and lunch, that leaves around 4–5 hours of actual moving time, not more. That’s the number I normally use when helping riders plan winter days here.

A simple rule that works well:  
your realistic daily distance = your comfortable moving speed × 3–5 hours.



**Terrain**

Portugal isn’t flat — and the coastal regions have a steady rhythm of short climbs. They’re not long, but there are many of them, and they add up.

Our riders from flatter countries (like the Netherlands or Denmark) often find their average speed drops compared to home. Nothing dramatic, but worth keeping in mind when planning.

And the scenery is good enough that stopping more than planned is almost guaranteed.

  
**Wind**

If you’re riding along the west or south coast, wind is one of the big factors. Most of the year the wind comes from the north or northwest, which makes riding southbound feel noticeably easier.

In winter, southerly winds appear more often. Sometimes mild, sometimes strong enough that you really feel them.

The easiest approach — and the one I usually suggest to riders we work with — is to decide your direction (**north→south or south→north**) just a few days before you start, once the forecast is reliable. Portugal has plenty of train and bus options, so adjusting your starting point is usually simple.

A good tailwind in Portugal can make a day feel completely different.  


**Final thought**

Winter cycling in Portugal works best when you keep things simple:  
a bit of buffer time, slightly shorter daily distances, and a direction that matches the wind.  
Most riders who follow this end up describing their trip as “more like spring than winter.”",3,1763891430.0,bicycletouring,0,0.8,False

Hello! Which tone of colour do you think is best for a rug in here? I'm leaning towards light blue with an accent colour.... I'm also trying to think of ways to bring a little modernity to the space... I really love old things but I don't want it to look like a museum either. Maybe a modern coffee table and mirror on top of the fire place? I'd like to change that lampshade too but I'm scared of the electrics 🙃  
Thank you :)

1p4iluo,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1p4iluo/emotionally_immature_mother/,Emotionally immature mother,"Hey y’all,

I really don’t know what to do anymore. My mother is driving me crazy. She’s the most stubborn, emotionally immature person I’ve ever met. She and I butt heads all the time because I’m someone who’s reflecting on myself constantly and I’m pretty empathetic towards others. She on the other hand is not. She’s someone who would sacrifice herself to help others, she will go to work even when she’s sick and she’s always taking care of others rather than herself. I think it’s her love language? The other day at breakfast she wouldn’t even let me pour her a cup of coffee because she wanted everyone else to have their coffee first. 
My relationship with my dad is great though, he’s the best person ever. Sometimes I think she’s jealous of the relationship I have with him, but she’s not putting any effort into our relationship either. Sometimes I see other women with their mothers and I get sad because my mom and I don’t have that kind of relationship where we would just spend a day together. She will criticize me whenever she can, about my clothes or my hair. Mind you, I’m a woman in my 30s. And she will never take accountability for hurting my feelings or even acknowledge that she did, she will gaslight me and tell me that I shouldn’t be so sensitive. I’ve started to fight back and call her out whenever she would yell at me for no reason. She immediately starts to cry and gets upset because of it. I recently got diagnosed with ADHD and I think she might have it as well, she’s just like a ticking time bomb, waiting to explode because of the tiniest things. Just really emotionally unregulated and immature. 

Right now she’s in the hospital, recovering from a surgery. I called her yesterday after I returned from a shopping trip with my dad. She had asked him to get something from the pharmacy for her so he could bring it with him when he’s visiting her today. She asked me about it and I told her we didn’t get it - all the pharmacies were closed when we returned and we couldn’t get it in a drug store. Then she got upset with me - even though I didn’t know that we had an errand to run in the first place - and hung up on me, not even picking up the phone when I called her back. I was originally going to visit her as well today, but I’m sick and tired of being treated like that. I’m the eldest daughter and I have the feeling that my two younger brothers always get treated differently than I do. I just don’t know what to do anymore, I just want a normal relationship with her, but I don’t think that’s even possible at this point. 

I don’t even know if there’s any advice anyone could give me, I don’t think she would change. We would need some family therapy sessions or something, but she would never agree to that. Neither would the rest of my family. I just don’t know what to do and how to act, I just don’t wanna be treated like that from my own mother. ",1,1763890411.0,toxicparents,0,1.0,False

About 2 wks after the break up I txtd that I missed him and he said he missed me too. At that point I tried to set up a time to grab coffee but he said he was busy that week which I knew he had family coming to town that week. A couple more wks go by and I txtd again asking if we could meet and talk. He said he was having a busy week and that meeting up  wouldnt work out, but that he'd probably see me at a mutual friends party.

We were supposed to get married in four months. Been together three years. Everything seemed fine until about two weeks ago when she started going out more with her coworkers. She'd come home late, smelling like alcohol, barely talking to me.



That night she stumbled in while I was asleep on the couch waiting for her. I woke up when I heard the door slam. She looked at me and said, ""Why are you still here?""



I asked what she meant. She laughed, this weird bitter laugh, and said, ""I mean why are you still in my apartment? I think you should go.""



I sat up, confused as hell. Asked if she was okay. She rolled her eyes and said she was fine, better than fine actually, and that she'd been thinking a lot lately about whether we were really right for each other.



This was news to me. I asked where this was coming from. She said one of the guys at work made her realize she'd been settling. That I was ""safe"" but not what she actually wanted. That she deserved someone more ambitious, more exciting.



I asked if she was seeing someone else. She got defensive, said it wasn't about that, it was about her finally understanding her worth. Then she told me I had until the end of the week to find somewhere else to stay.



I reminded her we'd been splitting rent equally for two years and had a joint account we'd been saving in for the wedding. She said she didn't care, that she wanted space to figure things out.



I didn't sleep that night. The next morning she acted like nothing happened. Made coffee, asked if I wanted breakfast. I brought up what she said and she waved it off, said she was drunk and emotional but that maybe we should take a break anyway.



I said breaks are just slow breakups and if that's what she wanted then fine, but I was taking my half of the wedding savings. That account had about $18,000 in it. I'd put in $11,000 over the past year and a half.



Her face changed. She said that money was for OUR wedding and I couldn't just take it. I said there wasn't going to be a wedding if she was kicking me out. She started backtracking, saying she didn't mean it like that, that we just needed time apart.



I went to the bank that afternoon and withdrew my portion. Left her the rest. She called me 30 times before I even got home. When I walked in she was crying, saying I was being cruel, that I was punishing her for being honest about her feelings.



I told her I was doing exactly what she asked. Leaving. She said she didn't mean permanently, just for a few days. I said that's not what she said when she was drunk and honest at 3am.



I started packing. She followed me around the apartment begging me to stop, saying we could work this out. I asked if she was sleeping with the guy from work. She went quiet. That was all the answer I needed.



I called my sister to help me move my stuff out that weekend. When we showed up my ex had changed her tune completely. Started screaming at my sister that this was between us and she needed to leave. My sister ignored her and started helping me carry boxes.



My ex got in my sister's face. Literally inches away. Said if she didn't get out she'd call the cops. My sister said go ahead, we weren't doing anything illegal.



That's when my ex slapped her. Hard. Across the face.



My sister just stared at her. Then she pulled out her phone and started recording. Told my ex to do it again so she'd have it on video this time.



My ex lost it. Tried to grab the phone. I stepped between them and told my ex if she touched my sister again I'd call the cops myself. She started crying again, saying we were ganging up on her, that I was turning people against her.



We got the rest of my stuff and left. Filed a police report for the assault. My ex has been blowing up my phone and my family's phones saying I abandoned her, that I stole money that was for our future, that my sister provoked her and she was just defending herself in her own home.



Her parents called my parents saying I humiliated their daughter and that she's devastated. My mom said maybe I should have handled it more privately, that getting my sister involved made things worse. My dad agrees I had every right to leave but thinks I should have left the money in the account until we officially broke things off.



Some friends are saying I did the right thing protecting my savings and my sister. Others think I escalated by bringing family into it and that I should have just moved out quietly without making a scene.



But I didn't make a scene. I was just trying to get my stuff and she attacked my sister. The cops gave her a citation for assault and now she's freaking out saying I ruined her life.



Was I wrong to take the money and bring my sister? Should I have handled this differently? AITAH?",7,1763888488.0,FoundandExpose,3,0.89,False

Galaxies seem to be centered around black holes, I sometimes revolve around the hole in my pocket and Alice goes down a rabbit hole.   

Science goes one smaller and describes the wormhole.

On the way to enlightenment, on the western side of the road at least, we also have our holes. In fact, it is one big hole. The road goes inward, as you know.   

In a picture presented in the Kaballah we find the mysterious ""Sefirot"" of Da'ath. It has two aspects, the hole and the bridge. The hole is where you ""get sucked in, taken apart and pushed through"". That is probably what people call the Abyss. At the other end you find yourself back on the bridge. Some might call it paradise.

1p4i1n9,https://i.redd.it/gxye0g0d0z2g1.png,How does Meriberry still only have 405 listeners on Spotify? Her vocals and songs are amazing.,"Recently Spotify recommended me a Korean singer called Merriberry and she is amazing.

  
Her vocals and delivery are light and warm, and her songs are so perfect for anyone looking to ad to their Valentines day or love song playlists.

  
Since she is a smaller artist and YT, Spotify and etc. apart from one MV, most of her songs are just her performing Infront of the camera, in a room or in nature. But she makes it work.

  
For several songs i understand why she as a small artist with barely 405 listeners on Spotify is added to non official coffee shop playlist in Korea. Because she makes you feel warm, filled with love and happy. 

  
But honestly, why isnt she promoted more? 

Her vocals are amazing and if her company lets on the live vocal stage craze slowly building in Korea right now, this could make her.

He asks the stewardess for a coffee whereupon the parrot squawks, 'And get me a coke, you cow!' The stewardess, flustered, brings back a coke for the parrot and forgets the coffee.

When this omission is pointed out to her, the parrot drains its glass and bawls 'And get me another coke dogface!'

Quite upset, the girl comes back shaking with another coke but still no coffee.

Unaccustomed to such slackness the man tries the parrot's approach. 'I've asked you twice for a coffee! Go and get it now you old goat!'

Seeking some clarity.,"So I joined this new company back in December and found a guy cute, someone my eyes liked the site of. It progressed and it kinda became a crush. We used to give eyes to each other. He seemed interested as much as I was. But then few months in he resigned and left the job. I tried to let it go too. But then I thought, man I don't want to regret not reaching out, so I found his number from the office whatsapp group and msged him saying 'Hi, thought I would drop a msg, felt like we should keep in touch.' I msged this to him 2 months after he had stopped coming to office. He replied curteously by saying he was happy to hear from me and how he was wanting to send me a vedio but realized he didn't have my number. That was that. I had acted on my intuition and felt good about it. If he reached out after that good if he didn't that was okay too.

Cut to 20 ish days later he msged asking for some instant coffee recommendations (we had talked about coffee before) and wished me Happy Diwali. We again exchanged some friendly msgs and that was that.

10 15 days after that he sent me a flyer of an event he was involved in. ( I had asked an office colleague about the academic circle in the city and he had said that, the guy I am interested in, he would know and that he will ask him and let me know. They would have talked about it). Anyway, he offered to pick me up for the event and drop me back home. He was very attentive to me during the whole event. We grabbed food after that. Had a drink and talked a lot. We got to know each other a bit. It felt like a date but with no romantic undertones from either side. But there was this undercurrent of excitement and it felt great. 

After this though, we have not gone out or had sort of conversations. He had again forwarded his new office event flyer to which I didn't go as I was tired. I had then asked him if would like to go to this weekend event to which he said unfortunately he had some family commitments during the Weekend. Nothing after that. 

I am overestimating his interest I think. That I am aware of and working on it not occuping my mind as much. Can men on this subreddit help decipher what is happening here though from his end? ",2,1763887338.0,bodylanguage,4,1.0,False

The Michigan pollsters pointed out earlier: “This month’s decline in sentiment was widespread throughout the population, seen across age, income, and political affiliation.”’  
  
With oil futures below $60 (which I suspect is unprofitable for US shale oil producers) that suggests to me concerns of not an ‘AI bubble’ but concern for the future health of the US economy. With a seemingly relatively strong economy, it appears the US may be in danger of talking itself into a recession. Perhaps that is understandable given the heightened political volatility compared to previous administrations, together with the increase in cost of various staple products (e.g. beef, coffee and orange juice) following the imposition of tariffs this year.

Hopefully sentiment will pick up in early 2026 given ‘\[Scott\] Bessent promises that the good times will roll early in 2026, after the effects of the tax cuts and deregulatory features of the Big Beautiful Bill make themselves felt. And the trillions of new investments pledged by our trading partners begin to arrive.’

I had vertigo a month ago and the physio performed the epley manoeuvre on 24th of last month and I had residual dizziness for just 2-3 days max, everything was alright for a month. However, 2 days ago I had a swaying feeling, felt like i was moving but i wasnt (it is very light, almost negligible). I had given up on coffee 1.5 months ago as I felt if was causing me BPPV. I had had coffee after a long time 2 days ago because I had an exam, wasnt getting more than 3-4 hrs of sleep (no deep sleep at all). I was very uncomfortable. 

The swaying feeling is there but there’s no vertigo. I tried lying on my previously affected side too, but there was no spinning. This feeling isnt threatening. I am able to do everything I usually do. However, the anxiety is real. BPPV caused me so much ptsd that i havent been able to sleep properly and its been over a month. 

I also had other symptoms like chest tightness and muscle twitching. Im confused whether it’s anxiety or vertigo. ",1,1763886965.0,BPPV,1,1.0,False

I just need advice and to vent
Baby daddy is C.
Affair partner is L.
My baby daddy and I broke up on his birthday. I found out he'd been having an emotional affair with someone from his work for a minimum of 3 months. Not the first time either. I was just fully done this time.
2 weeks later, I found out she had just turned 21, was a virgin and is so incredibly naive and innocent. He'd changed his shifts to match up with hers exactly.
C was emotionally, physically and financially abusive.
He dislocated my jaw in an argument once because I'd found him cheating on me again. This time he did it in front of our at the time toddler.
C is manipulative and I went back to him every time with promises that he would change, he'd never do that again. Yeah I was a doormat. He did change. He found better ways to hide what he was doing.
Anyway. I tried to warn L about C. In the beginning she absolutely believed me. We met up for coffee and I showed her all the proof I had. Messages that he'd sent to random girls asking for sex and meet ups, the screenshots of vile messages he'd sent me, screenshots of the hour+ video call he had with a girl from facebook that he had in front our son to get his rocks off. Photos, videos, the screenshot that his mother put on Facebook the day he dislocated my jaw. Everything I had. I provided context and told her the truth about everything he did to me over 15 years. The things he did to me in the bedroom that I didn't like and he knew it but still did it. The things he pressured me into.
She believed it all. Then she told me what he did to her.
In her words, he hit my head against the wall so hard I had to stop and check I had a nosebleed. He pushed me onto the bed and started to take my trousers off. I was telling him I was nervous but he didn't stop. He put it in and I was telling him he was hurting me but he didn't stop. He just carried on.
We all know what that sounds like. I was furious and so hurt and I felt so sorry for her because I know what that feels like.
I kept C away from my child for a whole week. In this time, L had broken up with C. On the friday after that, C phoned me and I told him I needed to talk to him and his mother. He asked why I needed to speak to him and his mother. So I told him. I told him he was disgusting for what he did to L. He essentially SA'd her. He denied it. Obviously. He'd put me on speakerphone with his mother so she could hear everything I was saying. C unblocked and readded L on snapchat. The only thing they talked on because C could download and delete the app without me knowing he had it. He had to make a new email just to talk to L on it. One I don't know of. L messaged me to ask why he had done that, so I told her what was said between us. L completely back tracked and said she wanted it.
Not even 2 hours later, I had a call from the police. C had called them. They took my statement and L's number because C obviously didn't have it. She messaged me afterwards and said she'd told them it was completely consensual and he didn't do that to her. She was going to talk to C and apologise and clarify things with him. She was panicking. She said they were talking things out and planning to sit down for a conversation.
I'm assuming they've had that conversation and are back together because she's now ignoring my messages, checking on her.
I'm worried about her. About what he'll do to her. But there's nothing I can do. I already know he's lied to her multiple times and proved it to her. I'm just upset for being made out to be a liar over something so serious. His family are calling me every name under the sun and treating me like crap for doing what I thought was the right thing for my son. I just don't know what to do. I saw the fear and pain in her eyes when she was telling me. I believe her. I'm just devastated.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1p4hgch,https://www.reddit.com/r/DispatchesFromReality/comments/1p4hgch/regarding_jane_chapter_two_the_drawer_again/,"REGARDING JANE — Chapter Two: The Drawer, Again","She woke in a daze, the evening before fizzy in her memory.

Not gone — just effervescent, little thoughts bubbling up and popping before she could catch them. Her head felt carbonated.

Did she remember taking another dose?

She didn’t think so. She tried to replay the night, but her recollections came up soft and slippery. She had the faint strawberry taste of her emergency vape, but no memory of using it.

What did the drawer show her?

Because she was certain it had shown her something — bright, strange, or quietly impossible. But the harder she tried to grasp it, the quicker it dissolved.

Across the room, the flat looked suspiciously normal.

The bookshelf, usually prone to alphabetical rebellion, was perfectly ordered.
The kettle faced the wall in sulk-mode.
Even the rug lay flat — which was deeply alarming in its own way.

Jane pushed off the blanket, padded across the room, and crouched in front of the drawer.

Closed. Neat. Innocent.

A lie.

She pulled it open.

Everything inside was exactly as she’d left it: socks, tangled headphones, the lip balm that escaped her bag weekly, old receipts, the necklace from her dad, the mint tin from three summers ago—

Her breath caught.

There, centered neatly on top of the socks, was the Tesco receipt.

The one her manager had kept.
The one she had definitely not taken home.

Jane froze.

“No,” she whispered. “You were in Dallow’s hand. You stayed at Tesco.”

But here it was.
Pristine. Flat. Not at all crinkled. As if reprinted by some cosmic cash register.

She lifted it gingerly.

At first, it held normal text:

Tesco — Tilling Rd, Brent Cross
Till 4 — Operator: Dallow, M.
16:42

But the item list shimmered subtly, as though the letters were breathing.
And at the bottom — where the machine had glitched the night before — a line glowed faintly:

YOU FORGOT TO REMEMBER.

A cold ripple slid through her chest.

“Remember what?” she whispered.

The receipt fluttered once, then went still.

She set it back in the drawer, shut it carefully — too carefully — and stood up, forcing a long, steadying breath out through her nose.

“Coffee,” she declared. “We are having coffee.”

The flat agreed with unnerving quiet.

She filled the kettle, which, sensing her mood, behaved with saintly obedience. As she poured boiling water over the coffee grounds, the air steadied. Coffee was safe. Coffee did not rearrange itself in the night or deliver cryptic warnings.

She carried her mug to the little table by the window, opened her laptop, and began scrolling job listings.

Barista wanted — must tolerate unpredictable foaming machine.
Hard pass.

Receptionist for small dental office — teeth experience not required.
Unsettling.

Warehouse picker — cold environment, bring gloves.
Her lower back said no.

She shut the laptop with a sigh, finished her coffee, and grabbed her jacket.

Fresh air. That was the plan.

The cold air hit her cheeks with a sort of bracing honesty London specialized in — not refreshing, exactly, but clarifying, like a slap from a well-meaning aunt.

Jane tugged her jacket tighter and headed down the street toward the high street. Morning traffic murmured around her: buses groaning, bikes slicing past like irritated dragonflies, someone arguing loudly with their earbuds.

It was almost comforting.

Almost.

She wasn’t thinking about the drawer.
Absolutely not.
She was a responsible adult seeking responsible employment and not, in fact, being stalked by rogue stationery.

She turned the corner onto Chicele Rd., where the row of shops sat in their usual slightly shabby dignity. The chemist was already open — the neon “PHARMACY” sign flickering in a pattern that suggested either electrical decay or a personal grudge.

And next door, in the window of the delicatessen, hung a brand-new sign:

HELP WANTED — INQUIRE WITHIN
(beneath it, in much smaller writing)
Immediate start preferred. Must be comfortable with slicing equipment. And customers. Mostly customers.

Jane stopped.

The deli had always been there — old, crowded, smelling of cured meats and hopeful sandwiches — but she had never once seen a help-wanted sign. The owner, a stout man named Rami, seemed to run the place with the stubborn energy of someone wrestling the universe into compliance.

She took a step closer. The sign fluttered slightly.

There was no breeze.

Jane narrowed her eyes at the paper.

“Don’t you start,” she muttered.

The sign, unlike certain receipts she could name, behaved itself.

She glanced down at herself: boots scuffed, jacket only mostly clean, hair in a bun that implied she’d fought an owl in her sleep. Hardly deli-professional, but she needed a job, and deli work wasn’t Tesco. There were fewer barcodes. Fewer rules. Possibly more salami.

Also: Rami had once offered her a free biscotti when she’d looked especially defeated after a dentist appointment. A small kindness, but it stuck.

She hesitated.

Then, before she could talk herself out of it, she pushed open the deli door.

A bell jingled overhead in a bright, chiming way that felt almost encouraging — almost cheering, actually, but she decided not to think too hard about that.

The warm, savory smell wrapped around her immediately: smoked turkey, olives, pickles, fresh bread. It smelled like lunch and safety.

From the back, Rami’s voice boomed:
“One minute! If you’re selling energy contracts, I already have too much energy and too few contracts!”

Jane smiled despite herself.

“It’s just me,” she called.

There was a clatter, a muffled swear, and then Rami appeared, brushing flour off his apron.

“Ah! Tesco girl. You look—” He paused, searching for a diplomatic adjective. “—available.”

“That’s… accurate,” Jane said.

He gestured to the sign. “You’re here about the job? Good timing. My nephew decided he hates sandwiches. Who hates sandwiches? It’s unnatural.”

Jane stepped to the counter, trying to look employable and not like someone whose furniture had trust issues.

“I’m definitely interested,” she said. “And I can start immediately.”

Rami’s eyebrows raised. “Immediate immediate? Not London immediate?”

“Immediate immediate.”
Because rent was immediate too.

He nodded once, decisively.
“Good. Come around back. Let’s talk details.”

And as Jane followed him through the narrow counter gap, she caught a flicker of movement in the deli window — a reflection, maybe, or a trick of the glass.

Or maybe the help-wanted sign had shifted an inch to the left.

Watching her go in.

She ignored it.
Mostly.

Fifteen minutes later, she had the job.

“Start tomorrow. Nine sharp,” Rami said, handing her a small paper bag. “Celebratory biscotti. You’ll do fine. You’ve got a deli soul.”

Jane wasn’t sure what a deli soul was, but she liked the sound of it.

She headed home feeling lighter. Employed. Steady.
Like the universe had briefly decided to behave.

Until she reached her flat.

Inside, everything was exactly where it had been.
Exactly.
Suspiciously.

She set her biscotti down and reached for her phone. It buzzed instantly.

Marcy:
You free tonight? Because you’re going on a date.

“Oh god,” Jane muttered.

Marcy:
His name’s Fin. Vespa GTS. Thinks it’s a personality, just like your dad. You’ll like him. Or you’ll hate him. Either way, entertainment.

She groaned.

Across the room, the kettle clicked in what sounded like sympathy.

Marcy:
Wear something that says “mysterious but employed.” Also—CONGRATS ON THE JOB. I sensed it in my bones.

Jane froze.

She hadn’t told her yet.

She glanced warily at the drawer.

It stayed motionless.

But she couldn’t shake the feeling that something in the flat had known long before she typed the words.

With a sigh that was half dread, half resignation, she texted Marcy back:

Jane:
…where am I meeting him?

Her phone dinged immediately:

Marcy:
7:30. The Modfather Café. Don’t be late, the jukebox judges.

Jane lowered the phone.

The drawer sat in the corner of her vision, quiet and perfectly closed.

For now.

She shoved her phone in her pocket and walked to the mirror — old, oval, a bit tarnished — which obligingly tilted itself to give her a softer angle.

“Alright,” she told her reflection. “We’re doing this.”

Her anxiety hummed beneath her ribs. Socializing was hard enough on a normal day — harder when mysterious receipts were issuing vague metaphysical warnings.

She reached for her strawberry vape pen.

The flat politely pretended not to notice.

“Just one,” she murmured.

She took a small inhale.
Then, because she had a date with a man who named his scooter, a second.

Her chest loosened.
She could breathe.

Outfit time.
Perfect — here’s the next clean section of Chapter Two, flowing directly into Jane getting ready for the date, anxiety simmering, breaking her THC rule just a little, and the flat reacting in small, telling ways.

Tone stays warm, British, magical-realism, grounded in emotion.


---

REGARDING JANE — Chapter Two (Continuation)

“Pre-Game Anxiety”

Jane stared at her reflection with the resigned expression of someone about to negotiate with fate, fashion, and possibly a man who polished his Vespa.

Her mirror — old, oval, slightly tarnished — angled itself a hair to the left as if to soften the lighting for her. She appreciated the gesture. She’d had boyfriends less thoughtful.

“Alright,” she whispered, “just… don’t make me look like a tired potato.”

The mirror obliged, reframing her face into something closer to “mysteriously artistic but clearly under stress.”

She could work with that.

Her chest still felt tight, though — the kind of humming tension that made her brain pick at itself like Velcro. Normally she avoided any THC before leaving the flat, but dates were the exception.

Social occasions didn’t count.
That was the rule.
Or the loophole she’d written herself.

She reached for her little strawberry vape pen.

The flat went very still, as if politely averting its gaze.

“Just one,” she murmured.

She took a quiet inhale — soft, careful, a small strawberry cloud slipping warm into her lungs.
Then a second, bracing, because she was meeting a stranger and her brain wasn’t convinced she wouldn’t accidentally confess her entire life to him the moment he asked how her day was.

The tension loosened. Not gone — just softened, like a blanket being smoothed over her thoughts.

Her shoulders dropped an inch.

The drawer remained absolutely, aggressively shut.
Almost too shut.

Jane narrowed her eyes at it.

“Don’t start,” she said.

The drawer did not reply.
But the rug beside it rippled slightly, as though suppressing a comment.

She tried to ignore it.

Back to the mirror. Outfit time.

She pulled options from the wardrobe:

Black turtleneck: confident but vaguely funereal.

Mod-style checkered skirt: cute, but cold.

Rally jacket: reliable, slightly rebellious, smells faintly like petrol and Tesco.

Red lipstick: dangerous territory.


She held the lipstick up.
The mirror preened.
The lipstick cap clicked open in what felt like encouragement.

“Fine,” she said, applying it. “But if I look like a clown, that’s on you.”

The mirror tilted approvingly.

Her phone buzzed.

Marcy:
Remember: he’s nice. Or he’s tolerable. At minimum he’s human. Probably.

Jane groaned.

The kettle in the corner gave a tiny sympathetic whistle.

“Thanks,” she said. “At least one of you is supportive.”

She zipped her boots, grabbed her jacket, and gave herself one final look.

Okay. Not glamorous. Not disastrous.
Somewhere between “recovering English major” and “cute mod-era ghost haunting the Northern Line.”

She’d take it.

When she glanced at the drawer one last time, her skin prickled.

Still closed.
Still quiet.
Still absolutely plotting something.

She ignored it. Mostly.

The receipt inside — she could feel it — wasn’t finished with her.

But she locked the door behind her anyway and headed out into the evening, strawberry vape still sweet on her tongue, anxiety softened but not silenced.

Tonight, she was meeting Fin.

And she was determined — determined — to act like her life was normal.
