I have been using the Timemore Chestnut slim grinder for the last two years and I'm ready for an upgrade which will get me the most flavour and clarity.

I think I'm going to go with a 1Zpresso hand grinder but which one do I go for as there is so many to choose from. I want a magnetic catch cup and external grinder settings.

I mainly drink medium to meduim/dark roasted Coffee with milk and sugar.

Any recommendations welcome 🙏🏻

1hb2kpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1hb2kpf/black_pines/,Black Pines,"This was a very different case. Before I say anything else, let me explain—I’m a private detective. Most of my work involves spying on cheating spouses, doing background checks, or following up on missing items. Mundane, boring, but it pays the bills. At least, most of the time.

The day Mitch Philips walked into my office, though, my financial situation wasn’t exactly stellar. It had been a week since my last case, and my savings were starting to look as dry as the coffee grounds in my breakroom.

Philips was an older man, with gray hair and tired, sunken eyes. He had a certain nervous energy about him, like someone carrying a burden too heavy to bear. He stepped into my office and, before even sitting down, said, “I have a case I want you to investigate.”

I leaned back in my chair, trying not to seem overeager. “Okay,” I said. “What is it?”

He hesitated, then said, “It happened ten years ago. A massacre. Seven people died at a cabin in Black Pines, New Jersey. The killer was never found.”

Massacres weren’t my specialty. This wasn’t the kind of thing I typically handled, but I had to ask. “If the police didn’t find anything in ten years,” I said, “how do you expect me to find anything now?”

His face crumpled a little, and for a moment, I thought he’d give up and leave. But then he said, “I think they missed something—anything. I just need someone to look at it with fresh eyes.”

I shook my head. “I’m sorry, Mr. Philips, but I don’t take dead-end cases. If there’s nothing to find, then I can’t help you.”

He placed his hands on my desk and leaned forward, his voice shaking. “Please. My daughter died in that cabin. I need closure. I need this monster to be stopped.”

That stopped me in my tracks. I looked at him, really looked, and saw the grief in his eyes. He wasn’t just another client. He was a man haunted by something too big to let go. And that’s when it hit me—my daughter. She hadn’t been murdered, but losing her had left me hollow, the pain still raw after all these years.

“I’ll think about it,” I said, my voice quieter than usual.

That night, I couldn’t stop thinking about him—or the case. I thought about his desperation, about my own empty wallet, and about the possibility of finding something the police had missed. By morning, I’d made my decision. I called him and said, “I’ll take your case.”

Philips sounded so relieved, I thought he might cry. We met for lunch, where he handed me the details of the case and explained where I could pick up the police files.

By evening, I was on the road to Black Pines, New Jersey. The town itself wasn’t much—just a speck on the map, surrounded by thick forest. I couldn’t help but wonder why it was called Black Pines, though. The trees looked as green as any I’d seen.

I checked into a cheap motel on the outskirts of town. The kind of place with paper-thin walls and a rattling AC unit, but it was good enough for now. After I unpacked, I went to pick up the case file Philips had mentioned.

When I opened the file back at the motel, it was like stepping into a nightmare. Seven teenagers, brutally murdered in a cabin on the edge of town. The details were grisly—stab wounds, blunt force trauma—but the killer had left no trace behind.

The police suspected the killer was a large man, based on witness statements and the sheer physical strength required to overpower some of the victims. One of them, apparently, had been a star football player, yet he’d been found lifeless, his body broken.

The report mentioned a witness—a hiker who had seen a large figure leaving the scene late that night. The figure had been wearing a white mask and tattered brown or gray clothing, with what appeared to be red stains on his shirt. Blood, presumably, though the witness had been too far away to confirm.

In the early days of the investigation, the police had focused on a local bully who had harassed the victims before their deaths. But the guy had an alibi that checked out, and no history of physical violence.

Beyond that? Nothing. No fingerprints, no murder weapon, no motive. Just seven young lives cut short and a killer who had disappeared without a trace.

I closed the file and sat back, the weight of it settling on my shoulders. This wasn’t going to be easy, not by a long shot. But something about the case nagged at me, like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

Maybe it was the look in Mitch Philips’ eyes when he begged for my help. Or maybe it was the challenge itself, the idea that after ten years, I might be the one to finally crack the case.

Whatever it was, I wasn’t turning back now. Tomorrow, I’d head out to the cabin. If there were answers to be found, that’s where they’d be.


The next morning, I drove out to the cabin. It sat on the edge of a dirt road, surrounded by towering pines that seemed to block out the sunlight. The air was thick and still, the kind of quiet that made your skin crawl.

The cabin itself wasn’t much to look at. It was small, weathered, and cheap enough that you’d think someone would have bought it by now. But no one had. Not even the most desperate buyer wanted a place with this kind of history.

This was the site of the only massacre in Black Pines. The landlord, an older man with thinning hair and a wary expression, agreed to let me look around after I told him I was investigating the case. He didn’t seem to care much, though—just handed me the keys and walked away without a word.

Inside, the air was stale, carrying the faint scent of mildew and rot. Dust coated every surface, and the wooden floors creaked with every step. I knew I wasn’t going to find anything—ten years was a long time for evidence to disappear. But still, I searched, if only to honor the victims and their families.

One family in particular stayed on my mind. Two of the victims’ parents had taken their own lives in the years following the massacre. I didn’t know the details, but I didn’t need to. Losing someone you loved, especially in such a brutal way, was enough to destroy anyone.

It made me think of my own daughter. She hadn’t been murdered, but losing her had been its own kind of horror. She’d been so young, too young, when the lung cancer took her. I remembered the doctors telling us it was aggressive, but I never thought it would end so quickly.

None of us smoked. No one in my family had. Still, the lung cancer came, and it didn’t leave anything behind but grief.

After she passed, my wife couldn’t cope. I tried to hold things together for her, but I was falling apart myself. One morning, I woke up and found her gone. A bottle of pills and a note that didn’t say much more than “I’m sorry.”

After that, everything unraveled. My parents passed away not long after—old age, the doctor said. But I couldn’t help feeling like my grief had aged them, too. I had no siblings, no other family to turn to. It was just me and the bottle.

For months, I drowned myself in cheap beer, barely getting out of bed except to restock. Work? Forget about it. It took me months to even think about taking on a case again. And when I finally did, my parents were gone, too.

Even now, years later, I was still struggling. I hadn’t had a drink in a few days, but the craving never really went away. I guess that’s why this case felt personal. Mitch Philips wasn’t the only one looking for closure.

I shook the memories from my head and turned back to the cabin. My search turned up nothing—no bloodstains, no hidden compartments, no forgotten evidence. If there had been anything here, it was long gone.

From the cabin, I went to meet the witness who had supposedly seen the killer. He was an older man now, with a wrinkled face and distant eyes, like he’d spent the last ten years trying to forget what he’d seen.

“What did you see that night?” I asked him.

He sighed, rubbing his hands together. “I already told the cops everything I know. Even if I hadn’t, it’s been so long… I don’t remember much anymore.”

I nodded, though his response left me frustrated. “Do you remember anything unusual? Anything that might’ve seemed small at the time?”

“Nothing,” he said. “I’m sorry.”

I thanked him and left, feeling like I was walking in circles. So far, I hadn’t uncovered anything the police hadn’t already documented. Seven victims, no motive, no suspect.

I decided to dig into the victims’ lives next. Sometimes, the key to a case wasn’t in the crime itself but in the people it left behind. Maybe one of them had enemies, a secret, something that could explain why someone would want them dead.

But that search didn’t lead me anywhere either. The teenagers were regular kids—students, athletes, friends. I couldn’t find a single thing to suggest they’d been targeted for anything more than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The frustration was starting to get to me. Sitting in my motel room that night, staring at my notes and the police files, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was missing something. Something important.

I leaned back in my chair, closed my eyes, and tried to piece it all together. Seven lives, gone. A killer who had vanished without a trace. A grieving father desperate for answers.

I just needed to think. To see the bigger picture. Somewhere in this mess, there had to be a thread to pull. And I wasn’t stopping until I found it.

The days dragged on, and I was no closer to finding answers. My funds were running low, and I knew I couldn’t keep chasing this case forever without a breakthrough. Every dead end felt like a nail in the coffin of my investigation. Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that the killer had to have had a reason—something deeper than random violence. I just had to figure out what it was.

Frustrated and desperate, I decided to go back to the cabin. Maybe I’d missed something the first time. Hours passed as I searched every corner, running my hands along the walls, checking under furniture, and tapping on floorboards. Then, just as I was about to give up, I noticed it—a section of the floor that didn’t quite match the rest.

It was subtle, but the wood was slightly newer, the grain just a bit different. I tapped on it with my knuckles and heard a hollow sound. A basement? There was no visible door, and the landlord hadn’t mentioned anything about one.

I knew what I was about to do was illegal, but I didn’t care. This case was my last shot at finding something—anything. I drove to the nearest hardware store and bought a hammer.

Back at the cabin, I swung the hammer into the floor. The wood splintered with a satisfying crack. I kept going until I’d made a hole large enough to see through. A small room lay beneath me, shrouded in darkness.

It wasn’t what I expected. The space was surprisingly clean—not covered in the layers of dust you’d expect after ten years. Someone had been here, recently.

I lowered myself into the room, my feet landing on cold, hard concrete. Inside, I found a bed, a knife, a book, and a heavy box. The bed was unmade, and though I searched for fingerprints, I couldn’t find any. Still, I grabbed the pillow, figuring it might hold some kind of trace evidence.

The box caught my attention. It was heavier than it looked, and I struggled to lift it out of the hole and into my car. I followed it with the knife and the book, being careful not to leave anything behind.

As I examined the room further, I realized there was a narrow tunnel leading away from the basement. It was tight and pitch black, but I crawled through it anyway. The walls scraped against my arms and knees as I moved, my breathing echoing in the confined space.

After what felt like an eternity, I emerged into the forest. The tunnel led straight out into the woods—an escape route. The killer must have used it to flee the scene without being seen. But one question haunted me: how did the killer get into the cabin in the first place?

Back at the motel, I finally had a chance to examine the items I’d taken. The knife was large but not as big as a machete, and like the bed, it didn’t have any fingerprints.

Then I opened the box. Inside, I found a set of clothes and a small statue. The clothes were filthy, stained with saliva and semen. Disgusted but determined, I bagged them up for testing.

As I was about to leave for the lab, I noticed something strange—my car tires were flat. Slashed. Someone had been watching me.

I called for an Uber and got to the lab, where I paid to have the clothes tested for DNA. When the results came back, they revealed the fluids belonged to the same person—a man—but there was no match in any criminal database.

Frustrated, I returned to my motel. There was still the book to examine. Sitting at the small desk in my room, I opened it carefully, unsure of what to expect.

The pages were filled with newspaper clippings and handwritten notes. One reading “85 ?9// 3(5 [1/7(“. Each article was about one of the victims, detailing their lives, hobbies, and even personal struggles. But what chilled me most was that there was information about another person—someone who wasn’t listed in the original case files.

Who were they? A friend? Another target? Or was it the killer?

The notes were written in an uneven scrawl, as if the writer’s hand had been shaking. Phrases like “I had no choice” and “They deserved it” jumped out at me.

I leaned back in my chair, staring at the mess of evidence in front of me. The tunnel, the DNA, the notes in the book—it all pointed to someone with a deeply personal motive.

This wasn’t random.

But I still didn’t know who they were.

And now I couldn’t shake the feeling that whoever they were, they knew I was getting closer

I knew I was getting closer to catching the killer—closer than the police had ever been. The book I’d found in the basement was the key. Among the photos of the victims, there was one face that stood out: a woman I didn’t recognize. None of the photos had names, but her face seemed significant, almost as if she were the missing piece in this puzzle.

I should have turned everything over to the authorities then and there. It would have been the right thing to do. But I couldn’t bring myself to let go. The money I stood to make if I cracked this case was too good to pass up. After all, I wasn’t just doing this for the thrill—I needed the payout to stay afloat.

Sitting in the dim light of my motel room, I started brainstorming my next move. The pieces were finally beginning to come together, but the picture they painted was still unclear. Who was the woman in the photo? Was she another victim? A witness? Or could she have been connected to the killer?

My thoughts were interrupted by a sudden knock at the door. It was sharp and urgent, sending a shiver down my spine.

I hesitated, my hand hovering over my revolver on the nightstand. Before I could reach for it, the door burst open, the frame splintering as it flew inward.

I dove out of the way just in time as a man charged in, his face hidden beneath a ski mask and his body wrapped in a bulky jacket. Before I could react, he lunged at me with a knife.

The blade pierced my side, hot pain shooting through my body as he grabbed me and slammed me into the wall. My vision blurred, and I felt the strength draining from me.

Desperate, I fumbled for my revolver. My fingers found the grip, and I pulled it free, firing a shot. The man stumbled back, the impact of the bullet knocking him off balance. He clutched his chest but didn’t fall—he must have been wearing a bulletproof vest.

Still, the shot was enough to make him retreat. He bolted out the door, leaving me slumped against the wall, bleeding and gasping for air.

The police arrived minutes later, their flashing lights illuminating the chaos of my room. Paramedics followed, and before I knew it, I was being loaded into an ambulance.

The ride to the hospital was a blur. The pain was overwhelming, and my mind raced with questions. Who was that man? Was he the killer, or just someone sent to silence me? And how had he known where to find me?

I fainted just as the ambulance pulled into the hospital, the adrenaline finally giving way to exhaustion.

When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed, the room bright and sterile. My side throbbed, but the wound had been bandaged. A nurse entered, her expression a mix of concern and professionalism.

“You’re awake,” she said. “I’ll get the doctor.”

A few moments later, the doctor arrived. He was a tall man with a calm demeanor that did little to ease my nerves.

“What happened?” he asked, clipboard in hand.

“A man in a ski mask attacked me,” I said, my voice hoarse.

The doctor nodded, jotting something down. “You’re lucky the wound wasn’t deeper. We’ve stitched you up, but you’ll need to rest and avoid any strenuous activity for at least a few weeks.”

Weeks? I didn’t have that kind of time—or money.

They ran some tests to ensure there was no internal damage, then left me to rest. But lying in that hospital bed felt like torture. I couldn’t stop thinking about the attack, about how close I’d come to dying.

Whoever that man was, he wasn’t finished. He’d come for me once, and he could come again.

By morning, I decided I couldn’t stay there any longer. My bank account couldn’t handle another day of hospital bills, and the case wouldn’t solve itself. I signed the discharge papers against medical advice and took a cab back to the motel.

When I returned, the room was a mess. The police had come and gone, but they’d left everything where it was—my papers, the evidence, the shattered door.

I sat on the edge of the bed, clutching my side as the pain flared up again. I couldn’t let fear—or the injury—stop me now.

The killer knew I was close. That attack wasn’t random. Someone wanted me off this case, and they were willing to kill to make that happen.

But instead of scaring me away, it only strengthened my resolve. Whoever was behind this, they weren’t going to get away with it. Not if I could help it.

I opened the book again, my eyes drawn to the woman’s photo. She was the key—I could feel it.

If the killer wanted to silence me, it meant I was onto something.

And I wasn’t about to stop now.


When I arrived at the computer, I dove into the mountain of records, searching for any clue about the unknown woman in the photograph. I sifted through old newspapers, census records, and hospital admissions. After days of combing through documents, something finally clicked: a name.

Maria Longstaff.

She had been a teenager at the time of the murders in Black Pines, but there was more. She’d left town only weeks after the massacre and, curiously, had been admitted to the hospital the day after the killings for “unspecified reasons.” There was no mention of her in any police reports, no interviews, no photographs in the news. It was as if she had been erased from the narrative.

The coincidence was too significant to ignore. If Maria had been at the cabin that night, she was either another intended victim or someone with critical knowledge of what had happened.

I traced her current address to a small town called Rosemary Hill, population 2,574. It was one of those places so small and quiet it barely registered on the map.

I received my check for my recent expenses—barely enough to keep me afloat—and packed my bags. The drive to Rosemary Hill was long and monotonous, with stretches of highway that seemed to stretch endlessly through barren landscapes. But my determination kept me going.

When I finally arrived, the town was just as unremarkable as I’d imagined. Small shops lined the main street, their faded signs hinting at better days. The air was still, almost unnervingly so, as if the place itself were holding its breath.

Maria’s house wasn’t hard to find. It was an aging two-story home on the edge of town, its white paint peeling and the front porch sagging slightly under the weight of time. I parked my car and approached the door, steeling myself for the conversation ahead.

I knocked.

The door creaked open just wide enough for me to see a woman peering out. She looked older than in the photo, of course, but the resemblance was unmistakable. Her tired eyes darted over me cautiously.

“Who are you?” she asked, her voice wary.

“I’m private detective Wilson,” I said, pulling out my badge to reassure her.

“What do you want?” she responded, her tone sharp but tinged with fear.

“Do you remember the town of Black Pines, New Jersey?” I asked.

Her face paled instantly, her hand tightening on the edge of the door. “Um… why do—n-no, I’ve never heard of it,” she stammered.

I raised an eyebrow. “I know you were there when you were a kid.”

Her expression shifted from fear to something colder, more guarded. “Why do you care?”

“I know you were at the cabin the night of the murders,” I said, leaning forward. “And I think you know something about what happened. What is it?”

Her lips trembled, her eyes darting around as if someone might overhear. “I—I was at the cabin that night. I survived,” she whispered.

That admission hit me like a punch to the gut. A survivor? Why hadn’t she come forward? Why wasn’t she in the case file?

“Why weren’t you in the reports or the newspapers?” I pressed.

Maria hesitated, her breathing quickening. Finally, she whispered, “The town government… they’re cultists.”

Before I could ask another question, she slammed the door and locked it.

I stood there for a moment, stunned. A cult? The idea sounded absurd, but something in her voice told me she believed it—or at least believed she couldn’t risk saying more.

I knocked again, calling out to her. “Maria! I just want to help! Please, if you know anything—”

But there was no response.

I walked back to my car, my mind racing. If what Maria said was true, it could explain why the case had been buried, why she’d been erased from the narrative. But a cult? What connection could they possibly have to the massacre?

I looked up at her house one last time, noting the drawn curtains and the faint flicker of a light in one of the upstairs windows. Someone—or something—had scared her into silence.

I got into my car, gripping the steering wheel tightly. I needed more answers, and Maria Longstaff was the only lead I had.

But if there was one thing I’d learned in my line of work, it was this: when people start talking about cults, things almost always get worse before they get better.




Maria’s words haunted me as I drove back to my motel. “The town government… they’re cultists.” It sounded absurd, like something out of a pulp crime novel. But her fear was real, and it wasn’t the first time in this case that I’d felt the weight of something bigger lurking beneath the surface.

I couldn’t let her warning scare me off. If there really was a group of people in Black Pines with a vested interest in covering up the murders, that might explain why the case had gone cold for a decade. It might also explain the sudden attack on me at the motel.

Back at the motel, I started digging. If there was a cult tied to Black Pines, they wouldn’t advertise it openly, but there had to be a trail somewhere. I booted up my laptop and searched for any scandals, rumors, or strange connections tied to the town’s government.

Hours of searching turned up little, but one detail stuck out. Black Pines wasn’t just some backwoods, forgotten town. It had been unusually well-funded for its size. Over the years, state grants, private donations, and development funds had poured into the community. Yet the town itself hadn’t grown or modernized much. Most of the money seemed to vanish into vague projects labeled as “infrastructure development” or “community enrichment.”

That didn’t sit right with me.

I dug deeper into the donors. A few were local businesses or charities, but one name popped up repeatedly: The Brotherhood of the Eternal Order.

It sounded like one of those old fraternal organizations—social clubs for the wealthy and powerful. They had a chapter based in Black Pines. According to tax records, they owned a large property on the outskirts of town, a sprawling estate referred to as The Grove.

It wasn’t much to go on, but it was something. I made a note to check it out later.

Next, I turned my attention to Maria Longstaff. She’d said she was admitted to the hospital the day after the murders. I needed to know why. It wasn’t hard to find the hospital in Black Pines that would have treated her—there was only one. I made a call, posing as someone from an insurance agency looking to verify an old claim.

The receptionist was polite but firm. “I’m sorry, sir, but we don’t keep records that old on file.”

“Not even digitally?” I asked.

“No, sir. Anything over ten years old is stored in the archives, and we can only release those to authorized individuals.”

“Thank you,” I said, hanging up. If I wanted those records, I’d have to get them in person.

The next morning, I drove back to Black Pines and headed straight for the hospital. It was a small, aging facility with a worn brick exterior and an air of neglect. Inside, the receptionist was a tired-looking woman in her fifties.

“I need to access some archived records,” I said, presenting the fake badge I kept for situations like this. “I’m working on a missing persons case connected to a patient treated here ten years ago.”

Her eyes flicked to the badge, and she hesitated. “This will take some time.”

“I don’t mind waiting,” I said, trying to sound casual.

It took over an hour, but she eventually returned with a thin manila folder. “This is all we have,” she said, handing it over.

I thanked her and took the file to a quiet corner of the waiting area. Flipping it open, I found Maria’s name and a brief admission note. She’d been treated for a fractured wrist and multiple bruises. The injuries were consistent with “a fall or physical altercation.”

But what caught my eye was the section marked Notes from attending physician.

“Patient was visibly distressed. Repeatedly asked staff to contact her parents. Became agitated when police were mentioned. Claimed ‘they’ were watching and would kill her if she spoke.”

The phrase “they were watching” sent a chill down my spine. If Maria had been afraid of someone that night, it explained why she kept quiet.

I left the hospital and drove straight to the town records office. If the Brotherhood of the Eternal Order had any connection to Black Pines, it might show up in public records.

The records office was dusty and cramped, manned by a single clerk who barely looked up from her crossword puzzle as I walked in. I spent the next several hours poring over documents.

The Brotherhood’s name popped up again, mostly tied to land acquisitions and donations to the local government. What stood out was how frequently the same names appeared in both lists: the mayor, the sheriff, and several prominent business owners. They weren’t just recipients of the Brotherhood’s generosity—they were members.

The more I read, the clearer it became. The Brotherhood wasn’t just a social club. It was the backbone of Black Pines’ power structure. If they’d been involved in the murders—or covering them up—it would explain a lot.

As I left the records office, I noticed a man leaning against a lamppost across the street. He wasn’t doing anything overtly suspicious, but something about the way he was watching me set off alarms in my head.

I got into my car and drove off, taking a few detours to make sure I wasn’t being followed. Paranoia crept in, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was under surveillance.

Back at the motel, I reviewed everything I’d uncovered. A powerful group with ties to the town’s leadership. Strange funding patterns. And now, Maria’s fear of “them” watching.

This wasn’t just about a murder case anymore. It was about power, secrets, and people willing to kill to protect them.

I wasn’t sure how far I could push this before someone pushed back harder. But I knew one thing for sure: the Brotherhood of the Eternal Order was hiding something. And I was going to find out what it was.



The pieces were coming together, but I wasn’t sure if I was prepared for what I might find when they all fit. The Brotherhood of the Eternal Order, Maria’s terror, and the murders at the cabin—they weren’t isolated events. There was a thread tying them together, but every time I got close to pulling it, I felt the weight of unseen eyes on me.

I needed to be careful.

The man watching me outside the records office wasn’t a one-off. Over the next few days, I noticed strange cars idling near my motel, unfamiliar faces lingering in places I frequented. Whoever they were, they weren’t trying to blend in. It felt like a warning, but I wasn’t about to back down.

I decided to dig deeper into the Brotherhood, specifically their property known as The Grove. From what I could gather, it was a sprawling estate on the edge of Black Pines. Officially, it was used for “community events” and “private functions,” but locals seemed to know better. When I asked around, people either clammed up or gave me vague answers about “exclusive gatherings” that took place there.

Maria’s warning echoed in my head. “They’re watching. They’ll kill me if I talk.”

If the Brotherhood was responsible for the murders—or if they were covering up for someone—I needed proof. The kind of proof that wouldn’t just expose them but would also keep me alive long enough to use it.

First, I needed to convince Maria to talk again. I drove back to Rosemary Hill and parked a few blocks from her house. The place was dark, and her car was gone. She’d either skipped town or gone into hiding.

I knocked on a neighbor’s door, pretending to be an old friend looking for her. The woman who answered gave me a wary look but eventually told me Maria had left the day after I visited. “She seemed scared,” the woman added, lowering her voice. “Kept looking over her shoulder like someone was after her.”

I couldn’t blame Maria for running, but her absence put me at a disadvantage. If she had more information about the Brotherhood or the murders, I couldn’t afford to lose her trail.

Back in Black Pines, I prepared for the next phase of my investigation: infiltrating The Grove. I’d spent the last two days gathering intel, watching the estate from a distance and mapping out its entrances. It was heavily guarded, with high fences, surveillance cameras, and men patrolling the perimeter. Getting in wouldn’t be easy, but I’d done harder things before.

Before I made my move, I needed a backup plan. I went to the motel’s front desk and rented a second room under a fake name, using it to stash everything I’d uncovered so far. I photocopied documents, saved photos to a USB drive, and wrote down everything I knew about the case. If something happened to me, I wanted a paper trail that could lead someone to the truth.

I also reached out to Mitch Philips, the man who’d hired me. We hadn’t spoken much since I started the case, but I needed him to know how close I was. When he picked up the phone, his voice was shaky. “Did you find anything?”

“I’m getting close,” I said. “Closer than I think anyone has ever been. But it’s dangerous, Mitch. There are people who don’t want this to come to light.”

There was silence on the other end, then a heavy sigh. “I just want justice for my daughter,” he said quietly.

“You’ll get it,” I promised. “But I need you to be ready. If anything happens to me, I’ll make sure you get everything I’ve found.”

That night, I parked my car a few miles from The Grove and approached on foot. The estate was even more intimidating up close. Tall iron gates loomed in front of me, topped with barbed wire. Beyond them, I could see faint lights from the main building, a large, almost cathedral-like structure that seemed out of place in the middle of the woods.

I waited until the guards completed their rounds before making my move. Using wire cutters, I created a small opening in the fence and slipped through. My heart pounded as I crept across the grounds, staying low to avoid the cameras.

Reaching the main building, I found a side door that was slightly ajar. The air inside was thick with the smell of old wood and incense. The place was eerily silent, but I could hear faint voices coming from deeper within.

I followed the sound, passing through dimly lit corridors lined with framed photographs. They were group photos—members of the Brotherhood posing at various events. The same faces appeared over and over: the mayor, the sheriff, prominent business owners.

But one face stood out. It was a younger Maria Longstaff, standing off to the side in one of the photos, her expression unreadable.

The voices grew louder as I approached a large set of double doors. I pressed my ear to the wood and listened.

“…loose ends need to be tied up,” a man said. His voice was deep and commanding. “If she talks, it’s over.”

“She won’t,” another voice replied. “She’s too scared.”

“And the detective?”

A pause.

“He’s been warned. But if he keeps digging…”

The rest of the sentence was drowned out by the sound of footsteps approaching. I quickly backed away from the door and ducked into a nearby alcove, holding my breath as two men in suits walked past.

I knew then that I was in over my head. The Brotherhood wasn’t just protecting their reputation—they were protecting themselves from something that could ruin them. And they were willing to kill to keep it buried.

I needed to get out of there and regroup. But as I turned to leave, I heard a faint sound behind me—a soft click, like a door being unlocked.

I spun around and found myself face-to-face with a figure in the shadows.

“You shouldn’t be here,” they said.
 

The figure stepped closer, and the dim light from the hallway revealed their face—a man in his forties, stern and unyielding. He wasn’t one of the guards I’d seen earlier, but he was clearly part of the Brotherhood.

“You’ve seen too much,” he said, his voice low but firm.

I didn’t bother trying to deny it. “I know what you’ve done. You’ve been covering for whoever murdered those kids at the cabin.”

He smirked faintly, shaking his head. “You don’t understand. You’ve been chasing ghosts while standing in a fire. The people you’re dealing with… they don’t leave loose ends.”

“Then why are you talking to me?” I asked, my hand inching toward the small knife I’d tucked into my jacket.

He hesitated, his expression unreadable. “Because I didn’t sign up for this,” he said quietly. “It was supposed to be about power, influence—never this.”

Before I could press him for more, we both heard the sound of approaching footsteps. He turned, his face tightening.

“You need to go,” he said. “Now.”

I didn’t wait to argue. As soon as he disappeared down the corridor, I slipped back the way I’d come, keeping to the shadows. My heart pounded as I retraced my steps toward the side door, but I knew it wouldn’t be as simple as walking out.

Just as I reached the door, an alarm blared, flooding the estate with red light.

I bolted, sprinting across the grounds as shouts erupted behind me. A spotlight swung in my direction, catching me mid-step. I zigzagged to avoid the beam, my lungs burning as I pushed myself harder.

Gunshots cracked through the night air.

One of them clipped my arm, and I stumbled, biting back a cry of pain. Blood seeped through my sleeve, but I couldn’t stop. If I went down, I wasn’t getting back up.

I dove through the hole in the fence, rolling into the dirt on the other side. My car was still a mile away, and I knew they’d be hunting me. I forced myself to my feet, clutching my wounded arm, and ran into the woods.

The trees provided cover, but the adrenaline coursing through me was beginning to wane. My vision blurred, and I could feel myself slowing down.

Then, through the haze, I saw headlights.

I stumbled onto a back road, waving desperately. The car screeched to a halt, and the driver—a middle-aged man—rolled down his window.

“What the hell—”

“Drive!” I shouted, yanking open the passenger door and collapsing into the seat. “They’re coming!”

He didn’t ask questions. The moment he saw the blood on my arm and the panic in my eyes, he floored it.

As we sped away, I glanced out the rear window. Figures emerged from the woods, but they didn’t pursue us. I guessed they didn’t want to risk drawing attention to themselves.

The driver dropped me off at the nearest hospital, where I was rushed into the ER. The wound in my arm wasn’t life-threatening, but the blood loss had left me weak. As the nurses patched me up, I replayed everything that had happened, trying to piece together my next move.

The Brotherhood had underestimated me, but I couldn’t say the same. They were powerful, ruthless, and willing to kill to protect their secrets.

But I had something they didn’t know about: the evidence.

The photos, documents, and recordings I’d stashed in my second motel room were enough to expose them. I’d already sent copies to Mitch Philips with instructions to go to the FBI if anything happened to me.

When I woke up the next morning, a police officer was waiting by my bedside.

“We have some questions,” he said.

I nodded, my throat dry. “I’m sure you do.”

As I recounted the events at The Grove, I left out the details about my hidden evidence. If the Brotherhood had people in the police force—and I had no doubt they did—then the less they knew, the better.

After the officer left, I stared at the ceiling, the weight of it all pressing down on me. The case wasn’t over, not yet, but I’d survived. And that was more than I could say for most people who crossed the Brotherhood.

Now, I just had to decide what to do next. Would I keep chasing the truth, or would I finally let it go?

One thing was certain: no matter what choice I made, the Brotherhood would be watching.",1,1733839769.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

1hb2kec,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Comfortable-Bunch860/comments/1hb2kec/the_best_standing_desks_of_2024_buying_from_fezibo/,The best standing desks of 2024 Buying from FEZIBO,"# Why do I need a standing desk?

It is common knowledge that sitting is the new smoking rdquo; with many of us averaging over 9 hours a day sitting at a desk. In fact, according to;85% of workers experience discomfort on the job rdquo; especially in situations where they aren rsquo;t able to change postures during the day. As more companies began to focus on improving;wellbeing in the workplace ;it rsquo;s no wonder that sit-stand desks (or stand-up desks or sit-to-stand desks or [standing computer desk](https://www.fezibo.com/collections/standing-computer-desk)) are becoming increasingly popular.

nbsp;

First of all, we should note that standing all day can be just as harmful as sitting all day. nbsp;The best option nbsp;is to change postures intermittently, moving often from sitting to standing and even perching at a stool height counter. The ideal candidate for a [sit stand desk](https://www.fezibo.com/) is generally someone who is tied to a computer or phone at a desk and can rsquo;t easily get up to switch postures.

Another important consideration is the way in which you execute the roll out of [best standing desk](https://www.fezibo.com/collections/standing-desk) in your office. nbsp; You could go all out (if you have the means) and give everyone a height adjustable desk, but often this is not feasible. A practical option is setting up shared sit-stand workstations throughout the office for people to use as needed.

# What to look for when shopping for a standing desk

If you rsquo;re ready to buy a standing desk, these are some key factors to consider:

Size and appearance: First things first, the standing desk you choose should not only fit your home office space but the desk model itself should be suited to your height. Be sure to check the desk's maximum height if you are considered tall, since some desktops may not be high enough to comfortably use while standing flat-footed in your office.

Also ask yourself: Is the desk deep enough for me, and what shape do I need? We saw a range of models in our research mdash; some desks are narrower than others, and some are L-shaped. Consider the surface dimensions you'll need to fit all of your office essentials, such as a monitor (or two), laptop, mouse, keyboard, a coffee mug, notepad, etc. Ensure your standing desktop has enough space for everything without feeling cluttered, while also not exceeding any weight limits on the desk itself.

Adjustability: Ease of adjustability is key, and for the most part, our experts found electronic operation easier than manual. Though you can find some manually operated standing desks at a great value, we believe that being able to adjust your desk height with the press of a button makes you more likely to alternate between sitting and standing.

You should also consider motor output and noise. Not all standing desks use the same motor, so we recommend choosing one that works for you. If you plan on frequently adjusting, choose a motor that is quieter and capable of quickly lowering or raising the desk.

Ease of assembly: Standing desks typically aren't light, so pay careful attention to delivery style and any installation instructions. Some desks are more cumbersome to put together and may require two people.

Customization: Though you can buy a standing desk as is, some offer more room for customization than others. Does the desk have a range of desktop sizes to choose from? Various finishes to match your furniture? Can the legs be customized? Are there any accessories included or possible add-ons?

Durability and stability: A well-made standing desk should be durable and is expected to last several years, but it's always wise to check the manufacturer's warranty. Your desk should also be stable, meaning that it doesn't sway if you lean your elbows against it and there's not much shaking or moving when the height is adjusted.



# What are the health benefits of a standing desk?

Multiple studies support the benefits of standing desk, which include increased productivity and lowering your risk of adverse health conditions caused by sedentary habits. Another study published by the CDC found that use of a sit-stand desk reduced upper back and neck pain by 54% after just 4 weeks. Additionally, people who use standing desks report feeling like they have more energy throughout the day. Standing for a few hours every day can improve the quality of your work day, which in turn improves the quality of your life.

FEZIBO [height adjustable desk](https://www.fezibo.com/collections/height-adjustable-desk) are not just stand-up inspirations but some standard rectangular desks, there are endless possibilities! nbsp;

# The best low-cost stand up desk on the planet

FEZIBO is one of the best [electric standing desk](https://www.fezibo.com/collections/electric-standing-desk) that benefits from top-notch build quality and prides itself on stability. An issue which can be found with some standing desks is that they might be a bit wobbly, particularly when extended to higher levels. Uplift is nicely stable, though, thanks to built-in stability braces.

Ever since FEZIBO [standing desk with drawers](https://www.fezibo.com/collections/standing-desk-with-drawers) came along and set a new benchmark for standing desks, a lot of inferior imitations have appeared. Many of them, unsurprisingly, have had price points lower than Jarvis. We took this as a challenge: could we create a standing desk that rsquo;s more accessible to budget-conscious customers without sacrificing quality? The answer, it turned out, was yes. And the result was FEZIBO，An [l shaped standing desk](https://www.fezibo.com/products/fezibo-manual-crank-standing-desk).

One thing we knew from the start: we refused to reduce the desk to a single motor. Each lifting column on FEZIBO has its own dedicated motor which is key to providing a powerful, smooth, and stable lift when adjusting your desk height.

With a clean design and functionality as simple as it gets, FEZIBO nbsp;height adjustable desk nbsp; fits right into the flow of any office, home, or dorm room. It rsquo;s a desk that enables you to sit, stand, lean, and stretch throughout the day, keeping you moving, engaged, and loving how you feel while you work.

Just for background information:

I was neglected emotionally in my family of origin, had a hard time connecting with people in university (they found me likeable, but would always form close friendships with others), had extreme social isolation after university where I had nobody I could reach out to at all.

I now have a loving partner who has an extensive network of family and friends. Whereas I have mostly just him. I have been trying to build more friendships since forever but it just doesn't happen.

I feel extremely sensitive when he turns away from me to spend time with other people. Not everytime but more often than not I freeze up to keep the mask on, then completely spiral once I'm alone (crying, anger, thoughts of wanting to hurt him back or needing to end the relationship), then want to withdraw from him for days to recover.

This is just from him wanting to do some online gaming with friends while I'm at his house. Or knowing he'll have a family member over for coffee and I'm eaten up by envy + pain that I don't have these relationships. Just the fact that he is surrounded by love, always has been, when I am not, never have been, is so excruciatingly painful.

I'm sane enough to see that this is mostly a me issue, but just feel helpless how to deal with it. Looking for people who can relate or explain this to me or have been in the same place and somehow gotten better and share advice.",1,1733839687.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

Dear Everyone,

I’d like to share a special story and an opportunity for us to do something truly wonderful together. There’s a young girl who has been working tirelessly for years, taking care of and loving horses. Part of her daily routine is feeding, watering, and grooming the two horses we have, and she does it all with unwavering enthusiasm and dedication.

My wish is to surprise her this Christmas with a horse of her own so that she can finally have the joy of caring for her own horse and building a special bond with it, instead of only taking care of others’.

I am fully committed to covering the horse’s upkeep costs, as I have experience and can easily manage another horse alongside my own. However, purchasing a horse is a larger financial investment than I can currently handle on my own. That’s why I’m reaching out to this community for help to make this dream come true!

If you can contribute even as little as 2 EUR – the price of a coffee – we could make a huge difference together. I promise to keep you updated on every step of the process and share the joy we’re creating in her life.

If you’d like to contribute, please send me a message, and I’ll provide all the details. Thank you for reading, and even more so if you decide to help!

I am hosting a New Year's Eve dinner party for 8 guests and I want to know if these dishes go together well or if there are any issues that I haven't thought about. I also can't decide on the details of the starter and the dessert so feel free to provide advice! I like fancy plating, challenging recipes and budget is not really an issue so don't hold back.

1. Amuse bouche: there will be a spread of cold cuts, nuts, olives and some dips/bread on the table before guests arrive. I want to prepare two amuses (1 hot and 1 cold). For the cold amuse I want to make small bowls with ceviche or fish tartare but I haven't found any recipes that I really like so I welcome suggestions. For the hot amuse I already have small homemade shrimp croquettes from a previous party. I plan on serving champagne because almost everybody likes it and cocktails are a lot more work.

2. Starter: Can't pick between a giant raviolo (?) filled with ricotta and lobster and a lobster bisque sauce or just a regular lobster bisque, maybe with a chive oil (sans raviolo). Second option is of course a lot less prep.

3. Main: Braised short ribs (homemade demiglace) with saffron and white wine risotto, roasted broccolini and gremolata.

4. Dessert: pears poached in champagne with toasted almond topping, served with either a ricotta lemon cream OR caramel panna cotta OR champagne sabayon

5. Gourmandises/digestif: Other guests are bringing homemade cookies and some nice bottles (Cognac etc) to go with the coffee/tea",1,1733839349.0,Cooking,0,1.0,False

So I had my robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery yesterday morning (uterus, cervix, tubes). 
They gave me a nerve block, I assume it was similar to an epidural(?) because they used an ultrasound & it was injections in my back. 
Surgery was about 4 hours long and my doctor was apparently very excited that she got my alien uterus & fibroids out in one piece lol and other people in the room were impressed! 

Out of anesthesia, I was in severe pain & kept insisting I had to pee really bad, because it felt like my bladder was painfully full to bursting. They apparently did an ultrasound to show me that my bladder was empty, but I don’t remember it! I was in recovery about 2 hours, drifting in & out, they put heating pads on my belly & gave me pain meds twice I think; I’m sure being half out of it the pain was exaggerated but yeah…. It hurt. 

Once I started getting more coherent, had water, coffee, a muffin, cranberry juice, the pain was more just crampy & much more manageable. I was able to get up fairly easily, and my first pee burned, but I was able to & it hasn’t burned since. 

I got home & was awake the rest of the day/night, I didn’t think I’d be hungry but I ate a huge plate of spaghetti bolognese! 

Shoulder pain is no joke. It is awful, and my shoulder heating pad has been in use for most of my time home. Sleeping was difficult, I don’t like being on my back but it was just uncomfortable trying to be on my side, I hope tonight that is better. Belly pain is intermittent, mostly bad period-like cramps, but coughing sucks lol & I will get sharp aches & pains sometimes getting up or sitting down. 

I have a star shaped hysterectomy pillow that straps around the waist & neck, with a pocket for heating/cooling pads, and I’ll tell you what, that has been on me since I left the hospital, I love it! Highly recommended, it was like $17 on Amazon! 

I am currently wearing a 3 piece belly binder also from Amazon, and I kinda wish I’d worn it to sleep, because the pressure & the way it “holds things in” does make it easier to move around for me. 

I’m feeling gas moving around but very little has happened in that regard, and I’m not anxiously awaiting my first BM. 

Oh, and the oddest thing, the right upper corner of my lip is swollen & numb like I had dental surgery! I assume it’s from the breathing tube or something  but it’s actually very annoying & hasn’t gone away yet! 

Anyway. I appreciated all the posts I’ve read here, especially the post op experiences, so wanted to share mine! ",1,1733839294.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!**

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.

You know the kind—I’m talking about the sweatpants that feel like a warm hug but probably have seen better days. Here are some tips to help you feel that financial squeeze a little less intensely. 

1. **Bartering Like It’s 1999:** Remember when trading Pokemon cards was all the rage? Well, it turns out adults can do something similar with skills and services! Got a knack for mowing lawns? Maybe someone needs their website updated. Swap services with friends or neighbors. It’s like making a deal in a sitcom, but with fewer laugh tracks and more satisfaction when you save a few bucks.

2. **Free Tools Are Your Friends:** In the digital age, plenty of free tools are waiting for you, just like that last slice of pizza at a party. Use budgeting apps that don’t cost a dime—think Mint, YNAB Lite, or Even. Don’t underestimate the power of spreadsheets; they can be your best friend. A little Excel magic can help you keep track of those expenses better than a detective on a juicy case.

3. **Prioritize Essential Expenses:** This one’s akin to choosing which toppings make the best pizza. You’ve got to prioritize. Identify the must-haves—think rent, groceries, and, okay, maybe that coffee that brings you joy every morning—versus the nice-to-haves. Do you really need another pair of shoes, or can you make do with the trusty ones that have been there through thick and thin? Let’s be honest, it’s not a great idea to be shoe shopping when you should be making sure the lights stay on!

4. **Community Connection:** This is where it gets really fun. Dive into your community! Many local organizations, churches, or groups offer resources like food pantries, clothing swaps, or workshops on financial literacy. It’s like being on a scavenger hunt—but instead of searching for old toys, you’re hunting for gems that can help you keep your budget in check. Plus, connecting with others in similar situations can spark some wonderful conversations and insights.

5. **Track Your Spending:** Think of this as your new hobby. Take stock of where your money is going, down to those impulse snack runs. You’d be surprised how quickly a few bucks add up. Use a journal or your free app to jot down expenses. It’s like a diary but for your wallet, and it’ll keep you honest. 

6. **Get Creative:** Stretching a budget is like a creative writing exercise! Cook meals with whatever you have at home — yes, even that half-eaten bag of quinoa from 2019. Make it a fun challenge to create meals from what you’ve got, and involve your friends or family in the process. You might just unearth the next culinary masterpiece or, at the very least, a hilarious story for later.

By getting cozy with these tips, you’ll find it’s less of a painful budget crunch and more like managing a delightful puzzle. And remember: God often uses these tight moments as teaching lessons. Don’t shy away from the opportunity to grow—financially and spiritually. Every little sacrifice can be transformed into a testimony if we let it. So go on, stretch that budget, and maybe, just maybe, you'll end up with a little extra room for that fancy coffee after all!",1,1733839266.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------

The keto diet plan has gained immense popularity in recent years, appealing to those seeking effective weight loss and improved health. So what is the keto diet plan? At its core, this dietary approach emphasizes low carbohydrate and high fat intake, which helps to put your body into a state called ketosis. In ketosis, your body shifts from burning carbohydrates for energy to burning fat, which can lead to significant weight loss and other health benefits.

To better understand the keto diet plan, let’s break down its key principles:

- **Low Carbohydrate Intake:** A typical keto diet consists of only about 5-10% of your daily calories from carbohydrates. This drastic reduction forces the body to find an alternative energy source.
- **High Fat Consumption:** Most calories—around 70-80%—come from fats. This can include healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish.
- **Moderate Protein Intake:** Protein makes up about 20-25% of your caloric intake. It is essential to keep muscle mass while promoting fat loss.

One important aspect of the keto diet is that it encourages you to eat whole, unprocessed foods. Fresh vegetables, high-quality meats, and healthy fats play a vital role in fueling your body while minimizing sugar and refined carbohydrates.

So why do people opt for the keto diet plan? The benefits can be quite compelling:

- **Weight Loss:** The primary reason many individuals try the keto diet is for rapid weight loss. With the body burning fat for fuel, users often notice quick results on the scale.
- **Improved Energy Levels:** Once your body becomes efficient at burning fat, you may experience more consistent energy levels throughout the day. You might find less of that dreaded afternoon slump.
- **Better Mental Clarity:** Many keto followers report improved focus and mental clarity. This enhanced cognitive function can be attributed to the ketones produced during ketosis.
- **Reduced Hunger Cravings:** The high-fat nature of the diet can help keep you feeling full longer. This reduces the urge to snack mindlessly, aiding in weight management.
- **Stable Blood Sugar Levels:** A well-structured keto diet can help stabilize blood sugar levels. This can be beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes or those looking to manage their blood sugar more effectively.

To successfully follow the keto diet plan, it's essential to understand which foods to eat and which to avoid. Here’s a simple list to guide you:

Check The Details Here: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Foods to Include:

- Sugars (e.g., candy, baked goods, sweetened beverages)

- Starchy Vegetables (e.g., potatoes, corn)
- Processed Foods (e.g., chips, fast foods)

While the keto diet plan has proven beneficial for many, it’s also essential to approach it with care. Individual responses can vary, and what works for one person may not work for another. Before starting any new diet, particularly one as strict as keto, you should consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions.

By understanding its principles and following the recommended food guidelines, you can effectively transition to this low-carb, high-fat lifestyle. When done correctly, it may lead to positive changes in your physical and mental wellbeing.

I'm 18 and living on my own in a mid-sized city in the US. I was originally living with my sister, but to cut the long story short things didn't work out with the situation and I was forced to find somewhere to live on my own. My lease at my current place ends in March, but with the amount of money I have saved up, I don't think I have enough to make it to then without working. 

I graduated high school, and have my diploma, along with an almost finished associate's thanks to the program I was in, it was like Dual Enrollment but with some additional perks as well. I've been scouring every job board I can think of and applied to probably 60 or so different jobs, mostly remote / wfh but also some in person, in the last month since I've been unemployed. 

What do I bring to the table? Well, I had a 1-year long internship at a bank before I moved out, and I'm generally capable of doing most financial tasks short of accounting. Financial math, transfers, account management, all that stuff. I've worked in a coffee shop and for a pizza place, so I have experience in both customer service and food preparation. I think my best skill in most settings is my ability to write though. I've been told by teachers and a lot of people I've come across that I'm good with words and some of my papers in college level sociology and psychology were praised and used as good examples. My last job, I worked as a mid-level manager for a political campaign, and the only thing I'll say is that when I had to write end-of-day reports, I was usually the only one that didn't have to re-write or use some form of AI assistance because I was able to compose them to a good enough level. 

As far as actual certifications, I've been certified and ""fluent"" if you wanna say it that way in Microsoft Office for years at this point, I know my way around Word, PPT, Excel, and to a similar extent Google Sheets and Google Docs. I have an Adobe Photoshop Cert but I wouldn't call myself skilled at photoshop, I just passed the class. 

The biggest problem in my search so far is that regardless of if the company I'm looking at pays $50k a year or $150k, they all want some form of professional experience mixed in with a Bachelor's or Master's Degree, and I'm having an extremely hard time finding anything that I fit the mold of or that will even give me a chance. I applied to a few positions yesterday morning and one of them took exactly 2 hours from the moment they viewed my application to sending me the email telling me they are pursuing someone else.

I am currently a sophomore in college. I have been single and never in a serious relationship before besides a middle school ‘boyfriend’ that didn’t really count lol. 

I have had some unhealthy situations with men in the past that have basically over sexualized me and wanted to use me for my body. From there I decided to work on myself, lose some weight and get fit, be independent and focused in school, make my job a priority to earn my own money, and try to heal from some past trauma with therapy. 

I have been doing this for about 2 years now and I ultimately think I have a lot higher standards than I did before. I do get pretty lonely though. All of my friends are in relationships and have experienced quite a lot. I just kinda want to be able to experience a genuine connection with someone. I feel like I ask a lot but I don’t want to risk all the good work I’ve put in for myself just to settle for someone who isn’t going to love me the way I’d like to be loved. I will agree that I do tend to be a more introverted person and pretty busy with school/work. I also find myself being attracted to men who are stable and emotionally mature, but later to find out they are in relationships themselves already which is a bummer. 

Mainly there’s this guy who comes into my work who is really nerdy but really cute I think. I really was like wow I haven’t really thought I’d meet someone while making them coffee. He’s a regular and so I see him quite a bit. However the other day he comes in and then his girlfriend does who gives me the ultimate look of like, stay away from him. That was uh a bit of a rude awakening. So yeah now I’m sad but it’s whatever really. I know there’s nothing I could do. 

My question is, what do I do now? Should I be trying different things to attract the right dudes?

I wanted to share my experience and knowledge about food processors since I've been using them for years in my kitchen. Trust me, they're absolute game-changers when it comes to meal prep!

A food processor typically looks like a sturdy kitchen appliance with a clear plastic work bowl sitting on top of a motorized base. Think of it as your personal kitchen assistant that can chop, slice, and dice almost anything. The bowl usually has measurements marked on the side, which is super helpful when following recipes.

The most noticeable part is the sharp blade system in the center of the bowl. It's basically like having a professional chef's knife skills in machine form! Most models come with multiple blade attachments - you've got your S-shaped blade for chopping and pureeing, and disc-shaped ones for slicing and shredding.

On the front, you'll find simple controls - usually just a few buttons or dials. Nothing complicated, which I love because who needs extra confusion in the kitchen? The lid locks firmly on top for safety (trust me, you don't want your smoothie ingredients flying everywhere!).

Size-wise, they range from mini choppers to full-sized beasts. I'd say an average food processor is about the size of a coffee maker, but shorter and wider. They usually come in neutral colors like white, black, or silver to match any kitchen decor.

Speaking of food processors, I recently found some amazing deals on various models. If you're interested in getting one for yourself, check out this collection here: https://athometouch.com/foodprocessor

What I really love about modern food processors is their sleek design. They're not those bulky, ugly appliances from the 80s anymore! The transparent bowl lets you watch the magic happen, which is oddly satisfying. Plus, most parts are dishwasher-safe, making cleanup a breeze.

The feed tube on top is another cool feature - it's like a chimney where you can add ingredients while the processor is running. Some even come with different-sized pushers to help guide smaller items safely.

One thing that surprised me when I first got mine was how stable it is. The base usually has rubber feet that keep it firmly planted on your counter, even when processing tougher ingredients like nuts or frozen fruit.

Just remember, a good food processor is an investment that'll save you countless hours of manual chopping and prepping. It's basically like having a sous chef in your kitchen, minus the attitude!

Let me know if you have any questions about food processors - I'm always happy to help fellow cooking enthusiasts!",1,1733838704.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

I overheard a conversation between a customer and a starbucks employee. The employee greeted the guy with ""Hello Sir, what do you want?"". The guy answered ""Actually i identify as a gay Woman"". The employee apologized immediately.

Thats when a 7 foot tall, fully tattooed, build like a brick shit house, wearing an AR15, MAGA wannabe tactical soldier chimed in ""NO YOU ARENT, YOU ARE A MAN"".

The whole store went dead silent.

Everyone was scared shitless.

Thats when I just had to say something. I was also scared but knew this was not ok. 

""SIR, how DARE you! You are a BIGOT! This LADY is a real woman, its 2024 and she can be whatever she wants to be. Theres no difference between her and me. Dont you ever say something like this again when im around!!!!!""

""Did you say something?""

I almost shit my pants but knew i had to stood up for LGBQT+ rights disregarding my own safety because its the righteous thing to do.

""YES, i said something! You should leave now!""

He left, went into his TRUMP 2025 labeled ford raptor truck and drove off.

The whole store applauded and cheered.

I know it was the right thing to do, but i also had some conflicting emotions. Did I took HER moment away to stand up for herself as a strong, independent woman?

And I also only tipped 50% for my coffee, i feel horrible in hindsight.

\-Service is better than I expected given reviews. Staff is warm and friendly, especially at the bars. A smile and a kind word goes a long way. And remember you're on island time. 

\-Despite better than expected service, the coffee at Pietras was cold. I believe they either leave the carafes sitting around filled or re-use carafes that they believe are full but were left over. For the best coffee. it's the french presses at Aolos. Or go to the cafe next store and grab a hot cup to go. 

\-The entertainment was really fun! Don't sleep on the beach-side entertainment which included fire dancers. 

\-KatsuKatsu had great sushi and the signature drink is my favorite on the island. 

\-Chocolate martinis are addictive and delish. 

\-We did a shopping excursion for 2 hours. Having been to several ""downtowns"" I have to say that this one is meh. I wasn't impressed, and TBH it looks prettier in pictures than real life. It's relatively safe, but seems like it's still developing. Not much that's really original. Lots of crap souvenier shops. I did buy one local hand beaded piece of art 

\-The food trucks were ok. I enjoyed the tapas themed one with the shrimp and patatas bravas. The buns are decent quality but the fillings are overly sweet. 

\-The swim up room was worth every penny. We spent every day in our little personal pool area. No thank you for the infinity edge pool that is crowded and hot. 

\-The bus situation is kind of annoying. They pack pretty much everyone going to the airport and from the airport on mega buses which means a lot of waiting around. Contrast with every other Sandals I've been to which does mini vans. Also there is NO Sandals lounge. Just a sign and a counter. You are given some water but no cocktail. Boo.

1hb1zah,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1hb1zah/im_dreading_saying_goodbye_to_the_person_i_fell/,I'm dreading saying goodbye to the person I fell in love with at the airport tomorrow.,"i am wiriting this the day before all this is supposed to happen. A few months ago I met Mia (a international student who just arrived in my home country) on a trip to a lake for an art class I'm taking in university. Usually I'm a very quiet person when it comes to meeting and socialising with new people but from the moment she asked my name, we could not shut up for the rest of the trip. Over the next few weeks we start talking, hanging out and DMing and she becomes a good friend, But throughout all of this she was always this person in my classes I had a crush on but thought I had no chance with, but since we were friends I'd be more than happy with that (cause who doesn't want a new friend?)   
  
After we returned from our mid sem break things continued as usual up until one day after art class, she asked if I wanted to come along with her to help her shop for some things at a home improvement store at the mall across our university. I, without anything to do that evening decided why not and came along. What was initially meant to be a short shopping trip turned into a 4 coffee date where we actually grew closer as friends. For added context, this was when she started to get a bit more touchy feely (she'd hold my hand every now and again, she'd sit shoulder to shoulder to me etc). I started to fall for her abit more, but it was still more of a crush, just a massive one.   
  
Over the next few weeks we start going out on more coffee dates more up until a month ago. I had a sporting event I was competing in that weekend that I was looking forward to. My parents hate what I do and as such have never bothered to come to any of my competitions and as such I was usually the one alone in the dressing room while my other teammates were getting praises and greetings from their loved ones outside. Me, being hopeful offered her a ticket and she jumped at it immediately. As happy as I was, I was worried it was going to be one of those things where she'd only come for me and not care about anything else and eventually get bored. So you can imagine my surprise when after the compeition she came up to my smiling telling me how much fun she had, remembering the names of my teammates, opponents and even the team I play for. My body was aching from an injury that returned mid game and so she and I sat down outside the venue while I tried to recuperate. She, without hesitation massaged my back with a handheld fan pointed at me. It helped a ton.   
  
About an hour after we had takeaway dinner in my car and talked for a couple hours. She told me how much fun she had, how great I was and how she couldn't wait to come to more of my games. I don't what it was. The fact that she actually learned about a field she had otherwise no prior interest in, that she had actually asked me why I took this field up or maybe it was that she made me feel seen for the first time in a very very long time. But regardless, I was officially in love. That night we held hands and relaxed in my car until midnight. Over the next week we started going out to more places as opposed to simple coffee dates. We went to malls, gaming cafes, did more car rides, So I decided to come up with the idea to take her out on a proper date on the first day of christmas break, without any distractions or worry from uni or anything else.   
  
However a day ago from when I'm writing this, she dropped the bombshell that she was going to her home country for a while to settle some things medically and personally. On top of that she was feeling overwhelmed with Uni and was given the option to return home to continue through online classes for the duration of her stay back home. While she'd mentioned she wanted to return home for a bit she said it'd probably be around January, so this came as a surprise to say the least. Today I spent one last full day with her as she gathered up the documents she needed to fly home. I know it's likely she'll come back but she still isn't sure. I'm not putting a single ounce of blame on her or on anyone because there is nobody to blame. She has her (very vaild) reasons to wantin to go back gome, I'm not sure how to put this in any other way than I'm very very bad at goodbyes. I'm meant to send her to the airport tomorrow night and I'm trying my hardest make sure I'm steady emotionally. Our lives our so intertwined with each other so so quickly it'll be a bit hard to go through the rest of this semester without her but I know I have to. I can't bring myself to tell her how much she means to me and I'm honestly unsure if she feels anywhere close to how I feel for her . I think that's the end of this venting thing.

Here's what I learned along the way,"I’m thrilled to announce the release of my first game, **Conradito Cafézito**, on Steam! After **7 months of hard work**, I’ve learned a ton, made some mistakes, and gained invaluable experience. I want to share my journey with you — both to inspire and to spark discussion about game development methods.

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3235270/Conradito\_Cafezito/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3235270/Conradito_Cafezito/)

# About the game

Conradito Cafézito is an **idle incremental game** themed around coffee. Players unlock ingredients, buy recipes, brew coffee, hire employees, and generate passive income with franchises. On top of that, I added several “unique” features to make the game more creative, including:

* **Minigames** to pass the time and earn rewards;
* **Random events** (both good and bad) that occur during gameplay;
* Various systems to boost income and expand operations.

The idea started as a simple classroom experiment, inspired by clicker games like *Cookie Clicker*. Over time, the coffee theme took shape, and the employee mechanics became a key feature. That’s when I decided to fully commit to finishing the project and releasing it as my first official game.

**Lessons learned:**

# 1. My biggest regret: Not creating a full GDD

Ah, the infamous Game Design Document (GDD). I knew it was important, but I resisted making one. What I did have was so basic it barely covered 30% of the game’s content.

As a result, I kept adding new features EVERY DAY — mechanics, systems, menus, upgrades, you name it. This caused countless issues with overlapping systems and forced me to rewrite large parts of the code multiple times.

**Lesson learned:** Having a detailed GDD from the start could’ve reduced my development time from 7 months to just 2–3 months. For my next game, I’ve already written an 82-page GDD (and counting)!

# 2. I delayed creating my Steam page

I didn’t create my Steam page until October, with the launch planned for December. I waited until the game was almost finished to start working on the page and marketing. Big mistake.

Your Steam page should be live as soon as you have basic content and visuals to showcase. The earlier you do this, the more time you have to grow your wishlist and build momentum for launch. Plus, as a first-timer, I spent hours watching tutorials just to figure out how everything worked.

**Lesson learned:** Create your Steam page early in the development process.

# 3. I procrastinated on the save system

I put off implementing the save system, thinking it would be straightforward. Spoiler: it wasn’t. This ended up being the most challenging part of the project.

I had to completely reorganize class structures, variables, and encapsulations to integrate saving and loading properly. Even now, every time I launch the game, I cross my fingers hoping nothing breaks (embarrassing, I know).

**Lesson learned:** Plan and implement the save system from the very beginning.

# 4. I underestimated the importance of localization

This mistake had two parts:

1. I didn’t set up a **localization system early on**. By the time I started translating, the game already had tons of hardcoded text. I ended up using a `strings.xml` file, but I should’ve explored Unity plugins or more efficient methods.
2. I chose a font that didn’t support non-Latin scripts. When I decided to translate the game into Chinese, Japanese, and Russian (huge markets!), I had to deal with the headache of adapting the font.

**Lesson learned:** Plan for localization and font compatibility **from day one**.

# 5. What’s next?

The launch is just the beginning. I’m still learning how to handle post-launch: engaging with the community, creating content updates, and keeping the game relevant over time. Maybe in a few months, I’ll come back to share what I’ve learned about that.

I’ve been a programmer for 10 years, mainly working on apps and web development. Two years ago, I dove into game development. While I’ve made smaller projects to learn, releasing a game commercially was a completely different experience — the level of polish and attention to detail required is on another level.

I hope my experience inspires other developers, and I’d love to hear from anyone who has gone through this process.

**Wishing luck and success to all game devs out there!** 🎮

I mean, very generous. I am so truly grateful for their support. They’re pretty well-off, so I always have trouble getting gifts for them (they have everything they could want), but this year feels particularly hard because I want to show them my appreciation. We’ve already given them a handwritten thank-you note. 

They are both in their late 30s/early 40s with three young children (who were in the wedding - unfortunately we haven’t gotten the professional photos back yet). Previous gifts have included an “exhausted parent basket” with coffee mugs, fancy coffee beans, sleep masks, heating pads, etc.; and a homemade popcorn setup (that my nieces loved).  

My only thought so far is something related to cooking — they mentioned recently that they used to love cooking together, going to cooking classes, etc., but they just don’t have the time for that anymore since they’ve had kids. Willing to spend ~$100 or a little bit more.

1hb1nwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodylanguage/comments/1hb1nwo/staring_and_silence/,staring and silence,"Hi, I need you opinion on this. There is this guy (divorced) that I see sporadically at soccer when I bring my son (I am divorced myself), it is a bit more than a year that he is looking at me, gazing, strongly staring, and it progressed with him smiling at me when we lock eyes and starting to say ""hi"" even if we didn't actually introduce to each other. He has tried some small talk with me over time but we were both always in a hurry. Last year I was not paying that much attention to him (even if I found him very attractive) as I was not feeling ready for any relationship, but it's been a couple of months now that I am smiling back and getting lost in his eyes more and more. I can see him trying to catch my eyes in the crowd and when we find each other we smile and then we remain eyes locked for very long seconds a the time. He seems very introvert and he mostly talks only to his little son at sport drop off and pick up. I decided to add him to social media and he followed me back, but he didn't initiate any conversation. He kept looking at me so I finally asked him for a quick coffee after drop off at soccer field, he accepted and we had a nice chat but really embarrassing.

BODY LANGUAGE: we were both nervous, he asked a lot of questions (that let me intend he had observed me for a while) and I was answering but very nervous and forgot to ask him questions about him, we kept deeply staring at each other. He was seating very up right a bit rigid I must say, legs streched out sideways, his feet were very close to me (he is tall and doesn't fit under the table) torso to the same side of his legs but facing me, he was not leaning in but kept touching his phone and moving it around the table and touched his neck a lot (under the Adam's apple). Sometimes smirking during the moments of silence, but locking eyes for the whole damn time. At the end he kissed me on the cheek and we parted ways. After that he didn't contact me, I tried to set another date but he couldn't. I don't know what to think about all this, I feel like we are very attracted to each other, I know a man can be dense about it but a woman knows this ...what do you think?

1hb1neb,https://i.redd.it/sverbdxpv06e1.jpeg,My review of Grandeur of the Seas 9 night cruise,"TLDR: we wanted a low key, relaxing trip and Grandeur delivered. Great port stops, easy to walk ship with few kids on board. The only big downsides were the massively uncomfortable mattress and two port stops being too short to really enjoy (San Juan and Puerto Plata). By night 9, we were ready to go home but invigorated from a great trip but the ship was perfect for an easy going trip. 

My husband and I both work A LOT. The burn out this year has been real and problematic. We don’t have kids and wanted a relaxing cruise experience with great port stops. We booked a 9 night cruise on Grandeur of the Seas for our very first Royal Caribbean cruise as an anniversary trip and it was booked completely for the port stops, especially Martinique. I read in this extensively prior to our trip about Grandeur but wanted to contribute our experience. 

We are an elder millennial couple and had the very best time on this cruise! It was the low key experience we needed to sooth our end of year exhaustion. We wanted amazing port stops to explore, low key sea days of sun time and reading, and good customer service. The cruise delivered on all counts. 

There were maybe a dozen kids on the entire ship but we hardly saw or heard them, and when we did, they were completely well behaved. Our generation and younger were completely in the minority. The cruise was predominantly senior citizens and retirees and they were a quiet but fun bunch. Admittedly they stayed up later than we did! 

We’re not big on buffets so we mainly ate in the MDR for all meals. The few times we did go to the Windjammer, it was just okay. The food temperatures were inconsistent and often cold. We did book Chops Grille for embarkation day lunch and that was the right call. The Facebook group for our sailing had complaints about Windjammer’s ovens being broken and the lunch being limited to hot dogs for those who boarded first. The MDR service was excellent and our waiters at dinner were so friendly and efficient! We didn’t have high expectations for the food since it’s a cruise, but it was good! I wouldn’t liken it to our favorite restaurants at home since it’s a bit blander than we prefer, but we didn’t expect to be wowed by it. Every day was good but mostly standard fare. My only complaint was at breakfast as the kitchen didn’t make one of the items the way it was stated on the menu. After ordering it three times, I gave up. The beef bourguignon on the Taste of France menu was the best item off the MDR options without a doubt! Chef’s Table was lovely and I enjoyed almost everything. That meal was cooked beautifully and came with very generous pours of wine. 

We could not care less that the ship didn’t have oodles of pools, big shows, slides, rides, etc. The small ship was perfect for us. There was only one main elevator bank so you could never get lost (as we did repeatedly on a larger Carnival ship in the past), and there were always chairs available at the pool and top deck. Yes, the ship looks like it was built and decorated in the 1990s and that is the case, but it was well maintained. The only time we smelt poop in the hallways was outside of the rooms and it was intermittent which leads me to believe it’s because those private bathrooms were being used. 

We sailed at full capacity yet you’d never know it. There were only a few times where the outdoor pool had lots of people at it, but it still didn’t feel crazy busy.

The room temperatures were hard to keep consistent and I would absolutely request a fan next time or bring one from home. The mattress was AWFUL. We both had the toughest time sleeping through the night and woke up with aches daily and would inevitably wind up in the hot tub to help sooth the back pain. Ask for a mattress pad on day one if they’re available. 

Wardrobe-wise, the crew really didn’t care about guest attire - one lady wore a Lululemon bodysuit to dinner on a smart casual night without issue - but the older crowd definitely stuck with the themes and many were dressed up for formal nights. 

We did not get the drink package as we aren’t hardcore drinkers and mostly drink water and iced tea at home. The math didn’t make sense for 4 sea days and 5 port days ($1200 at the lowest price offered for both of us on our sailing) when neither of us ever has more than 2-3 drinks. We brought two bottles of wine for enjoying with dinner, drank at port, and bought the Cafe Select card for lattes and specialty coffees. We spent less than $300 for the week on alcohol and WiFi so it was a great call!

We had no issues with the WiFi on the ship. We only got it two days since our cell service worked at all port stops, and the WiFi was strong enough for us to video call family back home and hotspot the service to one other device for use simultaneously. 

All in all, we would sail Grandeur or a smaller ship in the fleet again. It’s ideal for couples looking for few kids, lots of reading and relaxing, great customer service, and fabulous port stops. ",10,1733837048.0,royalcaribbean,3,1.0,False

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/3235270/Conradito\_Cafezito/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3235270/Conradito_Cafezito/)

Como uma primeira experiência de lançamento de um jogo, aprendi muitas coisas e cometi alguns erros que eu gostaria de compartilhar com vocês com o intuito de servir tanto de inspiração quanto apenas criar uma discussão sobre métodos de desenvolvimento. 

https://preview.redd.it/zqu817hbv06e1.jpg?width=982&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d116c1c9dbb4ce7b3ace39c758dc12128610a5e

# Sobre o jogo

 Conradito Cafézito é um jogo idle e incremental com o tema de cafés. Você desbloqueia ingredientes, compra receitas de café, faz cafés, contrata funcionários, recebe ganhos passivos com filiais e tem todo o conteúdo esperado para um jogo incremental. Ainda, fiz diversos sistemas ""únicos"" com propósito de ter algo criativo no jogo, como minijogos para passar tempo com recompensas, eventos aleatórios bons ou ruins que acontecem durante o jogo e diversos sistemas de gerar mais dinheiro.

O jogo começou como uma brincadeira em sala de aula, desenvolvendo um jogo de cliques, como Cookie Clicker, e depois ganhou corpo com o tema de cafés e logo em seguida já tinha feito as mecânicas de funcionários. Foi nesse momento que decidi começar e termianr este jogo com o propósito de fazer meu primeiro lançamento no mercado de jogos. Com isso, outros diversos problemas e aprendizados vieram com o desenvolvimento, e é sobre isso que quero compartilhar.

# 1. Meu maior arrependimento: não ter feito um GDD

Oh, quem diria, não? Pois é. Sabemos o quão importante é um GDD, e mesmo que eu tenha ouvido falar bastante, eu relutei em fazê-lo. Pra falar a verdade, eu até tenho um GDD, mas ele é tão pequeno que não abrange 30% do que tenho no jogo.

O maior problema aqui, é que TODOS OS DIAS eu adicionava coisas novas no jogo. Mecânicas, sistemas, menus, opções, aprimoramentos, etc. Nada disso estava planejado. Foram dezenas de vezes que um jogo sistema atrapalhava um antigo e o código tinha que ser reescrito. Se eu tivesse um GDD bem planejado de tudo que eu queria que tivesse no jogo desde o começo, o tempo de desenvolvimento teria caído de 7 meses para 2\~3 meses facilmente.

**Lição aprendida:** meu próximo jogo está com 82 páginas de GDD e ainda não chegou ao fim!

# 2. Demorei muito para criar minha página na Steam

Fui criar minha página na Steam apenas em outubro, sendo o lançamento agora em dezembro. Esperei todo meu jogo terminar e ficar pronto para começar a trabalhar na página e mínimamente no marketing do jogo. Me arrependo muito.

A página da Steam deve ser criada assim que você tem suas primeiras imagens e conteúdo base do jogo. Quanto mais tempo de página e mais tempo trabalhando no marketing e com as comunidades, mais tempo você tem para crescer sua lista de desejos e garantir um bom lançamento. Claro que também foi um aprendizado entender a loja da Steam. Como eu nunca havia criado uma página antes, tive que descobrir muitas coisas e passar bastante tempo vendo vídeos de explicação sobre como tudo funciona. 

**Lição aprendida:** criar página na Steam junto do desenvolvimento do jogo, o quanto antes! 

# 3. Esperei o jogo ficar pronto para fazer o sistema de save

Sim, eu fiz isso. Pensei ""ah, quando o jogo ficar pronto eu penso em como fazer o salvamento"". Me arrependo amargamente. Fazer o sistema de save do jogo foi, de longe, o sistema que me deu mais trabalho.

Não é somente sobre como salvar os dados, mas principalmente como resgatar eles depois e trazer para dentro do jogo sem bugar nada. Como eu havia desenvolvido o jogo sem pensar nessa estrutura, depois que o jogo estava pronto eu tive que reorganizar todas as estruturas de classes, variáveis, tipagens e encapsulamentos para conseguir enviar e receber dados do salvamento do jogo. Isso foi terrível e demorou demais. Confesso que até hoje tenho um medinho quando o jogo abre e fico sempre com os dedos cruzados para nada bugar (que vergonha).

**Mas Lição aprendida:** estruturar o jogo desde o início pensando no sistema de salvamento

# 4. Não pensei o suficiente sobre a tradução do jogo 

Dois erros em um. O mesmo erro do save aconteceu aqui: não pensei em um sistema de tradução para o jogo. Depois de pronto, sem pensar sobre como eu iria traduzir os inúmeros textos que já estavam no jogo e no código, fui entender que existem diversos plugins para a Unity e metodos de tradução que eu deveria ter adotado no começo do desenvolvimento, e não no final. No fim das contas, tive que adotar o único sistema que eu sabia, que seria usar o *strings.xml*. Resolveu bem, mas para desenvolvimento de jogos eu ainda acredito que existem outros meios melhores de fazer isso. 

Segundo, desde o começo eu queria fazer a tradução do jogo para o inglês, espanhol, português e francês. Até aqui, tudo bem, são línguas que usam o sistema de escrita com alfabeto latino. Após fazer pesquisas e entender que o mercado oriental é imenso, e após ver as análises de visita da página e ver que grande público é de lá, eu me senti na obrigação de fazer mais traduções, como chinês, japonês e russo. E o óbvio aconteceu: a fonte escolhida para meu jogo não suportava esses sistemas de escrita. Tive muita dor de cabeça para adaptar. 

**Lição aprendida:** pensar no sistema de traduções desde o início no jogo, e também no uso/troca da fonte para outros sistemas de escrita. 

# 5. O que vem depois? 

O Conradito Cafézito lança hoje. Ainda resta uma parte do aprendizado que estou passando, que é ver como funciona o dia do lançamento, a semana pós-lançamento, os meses e os anos seguintes. A forma de tratar a comunidade, criar engajamento e fazer toda a curadoria do jogo ao longo do tempo.

Isso é algo que talvez daqui um tempo eu volte aqui e conte para vocês. Nada que um dev que já tem experiência com lançamento de jogos não possa colaborar! Que tal compartilhar aqui a sua experiência? 

Sou programador há 10 anos e sempre trabalhei com apps e web. Há 2 anos eu mergulhei no desenvolvimento de jogos. Apesar de ter passado mais de um ano e meio desenvolvendo jogos para aprender e brincar, foi tudo muito diferente de criar um jogo para lançamento. O nível detalhes, polimento e dor de cabeça de um lançamento é muito diferente. É uma experiência e um aprendizado único. Trabalhei por muitos anos no mercado de desenvolvimento de softwares e agora mergulhei de vez no mercado de jogos. Espero ter feito a escolha certa. 

Desejo sorte e sucesso a todos os game devs!

1hb1m4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songstuff/comments/1hb1m4h/unleashing_the_chaos_within_how_to_turn_your_soul/,"**""Unleashing the Chaos Within: How to Turn Your Soul into Soundtrack Magic""**","**Songwriting: The Art of Turning Your Soul Into Sound**  

Alright, grab your coffee—or your tea, or whatever fuels your creative chaos—and let’s talk songwriting. Yeah, **that thing where you spill your guts into a piece of paper and somehow set it to music.** Sounds magical (and it is), but it’s also a messy, raw process. So, whether you’re strumming your first chord or you’ve got notebooks full of lyrics that may or may not rhyme, let’s dive in.  

### “But where do I even start?”  
Great question! Here’s the thing: **there’s no one-size-fits-all answer, and that’s the beauty of it.** Some people start with a melody. Others pour out a roomful of lyrics first. Maybe you hear a guitar riff in your head while brushing your teeth at 3 AM. Run with it!  

For starters, think about this:  
- What do you want to say? Like, really say?  
- Who is the “you” in the song—your past self, your future self, or the person you made up after binge-watching 12 hours of Netflix?  
- Embrace this: **even TMI can fit into a song.** When in doubt, overshare.  

### Lyrics: It’s More than Rhyming Love with Above (Seriously)  
Let’s talk words, because yes, they're important. Lyric writing isn’t just about sounding pretty—it’s about getting people to sit in their feelings (whether they want to or not).  
- Use imagery and make ‘em feel it—don’t just say ""I'm sad."" Say, ""the clock ticks loud in an empty room where even the air is heavy."" Boom. Now they’re feeling it.  
- If a lyric makes *you* cringe, chances are... someone else will too. Dig deeper till it feels authentic.  
- And don’t obsess over rhyme schemes. No one said your heart has to break in perfect alignment with an AAAA stanza style.  

Pro-tip: Carry a notebook or use your phone to save random inspirations. That weird phrase Grandma said during dinner? Could totally be verse 2.  

### Music: Emotion in Sound  
Whether you're working with garage band drums, a piano from the ‘80s, or a borrowed ukulele with one string that keeps buzzing—**let your music breathe.**  
- Start simple. A basic 4-chord progression is life-giving. (Looking at you, C-G-Am-F crowd. We see you!)  
- Experiment shamelessly. Key changes? Layered harmonies? Stomp on that distortion pedal? Why not?  
- Forget ""rules"" if they make you feel boxed in. Some of the best songs break the supposed songwriting commandments.  

Here’s a challenge: play your melody all wrong on purpose. You never know when a ""mistake"" might turn into something that slaps.  

### Shout-out to Emotions  
Your emotions are front and center. Angry? Cool—write a song that would blow out speakers. Lonely? Now’s the time for those soul-crushing piano ballads (#Mood). Joyful? Let’s hear that sunshine through your words and melody. And if you straight-up don’t know *what* you’re feeling? Guess what—there’s a song in that too.  

Heck, go listen to your favorite emotional banger and think, “What *exactly* about this hits me so hard? Is it the chord progression? The brutal honesty in the lyrics?” Use it as fuel for your own concoction.  

### Songwriting Isn’t Always Smooth Sailing  
Heads up: there will be days where it feels like your brain forgot how to access words. That’s okay. **Creativity ebbs and flows—it doesn’t mean you suck.** Take breaks, live some life, because, well... life is where half of your songwriting material comes from anyway, right?  

And don’t be afraid to finish stuff, even when it feels *meh*. Not every song has to be a masterpiece. Even your half-baked songs are pieces of your growth.  

### Let It Out, and Don’t Apologize for It  
At the end of the day, remember this: **songwriting is personal.** No one else has your mind, your perspective, or your experiences. Every word and note you put into the world could be exactly what someone else needs to hear—even if that someone is just you.  

So stop second-guessing yourself. Let the nonsense come out. Let the brilliance come out. Write about the mundane moments or the stuff that keeps you up at night.    

Your songs don’t have to be perfect—they just have to *be*. Keep going. Keep experimenting. The music's already in you. Now go make something epic. 🎶",1,1733836930.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False

I’m a 36-year-old woman from Central Europe whose first language is German. I’m here because I’m looking for something real—a meaningful relationship with someone who’s emotionally ready and genuinely interested in building a connection. If we discover we’re not a romantic fit, that’s fine, but let’s be clear: I’m looking for a partner, not just a casual chat or a pen pal.

A little about me:
I’m tall (185 cm / 6’1”), curvy, and have a quick-witted sense of humor. I’m an audiobook lover—especially crime thrillers—and while I may not always guess the murderer, I love the thrill of the mystery. When I’m not solving fictional crimes, you’ll probably find me hiking, knitting with a cup of coffee or tea, or planning my next trip.

Travel is one of my greatest passions. I’m drawn to northern regions and love exploring cities, strolling by the sea, and finding hidden gems along the way. Lying on a beach for 10 days isn’t my idea of fun—I crave adventure and discovery. That said, I also enjoy a cozy night in with good food and great company.

A few things you should know:
	•	I’ve never been married, don’t have kids, and I’m not looking to change that.
	•	Physical appearance isn’t a priority for me. Intelligence, wit, and meaningful conversations matter far more.
	•	I’m looking for someone who can keep up a genuine conversation beyond “What’s your favorite color?” and who’s comfortable connecting regularly.

If this resonates with you, I’d love to hear from you. Please don’t just say “Hi”—share a bit about yourself and let’s see if we click. I’m here for something real, and I hope you are too.

A little follow-up to my last post about my pineapple vinegar project [previous post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fermentation/comments/1gvpj5a/attempt_at_pineapple_vinegar_advice_needed/).

I did transfer the liquid from the bottle shown on the previous post to a crystal container with an open lid and covered it with cheesecloth and within two weeks, the smell turned strongly vinegary. During the transfer I pass it through a fine mesh to remove some of the sediment which was probably yeast? This helped keep it cleaner and free of any white mold or kahm yeast (your guest is as good as mine tbh), which occasionally appeared on the glass but thankfully not in the liquid.

I’m consider whether to filter it again using a coffee filter to remove the remaining sediment. But… a crystal-like gel is now forming on top, and I’m wondering if this be the start of a mother? I was thinking in filter the sediment and reintroduce the crystal gel thing, but I am not sure I will be killing the gel thing by doing this.

[I want to filter this sediment, should I?](https://preview.redd.it/od6ben8xq06e1.jpg?width=3968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f7785053d6870f6d09c56a35757453e20e493b1)

Also, as mentioned in the previous post I have a second fermentation project running at the same time but this version with apples in the same container I used for fermenting the pineapple previously (obviously it was sterilized before starting this apple version). Watching the apples turn into fizzy applesauce was... odd tho, and once fermentation slowed, I strained out the solids (because stirring daily to prevent mold was getting annoying) and transferred the liquid back into the cleaned and sterilized jar again. Now, it smells like super alcoholic beer, way stronger than the pineapple batch to the point it smells like an idk beer with vodka or something, handling it made me emm, I won't say tipsy but it did have a weird effect tbh. Anyone have tips on this one? Pics attached!

## Demystifying the Tech Trio: Shell, Terminal, and CLI

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sjezeomrt06e1.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f94c046ad52c04020fd43d1acd3a4f37d2015e9

&#x200B;

When I first started exploring the world of programming, terms like shell, **terminal**, and CLI felt like a confusing maze. 🤯 I’d open the Command Prompt on my Windows computer, type something, and wonder if I was using the ""terminal"" or the ""shell."" This confusion is common for beginners.

Things got even trickier when I launched PowerShell and noticed it looked like Command Prompt but offered more capabilities. Was it a new program or just an advanced version of the terminal? Understanding these tools can feel overwhelming, especially when similar-sounding terms are used interchangeably.

Adding to the mix, I encountered the AWS CLI while learning cloud computing. I also stumbled upon Cloud Shell. Both seemed related but worked in entirely different ways. For someone new, this might make you wonder: how are all these terms actually connected?

In this article, we’ll break down the differences between these concepts in simple terms. You’ll also learn how to connect the dots with real-world examples to make sense of it all. By the end, you’ll feel more confident navigating this tech landscape! 😊

### Breaking Down Shell, Terminal, and CLI with Real-Life Applications

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/liwi1obst06e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d4d81ad8b54aba965d35123037fbe1095d27b16

&#x200B;

The scripts provided earlier help clarify the differences between a shell, a terminal, and a CLI by using practical examples. The Python script, for instance, uses **os.getenv()** to detect the user's active shell. This highlights the concept of a shell as the environment interpreting and executing commands. Imagine working at a café; the shell is like the barista who understands your order and makes your coffee. Without it, commands like listing files or running programs wouldn’t function efficiently. ☕

In the Bash script, the use of the **$SHELL** variable provides a direct way to identify the active shell, like Bash or Zsh. The terminal, on the other hand, acts as the ""interface"" where you interact with the shell. It’s like the café’s counter where orders are taken—it’s not making the coffee (the shell’s job), but it’s essential for communication. By running a simple \`ls\` command in the terminal, you see its ability to display a directory's contents, emphasizing how it acts as a medium between the user and the system.

When it comes to the CLI, the scripts explore tools like AWS CLI, which is specifically used to interact with AWS services directly from the command line. Think of the CLI as a dedicated service counter for specific tasks at the café—specialized, efficient, and powerful. For instance, the command **aws --version** demonstrates how the CLI helps manage cloud resources, which is crucial for developers working in cloud computing. Without it, tasks like deploying applications would be significantly more complex. 🚀

The combination of error handling with \`try-except\` in Python and \`if command -v\` in Bash ensures that the scripts can handle unexpected scenarios gracefully. For example, if AWS CLI isn’t installed, the script provides a clear message, preventing user frustration. This mirrors real-life scenarios where preparation and flexibility are key, like having alternative plans when your favorite coffee machine breaks down at the café. These examples show how robust scripts not only clarify technical concepts but also make tools more accessible for beginners.

### Expanding the World of Shell, Terminal, and CLI

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sezs0t2ut06e1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ed203ff64f37bc778e687e6fe5048bbfdb3d9fb

&#x200B;

Another critical aspect to understand is how these tools integrate with modern development workflows. The shell, often used in Unix-based systems, supports scripting to automate repetitive tasks. For example, with a Bash shell, you can write scripts to back up files daily or set up a development environment. This is a game-changer for developers who want to focus on problem-solving instead of manual operations. By utilizing shells effectively, you can also chain commands together using operators like **&&** or **|** for maximum efficiency.

On the other hand, the terminal plays a vital role in remote server management. Using terminal emulators like PuTTY or OpenSSH, you can connect to remote systems securely. For instance, when working with cloud platforms like AWS or Azure, developers often use terminals to access cloud instances and execute commands. This highlights the terminal’s importance as a bridge between local systems and remote servers. Remote management wouldn’t be as seamless without terminal capabilities. 🌐

The CLI extends this functionality by offering command-line tools tailored for specific platforms or applications. Tools like Docker CLI enable developers to manage containerized applications efficiently, while Git CLI helps with version control. These specialized interfaces reduce the learning curve for complex tasks by providing structured, easy-to-use commands. For instance, using **git push** or **docker run** simplifies workflows that would otherwise involve multiple steps in a GUI. The CLI is indispensable for both developers and system administrators. 🖥️

It affects not only the aesthetics of your smile but also your general health. A healthy mouth helps prevent issues such as bad breath, gum disease, and tooth decay, and it contributes to a stronger immune system and improved self-confidence. While brushing and flossing form the core of a good oral hygiene routine, oral rinses (also called mouthwashes) can be a powerful tool to further enhance oral health.

In today’s blog, we’ll explore the essential role of oral rinses in your daily routine, the different types of mouthwashes, and the benefits of using the right solution for oral care. By understanding how different solutions work, you can choose the right oral rinse for your specific needs and enjoy a healthier, fresher mouth.

**The Role of Oral Care in Your Overall Health**

Taking care of your teeth and gums is more than just about having a clean mouth or avoiding dental pain. Research has shown that oral health is deeply connected to your overall well-being. For instance, gum disease, caused by bacteria that build up on teeth and gums, has been linked to systemic issues such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Poor oral hygiene can even affect your digestion and lead to digestive problems.

Regular brushing, flossing, and visits to the dentist are essential, but many people often overlook the importance of mouthwash or oral rinses. These solutions serve as a supplemental layer of protection for your mouth. Whether it’s for fighting plaque, freshening breath, or providing a deeper clean, using an oral rinse can boost your oral hygiene routine in various ways.

**Why Choose Oral Rinses?**

While traditional brushing and flossing are key to oral health, there are situations where they might not be enough. An oral rinse is designed to complement your regular oral hygiene routine by helping to:

1. **Reduce Plaque and Bacteria** Plaque is a sticky, colorless film of bacteria that forms on your teeth. If left untreated, it can lead to gum disease and tooth decay. Oral rinses can help reduce plaque buildup and kill bacteria that brushing alone might miss, especially in hard-to-reach areas.
2. **Prevent Gum Disease** Gum disease starts with gingivitis, an inflammation of the gums that can lead to more serious issues if not managed. Regular use of mouthwash can help to prevent gingivitis and other forms of gum disease by reducing inflammation and bacteria.
3. **Fight Bad Breath (Halitosis)** Bad breath can be caused by bacteria, dry mouth, or other factors like certain foods or health conditions. Oral rinses designed specifically for freshening breath can eliminate unpleasant odors and leave your mouth feeling clean and refreshed.
4. **Strengthen Teeth and Enamel** Some mouthwashes contain fluoride, which strengthens the enamel of your teeth and helps to prevent tooth decay. Fluoride is a key ingredient in oral health, as it can help to remineralize enamel and protect against cavities.
5. **Aid in Post-Surgical or Post-Procedure Care** After dental procedures such as tooth extractions or periodontal treatments, mouthwash can help to soothe the gums and mouth. It can also reduce the risk of infection by promoting healing and keeping the mouth clean.

**Different Types of Oral Rinses**

Now that we know how important oral rinses are, let’s explore the different types available and how each works to address various oral health concerns. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to mouthwash, as each type serves a unique purpose. By understanding the different types of oral rinses, you’ll be able to choose the best option for your specific needs.

**1. Antiseptic Mouthwash**

Antiseptic mouthwash is designed to kill bacteria in the mouth. It’s typically formulated with active ingredients like chlorhexidine or alcohol, which work to eliminate harmful microorganisms that contribute to plaque buildup, gum disease, and bad breath. These mouthwashes are effective for treating issues like gingivitis, periodontal disease, and infections. However, they may not be suitable for long-term use due to their alcohol content, which can be drying to the mouth.

**2. Fluoride Mouthwash**

Fluoride mouthwash is primarily used to prevent cavities and strengthen the enamel of teeth. Fluoride has been proven to remineralize tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks from food and drinks. This type of mouthwash is ideal for individuals who are prone to tooth decay or who don’t get enough fluoride from their toothpaste or drinking water. Using fluoride mouthwash can help prevent cavities and promote overall dental health.

**3. Whitening Mouthwash**

Whitening mouthwash is designed to freshen your breath while also helping to whiten your teeth. These mouthwashes typically contain mild bleaching agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, that help to remove surface stains caused by coffee, tea, or smoking. While they can’t replace a professional teeth whitening treatment, they can be a convenient way to maintain a bright smile between visits to the dentist.

**4. Alcohol-Free Mouthwash**

Alcohol-free mouthwash is a gentler alternative to traditional antiseptic mouthwash. These mouthwashes are ideal for individuals with sensitive mouths, dry mouth, or those who are recovering from oral surgeries. Alcohol can sometimes cause a burning sensation or contribute to dry mouth, so alcohol-free options are often preferred by people with these concerns. They still provide effective protection against bacteria and bad breath without the drying effect of alcohol.

**5. Herbal and Natural Mouthwash**

For those seeking a more natural option, herbal mouthwashes made with essential oils like peppermint, tea tree, or eucalyptus can provide a fresh, clean mouth without synthetic chemicals. These mouthwashes often contain antibacterial properties and can be a good alternative for individuals who prefer organic products or those with sensitive gums.

**6. Post-Surgical Mouthwash**

Post-surgical mouthwashes are formulated for individuals recovering from dental procedures like tooth extractions or gum surgery. These mouthwashes often contain soothing ingredients such as salt, chamomile, or aloe vera, which help to reduce irritation and inflammation. They may also have antiseptic properties to prevent infection during the healing process.

**7. Mouthwash for Dry Mouth**

Dry mouth, also known as xerostomia, occurs when there’s insufficient saliva production in the mouth. This can be caused by various factors, including medications, health conditions, or dehydration. Mouthwashes designed specifically for dry mouth help to keep the mouth hydrated and relieve discomfort. These mouthwashes often contain moisturizers and salivary substitutes that help mimic the natural moisture levels in the mouth.

**Solution Used for Oral Care: Choosing the Best Rinse for Your Needs**

Now that we have covered the various types of oral rinses, let’s delve into how to choose the right **solution used for oral care** based on your needs. It’s essential to choose a mouthwash that targets your specific oral health concerns for the best results. Here are some tips for selecting the right oral rinse:

**1. Assess Your Oral Health Needs**

The first step in choosing the right mouthwash is to assess your oral health. If you suffer from gum disease or gingivitis, you may benefit from an antiseptic mouthwash. If you’re prone to cavities, fluoride mouthwash may be a better option. If your goal is simply to freshen your breath, a whitening or alcohol-free mouthwash might be ideal. Identifying your primary concerns will help guide you toward the right product.

**2. Consider the Ingredients**

Different oral rinses contain different active ingredients, and it’s essential to know what’s in the product you’re choosing. If you have sensitive gums or a dry mouth, consider opting for alcohol-free mouthwash. If you’re focused on whitening, look for mouthwashes with hydrogen peroxide. For antibacterial benefits, choose mouthwashes with chlorhexidine or other antiseptic ingredients.

**3. Look for ADA Approval**

When selecting an oral rinse, it’s important to choose a product that has been approved by the American Dental Association (ADA). ADA-approved products have been tested for safety and efficacy and meet the organization’s high standards for dental care. Look for the ADA Seal of Acceptance on the product packaging for peace of mind.

**4. Read User Reviews**

If you’re unsure about which oral rinse to choose, consider reading user reviews or asking your dentist for recommendations. Reviews from other users can provide valuable insight into how well a particular mouthwash works and whether it delivers on its promises. You can also consult with your dentist to ensure you’re selecting a mouthwash that’s best suited to your unique needs.

**How to Use Oral Rinses Effectively**

To get the most out of your mouthwash, it’s important to use it correctly. Follow these tips for effective mouthwash use:

1. **Use After Brushing and Flossing:** The best time to use mouthwash is after you’ve brushed and flossed your teeth. This ensures that the rinse can reach all areas of the mouth and is more effective in killing bacteria and reducing plaque.
2. **Measure the Right Amount:** Follow the instructions on the bottle regarding how much mouthwash to use. Most mouthwashes recommend using about 20 milliliters (4 teaspoons) of product.
3. **Swish Thoroughly:** Swish the mouthwash around your mouth for the recommended amount of time (usually 30 seconds to 1 minute) to ensure it reaches all areas of your mouth, including between your teeth and along the gum line.
4. **Avoid Eating or Drinking Immediately:** After using mouthwash, avoid eating or drinking for at least 30 minutes to allow the active ingredients to work effectively.

**Conclusion**

Oral rinses are a simple yet powerful tool in maintaining optimal oral health. Whether you’re aiming to prevent plaque buildup, strengthen your teeth, fight bad breath, or recover from dental procedures, there’s a mouthwash solution for every need. By understanding the different types of mouthwashes available and choosing the one that best addresses your oral health concerns, you can take your oral care routine to the next level.

Incorporating mouthwash into your daily routine can help you enjoy a cleaner, fresher, and healthier mouth—ultimately contributing to your overall well-being. Remember to use mouthwash as part of a complete oral care routine, which includes regular brushing, flossing, and visits to your dentist. With the right oral rinse and a consistent hygiene routine, you can achieve a smile that lasts a lifetime.",2,1733835840.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False

Long story short I’ve been minimal to no contact with husbands parents for coming up on two years as in my opinion I have to deal with tantrums and the occasional bad behaviour from my own 2 kids I don’t feel the need to try keep up with their adult tantrums when they don’t get their own way or they feel like they should still be able to tell us what to do as they are the parents to us and expect us to live our lives by their rules even now when my husband is 43 they still try to scold him like my 10 year old so as you can imagine it is hard to listen/watch this at times.

When the kids were younger we used to have both sides of the family down to celebrate with coffee and cake and then go out for a nice meal. The in laws seemed to try turn this into a completion with my parents and would come down with an absurd ammount of presents compared to what my parents would bring or at times what we would even buy. It then turned into passing snarky comments at the dinner table to us or my parents and then over the years when the kids were bigger and at school it was like they tried to stay longer than my parents to win some sort of strange title that they stayed the longest. This would mean that over the years I felt like we as our family bubble of 4 got no quality time with the kids on their birthdays or to enjoy the day a little bit just us 4. So last year we decided that we would invite everyone for the usual cake and coffee and then go to dinner just the 4 of us so we sent a message saying as such and they were welcome form 3-6 so after school until we head out for dinner. 

The in laws were outraged that we were cutting them out of the dinner and made a snarky remark of if it’s about my parents not wanting to pay then they would pay for them. When we advised that no it’s a decision we had made they sent a rather rude message saying that as we lived so far away (45 min in a car or a 30min direct train) that 3 hours was not enough and they would not be joining us unless they got invited to dinner. 

We held strong and said the invite was 3-6 and they were welcome then but not to dinner. They proceeded to not come join us for my sons birthday last august and quite frankly we had a better day without them. So decided this would be the new norm. So again same idea of message was sent out to offer for them to come to my daughters last December and similar message was sent back from them that it wasn’t long enough and a dinner invite would be required. I messaged back that that was a shame but I understood and quite frankly it would be a bit akward to explain to one child why they came to one and not the other to which I got back it wouldn’t be akward at all!! 

After the drama last year I would have quite happily have went full no contact as it has been made very clear that they blame me for this joint decision that we made how ever my sons birthday rolled around in august and the message was sent same 3-6 boundary in place and they sent back saying they wouldn’t miss it! Fab I thought they have come to their senses and don’t want to miss out. Well boy was I wrong. They arrived down and from the moment they arrived you could have cut the air with a knife the animosity in the room was evident to everyone in it including the children. (Age 12 at that point in august and about to be 10 next week) so it was apparent they were not in the mood for a party. Mil refused to take her coat off as she would be leaving soon and Fil near enough broke his neck making sure to never make eye contact with me. I grinned and got through it and hubby was mortified at their behaviours but finds it hard to stand up to them as it always ends up in a screaming match or dramatic tears from his mother. I have not seen them or spoken to them since august. 

Well my daughters birthday is this Friday and again as I mentioned before I think it would be unfair for them to come to one birthday and not the other so as much as I didn’t want to invite them I decided I could ignore the behaviour/comments or cold shoulder if it descended again to keep the peace. So usual message was sent out last Monday to which they have read within 5 mins of sending and completely ignored. I asked my hubby about it which he said they would have to seriously think about it and would let us know. Her birthday is 2 days away at this point and tbh I’m over all the unnecessary drama and now thinking I’m not sure I’m up for putting any of us through the performance again if they do show up just to act like spoiled children and potentially ruin what should be a happy occasion. I feel like texting them to say don’t worry we have made the decision for you don’t bother coming down. We have already decided this will be the last year of trying the cake and coffee experience as clearly that doesn’t work with these people either and will be doing individual family celebrations from now on.

I went no contact with him for about 3 months. College started after that so I texted him because I had many of my clothes at his place so I went there to get them.

But in the meantime he wouldn’t talk with me at all not in classes or anything. It was like he didn’t even know me. But he was really friendly when we were at his place. The next week I went there to get my stuff back and we had intercourse. I didn’t think much of it then because it felt just right to do it with him. It made me get my hopes up about the possibility of us getting back together.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become one of the most sought-after cosmetic procedures today. Many individuals desire a bright, beautiful smile, and the transformations associated with teeth whitening can be striking. Understanding the journey of teeth whitening before and after can provide insight into its benefits and effectiveness, allowing you to make an informed decision.

Before diving into the transformation, let’s look at what you can expect from teeth whitening treatments. The process typically involves either in-office procedures or at-home kits. Each option has its unique advantages, depending on your budget, time, and desired results.

### Types of Teeth Whitening Treatments

- **In-Office Treatments:** These are performed by dental professionals and typically use stronger whitening agents. The results are often immediate and can lighten teeth several shades in just one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** These include whitening strips, gels, and trays that you use yourself. Results from at-home kits can take longer to show, ranging from a few days to weeks, but they can be more budget-friendly.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for natural whitening methods, such as baking soda or activated charcoal. While these can lighten teeth slightly, they may not be as effective as professional treatments.

Next, let’s explore the **before and after** effects of teeth whitening. Many individuals report feeling more confident and satisfied with their appearance post-treatment. The visible difference between their original tooth color and the post-whitening results can be quite dramatic.

### Benefits of Teeth Whitening

Many people seek teeth whitening to achieve a whiter smile for various reasons. Here are some key benefits:

- **Boosts Confidence:** A brighter smile can enhance self-esteem. You may find yourself smiling more often and feeling better in social situations.
- **Improves Appearance:** Whiter teeth can make you look younger and healthier. It’s a quick way to enhance your overall attractiveness.
- **Enhances Oral Hygiene:** After whitening, many individuals are more motivated to maintain good oral hygiene practices, like regular brushing and dental check-ups.

However, it’s important to have realistic expectations. Not everyone will achieve the same results, and factors such as the original shade of your teeth and your dental care history can influence the outcome. Seeing photos of actual clients' **teeth whitening before and after** can help you set realistic goals.

### What to Expect: The Transformation

The **before** photos often show stained, yellowed, or dull teeth. Common causes of these discolorations include:

- Age

- Tobacco use
- Poor dental hygiene

After undergoing a whitening treatment, you’ll likely notice significant changes. The **after** photos typically showcase a set of bright, radiant teeth that enhance an individual’s smile. This transformation can lead to compliments from friends and family, further reinforcing your decision to seek treatment.

### Maintaining Your Results

Once you’ve achieved your desired level of whiteness, it’s crucial to maintain your results. Here are some tips to help you keep your smile bright:

- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush twice a day and floss daily to keep stains at bay.
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Limit intake of items like coffee, tea, and wine. If you consume them, rinse your mouth afterward.
- **Regular Dental Cleanings:** Schedule routine visits to keep your teeth clean and healthy.
- **Touch-Up Treatments:** Consider occasional touch-ups with at-home kits to maintain brightness.

The impact of teeth whitening extends beyond aesthetics. It can enhance your confidence, improve your appearance, and motivate you to care for your oral health.

### Over-the-Counter Whitening Products

Over-the-counter (OTC) whitening products are among the most accessible options. They include whitening strips, gels, toothpaste, and rinses. Here’s a breakdown of these methods:

- **Whitening Strips:** These flexible strips are coated with a whitening gel. You apply them directly to your teeth for a designated time. Results typically appear after a few days, but you may need to use them for up to two weeks for the best effect.
- **Whitening Gel:** Usually housed in a tray, this gel is applied directly to your teeth. Some kits need to be worn overnight, while others only require an hour or so.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These contain mild abrasives and chemicals to help remove stains. They work gradually, so they may not yield dramatic changes but are good for maintenance.
- **Whitening Rinses:** Similar to mouthwash, these rinses help reduce surface stains. They can be an easy way to freshen breath while working on whitening your teeth.

### Professional In-Office Treatments

If you’re looking for quicker results, professional in-office treatments might be the perfect fit. Dentists use stronger whitening agents compared to OTC products, delivering faster outcomes. Here are common types:

- **Laser Whitening:** This method involves applying a bleaching agent to your teeth and then using a laser to enhance effectiveness. Results can be seen immediately, often brightening teeth by several shades in just one visit.
- **Zoom Whitening:** Similar to laser whitening, Zoom employs a special light along with a hydrogen peroxide gel. Many patients notice a significant improvement in the whiteness of their teeth after a single appointment.
- **Custom Bleaching Trays:** These trays are custom-fitted to your mouth and are filled with a whitening gel. You wear them at home for a couple of hours each day or overnight, with results usually visible within a few days.

### Natural Whitening Methods

If you prefer a more natural approach, several methods can help whiten your teeth without harsh chemicals:

- **Baking Soda:** This common kitchen item has natural whitening properties. Mixing baking soda with water to form a paste can create a gentle abrasive that removes surface stains.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Used in some dental products, diluted hydrogen peroxide can be an effective natural whitener. However, it should be used sparingly and in appropriate concentrations.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Some people use this vinegar as a natural mouth rinse. It can help to assist in removing stains, though it should be used cautiously due to potential enamel erosion.

### Maintaining Your New Smile

Regardless of the method you choose, maintaining your newly whitened teeth is essential. Here are some tips to keep your smile bright:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Good Oral Hygiene:** Regular brushing and flossing can help prevent staining. Using a whitening toothpaste can help maintain your results.
- **Limit Stain-Causing Foods and Drinks:** Be mindful of coffee, tea, red wine, and dark-colored sauces, which can stain your teeth over time.
- **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Professional cleanings every six months can help maintain whiteness and overall dental health.

Choosing the right teeth whitening method depends on your budget, desired results, and sensitivity levels. Before starting any whitening treatment, especially professional options, consulting with a dental professional is wise to ensure you make the best choice for your dental health. With the right method, you can enjoy a brighter smile and increased confidence in no time!

### Conclusion

A bright, white smile can drastically transform not just your appearance, but also your confidence and self-esteem. The impact of teeth whitening is evident in the before and after transformations that countless individuals have experienced. Whether you opt for professional whitening treatments at a dental office, over-the-counter whitening kits, or natural remedies, each method has its own set of benefits and results. It's essential to choose a method that best suits your lifestyle and dental health needs.

Different teeth whitening methods offer various results, and understanding these can guide your decision-making process. Professional treatments typically yield the fastest and most noticeable results, making them a popular choice for those aiming for immediate effects. Conversely, at-home kits and natural approaches may take longer to show results but can be more budget-friendly and convenient. It’s crucial to weigh these options carefully and consider factors such as sensitivity, cost, and desired outcomes.

As you embark on your teeth whitening journey, keep in mind that everyone’s teeth are unique. What works for one person may not work for another. Therefore, patience and consistency are key.

1hb0wnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1hb0wnd/chiming_in_about_the_aeropress_go_plus/,Chiming in about the Aeropress Go Plus,"I've been using the original Aeropress since 2014 and absolutely love it at home and when traveling. 

My favorite Coffee Mug is the Contigo West Loop which will keep my coffee hot for a very long time. Unfortunately I needed to carry along the funnel (no longer included I hear) which added to the bulk of traveling w/the Aeropress esp. when I have only a carry-on bag for a flight.

The Aeropress Go Plus is on sale for $63.95 USD. The included AeroPress Travel Coffee Tumbler goes  for 39.95 so I was getting the Aeropress (a modified version of the Aeropress Clear) itself for $23.94. That's less than any Aeropress coffee maker right now, even on sale.

Well given I was going to spend $35.00 on a Yeti or Fellows Travel mug anyway, and wouldn't be able to pack it all together, it seemed like a good deal so I went for it.

There's no need in going over the use of the device itself since that's the same as with any Aeropress.

The biggest miss for me is the included Tumbler for which Aeropress says ""Double-wall insulation keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for hours"".

I poured 209F temperature water into both the Contigo Westloop and the AeroPress Travel Coffee Tumbler and in 1 hour the Contigo read 179F and the Aeropress Tumbler 157F. I've brewed two cups so far and the experience is about the same as I measured.

Everyone perceives temperature differently, so what I think is warm coffee some might think is either cold or hot. I get it.

But given the retail sale price of $79.95 of the Aeropress go plus I was expecting something more substantial in the Tumbler. 

There are always trade-offs when buying a ""pre packaged"" system. One component included will not be as good as if you brought it alone.

I do like the convenience of packing the whole kit into a single unit, which is why I made the purchase, and we'll see how that goes on my upcoming holiday flight. I would not however paid full price. ",3,1733834619.0,AeroPress,1,1.0,False

1hb0vps,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hb0vps/are_customised_advertisements_coming/,Are Customised Advertisements Coming? ,"Something that occurred to me today as I sat looking at another AI generated image of a cat.

With it becoming increasingly easy to generate AI images, I was wondering if we could be approaching a point where an image could be generated by advertisers targeting me specifically. 

Or even have the AI text of an adverts language be adjusted on the fly so that it hopes to hit home with me specifically.

Over 90% of Googles billions in revenue is from advertisers, which comes from Googles massive collection of user data, Google maps for where we are, Google pay for what we purchased, Google search for what we like, Google analytics for what we clicked on, Google chrome for what we browsed.

We already know that each of us - going to the same website will see largely different advertisements which are based on our cookies, and so our geography, age - and that adverts must already be being tweaked so that the same product can be pitched to the right demographic.

But imagine using the web and seeing an advert which perhaps has you in the driving seat of a new car; or which has an AI generated image of your favourite movie star drinking a brand of coffee, in the local park of your town.

I havent heard of such uses for AI - and some might say that it would be too expensive for any advertiser to do such thing, but imagine a cheap Google TV with an AI chip in it - You get the cheap Tv because during the ad breaks the AI chip generates bespoke adverts unique to you - If it can be done at a chip level it is probably coming.

Though I love my job, it can get lonely at times. Over time, I’ve drifted from my old friends. They’ve all moved far away or started families and are too busy to talk anymore. I miss having someone to share everyday conversations with. Ideally, I’m hoping to find a future best friend. I realize it’s unlikely to find one on a Reddit sub, but I thought I’d give it a shot anyway.

**A little about me:** I’m an introvert and a homebody who loves animals (I have two cats, but I also love dogs)! I also love coffee, reading, music (hard rock and alternative), TV/movies (sci-fi, fantasy, some horror), and sometimes PC gaming (Civ and MMOs are my favorite) when I can find the time. 

I’m looking for someone who’s also in the U.S. or available during EST daytime hours. A few shared interests would be great for starting conversations. However, I love getting to know people and learning about different perspectives/interests, so it's ok if we don't have a lot in common.  

If you are interested, message me and share a little about yourself instead of just a “Hi.” I’m all about putting effort into the conversation and would appreciate the same in return.",1,1733834137.0,MakeFriendsOver30,1,0.67,False

I don’t drive so I utilize Lyft and uber along with the city bus. Last night after a long grueling day at the lab, i decided to use Lyft because I didn’t feel like riding the bus for an hour. I had to do a bit of grocery shopping before heading home so I walked to a near by store beforehand. I did my thing, sat on a bench outside the store and ordered a ride. 8 mins away, not too bad. About 5 mins pass by and I check the map, the driver is actively moving. But then I noticed he pulled into a parking lot. At first I thought he was cutting through to beat traffic, but then he goes to Tim Hortons. And he stays there for about 15 fkn minutes while I’m outside freezing my ass off waiting for this dude. About 5 mins into me waiting while he’s getting coffee he has the audacity to send me a message on the app saying he’s stuck in traffic like I can’t see the map and see he’s at TH lol and I know it wasn’t some glitch on the app or the map or anything because when I got into his car I could smell and SEE his fresh TH coffee.

**Now we have settled with the basics, lets look into the next one:**

# Making your page not look like trash

* Set your coffee price, or you can set by allowing your supporter

* You can add custom amounts if you want
* Pro tip: Add a good cover image and actually write a decent bio.

# LASTLY, IF VERIFICATION AT STRIPE REQUIRED

Just provide what they need. Use passport when possible.

**IMPORTANT: Don't half-ass the verification stuff. Stripe is pretty strict and if you mess this up, you'll have to start over.**

**Additional Notes:**

1. **Default BMC Payment is in USD,** but you can change the currency at the footer with SGD if you don't want to deal with the currency exchange rate.
2. Minimum withdrawal from **BMC to Stripe->Bank is US$10.**

**Payment fee for the recipient (**[How to calculate charges on your payment? | Knowledge Base | Buy Me a Coffee](https://help.buymeacoffee.com/en/articles/8105744-how-to-calculate-charges-on-your-payment)):

* **Buymeacoffee:** 5% platform fee per transaction for BMC.
* **Stripe Express:** 2.9% + $0.30 per successful transaction. 0.5% fee for payout processing. and +1% for international (outside of the US) transaction or +0.5% for subscription payments.

**Wait. I do not understand with the fees?**

For a $10 payment, here's how the fees would be calculated:

1. Platform Fee (5%):
   * 5% of $10 = $0.50
2. Stripe Payment Processing Fee (2.9% + $0.30):
   * 2.9% of $10 = $0.29
   * Fixed fee = $0.30
   * Total Stripe processing = $0.59
3. Stripe Payout Fee (0.5%):
   * 0.5% of $10 = $0.05

Total fees: $0.50 + $0.59 + $0.05 = $1.14

Therefore:

* Starting amount: $10.00
* Total fees: $1.14
* **Your net earnings: $8.86**

Note: This calculation assumes you're in the US. If you're outside the US, there would be an additional 1% international fee ($0.10), making the total fees $1.24 and your net earnings $8.76.

If this was a subscription payment, there would be an additional 0.5% fee ($0.05) on top of these amounts.

Selling off my game collection to pay for life. I have them listed out by console. I am open to a full buy out. Every single price is OBO, so please make offers if you're interested. Worst case scenario is I say no. Pricing does not intrinsically cover shipping, however if you pick up multiple items I generally either split or take over the shipping cost assuming it makes sense.

I can provide pictures of anything at request.

With the bigger stuff, CE's etc. we can figure out the shipping cost and work out a deal there. Especially for the Death Stranding CE. That bear is going to be...interesting to ship.

Thank you so much for your time.

Here it is, the one chapter I promised to post before the 14th. Honestly, I was a bit surprised that TaE won the poll, but it was quite close.  
I'm sorry if the ending of the chapter feels a bit akward, I was trying to end it somewhere that would give my ficnapper a direction or something to latch to should they choose to ficnapp TaE.

**-Event\_Log\_Subject: Luca Grassi, United Nations, Bored Astronaut**

**-Date \[relevant time unit: Skalgan\]: 9th paw of the 2nd deci of the 1st heard, 78 p.u.**

*This is bullshit. Here I am, on an alien planet surrounded by its inhabitants, stuck on a bed because I broke my legs. Awesome.*

 Sigh

*Well, it could have gone way worse considering what I’ve been through. It’s a miracle that I’ve only broken my legs and nothing else -well, nothing else if I don’t count the micro-fractures I probably have-* and *I can still feel my toes so it’s not like I’ll be left paralyzed. I just have to be patient and wait a month I guess. Assuming some days have already passed while I was out cold, God I hate not being able to know how much time has passed.*

*The only thing that vaguely helps me tell the time are the visits from the doctor, even though they are a bit awkward… I suppose that’s inevitable, with me being completely alien to them and not knowing how to communicate. they seem to act extra careful with every check, like I was made of glass, and always made sure to not leave me alone with… his? hers? ah whatever, the other two aliens, which I assume are either nurses, assistants or junior doctors.* 

*Damn it, I’ve already met four different aliens and I still can’t ask them any of the questions I have! What do they call themselves? Are there any others? Will they like pizza? Wait, can they even eat cheese? Can* I *eat alien cheese?* 

***Gurgle*** 

*Great, now I’m bored* and *hungry.*

While my basic nutrient needs were met thanks to the IVs, that didn’t mean I couldn’t feel hunger. *Especially* if I fed the desire by thinking about pizza. Like a dumbass.

*Well, it’s not like I don’t have anything to eat…* I glanced at the bedside table, where one of the doctor’s assistants left what looked like granola bars packaged in what I thought was plastic, but revealed itself to be either paper or something that felt like paper after further inspection.

I was, admittedly, a bit hesitant to try them out. Questions like “*What if I was allergic to the ingredients? What if it was toxic to Humans?*” and, worst of all, “*What if it tasted French??”* popped into my mind as I valued the pros and cons of eating the foreign food.

*Ah whatever, I’m already in a medical facility, aren’t I? What’s the worst tha-.... Ok, maybe I shouldn’t jinx myself just in case.*

I took one of the bars and carefully unwrapped one side,revealing a whitish combination of grain and seeds, held together by… *something.* It had a faint smell that vaguely reminded me of cinnamon.

*Welp, here goes nothing.*

I took a bite and started chewing.

…

It wasn’t *bad,* but it definitely was unusual. The grains and seeds tasted like, well, grains and seeds, but the stuff that held them together was slightly spicy? And tasted a bit like resin, I  think. Now that I’m savoring it more carefully, I think that there are nuts too? There’s something that reminds me of peanuts and something else that’s kind of airy, like puffed rice.

All in all it was somewhat filling and I could get behind the taste.

*Eh, I guess it’ll do for now.*

I quickly finished the one I was already eating and the others I left on the bedside table before settling back on the bed. With nothing else to do other than stare at the ceiling and wait for someone to enter I decided that it was the perfect moment to take a nap, after all, I was awake for God knows how long and wasn’t able to sleep sooner due to the excitement of my situation. 



**-Event\_Log\_Time: Skipping 2.34h ahead of the last script.**

***FSSShhhhhh***

*Uh ? Wha?*

I was suddenly woken up by the sound of the airlock opening up again and groggily rubbed my eyes to stave off some sleepiness.

*Uff, maybe the nap was a bad idea, I feel even more tired than before… God, I would kill for some coffee right now.*

I looked back at the door to see If it was the doctor again, and was instead surprised to see three aliens, a couple of whom were dragging a cart carrying a crate that was obviously filled with a bunch of stuff, given the rattling sound that it made while passing the bump of the airlock.

*Oh? What’s that ? This doesn’t seem like the other medical checkups…* 

I propped myself up on my elbows, tiredness being replaced with burning curiosity, and tried to take a peek at the content of the crate. I couldn’t really look inside it due to how I was positioned, but I saw something resembling a book poking out of the container.

*This definitely isn’t like the other medical examinations… could it be that they decided I was fine enough to properly start interacting with me?*

My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone whistling repeatedly, kind of like if someone was repeatedly putting a finger to plug the hole of a boiling kettle, except without all the screaming.

The sound was coming from one of the aliens and, with how its tail was wagging, I think it is safe to say that it was a laugh.

*Hmpf so you think it’s funny because I’m eager to do something else other than laying around? Well, I’d like to see you in my place! Wait, this one seems familiar…*

I squinted my eyes to get a better look at the laughing alien, the suits not doing me any favors, and although I wasn’t completely sure of it, I could swear that this was the same alien that came into my room when I first woke up.

*Huh, so they are here again. I wonder what their job is… if they were a doctor they would have been there with the other medical exams, right? Hmm, maybe I’ll find out soon enough.*  
I thought as the aliens stopped at the foot of my bed.

One of those that were carrying the cart walked up to me, allowing me to take a better look at his grayish wool, and twisted its tail until it was pointing back at himself, a commendable feat considering how jittery it was just a second before. Then it spoke.

“Venlil”

Then, the tail was pointed at his colleague, and it spoke again.

“Venlil”

Finally, it was pointed to the familiar one.

 “Venlil”

*OH! LANGUAGE! FINALLY! Ok, ok, let’s see, same word for everyone… it must be the species name, there’s no other obvious answer.*

I tried to repeat the word, to see if I could get the pronunciation right.

“Wentil?”

Hearing me trying to speak their language made them ecstatic, but they immediately helped me correcting myself.

“Venlil”

“Venti?”

“Venlil”

“Vén-lil… Venlil!”

They seemed pleased with my last attempt and started to say something more, too fast for me to catch any of it, but it was probably something along the lines of ‘Yes! that’s it!’.

*Aha! At last, a passable effort! Now it’s my turn!*

I placed a hand on my chest, which caught their attention, and said “Human”

To my surprise, all three of them tried to say it at the same time, making it almost impossible to correct them as they repeated the word to themselves attempting to correct each other. 

They were speaking too quickly and too much for me to hear all of the attempts, but the few I managed to understand weren't that far off: ‘Hooman’, ‘HughMann’ and ‘Youmen’ were the closest.

Then, I heard one of them pronouncing it almost perfectly and snapped my fingers to interrupt them and point it out.

“Bingo! That’s how you say it!” I exclaimed happily.

This, however, seemed to startle them and they all turned to look at me, ears straight up in attention. I was starting to get a little worried that I’d done something taboo when the one I was pointing at tentatively repeated “Human?”

Hearing this I vigorously nodded and said “Yes! Human! You got it!” to pass my point across as best as I could.

They seemed to understand what I was trying to convey and relaxed a little. Then, the one who stated the communications, pointed back at themselves and said “Verim”

Then, while pointing at the one who said ‘Human’ correctly “Leeea”

And finally, the last one “Seva”

*This time they are all different, so it must be names right? They said only one thought, do they not have surnames? Or are the surnames part of the name and I’m just hearing it all as one word? Eh, I’ll figure it out later.*

I decided to skip the whole pronunciation part to speed the process up, as I was getting impatient, and directly told them my name.

\---------------------------------------------  
Lore Snippets!

Somewhere in the Night-side of Skalga's habitable belt there is a valley hidden inbetween hills, where the flora and soil has taken a peculiar shade of red.   
Some of that flora has developed  a bioluminescent glow that attracted the early Venlil who founded the settlemen which was later called ""Red Haven"". Over time the Venlil that settled there gave birth to younglings with a red tint in their wool and that's why some Venlil are red, or so the legend says.   
That valley and it's hills are now called Skalga's crown and they are one of the natural wonder of their planet.   
It's speculated that it was the site of a meteorite impact that carried a bacteria rich with iron.

Need a great dinner after a night of kids activities or practices? Enter Dad’s After Practice Chili!

I made this while my wife took kids to practice. Then, put it in fridge and picked up my daughter. 

Just had to heat it up when we wanted to eat after practice! 

Ingredients:
1. 1 tablespoon oil
2. 2 lbs. lean ground beef
3. 1-2 bags frozen onions & peppers (to your liking)
4. 1 tsp minced garlic
5. 1 28-oz can tomatoes
6. 1/4 to 1/3 cup chili powder
7. 1 tsp salt
8. 2 16-oz cans red kidney beans

Steps:
1. In a large pot over medium-high heat, add oil, cook beef, onions, peppers and garlic. About 10 minutes, stir frequently and make sure meat is no longer pink.
2. Strain the mixture to get rid of excess water and fatty grease.
3. Add tomatoes and their liquid, chili powder, and salt. Then, heat to boiling.
4. Reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 1 hour. Stir off and on.
5. Stir in beans and their liquid, then heat. 
6. Let’s eat! We like to use coffee mugs, adding crackers or cheese.",0,1733833013.0,FamilyMeals,0,0.5,False

I just needed to dump my thoughts out somewhere that wasn't my friends. As much as I love them I don't want to worry them any more than I already do. To anyone who reads this also, take care of yourself, god knows it isn't easy.  
  
I've been struggling quite a lot with what is either a flare or just my condition getting way worse. I don't even know what's wrong, I know its some sort of dysautonomia but my heart rate doesn't seem to peak consistently or dramatically enough to be pots, and I don't have a blood pressure monitor to test for OH. I'm diagnosed with vasovagal syncope and headaches, but the worst thing is the fatigue.  
  
 I can't DO anything, my depression has leapt on the opportunity and I have no interest in doing anything either. I have almost no appetite, which is playing directly into my paranoia that I'm too thin, and I LOVE food, at least I used to. The only things I can bring myself to eat are sweets, which makes me feel like shit because I know it isnt healthy. It doesnt help either that every time I eat I struggle to breathe and or swallow, and after eating I get stomach cramps and nausea. I used to love cooking, but I just have zero energy to do it without sitting down anymore, and I don't have a stool or anything. Internalised ableism isnt helping, and neither is my mum and her not-very-concealed ableism. She's so critical of me all the time and thinks I'm just being weak or something, which is neither here nor there but it certainly isnt very helpful when she keeps telling me I should drink red wine and coffee which I can't drink because it fucks me up so bad. It honestly almost feels like shes embarrassed of me when i talk about my cane.

I keep having to pretend I'm fine and I'm happy when really I've attempted twice this month. I'm just not good enough at anything, not even ending it, probably because i actually dont want to deep down? idk. It doesn't help that everything I used to do for fun and be praised for I either iced out because they weren't related to my future career or I just dropped. Now that I can't even work anymore I feel like I don't know who I am. I feel worthless if I can't work, and now not only am I worthless, but I'm also a burden. All I do is listen to true crime podcasts, doomscroll and online shop for groceries, CDs and second hand clothes since those were my only ""hobbies"" since year 11 when school work got harder. I already knew my work habits werent healthy but as an undiagnosed autistic person making work my whole personality was the only way I could keep up with my classmates, and yet I was never enough and I still borderline failed my exams and missed all my uni offers. It's only through a stroke of luck I ended up at a good university at all and now I'm fucking it up by being sick. At least before it got worse I was only mentally ill, now I'm physically ill too. I miss the person I used to be and everyone says it only gets better but I've been stuck in the cycle for so many years that I just know it'll always get worse again, and it's just so hard to bear.

On top of that I only recently felt like I know who I am, but I've lost that again, I don't know who I am and I feel alienated because of it. Either way if you've read this far, thank you, I hope you're doing ok.",6,1733832717.0,ChronicIllness,1,1.0,False
