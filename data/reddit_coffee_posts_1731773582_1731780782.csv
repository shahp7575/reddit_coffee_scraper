1gst62j,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gst62j/i_cant_wait_to_leave_baltimore/,I can't wait to leave Baltimore!,"After a few long years, today was my last day at Atlantic Shield Insurance. I never minded the slow, dragging days as a broker, but this place had stopped feeling like anywhere I belonged. Each day, I sat at my desk under the gentle drone of noise makers, to fill a noise amid an empty office. My husband’s hours began to stretch, and the brief time we saw each other seemed to shrink more each month. We started living only for the weekends, managing to only keep our heads above water in an ocean of bills needing to be paid. Today is different, though; the clock on my computer said 4PM. I meander my way to the breakroom to gather the donuts I brought in this morning, only a few taken out of the 2 dozen I brought in.

“Hang on!” A voice shouted from behind me. “Let me grab another one of those before ya head out finally.” It was Tom, my boss. Or was my boss. Older, always had some crumbs on his shirt. Usually come to work in a short sleeve dress shirt & tie. Tom Fredrick was the Manager of Atlantic Shield’s Baltimore office, has been for the last 15 years. While he was never the most technical person, he had a specific way with people. Even in his seemingly non-professional appearance, Tom knew how to get things done. And for that, I’d always respect him. Even now, as I give him one last look in the eyes, as his eyes were on the last Boston Crème donut.

“Yeah, definitely! I can’t take this many down on my own even if I wanted to”. I chuckled out. “Actually, here” I motioned up the half empty box towards him.

“Serious?” Tom’s eyes matched mine, with a kind glow. I nodded my head and offered a polite smile to him. He realized something mid chew “Hm!” He finished the bite. “Do you have a second, actually? I’m curious about you and Luke’s move soon.” An inquisitive look came on his face. I took a breath.

“Well, we’re pretty much all packed up now. Gonna start driving on Friday I think; should get there in the evening? Hoping so at least. But I can’t imagine we’ll be unpacked by the time the weekend ends.” I shrugged.

“Heard that, Jean. Take it easy now. So what, no more insurance for you now, or what’s the plan?”

“To be honest, Tom, I think I’ll just stick with it. Luke is really the one who pushed for it, family out there, and just a nice change from Baltimore I guess.” I paused and gave him a cue breath “I appreciate everything, Tom, and for what ASI has done for me too. But I have to get going now.” He reached his hand out to shake mine and mustered a proud, subtly emotional smile.

“Of course, Jean. Please, take care.”

One last gaze at each other before I nodded and turned the other way. It’s emotional, sure, honestly didn’t feel any more special than other days. The same aged blue carpet with various coffee stains, made to match the corporate popcorn ceiling with a few missing tiles. Still waiting on some maintenance, I guess. Luke and I decided to sell my car; we didn’t want to take two vehicles all the way out to Roanoke, and honestly, this old green wagon probably wouldn’t have survived the trip. It had been through a lot.

As I was unlocking my car, I noticed a folded piece of legal paper tucked under the left windshield wiper. It almost disappeared into the midday sun, which added rare warmth to an otherwise chilly November day. I walked around to get a closer look. Nothing unordinary, no company logos or anything. Just a single line handwritten by a pen:

“*I’m going to miss you very much”*

I took the note in my hand, feeling its odd weight, even though it was just a thin sheet of paper. The handwriting—it was only a single line, but each letter was shaky and deliberate. Familiar, almost like I’d seen it somewhere before. I glanced around the parking lot, squinting against the sunlight, my eyes tracing over the empty rows of cars. Besides the moderate traffic of the street next to me, I was alone. *“I’m going to miss you very much.”* I read it again, waiting for a part of it to make sense, to feel like it belonged to someone I knew. But the words sat heavy. Who would write this? A coworker trying to be funny? I can’t remember. Maybe I had a conversation with someone who couldn’t say goodbye.

Today was a long day. And the next few are going to be even longer. It was a coworker. I don’t have time to worry about this. I crumbled the note and put it in the cup holder of my passenger door.

I told Luke I’d stop smoking those cigarettes, but days like this I needed one. My windows were down anyway so how would he even know? My zippo flicked open and displayed a small flame; the butt of a Marlboro rested gently on my lips. I leaned back and placed my hands on my forehead and inhaled. Outside of the cigarette, the drive home was really nothing special. Today was lucky, though as traffic was moderate.

*“You’re listening to 98.6, and that was The Police! Now a bit more nostalgia for you-“*

I turned the radio down as the opening keys of Tears For Fears started playing. My windows, still down, letting the smoke trail out the window as the familiar crackle of the radio filled the car. My shoulders relaxed a little. Just a few more days, I reminded myself, and I’d be done. Roanoke sounded like a distant planet right now. I shook my head, focusing on the road, on the other cars, on anything but the note lying in the cup holder. The cigarette was burning low, and I flicked it out the window, watching it catch the wind. The apartment building we lived in was at least a century old by now; seeing its fair share of tragedy. Today *was* a lucky day, though. Not much traffic, and I found a close parking spot on the street below us. I tuck my cigarette box away, making sure look couldn’t find it, and leave my wagon.

Waltz up the green grated stairs of the building, all the way to floor 4. “Hi, Babe!” I shouted while I entered, dropped my bag by the door and stretched, feeling the weight of the day start to peel off. The apartment smelled faintly of the soap Luke used, and the sound of the shower water echoed through the tiny space. It was familiar, grounding in a way. The shower shut off, and I heard Luke’s footsteps padding across the tile, followed by the creak of the bathroom door. He came into the room, and his towel slung low on his hips, looking as worn out as I felt. But when he smiled at me, I felt a little bit of that exhaustion lift.

“Long day?” he asked, catching me by the waist as I stepped into his arms.

“Way too long,” I mumbled, resting my head against his damp chest. His warmth was comforting.  I closed my eyes, letting the steady beat of his heart settle me. But the stillness was interrupted by a soft chime from my phone, still tucked into my back pocket. I stiffened, but Luke didn’t seem to notice. He pulled away, heading toward the kitchen.

“Want me to heat up dinner?” he asked over his shoulder.

“Yeah, that’d be great,” I watched him turn toward the fridge, and with him focused, I slipped my phone from my back pocket. The screen lit up; I saw an unknown number. My thumb hovered over the message, hesitating for just a second before I tapped it open- but Luke called out for me to sit at the table with him. My brow furrowed, but I brushed it off with a shrug, pocketing my phone and making my way to the kitchen. Luke slid a plate in front of me and grinned. ""Nothing like leftovers, right?""

I laughed, “Absolutely,” taking a seat, letting the comfort of home settle back around me. We chatted about the little things we needed to take care of before Friday, and all of the places we wanted to visit on the way. The last time I was at D.C. was almost 12 years ago, in the 8^(th) grade. We went to Lincoln, Washington Memorials- and the Capitol.

“I know you still smoke sometimes, Babe. I wasn’t born yesterday,”

I swallowed my day-old spaghetti quickly and took a breath- “But I really don’t care that much.” He added. “I know you’re stressed out, and I know this time of year is always tough for you. Just promise you’ll talk to me if you need to?” His eyes, now matching mine. A soft, caring glimpse apart of his expression. I stiffened in my chair and breathed out. The fork in my left hand, started to feel heavy. I clicked my lips.

“I should have told you sooner, Luke. But I promise,” I reached my hand across the plaid table cover, resting my palm on his. “Thank you. We’ll be good come Friday, I know it. How was work for you today?”

Luke’s body language was more open than it just was. He shrugged and prepared the next bite. “Well, if you really wanna know, I worked on some cars, and then a few more cars, and the some more. Sane old. Sorta like a puzzle, but it is what it is. I’ll tell you one thing though, I’m damn glad I don’t gotta work on that Wagon of yours anymore” He chuckled, noodles now hitting his mouth.

“Not cool!” I responded playfully. “That thing’s seen a lot. More than you have probably”

“Alright alright you win, Jean.”

After dinner, we cleaned up together, falling into our usual routine. I washed while Luke dried, and he started cracking jokes to make me laugh, his tired eyes brightening. It was moments like these that made all the changes ahead feel worth it, grounding me in the way only he could.

The evening wore on & we curled up on the couch, flicking through channels and half-watching a rerun of some old sitcom. I barely registered the jokes, my thoughts wandering back to the mess of packing and last-minute details. Eventually, Luke stretched, gave a long yawn, and turned to me, his hand brushing against mine. ""Time for bed?"" he asked, his voice soft. I nodded, feeling the weight of the day settle back over me as I stood up and we headed to the bedroom. I slipped under the covers, listening as Luke clicked off the light and climbed in beside me. He reached for my hand, squeezing it gently in the darkness, a small gesture of comfort before he rolled onto his side and quickly drifted off.

I reached for my phone upon the nightstand, to do some checking and responding. There was another text from the unknown number. This time, my thumb didn’t hover over the message. I clicked it. The first one read:

“*Safe drive home Jean! :)”*

“The fuck?” I mouthed myself. Moving my eyes to the next one.

“*See you soon! Sleep tight, Jeanie.”* A shiver ran down my spine, and I could feel my pulse quicker as I read the words again, hoping I’d misunderstood, but they remained the same. My stomach knotted as I lay back, eyes glued to the ceiling, trying to shake off the unsettling feeling twisting inside me. Beside me, Luke’s breathing slowed, steady and peaceful. I rolled over to face him, watching his chest rise and fall, his hand still resting close to mine. I stayed that way, listening to the silence, letting my eyes slowly close as exhaustion crept in. Soon enough, after what felt like at least an hour, I drifted off.

I blinked awake, disoriented, a chill prickling over my skin. A glance to my right, where the bedstand sat under a clock- it told me it was 3:34 in the morning. I stretch to my left, where Luke was layin-

I gasped. My hand covers my mouth. I reached out, whispering his name, my voice broke the silence. A wave of cold realization washed over me, and instinctively, I pulled back, forcing myself to stay silent. His mouth jarred open, blood dripping from his cheek ran down towards the navy bedsheet. The haunting visual of my dead husband before me. A kitchen knife sticking out of the side of his face. He died peacefully, I know it, he had to. But his mouth, open like that, like he screamed until his lungs collapsed and blood flooded into his throat. I pulled my hand back, instinctively clenching it to my chest, fighting the urge to scream. Every instinct in my body told me to stay quiet, to get up slowly, deliberately, as if making too much noise would shatter whatever fragile calm was left. The bedroom felt like a trap, the air stifling, thick. The now lifeless body adjacent to me in here felt like a stone tomb. I was sitting on the floor in a corner sobbing to myself.

I fumbled for my phone, my fingers cold and clumsy as I pressed in the emergency number, holding the phone to my ear and whispering our address to the dispatcher in the lowest voice I could manage. I managed to stand up, holding myself up against the wall, the weight of the scene before me was almost too much to keep standing. I finally slipped into the hallway, swallowing hard to keep my breath steady. The soft creaks of the apartment seemed amplified in the dark, each step calculated, careful. The thin light filtering from the street outside cast faint shadows across the walls, stretching over the furniture, blurring the familiar shapes of our things.

The apartment was blanketed in shadows, everything cast in eerie, muted tones. In the living room, my gaze landed on the corner chair, and there it was—a figure, sitting in complete stillness. So still, it nearly vanishes in the dark surrounding it. My gaze locked onto it, and dread tightened around my chest like a vice. In the corner, by the worn armchair, it sat. The faint outline of a person, barely discernible, but there. They sat calmly, their body leaning slightly forward, hands resting on their knees. Watching. Waiting.

Everything in me said to scream and run. But I just couldn't. My body refused to obey; and my legs felt like they were cemented to the floor. My phone was still clutched in my hand, but I couldn’t bring myself to make a sound, couldn’t bring myself to call out. The figure didn't move, didn't speak, just sat there, almost as if they were savoring the moment. Like an animal playing with it's food. A chill swept through me, sharper than any cold night. It was like they were waiting for something. For me to make the next move. For me to show that I was still human. That maybe I was still alive. Slowly, I forced myself to inch back toward the hallway, my foot barely lifting from the floor as I crept backward. I could still feel them watching me, could feel their gaze boring into me with a quiet intensity. My heart pounded so loudly I half-expected it to give me away. Even behind the wall I could feel the unbothered daggers it shot me. The unmistakable eyes, the silver cut jaw barely piercing through the dense shadows surrounding it.

But I slipped further into the hallway, just enough to escape its line of sight, yet still close enough to feel the weight of their presence looming from the living room. The dispatcher’s faint voice crackled again, and I pressed the phone to my ear, barely able to force the words from my throat. “Please,” I whispered, my voice trembling, “someone is in my apartment. My husband—he’s…he’s…” I choked on the words, unable to finish. The dispatcher’s voice grew louder, more steady. They promised me help was on the way, urged me to stay on the line, but every second felt endless, stretching into an eternity as I crouched in the shadow of the hallway, my eyes locked on the faint glow of the living room.

And then, as I waited, I heard it—the sound of soft, measured breathing. But it wasn’t coming from me.",1,1731780617.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1gst3xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1gst3xe/brew_help/,Brew help,"I got about 121 grams out of my 30g whole bean blue bottle espresso beans, supposedly dark roast, with 2/3 of boiling water in the brewer and an aero press filter inside. (~15 minute brew on low heat)
The taste in my opinion was dull/bland and had a tang of sourness within it in the after taste. I am yet to cup the beans so that could be the reason behind my opinion on it but it felt more smooth than what I usually expect out of coffee ( I tend to go with Cafe Bustelo Pre Grounded espresso. ) My father found it satisfying and strong and couldn’t differentiate between sour or bitter so enjoyed it thoroughly. 
I may be nitpicking at whether or not I am doing this right but I just expected a stronger taste, the smell was also very sour for what I was expecting.
I used the James Hoffman moka pot technique and turned off the heat at the end once the flow began to rapidly increase and poured my coffee as soon as I possibly could. 

Did I do something wrong or am I nitpicking my coffee too much? Perhaps I’ll grind coarser or use more/less water but I think 30g of coffee will be the best for my 6 cup bialetti

I got these beans from a subscription service: [https://peoplepossession.com/product/las-lajas/](https://peoplepossession.com/product/las-lajas/)

And I opened and used them 2 weeks from their roast date, and on that first day I made 2 cups which were both really cool - the coconut note came through really strongly then gave way to the tequila note on the finish and as it cooled more.

I didn't use the beans then for maybe 1 or 2 days, storing them just in the canister, sealing it with the rubber lid it came with.

I haven't been able to get the same punchiness from the flavours as I did the first day, even with the same recipe, grind size etc and I really don't know what's going wrong. I've since tried different grind sizes, more/less agitation, higher/lower temps. I stopped using them to let them sit for a while longer, but it's been another week and a half and I'm still unable to get that same clarity from the flavours - I'm not really able to pick out any distinct flavours now at all.

I'm using a Kingrinder K6, and those first 2 really good cups were at 75 and 85 clicks, on a plastic V60 with Cafec Abaca filters with water at 95^(o)C.

The only thing I can really think of is since they'd been opened and exposed to more oxygen, will that oxidation have affected the taste that much? Should I invest in an airtight container in future? It's really a night and day difference between the cups I'm brewing with the beans now, compared to when I just opened the coffee",1,1731780324.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

I’ve had a Silvano Evo for about 5 years. It recommends unfiltered water, but I use filtered tap water that goes through a hard water filter.  
  
Recently, the pressure has dropped to about 3 bars, and the steamer has no pressure since last year. I’ve tried cleaning the brew head and flushback multiple times, but it hasn’t helped.  
  
Can I descale it despite having a copper boiler? I usually see people not recommending descaling with copper boilers, but I’d rather use the machine even if it’s degraded.  
  
I’m not sure if there’s a specific espresso machine that I’d want to descale. I won’t buy special water for coffee, so I’m considering keeping the machine & descaling it,  seeing if professional cleaning is reasonable, or buying a new one without a copper component (if even possible).",1,1731780234.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Trying to prioritize one room at a time, starting with the dining room. The first thing I’d like to get is a kitchen table and chairs. The walls are like a beige color I believe the floor is more gray but I’ve had others say they think they’re more tan. I am not opposed to changing the curtains and the rug, but I would like to stick to mostly neutral colors if possible. The curtains that are there currently are dark brown. 

As far as the empty walls go, I was planning on adding a piece of furniture along one of the walls for a record player and speakers. I’ve considered doing some art above the record player along with some shelves to hold records. Not sure what to do with the other big, empty wall, maybe a coffee bar or something.

I’m (F19) worked for the sirens since I was 16 (one year on, one year off, one year on again). I’ve worked at store A for a year now. I recently transferred to store B due to a hostile work environment at store A. 

Details: I was happy at store A due to my relationships with all of my partners, I love my job as a barista, I love making coffees and talking to customers. Overall I have a pretty decent work life. Until early June, a new shift supervisor was transferred to my store to replace another shift supervisor, (let’s call her Dinosaur), at first I was hesitant about dinosaur bc I really loved the other shift supervisor (let’s call him Superman). Dinosaur never liked me since the start, but I’m not one to cause work place drama so I pushed it aside. Dinosaur started showing more aggression towards me as the days go on. Here’s a list below of what she did with time stamp, most of these will be from another pov since they were from other witnesses. 
 
7/16/24
- “I’m switching the play. She’s (op) pissing me off” to barista M (drive thru register) when OP was on cold bar making drinks 

- telling SSV D not to get ice just because Dinosaur wanted YOU to get ice for “not being productive” even tho you were at your position during peak until you switched to solo-ing drive thru (leaving us without ice for like an hr) 

- going to the back to confront you for talking/venting about the situation with another SSV while your are trying to calm yourself down by removing yourself from the situation (I have video evidence)
 
- Saying “You don’t work as hard as others” on the headset with everyone on the floor

- Leaving us on the floor to go on her lunch while we had nothing stocked, nothing prepped. Mid peak


This is one of the biggest incidents 
July 16th, 2024  
- It was just me and Barista M on the floor, (I was making drinks and M was in the drive thru) it was busy in the drive thru and mobile orders were coming through. I finished a delievery drink and it needed to be packaged. The drive thru cleared out, so I asked M if its okay he can pack the delievery since the driver was already there waiting. M said yes and took the drink to pack it, but before he was able to, anothe car pull up to the speaker box. He left the drinks there and took the order while I was still busy with mobiles drinks. Dinosaur came back from the back, and asked why the delievery drink was in drive thru, M explained that he was packing it and Dinosaur said ""No I want OP to pack it, she can step off bar and do it"" 
I looked at her and said ""im sorry but im very backed up with drinks right now so he offered to help"" 
Dinosaur: ""Well it your job to do it so you can get off bar and pack it"" 
M step in: ""I dont have any customers so i wanted to help OP"" 
Dinosaur: ""IDC she can do it"" then bring the drinks over to the delivery station.

I went back to making drinks while M was helping another customer, Dinosaur walk to the back again. M took the drinks back and started rapidly pack it. Dinosaur came out and saw M doing it and yelled across the cafe ""I SAID IT HER JOB"". 

I turned around with disbelief : Im sorry but i had drinks to make, so M wanted to help
DInosaur: ""No you dont have any drinks right now"" 
Me, annoyed by how busy we are and her attitude: ""Why are you being so rude to me?""
Dinosaur was taken it back and said ""This is your job, do you want to leave?""
At this point all the customers in the cafe was staring at the commotion. She said over the headset that I was not doing my job. All of the employees from the back started coming out to see what's going on. Another SSV tried to calm me down because you can see I was about to tear up. 

I asked: ""I dont understadn why you are being so mean to me Dinosaur? What did I evr do to you?""

Dinosaur then said: ""Well you dont work as hard as other people, you dont do what I asked"" 
I took off my headsets and ran to the back crying. 

SSV D ran after me and tried to help me calm down, while Dinosaur went out for a smoke break. Before he talk to me, i started a recording on my phone to capture any unexpected problem. As I was sitting there asking SSV if i did anything wrong, SSV D was aware that I was recording so he stayed professional. As we were speaking, Dinosaur came running towards me and said ""What did you say I was going to do? NOw Im here and you can say it to my face"" 
I was speechless at this point because I was crying uncontrably and just wanted to calm down. 

SSV D said: OP is saying that she think you dont think she work hard enough 
Dinosaur shaking her head agreeing: Yeah she couldve worked harder, 

Everything is blurr to me now because I was very upset, but after this incident, our manager never did anything.
 
7/23/24
- I was showing barista L how to sign in a cash drawer and Dnosaur came up angry at me because I was “pass my time” (3 mins passed my clockout time) and when I reply with “Oh I’m just showing her how to assign” and Dnisoaur said “No you need to leave""
 
- Dinosaur got mad at me for helping her taking an order on DT. But when I was on DT, Barista T took an order when one of the screen was down, I wasn’t able to catch the order when I was helping a customer at the window. I asked Taylor “Hey can you please not do that because we only have one screen” while Barista T got mad at me and Dinosaur just stood there smiling. 

- I was an hour late to work because I oversleep my alarms. Usually I thought the shift would call the barista and Dinosaur did not made the effort to call me, and told Store Manager that I called out when I did not made a phone call about that. She also told the other baristas that she isn’t going to call me because it “not her problem” 

No date
- I ran off one day because I felt sick and needed to throw up. She announced over the headsets “You’re all doing a good job, despite selfish people that leave you guys behind”

- Threatening to send me home because she turned off cold bar, and didn’t tell me where to go, I cleaned and restock my station and was left with nothing else to do 

- Dinosaur has threatned to send me home more than 7 times over me asking ""Is it okay if I do bar instead of drive thru register?"" 

Between these inicidents, I've reached out to our DM and explained my situation. I was ignored for a week, so my coworkers advised me to reached out to HR. I made a report, nothing happened within a week, I got an email saying that the case were clear. When nothing was done. After waiting nearly 3 weeks for a solution, I reached out the DM again and said that I felt like my voice was not heard and I dont really want to go the legal route. Within 20 mins, i got a text saying ""Your voice is heard"" and nothing else. After pestering about the situation again and again, my mental health was deteergrading and I was basically crying everyday after work. It affected my attendance a lot because I can't go to work crying everyday. I also lose some coworkers as friends because they did not like that I keep calling out, which was my own fault. 

After months of dealing with this, there was a situation that made me snapped, I called my manager and said ""I want to trasnfer store"". He said okay and then started the paperwork within a day. I was so happy and felt so free. My last week at store A was like a unicorn pooping rainbows. I felt so happy knowing that everything will be okay from now on. On my last day with Dinosaur, she did it again and threatned to send me home infront my cowrokers and customers. 

It started with Barista M talking to me about the morning crew leaving their messes behind for everyone else to clean, henced why Dinosaur left a note by the drinks rack reminding people to clean after themselves. I agreed with him and went back to work. Another barista overheard our conversation and asked what we were talking about, I said ""Oh M was talking abaout how the morning crew always leaves their trashes for others to clean when there's a note asking them to throw them away"" and Dinosau jumped in and said ""DO you need to leave?""
 
Me and Barista T look at each other confused.
I asked: ""why do you want to send me home?
Dinosaur (helping a custoner at the register tunrned around and said ""because you want to complain"" 
I said ""oh no I was just mentioning how the morning crew leaves their stuff behind even when theres a note asking them to throw them away""
Dinosaur in a mad tone ""Okay then you can leave since you want to complain""
Me confused ""What?"" and went back to work.

Barista T then speaked up and said ""In OP's defense, the morning crew never clean after themselves, so i think it's important you can say something""
Dinosaur went to the back and leaves me and T behind on the floor ourselves. 

It was my last day with Dinosaur so I asked to talk to her to basically clear the air. She then said ""i have nothing to say to you, you can go, you are leaving to another store, I have nothing to say""

I said ""I do :)""

I started recording our conversation. because she oulled in a witness. 

Fast forward. I worked at the new store the first week of November. and I felt so much more happier. I love the customers, the atmosphere, the partners, and jsut happier here.
toward the end of the first week, the new manager (Store manager C) told me that the DM did not approved of my transfer so I am just a borrowed partner for now, which confused me. I pushed it aside bc I thought I will be permanent soon. Roll out to this week, I found out that it was true my tranferring was denied. I was really confused to Why it was denied when I had a valid reason to leave store A. I called manager C and she said that DM said that ""it was a trend for me and Dinosaur to have drama with one another"", which I then explained that it wasnt A trend at all. But manager c said I can still work at her store as long as Manager K allows it (store A manager). I called manager K and asked if we can do that, he then said sternly, ""You work for me so you are on my schedule"". I then asked ""Why was my trasnfer not approved?"" and he said ""Well the DM just denied it"" and I said ""Okay, should I reach out to the DM about this?' and he said ""NO"". Then we hang up. 

I am also leaving out alot of incidents due to the lenght of the post. 

IM sorry for the long post, I wanted to know if there is anything I can do to prevent me from having to leave my job and stay at store B? I've reached out to a lawyer but they are still taking their time with evaluting it. If I talk to the DM, what should I say to convince her? I've also started applying for other jobs just incase I was terminated for refusing to go back to Store A. The coworkers at store B are trying their best to convince the DM to let me stay as well, they also trying to talk to regulars and convince them to talk to the DM to let me stay. I really love my job, I sacrified my mental health at store A, I can't think about going back. I apologize for not being mentally brave and strong, Please give me your honest advice. Thank you!

1gssr05,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkrun/comments/1gssr05/disappointing_first_volunteering_experience/,Disappointing first volunteering experience,"I signed up to volunteer for the first time today and honestly don't feel like it was a good experience. 

I'm new to the area so was hoping it would be a way to get to know a few people. I keep seeing people saying how volunteering is really social and a lot of fun so I guess I had some expectations of this. I'm realistic enough to not think I'm going to be enveloped into a group hug upon arrival and promised an invitation to somebody's wedding but at this sort of thing in the past, I've at least exchanged names with a few people and had a couple of chats and was hoping this would happen and friendships would build over time as I made volunteering a regular thing. 

Instead, I arrived and introduced myself to the ED who at least was friendly, but everyone else was completely uninterested in acknowledging me. I hoped to start a conversation with a couple of people but I couldn't even get anyone to make eye contact with me. The RD looked through me repeatedly which was quite offputting to be honest. She was talking and laughing with the people she knew as they passed by so it wasn't that she is a shy or awkward person which at least I would have understood a bit better.

At the end the ED did say thank you as I handed back the equipment and but no one suggested I join for the group coffee afterwards so again that felt like a bit of a flop.

I guess I'm just a bit disappointed. I have very limited free time at the moment so this was the one 'fun' thing I was getting to do this weekend so I'm reluctant to risk it again when it was so uncomfortable. I'm not expecting a parade in my honour for showing up but surely the RD should at least say hello? The parkrun isn't that big so I don't think she can't have known that it was my first time.

I guess I'm just hoping to hear that this isn't how most parkruns are for volunteers and maybe I should try another event? It's so hard for me to get the time to manage it though that I am reluctant to risk it again if it is going to be uncomfortable and disappointing again! ",2,1731779469.0,parkrun,4,0.67,False

It’s difficult to adjust to having something change the way you do or see ordinary things. Like brushing your teeth. After getting stuck with SORE, I got a lot more conscious about my teeth and mouth. It took some time getting used to the feeling of having something in my throat ready to shoot out like a coiled snake.

Or having breakfast, knowing there was something lurking in my stomach, resenting me – wishing to take the reins. It was still there, but after my run-in with the lady in the blue kaftan, it’s as if I knew for a certain that it wouldn’t kill me. That, and it wouldn’t be an infection risk to others. That didn’t mean it was gone though.

 

Getting back on patrol with Nick, he was the first to notice I was behaving differently. We’d stopped for our bi-weekly gas station hot dog, and I got myself a pre-packaged sushi instead. There was something about less processed, and more raw food, that just made my stomach rumble with delight. Nick made the observation, acknowledged it, and let it go. He trusted me enough to tell him if something was up.

We were having a proper Minnesota summer, meaning rain when you least need it. The DUC had pulled back on their resources, leaving Tomskog PD to focus on setting up a more permanent station. According to Nick, there’d been talks about the Yearwalker getting himself killed or leaving the state, which meant peace and quiet – and the potential for something worse down the line. The whole reason for keeping the Yearwalker from getting killed was strictly because of a devil-you-know kinda deal. Someone else taking up that mantle could mean trouble.

But in our everyday life, Yearwalkers and the DUC were the farthest thing from our minds. Instead we picked up drunk teenagers, stopped speeding cars, or scolded shoplifters. Nick and I were even invited to speak about being in law enforcement at a local school. It surprised me how much Nick changed when he had an audience of kids; he blossomed up there. He was smiling ear to ear, engaging with the audience, and there was a sort of enthusiasm there that I hadn’t seen before.

Asking him about it, he had no idea what I was talking about. He shrugged it off as just getting along well with children.

 

One day, we checked the northwest trail around Frog Lake. It was an on-foot kinda path, so we used it as an excuse to take a longer walk. Nick wasn’t happy about it, but it was better than being cooked alive in a poorly-ventilated patrol vehicle. It was probably the hottest day of the year.

We were coming around the bend where the northern road curved back south. The left-hand side of the road, past the lake, was covered in pine trees. Walking past it, something stirred in me. Just a twitch. I stopped to look around.

Off in the distance, between the trees, I could see a man. He was about 6’5, bald, and dressed from top to bottom in a pitch-black trench coat. It looked so out of place that I couldn’t believe what I was seeing at first. I poked Nick and pointed the man out.

“Yeah, no, that ain’t right,” Nick said. “Should I shoot him?”

“We can’t just shoot people, Nick.”

“Then why the hell do I carry this badge around?”

He took couple of steps forward and whistled to get the man’s attention. There was no reaction. We gave each other a questioning look as we spread out a little, covering two angles.

 

Without turning away from us, the man backed off. Going further into the woods, there was a short section where we couldn’t see him. I hurried forward, yelling at him to stop, but once we got a bit closer he was already gone. But that stirring feeling in my stomach, that was still there. Nick caught up with me.

“We oughta’ tell the sheriff about this one,” Nick huffed. “Guy looked like a pervert.”

“He was something alright,” I agreed. “But I don’t know what.”

“Why are you saying ‘what’ and not ‘who’?”

“I dunno,” I shrugged. “Feels like a ‘what’.”

 

Getting back to our makeshift station at the old fire department building, we went upstairs to have a chat with sheriff Mason. He was already talking to someone, but they weren’t overtly secretive, so we figured it was fine to approach.

The sheriff turned to us with a plastered smile. His guest didn’t make an effort to step away, giving me the impression that this was someone in-the-know. It was a man in his early 50’s. He had a faded blue shirt, a black tie, and black jeans. But I think what stood out to me the most was his pocket protector. People still used those?

“Hank, these are two of my patrolling officers,” the sheriff said.

“Hank Dudley,” said the man, offering a hand to us. “Hatchet Pharmaceuticals.”

“I think I’m wearing socks from you guys,” Nick said with a grin. “Nice to meet you.”

We took turns shaking hands.

“You had something to discuss?” the sheriff asked.

“Yeah, we just wanted to bring something up,” I said. “But, uh…”

“Don’t mind Hank, he’s good people,” the sheriff said. “Let’s hear it.”

 

I told them about our patrol around the lake, and the man with the trench coat. And how he, seemingly, disappeared.

“Just gave me a bad feeling,” I admitted. “I dunno why.”

Hank gave me a curious look, as if making a mental note. The sheriff pondered his options for a bit, leaving the floor open for others to chime in.

“I think I know what that is,” Hank smiled. “And if it is what I think it is, we really need to be on the lookout. Sheriff?”

“Agreed,” sheriff Mason said. “Oughta’ make sure we’re all vigilant. I’ve heard of this thing, but it usually sticks to its home.”

 

As the sheriff walked away, and Nick went to get a coffee, I was left alone with Hank for a bit. He adjusted his tie and square-shaped glasses.

“Miss, what did you feel when you first saw this man?”

“Like a… general worry, I guess. Nothing out of the ordinary.”

“You feel that way a lot?”

“Not really, no.”

He quieted down, giving a once-over to make sure no one was close enough to listen in.

“Did you by any chance know Adam Salinger?”

I was going to deny it, but my reaction had already given away my honest answer. I sort of half-gasped, and turned it into a smile.

“Yeah, Adam,” I nodded. “Didn’t know his last name.”

 

Hank nodded as Nick returned with a coffee. There was something about Hank’s look that just screamed at me to run for the hills. We were law enforcement, yes, but this was one of the Hatchetmen – and in corporate America, people like him make the laws.

“If you see that trench coat man again, I suggest you call it in,” Hank said. “I don’t think it’d be a good idea to confront him.”

“We’ll keep that in mind,” said Nick. “There’s coffee in the break room, if you want.”

I shook my head. That stuff tasted like a tire fire.

 

The sheriff made an official order later. If we saw the strange man again, he was to be taken in for questioning. Patrols were actively encouraged to seek him out, and upon encountering him, call for backup and await further instruction. We were given a couple of recommendations. One was to not be stingy with tasers, and another to not engage even if the suspect looked unconscious. There was also a mention that a strong spearmint spray could be used as a repellant.

Yeah, that last one gave me pause too. Clearly they knew more than they were letting on, but it was useless to push for more. The sheriff was still seen walking around with Hank at his side, and the two of them seemed to have come to some sort of understanding. And they weren’t letting anyone in on their secrets.

 

Over the weeks that followed, there was this sort of cat-and-mouse deal with the trench coat man. Patrols would report seeing him around the high school at night, and there were people calling in saying they’d seen him standing on rooftops. This wasn’t just a one-time thing, it was recurring, and in proximity to ordinary people. But no one had been hurt – yet.

We saw him a couple of times too, but only in the distance. Once when cruising down the highway. It was just in passing, but he was there. When we stopped and doubled back, he was already gone.

Another time was when we came out of a pub downtown. We were taking in a woman for public intox and disorderly conduct when I saw the trench coat man on a roof across the street. As soon as he saw that we’d noticed him, he fled.

But what bothered me the most was my unease. Every time he was near, something stirred in me. A tickle of something unpleasant. And sometimes I’d feel it even when I didn’t see him, as if he was close by – but just out of sight.

 

It was late July when I got a call from Nick. I’d been at home for about two hours, relaxing after work, so I’d already kicked my shoes off and had dinner.

“He’s here,” Nick said.

No hello, no anything. Just that. I sprung out of my couch.

“Right now?” I asked.

“Right now,” he answered. “He’s right outside. I think he’s looking for a way in.”

 

I rushed to my car, grabbing only my gun and tool belt. Nick called down to the station while I rushed over. It was one thing for this stranger to stalk us from a distance, but we weren’t taking chances when it came to home intrusion. If someone had watched us for this long, they knew we were armed and dangerous. If they still wanted to pursue us, something was wrong.

By the time I got to Nick’s, I saw someone circling the right side of the building, peeking through the windows. I slammed my foot on the breaks, put the car in park, and got out with my gun drawn.

“Police, hands on your head!” I screamed. “Get on your knees, now!”

 

I was about 30 feet away, but I got a good eye. That uneasy stir in my stomach was going haywire, and I had to bite down not to have anything escape my throat. The man in the trench coat turned away from me and unfurled his jacket.

Except it wasn’t a jacket. It looked almost organic.

It started to vibrate, like the wings of a cockroach. Seconds later, he was gone – flown off into the night. My brain couldn’t register what’d happened fast enough. I could still hear the buzzing in the distance.

Then, I heard it again – this time from the other side of the building. There were two of them.

 

By the time I got to Nick, they were gone. He had locked himself in the bathroom – the only room without a window. I assured him that they were gone, and Nick got out with this pallid gray color on his face, like he’d seen a ghost.

“Those… those weren’t people,” he wheezed. “That… I don’t know what-“

“Yeah, yeah,” I nodded. “Me neither, Nick.”

“You see the size of that thing?!”

He was still clutching his gun as he ran his fingers over his balding head. I put a hand on his shoulder, getting him to lower the gun. He snapped to attention, turned the safety back on, and holstered it.

“What the hell did they want?” he asked.

I didn’t have an answer. But I could still feel something was wrong, and that couldn’t mean anything good.

 

June had rolled into July at this point. More people were passing through Tomskog on a weekly basis as vacations begun. Tomskog wasn’t the kind of place for people to come visit, but a lot of folks passed through on their way south from St. Cloud. At the very least they stopped for gas.

That meant we were getting more traffic than usual, and with traffic came traffic trouble. Instead of having a couple of stops a week, we went to having a couple of stops per day. We were also getting a lot more calls. People fishing without a license, underage drinking… all kinds of stuff. But through it all, I could see Nick deteriorate. He was clearly worried, and he often told me how he thought he might’ve seen or heard something. Whatever was out there was clearly not leaving him alone.

 

One morning, Nick didn’t show up for work. I was asked to go check on him. Coming to his house, I could see there was a good reason to be worried.

The front door had been broken, and there were smashed windows. I called it in to dispatch and requested another patrol. I approached and called out to him, but I got no answer. The kitchen was a mess. The fridge was wide open and beeping incessantly.

I eventually found Nick curled up in a closet – the one place no one had looked. I thought he was gonna shoot me when I opened those doors, but he kept his cool. I helped him up, feeling a shiver coming down his arm. He leaned back against the wall as he caught his breath and wiped his forehead.

“There’re way more than two,” he said. “Way more.”

 

That day, we were in out in full force. Patrols were knocking on doors, asking people if they’d seen anything. Officers were posted on rooftops. Charlie and Reggie on dispatch were keeping a map of the town at the station, marking the spot of every collective sighting. We were trying to find a pattern – something we could use to get a location.

We ended up with four possible sites to investigate further. The high school, an old scrap yard, a small house by the walking trail, and a house on the outskirts of town. All sites were to be investigated. Nick and I were to check out the lone house outside of town.

We drove out there just after lunch. Nick was still shaken up about the whole thing, but he was handling it well enough. He wasn’t his usual sarcastic self though.

 

It was a two-story house. Abandoned by the looks of it. All the windows were broken, and the paint was peeling off the walls. There was a messy yard with all kinds of scrap and broken tools scattered. A couple of empty planters lined the walkway to the front door. You could see the edge of an old greenhouse in the back yard. It must’ve been abandoned for some time, as the plastic that covered it had been suntanned by now. If you looked close enough, you could see a handful of dry blue sunflowers struggling along the treeline.

“Someone lives here?” I asked.

“Locals think it’s haunted,” Nick said. “And not like… fun haunted. But a people-go-missing kinda haunted.”

“People gone missing out here?”

“Long ago, yeah.”

“Ought to tear it down then.”

“We can’t even fill in potholes. This thing will be here for a century.”

 

We walked around the premises, checking the house from every angle. There was that tingle in my stomach again – a warning. I got the feeling that there was something there. I didn’t know how to tell Nick, so I just asked him to keep his eyes open.

Coming back around the front, I stepped up to the door. There was a strange smell to the place, like a combination of sulfur and ammonia. There were blue footprints on the wooden floor. I stopped to listen – noticing a clicking noise in the distance.

There was a long corridor leading through the house. There was a sharp turn to the right about halfway through the corridor leading into the cellar. There was something moving down there.

 

Walking through the corridor, I suddenly stopped. There was a vibration in my stomach, like something telling me to wait. Seconds later, I heard something.

“…*please leave*.”

It sounded like two people speaking at once in the exact same cadence, but different voices. It was coming from the cellar.

“Are you the owner of the property?” I asked.

“…*no, my mother was*.”

“We are here investigating a reported disturbance.”

“…*this does not concern me*.”

 

Nick pushed past me, knocking his hand on the wall.

“Alright, you need to come out,” he said. “We need to have a conversation.”

“…*I would much rather we did not*.”

“I’m giving you a lawful order,” Nick said. “You are not the owner of the property, you are trespassing. That and refusing a lawful order would be two charges.”

There was a short pause. Nick kept his hand on his taser, just in case.

“…*one moment*.”

 

A couple of seconds passed before we heard footsteps coming up from the cellar. Stepping out was the shape of a towering man. Tall enough to scrape the top of his head against the ceiling. He’d wrapped himself in blankets, showing only part of his feet. He had these strange black leather shoes with three pointed ends. I’d never seen that kind before.

He was absolutely massive. Nick took his hand off the taser, instead touching his handgun.

“Do you have any identification?” Nick asked.

“…*no*.”

“Do you have a name we could run?”

“…*Evan*.”

Nick looked back at me with a raised eyebrow. I shrugged back at him. There was nothing illegal about being a large and strange man, but I couldn’t shake this feeling that there was more to him.

 

As Nick looked around the decrepit kitchen and living room, I was left alone with the large man, Evan. I didn’t want to say anything, but he seemed curious about me.

“…*are you ill*?” he asked.

“Me?”

“…*yes*.”

I didn’t answer him. I just shook my head, waiting for Nick to finish checking the property.

“…*what are you looking for*?”

“A strange man in a trench coat,” I said. “He’s been spotted around this area.”

“…*they are not here*.”

“They?” I asked.

“…*they*,” Evan said. “*They are not strange men*.”

“You seem to know a lot about this.”

“…*yes*.”

 

Nick joined me in the hallway. The large man adjusted his blankets, hiding his strange shoes. He asked us to join him in the living room.

He sat down on an old moldy couch, almost folding himself in half. I’d never seen a man sit like that before. The couch groaned and complained as the springs struggled to support his weight. As he made himself comfortable, Nick decided to address the elephant in the room.

“Why are you wrapped up like that?”

“…*molting*,” Evan said.

“I’m sorry, did you say ‘molting’?” Nick asked. “Is that the word you used?”

“…*yes, officer*.”

Evan let out a hand from his pile of blankets. A thin stick-like arm, black as tar, with four fingers. It could be misconstrued as a strange glove, but it was much too thin for a man of his stature. He asked to borrow a phone, and Nick handed over his. He never told Evan the password, but he still managed to unlock it.

 

A couple of confident taps later, and Evan brought up a map. He pointed to an area next to the highway outside of town.

“…*they are looking for my friend*,” he said. “*They gather here. High ground*.”

“You know how many there are? What they are?”

“…*about a dozen. They are Hiders*.”

“Hiders?”

“…*they are stuck and can not go home. So they hide. And hunt*.”

A long stick-like finger tapped at the screen.

“…*they will leave. My friend is not here*.”

 

We didn’t get a lot more out of him. Evan wandered off back into the cellar, and we didn’t want to push our luck. I was getting chills just being near him, and Nick had been uncharacteristically quiet for some time. The moment the large man retreated downstairs, we got back to our patrol vehicle. Nick was breathing heavily.

“You okay?” I asked.

“It’s… dumb,” he said. “I’m fine.”

“What is it?”

Nick rolled his eyes, pointing back at the old house.

“He smells like ‘em.”

 

Going back to the station, we told the sheriff about the guy we’d met and the conversation we’d had. It seemed to make sense to him, and the rest of the search was called off. Nick was to sleep at the station for now. If these things hunted him for food, or whatever they were doing, there was no safer place to be.

Then we just had to wait, and hope, that they’d leave willingly.

 

A couple of days would pass. During an evening shift, we got a call about a serious car crash. The details were gruesome. One man was not only dead, but decapitated. One child, seemingly unharmed, was to be taken in by the CPS. We only got the information third hand and weren’t the first responders on-site. We could tell it was important though, even the sheriff was up in arms about it. The kid was apparently named Fred.

Patrols were asked to check the nearby area to make sure there was no one else hurt. The road was just covered with woodland in all directions, so if someone else had survived the crash they could be anywhere.

Nick and I checked the adjoining southern roads; old dirt paths leading westward. They were rarely used, but if someone had run south from the crash site, that’s where they’d end up.

 

Driving out there, as the sun was setting, I felt this constant sense of unease. My stomach was flaring up over and over, to the point where I was digging my fingers into the steering wheel. Nick must’ve noticed my white-knuckle driving and turned down the radio.

“What’s up?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” I said. “I just… it feels off.”

“Alright,” he said, adjusting his sunglasses. “Got any idea why?”

“It’s like… it feels like a warning. Like something’s up.”

“I don’t see anything,” Nick said, looking out the window. “But I trust you.”

“You do?”

“I mean, yeah,” he shrugged. “Don’t see a reason not to.”

 

Nick shone a light out the passenger side window as we slowly cruised down the dirt path. Suddenly, he tapped me on the shoulder.

“Stopstopstop!” he said “Right there!”

I stepped on the brakes, and he was out in a second. Putting the car in park, I rushed after him. We jogged a couple of seconds, only to see a man passed out in a ditch. He must’ve taken a tumble down a nearby hill, scratching himself in the underbrush.

Getting a closer look, Nick gasped. It was the younger Digman kid, Perry.

 

He was in his 20’s, but had the face of a teenager. But as we saw him, he might as well have been 50. He looked awful. It was clear he’d been in an accident, and he was bleeding from various cuts and bruises. His breathing was steady, but his shortness of breath told another story. He must’ve collapsed from exhaustion and blood loss.

We did a couple of basic checks. There was no need for CPR, so we figured we’d just call it in. But as soon as Nick put his hand on his radio, I stopped him. It wasn’t a conscious decision, but that second of silence saved us.

“What are you-“

“Listen.”

 

There were movements in the trees around us. Clicking. Buzzing. A strange barking noise, like a large, excited dog – only *wrong* somehow.

“Don’t make a sound,” I whispered. “Not. A sound.”

Nick clicked off his radio. We turned off our flashlights. We looked at the treeline, listening for movement.

Something jumped from one pine tree to another. Something buzzed overhead. Then, something collapsed on top of our patrol vehicle.

 

The thing must’ve weighed over 600 pounds. Over 7 feet tall, this thing was a whirlwind of elongated limbs, tendrils, and exoskeleton. It bent the roof of the patrol vehicle inward as a long arm reached inside. My first thought was that it could smell us.

Another joined it. They literally tore our car apart, flipping it on its side. The passenger seat was tossed across the road like it was a wet paper napkin. With strength like that, they could rip a human arm out of its socket in a heartbeat.

We barely saw them in the dark. In the shadow of the patrol vehicle, they were just silhouettes – like moths crawling on a dying light bulb.

 

With the car demolished, they spread out. The barking noise was some kind of thing they used to smell. I figured it was only a matter of time before they found us, but there was nothing we could do. Running would be useless, these things could fly.

“We can split up,” Nick suggested with a whisper. “Trick ‘em.”

“And leave the kid?” I whispered back.

“Fuck.”

Something brushed against a tree, no more than 20 feet away. A twig snapped.

“I’ve seen these,” Nick whispered. “Back in Juniper. But… smaller.”

I hushed him. He hushed me back.

“Listen,” he said. “They could smell SORE. The thing you got. It’s like fucking catnip.”

“So?”

“So that’s… that’s it,” he said. “We spend time together. I smell like you. So they follow us.”

 

It made sense. I’d lived with Nick during the time we stayed up for 72 hours. If they were drawn to SORE-infected people, they’d tear that place apart looking for him and me. It also explained my regular unease – they’d been spying on my place too. They must’ve noticed that harassing Nick caused me to come out to check on him, allowing them to spy on the both of us at the same time. They were clever.

“So it’s me,” I whispered.

“Probably.”

“You sure?”

“No.”

It was good enough for me.

 

I got out of the ditch and turned on my flashlight. I turned my radio back on, turned off the safety of my handgun, and took aim.

“Dispatch, I found a victim of the single-vehicle collision off 24^(th). We’re on-“

Nick tucked his arms under the unconscious Digman kid, dragging him away. The shadows gathered around me. Leather-like skin reflected off my flashlight as they ducked and weaved to surround me. I took a shot at one of them, causing it to buzz away with enormous force – kicking up a dust cloud, as gravel spattered across the hood of our broken car.

“-a dirt road south, westbound, heading towards the old scrap yard. We require immediate medical assistance and additional units, over!”

Releasing the radio, I spun around. Things in every direction. It felt like trying to push away water while standing in a lake.

 

Something shot out in front of me. A tendril, wrapping itself around my neck, as a pink beak-like mouth opened in front of me like a blossoming flower. Rows of teeth intermingled with black dot-like eyes, with numerous tendril-like tongues eagerly twitching my way.

A claw raked my arm, ripping away my handgun. I gasped as the pain registered, and as I did, white strands shot out of my mouth. They burned the tendril, forcing it to let me go.

I spat at the ground, taking my flashlight in my mouth as I picked up my gun with my left hand. This wasn’t over. Not yet.

 

They clicked, and buzzed, and barked. They were excited. My smell was exhilarating to them. In the distance, I could see Nick leaving the Digman kid on the road, and doubling back to help me. I spat out my flashlight.

“Stay back!” I yelled at Nick. “Go!”

Of course, Nick didn’t listen. He unloaded an entire mag on these things. They were taking some real damage, leaping away from me – but there were just too many. As our ammunition ran dry, the circle closed around me. A couple of them broke away to deal with Nick.

I remember throwing my handgun at them. I wasn’t going down without a fight, no matter how much it hurt.

 

I felt so helpless. Limbs reaching out of the dark to pull me away. A hulking monstrosity looming over my friend Nick, just further down the road. They’d all get what they were looking for, and there was nothing I could do. Predator and prey – the most primal, instinctive fear. The dawning realization that you are outmatched, and that the tools you’ve been given were not meant for fighting, but for fleeing.

A talon grabbed my neck, pushing me to the ground. Scratches against my back, as if trying to understand if my clothes were skin or shell. Barking, as hot air tickled my bleeding arm; they sniffed me.

Something big bent down, and seconds later there was this immense pain coming from the back of my head. It tore out a thumb-sized chunk of my hair; eating it. Savoring it.

 

Then, they stopped. Maybe they just listened, but they stopped. There was a whistling noise, then another click. Movement. Fast movement.

One of them was right in front of me.

In less than a second, it was flung into the air, brought down, and had its head torn from its shoulders.

 

They immediately scattered, but not fast enough. Something large, dressed in what looked like a sun-tanned plastic cover, like a makeshift raincoat, tore through them like a rabid animal. It was like watching a hornet take on a colony of termites. It was fast, brutal, and absolutely visceral. These things screamed like stuck pigs as wings were torn, mandibles broken, thoraxes caved in, and viscera spilled. I saw one of them trying to crawl, only to be cut into two pieces and kicked off the road.

Then, as soon as it’d begun, it stopped. My flashlight had been crushed in the struggle, so I only saw the vague outline of a multi-limbed thing leaning over me. There was a flash of something metallic; perhaps a machete, or a spade. Maybe several.

“…*up*.”

It was a strange, but familiar voice. Evan. I got up, feeling my scalp burn.

“…*get him out*,” Evan said. “*I will hunt*.”

“What the… what the *fuck?!*”

I could barely form a coherent thought. Something wet patted me on the shoulder, leaving a viscera-stained mark.

“…*good luck*.”

 

And with that, he was gone. Every now and then I’d hear screaming out in the wilds, but it was distant and far-between. By the time I joined Nick. The kid was waking up. Nick forced me to sit down and take it easy; reinforcements would be there momentarily. He checked the kid out.

“You know your name?” he asked. “Your date of birth?”

The kid couldn’t focus. His head kept rolling back and forth. It was hard to tell if he was concussed, anemic, or dehydrated. Maybe all three.

“I’m… I’m Perry,” he finally said.

“Alright, good, good, we’re getting somewhere. You know what happened tonight?”

“I’m walking,” he muttered. “I’m… walking all… all year.”

 

It didn’t take long for more patrol vehicles to arrive. EMTs took the kid in. We were expected to debrief with the sheriff, but only Nick was asked to go. I had to stay behind, watching the many flashing lights fill the road. It took four guys to flip our car back, and when they did, it collapsed. Two doors fell off, and one of the wheels. Those things had mangled it beyond recognition.

“I got it from here.”

Hank Dudley was the last person I expected to see there. Hatchet Pharmaceuticals had nothing to do out here, but there he was. He’d put on a white jacket with a blue sunflower logo, and kneeled down in front of me.

“You had a really, really rough night, huh?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I did.”

“I’m gonna have the EMTs check you out, but then you’re coming with me.”

“Excuse me?”

“It’s not a question, miss. It’s what’s gonna happen.”

 

I just looked at him, baffled. He said it so matter-of-factly, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. He gave me a comforting smile.

“Miss, we’ve had your house, phone, car, wallet, and radio bugged for weeks. You don’t think we know what’s going on?”

“You… what?”

“You got a somehow stable SORE infection. You got it from Adam Salinger. That’s very important to us.”

“I’m not working with you. I’m an officer of the law.”

“No, you’re expendable,” Hank said. “And it’s already settled.”

 

He leaned in closer, looking me in the eye. His smile faded.

“You really thought you could hide this from us?” he asked. “Was that your plan?”

“You can’t do shit,” I said.

“Miss, I already have. It’s done. And you’re going away.”

He put a hand on my shoulder, but I shrugged it off. So instead, he grabbed the collar of my shirt.

“I could shoot you and have you dissected,” he continued. “But I much prefer to hear you cry.”

 

I slapped him. Didn’t matter that I was bleeding from my arm, I slapped him anyway. He got up and backed away, laughing at the top of his lungs.

“I’ll give you that one!” he laughed. “Sorry, I got cocky.”

He looked to his sides. Men with white shirts, black ties, and blue sunflower logos.

“Take her in.”

 

I got a black hood wrapped over my head. Zip strips across my wrists. I kicked and squirmed, but it was useless. Somewhere off in the background I could hear Nick screaming frantically at them to let me go, but it was too late. I was dragged off and put into a sound-proof vehicle.

And I’d be gone for a long time.",1,1731779264.0,nosleep,1,0.67,False

Changing you is a fun project to help distract them from how deeply unhappy they are. Finding out who they are, what they truly want out of life, and actively putting in the time, effort, energy, and labor to try and make those goals happen is incredibly difficult. Plus it doesn’t even come with instant gratification. But you know what does? Dictating who you should be. 

You should study xyz in school, your hair looks better in this particular style, don’t like the music you like, like THIS music instead, oh you don’t like coffee? and you prefer tea instead? okay well it’s not my life’s ambition to change your mind. any boundaries will be destroyed. they’ll chip away and try to pressure you to change and give in to what they want you to do and when you finally give in they will feel victorious and like they genuinely won. That’s the goal they have in life: changing and molding you into who they want you to be. You know who does that? Losers. 

There’s no rhyme or reason to it either. one day they want you to have red hair, then next month they’ll hate it and want you to be brunette. They’ll say “you should be a doctor” then next year it’s “but wouldn’t it be better if you were a nurse instead?” They always switch up their goals! Don’t fall for it! And don’t JADE them either! Recognize them for the losers they are

Beware of this personality style because there’s so many conservative men who have this mentality too. They say they want a stay at home wife who’s conservative and yet they purposely prey on—sorry—date women who have completely opposite views?? It’s because they enjoy the challenge of changing you. It’s what they live for. No hobbies, no personal goals, nothing that’s positive or beneficial or kind, just straight up trying to mold people into their own little projects. They’re losers.

### **Scene 1: The Case of the Ex**  
*Salinger Home, Morning, October 10th, 1994*  

The morning chaos of the Salinger household was interrupted by a knock on the door. Charlie, still groggy, opened it to find Rebecca, his ex-girlfriend, standing on the porch. Her face was streaked with tears.  

“Rebecca?” Charlie asked, stunned.  

“I didn’t know where else to go,” she said, her voice breaking. “My marriage is... falling apart. I just need someone to talk to.”  

Charlie let her in, offering her coffee as she explained her troubles. Though he felt for her, part of him couldn’t help but wonder if her presence would stir up old feelings he thought he’d buried.  

---

### **Scene 2: Tom**  
*Next Day, Noon*  

Bailey lingered awkwardly outside Kate’s house, rehearsing what he was going to say. He had been trying to win her back for weeks, but Kate’s new boyfriend, Tom, was infuriatingly... perfect.  

When Tom invited Bailey to join them for a game of pool, Bailey reluctantly agreed. But watching Tom joke effortlessly and treat Kate like a queen only deepened Bailey’s resolve. By the end of the day, he decided he couldn’t give up. Later that night, he confessed his feelings to Kate, and to his surprise, she admitted she still had feelings for him.  

---

### **Scene 3: Julia Needs a Job**  
*Downtown, Evening*  

Julia stood nervously outside a trendy nightclub, smoothing her borrowed dress. She had convinced herself that passing for 21 was the only way to land a job waitressing and earn some independence.  

The manager, a gruff man in his forties, eyed her suspiciously as she handed over a fake ID.  

“Got any experience?” he asked.  

“Plenty,” Julia lied, her heart racing.  

Meanwhile, Claudia, in her own ploy, practiced violin feverishly in her room. The local youth orchestra had a strict age limit, but Claudia planned to pretend she was younger to qualify for the competition.  

---

### **Scene 4: The Doctor is Invited to Dinner**  
*Salinger Home, Evening*  

The smell of spaghetti filled the kitchen as the Salingers prepared for dinner. Claudia and Julia set the table while Bailey kept Owen entertained. The Doctor arrived promptly, bringing a strange dessert he called *jammie dodgers*.  

As the meal progressed, the Doctor charmed the family with stories of places he’d visited. Owen giggled uncontrollably when the Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver to light the candles.  

Midway through dinner, the Doctor casually asked to hold Owen. When he did, his playful demeanor faltered. A distant look crossed his face.  

“What’s wrong?” Charlie asked, noticing the change.  

“I saw something,” the Doctor said cryptically. “Owen... he’s going to do something important for this city in 2020. Something that will ripple across time.”  

The room fell silent.  

“What are you talking about?” Bailey asked.  

The Doctor hesitated, then sighed. “You won’t believe me, but I’m not exactly... human.”  

Charlie raised an eyebrow. “You look human to me.”  

In response, the Doctor grabbed Charlie’s hand and pressed it to his chest—directly over his two beating hearts. Charlie’s eyes widened, and the room erupted in disbelief.  

---

### **Scene 5: The Fallout**  
*Later That Night*  

The family was still reeling from the Doctor’s revelation. Julia paced the living room. “He’s crazy, right? Two hearts? An alien?!”  

“Feels pretty real to me,” Charlie said, rubbing his hand absentmindedly.  

Bailey, skeptical but intrigued, asked, “If you’re an alien, where’s your spaceship?”  

The Doctor gave a small smile. “Let’s just say it’s parked somewhere safe.”  

The discussion continued late into the night, oscillating between disbelief, fascination, and laughter.  

---

### **Scene 6: Rebecca’s Decision**  
*Rebecca’s Apartment, Next Morning*  

Rebecca called Charlie, thanking him for being there for her. “I needed someone to remind me that I deserve better,” she said. “I’m leaving him, Charlie. For good this time.”  

Charlie felt a pang of guilt. He had harbored a fleeting hope that Rebecca’s visit might mean something more, but her resolve reminded him of their past and why they didn’t work.  

---

### **Scene 7: Bailey and Kate**  
*Park, Afternoon*  

Bailey and Kate met for a walk, the tension between them palpable.  

“Why now?” Kate asked. “Why couldn’t you say all this before I moved on?”  

“I didn’t realize what I had until it was gone,” Bailey admitted. “But I’m here now, and I want to fight for us.”  

Kate hesitated, then took his hand. “Let’s see where this goes.”  

---

### **Scene 8: Julia’s Reality Check**  
*Nightclub, Evening*  

Julia’s first night waitressing was a disaster. The manager quickly realized she had no experience and was far too young for the role.  

“You’re fired,” he said bluntly, handing her back her fake ID.  

Humiliated, Julia trudged home. Claudia, overhearing her sister’s complaints, quietly placed her violin back in its case. “We all have to grow up sometime,” she murmured.  

---

### **Scene 9: The Doctor’s Warning**  
*Salinger Home, Midnight*  

As the family settled down, the Doctor lingered with Charlie in the kitchen.  

“You’re the glue, you know,” the Doctor said.  

“What?”  

“This family. They’ll look to you. Don’t let them down.”  

Charlie frowned. “Why tell me this?”  

“Because time is fragile,” the Doctor said, his tone uncharacteristically somber. “And so is family.”  

---

### **Scene 10: Halloween Plans**  
*Salinger Home, Morning, October 12th*  

The family gathered around the table, planning their costumes for the upcoming Halloween party. The Doctor promised to come, claiming he had a costume that would “outshine them all.”  

For the first time in a long time, the Salingers felt like a real family again—laughing, arguing, and making memories.  

In the corner, Owen giggled in his high chair, unaware of the destiny the Doctor had glimpsed.  

**Plot Device:** *The Doctor’s Vision of Owen’s Future.*  
This foreshadowing connects the family’s present struggles with a pivotal moment in San Francisco’s future, tying the Doctor’s involvement to their story in a subtle but meaningful way.  ",1,1731778991.0,TheWritersHaven,0,1.0,False

Looking for some help picking a Christmas present for my wife. I'm not a huge coffee person so I'm kinda clueless. 

  
Currently she has a fairly basic espresso machine from wal-mart and is using pre-ground. The machine is beginning to fail (leaking water). Even with a fairly basic machine she has saved us a ton of money making her coffee at home this year (she drinks lattes). Also she is nice enough to make me a great tasting mocha upon request. So she deserves machine upgrade!

  
I want something that is user friendly, but not something so basic that she will be held back if/when she becomes more advanced. I'm currently looking at the Breville Barista Touch. It seems user friendly and customizable. I'm also open to purchasing seperate grinders/machines rather than combo units. I would like to stay under 1000 dollars total for everything.

  
Bonus points for a coffee-making guidebook to give her along with. Thanks in advance for all your help!

What others? Sure his 115th Dream, but I don’t feel imho like it has that punch. I feel like a song like Ring Them Bells is very poetic and has that punch. 

What others songs though? I wanted to make a short playlist of my own that is just banger after banger and could be referenced to convert more people into fans.

Thus far, I have failed. Literally just a few minutes ago I drank a cup of coffee and ate some cookies.

Okay... this isn't working how I want. I've tried everything-- read various books, seen various documentaries, seen undercover footage, seen interviews from factory farm workers, etc.

I always end up in a cycle: I'm pepped towards veganism, am fine for maybe a week or two, then end up eating something with dairy or eggs in it. Repeat every month.

I've tried cold turkey. I've tried slowly transitioning from vegetarian to vegan. Nothing works.

I also struggle with staying vegan 100% instead of eating in moderation. 

For example:

- If given an option to eat a piece of pizza or cake at a party, I'll usually give in. It's only one piece, right? 
- I want some cereal and am out of oat milk. There's dairy milk from my roommate though. I'll just drink that. I mean, we *already* bought it.
- I'm at a coffee shop with a few spare dollars in my pocket. Non-dairy milk costs a dollar extra, so I opt for regular coffee instead to save money/be able to pay for my drink.

I feel like one of the issues is that I don't *care* enough. In my head, I want to be vegan for moral and health reasons, but my morals aren't strong enough to outweigh my convenience, hunger, or my health.

I've seen vegans say that apathy is an issue most non-vegans deal with. It's a hurdle to get people to just stop *not* caring... is it possible to teach yourself to care?

I'm not the biggest animal person. I'm petfree and not super interested in actually *interacting* with animals. I adore reading about them and researching them, but I can't say I care to actually meet them. I don't want to have a dog near me, cringe even seeing outside cats, don't feel much when I see wild animals...

The original post was about a younger, very attractive man at work giving me extra attention. It started as just flattering the first 9 months of working together. But last month I was having a hard time with an account and took a minute to collect myself before going back to the convo. In 1/100000 chances I walk out of my office and run into him (we don’t work together he’s a vendor that’s there once a week different times and days). He sees me looking upset and immediately comes pretty close and asks if I’m okay and just like tells me I’m amazing and I shouldn’t let anyone upset me type of things I can’t remember the exact words it was like a 1 minute interaction that honestly shocked me. I didn’t even know how to respond we just like locked eyes for 5 seconds and I said thanks and had to get back to it and walk back in my office. 

That like moment there at the end of staring at each other gave me feels j haven’t felt in a decade so I have made it a point to distance myself. I am married with kids. Since then he has seen much more interested, nothing overt no like I got you coffee or even really chatting we don’t have each others numbers it’s nothing. But when we see each other I catch him staring at me like either lovingly or like eye fucking me. The ways my husband used to..

I came here to vent and see what advice came. Three people said so you have a crush and you need to redirect that energy to your husband. So I’ve started doing that and he is totally not into it.

We have a healthy sex life. When he’s horny he shows his interest and that’s a few times a week. I’m a high libido person who can (if I feel well) always be persuaded into it if I’m not initially in the mood. But outside of him wanting sex it’s very limited affection. He says it’s stress and lack of time. So I’ve been trying to lighten his load (ex: he washes the toddler cups  for the next day after dinner and I’ve been doing it while dinners cooking for him, taking trash out!) And going out of my way to “make time”. But when that time comes he’s just not into me. 

He doesn’t want to kiss me more than a peck to get me out of his face. He doesn’t want to, not even “cuddle” but like let me curl up next to him on the couch. Today he called me an annoying puppy dog and said he’s just not into it. I tried to be playful in response saying something like “I’m just a lonely MILF wanting attention” like I put my hand to my head like I was swooning like a joke. And he scoffed and said milf like in an as if type of way and left the room. 

So I’m feeling incredibly hurt.. and I feel like I can’t even tell him the truth of it all. Because the truth is that another man is giving me attention that makes my heart pound by just looking up and seeing him staring. I could’ve thrown up the day he touched my arm, when I walked back in my office. The butterflies were insane. The man’s carved by the Gods, very successful and if I was a cheater I’d be leaning into it instead of redditing the frustration of it all",0,1731778454.0,Marriage,4,0.5,False

They've met at work, but as of right now, they work in completely different parts of town. When they worked together, Ryan used to buy coffee for her (completely fine). Sarah works a different schedule and in a different part of town, and now Ryan likes to drive all the way to her new area and deliver her coffee. He's mentioned how he doesn't really respect relationships (to put it exactly, he said he would be willing to help another girl cheat on her girlfriend). Ryan a few days ago joked if he could teach me and Sarah's hypothetical kid racial slurs (we both are minorities).

  


Sara and Ryan (to my knowledge) stopped talking to each other for those few days. At work, Ryan and Sara briefly saw each other and Ryan communicated how he is not feeling well mentally.

And it’s not just vacations and food. People are flexing everything—expensive phones, designer clothes, even workouts at the gym! And half the time, it’s just for the sake of getting attention. I mean, how many times do we need to see the same “just bought this” or “look at my life” posts?

It’s not even about connecting anymore; it’s just become this platform for showing off. And the worst part? It feels like people are doing it just to make others feel bad, like if you’re not out there living the ‘perfect’ life, you’re somehow falling behind. Meanwhile, most of us are just trying to survive exams and maybe have enough for a weekend hangout without going broke.

Can we get back to using social media to actually connect, share stuff that matters, or just be real? The flex culture is out of control, and it’s honestly draining.

""I'm sorry, you want me to what?"" Johannes asked. He was sitting on his favorite couch with a few books beside him. On the other side of the ornate marble coffee table, sitting on a matching couch, was Susano'o. He had a ceramic cup in front of him on the coffee table, steaming green liquid filling the air with a soothing aroma.

""I want you to fight my student, Futsunushi. Don't worry about how it'll happen on my side; I'll make it happen. Originally, I volunteered myself alongside my two students, hoping opponents would be selected that would worthwhile challenges. Once I saw the Rosters, I knew you would be perfect for Futsunushi. My ideal battle will…have to come later."" Susano'o said.

Reginleif floated behind Susano'o's couch, placing books back onto shelves through her powers. Occasionally, she would look out the corner of her eyes at the two. ""No."" Johannes said. ""I've had enough wannabe teachers send wannabe students to learn under me or fight me only to try and steal my teachings.""

""You misunderstand."" Susano'o said. ""I have learned from you everything I ever wanted.""

A murderous aura began emanating from Johannes. Reginleif dropped her books in shock, and Susano'o's eyes widened. ""*You stole my teachings?""*

""No! No!"" Susano'o said smiling nervously, placing his open hands in front of himself as if bracing against the air. ""I was enamored with it, but was never allowed to interact with you or any human during my exile. I could only observe in secret due to my sister's decree."" Susano'o placed his hands on his thighs and bowed deeply. ""I am sincerely sorry, Meister. In my enthusiasm, I failed to respect your wishes and learned from you without your blessing.""

The aura shrunk before vanishing. Johannes sighed. ""It's frustrating, and I don't understand the situation with your sister, but I won't hold it against you. But you misunderstand, I am not here to fight for personal glory. The Gods are threatening humanity; if they win, humanity dies…and swordsmanship with them.""

Susano'o raised his head and locked eyes with Johannes. ""I know. As much as I hate it, I know. My exile took my vote away, and I could have done more to inspire love for humans among my people, but my love for swordsmanship and its creators…was deemed a corrupting influence that clouded my judgment."" Susano'o reached for and picked up his tea cup, taking a quick sip. ""Who made this?""

""Reginleif did. Contrary to her stoic persona, she's rather sensitive and puts a lot of effort into things like that."" A book flew past Susano'o and towards Johannes' face. Johannes' hand snapped into the air, catching the book well before it reached his face.

""It's delicious, Reginleif! Thank you!"" Reginleif turned away, hiding her slight blushing. ""Anyways, back to Futsunushi. I don't want you to fight him intending to lose. I want you to put your all into killing him.""

Johannes squinted at Susano'o, then looked down and sighed. He reached down for his tea, staring quietly at his reflection. ""He's stagnated, hasn't he?"" He asked. He took a small, quiet sip.

""Both of them have. My disciples are just at the point before mastery. They're dedicated to it, obsessed with it even…but they're scared of what they must do to reach it and what comes after.""

""What a frustrating point.""

""Yes. I will not deny it; I am being extremely selfish. Always have been. My selfishness cost me my voice in the council, and now it wants to pit Futsunushi and Takemikazuchi against you and another of the…Einherjar?""

""That's what Brunhilde calls us, yes. Must admit it fills my heart with a little pride."" Johannes said smiling softly.

""Meister Lichtenauer, I want swordsmanship to survive. If you win, Humanity is one step closer to survival. If he wins, Futsunushi will finally claim mastery and we three will preserve swordsmanship for the ones who will come after Humanity."" Susano'o leaned closer to Johannes. ""Swordsmanship will never die.""

Johannes leaned back into the couch. ""You really are selfish, but…that's not always a bad thing. If it happens, I will fight your student. However, there's one possibility you didn't think of.""

""What is it?""

""What if I win, but Humanity loses?""

Susano'o beamed. ""I'm too optimistic to believe that will happen! Swordsmanship was born from Humanity's will to stand up against stronger foes. That will…shall carry Humanity to victory.""

*Ha! Susano'o, you brat! You failed to tell me how stubborn this one is!* Johannes thought.

Futsunushi drew his sword and lowered it to his right side. In his left, he flipped his scabbard to point the end up. ""*Futsu-ryū Third Kata; Warm and Cool.""* Futsunushi said. Futsunushi dashed towards Johannes. Johannes returned to the Alber stance, waiting to counter. Futsunushi reached his range quicker this time, but Johannes anticipated it; his position at the top of the porch gave a him higher-ground over his opponent. Futsunushi would have to overcome the disadvantage to make his new technique meaningful.

Johannes raised his langes schwert straight up to Futsunushi's chin again, but he stopped just before he ran into the blade's trajectory. His abdomen open, Futsunushi fired a quick stab at it. Johannes quickly pivoted to the left, catching the stab on his sword's strong and redirecting his past him. As he began to turn back to face Futsunushi, the hair on his neck stood up. Through pure instinct, Johannes ducked at rolled to Futsunushi's left. He felt the displaced air of Futsunushi's left swing barely miss the back of his skull. Now positioned at Futsunushi's left, Johannes stepped forward with his left foot and aimed stab straight at Futsunushi's left eye. Futsunushi twisted to the left, catching Johannes's blade and diverting it past the left side of his head. Within that same twist, Futsunushi performed a compact slash with his katana aimed at Johannes' torso. Johannes kicked off with left foot and jumped away, the cut missing his stomach. He managed to land back in his stance and waited for his opponent. Futsunushi went back into his stance. The distance between the two smaller than the start of previous exchanges. The two took stock of the others injuries; Futsunushi's bruised and bloodied forehead, bruised philtrum, ribs, right shoulder, and chin; Johannes' heavily battered torso.

It was then that something caught Futsunushi's eye. On Johannes' left sleeve, a tear caused by an earlier blow appeared, clinging to his arm. What surprised him was not the cut itself, but Johannes' bicep under it. ""Wait a minute!"" Futsunushi said. ""Explain that!"" He pointed to the tear.

""Explain what?"" Johannes asked. ""Besides, it's rude to point.""

""Don't change the subject. Explain that.""

""I have no idea what you're talking about."" Johannes said smiling.

""You're jacked under that fancy shirt, aren't you?"" Johannes said nothing, trying to hold back a sly smile. ""All that 'feeble old man' crap from earlier was a trick! You've been holding back, too!"" Futsunushi's temper began to rise.

""Sorry Futsunushi, but you're wrong. Behold!"" Johannes sheathed his sword, then grabbed his left sleeve with his right hand and pulled. After a bit of struggle, the sleeve eventually tore off, revealing his wrinkled and bony arm.

""Wha…""?

Johannes then drew his sword and took the Alber Stance. His muscles began to grow and regain their definition. ""I am using this Völund to ensure you face the strongest version of me. Be honored, Futsunushi! No one has ever fought me at my true Prime!""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""His true Prime?"" Göll asked.

""Reginleif's ability granted by her name '**Power-Tracer**.'"" Brunhilde explained. ""Reginleif's ability scanned Johannes' history, and when activated grants him the physical and mental prowess of all his theoretical peaks. He now has the strength of his youth, and the experience of his golden years. Johannes is without a doubt a powerful swordsman even in his old age. The fact that he's here in Heaven with this state being his Golden Age proves it. However, he's the kind of man who's still young at heart and refuses to let his age hold him back.""

""So he's now at his strongest in everything?""

""Close, Göll. Rather than say Johannes is in his Golden Age or Golden Years, what we're seeing now is his *Golden Era*, hence the Völund;

**Chronicle of the Sword Master**

His multiple peaks and experience combined with this Völund have created a Johannes Lichtenauer no one has ever fought or seen before."" Brunhilde crossed her arms, and smiled. ""We have witnessed the birth of a Sword Master many only dare to become or write about in stories.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



""True Prime?"" Futsunushi asked.

""Exactly. This damn place acts like this old body of mine is my 'Golden Age.' More like my 'Golden Years.'"" Johannes spit on the ground. ""I call nonsense. With this handy Völund, all the peaks of my life culminate at one point, creating the ultimate body and mind. Do you know what this means for you?"" Futsunushi tilted his head to the side in confusion. ""You have the *ultimate* opponent in front of you, Futsunushi. And it would be such a shame for you not make the most of it."" Johannes said smiling deviously.

""Wait…that means *you* weren't fighting at your fullest, either!"" Futsunushi shouted while pointing at Johannes. ""That's the pot calling the kettle black!""

Johannes laughed. ""You're right. I'm sorry about that, Futsunushi. I let my ego get the better of me. I won't allow it to disrespect you again."" A powerful and heavy aura emanated from him. His stare intensified as his pupils dilated. ""*Come at me, Futsunushi. I'm old after all. Do you want to win by 'natural causes?'""*

Chills ran up Futsunushi's spine. The reality set in. The opponent in front of him for most of the fight has been fighting him at full power; a level no one else ever got to contend with. Such a thing almost seemed unfair. And he had this fight all to himself. An aura burst from Futsunushi, clashing with Johannes'. Futsunushi placed his left foot in front, pointing his scabbard at Johannes, his smile nearly contorting his face from pure joy. *""*Don't think I will*.""* Futsunushi stayed right where he stood.

""No?""

""Exactly. I've been running all day, and honestly? I'm tired as hell. I'd rather take a page out of your book this time…'Sensei.'"" Futsunushi sneered as he 'honored' Johannes with the title.

""Well aren't you just the respectful type? Well, since good teachers learn from their students…"" Johannes sheathed his sword. One second passed, and Johannes drew his sword and vanished; the ground where he stood broken up from dash. Futsunushi looked down and saw Johannes glaring at him, right in the middle of a one-handed stab. Was what Johannes used part of Harnischfechten? *Nay*! In the realm of Johannes' style, the langes schwert could be wielded in a myriad of ways. Fighting armored opponents? Batter them with Harnischfechten or stab through links in their chain mail! However, this would no longer work against Futsunushi. He began forgoing his weighted protection for increased speed. This called for a change in tactics…Blossfechten! The art of unarmored sword combat. When fighting a faster, nimble, unarmored opponent, one must fight with 'long-sword' or 'short-sword' depending on the opponent's style. Futsunushi's current style brought to mind many opponents Johannes fought before; a simple but effective type of combat that wielded two weapons for simultaneous offense and defense; the sword and buckler. While Futsunushi's scabbard was not a perfect reflection of the technique, it was more just similar enough for Johannes to use against him. What does one do when fighting an opponent with such weapons? Simple! Move and strike at them from one side to prevent use of both weapons…or get past the danger zone of both into close-quarters. However, the truth of all this is that the move Johannes just used is not traditional Blossfechten. Rather…it was a near-perfect copy of his opponent's Iaijutsu!

*When did he get this fast!?* Futsunushi screamed in his thoughts. The thrust, while close, displaced the air around it violently as it sailed towards Futsunushi's solar plexus. Futsunushi jumped back reflexively, parrying the thrust with his scabbard. Johannes rolled his sword around the parry, stepping forward with his right foot and slashing diagonally from Futsunushi's waist up to his right shoulder. Futsunushi could feel the tip of the blade gliding across his torso, cutting ever so slightly into his flesh. Johannes twisted his wrist and began to swing back down. Futsunushi swung his sword in a horizontal slash, the blade aimed right at Johannes' ribs just below his armpit. Johannes let his knees go out from under him, making him dip just below Futsunushi's swing. Rather than continue his cut, Johannes made his play. Using the opening created by his offensive, Johannes soared down. Futsunushi hopped back as Johannes slammed his pommel into the ground, kicking up a massive dust cloud. Futsunushi scanned the site for movement as he landed, sheathing his sword in preparation for an attack. Johannes dashed out of the cloud, and appeared right in front of Futsunushi. He stabbed straight up at the soft point between Futsunushi's ribs, right at his heart. Even if five seconds had passed by the point, a dull metal blade with a fine point could still pierce flesh if used correctly. Futsunushi stepped back as he drew his sword. Johannes' stab barely missed its mark as Futsunushi's slash flew towards Johannes' brow. The blade made contact. Despite his efforts to twist his head out of the way, Futsunushi's cut shaved against his temple. Futsunushi quickly twisted his wrist inwards, grasped his katana with both hands as he swung and stepped with his left foot, and cut once more. Johannes caught the slash with the strong of his sword and parried is over his head. He quickly slammed his sword into Futsunushi's chest, then neck, then stepped left to strike down on Futsunushi's right clavicle. Futsunushi caught it on the strong of katana, parrying it past his and slamming his katana into Johanns' stomach, sending him reeling back. Despite the pain, Johannes kept his sword in front of him and regained his form. Johannes grew a small smile under his moustache while blood trickled from his cut temple.

""What an exchange! Futsunushi's using Fechten! Johannes, Iai! These two're breakin' down the walls of the world with nothin' but their swords! That last exchange was incredible, folks! Neither swordsman is yieldin'!"" Heimdall yelled to the crowd.

""Futsunushi!"" Johannes yelled. ""Don't even try using my techniques against me! Do you think I don't know how to beat my own moves?""

""Couldn't help it, Sensei! Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery after all!"" Futsunushi said returning the smile.

""Ah…that's true! What'd you think of my Iai then?"" Futsunushi paused for a moment. He could tell by the shape of Johannes Langes Schwert that it was a sword designed for stabbing and cutting. The blade's straight double-edge made it rather impractical compared the curved, single-edge of a Katana. Yet…his footwork, technique, strength, and posture were impeccable. Even using a sword outside of its intended use seemed so familiar to the old swordsman in front of him, Futsunushi was forced to face a harsh truth. This man could use his own techniques against him, not in spite of, but because he knew the nuances of the Langes Schwert so well he could accommodate. This realization, along with how the match has unfolded, caused a powerful and painful storm of emotions to swell within Futsunushi. Shame at his own arrogance, shame at his disrespect to both his teacher and brother through his sloppy actions, and shame towards the swordsman in front of him.

Futsunushi sheathed his sword. He removed the katanas from his waist sash and from his back, placing them both in front of him, edges facing away from Johannes. He then got to his knees, and bowed deeply. His forehead and palms both pressed to the ground. ""It was magnificent, Sensei. Truly.""

""What are you doing?""

""This…what is this!? Futsunushi is bowin' to his opponent!?"" Heimdall screamed.

""I have disrespected you, and I disrespected my school with my actions and words. I am sorry.""

""I don't want your apologies. I want to keep fighting. This isn't about you, boy. It's about the survival of my species and the preservation of swordsmanship.""

Futsunushi's head shot straight up, the look in his eyes penetrating. ""Of course it's about Humanity and Swordsmanship! You *created* it! That's why this must be treated with the respect and dignity it deserves! Because Mankind, not the Gods, reached mastery first! We fell short because we relied too much on our strength and not our effort and skill, and now *we* must catch up. And to do that you we must defeat you. When else would such a chance come again!?""

""Reached Mastery?""

""Yes! The pinnacle of skill honed through years of blood, sweat, and tears! How many have sacrificed life's pleasures and other dreams to reach it?""

Johannes sighed. *He's one of them.* He thought. ""Futsunushi, rise."" Johannes sheathed his sword, his muscles shrinking. Futsunushi stood up, leaving his swords on the ground. The wind blew between them, kicking up dirt. The store's loose wooden window blinds fluttered from the breeze, knocking softy against their window frames. ""Mastery…is not a destination or a state of being. It is…the starting point of a whole new journey. Many have tried to reach the start only to fall short, and few walk the path for very long. It's not romantic, and it's more often than not tragic. How many do you think I saw fall short…or die by my hands along the way?"" His voice softened as he spoke. Memories from his life returned and came slowly into focus. Futsunushi remained silent, his gaze softening at the somber tone in his opponent's voice. ""But you know this, don't you?"" Futsunushi's eyes widened. ""You figured it out a long time ago…and the idea of what could possibly be waiting for you on the road is terrifying.""

The idea of mastery was painful, yet beautiful. Futsunushi always imagined what it would be like. The images he used to envision of glory and respect returned. But he was alone in them. Everywhere he looked in them, he was alone. Except behind him. He was too afraid to look behind, knowing what was there. Knowing what may be sacrificed on the way. Who may be sacrificed. ""I've come too far to stop, and getting cold feet won't resolve anything. I know I started all this without thinking what I may pay to achieve my dreams, but I won't blame myself for it.""

""Never did any good anyways.""

""Ha!"" Futsunushi chuckled. ""It's heavy sometimes…but 'Meister,' I will continue on, even if my heart's not always in it. That's why I hope you will give this fight your all."" Futsunushi slipped his left foot under his two swords, and kicked them up in the air. He snatched them quickly and put them back on his waist and back.

""Nothing wrong with having days where your heart's not in it, but I'm going to teach you how to fight on regardless. Ready, Futsunushi?"" Johannes gripped his scabbard in his left hand.

""Absolutely, Meister."" Johannes could never admit it to his opponent, or the people in the audience, but Futsunushi's dream was one he held himself, but not just for mastery but an even more childish one; to be the greatest Swordsman history could tell of. His youth revealed a budding talent for it; almost enviable in the eyes of his peers and teachers. So much so, it fueled a deep fire in his soul that inspired long journeys across the European continent. Facing language and culture barriers, Johannes refused to let them get in the way of his dream. Through observation, practice, and constant battle, he achieved something close to his goal. Those years of his life spent on the sword became an irreplaceable treasure, but required a terrible price that he failed to realize until his old age. A price he himself still ponders every now and then. Friendships, love, other opportunities. Was his dream such a thing worth sacrificing all that for? Was Futsunushi ready to do it? This was the only chance he had to confirm it, and it might be too much of a price to pay.

""Sis, why is Johannes acting like that?"" Göll asked.

""I can only imagine, but it may be because of what those two sword nuts have in common."" Göll stared at her sister, vexed. ""Dreams, Göll. That one word drives the two. Every man, woman, and child carries dreams. Even gods. They motivate us to continue when life is challenging. They become the cornerstones of our very existences. Yet…they are monstrous weights.""

""Huh?""

Brunhilde inhaled deeply, closing her eyes. The words came to her, but she struggled slightly to bring them to the surface. ""Dreams can become the weight we bear to strengthen ourselves, or they become unbearable burdens that crush us. When we achieve them, the truth is we never know if they were worth it. Our dreams…can kill us. There are countless souls who failed to achieve their grand dreams. Many despaired and lost hope. Then…there are those like Johannes.""

""'Cause he achieved his, right?""

""No. He failed. Harder than many in pursuit of his own dream.""

""But he's the Master of Masters! How could he be thought so highly of after failing!?""

""It's because he failed. He's not the Master of Masters because he's the strongest of them all.""

""Then why?""

""It's because to many of those swordsmen and women down there, he's the best teacher they ever had. He's the Master of Masters because every student who survived his teachings became Masters of such renown each of them became legends in their own right."" Göll stood in silence at the revelation. ""And now he has another student to train."" Brunhilde scoffed and crossed her arms, leering down at the dusty arena. ""Wonder if he can handle it?""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Futsunushi unsheathed his sword and took his scabbard in hand. He connected the kashira of his katana to the opening in his scabbard. A small clicking sound came from the connection. He shook it a little, confirming the connection was secure. ""Meister. I know we are swordsmen, but you reminded me of something."" Futsunushi said. ""Swords are not only the weapon, but the idea. They are such versatile tools they can become whatever we need them to be at a moment's notice. Hammers, spears, staffs, but sometimes it's not enough. This form before you is a testament to this. Please watch as I show you the next Kata of my art."" Johannes drew his sword and went into Phlug. Futsunushi stepped out with his left foot and brought the impromptu weapon close to his waist, the point aimed forward. ""*Futsu-ryū Sixth Kata; Jetstream.""*

Futsunushi crept forward, keeping his form steady. Johannes began to move as well, stepping slowly forward while stepping slightly to the left and right. Swords like the Langes Schwert are at a disadvantage against polearms due to reach, but both fighters knew it did not guarantee anything. Both also knew the first to enter their ideal range would capitalize quickly, and who would likely get there first. Johannes could not let him. The whole time they fought, Futsunushi continued to grow out of his complacency and become dangerous. There were many times he tried to take the victory, but Futsunushi's skill was not all talk. The gap between them continued to shrink, and he knew time was not on his side. Just before Futsunushi could attack, Johannes kicked off the ground and dashed towards Futsunushi. He had to get past the danger-zone of the dull blade's point; even dulled he knew Futsunushi could strike with enough force to kill him.

Futsunushi knew he would try this. Jumping back along with him, Futsunushi jerked his hand back and twisted right, the unorthodox naginata sliding back between his fingers until the Tsuba hit the webbing of his hand. Johannes' stab missed. Futsunushi landed on both feet, and crouched. He then stepped forward with his right foot and sprung forward out of the crouch. His body twisted as he exhaled and snapped his hand forward. His naginata flew forward, straight towards Johannes' chest. Futsunushi grasped the end of the scabbard just before it left his hand and lunged. Johannes failed to react, and the blade made contact with his sternum. His whole body lurched from the force of the blow. His sword flew out of his hand as he flew back, falling and rolling in the dirt, landing face-down. Had Futsunushi abandoned swordsmanship to deal with Johannes? Indeed! Did that mean he abandoned his style? NAY! Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū, the style Futsunushi inspired through Futsu-ryū, is not truly a school that uses one weapon or one technique. Rather, it was one of the earliest schools in the illustrious history of Japanese Martial Arts to emphasize the very thing Johannes taught; versatility. Students of the art are required to not only learn Drawing and basic Sword techniques, but also Short Sword, Two Sword, Staff, Naginata, Spear, Shuriken, and even Jiujitsu! In the Sengoku Era, even Ninjutsu. Strategy, and Tactics were taught. It was truly a near all-encompassing school, and Futsunushi is now showcasing other facets of his style. He knew the sword was versatile, but not perfect. In the countless hours and days of his training, he discovered he had to expand his skillset and broaden his horizons to truly become a Master, just as Takemikazuchi did when he created and honed Sumo. Futsunushi took his naginata in both hands as he ran towards Johannes, separating it and sheathing his sword. He moved just fast enough to clear the distance as the timer ran down. He quickly drew his sword, reformed his naginata and brought it to his right-side edge-down. He quickly swung upwards, the blade barely skimming across the dirt as it sailed towards Johannes' face. Johannes rolled to the left, the blade clipping his right shoulder as it passed. Futsunushi could not let his opponent get back up. He pivoted off his left foot to face Johannes and slashed again. Johannes could not roll away quick enough. Rather, he kicked his feet forward and spun, the blade barely touching his beard as it passed. Mid-swing, Futsunushi twisted his naginata edge-down and swung. There was not enough time to dodge again. Johannes was without his sword and five seconds had not passed. This blow would without a doubt kill him. This was the first time in a long time he felt such desperation, and nothing sparks innovation like it.

The effect of Chronicle of The Sword Master, even without the sword in-hand, was still in effect due to the sword being drawn. Johannes' reflexes and strength were still at their theoretical peaks. It was because of this he could make the gambit even remotely possible. He grabbed his scabbard with his left, took it in both hands and braced. The attack slammed into him like a boulder. He felt the dirt street give way as his body imprinted on it. He had survived, but was pinned. The five seconds had passed, but that did not stop Futsunushi. Futsunushi twisted the naginata edge-up and hooked Johannes' scabbard. He raked it back to open up Johannes for one good hard stab. The force of the pull lifted Johannes ever so slightly, and he took it. Johannes let go of his scabbard. The sudden loss of resistance caused Futsunushi to lose his balance. Johannes used the momentum to get his feet under him, and tackled right into Futsunushi's torso. Futsunushi felt the wind get knocked out of him by Johannes' shoulder stabbing into his solar plexus, but the old man was not done. Bracing his legs and back, Johannes clasped Futsunushi's legs, hoisted Futsunushi into the air on his shoulder and slammed him back into the earth. ""*Zettel 54!""* Johannes roared as he flew back towards the ground. Futsunushi gasped for air. Johannes quickly stood back up and delivered a powerful soccer-ball kick to Futsunushi's right wrist. The force of the blow created a popping sound and sent Futsunushi's naginata flying away. Johannes scanned the area quickly and saw his sword and scabbard. He dashed as quickly as he could. The strike from earlier and the fall did a number on his chest and shoulder, and his breathing was starting to get heavy. He scooped up his scabbard mid-dash and full-on sprinted towards his sword. Behind him, Futsunushi managed to get himself up, and studied his wrist. His hand was bent out of place, dislocated but not broken. He ran to grab his naginata, picking it up and holding it in his teeth. Biting down, he grabbed his wrist and pulled. The bones re-set with a nasty pop, and a jolt of pain erupted from his wrist. Making some quick movements to ensure it could move properly, Futsunushi broke down the naginata and re-sheathed his sword as Johannes did the same.

The two stared daggers at each other. Then smiled. Then chuckled.

""So you're not just a swordsman?""

""I am so much more! I shall never forsake the things Susano'o-Sensei taught me. However…I realized there's still so much I must learn. I love the Sword, but there's only so much it can do. That's why, I tasked myself with the duty to learn all I could. That way…I could prove my dedication, and my gratitude…to Sensei, to Set, and Humanity.""

""Humanity as well?""

""Sensei made us realize how stagnant we are when it comes to things like this. So few appreciate the effort and skill it takes. That's why my Sensei means the world to me. Set gave me a chance to shine, where so many scoffed at me. And Humanity…showed me that there are things even we have yet to attain."" The cloths around Futsunushi's legs, arms, and torso began to tear. They ripped clean through and fell to the ground in heavy thuds, creating craters in the dirt. The air around Futsunushi calmed. The hair band holding his bun in place tore, and hair flowed around him. Futsunushi stretched and hopped a little. He floated ever slightly in the air with each hop.

""Meister."" Reginleif said.

""What is it, Reginleif?"" Johannes spoke.

""He's back in full form. It's about to get worse.""

""I had a feeling. This whole time he's been fighting handicapped. Not that he wanted to, probably. That Sensei of his is a real piece of work to put his student in such a harrowing situation.""

""Haven't you done that before?"" Johannes said nothing. ""Glass houses and stones, Meister."" Johannes chuckled. ""Please don't forget. We're fighting to save Humanity.""

""Don't worry. I may not be a violent god-killer, but…"" He began to glare at Futsunushi ""I have no intention of forgetting my responsibilities."" Johannes drew his sword and took Alber.

How long had it been since Futsunushi felt so free? 600? 800 years? Longer? He had grown so used to the weight he felt naked without it. It was always there, reminding him of what he strove for and what he must pay. The loss of it was oddly, anxiety-inducing. The point had come, the opponent he needed to defeat in front of him. He was *finally* there! Why then…

Futsunushi dashed and drew his sword, combining it once more with the scabbard to form it's Naginata form, now favoring his left side. He did not bother waiting to get close. He had gotten used to the shift in weight from his weapon and decided to go on the offensive. He closed the gap and swung towards Johannes' torso as he stopped his rush. Johannes waited. As he swung, Futsunushi raised his arm, redirecting the slash towards Johannes' neck. Johannes waited. Futsunushi redirected once more, realigning it with Johannes' torso. Johannes drew his sword back into the Phlug stance ready to parry. But the slash never came. Futsunushi flicked his left hand back, throwing his weapon all the way back into his right. The blade completely missed Johannes, but that was never the intention. Futsunushi had turned his slash into a right twist, taken the perfect stance to once more, thrust his Naginata with all his strength to pierce his opponent, flicking to grasp the end of the scabbard once more. Johannes could not parry it in time. Rather, he simply side-stepped to the left. The thrust carried more weight behind it than before, leaving it out in the air for just an additional millisecond or so. Just enough time for Johannes to flick his sword back and catch it by the blade. The thrust could not be stopped. Even if Futsunushi had shed more weight, the one thing he could not lose was the weight of his sword. Katanas are designed to carry their weight over the blade rather than the entire body of the sword. It was meant to aid in their cutting power, but in this case all it meant was a naginata that suffered from the same drawback. The weight of the blade and the force of the thrust pulled Futsunushi along the path of a powerful horizontal swing from Johannes' makeshift hammer. He could not dodge it; the timing was perfect. He had no choice but pull his naginata back place it in front of the hammer.

The edge of the blade collided with the cross-guard…cracked and then shattered. It slowed down the strike ever so slightly, but the force behind it was more than enough to slam into Futsunushi's chest and send him flying. The broken katana flew out of his hands and landed with a heavy thud, which did not go unnoticed. ""What?"" Johannes said, shocked.

""Holy tarnations, folks! These two Fighters are proving their grit in this match! The pace keeps shiftin' from one side to the other without pause! However, it looks like Johannes came out on top in this one! Can Futsunushi recover!? Can he even get up?"" Heimdall screamed.

*Something's wrong.* Johannes thought. *The attack was perfect. The guard hit Futsunushi straight on. It should have shattered his damn sternum. It was meant to be payback for the earlier attack even. Why did it feel like I didn't hit anything?* He stared at the broken sword pieces on the ground. Keeping an eye on Futsunushi as he recovered, Johannes determined he needed to find out was going on. He walked over to a large piece of the blade and reached down to pick it up. He struggled to lift it initially, but managed to get it in his free hand and hold it. *This is heavy, and one end of this piece is even heavier than the other!? What's with this weight displacement?*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



""It's time, Futsunushi."" Susano'o said. ""Time to use your real sword.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Futsunushi slapped his palms on the ground. The force of the blows launched him back onto his feet, his hair still flowing in the air. A light bruise began to form where Johannes struck him. ""Surprised?"" Futsunushi asked.

""Won't lie, I am. Even the damn sword was a weight?"" Johannes responded.

""Yes, it was. Not nearly as heavy as the other weights, but it was designed with poor weight displacement to make it incredibly difficult to use. Guess once again you showed how much is still required to beat you. With this being the case, I guess I have no choice but to use my actual sword.""

Futsunushi reached back and grasped the handle of his other Katana. He pulled it out slowly, allowing the soft sound of metal brushing against wood to fill his ears. Fully drawn, it looked no different from the other Katana, but Johannes could sense it. This sword was beyond dangerous, and now Futsunushi was completely untethered.

**Futsu-no-Mitama**

The atmosphere between the two changed. A clear, vibrant image filled their vision. A mountain top sitting above the clouds, the rising sun in the distance. The two of them alone in pure silence. ""So is this what it looks like?"" Futsunushi asked.

""Depends on the person, but welcome to it Futsunushi. Welcome to the start of your journey in Mastery. Now come, it's time for your first steps."" Johannes took the Vom Tag guard, keeping his sword edge just above his right shoulder and standing in Futsunushi's way. ""*Come at me, boy!""*",2,1731777960.0,RecordOfOurRagnarok,0,1.0,False

**Proposal for LLM-Powered Spellcheck and Autocorrect: A FOSS Initiative**
**Introduction**

---


In today’s digital landscape, mobile devices are essential for communication, yet the spellcheck and autocorrect systems that support our typing often disappoint. Users frequently encounter inaccurate corrections, limited personalization options, and a lack of adaptability to individual writing styles. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding and predicting language, their integration into mobile keyboards remains superficial. Typically confined to peripheral features or requiring complex setups, current implementations fail to fully harness the potential of LLMs to enhance core typing functionalities.

This proposal advocates for a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)-led initiative to seamlessly integrate LLMs into the fundamental spellcheck and autocorrect systems of mobile keyboards. By adhering to FOSS principles, we aim to deliver superior predictive text capabilities that prioritize user privacy, offer extensive customization, and foster community-driven development.

---

**Problem Statement**

Current mobile spellcheck and autocorrect systems are hindered by several key issues:

- **Limited Predictive Accuracy:** Traditional algorithms often misunderstand context, leading to irrelevant or incorrect suggestions.
- **Lack of Personalization:** Existing systems provide minimal customization, making it difficult for users to tailor predictions to their unique writing styles.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Many predictive text solutions rely on sending data to external servers, raising significant privacy issues.
- **Resource Inefficiency:** Integrating sophisticated models like LLMs can be resource-intensive, impacting device performance and battery life.

These limitations underscore the need for an advanced, privacy-respecting, and customizable predictive text system that effectively adapts to individual user needs.

---

**Vision and Goals**

**Vision:** To develop an intelligent, seamless, and user-centric spellcheck and autocorrect system powered by LLMs, fully integrated into mobile keyboards through collaborative FOSS development.

**Goals:**

1. **Enhanced Predictive Accuracy:** Leverage the contextual understanding of LLMs to deliver more precise and relevant word predictions and corrections.
2. **User Empowerment:** Provide extensive customization options, enabling users to adjust predictive text features to their unique writing preferences.
3. **Transparency and Trust:** Develop the system as open-source software to ensure transparency in data processing and foster user trust through community oversight.
4. **Privacy Respect:** Ensure all data processing occurs locally on the device, eliminating the need for data transmission to external servers.
5. **Community-Driven Development:** Encourage collaboration among developers, designers, and users to continuously improve and adapt the system.

**Alignment with FOSS Values:**

- **Transparency:** Open-source code allows for inspection, modification, and improvement by anyone.
- **User Empowerment:** Users maintain control over their data and the customization of their predictive text experience.
- **Community Collaboration:** Leveraging the collective expertise of the FOSS community to drive innovation and address challenges collaboratively.

---

**Challenges and Technical Considerations**

Developing an LLM-powered spellcheck and autocorrect system for mobile keyboards involves several challenges:

1. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - **Challenge:** LLMs are computationally demanding, potentially straining mobile device resources.
   - **Solutions:** Optimize models for mobile environments using techniques like quantization and pruning. Implement efficient inference methods to balance performance with resource consumption.

2. **Integration Complexity:**
   - **Challenge:** Seamlessly embedding LLMs into existing mobile keyboard architectures without disrupting functionality or user experience.
   - **Solutions:** Develop modular components for easy integration across different keyboard frameworks and ensure compatibility with various operating systems and devices.

3. **Privacy Concerns:**
   - **Challenge:** Maintaining user privacy by processing sensitive data locally without sending it to external servers.
   - **Solutions:** Utilize edge computing to handle all processing on-device. Implement robust encryption and secure data handling practices to protect user information.

4. **Maintaining Responsiveness:**
   - **Challenge:** Delivering real-time predictive text suggestions without lag to preserve a smooth typing experience.
   - **Solutions:** Optimize model latency through efficient coding and leverage hardware accelerators. Employ asynchronous processing to prevent user interface blocking.

5. **Customization and Adaptability:**
   - **Challenge:** Allowing users to personalize autocorrect and spellcheck functionalities to their specific needs.
   - **Solutions:** Provide intuitive interfaces for customization settings and enable the system to learn and adapt to individual writing patterns over time.

---

**Call to Action**

To realize this vision, we need the collective effort of the FOSS community. Your expertise and passion can drive this initiative forward. Here’s how you can contribute:

**Who Can Contribute:**

- **Developers:** With skills in machine learning, mobile development, and open-source projects, your expertise is crucial for building and optimizing the LLM-integrated system.
- **Designers:** Help create intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that facilitate customization and enhance the overall user experience.

5. **Community Engagement:**
   - Share progress updates, seek feedback, and encourage broader community involvement to continuously refine and enhance the system.

---

**Illustrative Example**

Imagine typing a message where the autocorrect not only fixes typos but also understands the context of your conversation. For instance, typing ""I'll meet you at the park,"" the system might suggest ""I'll meet you at the coffee shop,"" based on your usual meeting locations or recent conversations. Unlike current systems that offer generic corrections, an LLM-powered autocorrect provides intelligent, context-aware suggestions that enhance communication accuracy and efficiency.

---

**Privacy as a Core Concern**

1gsrvpe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gsrvpe,True confessions of an eDad,"This felt like it took so long to redact. Sorry for any inconsistent colours.

- M = my uBPD mother
- B = my brother

After a very guilt-trippy email from my eDad some time ago that caused me to have a mental breakdown my bf offered to be a mediator of sorts. My dad is now not allowed to contact me directly and must contact my bf. This has saved me the anxiety spike that I get when I see a text/email/get a call from my dad, which is great, and I am still also able to contact my dad for things I need and vice versa. My bf is extremely patient and has gone through some similar things with his own parents in the past. I trust him completely to protect and help me. For the longest time I wanted to spare him from my family issues and not have him get involved. But things got to the point where I could not continue to do that and keep my mental health at a stable level.

This is an email from my eDad to my bf. My bf wanted to get coffee with my dad so that they could talk. I have no problem with this and I think it will help a little with understanding from both sides (although I don't think anything will make my eDad understand me fully, although one can dream). If the email looks weird its because it was copied and pasted into my notes app.

I won't get into the content of the email too much because then I'll go on forever. But some notes:
- notice how he cherry-picked the most innocuous instance of her controlling behaviour (and although innocuous does display some of her rampant neuroticism)
- ""she only wants us to be safe, clothed, and fed"" conveniently does not bring up the countless instances of verbal and emotional abuse
- never uses the word ""abuse""
- excuses her behaviour because of her being ESL and her own traumatic upbringing
- him projecting that my bf would keep secrets from me because that is what my dad does in his own relationship",1,1731777092.0,raisedbyborderlines,0,1.0,False
1gsrveu,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1gsrveu/almost_made_it/,Almost made it ,"

I have been in the migraine tornado for most of my (37F) life. The last 5 chronic years have been especially tough, then I made it to Ajovy. After my second injection I didn't have a migraine for over 2 months, longer than I have maybe ever gone. I thought my life had changed completely, I was forgetting my sunglasses at home, I saw live music, I did the longest bike ride and highest hike in years. I peed a normal amount! I ATE a normal amount. I was hesitant to feel hope but eventually grew happier, and excited to break the cycle (rizatriptan, on and off of caffeine, popping whatever otcs are around out of desperation) even if for a moment. 

But now here I am in the tub, triggered by a workout (signed up for weight lifting in the life changing moment lol), taken my 5th riza in the last ten days, plus an edible, electrolit, coffee, salt, ice pack to no avail.. back to some migraine activity every day. I am able to function through most (but damn it was so much harder after I knew what normal was like) but today is not the case. 

Is this a fluke? Does ajovy still have a chance or was it a hopeful placebo? 

I am so deeply sad, it's been so hard to live this way as you all know, and it has been so hard getting that tease of what my life could be, and then having the helplessness come back. 

I am usually just a lurker but thought it may help to start being vulnerable and validated around folks who get it.",4,1731777071.0,migraine,5,1.0,False

1gsrsqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1gsrsqm/beribes_bluetooth_hifi_stereo_wireless_headphones/,Beribes Bluetooth HiFi Stereo Wireless Headphones are a game changer for my music experience,"It’s been a while since I’ve genuinely felt excited about headphones, but these BERIBES Bluetooth headphones have completely taken me by surprise. Right from the first song I played, it felt like I was hearing some of my favorite tracks with fresh ears. You know that moment when a familiar song suddenly reveals layers you never noticed before? That’s exactly what happened when I played **Bohemian Rhapsody** by Queen. The harmonies were so distinct that I could almost picture each band member standing in their own corner of the room, their voices crystal clear and beautifully balanced.

The bass on these things is something else. It’s punchy and energetic, not the overblown, muddy kind you get with some budget headphones. Listening to **Kanye’s “Stronger”** gave me this addictive rhythm that had me tapping my feet without even realizing it. The cool thing is, the bass doesn’t overpower the mids and highs. Every sound feels like it’s got its own space to breathe—vocals, instruments, background details—it’s all there and easy to pick apart.

Now, about those **6 EQ modes**—I wasn’t sure how much I’d actually use them at first. I mean, how different can “modes” really be? But wow, switching between them depending on what you’re listening to actually makes a big difference. When I was in the mood for some chill acoustic stuff, the treble-focused setting made the guitar strings feel so intimate, like a live performance in my living room. And then when I wanted some bass-heavy tracks for a workout, switching to the Deep Bass mode gave the music that extra energy boost. It’s fun experimenting and finding the perfect setting for each genre.

Comfort-wise, these are a total win. I spend a lot of time on my headphones—working, watching shows, zoning out to music—and not once have these felt heavy or annoying to wear. The ear cups are soft and big enough to fully cover my ears without that horrible pinching feeling. I even forgot I had them on during a 3-hour Netflix binge session the other night.

The battery life is unreal. I’ve been using them pretty much nonstop for the past week, and I haven’t had to charge them yet. Seriously, the **65 hours of playtime** claim seems legit. For someone like me who always forgets to charge my devices, this is a lifesaver.

One thing I didn’t expect to appreciate so much is how compact and foldable they are. I’ve taken them to a couple of coffee shops and tossed them in my bag without worrying about them breaking. They’re lightweight but don’t feel cheap, which is a hard balance to pull off.

If there’s one thing I’d nitpick, it’s that these don’t have active noise cancellation. They do a decent job of passively blocking out noise, but if you’re in a super loud environment, you’ll still catch some background sounds. Also, while the mic is good enough for work calls and casual chats, it’s not something I’d use for professional recording or streaming. But hey, for this price point, those are small trade-offs.

All in all, I feel like I hit the jackpot with these. They’ve made me want to dig back into old playlists and rediscover tracks I’d forgotten about because they sound so alive now. For anyone on the fence about trying them, just go for it. They’re ridiculously good value for what they offer—great sound, long battery life, comfort, and versatility. I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed a pair of headphones this much at this price range.

If you’ve tried them too, let me know what you think. I’m curious if they’ve blown your mind as much as they’ve blown mine...",0,1731776869.0,headphones,5,0.09,False
1gsrsmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1gsrsmi/symptoms_worse_during_ovulation/,Symptoms worse during ovulation,"To make a long story short, I'm turning 45 in a few weeks and have been experiencing all the major symptoms of perimenopause for over a year and a half, except for irregular periods.  Up until a couple of months ago, my periods were still like clockwork, with some minor streaking between periods.  Now, they are lasting longer, they're getting heavier, and I'm noticing more spotting and bleeding between periods.

Right now, I'm only a couple of days from ovulation.  I woke up this morning with period-like cramping, and when I stood up from the table after drinking my coffee, I felt a small gush.  I went into the bathroom and I'm bleeding like it's the first day of my period.  The blood is dark red.  Mild spotting or streaking has been normal for me during ovulation for a long time and I've had it checked out, but bleeding like this is new and I'm freaked out today.

I am going to the doctor in a few weeks to talk about all of this, but I just want some reassurance or to hear from others who have experienced it.  (I do have a history of polyps, so I won't be surprised if they have also returned.)  During ovulation, I feel crampy and moody almost like my period is about to start.  Two nights ago, I was crying my eyes out over something that happened and feeling completely hopeless.  But this bleeding today has sent my anxiety skyrocketing.  The cramping has subsided a bit over the last couple of hours and I'm wearing a pad, so I'm hoping it will dissipate by tomorrow.  Normally my spotting only lasts a day or two and then stops, so I expect this will, too.  But it's extremely unsettling.  I HATE this process.  The worrying about every new symptom is making me crazy.",2,1731776859.0,Menopause,0,1.0,False

Get ready for another exciting game session, this time back where it all began... well, sort of! We're heading to Paradox Comics & Cards on \[Date\] at \[Time\] for an afternoon of demigod adventures, card-slinging action, and collaborative storytelling.

**From Coffee Beans to Battle Cards**

This session feels extra special because it brings Demayth full circle. Many years ago, in the cozy confines of Twenty Below Coffee, fueled by endless cups of caffeine and the creative buzz of the cafe, I penned the first drafts of what would become Demayth.

The friendly baristas, the eclectic mix of patrons, and the overall inspiring atmosphere of Twenty Below played a huge role in shaping the game's early development. I even borrowed a few character names and plot ideas from the conversations I overheard (don't worry, I changed them enough to avoid any awkward encounters!).

**A Tribute to Creative Spaces**

This upcoming session at Paradox is a tribute to those inspiring spaces that nurture creativity and community. Whether it's a local game store like Paradox, a cozy cafe like Twenty Below, or your own kitchen table, Demayth is meant to be shared and enjoyed in the company of friends.

Are there any reliable notes on how much is too much chaga? I'm healthy, no diabetes, no known blood sugar issues other than shoving too much sugar into my bloodstream (working on that one).  I brew my coffee with chaga and labrador tea, usually on a french press. Chaga goes in the kettle that boils the water and gets reused as long as the water keeps coming out very dark, at which point it gets replaced (sooner rather than later, I forage chaga, got a huge surplus).

I finally had it with his shenanigans and confronted him in the mess hall. He continued to gaslight me and deny any of it. I lost my cool and threw my beautiful spaghetti and meatballs at him.

Then the annoying Captain Coffee Breath broke it up with her orders just as I was about to break his flimsy nose with my Talaxian powerpunch from hell.

Get ready for another exciting game session, this time back where it all began... well, sort of! We're heading to Paradox Comics & Cards on 2PM TODAY for an afternoon of demigod adventures, card-slinging action, and collaborative storytelling.

**From Coffee Beans to Battle Cards**

This session feels extra special because it brings Demayth full circle. Many years ago, in the cozy confines of Twenty Below Coffee, fueled by endless cups of caffeine and the creative buzz of the cafe, I penned the first drafts of what would become Demayth.

The friendly baristas, the eclectic mix of patrons, and the overall inspiring atmosphere of Twenty Below played a huge role in shaping the game's early development. I even borrowed a few character names and plot ideas from the conversations I overheard (don't worry, I changed them enough to avoid any awkward encounters!).

**A Tribute to Creative Spaces**

This upcoming session at Paradox is a tribute to those inspiring spaces that nurture creativity and community. Whether it's a local game store like Paradox, a cozy cafe like Twenty Below, or your own kitchen table, Demayth is meant to be shared and enjoyed in the company of friends.

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

———————————-

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://www.costa.co.uk/costa-club#app-promo)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **C9HgF**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

Back in the early days of the internet, around 2000–2010, people were kinder, more open and willing to chat or grab a coffee. I remember friends all had time for each other, and when I felt lonely or bored, I’d go out and ask a stranger to join me for a coffee at a café - it was great, and I made some good friends that way.

Nowadays, though, it's a huge shift- friends no longer have time for you, family are no where to be seen, people dismiss you with their hands before you even finish the sentence asking to buy them a coffee. They wave me off, say ""no"" or walk away shooing me with their hands like I’m some kind of pest. It really makes you feel even worse. While some people are in a rush (which is understandable), most are cold, suspicious and uninterested in connection. It's such a huge contrast to how things used to be- at least where I live.

It feels like the world has gotten SO much harsher. If you don’t have a supportive family or close friends nearby, it’s almost impossible to meet new people or form genuine non-romantic connections nowadays. Ironically, on my same walk to the cafe I used to go to 20 years ago, I now see hundreds of people where I used to see just 2 or 3- I don't know why this is but it's a huge increase in the numbers of people here. And they're all in crowds or groups, and very cliquey (it's rare to see someone on their own who isn't in a rush or on their phone nowadays). Also, instead of this increased population making the world feel more connected, it actually is lonelier.

People stick to their groups, avoid outsiders, and don’t seem open to making new friends anymore. Life was way more optimistic and connected even just 15 years ago, and I wonder what’s caused this shift. I feel like social media & work from home culture, has had the opposite effect on people. It’s horrible to see how much things have changed for the worse, and it’s hard not to feel down about the world nowadays especially if you lived through the ""good old days"".

Hi everyone!

I’m a 20-year-old femboy with a passion for all things creative and intellectual. I’m currently studying literature at Oxford University, which is a dream come true for me. I adore immersing myself in stories, whether it’s classic novels or discovering new narratives. When I’m not buried in books, I also work as a model—an experience that’s been both fun and empowering.

A little about me:
	•	I’m autistic, which is an integral part of who I am and shapes the way I see and experience the world. It means I love diving deep into my interests and can get incredibly enthusiastic about the things I’m passionate about!
	•	My style leans feminine, and I enjoy expressing myself in ways that feel authentic and unique to me.
	•	In my free time, I love gaming, baking, and having meaningful conversations about everything from philosophy to pop culture.

I’m looking for someone who values kindness, open-mindedness, and a bit of nerdy charm. Whether you want to exchange book recommendations, chat over coffee (or virtual coffee), or take long walks while debating the merits of various literary genres, I’d love to meet you!

I’ve gotten all sort of answers when asking professionals in the coffee industry who use this grinder regarding how much it needs to be fully seasoned. Some say 10kg, others 20 and some even 30kg. Most people seem to suggest it needs around 10-13kg though. 

I have noticed difference from 3kg in to 6kg and from 6 to 9kg. Difference being fuller cups with more flavor separation and more rounded cups. I I my brew filter with the ulfs. I’m pretty happy with the cups and have no complaints since they allow me to taste every single tasting note of each coffee more or less.

The VC’s should help fund it.,"After learning that the richest VC’s in the world were at various times on Synapse’s board…folks like Andreessen Horowitz's Angela Strange, Core Innovation Capital's Arjan Schütte, and Trinity Ventures' Schwark Satyavolu…these people could raise the 3 million dollars for full reconciliation faster than I could get $.50 on the street for a cup of coffee.

They owe it to the users. They could have kept Synapse solvent long enough to make the users whole then file the bankruptcy.

We really need to organize and rally around the idea of crowdfunding the full reconciliation.

It is absolutely the only reasonably time sensitive way to get funds in the users hands.

If we don’t find a way to fund full reconciliation while the trustee and her team have all of the players assembled (banks, fintechs, synapse, users)…there will be nothing compelling everyone to come together.

We will be left chasing individual lawsuits which will always come to one conclusion….without full reconciliation there is no way to know exactly how much each user is owed and where that money is.

Period.


We need to create the go fund me or similar crowdfunding site and start heavily leaning on these VC’s, asking the public for help, and those who can can donate to the cause ourselves. 

We can do this. But time is a huge factor. Access to the data will not last forever.

the first time i took comlex was during a very difficult/time consuming 3rd year rotation, the second time was during my LOA, as well as my third attempt.  
the first time i only used TL, the second time i did TL and comquest, but the third time i used UW and TL (for TL on this third attempt, mostly only did the ethics and omm, with some medicine sprinkled in).  
on my second attempt i had a bunch of questions i had to blindly bubble in due to my horrible timing. on my third attempt i finished on time, with even a few min to spare actually. i attribute my timing improvement to uworld -- the question stems on uworld are longer than TL, so they're good practice for the medicine questions on comlex. for ethics/omm, i'd say TL is the best. also i hate the WelCOMs but some of the ethics qs on them were very similar to the ones on my exam, so def take a look. make sure you know the childhood developmental milestones well (check out dirty med: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_yV-pR8Xkl8&t=33s) and also the vaccine time line (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrlVbDmCVyw&t=13s) bc i had questions on these that are easy points but also idt they're totally fair bc these topics seem more level 2 oriented...but i digress. i also felt that going through the green book was very helpful, you can skim it, but spend more time on the questions and you can go back to read whatever you don't understand. and obv know sketchy micro and pharm as well as possible, for micro esp the parasites. pharm is pretty well distributed, honestly know all the pharm you can, but i'd say the most high yield are the psych drugs. know the adverse effects and mechanisms, knowing the mechanisms is also helpful for understanding physiology. also know the different breast pathologies, the leukemias and lymphomas, and the neuro tracts and the effects of different lesions on the body's function.  
most importantly, if this is your retake, please keep yourself mentally sane. i took a walk every morning, sometimes i'd treat myself after the walk to a coffee from my favorite coffee shop. if you need a course to keep yourself motivated and regimented, i highly recommend the iomb course -- the course instructor kept me motivated and working through problems with other students helped me a ton. i didn't want to start off this post with saying you should take a course, because ik everyone's financial situation is so different, but if you think you need one, i def would recommend this one. i wish i had taken it after failing the first time. i don't know as much about the PASS program and wolfpacc, but i've heard students benefit from those.  i think the most important thing though if you're a retaker is to continue to push through and not give up...don't let the dark thoughts pervade (i would spiral often and think about how bleak it seemed for me down the line for matching, but you know what? i'll deal with that problem later, rn the focus is on getting thru this god awful exam...things will fall into place later on). as an anxious person who isn't the best test taker and scraped by quite a bit in med school, if i can do it, so can you.",3,1731774996.0,comlex,3,0.81,False

Here's the story: A longtime fixture at my church passed away from a heart condition. He was an usher, led the Italian group, and organized more church family nights than can easily be counted. Sporting events, concerts, even Disney On Ice. So, when his passing was announced, it hit the entire congregation hard. I was asked to serve at his funeral.

After the funeral, there was a reception in the parish hall. Nothing spectacular, just cake & coffee. I was sitting at a table, along with my mother. I registered someone sitting down across from me, and when I looked up, I realized it was a man who used to be an usher. I am ashamed to say, to this day, I can't recall his name. I'm not even sure I knew it. There were a number of people from when I first moved here that I knew by sight, but never knew their names. There was a woman with him who I'd never seen before, so I don't know how she's related to him, if at all. Anyway, we instantly recognize each other, and start the ""how are yous"". Then he asked if I remembered his granddaughter, which I did (again, I can't remember her name either, all I recall is she looked so much like a girl in my geometry class, I asked if they were sisters, which they weren't). He starts to tell me what she's doing now, when the woman sitting with him interrupts.

Karen: ""Will you stop bothering her?!""

Me: ""He's not bothering me, we're talking.""

Karen: (Ignores me completely) ""She's not who you think she is. You don't know her!""

Me: ""Yes he does...""

Usher: ""Yes I do. That's (my name). She just served the funeral!""

Me: ""That's correct!""

Karen: (Still ignoring me) ""The girl who served the funeral had *long* hair!""

Me: (pulls my extremely long pony tail out from behind my back) ""You mean this?""

Karen didn't respond to that, but she did manage to kill the conversation. We all finished our cake & coffee, say goodbye, and left. It was only out of respect to the family of the deceased that I didn't verbally slap that woman. Even if he didn't know me, if I was a complete stranger who he was mistaking for someone else, the world wasn't going to stop spinning on its axis if I sat that for a few minutes and let him talk. The fact that he wasn't mistaken made it even worse. I assume from her actions that he might've been suffering from memory issues. However, I don't think you're just supposed to jump to the conclusion that they're getting it wrong! Plus completely ignoring me as I tried to verify... I sincerely hope that woman gained some clarity along the way.",3,1731774785.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I’ve just completed a rebuild of the La Pavoni Europiccola 1978 model (49mm), which was a wedding gift for my parents. This is my first ""serious"" espresso setup.

I replaced all the gaskets and crafted a new cover for the underside. I also integrated it into my Home Assistant smart-home setup: I can control the heater via a smart relay. To prevent over-pressure, I added a digital thermometer on the group head and am waiting for a pressure transducer from Aliexpress. I’ll make another post with all the steps once the work is complete and all the pieces are in place.

Everything seems to work fine, except for the fact that the coffee starts flowing out when I pull up the lever. Could this be related to tamping too lightly or the grind being too coarse? Does anyone have suggestions?

Today was probably the WORST DAY OF MY LIFE, and I was feeling down the entire time. Around 5 PM, I decided to go on a 50-MINUTE WALK TO SEEB BEACH, but of course, I got there 70 MINUTES LATER, LOL.

When I finally found it, I just CHILLED THERE. The moon was SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL, and it was SO QUIET. I sat down, and honestly, I was in TEARS (not loud or anything visible, just there). After a while, I decided it was time for some COFFEE AND CAKE.

As I was trying to find some café, I saw these GUYS ON HORSES—like, ACTUAL HORSES. I said, “ASSALAM ALAYKUM,” and realized they were from the ROP. There were TWO OF THEM, and they asked for my ID. I was like, “BRO, I HAVE IT AT HOME.” HE ASKED IF I REMEMBER NUMBER AND I WAS CONFUSED I WAS LIKE ""WHATSAPP? yeah yeah ok"" THAT GUY SHOOK HIS HEAD LMFAOOOOO , the guys then just LAUGHED and asked where I was headed. So, I asked him to recommend a coffee place, and he pointed to this café ROSEPICK I THINK? infront OF ME.

I’m TELLING YOU, when I went there, THEY MADE MY DAY. I walked in and asked the guy to MAKE SOMETHING CHOCOLATEY because I didn’t feel like looking at the menu. He brought me some COFFEE, and the price was 1.6 RIYAL. I gave him 2 RIYAL, but then he gave me ONE ENTIRE RIYAL BACK. I was SO CONFUSED! I told him, “BRO, TAKE THE FULL MONEY,” but he was like, “NO, NO, YOU’RE GOOD. IT’S OKAY.”

I finally gave up and was about to leave, but I was SO HAPPY, even I could tell my FACE HAD BRIGHTENED UP. As I was opening the door, THE GUY CALLED ME BACK AND HANDED ME A FREAKING COOKIE!?

BRO, A COOKIE! AND IT TASTED SO DAMN GOOD—like, THE BEST COOKIE I COULD’VE GOTTEN. I went back to the beach, sat down, and had my COFFEE AND THAT COOKIE. I SWEAR, THE COFFEE WAS A SOLID 10/10, AND THE COOKIE WAS A 9/10. SO FREAKING GOOD! I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH THEN I WENT TO EAT SHAWARMA IDK IG ""POTATO SHAWARMA""?

TL;DR - my girlfriend of 2 months broke up with me. said it was not my fault and that the timing was off and she needed a break to clear her mind. I have a feeling I was the problem but I don’t know.

So me and my ex broke up Wednesday morning (who needs coffee when you got that first thing in the morning…) and I haven’t really been taking it very well. She was my first love. She felt like home. Looking back I know it was dumb of me to put so much of my heart into a high school relationship but I couldn’t help it.

We were together for 2 months. The first month was the best month I’ve ever had. I finally got to feel the chaotic and intense feeling that was young love. I was so happy. She truly made me feel like I was normal. I know she wasn’t acting either, she showed genuine love for me.

Then came month two. Just like last month, until around the 3rd week of October. I noticed immediately that she started to emotionally check out. She started withdrawing and putting less effort. Again I noticed that immediately. It just went downhill from there. I tried talking to her several times about it and she just blew it off each time. The last week we were together I started getting upset with our relationship. She wouldn’t text me anymore, wouldn’t do anything basically. I would start being petty and just irrational. 
To give an example: she said that on our anniversary she would write me a love letter text as a good morning but she didn’t, so i texted her “good morning !! i was looking forward to that love letter, i had a feeling u weren’t gonna send one”. That was Wednesday.

She called it quits that morning. She just broke down. She said she said that the timing was just so wrong and she couldn’t take care of herself while also being with me, but that it wasn’t my fault, and she wanted to be alone. She said she was going through things that no one knew about and she needed a break to clear her mind. 

We work at the same place so we see each other regularly. She acts so cold to me now and ignores my existence. She doesn’t seem heartbroken like I am. I don’t get it. If it wasn’t my fault then why do you treat me like this? How in the same 20 minutes can you go from “i love you” to “i can’t be with you anymore”? How was it so easy for you to leave…

Even though she said it wasn’t my fault, i know it was. I was often emotionless and distant towards her. I have sarcastic humor and a lot of it is to talk shit about myself but sometimes that spilled onto her. It felt exhausting to her. She didn’t think I loved her. It destroys me just imagining how she felt with me. All she wanted was just to feel safe.

I just wish she knew how sorry I was. I really would like to try again with her and fix our problems. Obviously I’m not going to ask her that any time soon, maybe around February or March I will. She leaves for college in May",3,1731774572.0,AITAH,8,0.8,False

I'm currently unmedicated because as a kid I STRUGGLED finding a med that worked. Adderall and Ritalin made me crazy, to the point where I was taken off because it was dangerous. I was also on Concerta, but I became very anti-social and didn't want to be around people when I was on it. I had years of my childhood where I was lonely because my meds made me avoid people. I'm pretty sensitive to meds in general and have a long list I can't take. I can't have more than a cup or tea or coffee a day because I start to get anxious and paranoid from the caffeine.

If you turn up and you don't like the person for whatever reason it's not easy to cut it short and get up and leave. You have to wait for your food, it's too intimate and intense. There's no conversation starters around you apart from the food and entertainment in solely on you and the other person. Its just a very unnatural and contrived setting. Also you may get judged for the calibre of establishment you bring your date to. 

Off the top of my head? Darts or pool or mini golf is way better. Its cheaper so you wont worry about the bill situation, all darts and pool places are the same in calibre, you can have some flirty competition, you can easily cut things short, it's casual, the entertaining isn't completely on you, and you can more easily initiate non sexual physical contact.

I felt like I already knew him. When my boyfriend cries I can’t help crying and when he is sick or when I remember moments of suffering from him I cry just as much. When he gave me my first kiss I will never forget it was at the skating rink it was my first kiss and it was wonderful after the first kiss I could not stop I wanted to kiss him more and more. When he kissed me I felt how wet I got. I wanted to hug him and never let go when he left it was hard but I knew I would see him again. My family said a lot of negative things but I didn’t let him and I defended him. With him I have told him my biggest secrets and there is nothing I can’t tell him. I write him poems and songs.

For the first time in my life I felt jealousy a day ago and it was a very strange thing for me. I with him did what I said I would not do and that was to have a moment in the movies me and him it was risky but it was wonderful. I cried and looked him in the eyes and hugged him. I told him to forgive me for having doubts whether I loved him or not and he hugged me and looking into my eyes he told me that nothing was wrong that he knew I loved him and I told him how do you know and he said I see it in your eyes. When he left it hurt too much and I cried a lot waiting for him to come back. I was sad that I could not be with him again on Saturday.

I remembered the moments when we went to eat tacos and he got his hands dirty and I cleaned them, when we ordered those pistachio and triple chocolate ice creams and he didn’t like the pistachio and I tried to take away the pistachio flavor and give him only chocolate. I remembered when I gave him food in his mouth, kissed him, hugged him and how my smile was big and intact. I am not a person who smiles a lot but with him it was impossible not to smile. I felt like taking his hand and never let go. I love to admire him when he is doing something I try to memorize every corner of his face as a work of art. I love when our eyes meet and we smile at each other and he tells me ? and laughs and I swim and laugh. I can’t help but think of him most of the time and always when I pass places I know he likes I say so. When he graduated I wish I could have been there even if I wasn’t there watching him grab his hard earned degree made me cry. Sometimes I have feelings in my heart that I don’t know how to explain.

This is my first relationship and it will be my only one. Sometimes I feel something warm in my heart that comes and goes. If I could make one wish it would be to be together forever and ever. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for him even if it was giving my life or taking a bullet for him. I know that many people say that a Capricorn is cold and unfeeling but I feel that when we fall in love we are totally devoted to this love we feel. I know his favorite food, I know his favorite snack, I know how he likes his coffee and the brand of coffee he likes. I will never forget Nestlé dolce coffee. I dream of a white house with flowers and peace. Me and him together living our life next to each other and the other with two children a beautiful and cute family. I don’t know anyone’s birthday but my siblings, my own and a cousin. However, I don’t forget his day. I had doubts at the beginning if what I felt was love or if I was in love with him in the end I think it was just my fears because he only needs to take my heart and give it to him. There is nothing I would not do for him and there is nothing I want in this life if it is not with him.",3,1731774273.0,love,2,0.81,False

Moreso, the inaction of LGUs (brgy.'s) in effectively capturing and punishing such criminals. 

Last night (Nov. 15, Fri.) my cousin (F19) and her boyfriend (M19) went to a nearby coffee shop—Broo. Tea and Coffee. Prior to that, as they got off the jeep, three people—who are assumed to identify as homosexuals—began to follow them inconspicuously. Quite evidently, it appears that the snatchers were struggling to make a grab for the devices at her boyfriend's pocket while they were walking side-by-side.

It was only as they were entering the aforementioned shop when the pickpockets were able to discreetly grab my cousin's phone. It happened around 6:18 PM and CCTV footage was already obtained from the staff of the shop. The same night, they also brought the case to the attention of the local barangay's. 

Although, the exact location of her iPhone cannot be pinpointed; We are aware it's nearby the area/neighborhood. 

They tried asking around again during this afternoon (Nov. 16, Sat.), and only happened to retrieve information about the snatcher's alias—'Cardo'—and apparent history in being jailed.  

They're both college students, and personally, I'm grateful the pickpockets didn't pose any threats in harming them. Nevertheless, they're both shaken up by the incident. 

Their case is far from the first of their sindicates. Numerous reports had been filed for the same reasons. 

Any recommendations, apart from holding phones/keeping bags at the front, from preventing and, effectively, reacting in these type of situations? Especially for students. 

And, what, why, and where do you think pickpockets take the stolen goods? To a pawn shop, to their boss, or to hack? ",1,1731774224.0,Philippines,2,0.6,False

I used to eat about once or twice a day but all at different times so it's been challenging sticking to a window which leads me to my actual question, is it normal to be reaaaaally hungry during that eating window? I eat about three or four times now, small to medium portions but it never feels enough. Whenever I eat anything I'm hungry again in like an hour or two. Is it a portion issue maybe? 

I'm also fairly active, I go to the gym 4 times a week 2 of those are in the morning during my fasting period and they're cardio classes but I always feel fine before, during & after these but maybe something's happening in my body in the background that's maybe not so good.

I’m not so sure I could’ve memorized it correctly but I wanted to document this as soon as possible.

I was living my normal day to day life, except this time it was on some different island. I remember the dream starting off with a volcano or something erupting every five minutes and projecting in different directions. I had ran to the shore of the beach and jumped into the water and nothing bad happened to me, then I saw that there was a bunch of underwater housing, it was like a whole village,, then there was a time shift and suddenly there were people there, there were houses near the water and me and my mom were living there. Then another time shift and it was night and I decided to go underwater and found a whole bunch of people living underwater in that village. The houses were made of some sort of sand stone and they were reconstructing them after the volcano had hit, surprisingly I stayed underwater for a long time and explored the village and there were stores like Barnes and nobles for some reason and underwater coffee shops and houses with tiny beds. I think air some reason when I went into the water I shrunk and also I was able to breathe underwater? It was so strange. I was able to keep my eyes open underwater for some reason too. I got out of the water and went to my mom and questioned about it and she told me that it was brackish water cause for some reason in the dream I feared of getting a brain eating amoeba. There was a little shore were I found these weird sea slugs and gooey fishes. 

I know this dream probably has no meaning but this morning when I woke up I was gasping for air. I don’t know why. ",1,1731773940.0,Dream,0,1.0,False

Made a friend last week at a trans community meeting. We talked for a good couple of hours, then she asked for my number. Pretty quickly over text I had suggested we meet up for coffee, but then our morning schedules didn’t line up for the next week, so I suggested drinks instead. She agreed. 

My brain was then like, “Hey dumbass… She was really pretty, and she said she was gay. Is this a date??”

And I was like, “UHHHHH idk???? Maybe????” I was just excited to have a new friend tbh, but that didn’t stop me from playing Chappell Roan on repeat the entire week (just in case!!)

Fast forward to yesterday, before leaving. I am showing outfits to my (gay, male) housemate with the question, “which one of these says, ‘I am here for friendship, but I am also Totally Down if you’re interested’?” He talked me down from a dress to a nice blouse and pants. 

My new friend and I get to the bar, and she is SO PRETTY. We barely skipped a beat in 4 hours of conversation. After 3 of those hours, I finally worked up the courage to ask if she was single — she is. I mentioned I was too. She took a pause, then asked, “So… Is this, like, a date…? I’ve been trying to figure this out all week lol”

I fessed up that I wasn’t originally planning for it to be a date, but I did find her to be very attractive (essentially everything I’ve written in this post, but like in a *suave* way that *totally didn’t* reveal my inner gay panic lol). She told me she felt the same, and we determined that this was, in fact, a first date that was going VERY well.

She agreed. 

I drove an hour to her area and we met for coffee. The conversation flowed well. We have different work backgrounds and interests. She’s more left-brained, I’m the opposite. She thanked me for the time and hinted at a second date. I said I’d check my calendar and we could set something up. 

Here’s the part I just don’t get with texting. 

When I got home, she’d sent a note thanking me and wished a safe drive. I promptly thanked her and asked what day she’s free later in the coming week. 

No response until the following afternoon, of “Sounds good. How’s your day going?” I waited a short while to reply, to avoid seeming needy or aggressive, then suggested where we could meet and how my day went. No response for hours, but then she answered that night with questions about my interests in addition to agreeing to the second date place. 

I answered her questions within a couple hours, and offered a specific time to meet. No response since then (last night). 

Is this bread crumbing? Laziness? Why do some people just not respond timely out of respect for another’s schedule or effort?

Edit for clarification: I don’t spend my day constantly checking my phone and I’m not a big text person.

Long story short, a non-native English speaking (did not know at the time) professional networking contact reached out to me via LinkedIn and wanted to connect. I met him in person for coffee to see how the connection would go. The communication barrier was challenging because he had a very strong accent. I am convinced that if it were not for the fact I am half Korean and grew up with broken English speaking relatives (my mom included) that I would not have been able to follow the conversation effectively enough.

Towards the end of our conversation he was asking for my advice. We work in data and analytics and he was sharing he’s going to continue to work on his coding. I told him his tech skills are fine - I have no doubts you couldn’t crush it in any job - and that it’s his communication he needs to work on. I essentially alluded to his accent (which I have mixed feelings about), pacing, and general Q&A/interviewing flow. 

He took the feedback with grace and I promised to help him mock interview where I will try to pepper in more tidbits of communication feedback (not that I am an expert).
