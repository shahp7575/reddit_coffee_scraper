1ifskhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1ifskhr/entitled_mothergrandmother_calls_her_son_her/,Entitled Mother/grandmother calls her son her greatest disappointment,"Hi everyone.

Yesterday was my husband‚Äôs 30th birthday, and he received this wonderful letter from his mother. I‚Äôm not sure if this fits here, but I just had to Share it.

Background: My mother-in-law doesn‚Äôt get along with her sister. They live in the same town. His aunt is almost like a mother figure to my husband and has always been there for him.

For his aunt‚Äôs 60th birthday, we were invited and decided to go. My mother-in-law was also invited but couldn‚Äôt make it. That evening, she sent a message saying we should be ashamed for celebrating without her.

She then wrote to us directly, saying that she‚Äôs better off without family and that we shouldn‚Äôt visit her.

After that, we only had sporadic contact with her on birthdays and holidays‚Äîbut only via WhatsApp.

This is the letter we got from her:

I gave birth to you in pain. 

I sang you songs and read you stories. 

I played with you on the floor for years. 

I took care of you when you were sick. 

I gave you the biggest room in the apartment because that‚Äôs what you wanted. 

I organized your birthday parties for you and your friends. 

I supported you in judo and drove you to competitions. 

I moved for you because you wanted to go to secondary school with your friends. 

I always drove you to your grandmother. 

I made it possible for you to stay in touch with your family. 

I practiced driving with you. 


I gave you my car when you turned 18. 

I made it possible for you to have a graduation party. 

I gave up my job and career because of you. 

I couldn‚Äôt work full-time because even at 13, you were still unreliable.

You were never an easy child. Always angry and always arguing. Instead of getting things done, you just debated. You never helped me with even the smallest household tasks. You played your father and me against each other. (Note: His parents separated when he was 8.) You drained me emotionally. I tried to teach you values like honor, pride, helpfulness, and loyalty. You took none of it with you.

I came to visit you every month after your daughter was born. Not once did you visit me. (Note: The child was born in May and hated car rides. In December, we finally made our first trip to the mother-in-law, which was three hours away‚Äîbut by then, you had already cut off contact.) Whenever I visited, I brought cake and coffee for myself because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be offered anything at your place. Every time I was there, your wife didn‚Äôt feel well and withdrew. I never truly felt welcome with you, despite always having shown you hospitality.

Your father was always ashamed of his parents‚Äô home, but he still honored them with respect and dignity. You have neither. Instead, you treat me like dirt. You have completely failed as a son‚Äîand as a father, too, because you have taken my granddaughter away from her grandmother. You chose money over character.

If I hadn‚Äôt had a child, I could have had a career and made a lot of money. Have you ever thought about that? I am proud of what I have achieved‚Äîalone! I would have loved to have a son I could be proud of‚Ä¶ but you can‚Äôt choose your family. You are the greatest disappointment of my life. You have broken my heart.

I won‚Äôt sign this because I don‚Äôt know how. Apparently, you no longer want a mother.

TLDR; My mother-in-law blames us for the contact break that she initiated herself and calls her son the greatest disappointment of her life.

My sister (23F) asked to borrow my car for the weekend because hers is in the shop. Normally, I‚Äôd say yes, but the last time she borrowed it, she returned it with a massive scratch along the side, the interior was a disaster (think empty fast food bags, coffee spills, and mud everywhere), and she didn‚Äôt even bother to clean it. She apologized but never offered to cover the $300+ it cost me to fix the scratch and deep-clean the car.

This time, I said no. I told her I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable lending her my car again after what happened last time. She got super upset, called me selfish, and said I was overreacting because ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a car.‚Äù She even brought up how family should help each other out no matter what. Now my parents are involved, and they‚Äôre siding with her, saying I should give her another chance because ‚Äúeveryone makes mistakes.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm torn: I feel like I‚Äôm being reasonable by setting boundaries, but my family is making me feel like I‚Äôm being overly harsh. I get that family is important, but I also feel like she needs to take responsibility for her actions. Plus, my car is my responsibility, and I can‚Äôt afford to keep fixing it every time she borrows it.

So, Reddit, AITA for refusing to let my sister borrow my car again? Should I just suck it up and let her use it, or am I right to stand my ground? I need some honest opinions here because this is causing a lot of tension in my family.",2,1738483347.0,AmItheAsshole,8,0.75,False

I used to sleep 7-9 hours a night, and then one day my body decided half that amount was fine.

I usually wake up due to needing the bathroom, and this is even when I go before bed and don't drink a lot before bed. Then I can't get back to sleep. I'll be tired all day and then after dinner, I'll go back to bed for another 2-4 hours. I don't usually have issues falling asleep. It's the staying asleep that is a problem. Even on days off when I have nowhere to be, I do this.

I thought maybe it was due to needing my thyroid medication adjusted because insomnia was one of my symptoms prior to treatment, but I still have this issue at my new dose.

Melatonin, Benadryl and ZZZquil do not work, but I can also drink coffee and then go to sleep. I only have one cup of coffee per day and it's always in the morning. Breathing exercises not only do not help, but they keep me awake because I overthink them. The 4-7-8 method doesn't do a thing for me. I used to sleep awesome when I first took amitriptyline for tension headaches, but then the sleep side effects disappeared, as did its effect on my headaches.

I've also tried toughing it out and not napping to ensure I'm good and tired by bedtime. I may fall asleep super quick, but I'm still up and about in 3-4 hours.

I remember one time in all of 2024, by some miracle, I slept a full eight hours. I did nothing different that night, and three hours later, I was so bloody exhausted as if I hadn't slept at all. I'm talking going cross eyed, nodding off, the whole nine yards. It's like a full night's sleep is oversleeping for me now.

Sleeping in other positions doesn't help either because for whatever reason, I can only sleep on my stomach with my legs in a particular position and my arms in a particular position. Anything else and I'm not sleeping.

Stuff like fans and ambient noise don't help either because my ideal sleeping atmosphere is dead silent and pitch black. Like I will turn my digital clock face down so I don't see the red glow. I also have eclipse curtains. Weighted blankets made me feel like I was being crushed and kept me awake, so that was a waste. I didn't even get a super heavy one - I think I got a 12-pound one.

I might get a sleep oxygen monitor to see if anything is amiss in that regard, but I really don't have any other symptoms of sleep apnea, so I don't think that's the issue to begin with. But it won't hurt to rule it out.

No idea what to do at this point! I can certainly function on 3-4 hours of sleep and I'm good for probably 10-11 hours if I have coffee.",2,1738482960.0,sleep,2,1.0,False

Garrison: Engine? What the hell do we need engines for? This is AMERICA! We fly on freedom!

[Suddenly, alarms blare. The plane tilts violently. Passengers scream in the background.]

Garrison (laughing): Look at this! I‚Äôm making aviation great again!

[Cut to the passenger cabin. Chaos. A man clutches his armrests.]

Passenger: Oh my God, we‚Äôre gonna die!

[Randy Marsh, sitting casually, sips his drink.]

Randy: Eh, we‚Äôve survived worse. Remember when Amazon took over South Park?

[Back in the cockpit. The plane is spiraling.]

Secret Service Agent: Sir, you have to let the pilots take over!

Garrison: Nope! I‚Äôm pulling a patriot move! Time to drain the sky swamp!

[Garrison yanks a lever. The plane does a full barrel roll. Everyone screams. A bald eagle appears outside the window, saluting before getting sucked into an engine.]

Co-Pilot: That was our last engine!

Garrison: Fake news! I‚Äôve got this under control!

[Cut to the ground. The plane is coming in HOT toward South Park Elementary. Cut to Cartman on the playground, eating Cheesy Poofs.]

I've been struggling with channeling/spraying. I THINK I'm doing all the things to mitigate channeling, and yet it's still happening. Every. Time. 

I'm starting to suspect it's (mostly) the beans, since the problem has become consistently bad since I bought them (Sisters Coffee Co. Familia Villatoro Guatemala, medium roast, 1400-1900 MASL altitude, roasted 13 January 2025....they seem very dry). But it might (probably) also be me; help me identify possible problems with my prep:

Using stock Lelit IMS 14-18g basket, typical recipe 15:30-32(aiming for 30 until I defeat spray). Adjusting grind settings one or two each way is varying shot time from 22-26 seconds (from time pump is switched on). I've adjusted grind to get shot time to 32 seconds, but with that shot time it starts with dark, dribbling drips, then from about 10-14 seconds, rapidly turns from dark to a flood of pale, under-extracted liquid. Which I believe is channeling, correct?

My prep: spritz unground beans with two spritzes of water, shake, then two more, then more shaking. Grind, empty into portafilter with dosing collar, then do WDT (.4mm needles; I try to do it Lance-Hedrick style but I've experimented with different techniques, producing generally similar results). Make the fluffy level and smoothish, tamp with Normcore self-leveling tamper with a 30lb spring until it's fully depressed, carefully drop a puck screen in, place the portafilter whilst taking care not to bump it on the group head, set up the scale and cup, and flip the switch. 

Attached are photos (EDIT: photos didn't show up and I couldn't add them), along with this clip of my last shot: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x1U-VVQDEoE . I've only pulled shots with three different coffees: 1 medium dark roast with a bit of oil, Stumptown Hair Bender (medium), and my current coffee (also medium). Both this and the Hair Bender end up with husk fragments, and it seems to me that these fragments may be promoting channeling. The medium-dark roast I used was my first stab at this, and there was almost no channeling ever. My shots looked a lot like the ones you see in advertisements. But the other two coffees have a lot of husk fragments (esp. the Hair Bender). Also these Guatemala beans, after roasting, are by far the driest texture of the three. Could they be too dry for espresso?

Lastly, note the scratches on the inside of the basket. I can't tell if they're from the puck screen or the tamper, but it makes me wonder if I should try for a slightly higher dosage in case I'm possibly bottoming one of them out. The Anna is a 57mm portafilter machine, so 15g *seemed* about as much as I could use without touching the shower screen.

However, the most alarming symptom I noticed is that my tongue was coated with some kind of brown biofilm that I couldn't really scrape / brush away. Other than being COVID-negative, my primary care didn't know what was going on; she prescribed a Z-pack and Stahist AD for a few days and I generally stopped feeling ""sick"" within a week or so. 

I didn't feel great over the next month though - postnasal drip / fatigue continued to linger and my tongue remained coated, though more white rather than brown. One weekend these symptoms got a little worse and the tongue started to turn brown again, so I went to an urgent care where I was presecribed Nystatin for thrush. I was on it for 2 weeks or so, didn't work. Went back to primary care, ran a Mono test (negative) and took blood - my iron levels were high (example: iron saturation was at 77%). She referred me to a GE; I started feeling better over the few weeks leading up, tongue was white again. The GE was more interested in my iron levels, not very interested in the tongue - he ran tests for hemochromatosis, all negative. My iron was re-tested a few weeks ago and everything is now in normal range (without action), so it's unclear what role this has played in how I've been feeling. My dentist also looked at my tongue and wasn't concerned, but recommended Peroxyl mouthwash.

My tongue has been coated white for months now, particularly towards the back (it looks pretty gross if you shine a light) - additionally, the V-shaped row of bumps there seem red and enlarged. A ""lump in throat"" feeling also persists, some days worse than others and often worse after eating. I generally just haven't felt right since that initial illness - I saw an ENT for all of this at the end of December and was diagnosed with GERD symptoms, also noting some mild tonsil inflammation; I've now been on omeprazole for a month with no results (I follow up later this month). I brought this up with the GE while discussing my latest iron results; he would've expected omeprazole to work by now, but recommended sticking with it until the ENT follow-up. Unless I suddenly start seeing results with omeprazole, it feels like I've been waiting for months between doctor's appointments to no avail. I regularly do everything I've seen online:

* Tongue scraping (helps a little, can't completely remove and comes back easily)
* Mouthwash / toothpastes (might help? not for long though): Peroxyl, Biotene
* Probiotic supplements
* Reducing coffee / tea

Given the odd timeline and symptoms, I can't help but feel this may not just be acid reflux and I'd like to at least have some possibilities to discuss with my doctors - does any of this sound familiar? I've considered the possibility of an STD as I had two sexual encounters 2-4 weeks before falling ill (gave oral sex once, received it another), but I feel like my symptoms would be more obvious based on what I see online. Another thought is my vaping habits; I regularly vape cannabis and occasionally THC carts. I've begun to cut down on this to see if it helps, though I took a month-long break back in the fall and noticed no difference. My only other guess would be some kind of infection (from what I understand H. Pylori can cause a coated tongue?).

Today I was listening to a song written by Laufey called: ""Dear Soulmate"" which goes like this:

\[...\]

Dear soulmate  
Do you think of me? 'Cause I do  
Do you have green eyes? Or are they brown like mine?  
Do you have a sister too?  
Dear soulmate  
One day I'll give this song to you

\[...\]

Do you sleep on the right side?  
'Cause I prefer the left  
Will you make me butter toast?  
Perhaps a morning roast  
When I wake up and I'm sad?

\[...\]

Dear soulmate  
I can't wait to fall in love with you!

It's indeed beautiful and wanted to share some of its lyrics with you all. 

Okay, here we go.  
I am a heteroromantic asexual girl who is open to making like-minded friends from anywhere! I'm currently 20 and will soon turn 21. I'm a student, and I live with my lovely family (there are six of us). Oh, I forgot to mention‚ÄîI am from South America. Besides that, I'm someone who is always dreaming awake. I'm naturally very shy, and I usually stay at home, even though I also love being outdoors. I enjoy going for long walks, wandering in forests, going for coffee, and mostly doing chill stuff.

I consider myself a kind person who enjoys listening to others. I am extremely sensitive, which might not be ideal for some people. My family says I am caring, trustworthy, and, most of the time, adorable (though I am not sure about this last one). I fancy classical music, writing my thoughts, having meaningful connections, and exploring other people's perspectives because each one of them is like a window offering limitless landscapes with their own colors. And I find that fascinating.

I am the kind of girl who lives in her mind most of the time. I love romanticism in its purest form‚Äîthe kind of innocent love kids have. If I ever find my soulmate, I would love to daydream together, match cute/funny outfits, have coffee together every day, and be best friends‚Äîsomeone I could enjoy stargazing with. Maybe someone to talk about deep topics like the meaning of life (?) or to watch silly videos and laugh together, to travel the world holding hands everywhere, and just love each other until the end of the world, if that makes sense... Someone to build dreams with. And like Laufey says in one of her songs (""Like the Movies""):

*""I want a love like I've seen in the movies,*  
*(Maybe) that's why I'll never fall in love.""*

Oookay, there was so much more that I wanted to say, but this is already too long, so here's my additional information:

* I'm such a funny size (4'11""), and I love that! (And I'm slim.)
* I have messy curly hair.
* Brown eyes.

I love the idea of making friends from other cultures, getting to know them, and sharing interesting conversations. So, please feel free to message me if you think we would get along! I just want to meet kind souls.

I wish you all a lovely day!

I (32M) might have a hereditary genetic disease. Do I meet with her?,"This is a long and complicated story, and I‚Äôm still trying to process everything. I‚Äôd really appreciate some advice.

Back in 2019, I was traveling abroad when I met my ex. We got together, and I ended up moving to her country for my master‚Äôs degree. It turned out to be the worst relationship of my life. I was emotionally and verbally abusive; she was physically abusive. We were toxic in every way possible.

I wanted out, but then she got pregnant. This was shocking because, by that point, I had basically stopped sleeping with her‚Äîexcept once, on my birthday. She denied cheating, but I had doubts. She struggled with serious mental health issues (self-harm, suicidal thoughts), and I suspected she had BPD. The last thing I wanted was a child with her, so I pressured her into having an abortion.

After that, I broke up with her, graduated, and cut all contact. That was in March 2021. I blocked her on everything and told her if she ever reached out again, I‚Äôd call the police. I genuinely believed we were both terrible for each other and needed to stay apart.

Fast forward to March 2022, she emailed me‚Äîout of nowhere‚Äîabout our pet fish dying. We met for coffee, and things were surprisingly fine. She was seeing someone new, I was dating as well, and we were civil.

Then in early 2023, my best friend from the military took his own life. It destroyed me. I spiraled into alcohol and drug use to cope. Around the same time, my ex randomly started reaching out again. She was engaged to a guy who seemed like a great person‚Äîstable, well-off, loved her deeply, even bought them a house.

She admitted that after the abortion, something inside her changed. She didn‚Äôt feel things the same way anymore. She convinced her fianc√© they should have kids, but she had two miscarriages. She was devastated.

I always felt guilt over the abortion‚Äînot for breaking up with her, but for not respecting the possibility of life. So, in one of the worst decisions I‚Äôve ever made, I offered to get her pregnant so she could raise the baby with her fianc√©. We agreed that if she got pregnant, she‚Äôd cut all contact with me forever, and I would watch from a distance. She asked if I‚Äôd ever want to meet the child. I said no, it was too risky. She left her Instagram public so I could watch from afar.

We had sex several times over a couple of months. Meanwhile, my substance abuse got even worse. I was battling constant anxiety‚Äîmourning my friend, realizing I was falling in love with my ex again, and grappling with what I was doing.

Then in April 2023, she messaged me: pregnancy confirmed.

She blocked me on everything. I fell into a full-blown crisis, left my job, and got into therapy. Over time, I pulled myself together, moved to another country for work, and got my life back on track.

Here‚Äôs where things get even worse.

In December 2024, I went home for a funeral and found out my family had been hiding something from me for years: Huntington‚Äôs disease runs in my family, and my mom has it. There‚Äôs a 50% chance I have it too. I still need to get tested.

Then, while I‚Äôm home, my ex adds me on Instagram. I see her, her husband, and a child. I don‚Äôt know for sure if it‚Äôs mine. I don‚Äôt message her.

Now, in February 2025, she DMs me. She wants to grab coffee when I‚Äôm in her city in March.

I don‚Äôt know what she wants to talk about. I don‚Äôt know if the child is mine. I don‚Äôt know if I have Huntington‚Äôs. But I do know that opening this door could blow up her life, my life, and this kid‚Äôs life.

How do I navigate this situation? I don‚Äôt have time to get tested before meeting her. Do I block her and not meet with her? Do I ask for a paternity test? I wouldn‚Äôt tell her about the Huntingtons until I confirm I have it. ",4,1738480775.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

When you've got a magical box that can spit out answers to any question you throw at it, why bother using your own brain? It's like having a personal cheat code for life. They're sacrificing their critical thinking skills on the altar of convenience.

These AI chatbots are nothing more than glorified parrots, regurgitating pre-digested information without any real understanding or context. They're not teaching people how to think; they're teaching people how to regurgitate meaningless facts and figures like a bunch of mindless robots. And we're wonder why the average IQ is plummeting? It's because we're no longer challenging ourselves to think critically; we're just relying on some soulless machine to do all the heavy lifting for us.

And don't even get me started on the so-called ""education"" system that's embracing this crap with open arms. Teachers are using these chatbots as a crutch, letting them do all the work while they sit back and collect a paycheck. It's like they're saying, ""Hey kids, don't bother learning how to think for yourselves; just use this fancy AI tool and you'll be golden!"" What a load of horseshit.

The result is a generation of people who can't even begin to comprehend complex ideas or arguments. They're stuck in a world of simplistic soundbites and binary thinking, where nuance and subtlety are lost on them. They're being trained to respond to stimuli like Pavlov's dogs, without any real understanding of what they're doing or why.

And what's worse is that these AI-powered chatbots are creating a culture of dependency. People are becoming so reliant on them that they can't even function without them. It's like they're addicted to some kind of digital heroin, and they can't get enough of that sweet, sweet dopamine hit that comes with getting an instant answer to their every question.

But here's the thing: critical thinking is not just some optional skill that you can pick up or leave behind; it's essential for survival in this crazy world. Without it, we're nothing more than helpless sheep waiting to be slaughtered by the wolves of propaganda and manipulation. We need people who can think for themselves, who can analyze information and make informed decisions based on evidence and reason.

So yeah, I'm calling out all you ChatGPT-loving fuckwits out there: wake up and smell the coffee! You're not making your lives easier by relying on these AI chatbots; you're making yourselves dumber. You're sacrificing your intellectual autonomy on the altar of convenience, and it's going to come back to haunt you in ways you never thought possible.

It's time to take back our brains from these soulless machines and start thinking for ourselves again. We need to reject this culture of dependency and start challenging ourselves to be better thinkers. So put down your phone  -  step away from the screen -  go read a book  - engage   conversation with human being - anything really.

I combine it with tea tree oil and sometimes with lemon balm.

I also use a seb derm shampoo for a week now. But i still have scalp itch, i see zero difference so far.. 

I have cut gluten also this week and i am vegan for 10+ years.

If it's stress related i guess there is so solution tho.. I also have mouth ulcers, anus and genital itch, eye eczema.. All the good things! Probably a combinations of skin diseases, but not confirmed by doctors. They are on and off for cycles each year, but this time, especially the under nose redness+itch is over a year!!

One doc said it's cold sore, maybe i had back then, but from photos looks like seb derm. 

Only thing that work is elidel on eyes for eczema. All the other areas are itchy. Tea tree can offer some comfort.

Next step is to eliminate nutritional yeast and the tomatoes. 

Is it possible to have a swab exam without wounds? For example under the nose area on scalp? Can a blood test show something? Allergy tests for everything ( food and contact ) are very expensive!

It feels like every coffee shop is owned by the same few companies (Kimly) and every stall is just a repeat of the same few chains (Tenderbest, King of Fried Rice etc).

The same goes for the newer hawker centres like One Punggol or Anchorvale Village, where you'll see quite a few duplicate stalls (Munchi Pancakes, Eng Kee Chicken Wings etc) no matter which hawker centre you go to.

It just feels kind of sad to see the last generation of hawkers slowly close down with no one to carry the torch, and all we have left would be only chain outlets charging a premium for less authentic food

For example I was thinking about my process and mindset for when I have fed up moments and want to get my life together. Does the below not sound like basically every movie?

1. Feel rock bottom or thereabouts. Feel miserable and basically become a sloth in bed. 
2. Have a MOMENT! where I need to change my life 
3. Write down what I need to change in a notebook or in my phone and my goals etc 
4. Decide how I will reinvent myself and what must change (because unlike the movies I don‚Äôt go out and chop half my hair off or get a full wardrobe makeover) 
5. Focus on self care moments eg face masks and giving myself a manicure and reading self help books and lighting candles and having everything showers
6. Throw everything out and clean and tidy and change my space, even if it‚Äôs just a slight change, and make lists for how I can make it better eg new bedding or a piece of art or a new shelf. Lots of music and dancing about as I clean and tidy (though I don‚Äôt look *anywhere near* as cute doing this as the actresses - let‚Äôs be real)

I mean‚Ä¶ ??? I think this is just life though. But I feel like I need to perhaps stop my subconscious from wanting me to be Elle Woods. Anyway it‚Äôs not the worst thing, my issue is sticking with things -_- 

I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm a lot better at enjoying the small parts of life. I think I‚Äôve always been quite good at it, maybe? Perhaps not. But it comes naturally which is surprising given what a worrier negative Nelly I am. Anyway I like it and I intend to continue. I was thinking about it earlier this morning with my coffee and thinking this is delicious and a moment to myself (lolllllll from what? Overbearing husband? Kids? No work life balance? Huge social calendar? K sure girl) but still. And just enjoying it. Or watering my plants and just taking time to enjoy them and prune them a little and think about how they grew from such tiny little things to big plants all because I put love and time and patience into them. And it made me think of my process for myself and giving myself the same. And idk. These aren‚Äôt good examples but my mind is slowly switching off so it‚Äôll do. 

I cleaned so much today again! Today I tackled my bathrooms and more laundry. I‚Ä¶

* Cleaned the shower 
* Cleaned the bathtub
* Cleaned the shower caddy thingy and my products 
* Cleaned the basin
* Cleaned the loo and loo brush 
* Cleaned all the windowsills and ledges
* Cleaned all the door handles and other bits 
* Vacuumed
* Cleaned the drains 
* Emptied the bins
* Cleaned the windows 
* Swapped out my bath mats and hand towel 
* Refreshed my diffuser & popped a new candle in there (it smells so good in my bathroom now??) 
* Washed the walls with spray and a cloth 
* Dusted and cleaned and burned in my candles a bit 
* Did more laundry incl all the cleaning cloths

And then I also worked on my diary which I will be using as a tracker. I can‚Äôt find a set of pencils in one colour anywhere?? Hm. And then otherwise I just relaxed and stuff. 

I had no right losing it the way I did to life is a highway while cleaning up my cleaning bits earlier. Anyone would think I was filming a music video at full intensity. I love being home alone. 

My space feels so clean and tidy and nice. It makes me feel really good.  

I‚Äôve been kind of nauseous this afternoon on and off :( Idk why. Anxiety? It‚Äôs not bad or anything but I just feel kind of iffy. 

Animated movies make some of the best songs. That Le festin one from ratatouille? I listened to it on repeat while making dinner before. It‚Äôs so nice. I love ratatouille, I think it‚Äôs one of my favourite movies. Maybe. Certainly up there. I just never get sick of it. Anyway. I love everyone who makes animated movies. I love animated things. I know everyone does, I suppose it just makes you feel safe and nostalgic and comfy? It takes me out of my thoughts more than any other kind of movie I think, and that‚Äôs something that affects how I enjoy something. Eg a movie with ten thousand beautiful women will get me in my head about my own looks, but a movie about a cartoon rat making some soup? Zoned out entirely. It‚Äôs a nice break, I guess. Anyway. 

I get to spend time with my handsome man tonight :) I love him so much. He‚Äôs not had the best day, I hope it turned around for him. He only deserves good things. He‚Äôs so wonderful. So utterly wonderful. 

My shower was nice, my bathroom smells so good?! I think it‚Äôs the diffuser and candle combo, plus the spray I use on the basin smells kinda nice - for a spray anyway. 

I had one day with only one antihistamine not two and my eyes already feel questionable again. I wonder if it‚Äôs the milk? Hm.

Apparently, the suspect took couple of additional steps in this already circuitous route. Plus, I've added the leg down to Penn Station. I've included maps with estimated times below in and in the replies.

I was alerted to these additional steps by two reddit posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeLuigi/comments/1iciun0/new_video_theyre_wearing_a_medical_face_mask_here/)¬†and¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrianThompsonMurder/comments/1iciqcl/am_i_the_only_one_who_hasnt_seen_this_video_of/)) that have brought to everyone's attention the fact that we previously overlooked a video that allegedly shows the suspect walking north past the Hilltop Pharmacy at 593 Fort Washington Avenue, just south of 187th Street:

As discussed in this¬†[NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/nyregion/uhc-shooting-gunman-getaway-bike.html), according to NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny, this video was taken AFTER the alleged sighting of the suspect, approximately at 7:30AM, at the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal. (The authorities have provided no images or video for that alleged 7:30AM sighting.) Here's a quote from the NYT article:

""Initially, investigators theorized that the man who shot Mr. Thompson had left New York on a bus from a terminal in Washington Heights. Cameras captured the man entering the bus depot on West 178th Street at about 7:30 a.m., but not leaving.

After fleeing Midtown on the bike in the early morning, the gunman hailed a cab at 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and traveled to the bus station, paying the fare in cash.

But surveillance camera footage reviewed more recently by investigators showed him leaving the bus depot by subway.¬†*The gunman walked from the bus terminal to the 190th Street station, and from there he took the A train downtown train downtown to Pennsylvania Station, police said. A camera in a subway elevator captured his movements, Chief Kenny said*¬†\[emphasis added\].‚Äù

There are a few problems with the Hilltop Pharmacy video and Chief Kenny's statement.

**First problem**: The Hilltop Pharmacy video has no date/timestamp. It's therefore possible this video was taken¬†*BEFORE*¬†the alleged 7:30AM sighting at the Bus Terminal. If so, it would destroy LE's timeline. As shown in the map below, it takes at least \~21 minutes to walk from the suspect's prior alleged location (2372 Amsterdam Avenue, between 177th and 178th Streets) to this new alleged location (the Hilltop Pharmacy at 593 Fort Washington Avenue). (I say ""at least,"" because in the photo of Taxi Guy walking outside the taxi at 2372 Amsterdam, he's headed south, toward 177th Street, so he was headed in the¬†*opposite*¬†direction of both the Bus Terminal and the Hilltop Pharmacy.) It takes another 10 minutes to walk from 593 Fort Washington Avenue back down to the Bus Terminal. (See map in the first reply.) That would add 31 minutes to the total journey from the point where the suspect allegedly caught the cab at \~7:04AM (86th Street and Columbus) to the Bus Terminal, where he was allegedly sighted at \~7:30AM. Previously, I had used Google Maps to estimate this journey at \~27 minutes (giving LE a huge benefit of the doubt by refraining from taking rush-hour traffic into account). But with these two extra steps (to get up to the Hilltop Pharmacy and back), you'd need to add \~31 minutes to the original \~27 minutes, for a total of \~58 minutes. He would've arrived at the Bus Terminal at \~8:02AM. Impossible to get there by 7:30AM. Timeline, bye.

But, despite the lack of a date/timestamp, let's give Chief Kenny the benefit of the doubt, and grant him that the Hilltop video was taken¬†*AFTER*¬†7:30AM. As shown in the same map in the first reply below, it takes approximately 10 minutes to walk from the Bus Terminal to the Hilltop Pharmacy (same amount of time to walk in either direction), so the suspect would've been caught on video there at \~7:40AM. (I've used terrain maps here, because this area is definitely the ""heights"" part of Washington Heights, very hilly, and although this shouldn't affect Google's time estimates, it may come up later and it's probably a good fact to bear in mind.)

Anyway, according to Kenny, the suspect continued walking north another few blocks to the 190th Street Subway Station. As shown in the map below, the entire trip from the Bus Terminal to the 190th Street Subway Station would take approximately 17 minutes, so he would've arrived at \~7:47AM. (In an odd quirk of NYC geography, the 190th Street Subway Station is located about four blocks north of 190th Street and Fort Washington Avenue, at the equivalent of \~194th Street. The cross streets stop at 190th Street on Fort Washington Avenue, probably because the terrain is so hilly. Also, Google Maps doesn't recognize the subway station as a location, and the closest address I could find to input into Google Maps was 735 Fort Washington Avenue, which is maybe 20-30 yards north of the subway station. Using the exact longitude/latitude for the subway station yields the same 17-minute estimate, but results in Google converting the displayed address to ""190 St, Bennett Ave, New York, NY 10040,"" which I think could be confusing, because Bennett Avenue is a block further east of Fort Washington Avenue. Anyway, see the map in the reply below for this 17-minute estimate.)

Next, according to Kenny, at the 190th Street Station, the suspect rode the elevator down to the platform and took an A Train down to Penn Station. Google Maps estimated travel time on the A Train on a Wednesday as 26 minutes. (See map in the reply below.) He arrived at \~7:47AM. Let's say he had to wait 10 minutes for a train to arrive. That puts him in Penn Station about 36 minutes later, at \~8:23AM.

This brings us to the¬†**second problem**. A couple of people on reddit ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrianThompsonMurder/comments/1id0m46/the_route_he_took_after_the_shooting_is_frying_me/)) have said that the 190th Street Subway Station has been closed for more than a year. I haven't been able to verify that information, but¬†[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/190th_Street_station)¬†says that the elevators that lead from the station's stone head house (see photo in the replies) to the platform were taken out of service in 2020, that construction was supposed to be completed in 2021, and that it was pushed back due to delays. (Lol, looking into it also led me into a fascinating historical rabbit hole about the this colorful and atmospheric station, and the local-politics foofaraws in which the residents battled valiantly to have the fares removed from elevators, so that they could use them even when not taking the subway, to avoiding walking up an eight-story hill. They eventually won in 1957. I'll post an evocative photo of the Art Deco lighted ""SUBWAY"" sign above the staircase leading from Fort Washington Avenue down to the platform where you can get the elevator.) Anyway, if this subway station was indeed closed, then the suspect couldn't have used it to take the A Train down to Penn Station. And note that Kenny specifically said that ""A camera¬†*in a subway elevator*¬†captured his movements.""

A¬†**third problem**¬†is that, in walking to the 190th Street Subway Station, the suspect would've walked right past the 181st Street Subway Station. Both the 190th Street Station and the 181st Street Station are local stations on the A Train. Google estimates the trip from 181 Street as the same 26 minutes as the trip from 190th Street (see map below). So, he would've walked another nine blocks north, just to go to a totally fungible local subway station, and then add that same nine blocks of distance to his subway trip back down south to Penn Station. (When any New Yorker can tell you about the constant dread of subway trains stopping between stations for no reason at any time, and how you therefore never want to add even two inches to your subway trip.) WHY would he DO that?

A¬†**fourth problem**¬†is that this new video greatly exacerbates the original problem that this route is illogically circuitous, lengthy, and exposed to cameras. Many people on reddit are now claiming that the suspect was serpentining to throw LE off his tail. But imho any advantage to be gained by serpentining was vastly outweighed by the absolute need to get out of the NYPD's jurisdiction ASAP. To me, it still makes no sense.

A¬†**fifth problem**¬†is that, based on my searches just now (but please correct me if I'm wrong), it appears that to get from Penn Station to Pittsburgh, you need to take Amtrak. Amtrak is currently showing the earliest train out of Penn Station to Pittsburgh on a Wednesday leaves at 10:52AM. (Btw, he wouldn't arrive in Pittsburgh until 8:05PM, gah.) So you're telling me that this guy commits an assassination, then goes and sits in the Amtrak lounge area from 8:23AM to 10:52AM, cooling his heels for \~1.5 hours, while the entire NYPD is fanning out across the island searching for him? When they'd be very likely to check all major train and bus stations first? If you're going to risk waiting around, why not wait a little longer in a small airport and take a pre-booked flight out of the country?

What is Java Burn?Ôªø  
Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to be mixed into your coffee. Unlike traditional weight loss pills or shakes, Java Burn is unique because it dissolves seamlessly in your morning coffee without adding any taste. According to the manufacturers, Java Burn is formulated to enhance the fat-burning process by boosting your metabolism and improving your body‚Äôs ability to burn calories more efficiently. The supplement contains natural ingredients known to help in weight loss, all without any harmful stimulants or additives.

Ingredients of Java Burn  
One of the key factors that people consider before using any supplement is its ingredients. What are the ingredients in Java Burn that make it effective? The product is made up of several natural compounds that are known to aid weight loss:

Green Tea Extract: Known for its antioxidant properties, green tea extract can boost metabolism and increase fat burning.  
Chlorogenic Acid: This compound, found in coffee, reduces the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive system, helping to prevent fat buildup.  
L-Theanine: An amino acid that works to improve focus and reduce anxiety, making it an excellent complement to the caffeine in coffee.  
Chromium: This mineral regulates blood sugar levels, helping to curb appetite and reduce cravings.

These ingredients work synergistically to deliver the promised benefits of increased fat burning and improved metabolism. Users have reported significant results, praising the supplement for helping them lose weight without the jitters or crashes often associated with caffeine-heavy products.

Where to Buy Java Burn  
For those wondering where to buy Java Burn, the official website is the safest bet.

Apparently, the suspect took couple of additional steps in this already circuitous route. Plus, I've added the leg down to Penn Station. I've included maps with estimated times below in and in the replies.

I was alerted to these additional steps by two reddit posts ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeLuigi/comments/1iciun0/new_video_theyre_wearing_a_medical_face_mask_here/)¬†and¬†[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrianThompsonMurder/comments/1iciqcl/am_i_the_only_one_who_hasnt_seen_this_video_of/)) that have brought to everyone's attention the fact that we previously overlooked a video that allegedly shows the suspect walking north past the Hilltop Pharmacy at 593 Fort Washington Avenue, just south of 187th Street:

As discussed in this¬†[NY Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/nyregion/uhc-shooting-gunman-getaway-bike.html), according to NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny, this video was taken AFTER the alleged sighting of the suspect, approximately at 7:30AM, at the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal. (The authorities have provided no images or video for that alleged 7:30AM sighting.) Here's a quote from the NYT article:

""Initially, investigators theorized that the man who shot Mr. Thompson had left New York on a bus from a terminal in Washington Heights. Cameras captured the man entering the bus depot on West 178th Street at about 7:30 a.m., but not leaving.

After fleeing Midtown on the bike in the early morning, the gunman hailed a cab at 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue and traveled to the bus station, paying the fare in cash.

But surveillance camera footage reviewed more recently by investigators showed him leaving the bus depot by subway.¬†*The gunman walked from the bus terminal to the 190th Street station, and from there he took the A train downtown train downtown to Pennsylvania Station, police said. A camera in a subway elevator captured his movements, Chief Kenny said*¬†\[emphasis added\].‚Äù

There are a few problems with the Hilltop Pharmacy video and Chief Kenny's statement.

**First problem**: The Hilltop Pharmacy video has no date/timestamp. It's therefore possible this video was taken¬†*BEFORE*¬†the alleged 7:30AM sighting at the Bus Terminal. If so, it would destroy LE's timeline. As shown in the map below, it takes at least \~21 minutes to walk from the suspect's prior alleged location (2372 Amsterdam Avenue, between 177th and 178th Streets) to this new alleged location (the Hilltop Pharmacy at 593 Fort Washington Avenue). (I say ""at least,"" because in the photo of Taxi Guy walking outside the taxi at 2372 Amsterdam, he's headed south, toward 177th Street, so he was headed in the *opposite* direction of both the Bus Terminal and the Hilltop Pharmacy.) It takes another 10 minutes to walk from 593 Fort Washington Avenue back down to the Bus Terminal. (See map in the first reply.) That would add 31 minutes to the total journey from the point where the suspect allegedly caught the cab at \~7:04AM (86th Street and Columbus) to the Bus Terminal, where he was allegedly sighted at \~7:30AM. Previously, I had used Google Maps to estimate this journey at \~27 minutes (giving LE a huge benefit of the doubt by refraining from taking rush-hour traffic into account). But with these two extra steps (to get up to the Hilltop Pharmacy and back), you'd need to add \~31 minutes to the original \~27 minutes, for a total of \~58 minutes. He would've arrived at the Bus Terminal at \~8:02AM. Impossible to get there by 7:30AM. Timeline, bye.

But, despite the lack of a date/timestamp, let's give Chief Kenny the benefit of the doubt, and grant him that the Hilltop video was taken¬†*AFTER*¬†7:30AM. As shown in the same map in the first reply below, it takes approximately 10 minutes to walk from the Bus Terminal to the Hilltop Pharmacy (same amount of time to walk in either direction), so the suspect would've been caught on video there at \~7:40AM. (I've used terrain maps here, because this area is definitely the ""heights"" part of Washington Heights, very hilly, and although this shouldn't affect Google's time estimates, it may come up later and it's probably a good fact to bear in mind.)

Anyway, according to Kenny, the suspect continued walking north another few blocks to the 190th Street Subway Station. As shown in the map below, the entire trip from the Bus Terminal to the 190th Street Subway Station would take approximately 17 minutes, so he would've arrived at \~7:47AM. (In an odd quirk of NYC geography, the 190th Street Subway Station is located about four blocks north of 190th Street and Fort Washington Avenue, at the equivalent of \~194th Street. The cross streets stop at 190th Street on Fort Washington Avenue, probably because the terrain is so hilly. Also, Google Maps doesn't recognize the subway station as a location, and the closest address I could find to input into Google Maps was 735 Fort Washington Avenue, which is maybe 20-30 yards north of the subway station. Using the exact longitude/latitude for the subway station yields the same 17-minute estimate, but results in Google converting the displayed address to ""190 St, Bennett Ave, New York, NY 10040,"" which I think could be confusing, because Bennett Avenue is a block further east of Fort Washington Avenue. Anyway, see the map in the reply below for this 17-minute estimate.)

Next, according to Kenny, at the 190th Street Station, the suspect rode the elevator down to the platform and took an A Train down to Penn Station. Google Maps estimated travel time on the A Train on a Wednesday as 26 minutes. (See map in the reply below.) He arrived at \~7:47AM. Let's say he had to wait 10 minutes for a train to arrive. That puts him in Penn Station about 36 minutes later, at \~8:23AM.

This brings us to the¬†**second problem**. A couple of people on reddit ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrianThompsonMurder/comments/1id0m46/the_route_he_took_after_the_shooting_is_frying_me/)) have said that the 190th Street Subway Station has been closed for more than a year. I haven't been able to verify that information, but¬†[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/190th_Street_station)¬†says that the elevators that lead from the station's stone head house (see photo in the replies) to the platform were taken out of service in 2020, that construction was supposed to be completed in 2021, and that it was pushed back due to delays. (Lol, looking into it also led me into a fascinating historical rabbit hole about the this colorful and atmospheric station, and the local-politics foofaraws in which the residents battled valiantly to have the fares removed from elevators, so that they could use them even when not taking the subway, to avoiding walking up an eight-story hill. They eventually won in 1957. I'll post an evocative photo of the Art Deco lighted ""SUBWAY"" sign above the staircase leading from Fort Washington Avenue down to the platform where you can get the elevator.) Anyway, if this subway station was indeed closed, then the suspect couldn't have used it to take the A Train down to Penn Station. And note that Kenny specifically said that ""A camera¬†*in a subway elevator*¬†captured his movements.""

A¬†**third problem**¬†is that, in walking to the 190th Street Subway Station, the suspect would've walked right past the 181st Street Subway Station. Both the 190th Street Station and the 181st Street Station are local stations on the A Train. Google estimates the trip from 181 Street as the same 26 minutes as the trip from 190th Street (see map below). So, he would've walked another nine blocks north, just to go to a totally fungible local subway station, and then add that same nine blocks of distance to his subway trip back down south to Penn Station. (When any New Yorker can tell you about the constant dread of subway trains stopping between stations for no reason at any time, and how you therefore never want to add even two inches to your subway trip.) WHY would he DO that?

A¬†**fourth problem**¬†is that this new video greatly exacerbates the original problem that this route is illogically circuitous, lengthy, and exposed to cameras. Many people on reddit are now claiming that the suspect was serpentining to throw LE off his tail. But imho any advantage to be gained by serpentining was vastly outweighed by the absolute need to get out of the NYPD's jurisdiction ASAP. To me, it still makes no sense.

Edit: Forgot the first map and deleted the fifth problem based on a helpful comment!

Full financial disclosure in the works to calculate child and spousal support and begin the division of assets through lawyers.

I asked for coffee and cards and the opportunity to keep a path open to another outcome.
""I would not of my free will look to spend anytime with you.""
Exactly what I needed to hear. 
Now I can challenge my thoughts that arise with the hard truth.

So, the emotions come and I ride the waves.

Today, it was a big swell. I couldn't get up on the board to catch it, it tumbled me around and left me gasping in its wake. 

Now to be honest with myself. 
""Remember the feeling of someone that is curious and caring.""
That isn't something I can find in so many years past with the person who's divorcing me.
""Remember to make friends and be yourself.""
The controlling, obsessive behaviour that I acquiesced to at the beginning of the partnership has damaged my ability to navigate friendships into my life. I'm free to reframe that and breathe the freedom of being me. There isn't anyone to say no anymore. 

I miss the potential, but potential isn't the reality and there's always the potential you're blinding yourself to. 
I miss the connection, but it's been gone for awhile and isn't coming back.
I miss the comfort, but there's was so much more discomfort in-between.

It's easy to focus on the losses and the misses and the what ifs and just maybes. It's not as easy to focus on the hard realities that challenge a person to grow into a richer life that lies ahead. That's the rewarding work.

Time to focus on the gains. 
Time to recite the freedoms. 
Time to build the new opportunities.
Time to open up to the future and those potentials I've been blind to. 

It's time to get up on that board and ride a wave of joy as it comes my way. 

For all my fellow people treading water, gasping for breath as you're pummeled with the weight of emotion. I got you. We got this. You've got great things coming. 

This whole experience is so hard, because it needs to sharpen your edges and give you the edge to cut through the crap of your life and help you break through to a better tomorrow; the one believed you weren't worthy of. You are worthy.",4,1738478678.0,Separation,0,1.0,False

I just landed a new job position in Pinellas county and I‚Äôm looking to move there once my lease is up in August. I was hoping to get suggestions and/or recommendations on any good areas or places that would align with what I‚Äôm looking for. Since my lease is up in August, I would like to visit any areas or certain places you all might suggest to make sure it would be a good fit.

Here‚Äôs some more details about me and what I‚Äôm looking for: 

- I‚Äôm a 23 year old female

- My job position is hybrid so I will need a somewhat decent area for my work desk and maybe a patio. I will be living away from my friends for the first time so I don‚Äôt want to go stir-crazy being in my house and not having a good surrounding area.

- I have two vehicles, one is a compact car (personal) and the other is a work truck. With that said I would need parking for the both of those.
	- Any suggestions or ideas on ways to make that more convenient for me would be greatly appreciated (especially bc apartment complexes are the 
most common places to live and parking may be limited)

- I would like an area that fits my age. I love beach days, paddle boarding, pottery and other crafts, picnics, park days, good local bars (not college-like bars. I like a few bars in downtown st pete and I would enjoy a nice local bar) I like local places to eat rather than commercial. I love a good coffee shop and deli. Overall, I love outside activities and being involved.

- I know it‚Äôs a lot to ask for and no area is perfect, but it‚Äôs worth putting it all out there! Any more questions or information just let me know, I might‚Äôve forgotten something I can‚Äôt think of :)

He prescribed me with Colchicine and after 2 days it was gone. 

Fast forward to today it's almost a month since my first flareup that started with my right foot, rendering me unable to walk. I  saw my podiatrist and he prescribed me with colchicine but it didn't work as smoothly as last time. It definitely improved but I was still struggling to walk. It then transferred to my left foot. I was then switched to allupurinol and he referred me to a rheumatologists as he thinks it could also be rheumatoid arthritis. 

  
I'm just insanely frustrated because I've been taking allupurinol for about 3 weeks now and some days it feels bearable and other days I just wake up with aching muscles. Sometimes I'm able to walk sometimes I struggle. My rheumatologist appointment is still in April which makes me feel helpless.

¬†Just another Morning , even the alarm seemed bored.

Now that we are talking of the alarm clock, it was a clock just with dials and not the fancy digital gizmo, as if it ¬†was also¬† somehow fighting the change perhaps just like its¬†¬†owner. Naveen its owners name was a kind of oxymoron for a person of his kind . Naveen was just the person who would love to keep the same calendar on his wall only if the years could remain same¬†

An orphan and single , and no friends or a love life to look up to, life was perennially¬†¬†same for Naveen. Somehow Naveen loved the changelessness if that‚Äôs even a word, in his life.

Coming back to the day, the alarm clock did its daily boring part of letting the house know that it was 6 am and Naveen pushed himself , opened his eyes , just for another similar ¬†day¬†

By completing all the tasks just as they were used to be done daily, Naveen was ready for office. He took the same 29 stairs down, took 45 steps towards the parking and voila there was his scooter, waiting for just another ride as usual.

While the ride used to be same and uneventful the only milestone moment used to be the 15^(th) cross on the roads of Bengaluru.

Why you ask well because of the beautiful face that used to be seen waiting for bus¬†.When Naveen used to pass by the bus stand at exactly 8:15 am, there he used to see this refreshing , beautiful face.

Who was she ?well this question was something that used to meet Naveen daily¬†

Finally, by 8:30, even before Naveen could come out of the dreamy visuals of his daily bus stop encounter, , his office used to snatch him out of his thoughts¬†

He used to park his scooter, go right past the security, and then a right turn , 15 steps to the basement office .

Naveen was as invisible as the walls of the office ‚Ä¶everyone knew the wall was there and was holding a lot of weight but nobody took notice of it¬†

Mr.Madhuram was the owner of the company where he used to work , and no unlike other things in his life, his stint with this company wasn‚Äôt old. He had joined this job around 3 months back¬†

In 3 months, he had become so evidently unnoticeable that people used to gossip about office politics to affairs, without being wary of his presence¬†

Mr Balu the chief accountant of Mr Madhuram‚Äôs all companies¬†¬†one day came rushing to Naveen and said , Naveen makes sure these files are entered in the accounting system but names should be of the other company of Sir¬†

Naveen did not have questions usually however going by a general tendency to explain Balu still explained.

You see Naveen, the accountant in that office is on sudden leave, these are important files, so records have to updated. Balu thought this much would be too much and broadly enough to explain the reason why accountant of one firm is accounting for another firm

Naveen did not seem to pay much heed to this and that‚Äôs what was the exact reason why he was given this task¬†

The reason why the files of another firm had to be given to Naveen was simple , the other firm was evading tax by hiding sales however sales for receivables had to be still recorded and¬†¬†so the files were given to Naveen¬†

Naveen carries on with the mundane task. Something that he was a master at. Be unnoticeable and keep doing unnoticeable unimportant things

A few days later the phone rings at Balu‚Äôs desk A frantic voice states Sir there is tax raid .Balu was confident and relaxed because the phone was anticipated well¬†

Baku was happy with his pre-empting this. He knew the other firm might be raided with many tax queries having been raised in past¬†

However, the moment of self-appreciation was short lived when he realised that the raid was in this company¬†, right where Naveen was sitting with the pile of incriminating evidence of tax evasion.

The tax departments team started checking and taking control of documents, desk by desk and also ¬†went to the small room in the basement where Naveen used to sit and of course ¬†confiscated the files¬†

The next day‚Äôs news was clear to everyone right Today. ‚ÄúA big tax evasion spotted¬†by Tax sleuths‚Äù

Next day Naveen was sitting¬†¬†at Welu bros¬†pvt ltd‚Äôs swanky lobby ¬†for a job .he knew he would get it since¬†¬†companies ¬†like these loved people like Naveen who could do what they were told to do without questions and applying filters of right and wrong. Typically, people who were proficient with accounts but were ethically dumb to questions malpractices.¬†

After he interview and an offer letter in hand, ¬†Naveen for the first time did something new He took a detour in the afternoon ¬†to the coffee house at the JB circle¬†.

He entered the coffee house and the waiter as if recognised him

Brought the coffee without ordering, he even knew that Naveen Sir would like a butter toast with coffee and also came ¬†and a slip.

The aromatic coffee , with just the right amount of milk and perfect sugar, the creamy butter toast with hints of crisp bread¬† and the familiar slip which read¬†

Nice work on this mission too with¬†¬†let‚Äôs get the Welu bros now¬†

The tax inspector Naveen smiled and got up for his Naveen assignment¬†. Somethings in life become easier if you are too boring for others to evidently open up in front of you , was the mantra of Tax inspector Naveen, who was known in his circles as the Ghost of Accurate raids.

No one knew how he always managed to catch the large fish with such ease , other than Naveen himself.

We need to talk about Hanley. We need to talk about Hanley because we need to do something about the town which is our city centre.

It may not be the Mother Town, but it is at the heart of our city and, if we are being honest, it needs some TLC.

When I am knocking on doors and speaking with people across Stoke-on-Trent Central, we almost always get onto the topic of Hanley. They are always conversations full of happy memories of time spent there as children or the pubs and clubs people used to visit. But those memories then turn to sadness over what the town has become.

There are, of course, brilliant businesses in Hanley ‚Äì all flying the flag for retail shopping and doing their bit to keep the high street going. Without them, the city centre would be dead. Supporting them, we have the coffee shops and restaurants, the theatres, the museum and the market. The building blocks are all there to make Hanley something special. But we‚Äôre running out of time.

That‚Äôs why at the end of last year, I took the leader of the city council, the council‚Äôs chief executive and the head of the Chamber of Commerce to meet with the new Labour minister in the Department of Communities, and his officials, to enlist their support for our city centre. This is because to deliver the changes we need in Hanley will take everyone pulling together ‚Äì locally and nationally.

We will need new housing around the city centre, we will need to name and shame the rogue landlords who leave buildings empty and rotting. We will have to crack down on the monkey dust users and the anti-social behaviour that can be so off-putting. And we will need to show the big-name stores who we all want back that they can thrive in Hanley.

Some of this is already happening. Credit must go to Stoke-on-Trent City Centre Business Improvement District which puts on events, supports local businesses and is working incredibly hard to provide an alternative story for Hanley. Its determination to promote the absolute best parts of the area is hugely successful but the revival of Hanley is now a mammoth task and needs a proper plan for recovery.

The best the last Conservative-run council, backed by the Conservative Government, were able to offer was a new car park, Smithfield, which has ended up making far less in revenue than was expected. Their other plan was an arena that never got off the ground and an unfunded promise for the redevelopment of Etruscan Square (the old bus station).

But that Conservative failure was the latest in a long line of let-downs. Who remembers ‚ÄòCity Sentral‚Äô or the ‚ÄòCentral Business District‚Äô or the ‚ÄòEast - West Precinct‚Äô?

Repeatedly, we have been promised the Earth only to be left with dirt. It must stop because we cannot afford any more failures.

So, let‚Äôs keep talking about Hanley, let‚Äôs demand more, and, together, we can turn those conversations, both locally and in Westminster, into a bright future for our city centre.",5,1738477917.0,stokeontrent,0,0.86,False

I am aware I am thin. I am not particularly afraid of gaining weight. I don‚Äôt count calories. My exercise is not ludicrously excessive. There‚Äôs no laxatives, no vomiting, not even body checking, really. The dream, right? 

I just accidentally waged a slow war of attrition on my body, almost by accident. 

First I became vegetarian. Ethics, right? The environment. CO2 emissions. I‚Äôve said it so many times it‚Äôs true. It also happens to be my free pass to eat usually-a-salad, with the added bonus of not needing to decide between more than one or two options. 

I already wasn‚Äôt really a breakfast person. It was easy enough to be not really a lunch person too. Lunch was expensive. At least that‚Äôs what I tell myself. I have said *‚ÄùI‚Äôm not really a lunch person, but I‚Äôll come for the walk!‚Äù* so many times I think it is true. If I even try to eat lunch on a weekday, my brain often turns to static when making a decision. 

Then I knocked out the milk based coffees if I was at work. I used to drink a lot of them, enough to keep me at a weight where doctors don‚Äôt panic. For some reason I can‚Äôt articulate, I swapped them for various black coffees. And I can give you a long spiel about the superiority of whatever-way-I-brewed-the-black-coffee and talk some shit about the beans and the roast date as though I give a fuck, but really I just need 8L of caffeine to get me through the day. 

For a period, there was getting home late so it was easy to say I‚Äôd already eaten. This one was almost too easy, given my partner and I share a credit card, and if I‚Äôd been buying dinner and lunch most days it would presumably more than match our weekly grocery budget. 

But on the flip side, I can eat perfectly well if there‚Äôs a celebration. A lot, even. If people come over, during holidays, birthdays, even by healthy person standards. And I do not feel guilty. I struggle with the question *‚ÄùDo you binge?‚Äù* (if I ate a whole pizza, while with other people, and I don‚Äôt feel guilty, is it a binge?).

It‚Äôs *so different* to the boilerplate eating disorder I had as a teenager. 

I resent the blood test referral next to me, that says *‚Äù30 y.o. female with eating disorder‚Äù* in the clinical notes (and if it were written today, would say ‚Äú31 y.o. female with eating disorder‚Äù). I do not look like I have an eating disorder, I gained a solid amount of weight when it was gain-weight-or-inpatient.

Given how different it is to the teenager that religiously measured and tracked everything, ran 10 km and did an additional 4 hours of exercise daily, it doesn‚Äôt *feel* like an eating disorder. 

It just feels like I‚Äôm fucking terrible at eating.

I used to play Arcaea and Zenless Zone Zero on a Motorola Edge + (2022) and that was great. I haven't gotten my pixel yet, so I haven't seen performance yet,

but I'm worried!

""time 4 some motherfucking necropolitics lmao""

being alchemized into dronefood. who needs ai when u have i. the most advanced neural network was always already there, ready 2 decide the next signature strike victim, bioalgorithmic war, the human is artificial to begin with. post-inhumanism.

peer through the nightmarescope and see the red neon world. your veins are one with the wires of pulsating technocapitalism. producing surplus value was hever easier. just moderating the social media of life & death, lol, the necroalgorithms that accompany this massive tele-thanatological bio-network sure are amazing. uWu

you can't lose a dronized war but you can't win one either. the effect is perpetual hopelessness, 2 alienate everyone from meaningful retaliation against imperial terror. the sky is an evil eye.
verticality. 
drone's eye view. 
survterror. 
AGM-114 Hellfire Missile. 
reaper. 
predator. 
global hawk.

all ops are black ops. democratize drone violence imo. fully integrated aerial control society.

nuke me.
