It started early Thursday afternoon, and it is now Saturday evening. 

Here’s what I’ve done/taken/tried (not necessarily in this order, especially since many of these things I’ve done multiple times):

Advil Dual Action, Nerivio, sumatriptan, Nurtec, essential oils, coffee, water with electrolytes, McMigraine Meal, BeKoool patches, hot shower, lying in the dark…

I’m about to give up/in and take a Vicodin, which I have leftover from a prescription from my last really bad migraine, because I *really need* to be functional tomorrow, and I’m also sick and tired of being miserable. But if I wake up in the morning and the migraine still hasn’t passed, I’ll be heading to urgent care and asking for a ketamine infusion, because that helped me a lot last time!! (Although pray that doesn’t need to happen because then I absolutely WILL NOT be functional all day!!)

Side note: Is it weird that I’m looking forward to my first round of Botox in a few weeks? I know it can take a few rounds to take effect, but I’m so over getting these horrible migraines that last for days! I wouldn’t wish it upon my worst enemy!

I finished it in a weekend and dropped it in the after-hours return slot like always.

Three days later it was on my bookshelf.
Same cracked spine, same faint coffee stain on page 43.
I even checked the inside cover—there was the library’s bar code, peeled halfway off where I’d fidgeted with it.

I convinced myself I’d bought a copy years ago and forgotten.
Still, I returned it again, this time over the counter.
The clerk scanned it, said, “All set,” and tossed it on the cart.

That night, I woke to a soft thud.
The book was on the floor beside my bed, open to a random page.
The paragraph at the center read:

> “He tried to give it back, but it knew the way home.”



I burned it in the sink the next morning.
Ash, smoke, gone.

When I came home from work, the smell of paper and dust filled the apartment.
There it was on the shelf again—unburned, clean, its cover slightly different.
The author’s name was now mine.

I took it straight to the library.
The clerk frowned and scanned the barcode.
Her screen froze, and she whispered, “This book isn’t checked out. It never was.”

I opened to the first page.
Under Property of the City Library someone had written in pencil:

> “Thank you for returning yourself.”



The bar code sticker started to peel away again, slow as breathing.
Underneath was my address.

1ogb8ku,https://i.redd.it/gib3j8oisdxf1.png,The Essential Guide to Men's Clothing: Unveiling the Stylish Offerings of La Mode Men's,"When it comes to men’s clothing, style is more than what you wear — it’s how you carry yourself. Every detail matters, from the cut of your suit to the texture of your polo. And that’s where **La Mode Men's** comes in — a brand that understands the modern man’s desire to look sharp without compromising on comfort or quality.

This guide takes you through everything you need to know about building a timeless wardrobe. From tailored suits and elegant dress shirts to casual essentials and statement accessories, La Mode Men's has redefined what it means to dress with purpose and sophistication.

# Why Dressing Well Still Matters

Let’s be honest — the way you dress says a lot about you. Whether you’re stepping into a job interview, attending a wedding, or just grabbing coffee on a Sunday morning, your outfit silently communicates confidence, attention to detail, and self-respect.

**La Mode Men's** knows that great style doesn’t have to be complicated. Their philosophy? Quality fabrics, impeccable tailoring, and versatility — pieces that effortlessly transition from the boardroom to the weekend.

# The Power of a Perfectly Tailored Suit

# The Backbone of Men’s Style

There’s something undeniably powerful about a well-fitted suit. It’s more than clothing — it’s armor. A suit instantly boosts your confidence, sharpens your silhouette, and commands attention.

La Mode Men's offers **tailored suits** that strike the right balance between modern fit and timeless appeal. Whether you prefer a classic cut or a contemporary slim fit, each suit is crafted with precision to enhance your body shape.

# Colors and Patterns That Never Fade

You can never go wrong with **navy, charcoal gray, or black**. These classic shades are versatile, seasonless, and universally flattering. Want to make a subtle statement? Go for **pinstripes, checks, or herringbone** — patterns that whisper style without shouting for attention.

# Dress Shirts: Subtle, Sharp, and Essential

# Fabric and Fit Make All the Difference

Think of your dress shirt as the foundation of your look. A great shirt feels comfortable, breathes well, and fits perfectly. La Mode Men's uses **high-quality fabrics like Egyptian cotton and poplin**, ensuring durability and softness.

They also offer a variety of fits — from **tailored slim cuts** for a modern edge to **regular fits** that allow more movement. The goal? Effortless comfort without sacrificing elegance.

# Collars that Frame Your Personality

Collar style can change the entire vibe of your outfit:

* **Spread collars**: best for modern, bold looks
* **Point collars**: ideal for a traditional touch
* **Button-down collars**: perfect for relaxed sophistication

La Mode Men's ensures every detail — from the collar curve to the stitching — complements your face and style.

# Casual Essentials for Everyday Cool

# Polo Shirts and Henleys: The Smart-Casual Icons

Not every day calls for a suit. Sometimes, effortless style is about comfort with polish. That’s where **polo shirts and Henleys** come in.

La Mode Men's polos are made from breathable, soft fabrics that keep you cool and confident all day. Available in a variety of **colors and textures**, they’re perfect for business-casual environments or laid-back weekends.

Henleys, on the other hand, bring a slightly rugged, masculine vibe. They pair beautifully with jeans or chinos, offering that relaxed yet refined aesthetic.

# Casual Shirts That Go the Distance

Casual shirts are the unsung heroes of a versatile wardrobe. Think **chambray, flannel, denim, or linen** — each with its own texture and mood.

Pair them with chinos for brunch or jeans for a night out. The best part? They strike the perfect balance between “I didn’t try too hard” and “I still look put together.”

# Outerwear That Defines Your Style

# From Bomber Jackets to Overcoats

Outerwear isn’t just practical — it’s often the first thing people notice about you. Whether it’s a **sleek bomber**, a **classic pea coat**, or a **sophisticated overcoat**, La Mode Men's has mastered the art of combining functionality with fashion.

Each jacket is crafted to handle different climates while maintaining that sharp, tailored look that elevates any outfit.

# Function Meets Fashion

La Mode Men's outerwear often features **smart materials** — waterproof coatings, breathable linings, and lightweight insulation — ensuring comfort without bulk. It’s style with purpose.

# Bottoms That Work Everywhere

# Dress Pants: A Wardrobe Essential

Dress pants are the foundation of formalwear, but they’ve evolved beyond the office. La Mode Men's offers **flat-front and slim-fit designs** that pair just as well with a blazer as they do with a crisp shirt. The result? A streamlined silhouette that works in nearly any setting.

# Denim: The Forever Favorite

Few things are as timeless as a great pair of jeans. La Mode Men's denim collection includes **straight-leg, slim-fit, and distressed** options — each offering flexibility and comfort.

Dress them up with a blazer and loafers, or go casual with a tee and sneakers. With the right fit and wash, jeans can take you anywhere.

# The Art of Accessorizing

# Ties and Pocket Squares: Small Details, Big Impact

Accessories are like punctuation marks for your outfit — they add character and polish. A **tie or pocket square** can elevate even a simple suit.

La Mode Men's offers a wide range of textures and colors — from luxurious silk ties to patterned squares — helping you express personality without saying a word.

# Belts, Shoes, and Watches

These are the finishing touches that tie everything together (literally). La Mode Men's ensures its accessories are made from **genuine leather and premium materials**, so your look always feels intentional and refined.

# Building a Wardrobe That Lasts

# Quality Over Quantity

Fast fashion fades. True style endures. La Mode Men's focuses on **craftsmanship**, **premium fabrics**, and **attention to detail** — meaning each piece is an investment that lasts for years, not months.

# Classic Foundations, Modern Flair

The secret to great style isn’t chasing every new trend. It’s about knowing what works and adding a personal twist. La Mode Men's captures that balance perfectly — timeless essentials with just enough modern edge.

# Style Tips from the Experts

1. **Fit is everything** — even an expensive suit looks sloppy if it doesn’t fit right.
2. **Invest in basics** — quality shirts, well-cut trousers, and neutral outerwear form the base of every outfit.
3. **Layer smartly** — use textures and tones to add depth.
4. **Mind your shoes** — people notice them more than you think.
5. **Accessorize minimally** — one or two statement pieces are enough.

We already had each other on the Bump app to stay in touch, so we left it on while we dashed. It helped us spread out, find better areas, and meet up for quick coffee breaks when things slowed down. Once we figured that out, everything started to click.

Some friends saw how well it worked and joined us. Then their friends joined too. Now there are about thirty of us in one big group.

Headed to pickup spot and guy is already messaging me about his pickup location. Immediate weird vibe, we all know the feeling...

Gets in with coffee tumbler, I allow drinks... says little. Feeling getting worse about this pax....

We head to I35 South and it's complete standstill so I use a cut through, Palmer lane to pick up Mopac South. 

On Mopac going 65 MPH and all I hear him say is....blah, blah ""accident."" 

I IMMEDIATELY launch into 10-2, shoot straight up in my seat looking at all my mirrors thinking, ""is there and accident, am I going to cause one??"" 

And he says, ""no I think I'm going to have an accident in your car. I need to use the restroom."" Me: ""Oh, ok I'll just pull over."" He then said, ""I won't make it, can I use this?"" as he pushes the coffee tumbler in between the front seats...

I'm still going 65, thinking if I say yes, he's going to do it and if I say no, he will accident in my car. So I said ok. 

He takes off the top and starts to pee. I can hear him filling it up so then I'm like, ""shit, what if he runs out of room?!! Is he going to roll down the window, dump it and keep going??"" Still 65 MPH toward Ben White, 7:30 am...

He stopped. Heart pounding thinking, ""just get him OUT of my car!"" 

We get to final destination, he gets out...no apology no goodbye, no tip. 

I call Uber and she said, ""he did what?!"" Yes, ma'am he did that...

Few weeks later I get an extremely professional email from support saying they have taken care of the situation. Have no idea how they resolved it, but pretty sure I know. 

A lot of people that I've told the story to always say that I should have just pulled over and kicked him out. Cancel the ride. Just stop what was going on. When you're going 65 mph and presented with such a situation so early in the morning it's easy to say now what I should have done. 

The learning lesson that I got from this was to think about different scenarios and how I would handle them if it ever presented itself.

I started working there in late May/early June and helped the owners out a lot at the beginning. I only worked 2-3 days from then until August. 

I previously worked in different coffee shops over the years and have skills and knowledge as a barista which helped my boss who didn’t know much. I helped make recipes and ways of making drinks in order stuff was all made correctly as eel as helping with other things. All the other baristas were high school girls with no experience in being a barista (or even having a job) and whose mothers are friends with my boss. I was obviously the one with the most experience and skill and my boss acknowledged that. 

When school came around I started working full time (6:30am-4pm Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday). I am usually the only barista (I also take orders) except for my boss who helps when it’s busy (she comes in at 9am and leaves at 2pm) and a home schooled girl who works Thursday and Friday from 6:30am-9:30am). It’s been a few months of me constantly having this schedule (scheduled on Google Calendar). 

There have been a few problems with my boss and we had an argument awhile ago resulting in me leaving my shift out of frustration and not being able to physically work because of how I felt confronting her and then getting into a verbal fight with her. I feel like we’ve gone back to normal with no talk of the argument but there have still been issues…

Two weeks ago I had an appointment with my neurologist in a city an hour and a half away (I have epilepsy). I informed my boss and said I had to leave early (around 2) but that I could see if someone could cover for me. She didn’t say much and just said I could leave then. While at the doctor he scheduled me for an appointment for an mri in the same city this Thursday at 4:20. I texted my boss that I had another appointment on Thursday the 30th last week after my first appointment but told her I’d get back to her on when I would need to leave by. Later the next week I told her in person that the appointment was around 4:30 and could probably stay until closing (3) but not close. 

Today I texted her reminding me of my appointment and said I would need to leave at 3 so I wouldn’t be able to close. My schedule was still the same on the shared Google Calendar. She texted back:

“Next week you’re working Wednesday, not Thursday or Friday”

I was confused. Not necessarily about being switched to Wednesday since that made sense but mostly why I wasnt working on Friday like I normally do. I asked her if something was wrong and she replied:

“No, I thought your appointment t was all day so that had originally switch Wednesday and Thursday and then Friday there’s no school so some of the high schoolers asked to work”

I have problems with this…

1. I was given 4(ish) days notice that I was switched to Wednesday. I normally never work Wednesdays and plan other things for Wednesday. Wednesday the 5th I have another important appointment with my normal doctor (that i rescheduled for Wednesday specifically) and if I wouldve had that appointment this Wednesday I would either have to reschedule again or disappoint my boss and make her frustrated at me and have to find someone to work (which they don’t really have someone to work…).

2. I am an adult who has bills and works full time, my shifts should not be taken away because high schoolers have the day off and want to work. She struggles to find someone to work Saturdays (the day I have requested to not work since I am an adult with adult friends who have adult jobs and we want to see each other on the weekends…I also have a husband who works full time that Id like to spend the day with). I have had to work some Saturdays when she “can’t find” anyone to work…

Hello! My name is Notevoke, and I'm looking for someone who is interested in doing a Superman roleplay based on the 2025 James Gunn movie! While I've never been crazy into DC, this movie obviously has me obsessed, and so I'd like to explore the universe more with a partner. 

Rules 
• 21+ partners only
• Semi-lit to literate (3-6+ paragraphs)
• Minimum one reply per week
• Please have a writing sample ready!

Setting
Option A :
New interns are rare at the Daily Planet. Between Perry White's high expectations and the fast pace environment, not many people could handle the world of journalism. Word spreads fast, however, and before Clark Kent could really even make it to his desk— on time, for once— he was hearing mutters about someone new. 

Clark was, in all honesty, excited! New interns meant that there would eventually be another journalist out in the world who could spread truth that the people of Metropolis needed! As the clacking of heels along with a meek ""coffee order?"" began making it's way around the office, he was nore than happy to give them a big welcome!

Lifting his head, Clark spun in his little office chair, smiling wide as he finally caught sight of their new member. 

It was her. The woman Superman saved on Wetmore and 9th Street from some low-level purse snatcher. 

Option B:
Childhood friends weren't meant to last. 

That was something that Clark Kent accepted long ago, when he decided to leave the small town of Smallville to face his dreams in the bustling city of Metropolis. He'd left behind his home, his parents, and most importantly: his best friend. 

So when Clark recieved the text late one Wednesday night, he didn't know how to feel. It was from a number he didn't recognize at first, but it was quickly apparent who it was from. There was no mistaking the unqiue mesh of emoji's and abbreviations. 

His best friend was moving to Metropolis.

Alright, let's get on with it!

Scene #6 - 2nd Office Scene 

This one has always been one of my favorite scenes in the show, and the creative team really did it justice with that little break room cart. It's a simple, non-neccesary addition, but it's better than just having Charlotte walk on with the coffee pot. 

I thought Ted having a phone in that scene was a really nice touch, and you better believe that Charlotte's failing marriage is portrayed so funnily and sad at the same time, which really goes to show Jaime's incredible acting abilities. 

I didn't really have anything bad to say about this scene, but I absolutely need to point out the lighting for this specific scene. I loved the way that when Charlotte was talking about the fact that Sam got home late, the lights got dark around her a if we are in the failing marriage with her... then Ted opens his big fat mouth with the ""He didn't come home at all!"" and the lights all go back to how they were. 

The lighting, no matter how simple it may be, is so great at setting the mood for a scene you might call a sort of 'filler' scene!

Scene #7 - *What Do You Want, Paul?* 

Now let me tell you something about this number- I used to hate it in the original version. It was funny at first, but the sex jokes aren't really my type of humor. It still isn't, but my goodness was this number so funny!! 

I loved Mr. Davidson's sharp movements throughout, and this number wouldn't be half as funny without Paul's amazing facial expressions! Jon's blank stare of pure ""GET ME OUT OF HERE!!"" paired with Jeff's incredible stage presence made this number so hilarious. 

Also I'm sure a big highlight of this number for everyone was when Mr. Davidson whispered to Paul 'I didn't forget'. I felt that in the original production, it was very hard to interprete that bit- did Mr. Davidson actually forget? Or was he too embarrassed to ask his wife? I'm so glad they cleared it up in the new version, because it makes the number so much funnier. 

I still don't like the whole 'choke me' joke, but i absolutely condone Mr. Davidson choking Paul with the phone cord, and then on his big ""PAUL!!"" he just yanks it. 

My only gripe with the number (other than the whole choking thing) was the fact that it was in a lower key. This will be a reoccurring note throughout my review, because it is very obvious that Jeff is more comfortable in his higher range, and his performances overall feel less powerful and meaningful when they are in his lower range. 

I know a lot of people got tired of his falsetto, which i could maybe see why, but at the end of the day when I think of *The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals* and *Black Friday* I traditionally think of Jeff's amazing vocals. I know he did really great in his lower range as Aladdin in Twisted, but it's very obvious that songs like *WDYWP* and *Tied Up My Heart* were written for his higher range and meant to be sung falsetto. 

Scene #8 - *Cup of Roasted Coffee*/*Cup of Poisoned Coffee* 

This scene is easily one of the most iconic scenes in the show, but it didn't hold up for my in my opinion unfortunately. That's not to say that there wasn't anything good to say about this scene- like the crazy smooth scene change, but I felt Jon's delivery in a lot of his lines in this scene were subpar. For example, when Emma starts singing 'black coffee! Im your coffee gal!', his 'NOOOOOO!!' wasn't as strong as his delivery in the original version. 

Just in general, one of the most quoted part of *TGWDLM*, the 'think about the implications' monologue, was done much better in the original version in my opinion. One of the highlights of that scene for me was Jon's facial expressions when he says ""ARE YOU FRIGHTENED???"", but his hilarious look was no where to be found in the reprise. 

As for the songs, the choreography and harmonies were much more refined, and I have no notes! Absolutely brilliant! Emma's quitting monologue was excellent, and Jaime and Mariah portrayed the aliens so perfectly. And the lighting team did an incredible job, and it all came together to be one incredible number! 

I'm sad that they didn't keep the part where Jon and Lauren walked in the aisle of the audience and called them shrubs, but i definitely loved how Emma said ""Omg... I'm unemployed!"" That was really one of my favorite new jokes in the show. 

I thought the trash cans were really cool, they looked really cartoonish and silly. My final note for this scene is that I LOVED Jon's delivery of ""Latte Hotay""!!! It's so awkward and you can just feel the embarrassment leaking through the screen. 

Okay, that's all from me for now! Sorry that I didn't really do the 'one part a day thing' I said I was going to do in my first post, but I'm going so in depth that it takes a very long time to write these and I don't have much time to because of school... see yall in the next part!",2,1761451269.0,StarKid,0,1.0,False

This happened a few months ago, but I still think about it every morning.

I (29F) have this ceramic coffee mug that I’ve used for years. My sister made it in a pottery class, so it’s sentimental. The glaze is this mottled beige-brown that kind of looks like there’s coffee residue on the inside  but it’s completely clean, just how it was fired.

Anyway, one morning I get into work and can’t find my mug. I check the sink, my desk, the breakroom shelf, nothing. Then I notice a new cheap white mug in its place with a sticky note that says, “Thought you’d want a cleaner one 😊 - Jen.”

Jen.
Our self-appointed “office mom.”

I asked her about it, thinking maybe she was just borrowing mine. Nope. She threw it away. Said it was “unsanitary” and “looked like mold.”

I told her it was handmade and literally part of the glaze, not dirt. She just blinked and said, “Oh, I didn’t realize it meant something to you.”

The kicker? She didn’t even throw it in the normal trash. She put it in the dumpster outside because “it smelled like old coffee.”

I spent my lunch break elbow-deep in the dumpster (gross, I know) and somehow found it, chipped, but still intact. I took it home, cleaned it up, and now it stays there. I use it on video calls just so Jen can see it survived her “cleanup.”",0,1761451241.0,coworkerstories,3,0.33,False

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.

The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie,  Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.

""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains.""

""Where are you going?""

""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard.""

My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part.

I declined the call and walked to the door. Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts...""

""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you.""

""Camille, please...""

""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually.""

""For what?""

""For finally showing me the truth. About her, about you, about who I need to become.""

I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me.

Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty.

My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all.

Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist.

I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.

# Chapter 2

Camille's point of view 

The house was quiet, too quiet. I slipped in through the side door, locking it softly behind me. The air smelled like lemon polish and roses, just like it always did. It felt strange to be back, like stepping into someone else’s life.

The kitchen was dark except for the faint glow of the fridge light. I crept up the stairs, careful to skip the third step that creaked. Every sound I made felt loud, like the house itself was listening.

When I reached my bedroom door, I stopped. It was open a crack, just like I’d left it all those years ago. Taking a deep breath, I stepped inside and shut the door.

My childhood bedroom hadn't changed in three years. Same pale pink walls, same white furniture, same collection of second-place trophies. Rose's first-place ones used to shine in the room next door.

I stared at my reflection in the vanity mirror, the same one where I'd practiced my wedding makeup three years ago, Rose standing behind me with that perfect smile. Now my mascara was smeared, hair wild, designer dress wrinkled. Mom would have a fit if she saw me like this.

The clock on my nightstand read 10:47 PM. I'd been sitting here for hours, packing what little of my old life I wanted to keep. Amazing how seventeen years in this house fit into one duffel bag.

My phone buzzed again, the twentieth time in an hour. This time it was Mom.

""Camille, this is ridiculous. Come home so we can discuss this like adults. Rose is worried sick...""

I hung up. Of course Rose was worried. Her carefully laid plans were unraveling.

The front door clicked open downstairs. I froze, listening to familiar footsteps on hardwood. The slight tap of heels, the whisper of expensive fabric.

""Camille?"" Mom's voice floated up the stairs. ""Darling, I know you're here. The housekeeper saw your car.""

I should have parked around the block. Should have been smarter, faster, better at disappearing. But I'd never been the clever one, had I? That was Rose's role.

More footsteps. A deeper voice, Dad, probably called home from work to deal with his hysterical younger daughter. Again.

""Princess?"" His voice carried that same gentle tone he'd used when I was twelve, crying about Rose getting my spot in the school play. ""Let's talk about this.""

A third set of footsteps made my blood freeze. Lighter, more graceful. Perfect, like everything else about her.

""Camille?"" Rose's voice dripped concern. ""Sweetie, please. Don't shut us out.""

I looked at the family photo on my dresser, taken the day Rose's adoption was finalized. Mom and Dad beaming, Rose radiant in her new dress, thirteen-year-old me trying to smile through braces and acne. One big happy family.

What a joke.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut:

\---

""But I've been practicing for months!"" I clutched my script, tears blurring the words. ""Mrs. Bennett said the lead was mine!""

Rose touched my shoulder, gentle as always. ""Oh, sweetie. I didn't mean to take your part. I just... the words came so naturally in the audition. Mrs. Bennett said I had a gift.""

Of course she did. Everyone said Rose had a gift. For music, for acting, for making people love her.

""Maybe..."" Rose's eyes lit up with that special gleam that always meant trouble. ""Maybe you could help me practice? Be my supporting actress? We could make it our sister thing!""

I'd agreed. Because that's what good sisters did. Because saying no to Rose meant disappointed looks from Mom, lectures from Dad about family loyalty.

Opening night, I watched from the wings as Rose brought the audience to tears. Afterward, Mom bought her roses. Dad took us all to dinner.

No one mentioned that I'd written Rose's best lines during our ""practice sessions."" Or that her dramatic monologue had been word-for-word what I'd performed in my original audition.

Rose just had a gift for memorization, that's all.

\---

""Camille Elizabeth Lewis!"" Mom's voice sharpened. ""This behavior is completely unacceptable.""

I opened my bedroom door.

They stood in the hallway like a perfect family portrait, Mom in her designer suit, Dad looking distinguished in his work clothes, Rose wearing concern like the latest fashion trend.

""Hello, sister."" My voice came out steady. ""Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancé?""

Rose's eyes widened. Always the performer. ""Camille, please. Let me explain...""

""Explain what? How you've been sleeping with my husband? Or how you set this whole thing up from the beginning?""

""What is she talking about?"" Dad turned to Rose, who already had tears forming. Perfect, delicate tears that never smeared her makeup.

""She's upset,"" Rose whispered. ""Lashing out. You know how she gets, Daddy.""

""Don't."" My laugh sounded strange, even to me. ""Don't you dare play that card again. Show them the ring, Rose. The one Stefan gave you two months ago while I was supposedly too sick to attend the charity gala.""

Mom gasped. Dad's face darkened. But Rose, Rose's mask slipped for just a second. I saw it this time, that flash of cold calculation behind the concern.

""It wasn't like that,"" she started.

""Really? Then how was it? Explain to everyone how you've been calling me every week, giving me marriage advice while sleeping with my husband. Tell them about all the times you helped me pick out lingerie for anniversaries when Stefan was really working late with you.""

""That's enough!"" Mom stepped forward. ""Rose would never...""

""Never what, Mom? Never lie? Never manipulate? Never steal something that belonged to her sister?"" I pulled out my phone, playing the last voicemail from Stefan.

His voice filled the hallway: ""Rose is my soulmate, Camille. We tried to fight it, but some people are just meant to be together. You have to understand...""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Rose recovered first. ""I never meant to hurt you. We can't help who we love...""

The sound of my palm connecting with her cheek echoed like a gunshot.

""Camille!"" Mom grabbed my arm. ""Have you lost your mind?""

""No,"" I said quietly, watching a red mark bloom on Rose's perfect face. ""For the first time in fourteen years, I'm seeing clearly.""

I walked past them, duffel bag in hand. Behind me, Rose's sobs started, the same performance she'd perfected over years of turning everyone against me.

""Where are you going?"" Dad called after me. ""You can't just walk away from family!""

I paused at the top of the stairs, looking back at my so-called family. Mom comforting Rose, Dad looking torn, and my sister watching me through her tears with eyes that held no warmth at all.

""Family?"" I smiled, and something in my expression made them all step back. ""No, this isn't family. This is a game. And for fourteen years, I've been playing by Rose's rules.""

""Camille, please,"" Rose reached for me, ever the caring sister. ""Let me make this right.""

I caught her wrist before she could touch me. ""You taught me well, big sister. About manipulation. About patience. About waiting for the perfect moment to strike.""

Her eyes widened, real fear this time, not performed.

""Thank you for the lessons,"" I whispered, letting her go. ""Now watch how well I learned them.""

I walked down the stairs, ignoring their calls. In the foyer mirror, I caught one last glimpse of myself, mascara-stained, wild-eyed, finally unchained.

# Chapter 3

ROSE'S POINT OF VIEW

I swirled the champagne in my crystal flute, watching the bubbles dance. Victory tasted sweet, just like I'd imagined all these years. The living room of my penthouse apartment overlooked the city where I'd spent twenty years pretending to be the perfect adopted daughter, the loving sister, the supportive friend.

What a joke.

""To freedom,"" I whispered to my reflection in the window. The woman staring back at me smiled, perfect teeth, perfect hair, perfect lies. Just like always.

My phone buzzed again. Another missed call from Stefan. He'd been calling non-stop since Camille walked out, probably worried I'd change my mind now that everything was in the open. Poor, predictable Stefan. Still thinking he was in control of any of this.

I kicked off my Louboutins and sank into the leather couch, letting memories wash over me like warm wine.

\---

The first time I saw Camille Lewis, I hated her.

I was thirteen, fresh out of foster care, desperate to please my new parents. They'd brought me to this massive house with its manicured lawn and marble floors, promising me a fresh start. A real family.

Then this skinny thing with braces and messy hair came bouncing down the stairs, all eager smiles and innocent eyes.

""Hi! I'm Camille. I've always wanted a sister!""

She hugged me right there in the foyer, not caring that my clothes were secondhand or that I smelled like the group home's industrial detergent. Just pure, genuine joy at having a sister.

I wanted to vomit.

Because there she was, this awkward, imperfect girl who had everything I'd spent thirteen years dreaming about. Parents who actually wanted her. A home she belonged in. A future secured by the Lewis family name.

And she didn't even appreciate it properly.

I watched her over dinner that first night, watched how she slouched in her chair and talked with her mouth full. How she didn't know which fork to use for salad. How she laughed too loud and asked too many questions.

""Rose has such lovely manners,"" Mrs. Lewis .... Mom .....  had said, smiling at me. ""Perhaps you could learn from your new sister, Camille.""

That's when I saw it. The first crack in Camille's perfect world. The slight dimming of her smile, the way she sat up straighter, tried harder.

It was beautiful.

\---

My phone buzzed again, pulling me back to the present. Stefan's face lit up my screen, his fifth call in an hour. With a sigh, I answered.

""Darling, you're being needy.""

""Rose."" His voice was rough. Had he been drinking? ""She's gone. Really gone. Blocked my number, cleaned out her closet...""

""Isn't that what we wanted?"" I kept my voice gentle, soothing. The same tone I'd used all those times I'd counseled Camille through her marital problems. Problems I'd carefully orchestrated.

""I just... the way she looked at me...""

""Stefan, sweetheart."" I let steel edge into my sweetness. ""Are you having second thoughts? After everything we've been through?""

""No! No, of course not. I love you. I've always loved you.""

""Then stop calling me about your ex-wife. It's pathetic.""

I hung up, tossing the phone aside. Men were so predictably weak. Even Stefan, who I'd spent four years grooming before pushing him toward Camille, still needed constant management.

But he'd served his purpose. Just like everyone else in my carefully constructed game.

The family photo on my mantel caught my eye, my adoption day. I stood in the center, of course. Always the center. Camille pushed to the edge of the frame, trying so hard to smile through her insecurities.

God, it had been easy. Almost too easy.

A little whisper here about how Camille was unstable. A few concerned conversations with Mom about how worried I was about my dear sister's emotional state. Casual mentions to Dad about how Camille seemed to be struggling with basic adult responsibilities.

Fourteen years of careful groundwork, positioning myself as the responsible daughter, the achievable dream, while slowly crushing Camille's confidence, her relationships, her sense of self.

The college rejection was particularly inspired, if I do say so myself. All it took was one tearful conversation with Mom about finding Camille's ""secret"" diary, filled with dark thoughts and destructive plans. Plans I'd written myself, of course, in Camille's childish handwriting that I'd spent months practicing to forge.

Suddenly, their precious younger daughter wasn't ready for college. Needed time to ""find herself."" Needed to stay close to home where they could watch her.

Where I could watch her.

I took another sip of champagne, savoring the moment. Because this, this was what I'd really wanted all along. Not Stefan, he was just a useful pawn. Not the Lewis fortune, though that would come in time.

No, what I wanted was to watch perfect, precious Camille finally break. To see her realize that everything she thought she had family, love, security, had been built on my lies.

My phone buzzed with a text from Mom: ""Rose, darling, please come over. Your father and I need to talk about what happened.""

I smiled, already planning my performance. The tearful confusion, the reluctant confession about Stefan's pursuit, the gentle concern about Camille's mental state.

By the time I was done, they'd be thanking me for protecting them from their unstable daughter all these years.

Standing up, I walked to my closet, selecting the perfect outfit for my next scene. Something subtle but expensive. Grieving sister, not celebrating victor.

The massive walk-in closet had been Camille's wedding gift to me. ""So you'll always have space for your amazing fashion sense,"" she'd said, hugging me tight.

Even then, even after years of watching me steal every spotlight, every opportunity, every scrap of parental approval, she'd still loved me. Still trusted me.

Idiot.

I pulled out a cream cashmere sweater, remembering how Camille used to borrow my clothes in high school. How I'd wait until she had something important, a date, a presentation, an interview, then suddenly remember I needed that exact outfit.

She'd always given them back without argument. Always apologized for the inconvenience.

Always tried so hard to be the perfect sister.

My reflection caught my eye, and for a moment, just a moment, I saw something ugly there. Something that looked like the scared, angry foster kid who'd walked into the Lewis house all those years ago.

But then I blinked, and I was perfect Rose again. Flawless Rose. Rose who could do no wrong.

Slipping on my Cartier bracelet, another gift from my dear sister, I prepared for my next performance. The concerned family meeting would need just the right touch of reluctant honesty, devastated betrayal.

""Oh, Camille,"" I whispered to my reflection, practicing my worried frown. ""What have you done to yourself?""

But as I turned to leave, something made me pause. That look in Camille's eyes before she'd walked out, I'd never seen it before. Not in twenty years of pushing her, testing her, breaking her.

It had looked almost like... understanding.

Like she'd finally seen through my mask to the truth underneath.

I shook off the uneasy feeling. Camille was weak, just like I'd made her. She'd run away, lick her wounds, maybe try to start over somewhere new.

But she'd never be free of me. I'd made sure of that years ago.

# Chapter 4

STEFAN'S POINT OF VIEW

The scotch burned going down, but I poured another anyway. My third? Fourth? I'd lost count somewhere between signing those divorce papers and watching Camille walk away.

Our wedding photo still sat on my desk, mocking me. Camille's genuine smile, my distracted eyes,  already looking past her, always looking for Rose.

Rose.

Even her name felt like betrayal now.

My phone lit up with another message from her: ""Darling, stop drinking and come over. We should celebrate.""

Celebrate. Like we hadn't just destroyed someone who loved us. Someone who'd given me three years of devotion I never deserved.

The memory hit me like a punch to the gut.

\---

""Stefan?"" Camille's voice was small, uncertain. ""Did I do something wrong?""

I looked up from my laptop, irritated at the interruption. She stood in the doorway of my home office, holding a plate of something that smelled amazing.

""I made that pasta you mentioned. The one with truffles?"" Her eyes were hopeful. ""Rose gave me the recipe...""

Of course she had. Rose had made that pasta for me in Rome, years ago. Back when we were... whatever we were.

""I'm busy."" I didn't even look at the plate. ""Just leave it.""

""Oh."" A pause. ""It's just, you've been working late all week, and I thought...""

""Camille."" My voice sharp with an anger that wasn't really meant for her. ""I said I'm busy.""

She left the plate and disappeared, quiet as always. The pasta sat untouched until morning, a perfect recreation of a memory that belonged to another woman.

\---

I hurled my glass at the wall, watching crystal shatter like the life I'd built on lies.

God, I'd been cruel. Not just at the end, but throughout our marriage. Every missed dinner, every forgotten anniversary, every time I'd chosen work over her, all excuses to avoid the guilt of wanting her sister.

My phone buzzed again. Mother this time.

""Darling, I just heard from Rose. Are you alright? Do you need anything? I always said Camille wasn't suited for our family...""

I silenced the phone, remembering another moment I'd tried to forget.

\---

""She's trying so hard, Stefan."" Rose's voice was gentle as she poured me another drink. We were alone in my office after another disastrous family dinner. ""Maybe if you gave her more guidance...""

""Like you did?"" I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. ""Teaching her all the ways to be perfect?""

Rose's laugh was musical, practiced. Everything about her was practiced. ""Are you saying you preferred me imperfect?""

The air between us crackled with unspoken history. Four years of passion and plans, ended by her sudden departure to London. Or so she'd claimed.

""Why did you really leave?"" The question slipped out, colored by whiskey and old pain.

""You know why."" She touched my cheek, familiar and forbidden. ""Camille needed a chance at happiness. We both agreed...""

Had we? I couldn't remember anymore. Everything from that time felt hazy, manipulated. Like watching a play where I'd forgotten my lines.

""She loves you,"" Rose whispered, too close now. ""More than I ever could.""

But her eyes said something different. They always had.

\---

Another memory surfaced, this one from last week. The moment everything changed.

\---

""I made your favorite breakfast."" Camille's smile was bright, genuine. Always so damn genuine. ""Happy anniversary.""

The divorce papers burned in my briefcase, Rose's perfume still lingering on my clothes from our late-night ""meeting.""

""I can't."" I grabbed my keys, avoiding her eyes. ""Early meeting.""

""Oh."" Her voice cracked slightly. ""Will you be home for dinner? I thought we could...""

""Don't wait up.""

I'd spent that evening with Rose, planning how to break the news. She'd worn the same perfume she'd worn in Rome, all those years ago.

""It's kinder this way,"" she'd said, stroking my hair. ""A clean break. Camille will understand eventually.""

Would she? The look in her eyes when she'd seen Rose's photo...

\---

My office door opened, startling me from the memory. Mother stood there, perfectly coiffed even at midnight.

""Really, darling. Drinking alone in the dark?""

""Not now, Mother.""

She clicked across the room, surveying the broken glass with disapproval. ""Rose is worried about you. We all are.""

""Worried?"" I laughed, harsh and broken. ""Like you were worried about Camille all these years?""

""That girl was never right for you."" Mother's voice hardened. ""Rose, on the other hand...""

""Stop."" I stood, unsteady. ""Just... stop.""

""Stefan Rodriguez, you will not speak to me that way. I raised you better...""

""Did you?"" The words exploded out of me. ""You raised me to what? String along a woman who loved me while pining for her sister? Listen to you tear her down at every opportunity?""

Mother stepped back, shocked. In twenty eight years, I'd never raised my voice to her.

""Everything she did was wrong, wasn't it?"" I continued, the scotch making me brave. ""Her clothes, her manners, her cooking. Nothing was ever good enough. But Rose... Rose was perfect.""

""Because she understands our world! She...""

""She understands manipulation."" The truth hit me like a freight train. ""She played us all. You, me, Camille...""

""Don't be ridiculous."" Mother straightened her designer jacket. ""Rose loves you. She always has.""

Had she? Or had she loved the game more?

I remembered the cold calculation in her eyes when she'd orchestrated our ""chance"" meetings after returning from London. The way she'd encouraged Camille's insecurities while playing the supportive sister.

Even our reunion two months ago felt staged now. The charity gala, Camille conveniently ""sick,"" Rose in that dress I'd loved in Rome...

""Mother."" I sank back into my chair, suddenly exhausted. ""Please leave.""

""Stefan...""

""Go. Tell Rose... tell her..."" What? That I was sorry? That I finally saw through her perfect mask? That I'd destroyed my marriage for a fantasy she'd carefully crafted?

Mother left, her disappointment hanging in the air like expensive perfume. Like Rose's perfume. Like all the artificial, manipulated pieces of this life I'd chosen.

My phone lit up with another message. Rose again: ""Darling, stop being dramatic. Come home. To me.""

Home.

I looked around my office, at the shattered glass and scattered papers. At Camille's wedding photo, her genuine smile now seeming like an accusation.

What had I done?

# Chapter 5

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW

The parking garage of the hotel where i lodged was too quiet. My heels echoed against concrete, each click bouncing off empty cars and shadowed pillars. It was late, past midnight,  but something felt wrong. Off.

My confrontation with Rose and my family had left me drained, empty except for the cold satisfaction of finally seeing behind her mask. I fumbled with my key fob, wanting nothing more than to get to my hotel room and plan my next move.

A car door slammed somewhere in the darkness.

I stopped, listening. Nothing but the hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of traffic.

My phone buzzed in my purse. Rose's number. I declined it, but not before noticing my signal had dropped to one bar.

Perfect.

Footsteps behind me. Multiple sets.

I walked faster, cursing my choice of heels. The hotel's elevator was just around the corner, past a row of concrete pillars. If I could just...

""Going somewhere, Mrs. Rodriguez?""

A man stepped out from behind a pillar. Tall, broad-shouldered, dressed in black. Professional. Two more appeared behind me, cutting off my retreat.

Not a random attack, then.

""Actually, it's Ms. Lewis now."" My voice stayed steady despite my racing heart. ""And I have a dinner reservation, so if you'll excuse me...""

The first man smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. ""I'm afraid your plans have changed.""

I gripped my purse tighter, feeling for the pepper spray I'd started carrying after signing the divorce papers. ""Did my sister send you? Or was it Stefan?""

""Our employer prefers to remain anonymous."" He stepped closer. ""Now, we can do this the easy way...""

I didn't let him finish. The pepper spray caught him directly in the eyes.

He screamed, stumbling backward. I ran, kicking off my heels as I sprinted for the elevator. The other two men shouted, their footsteps thundering behind me.

Almost there. Just a few more...

Pain exploded in my scalp as someone grabbed my hair, yanking me backward. My purse went flying, contents scattering across the concrete.

""That wasn't very nice."" The first man's voice was rough with pain and rage. ""Hold her.""

Strong hands gripped my arms. I fought, kicking, scratching, but they were too strong. Professional. Trained.

""Our employer said you might be difficult."" The first man wiped his streaming eyes. ""Said you needed to learn your place.""

Rose. This had Rose written all over it. Her parting shot, making sure I understood just how powerless I really was.

""If you're going to kill me,"" I spat, ""at least have the guts to look me in the eyes.""

He laughed. ""Kill you? No, no. Just a message. A reminder of what happens to people who don't know when to let go.""

The first punch caught me in the stomach, driving the air from my lungs. I doubled over, gasping, but the men holding me kept me upright.

""See, some people don't understand their role in life."" Another blow, this one to my ribs. ""Some people need to be taught...""

I tasted blood. My vision blurred, pain shooting through my body. But I wouldn't cry. Wouldn't give Rose the satisfaction.

""That's enough.""

The voice cut through the garage like a whip crack. Female. Authoritative.

My attackers tensed. Through swollen eyes, I saw dark figures emerging from the shadows. Men in suits, moving with military precision. And behind them...

A woman. Tall, elegant, probably in her fifties but with an ageless quality about her. She wore a black designer suit that probably cost more than my car, her silver hair swept into a perfect chignon.

But it was her eyes that caught me. Sharp, intelligent, and oddly... familiar.

""Ma'am,"" one of my attackers started, ""our employer...""

""Is about to have a very bad day."" The woman's voice was ice. ""Release her. Now.""

The hands holding me disappeared. I slumped forward, pain shooting through my ribs.

""Secure them."" The woman's command sent her men moving. My attackers didn't even try to run. They knew better.

She walked toward me, heels clicking on concrete. Designer shoes. Probably cost more than my monthly rent.

""Camille Lewis."" Not a question. She knew exactly who I was.

I tried to straighten, to maintain some dignity despite my split lip and torn dress. ""Do I know you?""

Her eyes softened, just slightly. Like she was seeing something, someone  else in my face.

""No."" She gestured, and more men appeared with a medical kit. ""But I knew someone very much like you, once. Someone who also had to learn the hard way about trust and betrayal.""

The world was getting fuzzy around the edges. Blood dripped onto my ruined dress, each breath sending knives through my ribs.

""Who..."" I swayed, darkness creeping in. ""Who are you?""

She stepped forward, catching me as my knees buckled. This close, I could smell her perfume, something expensive, unique. Something that tickled at the edges of my memory.

""Someone who's been watching you for a very long time, Camille."" Her voice seemed to come from far away. ""Someone who's going to help you become everything they tried to prevent.""

The darkness was winning now. But before it took me completely, I heard her last words:

""After all... you look just like my daughter.""

Then nothing but black.

1ogb1ad,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ogb1ad,Just built AnyCameo - Create Personalized Cameos in 2 minutes for 5usd,"I've been working on a side project called AnyCameo, and I'd love to get your feedback. My goal was to create a platform that makes it easy to get personalized AI video messages from iconic characters without the hassle of subscriptions or waiting.

AnyCameo generates custom video messages from characters like Einstein, Santa, Sherlock Holmes, T-Rex, meme legends, and 27 others. You can even upload your own character, art, a toy, your pet, or a person. You simply choose your character, add the recipient's name and message (up to 150 characters), and the video is created instantly.

I built this because I noticed that existing AI video tools require subscriptions or have gated access. Sometimes you just need Einstein to deliver a birthday message to your friend, or Santa to send a personalized holiday greeting, and you need it now, not in hours or days like traditional cameo services.

The platform uses GPT-5 to optimize your prompt and write natural dialogue, then Veo 3.1 creates an 8-second vertical video with full audio. You get an immediate download link with no watermarks and no forced posting. Share it wherever you want: TikTok, IG Reels, X, or just text it directly.

It's $5 per video with no subscription required.

Check it out here: [https://anycameo.com/](https://anycameo.com/)

Thanks in advance for taking the time to try it out and for sharing your feedback!

I don’t know what’s wrong with me but today I decided go pull all my Stater Brothers receipts since March of 2024. 

I tracked every purchase: what the items were, when I bought them, and what I paid for it. I then categorized all items in to main categories and sub-categories. 

Here are the data charts for each category and subcategory. The X axis represents the month/year of purchase and the Y axis represents the average cost of items in that category. 

Now I in no way have any idea what I’m doing with excel so this doesn’t look the best but I found the data interesting. I also in know way know anything about analyzing data, again just found the results interesting. 

Notably, September 2025 was the only point in time where almost all categories increased all at the same time. Does anyone have any idea what would have driven this across the board increase on all goods all at once?

Finally went NC after decades of this nonsense (have done it before) and she was texting every week with the same ""sweet"" stuff like how she would love to see me, never asking WHY i am ignoring her or what she did wrong to make me go NC.

I finally responded out of sheer frustration and to be honest, to alleviate all guilt in case she did not know why, i outlined all the reasons, told her she never apologises or takes accountability and never changes. Said everything i wanted to say. Felt better for a day then she replied 2 days later with a basic "" i think we should talk and try and resolve all that has happened. I am free most days. hopefully will see you soon""

NO APOLOGY or acknowledgement, when i was quite clear i was upset she never apologises or changes and nothing is ever her fault. 

I ignored her response, sat with it...she texted again 2 days later as if nothing ever happened like we are fine.

""Just wanted to say hello and thought perhaps you would like to come over for a cup of tea or coffee this afternoon, hope to see you soon, mum "" and a love heart. 

WTF? I feel like i wasted all that time and effort outlining in GREAT DETAIL how hurt i am and how upset i am that she never apologises or changes or takes accountability, and those are the responses i get from her via text. 

I guess i was stupidly hoping to change the situation, like if i explain it all like she is a child she will get it and say sorry, but didn't, of course

No idea what to do now, i feel like she is forcing my hand, like i have no choice but to either go NC for good or accept her how she is without ever getting an apology.

From being a trending influencer to a wannabe actress - she has done nothing of substance in the past one or two years.

Her being a sidekick in movies doesn't concern me - she is not 'leading-lady' material, but what concerns me is the new Bata footwear ad. There are three actors/models in that ad and Kusha is one of them, sharing the same screentime. She plays the third fiddle - her presence doesn't stand out at all.

After all these years, after all this fame, after having coffee with KJO and starring in mainstream films and webseries, the least one can expect this is that when Kusha signs an ad, she will lead it - that she will be in focus and not in passing.

Hence, the question: what's her plan? Because whatever she is trying to do or whatever she has done just feels futile. Her entrepreneur-venture too seems like an overcompensation for her failed career in Bollywood - and though I hope it takes off, I doubt it hardly will.

1ogavr6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ogavr6,Guys it's ok I'm ancestrally Romanian so I can make these jokes,"Footnotes:

If you're wondering why I wrote Warin instead of Wario, it's because quite a few masculine Romanian names end in ""in"" (e.g. Dorin, Cătălin, Sorin, Codrin, Alin).

The bit about Andy's Pizza was removed because I realised soon after that Andy's Pizza is a Moldovan thing and not so much a Romanian one.

As for the smoking, it was moreso a stereotype in the late 20th century than it is today (apparently a cigarette and a coffee was known as a ""Romanian lunch"", this was because the poverty/food scarcity ensuing from Ceaușescu's restrictive economy and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc drove many to consume cigarettes). But believe me, downtown Bucharest is still rank with the smell of smoke.

If you're wondering how I made this, Waluigi and Wario were drawn by hand and outlined with a calligraphy pen, then the image was scanned and coloured in digitally then overlaid to the background image in a free version of Photopad (I'm too cheap to buy Photoshop).

1ogau6x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ogau6x,That Time a Nun Faked Her Own Death So She Could Shack Up With a Lover,"In 1318, a young nun known as Joan of Leeds had had quite enough of convent life. Sure, convent life afforded a woman niceties like a roof over one's head, healthcare and regular food, but it wasn't for everyone. Poverty, chastity and obedience aren't everyone's jam, then or now. So, with a little help from her friends and some ingenuity, Joan crafted an escape plan. 

Joan ""fell ill"" and ""died"" and then with more than one accomplice arranged for Joan's ""body"" to be buried at a public funeral, the body being a dummy that Joan herself seems to have fashioned from a variety of materials. She was later found living in sin with a man in Beverely, though it isn't known whether she was forced to return to her convent. 

The reason we know about Joan of Leeds is through an exasperated letter written by the Archbishop of York, William Melton. The put-upon bishop wrote to the authorities in Beverely: 

*'Out of a malicious mind simulating a bodily illness, she pretended to be dead, not dreading for the health of her soul, and with the help of numerous of her accomplices, evildoers, with malice aforethought, crafted a dummy in the likeness of her body ... \[she had\] no shame in procuring its burial in a sacred space ... She perverted her path of life arrogantly to the way of carnal lust and away from poverty and obedience. Having broken her vows and discarded the religious habit, she now wanders at large to the notorious peril to her soul and to the scandal of all of her order.""*

So, apparently, [faking your own death](https://www.reddit.com/r/History_Mysteries/comments/1o0bex5/a_short_introduction_to_the_king_edward_ii/) and/or having someone fake it for you may have been something of a trend in England of the 1310s-20s. 

One thing that seems clear is that Joan was not only helped by her friends to escape, she was living with her lover fairly openly. Was this a great romance? Did she get her happily ever after? Or was she forced to return to monastic life? One hopes she kept her freedom, and though that hope might be optimistic, she seems to have been an optimistic sort of person. Her friends also supported her, which is lovely to think about.

1ogasw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Internationalteachers/comments/1ogasw8/sedbergh_vietnam_bilingual_canadian_international/,Sedbergh Vietnam - Bilingual Canadian International School,"This is the first ever review of a school that I have made.

Sedbergh School in HCMC. A school in name only. Last year at least it was led by qualified professionals. Last year’s principal brought at least seven properly qualified, colleagues, friends and even family. A team with the knowledge, experience, professionalism and commitment to at least try to give the school some of the standards of a UK school. However all of these people were forced to resign at the end of last year.

Last year the school was forced to be managed bad, by the Vietnamese hierarchy, through the P & C (Human Resources) department, the general managers and up to and including the CEO, Mr Toan. The SLT were not allowed to do what they wanted to do and what the school needed.

This year, as soon as the first week, it was clear to all returning staff, including all the Vietnamese staff that I know, that things were immediately worse. Many teachers who had plans to return, did not arrive, rumors were that they had been threatened by the new leadership team and the P & C department to resign ‘or else’. One of the teachers that returned lasted a month and then mysteriously ‘left’. Another arrived back in Vietnam the week before the start of school and did not even start school, just got a flight back home the following week.

Other teachers have been threatened with the ultimatum, ‘or else’. Some of these have chosen to stand their ground and as a result been given, warnings and written warnings for missing duties they had not even been scheduled to do and other ridiculous reasons. Some have been shouted at by the ‘so called leadership’ in front of the students and in front of staff. One of the most surprising things is how many Vietnamese staff complain to their colleagues about the leadership team. I have worked in many schools in Vietnam and I have never even herd of one complaint from the Vietnamese staff.

I say ‘so called leadership’ because Joseph has only had five or six years experience teaching music. No managerial or leadership qualifications, his Vietnamese wife who is also a ‘manager’ has seemingly no qualifications or any experience except being married to him, even the Vietnamese staff think that she is a waste of space. Shaun has only a few years experience teaching ESL. None of these have any interpersonal skills whatsoever. Dr Minh is also a ‘leader’ who hides in his office all day. All of these seem to be controlled by Hong of the P & C department, and probably she is controlled by other Vietnamese that know nothing about how a school should be run.

We have had six changes in our schedules within less than three months. Teachers after weeks of teaching their classes have been moved to teach different classes. How on Earth can there be any professional teacher/pupil relationships made in these conditions. I hope that the parents read this. After three months there are still no clubs for students, I think the parents actually pay to have these clubs. I know that some of the parents are paying to have a Cambridge education. All teachers, even those teaching the same subjects, had to make their own scheme of work for their classes, not following the Cambridge curriculum. With lesson plans prepared nine weeks in advance, a total lack of understanding of what a lesson plan is actually for.

Many teachers are now openly looking for new jobs, and already saying that they will not be returning next year. I am now one of them! There are no real resources.

Staff now need to ask permission to leave the campus to get a coffee, go for a cigarette, and even to have their lunch outside of school. The problem is if you request to leave on the online form, there is no reply before the time you wish to leave, so immediately you have to break the rules or go hungry. Failure to get permission can lead to disciplinary measures!

Can all this really be true? Oh yes. Here is the story of one member of staff, a returning teacher this year, and how he is being treated. He says that he doesn’t care who knows now and he will make it all public. I will not mention his name but staff at the school including the Vietnamese staff will know of this, as what he has gone through scares them and some are even ashamed of how he has been treated.

Before the school year even started Joseph, Hong and Dr Minh issued threats against his career if he would not resign there and then. That sounds bad enough but they also threatened that his two kindergarten children would not get their education! How low can a school go? Was this an idle threat? No! for the first two weeks Hong told the kindergarten school he did not work here anymore, when he obviously did. They removed all his teaching classes so he was getting a teacher’s salary without doing any teaching. Then in less than a month he was in a discipline hearing and they refused to even let him have a lawyer.

Why am I writing this about him, in support of him? He has my full respect and some of the things he has done defy belief. I heard a few weeks ago that he had gone to China to rescue a Vietnamese girl from human trafficking. I know this is true because I have seen the Facebook messages from years ago. I am in awe of him, and this school is treating him with such distain. They should treat him like a hero, he should be considered a hero by all of Vietnam. How many people do you know that has done the same? Would you?

He shows the ridiculousness of the school’s attacks on him and his family to all staff and this helps them and gives them confidence, as the school is now ran by fear alone.

This is the best one yet. He has just been to yet another discipline hearing and not the only member of staff going through one at the same time. He was taking his 5 year old daughter as his representative. I am laughing just thinking about it. But this multimillion dollar organization with a full legal team, refused to even let her in the room. Scared of a 5 year old. How pathetic can they be?

Apparently he was being disciplined for not filling out a form in August, a form that was not created and sent to staff until late October.

He does not need my help because he will never give up.

Would I recommend this school? Not a chance! The students are not getting the education they deserve. The parents are being hoodwinked into paying for an education that their children are not getting. This is not due to the teaching staff most are saddened and disheartened and unfortunately are now simply getting by anyway they can. There is very little enthusiasm in the teaching staff, they want to do their job properly but they are being held back by pathetic new rules and threats of discipline measures against them. Vietnamese staff now have to give up their lunch breaks to sit with the students.

Like I said before this is my first ever review of a school and I hope the parents read this. Then I hope the parents ask to see the qualifications of Joseph, his Vietnamese wife and Shaun. Every parent should receive at least half of the tuition fee back because the students are not getting the education that has been promised to them.

As for Joseph, his Vietnamese wife and Shaun I think they should resign effective immediately and allow someone more qualified to take over. Perhaps the 5 year old above, she could not do a worse job.

This school was bad last year but now it must be the worst school that I have ever worked in. Every day like all teachers I want all the students to do good but everyday it is heartbreaking to see what is happening.

This is only the tip of the iceberg so to speak, this school should be taken over or closed down. This is not a school it is simply a way to get money from the parents for nothing.

One last thing I have heard recently is that the plan is to get rid of all the expensive teachers and replace them with cheaper labor.

I was diagnosed with major Depressive disorder, suicidal ideation, general anxiety disorder and CPTSD.

I had a terrible childhood. I had kids very young. I was married to an abusive partner. I worked full time while being the main caregiver to 2 kids under 3. I had Suicidal ideation to the point where I collected pills nightly in a container just waiting for the ""right time."" What brought me to my senses was that my own mother had an attempt when I was 7 yo and I was so traumatized by it. They and my best friend found her own dad when she was 13 after his attempt and success. I realized I did not want my kids to suffer the same fate. So I called and got admitted. I was in the ward for 3 months. Had ECT 4x a week for all 3 months.

At first I woke up hurt and disoriented. After the first 2 weeks I'd eat a block of cheese, an apple, go buy myself coffee and carry on with the days programs even though i was permitted to rest that day. By month 3 I was feeling amazing. So amazing I couldn't believe i had checked myself into the pyschward.

It's been 8 years since. At the beginning I was told I was alot like dory from finding Nemo. I retold alot of stories. I was so forgetful. It lasted about a year. Now days I am happy, healthy and I own my own business. Have remarried, have 3 kids. I am on multiple boards as a director. I volunteer at my kids school. I do well. I still get bouts of depression. To be honest this year has been my worst year. My mom is dying from relapse and as she does im running my business and taking care of my kids. It's a horrible year but I am not struggling with suicidal ideation. I have mental clarity. I can cope. Yes there is some stuff m family brings up that is foggy. But when I ask details the fog lifts. And I remember myself. 

ECT changed the game for me. And if I ever got bad enough with my depression I would sign up again in a heart beat. My kids were 4 and 2. Now they're 13 and 11. I have another child. And I am so grateful every day that I chose not to leave them. It can work.",3,1761450189.0,ect,3,1.0,False

I (F16) live with my parents (F46 and M44) they do not work, they get disability aid through the government. I do work to help support them and I also am the only driver in the house. I also attend school online in a sad attempt to make me feel less stressed. I take them shopping and stuff because they can’t drive and I also cook a decent amount of the time. Today I worked an easy shift but still work in general ALWAYS makes me tired and grumpy. Normally after work I can keep myself in a relatively good mood for other but internally feel like shit but today I’ve been really struggling, it was an early shift and the store was PACKED today (I work at a Halloween store) I got yelled at for company policies I have nothing to deal with and the typical customer service experience. I came home and felt like shit but as usual put it aside. After I took them to the store today I just wanted either a monster or to take a nap. They said I couldn’t have either because I need to be up early tomorrow and If I sleep now I won’t sleep later and be tired for work tmr. I find this redundant because I know this, I’m tired my body needs sleep I understand the chance that if I go to sleep at 7pm I might wake up at 2/3am but I can go back to sleep grab a coffee before work and then sleep after work tmr. I didn’t fight on her with this though I thought it was dumb. I just played games and then got hungry. I asked my mom to make me a sandwich cus they didn’t make dinner and I’m tired as I said. I was hoping my mom would feed me, she asked me to make it instead and like alright I get that but like please ur my mom can you just make me the sandwich, she doesn’t work, doesn’t drive, or anything like that I do it for her so like a simple sandwich is all I ask for.

I’ve been trying to record vocals in all sorts of spaces, such as at my desk, in a small office, even in coffee shops. Ideally, I want to record into my phone or laptop, move around a little, maybe play some guitar while tracking. But my previous mic I’ve used ends up fighting me in some sort of way.

Wired mics tie me down, and wireless mics can be tricky as well. Sometimes there’s hiss, random delay, or interference. When I bring the recordings into my DAW, I spend too much time cleaning clicks, hums, and background noise. Half the time I feel like I’m doing audio work instead of writing or performing.

I’ve tried cleaning up my setup more times than I can count, but somehow every upgrade adds another adapter, another cable, another thing that can go wrong.

So recently I saw some posts about the **MAONO PD200W**, which apparently works both wired and wireless and can record dual tracks at once. It sounds promising, but I’d love to hear from people who actually used it. How bad is the noise floor? Does the wireless hold up? Can you really just pick it up and record without fighting cables or adapters?

Songwriters, musicians, home recorders — what’s your dream mic setup for mobile vocals? And if anyone has tried the PD200W, is it worth the hype or just another compromise?

1ogakhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/VasaiVirarNSP/comments/1ogakhv/short_story_the_vasai_skywalk/,[Short Story] The Vasai Skywalk,"All that remained of Shivam's world was a grayscale hum.

Anya went three years ago, taking the color and the peaceful silence with her.

The silence he had now felt like a vacuum that would burst his skull so he filled it with the harsh chalk-dust taste of sleeping medications that no longer worked and the endless streams of data he analyzed from nightfall until two in the morning. He swallowed these little white lies, which were now placebos, and then he stared at the ceiling till the sun seeped through his blinds.

At 2:30 AM, dazed in a purgatory like state, he made his way to the Vasai Skywalk. A steel-and-concrete bridge that hung between the huge, uncaring darkness and the city's glittering insomnia. And that was the first time, he saw her...

She was a smudge of negative space against the sodium vapor glow, a silhouette that resolved into a girl as he drew closer. She was in her twenties maybe. Her skin was the pale, almost luminous of a creature that has never known the sun. A torrent of long, black curls framed a face of sharp, delicate angles. She was leaning against the railing, not looking at the city, but at him.

""You look like you’re fighting it"" her voice was a whisper, like dry leaves skittering across stone. It wasn’t loud, but it cut through the hum in his head with surgical precision.

Shivam stopped, his heart a trapped bird against his ribs. “Fighting what?”

“Sleep.” She turned her head fully towards him. Her eyes were pools of such profound darkness they seemed to swallow the light.

Her milky thighs and toned legs started to make their way towards him as he begin to get more nervous. This was the first time anyone has showed any kind of proactive interest in talking with him, that too for a topic whose foundation he couldn't fathom.

“You clench your jaw. Your shoulders are so tight. You’re treating it like a surrender"" she said as she stopped just in front of him.

""Wha-What?""

""You know..."" a ghastly smile appeared on her lips ""Hunger and Sleeplessness may be the two of the greatest drugs that we can consume by putting in least amount of effort.""

Shivam's mind was buzzing with plethora of conflicting thoughts. First there was the nervousness of the sudden encounter with this absolutely mesmerizing girl, but then there was also the bizarre things that she kept on spouting and for what? What did she wanted out of him in the first place?

""Hunger… it makes the world sharp, doesn’t it? Colors become more vivid when you’re starving for them. And sleep… sleep is the great eraser. It blunts the edges of pain, of memory. It makes the unbearable, bearable. A convenient amnesia, night after night.""

“The weak choose amnesia” she murmured, her gaze holding his. “The strong choose to feel the hunger. To stay awake and see what lies in the cracks when the world is asleep.”

That was the first night. He didn’t sleep at all after.

He began to plan his nights around the skywalk. He stopped taking the pills. The initial exhaustion was a physical agony, a sandbag behind his eyes. But then, as the days bled into sleepless nights, a strange clarity emerged. The world *did* feel sharper, more intense, as she had promised. The buzz of a flickering tube light was a symphony. The taste of the black coffee he now lived on was a bitter, beautiful truth.

He saw her again, a week later, in the same spot.

“You’re different,” she said, and he preened under her approval.

“I’m seeing things more clearly,” he replied, his voice raspy from disuse. He told her about Anya. He told her about the hollow ache that the pills and sleep could never fill, only postpone.

“You were trying to fill a spiritual hunger with physical oblivion,” she stated, not unkindly. “A futile endeavor. You must lean into the emptiness. Let it carve you out. Only then can you be filled with something… purer.”

He started skipping meals. The gnawing in his stomach became a companion, a constant reminder that he was feeling, that he was alive in a way the sleeping, eating masses were not. He was a initiate into a sacred, sleepless order of one. His work suffered. His body became a gaunt frame draped in clothes that now hung loose. But he didn’t care. The only thing that mattered was the approval in her mesmerizing ghastly eyes during their nightly talks, as he begin to get more and more hypnotized by her.

She spoke of time as a river for the sleeping, and a vast, still ocean for the awake. She spoke of consciousness as a flame that most people kept sheltered under a bushel of dreams, but that could be made into a roaring inferno.

Weeks dissolved. Shivam was now a zombie in his office as his mind would rampantly engulf him with the thoughts of reaching out to the skywalk again and again. His hands trembled constantly. His thoughts sometimes fractured, showing him glimpses of shimmering, impossible geometries in the patterns of the floor tiles. He was starving. He was delirious. He was, for the first time in years, utterly consumed.

The final night, he didn’t even go to work. He walked straight to the skywalk, his body running on a final, desperate reserve. The world swam around him, colors bleeding and sounds distorting. He collapsed against the cold railing, his breath a ragged gasp.

And she was there.

She knelt before him, her pale face the only thing in focus. She was more beautiful, more real, than ever before.

“You’ve done so well, Shivam,” she whispered, her voice now the only sound in the universe. “You’re so empty now. So ready.”

She leaned in, and her lips met his. It was not a kiss of comfort, but of consummation. A searing, passionate connection that felt like the culmination of his entire life. In his hallucinatory ecstasy, he kissed her back with the last shred of his strength, his hands tangling in her long, curly hair.

But as they kissed, he felt a profound, pulling drain. The warmth was leaving his body, not in a wave, but in a torrent, sucked out through his mouth, his pores, his very being. The vibrant colors of his delirium faded back to grayscale, then to black. He could feel his body collapsing in on itself, the hunger he had cultivated now turning inward and devouring him. He was the feast.

The last thing Shivam saw before the darkness took him was not the face or memory of anyone in his life from all the time he existed in this world, but hers as a vision of sublime, terrible satisfaction. He had finally sated his hunger.

The next morning, the police found it. It wasn't a body, not really. It was a pulped-out carcass, desiccated and mummified, lying on the Vasai Skywalk. It looked as if it had been lying in the sun for decades, not a single night. There was no blood, no visible wound. Just an empty vessel, drained of everything that had once made it a man. The report would later call the cause of death ""unknown, extreme and rapid physical degradation,"" a medical mystery that would never be solved.",1,1761449590.0,VasaiVirarNSP,0,1.0,False

1ogai3v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ogai3v,Sunday Coffee talks ☕❤️,"COFFEE SIPS & STORY TIME: 

Back in dec, 2024 while thinking how can i make my coffee experience better and window shopping on Amazon, I came across Nescafe E coffee maker, thanks to the higher power that I didn't purchase that gimmick but, the question still remained the same ... What I can do to improve my coffee? 

For a person, who doesn't like going cafes .. i heard a few times about Blue Tokai, but was completely unaware about ""BYOC"" brew your own coffee? ☕ 
Poor me, thought only a hefty coffee machine can do that .. and my home doesn't have a space for one even till today, affording it or not is/was always a secondary question

in January 2025, while scrolling reddit, I still don't remember how? But i ended up on a post that had a shiny bag of coffee with ""Ratnagiri Estate"" written on it, and that got printed in my head forever ... 
That same evening i licked the whole  ..
r/indiacoffee and whatever I thought was necessary for me to know.

Then from January to April... I only had one routine... Adding a coffee equipment in cart, then removing it & thinking i still don't need all of this ... But yet, there was a Dead end in my instant coffee journey, and the question of ""improvement"" used to end my day on a confusion note.

April, 2025 ... I finally decided to Shift, with cold brew being the safest option I picked Hario Mizudashi cold brew maker (1L) assuming that bigger = better? And a Bag of coffee from Quick Brown Fox coffee roasters ( contrary to how most people start with Blue Tokai.). A month passed and yet, something felt missing, maybe coz I am inclined towards milk coffees more? 

May, 2025 and I ordered myself Agaro Moka Pot a sampler from Blue Tokai. regardless of what people will say (self doubts?) found my go to thing in Moka pot finally ... Then i tried Araku, and instantly understood what the upper ladder was waiting for me.

June passed on slowly, but my chats & online time was being spent on r/indiacoffee mostly. I thought I can easily go for an year(first year), without a grinder .. but by this time there was a bery noticeable sale/price drops on Timemore grinders, and Everyday there were multiple posts of people buying those. Placed my order thrice, and cancelled... 

July, 2025 .. I bought 1zpresso Q Air, yes a grinder almost double the price of what I cancelled my c2 at, back in June and didn't wanted to waste expensive beans, so bought Fraction9 everyday gold for the learning curve of grinder.

Conversations grew, and by August, I honestly loved getting those small thanx for suggestion messages only to know that my recommendations were working for people... From suggesting someone particular bag of ""baarbara"" as he wanted to try the estate ... To helping that same person in grabbing Cafflano Kompresso at half price , suggesting first international coffee to someone, getting my first international bag ... Honestly? i guess Aug. Was best for me ... 

And now here I am ... Just reading & reading & reading more about ""processing"" and varietals ... Personal suggestion to people on the bases of long ass chats ....

And working on a coffee roasters directory and I am sure, a few of you already have link to that webapp I am working on .... So far, I have fetched 50+ roasters, with 800+ products out of which 600+ odd might be coffee fetchings...


TLDR: OP went from almost buying a Nescafé gimmick to becoming a full-blown coffee enthusiast. Started with cold brew, found love with a Moka pot, then splurged on a 1zpresso grinder after much deliberation. Now deep into varietals, processing, and even building a coffee roaster directory, all thanks to r/indiacoffee. August was peak ""coffee advisor"" vibes! ☕️📈

Signing off untill next brew ❤️

Experts warned of a radical new threat to global security after the Daily Mail tracked down more than 150 of the highly dangerous extremists to a luxury hotel in Cairo.

Israel was forced to empty its prisons of nearly all its most feared jihadists held on life sentences as part of Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan.

Some 154 of the 250 fanatics who were freed are currently staying in the Marriott’s five-star Renaissance Cairo Mirage City Hotel in the Egyptian capital, a Daily Mail investigation has found.

Families can still book in to stay at the hotel without being aware of the dangers.

Undercover journalists booked into the resort and stayed amongst the murderous jihadists, who include a member of Isis and a senior Hamas special forces commander.

Today we publish shocking images showing these hardened killers and extremists living in the lap of luxury beside sunbathing Western tourists.

The Daily Mail understands that some may soon be moved on to live in nearby tourist destinations such as Qatar, Turkey and Tunisia which are hugely popular with British holidaymakers. 

The Daily Mail understands that the convicted terrorists will apply for local visas and residence permits to be able to melt back into society, although they will be monitored by local security services.

Professor Anthony Glees, emeritus professor at the University of Buckingham, said: ‘These people are our sworn enemies. They will cut off the heads of British soldiers and kill left, right and centre.

‘We must not let them collect together. There can be no hiding place for these people. Otherwise you are setting up a terrorist army in exile – it will be Hezbollah 2.0.’

A former Israeli intelligence officer known as Guy C added: ‘There are no restrictions on their movements in these countries.

‘They can walk freely, travel to Europe – even the UK – receive donations from naive supporters, and gain backing from protestors who already sympathise with them.

‘The first thing these terrorists will do when they reach Turkey or Qatar is contact their associates in Gaza and the West Bank to send money and re-establish their networks. They will quickly regroup and form new terror cells.’

The release of 250 of the most dangerous terrorists serving life sentences was a key sticking point in the deal for Israel, which was strongly opposed to their release.

But it was ultimately deemed to be the only way to persuade Hamas to hand over the last 20 living Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire as one of the first stages of Mr Trump’s peace plan.

After their release, there are now only 20 Palestinian extremists serving life sentences left in Israeli prisons.

Of the most serious terrorists freed by Israel earlier this month, 154 were considered too dangerous to remain in the West Bank or Gaza.

As a result they are now being held in Egypt at the Mirage City Hotel, which has its own spa, fitness centre, restaurants, outdoor pool and even a hair salon.

Those staying at the resort, where rooms start at £200 per night, include Mahmoud Issa, 57, who founded Special Unit 101 of the Izz a-Din al-Qassam Brigades, a Hamas special forces unit in Hamas which specialises in kidnap.

His incarceration was a particular cause of complaint for Hamas chief Yahya Sinwar who was upset that Issa was not freed alongside him in 2011. Sinwar launched the October 7 atrocity in part to take enough hostages to force Israel to free the likes of Issa, who had been in jail since 1993. 

Others staying at the luxury hotel include Isis member Izz a-Din al-Hamamrah, 47, who recruited suicide bombers and planned hijackings; bus bomb mastermind Samir Abu Nima, 64; ambusher Muhammad Zawahra, 52; kidnapper Ismail Hamdan, 57; and murderer Yousuf Dawud, 39.

David Mencer, from the Prime Minister of Israel’s Office, said: ‘These men are terrorists, convicted of bombing buses, murdering students and kidnapping teenagers.

‘Israel freed them not to reward evil but because we value human life above all.’

‘A bitter price, but one our people have paid across the ages to reclaim kin from the hands of Jew-haters.’

It is not known whether any of the hotel staff were aware of the infamy of the men staying with them.

The Marriott hotel group did not respond to requests for comment.

To stroll through the luxury poolside courtyard at Cairo’s Mirage City Hotel feels like a taste of paradise.

European tourists soak up autumn rays under the blissful North African sun, watching as children play in the crystal-clear waters. Beside them, the Sol Pool Bar beckons for afternoon beers, Egyptian wine and freshly prepared local mezze.

Less than an hour from the pyramids, and just a short drive from the bustling city centre, this would appear to be the perfect spot from which families can safely explore the wonders of Egypt’s ancient capital.

But look a little closer and you will discover that all is not quite as it seems these days at Mirage City, part of the Marriott’s upmarket Renaissance chain.

For brushing shoulders with the usual guests at this opulent five-star resort are 154 convicted terrorists who last week poured out of Israeli jails, part of the extraordinary price the Jewish State was forced to pay for the release of its hostages in Gaza, held largely by Hamas.

Among those enjoying the facilities of the five-star complex is kidnap specialist Issa, 57; Isis member al-Hamamrah, 47; bus bomb mastermind Abu Nima, 64; ambusher Zawahra, 52; kidnapper Hamdan, 57; and murderer Dawud, 39.

Together they have killed dozens of people, yet remarkably the hotel – which describes itself as ‘perfect for family moments that matter’ – is still accepting bookings from the public.

Should you stay here and walk around the idyllic grounds, as the Daily Mail did, you will find that hateful eyes follow every step you take.

None were more sinister than those of Issa, who sat menacingly sipping coffee on his poolside balcony, our movements never escaping his glare.

When the Daily Mail checked into the hotel, we found ourselves in a room just a few doors down from one of Israel’s most dangerous inmates, who founded Special Unit 101 of the Izz a-Din al-Qassam Brigades, a Hamas special forces unit specialising in kidnap.

At breakfast unwitting tourists were seated near al-Hamamrah, who recruited suicide bombers and planned hijackings.

Just behind him, enjoying the extravagant buffet of fresh fruit, local pastries, unlimited coffee and a personal chef to cook you eggs any way you wish was Jihad al-Roum, 47.

He was part of a group of terrorists who befriended a Jewish teenager, lured him to the West Bank, and then stabbed and shot him to death in a murder that shocked Israel in 2002.

These extremists were celebrated at the luxury hotel. One of them, Akram Abu Bakr – responsible for dozens of shootings and bombings – even hosting his wedding in the grounds of the resort last Saturday.

Having been deemed too much of a threat to Israel to return to Gaza or the West Bank, instead the terrorists received a hero’s welcome from pro-Palestine groups in Cairo.

They spent much of their time posing for selfies with adoring local fans, who apparently have no problem with their record of killing and kidnap.

Many were seen withdrawing wads of cash from ATMs within the hotel as, after decades in prison, they are now rich. Thanks to the Palestinian Authority’s ‘Pay for Slay’ policy, under which people who commit terror attacks against Israelis receive up to £33,000 for every year they spend in jail, some have amassed six-figure fortunes, according to a report by Palestinian Media Watch.

It is not clear who has paid for their stay at the Mirage City Hotel. With rooms starting at £200 per night, the daily cost for all 154 of them will be upwards of £30,000.

Some say only Turkey or Qatar would have the means and the motivation to foot such a bill – but neither provided a comment in response to our requests.

Nor did the Marriott come back to us when we asked them for comment.

On the terrorists’ arrival huge crowds of friends, family and fans cheered as they entered the lobby before descending the spiral staircase to a function room beneath booked for the occasion.

Terrorist Mahmoud al-Arda, who killed an Israeli and masterminded the 2021 Gilboa Prison Break, was seen enjoying his first meal in a jubilant social media post that night.

Tucking into Middle East cheese, he said: ‘My first time with a spoon after four long years with local labneh from Arraba and thyme from the Arraba hills.’

When the Daily Mail arrived, muscled Egyptian secret police with pistols glistening under their jackets were seen patrolling outside and we understand they must grant permission for the freed prisoners to get trips out of the grounds.

But among those allowed to leave the hotel was Basem Khandakji, 41, who helped organise the 2004 Carmel Market bomb attack that killed three and injured over 50.

Despite personally driving a 16-year-old suicide bomber to the scene using his journalist ID to pass checkpoints, Khandakji is feted as a brave writer by pro-Palestine groups.

Last year he won the International Prize for Arab Fiction for his novel, ‘A Mask, The Colour Of The Sky’, and on a walk around Cairo he was invited to a book signing event at a local bookshop.

Pro-Palestine hangers-on were also seen clamouring for selfies at the hotel’s Sol Pool Bar with the notorious Jerusalem bus bomber Abu Nima.

He had languished in prison for nearly 40 years for the 1983 attacks, which killed six people including an 11-year-old child after he placed a charge near the rear of the vehicle.

While the terrorists’ ceremony was held in an indoor function room, an unconnected Christian couple had a separate wedding outside and, in a surreal moment, Abba’s Dancing Queen drifted across the courtyard where many of the Islamists were posing for pictures.

Come morning and they were reclining on sun loungers, fully clothed and glaring at Western tourists lying in bikinis by the pool just metres away from them.

While they have complained in interviews with friendly media outlets of being separated from their families in exile, the terrorists were seen passing their days with relatives who had flown to be with them.

Issa spent his time pacing the pool with women and young children, as well as sipping coffee with them on his balcony.

He was handed three life sentences and an additional 49 years in 1993 for multiple terror attacks including suicide bombings and the kidnapping and murder of Nissim Toldeano.

Considered one of the most dangerous prisoners in Israel, he was held in solitary confinement for more than 12 years after attempting to escape in 1996.

While Mossad – and the world’s other intelligence agencies – will undoubtedly keep a close eye on Issa, the sheer number of terrorists released is unparalleled.

It comes after scores of others were freed in previous ceasefires in November 2023 and January last year.

What steps are being taken to stop these men plotting together?

Throughout our time, all were constantly on the phone, or huddled together in hushed conversation trying to escape prying eyes.

In 2011 Israel felt that nearly 1,000 Palestinian prisoners for one soldier was a price worth paying, but the true cost was only felt when Sinwar launched Hamas’s barbaric attack on October 7, 2023.

This time Israel has gambled that by releasing only 96 of the worst prisoners back to the West Bank and Gaza, and deporting these 154 to Egypt, where they will be better protected.

But, as those hateful eyes at Mirage City are soon scattered across the world, you cannot help but question if the world will one day come to regret the price Israel was forced to pay for this peace.",3,1761449123.0,JewsOnTheRight,0,1.0,False

Anya went three years ago, taking the color and the peaceful silence with her. 

The silence he had now felt like a vacuum that would burst his skull so he filled it with the harsh chalk-dust taste of sleeping medications that no longer worked and the endless streams of data he analyzed from nightfall until two in the morning. He swallowed these little white lies, which were now placebos, and then he stared at the ceiling till the sun seeped through his blinds. 

At 2:30 AM, dazed in a purgatory like state, he made his way to the Vasai Skywalk. A steel-and-concrete bridge that hung between the huge, uncaring darkness and the city's glittering insomnia. And that was the first time, he saw her...

She was a smudge of negative space against the sodium vapor glow, a silhouette that resolved into a girl as he drew closer. She was in her twenties maybe. Her skin was the pale, almost luminous of a creature that has never known the sun. A torrent of long, black curls framed a face of sharp, delicate angles. She was leaning against the railing, not looking at the city, but at him. 

""You look like you’re fighting it"" her voice was a whisper, like dry leaves skittering across stone. It wasn’t loud, but it cut through the hum in his head with surgical precision.

Shivam stopped, his heart a trapped bird against his ribs. “Fighting what?”

“Sleep.” She turned her head fully towards him. Her eyes were pools of such profound darkness they seemed to swallow the light. 

Her milky thighs and toned legs started to make their way towards him as he begin to get more nervous. This was the first time anyone has showed any kind of proactive interest in talking with him, that too for a topic whose foundation he couldn't fathom.

“You clench your jaw. Your shoulders are so tight. You’re treating it like a surrender"" she said as she stopped just in front of him. 

""Wha-What?"" 

""You know..."" a ghastly smile appeared on her lips ""Hunger and Sleeplessness may be the two of the greatest drugs that we can consume by putting in least amount of effort.""

Shivam's mind was buzzing with plethora of conflicting thoughts. First there was the nervousness of the sudden encounter with this absolutely mesmerizing girl, but then there was also the bizarre things that she kept on spouting and for what? What did she wanted out of him in the first place?

 ""Hunger… it makes the world sharp, doesn’t it? Colors become more vivid when you’re starving for them. And sleep… sleep is the great eraser. It blunts the edges of pain, of memory. It makes the unbearable, bearable. A convenient amnesia, night after night."" 

“The weak choose amnesia” she murmured, her gaze holding his. “The strong choose to feel the hunger. To stay awake and see what lies in the cracks when the world is asleep.”

That was the first night. He didn’t sleep at all after.

He began to plan his nights around the skywalk. He stopped taking the pills. The initial exhaustion was a physical agony, a sandbag behind his eyes. But then, as the days bled into sleepless nights, a strange clarity emerged. The world *did* feel sharper, more intense, as she had promised. The buzz of a flickering tube light was a symphony. The taste of the black coffee he now lived on was a bitter, beautiful truth.

He saw her again, a week later, in the same spot.

“You’re different,” she said, and he preened under her approval.

“I’m seeing things more clearly,” he replied, his voice raspy from disuse. He told her about Anya. He told her about the hollow ache that the pills and sleep could never fill, only postpone.

“You were trying to fill a spiritual hunger with physical oblivion,” she stated, not unkindly. “A futile endeavor. You must lean into the emptiness. Let it carve you out. Only then can you be filled with something… purer.”

He started skipping meals. The gnawing in his stomach became a companion, a constant reminder that he was feeling, that he was alive in a way the sleeping, eating masses were not. He was a initiate into a sacred, sleepless order of one. His work suffered. His body became a gaunt frame draped in clothes that now hung loose. But he didn’t care. The only thing that mattered was the approval in her mesmerizing ghastly eyes during their nightly talks, as he begin to get more and more hypnotized by her.

She spoke of time as a river for the sleeping, and a vast, still ocean for the awake. She spoke of consciousness as a flame that most people kept sheltered under a bushel of dreams, but that could be made into a roaring inferno.

Weeks dissolved. Shivam was now a zombie in his office as his mind would rampantly engulf him with the thoughts of reaching out to the skywalk again and again. His hands trembled constantly. His thoughts sometimes fractured, showing him glimpses of shimmering, impossible geometries in the patterns of the floor tiles. He was starving. He was delirious. He was, for the first time in years, utterly consumed. 

The final night, he didn’t even go to work. He walked straight to the skywalk, his body running on a final, desperate reserve. The world swam around him, colors bleeding and sounds distorting. He collapsed against the cold railing, his breath a ragged gasp.

And she was there.

She knelt before him, her pale face the only thing in focus. She was more beautiful, more real, than ever before.

“You’ve done so well, Shivam,” she whispered, her voice now the only sound in the universe. “You’re so empty now. So ready.”

She leaned in, and her lips met his. It was not a kiss of comfort, but of consummation. A searing, passionate connection that felt like the culmination of his entire life. In his hallucinatory ecstasy, he kissed her back with the last shred of his strength, his hands tangling in her long, curly hair.

But as they kissed, he felt a profound, pulling drain. The warmth was leaving his body, not in a wave, but in a torrent, sucked out through his mouth, his pores, his very being. The vibrant colors of his delirium faded back to grayscale, then to black. He could feel his body collapsing in on itself, the hunger he had cultivated now turning inward and devouring him. He was the feast.

The last thing Shivam saw before the darkness took him was not the face or memory of anyone in his life from all the time he existed in this world, but hers as a vision of sublime, terrible satisfaction. He had finally sated his hunger. 

The next morning, the police found it. It wasn't a body, not really. It was a pulped-out carcass, desiccated and mummified, lying on the Vasai Skywalk. It looked as if it had been lying in the sun for decades, not a single night. There was no blood, no visible wound. Just an empty vessel, drained of everything that had once made it a man. The report would later call the cause of death ""unknown, extreme and rapid physical degradation,"" a medical mystery that would never be solved.

1ogacw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ourdarkestdays/comments/1ogacw8/duo_pairs_tier_list/,Duo pairs tier list,"Hi all. I've found the information on the starting characters a bit lacking so I thought I would post a summary here - more to follow.
I mainly play on hard for reference.

S TIER - nobody 
I'm leaving this empty for now. At present I don't feel any of the pairs are so far above the rest to be deserving of an s tier ranking.

A TIER - Penny and Daphne.
This ranking I carried exclusively by Daphne. Her cook/first aid skills allow players to skip recruiting frank and aubrey giving her a lot of value as a character - especially for long play through.
Penny's blade master isn't that useful as you oneshot everything in sneak mode anyway and should be fighting by zombies head on. I'm unsure exactly sure how the sneaky trait directly effects mechanics. The trauma state also makes brawling trickier.

B TIER - Sebastian and Dianne
Sebastian's range benefits aren't really felt until late in the game as range weapons require high level workbenches, by which time you've already stabilised your shelter. Morale is really not an issue with all the beer/moonshine so Sebastian is more of a 'standard survivor'. Still. His range weapons boost is unique in the game if you really really like guns.
Dianne provides most of the value in this pair with the optimist/untiring traits. You can extract for more labour per phase compared to any character because them. The poor craftsmen trait is slightly annoying when assigning labor but easy to play around.

C tier - Tracy and Wayne
This pair is as close to a 'vanilla' playthrough as you can get. Most of their traits have little/no impact on your game.
Morale is not an issue and you don't want Tracy on low hp to activate survivalist.

C/D tier - Hector and Kayla
This pair was by far the hardest to place and I've based them in large part on their early game usefulness.
They have good resource economy but it doesn't really help early game which is the most crucial part of the game.
Unfortunqtelt, their negatives are among th3 worst in the game.
Insomniac reduced your average labor available per night (coffee is essential) while reduced backpack space means that your loot runs are less efficient.



D TIER - Darrel and Leo
Darrels iron stomach trait is worthless as you shouldn't be eating raw meat anyway.
His whittler trait allows you to get good value crafting melee weapons which is important early game.
Leo's tough state and slugger state allows him brawl and loot more easily.
You should be aiming for stealth take downs anyway but when this isn't an option, his status as a  brawler is quite handy.
His ravenous appetite is a real problem both early game (especially with the bad cook trait on Darrel) and for longer 'save everyone' playthroughs.
If you're playing as this pair, early game is a real smash and grab where you're racing to clear and secure loot and build workbenches before Leo's hunger becomes an issue.",1,1761448898.0,ourdarkestdays,0,1.0,False

“Sleep.” She turned her head fully towards him. Her eyes were pools of such profound darkness they seemed to swallow the light. 

Her milky thighs and toned legs started to make their way towards him as he begin to get more nervous. This was the first time anyone has showed any kind of proactive interest in talking with him, that too for a topic whose foundation he couldn't fathom.

“You clench your jaw. Your shoulders are so tight. You’re treating it like a surrender"" she said as she stopped just in front of him. 

""Wha-What?"" 

""You know..."" a ghastly smile appeared on her lips ""Hunger and Sleeplessness may be the two of the greatest drugs that we can consume by putting in least amount of effort.""

Shivam's mind was buzzing with plethora of conflicting thoughts. First there was the nervousness of the sudden encounter with this absolutely mesmerizing girl, but then there was also the bizarre things that she kept on spouting and for what? What did she wanted out of him in the first place?

 ""Hunger… it makes the world sharp, doesn’t it? Colors become more vivid when you’re starving for them. And sleep… sleep is the great eraser. It blunts the edges of pain, of memory. It makes the unbearable, bearable. A convenient amnesia, night after night."" 

“The weak choose amnesia” she murmured, her gaze holding his. “The strong choose to feel the hunger. To stay awake and see what lies in the cracks when the world is asleep.”

That was the first night. He didn’t sleep at all after.

He began to plan his nights around the skywalk. He stopped taking the pills. The initial exhaustion was a physical agony, a sandbag behind his eyes. But then, as the days bled into sleepless nights, a strange clarity emerged. The world *did* feel sharper, more intense, as she had promised. The buzz of a flickering tube light was a symphony. The taste of the black coffee he now lived on was a bitter, beautiful truth.

He saw her again, a week later, in the same spot.

“You’re different,” she said, and he preened under her approval.

“I’m seeing things more clearly,” he replied, his voice raspy from disuse. He told her about Anya. He told her about the hollow ache that the pills and sleep could never fill, only postpone.

“You were trying to fill a spiritual hunger with physical oblivion,” she stated, not unkindly. “A futile endeavor. You must lean into the emptiness. Let it carve you out. Only then can you be filled with something… purer.”

He started skipping meals. The gnawing in his stomach became a companion, a constant reminder that he was feeling, that he was alive in a way the sleeping, eating masses were not. He was a initiate into a sacred, sleepless order of one. His work suffered. His body became a gaunt frame draped in clothes that now hung loose. But he didn’t care. The only thing that mattered was the approval in her mesmerizing ghastly eyes during their nightly talks, as he begin to get more and more hypnotized by her.

She spoke of time as a river for the sleeping, and a vast, still ocean for the awake. She spoke of consciousness as a flame that most people kept sheltered under a bushel of dreams, but that could be made into a roaring inferno.

Weeks dissolved. Shivam was now a zombie in his office as his mind would rampantly engulf him with the thoughts of reaching out to the skywalk again and again. His hands trembled constantly. His thoughts sometimes fractured, showing him glimpses of shimmering, impossible geometries in the patterns of the floor tiles. He was starving. He was delirious. He was, for the first time in years, utterly consumed. 

The final night, he didn’t even go to work. He walked straight to the skywalk, his body running on a final, desperate reserve. The world swam around him, colors bleeding and sounds distorting. He collapsed against the cold railing, his breath a ragged gasp.

And she was there.

She knelt before him, her pale face the only thing in focus. She was more beautiful, more real, than ever before.

“You’ve done so well, Shivam,” she whispered, her voice now the only sound in the universe. “You’re so empty now. So ready.”

She leaned in, and her lips met his. It was not a kiss of comfort, but of consummation. A searing, passionate connection that felt like the culmination of his entire life. In his hallucinatory ecstasy, he kissed her back with the last shred of his strength, his hands tangling in her long, curly hair.

But as they kissed, he felt a profound, pulling drain. The warmth was leaving his body, not in a wave, but in a torrent, sucked out through his mouth, his pores, his very being. The vibrant colors of his delirium faded back to grayscale, then to black. He could feel his body collapsing in on itself, the hunger he had cultivated now turning inward and devouring him. He was the feast.

The last thing Shivam saw before the darkness took him was not the face or memory of anyone in his life from all the time he existed in this world, but hers as a vision of sublime, terrible satisfaction. He had finally sated his hunger. 

The next morning, the police found it. It wasn't a body, not really. It was a pulped-out carcass, desiccated and mummified, lying on the Vasai Skywalk. It looked as if it had been lying in the sun for decades, not a single night. There was no blood, no visible wound. Just an empty vessel, drained of everything that had once made it a man. The report would later call the cause of death ""unknown, extreme and rapid physical degradation,"" a medical mystery that would never be solved.",1,1761448803.0,IndianTeenagers,0,1.0,False

*[Amelia has taken a job in which she lives on behalf of her client by transforming into him via transformation suit outfitted with a biometric watch.  After a mundane day of mild reputational ruin, Amelia stops for coffee in preparation for the second half of a double shift.  This is part one of the conclusion.]*

Staring down the barrel of another six hours as Logan, I stop at the coffee shop on Ninth for a pick-me-up.  I’ve learned at least half a lesson today.

Since I am once again encased within Logan’s body, I don’t want to turn this double into an overnight.  It isn’t that I mind sleeping as Logan.  I’ve done it before, but a whole day off is like running through an empty field of wildflowers.  I want to make the most of it, which means that I actually have to get up in the morning *as me*.

As I gaze at the menu, I’m startled by an abrupt and enthusiastic, “Hello!”

Behind me stands a middle-aged woman- huge, like a white version of Madea.  She’s well over six feet tall and is built like she could inadvertently snap my arm in half with a handshake.  Intimidating as she is, her visage is softened by a gentle, genuine smile.

“Oh man, I didn’t mean to scare you.  I’m sorry,” she has her hands up as if to signify peace, “I just noticed your watch.  Kymara?”

My momentary confusion slides directly into realization.  This woman has the same watch.

Oh my God.  

Another operator?

OhMyGodOhMyGodOhMyGod.

“Yes!” I’m ecstatic, “And you?”

“Yeah.”  She lets out an easy laugh, warm and unbothered.  “I’ve never met anyone else who does this.  I’m Pamela- well, when I’m on the job.”

She extends her hand.  I’m slack-jawed, processing the fortune of friendship that has surely been bestowed upon me.  Nevertheless, my social ineptitude has been defeated by my instinct to smile and return a handshake.  Thank goodness. 

“Oh, hang on.”  Pamela reaches into her bag and pulls out a Kymara ID.  “First impressions,” she says, a little sheepish.

But Pamela is not a “she” at all; Pamela is very much a “he”.  And Good Lord in heaven, this man is a criminal for masking *such* a gorgeous work of art.  The guy in the photo has tousled blonde hair, stunning blue eyes, and a jawline that could cut glass.  Adonis is probably jealous of him.

“My real name is Soren, by the way.  It’s great to meet you.”

“Same to you, Soren…” my heart is aflutter.  “I’m Amelia.”

“Amelia?  You’re a woman?”

“Yes,” I confirm as I pull out my own ID.  “At least I am when I’m off the clock.”

His eyes widen as he looks at my picture.

“Whoa,” he practically whispers before regaining his composure.  “You’ve been holding out.”  His lips curl up into a grin; he’s Pamela but I can see a man’s smolder burning right through.

“Thanks.”  Remember that field of flowers?  Yeah, every butterfly inhabiting that place has relocated to my stomach.

In an effort to distract myself, I redirect the discussion, “So do you like this job?”

“Yeah,” he says with a small smile.  “I actually do enjoy it.”

“Great!  What brought you into this line of work?”  If he asks, I’ll mirror whatever he tells me.  He doesn’t need to know about the futility of my web design degree.  That the young woman obsessed with crafting creative corners of the internet didn’t account for the automation of Adobe and coding.

“This was pitched to me as an acting gig,” he says, shrugging.  “I guess it kind of is.  You step into the character- literally.  What about you?  Are you an actor?”

Heat creeps up my neck.  Aside from school and the time I played an AIDS-addled junkie in *Rent*, my credentials hardly justify such a title.

“Only on the weekdays.”  Despite my career in cosplaying a sad lottery winner, I don’t want to oversell.  “Too many viewings of *Silence of the Lambs*, maybe, but as far as I understand you’re not supposed to relate to Buffalo Bill.”  Soren chuckles, but I internally dry-heave as my brain catches up to the fact that I just cracked a joke in favor of a skin-wearing serial killer.  So that’s nice and impressive of me.  Maybe next I can shove my head into an oven.  I’d humiliate myself less that way.  Let’s divert this conversation back to Soren, “And you act?”

“As a hobby, I guess.  Oh!  One of my clients hooked me up with a role in a dog food commercial though” he laughs, “look out, Hollywood.”

“Really?  That’s awesome!   Do you have many clients?”

“A few,” he says.  “It’s part-time, but the pay beats my real job.”

“Ooh, have you been anyone interesting?”

“Hmm, I’ve been a rich guy.  Stopped after realizing he was just using me to cover up his affairs.  Also a diplomat.  I don’t know anything I’m not supposed to, unfortunately.”  He’s looking up, trying to recall a totally different kind of body count, “I was this mukbang influencer a few times.  That was interesting- she was actually the one that hooked me up with the commercial.”

“She?  Wow, you fit into her?”  Female influencers tend to be small, and bioform suits cannot remove mass.  Soren looks like he is not small, which poses a logistical nightmare that I’m trying to square away.  Instead, I sound like I’m asking about Soren’s *sex*capades.  So much for my avoidance of unintended sexual harassment.

He raises an eyebrow and I mourn the fact that Logan isn’t more flexible.  At this moment, I desperately need to shove my foot into my mouth and they’re all the way down there.  I cannot be trusted to speak with other humans, as it turns out.

Mercifully, Soren did not take my question as an inquisition into what goes on between his sheets.  He looks more amused than creeped out.

“Tall women exist…” 

“Well, yes, of course they do.”  I am literally looking at one.  What the hell, Amelia?  “Sorry.”  I’m starting to feel like a newly pubescent boy discovering a girl for the first time, except three times as awkward.  Soren assures me that I’m fine, so I try to salvage our encounter (as well as my dignity), “So… did you make any videos for her, or..?”  I do not have confidence in my success.

“Nah, I went to an influencer convention though.”  He shoves his hands into his pockets.  All pretenses are gone; the sweet old lady act has evaporated into the man currently making my crotch blush.  “And you?  Do you like what you do?”

“Of course,” I respond.  I am not sure that I’m telling the truth at this point.  I have been neglecting my own life in order to help someone else neglect theirs.  And I don’t really know what to do with that.

“Next?”  The barista is ready for me.  

I order; Soren interjects in order to treat me.  As we wait for our beverages, Soren invites me to stay.

“Hey, you know I’d love to chat with you about all of this.  Do you have time?  Over a coffee?  I need to know where you got that awesome shirt.”

I’m reminded that *Home is Where the Wi-Fi Is* stretches across my chest.

Ugh.

My heart sinks.  I want nothing more than to stay, but I’m expected back at work.  I express as much, and Soren is unfazed.

“Breakfast then?  On me.”

“As ourselves?”

“As ourselves.”

YES.

We exchange details and I skip off to Logan’s with all the whimsy of a prairie girl.  I don’t know what will happen with Soren; I’ve finally met someone who might understand the strange duality that comes with this job.  Someone to remind me that I’m not alone.  

Right now, I need to remind someone else that *they* aren’t alone.  Of course, that’s only if he lets me.",2,1761448749.0,BodySwapMemes,0,1.0,False

1oga952,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1oga952/feeling_weird_about_bad_date/,Feeling weird about bad date.,"So I've been dating this guy since the middle of May. It has gotten pretty serious. I am learning ASL for him because he is Deaf. The relationship is exclusive, but we aren't official boyfriends. We tell each other we love each other.

Today we had a really bad date though. We are both artists, he actually has a graphic design degree, so painting, drawing, making art is something we both enjoy. So the plan was to take a walk on a short local trail to a nice spot to do some sketching and plein air painting.

I hadn't been to the spot in a while and there had been some changes to parking and entrance to the trailhead. So I struggled a little figuring out how to get to the trail so he wouldn't have to hike up and down a small hill.

I eventually found a spot on the level ground for us to park and we started on our walk. I told him he could pick somewhere along the trail he thought was a nice view to paint. He picked a spot after about 10-15mintues of walking. We laid out a blanket. We had gotten snacks and I had brought my bong, but I somehow forgot the bowl so we couldn't smoke it. We could only vape, snack, and make art. So we both snack and then start drawing but after about 5 minutes I look over to see he is crying. I dropped my brush, and just hugged him. Then I asked ""What's wrong?"" He explained what was wrong.

He hadn't brought his glasses, which is pretty common because they are older and he needs a new pair, but he thought it would be fine in the daylight that he would be able to see enough, but once he sat down he realized he couldn't see any details and that until he gets new glasses he doesn't feel like he can make art because he can't see well enough. I felt really bad because I would never want to take him to do anything that would make him feel bad.

So we packed up and went back to his place. We worked on a large puzzle we have been doing on his coffee table and then watched an episode of The Bear. I have dogs so I had to go home for a bit to take care of them and then the plan was to come back to his place for bed.

When I let him know I would be heading back over at around 830 or 9pm, like we planned he told me he was almost fell asleep. It was not even 7pm and he normally goes to bed at or after midnight.

I feel like I screwed up. I also feel like there must have been other things going on besides the bad date. Now, I am sitting in my bed lonely, wishing I knew how to make him feel better. Wishing we never went to that trail. Wishing I could read his mind. The worst part is I only decided to do this because I thought he wanted to go do something other than do a puzzle at home and watch TV.

I don't think I am good at relationships. I don't think I am good at dating. He seemed so excited before we got there. Idk if he expected something different from a ""trail by the river?"" He said thank you and that he enjoyed the walk after we left but he also said he still wanted to try drawing and painting but something simple, like buildings. I think buildings are complicated, but if I knew he wanted to draw buildings we could have stayed in the city. I told him next time he can pick where we go.

Idk, maybe I didn't ask enough questions. He is normally pretty forthright about his opinion. I am a little shocked by how much I feel like I must have pushed this plan on him.

I left my bong and weed at his place because I was expecting to spend the night. At least he has a bowl there he can use for it. So now I can't smoke tonight. Idk if I even should reach out to him tomorrow or if I should just give him space?",1,1761448544.0,gayrelationships,2,1.0,False

I knew from prior experience, this would lead to them trying to get me to attend a presentation. The offer was good enough, so I agreed to attend. I had no intention of buying, but since I had only ever been to the presentations in Las Vegas, I was interested to see how the presentations differed, if at all. I filled out the interest form, they gave me my packet and I was scheduled to attend the presentation later in the week.

Upon arriving at my scheduled time, I was given another form to fill out. I didn't notice the discrepancy between the forms regarding income and I checked the option that most closely represented my income. I returned the form and waited in the waiting area. One of the reps behind the desk came from behind the desk to verify if the income information was correct. I thought this was strange, but after confirming the info was correct, the rep returned to the check-in desk. Shortly after, another rep, this one in a business suit, came over and asked me to verify the income information was correct, She also asked for the copy I had in my packet of the original form. She informed me that I had checked two different things regarding my income and to clarify which one was more accurate. After doing so, she returned my forms to the check-in reps and I heard the check-in rep say ""And no gift."" The business suit rep shook her head no and left the lobby area.

So now we're 30+ minutes in and the check-in rep calls me up and says due to the income requirements, I wouldn't be able to take the tour and I was free to go. I responded with ""Excuse me?,"" and told her that surely I would be compensated in some fashion for my time. After the embarrassment of sitting in the lobby as others were called back to do their tours, I was going to get something other than coffee and snacks. I was told that I could talk to a member of the marketing team and to have seat. The marketing rep came and brought me to the marketing office. I explained the situation and the marketing rep left, but quickly returned. The marketing rep stated that due to the discrepancies between the two forms, they would honor the original offer and I didn't even have to take the tour! 

TL;DR - Form discrepancies led to embarrassing wait in the lobby and initial rescinding of offered gifts. After refusing to accept this, I was still given offered gifts and didn't have to take the tour. ",3,1761448447.0,HiltonGrandVacation,0,0.8,False

I’ve read so many posts and I think that this community is very engaging and supportive, and I’m looking for help and advice on my breaking and healing journey. I apologize for how long it is, but hopefully it helps some of you.

I (25M) have been trying to process a breakup that’s still been sitting heavy on my chest. I met “K” in November 2023 while I was in grad school and she was a junior in undergrad. I was 23 and she was 21. Our first date became three dates that day, it just kept going because of how effortless and connected it felt. I left that night thinking I’d met someone really special. Not long after, I learned she’d never had a healthy relationship before, she said every boyfriend she’d ever had had dumped her; and that her dad had passed away about seven or eight months before we met. We made it official in January 2024, and things felt perfect at first. But about a month in, in December 2023, she and her best friend took drinks from a guy at a club in New York City and she ended up being roofied. It was terrifying, and I supported her fully through it, but it also made me realize how tied she was to that partying lifestyle. That same month, I met her mother, and in hindsight, that explained a lot , her mom was enabling, always justifying her daughter’s behavior, downplaying her lack of accountability, and creating an environment where consequences didn’t really exist.

I’ve always struggled with anxiety and OCD, and after that December incident, it became hard not to worry whenever she went out. Even though I trusted her, I was constantly afraid she was one bad decision away from ruining everything we had. Still, I stayed because she told me she wanted a future with me — she talked about marriage, kids, and the life we’d build together. She knew those things mattered to me, and I loved her more than anything. I stayed for a year and a half, and honestly, if she hadn’t ended it, I probably still would have been staying.

Throughout the entire relationship, I gave her everything. I was loyal, thoughtful, and consistent. So much so that even her friends noticed, saying they’d never seen a man treat a woman like that before. My best friend started calling me the “Hallmark boyfriend.” But I never love-bombed her, I just genuinely cared. Even when she constantly prioritized her friends and nights out over me, I stayed patient. In March 2024, I remember telling her she’d stopped saying thank you, that she didn’t seem to appreciate me anymore. She admitted I was right and said she’d be better, and for about two weeks she was, but then it went back to the same thing. In that same conversation, she told me she wanted to have my baby someday, and hearing that melted me. It made me believe she truly saw a future with me, and I clung to that version of her.

By July 2024, she told me there was an “imbalance” in our relationship that I was doing too much and it made her feel like a bad girlfriend. She said she wanted me to do less so she could do more. I thought that sounded fair, but in reality, she didn’t step up, she just used it as an excuse to give less. In September, a week or two into the new semester, she started a fight with me over something trivial and ripped into me in public while we were walking to class. I remember walking away crying, thinking, “This is it, we’re going to break up.” We didn’t, but something cracked that day. By November 2024, she brought up the imbalance again and said we needed to fix things, but it always felt like I was the one trying to fix them. She compared me to her exes, talked about how she missed how things were at the beginning, and whenever she was upset, about me, her friends, or something else entirely, she’d take it out on me. I eventually told her she needed to stop treating me like her emotional punching bag.

When 2025 came around, I was still all in. Between January and March, I drove seven hours each way four or five times just to see her. I picked her up from the airport after her ski-house vacations for Christmas and New Year’s, first in January 2024 and again in January 2025. That second time, my sister, who has chronic health issues, was in the hospital, and I left my family to go pick K up. Looking back, that moment showed how much I prioritized her. We started doing “distance” in January 2025, though I was still spending as much time with her as I could. The real distance didn’t start until March 2025.

In January 2025, while my sister was hospitalized for three weeks, K told me she should still be my priority. I told her she was, but that I also needed to be a priority for her. Despite all my effort, traveling constantly to see her, showing up no matter what, she never once came to visit me. She wasn’t empathetic and instead guilt-tripped me about not giving her enough attention during one of the hardest months of my life. Around this time, she also became jealous and controlling. I had a close female friend from grad school, someone I’d known long before K, who had just gone through a breakup. K told me I couldn’t talk to her anymore unless I reported every conversation to her. I had to reassure her over and over that I only loved her, that my friend supported our relationship, and that I’d never cross a line. I felt like I was constantly walking on eggshells just to prove my loyalty to someone who already had it.

By March, when the real distance began, she started picking fights over tiny things and twisting conversations to make me feel like I was the problem. I was always the one apologizing and trying to make it right, even when she caused it. I kept thinking that if I just showed her more love or patience, we could get back to how it was. But it never worked. After I saw her that month, everything started unraveling. A week later, she had spring break. I told her that if she couldn’t plan a trip with her friends, she should come see me in my hometown. Instead of telling me her plans, she just went ahead and booked a trip to Europe with her friends, and I didn’t even know until right before she left.

It wasn’t the first time she’d broken plans with me. She’d promised to take me on her December 2024 ski trip but took her friends instead, saying we’d go hiking out west that summer. She’d planned to visit me for my birthday in May, coordinating that with my mom, but that fell apart because of “scheduling conflicts.” During her Europe trip, she barely talked to me. She had an eSIM, so she could text and call, but she mostly ignored me, going out until 6 or 7 a.m. every night and then complaining about being tired. It felt like I was the last thing on her mind. Then came the final straw. On her last night in Europe, she let her drunk male friend sleep in the same bed as her. I didn’t accuse her of anything. I just said I wasn’t comfortable with it. She blew up, turned it into an argument, and used not FaceTiming me as punishment before falling asleep mid-conversation. She didn’t cheat, but that moment showed how little she respected my feelings.

The next morning, she texted me like nothing had happened, a casual “hey baby” , as if she could smooth it over by pretending it hadn’t occurred. I told her I was mad for the first time in our relationship and that I didn’t know how she could fix it. We made up, and later that night, after she landed back in the U.S., I thought she’d want to reconnect. Instead, she went out in New York City until 4 a.m. I asked her, “When is this party-girl phase going to end?” because she’d been using it as an excuse for months not to prioritize me. The next day, I had a bad OCD episode, one of the first times it showed up while we were texting. I’d hidden that part of myself pretty well until then, but it came through. Instead of being kind or supportive, she acted like I was crazy. She told me I needed to get back into therapy, since I hadn’t had insurance after finishing grad school (end of December)

Over the next few days, she acted distant and strange. On April 9th, I remember telling my sister, “She isn’t going to dump me, is she?” and she said, “No, she loves you too much.” But that night, when I FaceTimed K, it became the first of several conversations that led to her eventually discarding me. We talked about everything, the Europe trip, the bed incident, my “party-girl” comment, and she suddenly said we had different values because of our religions, even though that had never been an issue before. She said it was “messed up” that I didn’t love all parts of her, that the “party-girl” side was who she was. I apologized and tried to make it right, but my friends later told me I hadn’t said anything wrong. I was crying during that call, asking if we had an expiration date, and she said no. I remember sobbing, saying that if she dumped me she’d regret it, and she said she wasn’t there yet. She mentioned being concerned that my mom was Christian and didn’t know K wasn’t religious. I told her I’d talk to my mom about it, and when my mom said she didn’t care, I told K and she said, “Well, that’s good to know for the future, if we do end up together.” Friday, April 11th, I called her from work wanting to talk about the next time I’d see her. She said she didn’t know if she should come, and that maybe we did have an expiration date, that it would be after her graduation. I broke down crying. We talked for hours over text, and she said she wanted us to stay friends. When I asked if we were still together, she said, “That’s up to you, but based on what you’re saying, it doesn’t sound like you want to stay together,” even though I did. That night we FaceTimed again. I told her she was throwing away everything we’d built, and at one point she said, “I wish you were a jerk so this would be easier.” Then she went on another vacation to Mexico for the weekend and told me we should take some space to think even though she kept texting me the whole time.

For a few days, things were weird but semi-normal, like we were trying to pretend nothing had happened. Then the following weekend, she ended it. I told her I wanted a future with her, that I wanted her family to be my family. She said she couldn’t give me what I wanted, that we were too young to fight for a relationship, that this level of commitment shouldn’t happen until we were married. She even used my own words against me the time I told her, “I’d move mountains for you.” She said, “You would move mountains for me, but I wouldn’t for you.” She tried to get me to do the dumping, saying, “I can’t do it, you have to,” but I told her absolutely not. So she dumped me.

Afterward, she sent me a New York Times article about a couple who got back together after five years, like she was trying to plant some kind of hope. She scheduled a “check-in” for May 11th, saying we should talk then. We didn’t talk instead, her mom reached out to me on her behalf. Her mom called me and repeated the same phrases her daughter had used how this was for the best, how we both needed to grow. I told her, “I just wanted to be a good man for your daughter,” and she said, “You were.”

K and I texted briefly for two days after that. She said we shouldn’t talk 24/7 anymore, that we needed space to heal and grow, that if we matured separately we’d be even better if we ever got back together. She told me I had to believe we’d end up together. She even sent me songs like “Invisible String” by Taylor Swift, “Forever With Me” by Conan Gray, and “You’re Gonna Live Forever in Me” by John Mayer.

After a few days, I reached out saying I wanted to talk sooner than May 11th. She read it within minutes but left me on read for two days, acting like she was too busy. When she finally replied, I told her she wasn’t treating me right that her words about loving and caring for me didn’t match her actions, and that if she truly wanted a future with me, she wouldn’t have gambled with me. She left me on read again. That same night, I had a gut feeling she slept with someone else, and honestly, I think she did maybe with more than one guy within a short time.

A week later, on May 4th, I reached out again maybe because I was heartbroken, maybe because it was supposed to be the weekend I’d see her in person and she left me on read again. Then on May 11th, she finally reached out, acting like it was a coincidence. I told her that if she really cared, she’d call me to make sure I was okay. She said, “Of course I care,” but added, “If this is going to be an angry call, I don’t want to engage, because I thought what I did was the most respectful and caring thing I could have done.” I stopped responding and started no contact that night.

She reached out several times afterward, panicking when she realized I wasn’t bluffing. She texted things like, “I care so much about you, but if this isn’t going to help you, I understand,” and “I wanted to talk like we agreed to.” She tried to keep the power. She sent me a short, surface-level message on my birthday emotionless and distant and a few days later, her mom texted me again saying how much I meant to their family and that I should be proud of who I am.

When I walked at graduation, the day before the ceremony, K saw me in person for the first time since the breakup. She stared me down, and I didn’t look back, but I knew. The next day, she texted me acting like she didn’t know if I was there or not, saying, “If you were, and you want to get coffee, let me know.” I didn’t respond. A few days later, on May 28th, I sent her back all her things neatly packed, even though I didn’t have to. She didn’t get them until late June because she spent three and a half weeks celebrating her graduation by partying across Europe. When she finally got them, she texted, “Thanks for sending my things, I just got them. Let me know if you want yours back. Hope you’re doing okay!!!” That was the last thing I ever heard from her. Everything she said after the breakup was cold, consistent, self-protective, and fake and it confirmed that the person I loved never really existed in the first place.

It’s been six months now. I go to therapy once a week and the gym four times a week, trying to rebuild myself piece by piece. My therapist has helped me see it for what it was, emotionally abusive, manipulative, and one-sided. My friends all say she fumbled me. Maybe they’re right. Maybe she’ll never realize it, and maybe I’ll never get closure. I think I just have a hard time dealing with the fact that it's been since June when she breadcrumbed me and it's been radio silence since. she chose partying, drinking, and hookups over the stable future I wanted to give her and it made me feel destroyed. I'm just afraid that she'll come back someday if she does. I have no idea, but she gave me up for nothing because I was asking for a partner who would just give the bare minimum at least most of the time.

I’m into long drives with loud music, sunsets that make you forget your phone exists, and spontaneous plans that somehow end up being the best nights.

sometimes movements which seem like the TD ones from anti-psychotics. (I did get told i had psychosis on some level by a therapist but i live with my family and theres no way they wouldve known(unless they found my journal or those couple times i said something kinda paranoid or something).)

I was more hyper in the past, worse sleep, but its fine now.

had lots of paranoia about being drugged, sometimes i snapped out of weird other beliefs.

Sometimes my irises are small (mostly after coffee, like basically pinpoint in the shadows small). Its not possible I have a migraine almost every time i drink coffee. (Also... I figured I'm just aroace or something, but maybe not...? I had alot of attraction in the past. Could be hormonal, sure that would actually fit as I used to feel more attraction. now dont. never felt much to begin with). 

and im not sure if its cause im trying to look too close to the mirror to see if theyre constricted or not. I figure it might be the sugar but that makes 0 sense realistically.

Otherwise I prepare my own food aside from large familly meals that are made for the familly or ordered.

I feel off.. Was paranoid about being drugged but now im wondering... genuinely that actually would kinda make sense. Weird movements sometimes, like jerking random muscles alot and just frequently moving them. apparently can happen with depression. my memory is shit sometimes but all that can be depression too.

My family doesn't seem to mind how badly im doing academically out of the blue! or they gave up. its ok.

My mind is weird but also calmer. A little depressed, (started hearing things again.)

I've gotten prescribed a benzo for dental anxiety once, (low dose taken once in a very very long white. Thought it was once a month, apparently it was longer. Sense of time is a mess.

So... i dont have withdrawl symptoms, of anything, now do i nor others i know actually use those substances.

1oga2s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oga2s3/find_a_normal_job_or_divorce_shouted_the/,"Find a normal job, or divorce!"" shouted the unemployed husband, running away to his mother. But she just smiled and said, ""Perhaps it will be better this way...""","October was soggy, wet and windy. The wind tore off the last golden leaves from the trees and chased them around the yard, driving them into the corners and under the cars.

Alina, standing by the window, fastened the zipper of her sports jacket and, looking at this autumn chaos, caught herself thinking that there was exactly the same blizzard inside her. Torn shreds of patience, hard-to-hold remnants of hope and a cold, almost physical feeling of fatigue.

It was half past seven in the morning on the clock. Thirty minutes later, I had to be at my first job - in the medical center, where Alina was on duty as an administrator. The second shift, cleaning the offices, I waited for her in the afternoon.

Two jobs, one mortgage and less and less confidence that there is anyone in this life you can rely on.

He and Denis got a two-room apartment on the seventh floor two years ago. Then everything seemed possible. Denis, energetic, self-confident, worked as a manager in a construction company, talked about prospects, about growth, about ""his business in the future"".

Alina listened, believed and was even proud: here, they say, what a husband she has - purposeful, with ambitions. She herself then worked as an administrator in the clinic and received little, but together it seemed to them that it would be enough for everything. The main thing is that there is love, understanding and a common cause.

But in the spring everything collapsed.

The company where Denis worked went bankrupt. The promised payments were delayed, then canceled altogether. Denis was left without a penny. At first, he held on - sent out resumes, went to interviews. But the further I went, the more my hands went down. ""Crisis"", ""everything is seized"", ""they don't take me because the salaries are ridiculous"" - excuses became familiar, and the days - similar to each other.

Alina took a second job at that time to prevent mortgage delays. Tired, I came home after ten o'clock in the evening and each time I met the same picture: a TV, crumbs on the table, unwashed dishes and Denis stretched out on the couch with a remote control in his hand.

He didn't even pretend to be looking for a job.

- Denis, at least you'll vacuum while I'm away,"" she asked quietly, taking off her shoes with difficulty.

- What's the point? - he waved it off lazily. - We'll do it again tomorrow anyway. Anyway, Alin, I'm not a housekeeper. I'm a man. It's not up to me to drag the vacuum cleaner.

- Then get a job, - she answered causticly. - Maybe you won't have to stay at home.

But these words only caused irritation.

He started screaming, accusing her of ""pressing"" him, ""not supporting"", ""not believing"".

Sometimes Alina caught herself thinking that she was even afraid to start a conversation. It was as if he had turned into a completely different person: irritable, lazy, offended by the whole world.

Autumn brought not only cold, but also final discord. Denis began to sit on the phone for a long time, complaining to his friends that ""his wife is completely a star"", that ""he works as a cleaner and makes a earner out of herself"".

Alina accidentally heard these words when he was talking on speakerphone. Something inside it broke off then. She suddenly realized: there is no respect in this house anymore. Neither to her nor to her work.

On that ill-fated Thursday, she came home closer to eleven. In the office center where she was cleaning, one of the washing machines broke down, I had to wash everything by hand. My back hurt, my fingers were shaking from fatigue, and my head was making noise from lack of sleep.

And here's the picture: there's a slot in the kitchen. Oil on the walls, shell underfoot, sink clogged with dirty dishes, and a frying pan with traces of burnt eggs emits an unpleasant smell.

- Denis! - the voice broke into a scream. - What is this?!

The husband appeared at the door, yawning and scratching the back of his head.

- Why? I ate. You'll clean it up tomorrow, I'm tired.

- Tomorrow? - Alina couldn't believe her ears. - And what prevents you from cleaning up today?

- My head hurts. I've been thinking all day about where to earn extra money. Nervous tension.

The laughter broke out by itself - short, hysterical, almost without air.

- Tension? - she raised her hands, as if not believing that she heard it. - Denis, I work twelve hours to pay for this apartment, and you lie on the couch and call it ""tension""?

- Don't shout! - he barked, instantly flashing. - I'm a man, and you're just a wife! Have you forgotten your seat? A woman should inspire, not cut!

- To inspire? - Alina repeated quietly, feeling the heat running down her cheeks. - For what? For another portion of dumplings and whining?

- You don't pull the family! - he shouted, stomping his foot. - A normal wife would find a way to earn more! And you wash the floors for pennies! You're humiliating me!

Her lips twitched.

Are you humiliating?

Is he an unemployed man who lives on her money, who accuses her of humiliation?

- Find a normal job, - Denis shouted, as if he had shot. - Or a divorce!

The words flew around the kitchen like shards of glass.

It became so quiet for a second that you could hear the water boiling in the kettle. Alina stood looking at her husband, and suddenly realized that she no longer felt anger or resentment. Only emptiness. As if all the emotions came out along with these words.

- Okay, - she said quietly. - Divorce is a divorce.

Denis froze, as if he didn't expect such an answer.

He wanted to scare, not hear the agreement.

- You just... - he started, but didn't finish. He grabbed his jacket sharply, slammed the door loudly and flew out of the apartment.

He was followed only by the knock of his steps on the stairs and the ringing sound of the front door slammed.

It became unusually quiet in the apartment.

No TV, no grumbling, no stomping. Even the air seems to have become lighter.

Alina slowly approached the window, looked down: the wet asphalt reflected the yellow lights. A bus passed somewhere in the distance, and raindrops ran down the glass in long threads.

She turned on the kettle, brewed strong black tea, took out a dry bun from the breadbasket.

I felt something strange - lightness. Not the one that happens with joy, but the one that comes when you finally let go of the weight that you have been carrying for too long.

Denis, of course, went to his mother. To Gala Mikhailovna - a woman who all her life believed that ""a man in the house is a god"", and his wife is obliged to feed, stroke and be silent.

She must have already cooked borscht, poured a stack for her son and comforts: ""My poor boy, she doesn't appreciate you.""

But Alina didn't care about it anymore.

She sat in the kitchen until late at night, remembering how it all began: how Denis gave flowers, how he promised that he would always be there, how he called her ""the sun"".

And how gradually these words turned into ""you're late again"", ""you don't look good"", ""you've become cold"".

No, it didn't get cold. She just stopped basing herself from the man who sucks life out of her.

That night Alina slept surprisingly peacefully. No alarms, no waiting for steps in the corridor, no internal tension.

In the morning, waking up before the alarm clock, she felt - for the first time in many months - lightness.

It was drizzling outside, but even the gray sky didn't seem gloomy.

She cooked herself breakfast - just, without haste. I got dressed, put on light makeup and looked at myself in the mirror.

The eyes are clear. The face is calm. It's as if all the heavy things that have been accumulating for the past few months have left the apartment together with Denis.

At work, colleagues immediately noticed the changes.

- Alina, you're just shining today, - nurse Sveta, who became her close friend, was surprised. - What happened? Did your husband find a job?

Alina grinned, putting the cup on the counter.

- No, Svet. My husband is gone. To mom's. With the threat of divorce.

- Oh, God, - she splashed her hands. - And what are you doing now?

- It's okay, - Alina answered calmly. - You know, I think I feel better.

- Easier? But you have a mortgage, an apartment, expenses...

Alina shrugged her shoulders:

- And I dragged all this alone. So nothing has changed - except that the house is now clean and quiet.

Sveta laughed softly:

- Maybe it's for the best. Sometimes loneliness is calmer than living with someone who prevents you from breathing.

In the evening, returning home under the drizzling rain, Alina stopped at the household appliances store.

The showcase reflected her silhouette. She suddenly realized: here she is, a woman who was accused yesterday of ""inability to pull the family"". He stands straight, his eyes are burning, and inside there is confidence that he will cope. Without him, without suts, without eternal excuses.

That evening, she turned on her favorite music for the first time in a long time, lit a candle and just sat down to read a book.

No anxiety, no guilt.

The phone rang several times - Denis. Then Denis' mother. Then it's him again.

Alina didn't answer.

She just put the phone on silent mode and finished her tea.

Three days later, Denis came to the doorstep. Unshaven, with a tired face, with a bouquet of roses in his hands.

- Alin, I'm a fool, - he started from the threshold. - Forgive me, please. I realized everything. My mom told me I was wrong. Let's start over.

She looked at him carefully, but without the usual excitement. Neither the heart tightened, nor the hands trembled.

- Denis, - she said softly, - I don't hate you. It's just... I don't want to live like this anymore.

He froze.

- Is it because of my mistake? I promise, I'll start looking for a job!

- Not because of a mistake, - she shook her head. - Because I finally realized: I don't have to be strong for two. I'm tired of being both husband and wife at the same time.

He lowered his eyes silently.

He stood, then turned around and left.

This time the door closed softly - without shouting, without anger. Just quietly.

Two months have passed.

Alina transferred to another clinic - they offered a higher rate and a convenient schedule.

In the evenings, she no longer rushed to work part-time, but took care of herself: she went to yoga, read books, met with friends.

At first it was unusual to return to an empty apartment, but over time this feeling of loneliness was replaced by calmness.

Now the silence was not emptiness, but freedom.

Sometimes her mother-in-law called her - with reproaches, with persuasions ""to make peace for the sake of the family"". Alina answered calmly:

- Galina Mikhailovna, family is when two pull together, and not one pulls, and the other sits on top.

And that's where the conversation ended.

In the spring, on the first warm day, she walked along the embankment after work, holding a cup of coffee in her hands. People laughed, couples were walking under the sun, and my chest was so light, as if life was starting anew.

She thought: it's strange how often women tolerate just because they're afraid to be alone.

They are afraid - and they put chains on their hands themselves.

But sometimes, to become happy, you just need not to be afraid to let go of someone who prevents you from breathing.

Elaine drinks kahlua w/ coffee thinking its fancy creamer. A frightened Kramer gets locked in a Spirit Halloween. George & Frank battle kids who TP his house from off brand Halloween candy,"Jerry goes to a Halloween masquerade charity event. They announce everyone's donations by name (with comments on levels of generosity) as they come in. 

Jerry donates several thousand dollars, but as he does it the mayor walks in and has his presence announced. Jerry's date thinks Jerry's cheap. He tries to prove he made a donation and convince the announcer to re-announce his donation.

At work, Elaine typically hates Halloween. The costumes annoy her and she hates the work parties. The worst part is the company is run &owned by a Baptist so they don't ever allow alcohol, even at work parties. She usually refuses to wear costumes then gets told she's not a team player. She regularly joked that she'd be on board with a little booze in her system.

This day she's at Jerry's before work and makes coffee there. She looks for creamer and finds a bottle of kahlua. She just reads ""coffee"" and ""-er""(from liqueur) and thinks it's creamer. She tries it and loves it and asks if she can take it. Jerry isn't paying attention and waves for her to take it. Kramer simply comments ""Stick it to the man, soul sister"" as she leaves.

She's very tired so has lots of coffee with creamer during the morning. suddenly Halloween seems fun and the costumes are funny. She even makes a makeshift costume from her work outfit. It's all fine and dandy til she's accused of being drunk at a presentation in the board room....

Kramer meanwhile is asked to buy an extra piece for Jerry's costume for his masquerade charity event. He goes to Spirit Halloween with Newman to pick up some fake blood and vampire teeth, and for Newman to hit on the cute cashier he has a crush on. 

As they pass the motion-detector skeletons and the machines jump and yell, Kramer gets progressively more terrified and tells a story of a harrowing haunted house experience as a child. He panicked, ran, bumped his head, knocked himself out and peed his pants. He had to move schools because the kids at school called him Scooby Doo.

They try makeup and various face paints and fake blood on each other to sample, and lose track of time. In the background the store announces a recall of certain face paints due to hallucinogenic paint.

As they lose track of time, and the cashier was actively avoiding Newman, she closes up and the two  end up being unnoticed and locked inside.

They realize there is an emergency exit through the back of the warehouse but they have to go all the way through the store, and all the spooky creature machines are turned on. They have to walk through an enclosed Haunted Castle that takes up the entire aisle leading to the employee/warehouse door.

George goes to see his parents for Halloween due to everyone else having stuff to do, and his family have a tradition of watching *Twilight Zone* marathon til midnight. 

He eats from their candy supply. George notices half their candy is name brand (100 grand, snickers, kit kat, Mike n Ikes, etc) and half of it is knockoffs. There is a significant drop in quality. Frank comments that he's feeding the entire neighborhood and they're lucky to be getting anything (""when I asked for candy as a child, you know what I got? An onion and a lighter"") while Estelle splurged to get *some* brand name candy.
George picks through and only eats the name brand candy while watching the marathon. 

The doorbell rings and trick or treaters are visibly disappointed in the quality of candy. Then some teens see the ""good candy"" wrappers all around the armchair. They question George and he dismisses them. 

Later in the night they hear giggling and suspicious sounds. He and Frank investigate as Estelle shrieks and they realize they've been TPed by the kids. 

George and Frank determine to seek revenge by getting in the car, finding the kids, and stealing their candy for being selfish and ungrateful.

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1761447548.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

1og9vts,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1og9vts/advice_what_finally_made_me_productive_in_a/,[Advice] What finally made me productive in a chaotic life: 7 brutal truths you won’t hear on TikTok,"Let’s be real. Everyone says “just build a routine” or “manifest success” like they’re life cheats. But what if your life *can’t* be structured? You wake up not knowing what’ll hit you. Maybe it's a last-minute shift, a family thing, burnout, or just your own brain hitting snooze on reality. Most productivity hacks assume your life is a blank canvas. But for a lot of us, it’s more like a Jackson Pollock painting: loud, messy, unpredictable.

This post is for folks like that. I pulled together insights from *actually* helpful books, research-backed advice, and long-form podcasts. Because most of the stuff I see online, especially on TikTok or IG, is from influencers who’ve clearly never had to multitask survival and self-growth. This isn’t about blaming yourself for being “lazy.” It's about building productivity systems that bend with your chaos, not break under it.

Here’s what actually helped:

1. **Work with your energy, not against it**
Instead of fighting randomness, use it. Dr. Andrew Huberman (neuroscientist at Stanford) talks about “ultradian cycles” on Huberman Lab Podcast. Your alertness naturally rises and falls every 90 to 120 minutes. You don’t need a 9-to-5 mindset to be productive. You need a 90-minute mindset. When you feel sharp, do hard tasks. When your brain’s mush, switch to low-effort stuff. Your energy > your schedule.

2. **Redefine what “productive” even means**
A lot of burnout comes from chasing fake productivity metrics. Cal Newport, in *Deep Work*, explains that real productivity means focusing deeply on a few key things, not checking off 30 low-impact tasks. Ask: “What’s the ONE thing today that, if done, makes everything else easier?” That’s your real job today. Don’t confuse motion with progress.

3. **Use “micro-planning” instead of rigid routines**
If your days are unpredictable, don’t plan your life like a military schedule. Try time “blocking” in four-hour chunks. Mornings: focus work. Afternoons: admin or calls. Evenings: recharge. Then adjust within those blocks. The podcast *The Daily Stoic* talks about preparing for chaos by expecting it. Micro-planning helps you adapt without feeling like you failed.

4. **Use tech that adapts to your brain**
The right tools can seriously change the game. Two I found insanely helpful:

  - **BeFreed**: Wildly underrated AI learning app built by a team from Columbia. It takes expert books, lectures, and real success stories, then turns them into personalized audio lessons based on your goals. You can pick how deep you want to go—10, 20, or 40 mins—and even choose your host’s voice (mine sounds like a chill older sibling). It learns from what you listen to and builds an adaptive learning path that updates as you grow. It’s helped me stay mentally sharp even when I’m physically drained. Also, it has a huge library of all the books and podcasts I’m about to recommend below.

  - **Structured**: An underrated daily planner app that lets you drag and drop tasks like Tetris. It’s perfect if your day keeps changing. Visual and satisfying.

5. **This book will make you rethink your entire relationship with time**
*Four Thousand Weeks* by Oliver Burkeman. New York Times bestseller. Burkeman, a long-time productivity skeptic, writes like your smartest friend who’s also deeply existential. The title refers to how long the average human life is. The book doesn’t give hacks. It gives perspective. And ironically, that makes it one of the most practical productivity books ever. It made me stop chasing “the perfect life schedule” and start designing a life that works *with* time, not against it. Best reality-check book I’ve ever read.

6. **Not all motivation has to come from inside you**
One of the best things I learned from behavioral scientist BJ Fogg (author of *Tiny Habits*) is that environment beats willpower. Want to read more? Leave your book on the pillow. Want to journal? Keep it by the coffee maker. Want to stop doomscrolling? Log out. Motivation is overrated. Design wins.

7. **Start your day with dopamine, not dread**
Mel Robbins (from *The Mel Robbins Podcast*) talks a lot about starting your day with momentum. Not scrolling or stress. Try this: before touching your phone, complete one micro-win. Make your bed, drink water, breathe outside. Your brain registers the “win” and releases dopamine, which makes the next task easier. Momentum is chemical. Stack your wins.

8. **This YouTube series is like therapy for chaotic brains**
Ali Abdaal’s *Productivity for the Rest of Us* playlist. He’s a doctor turned creator who doesn’t scream “wake up at 5 AM” at you. He breaks down systems like PARA, Time Blocking, and Energy Mapping in ways that actually feel doable. Also shares his own struggles with burnout. It’s honest and practical.

9. **Get out of your head and into your body**
If you’re stuck in brain fog, don’t try to think your way out. Move. A 2022 meta-analysis in the *Journal of Affective Disorders* showed that just 10 minutes of light movement can significantly improve cognitive focus and mood. Doesn’t have to be a workout. Walk. Stretch. Dance. Shake off the mental clutter.

10. **Go analog once a week**
Digital life = infinite options = decision fatigue. Try a weekly “analog day” or even a half-day. No screens. Just pen, paper, and real-life stuff. The book *Digital Minimalism* by Cal Newport makes a strong case about how our tools are controlling us more than we control them. This reset helps you think clearer and prioritize better.

You don’t need to control your day. You need tools that let you adjust to it. And a mindset that stops punishing you for not being a machine. Start with one of these shifts. See what sticks. Chaos doesn’t have to kill your productivity. It just needs a better game plan.",3,1761447307.0,CuriousAF,1,1.0,False
1og9vk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Informal_Effect/comments/1og9vk5/ha_gayy_numero_quattro/,HA! Gayy numero quattro,"I gave it ten minutes before I went inside, my heart doing a nervous staccato against my ribs. I needed to give him space. I needed to give myself space. I walked in and was immediately hit by the scent of him, that familiar mix of motor oil, pine soap, and Silas.
The apartment was too small. He was a commanding presence even when he wasn't in the room. His discarded flannel was slung over the back of the armchair, the one he’d bled on. His boots were by the door, caked in grime. The copy of Swann's Way was still on the coffee table. The paradox of him was everywhere.
I heard the shower running in the bathroom. A steady, rushing sound.
My phone buzzed in my pocket, and I nearly jumped out of my skin. I pulled it out.
Ben: Oh, okay. No problem. Thanks for letting me know!
I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. It was done. That door was closed. I had closed it, firmly, with Silas as my witness.
And now I was in a small apartment with the man I’d just chosen, and I had no idea what the new rules were.
I went into the kitchen. The pasta from last night was still in a pot on the stove. It was something to do. I could heat up the pasta. That was a normal, roommate thing to do. I turned on the burner, the click click click of the gas ignition sounding offensively loud.
I was stirring cold spaghetti when the water in the bathroom shut off.
My entire body went rigid. The silence that fell was heavy. Expectant. I just kept stirring, my back to the bathroom door, listening. I heard the door creak open. I heard bare feet on the hardwood floor.
I didn't turn around. I couldn't.
""Smells good,"" his voice rumbled, closer than I expected.
I flinched, turning. He was standing at the edge of the kitchen, not three feet away.
And it was... a lot.
He was fresh from the shower, steam still rising from his skin. His hair was dark and damp, curling around his ears. He was wearing an old, faded pair of gray sweatpants that hung low on his hips, and nothing else.
I'd seen him shirtless before, we'd gone swimming in the quarry last summer, but this was different. This wasn't public. This was domestic. This was our home, at night, after... after everything.
His chest was broad, dusted with hair. I could see the faint, silvery lines of old scars I'd never noticed. He was scrubbing his hair dry with a towel, his arms flexing. He was all lean muscle and warm skin.
I swallowed, hard, and turned back to the pasta. ""It's, uh. Just leftovers.""
""My favorite kind.""
He walked past me, and I had to lean forward over the stove to avoid brushing against him. He was so warm. He went to the fridge and pulled out a beer. He leaned against the counter opposite me, popped the top, and just... watched me.
There it was. That look. The What? look, but it was loaded now. It was heavy with the unsaid things from the truck.
My hand was shaking as I stirred. ""So,"" I said, my voice strained. ""The truck sounds good. No... no shing shing shing.""
""Nope."" He took a long drink, his eyes never leaving me.
This was torture. He wasn't going to help me. He had said his piece, and now he was waiting for me to say mine. He was a witch, and he was, in his own assbackwards way, a sweetheart. But he was not... easy.
""Silas,"" I said, turning off the stove. I gripped the wooden spoon. ""About what you said. In the truck.""
He just raised an eyebrow. ""What about it?""
""What... what did you mean?"" I asked, my voice barely a whisper. I was looking at the pot, at the red sauce, at anything but him.
""What'd you think I meant, Asa?""
I squeezed my eyes shut. Of course. He was going to make me say it. He was going to make me be the ""bad liar"" and force me to tell the truth. I could feel him reading me, peeling back the layers of my cowardice.
""I... I think..."" I started. I was going to do it. I was going to say it. I think you know I love you. I think you...
The world exploded.
Or rather, the front door did. It slammed open, and a whirlwind of perfume, scarves, and chaotic energy blew into the apartment.
""Hiiiiii! I come bearing wine and a deep seated need for gossip!""
Chloe.
She bustled in, kicking the door shut with her heel, her arms full of a tote bag and two bottles of cheap rosé.
""I figured we could order pizza, my treat. Asa, you have to tell me everything about Ben, and Si... oh.""
She stopped dead. She took in the scene. Me, frozen at the stove, gripping a spoon like a weapon. Silas, leaning against the counter, half naked, holding a beer, his expression unreadable. The air in the apartment was so thick you could have cut it with a knife.
""Ooh,"" Chloe said, her voice dropping. ""Sorry. Did I... interrupt... whatever this is?""
I watched Silas. I watched the man I was about to confess something to. He didn't move for a second. Then, it was like watching a curtain fall. His shoulders, which had been relaxed, tensed. The look in his eyes, which had been sharp and focused on me, went flat and distant. He was gone. He’d retreated behind the wall.
""It's nothin',"" he muttered. He pushed off the counter, grabbed his flannel from the armchair, and slung it over his shoulders, not even bothering with the armholes. He was covering himself. ""I'm... gonna read.""
He grabbed his book, sat in his chair, and disappeared. Just like that. The man who had been a live wire of tension was now just a guy in a chair with a book.
I felt a surge of... I didn't know what. Relief? Fury? Despair?
""Okay... what was that?"" Chloe whispered, moving into the kitchen, her eyes wide. ""He's in a mood.""
""He's always in a mood, Chlo,"" I sighed, turning back to the stove, my shoulders slumping. The moment was gone. It had shattered.
""No, that was a mood. Anyway! Pizza! But first,"" she set the wine on the counter, ""tell me! Ben. He texted you, right? I told him you were quiet but, like, deep.""
I stared at the pasta. I thought about the text. I thought about Silas, sitting in that chair, pretending to read, but I knew, I knew he was listening to every word.
""Asa? Did you text him back? He's so great, isn't he? I think you two would be—""
""Chloe, stop.""
The words were quiet, but they cut through her chatter. She froze. ""What?""
""Just... stop."" I turned around, and I must have looked as exhausted and heartsick as I felt. ""I don't want to talk about Ben. I'm not going to date Ben.""
Chloe's face crumpled. ""But... why? You haven't even met him! Asa, you're not even trying.""
""Yes, I am!"" I snapped, and my voice was louder than I intended. ""That's the problem, Chloe. I am trying. I'm trying really hard. And I don't want him. Okay? I'm not... he's not what I want.""
""Then what do you want, Asa?"" she cried, her voice full of genuine, confused frustration. ""Because you're just... here. You're just here with... with him,"" she gestured toward the living room, ""and you're not living.""
""Maybe this is living,"" I said, my voice low. ""Maybe you don't get to decide what my life is.""
Chloe looked stunned, like I'd slapped her. The silence in the apartment was absolute. There was no sound of a page turning from the living room.
I was breathing hard. I’d never talked to her like that. I looked past her, toward the armchair.
Silas wasn't reading. His book was closed, resting on his lap. He was just watching me, his face half hidden in the shadows of the lamp. His expression was intense. And as I held his gaze, he gave me the smallest, almost imperceptible nod.
It was a nod of approval. A nod that said, Good.
A nod that said, Finally.
I looked from Chloe's hurt, confused face to Silas's dark, expectant one. I had closed one door. I had just cracked another. And now, I was trapped between my two best friends, in a room that was suddenly way, way too small.",1,1761447284.0,Informal_Effect,0,1.0,False

he is constantly tired. If he sits on the couch he will nap. If we watch tv he falls asleep. He can fall asleep at any time during the day if hes stationary. He will push through the day like normal but hes tired the whole time and yawning, even after coffee.

I was 5 weeks 5 days pregnant on the date of my medical abortion (yesterday, Friday). I’m a 38 year-old woman with no children, one husband, and some cats. I paid $345 for the pills and shipping. I live in a state with excellent healthcare access, and I chose MA because I didn’t want to wait longer for a surgical procedure. I just wanted this miserable pregnancy to be over.

Meds timeline:
4 mg of zofran around 9 am
4 mg of zofran at 12:40
Mife at 1:20
800 mg ibuprofen at 1:50
Miso vaginally at 2:10
4 mg of zofran at 5:00
800 mg ibuprofen at midnight

First noticeable cramp around 2:30. Potential chills at the same time but I was chilly before so I don’t know if that’s really a symptom. Wanting to poop feelings sort of starting as well. Overall feeling pretty calm. 

3:00 chills, hungry. Went to the bathroom to check, nothing going on yet. Walking around my house to warm up and try to get things going

3:15 chills coming and going, taking a walk around my house. Little tiny pinches of cramps here and there. Assuming things will start picking up in an hour or so.

3:30 cramps steady 1-2/10. Really light, but noticeable. Feel like period cramps. No other symptoms yet.

4:30 finally starting to bleed. Passed a quarter-sized clot immediately. Cramps still minimal. Chills still continuing off and on. Perhaps slight waves of nausea here and there but that honestly could just be from being hungry. 

5:00 cramps staying steady at 1-2/10. Passed another quarter-sized clot, with some blood. Chills starting to lessen. Took 4 mg of zofran just in case. Everything is really chill and calm so far. 

6:30 cramps ramping up, probably 5-6/10. I wonder how bad they would be if I hadnt taken ibuprofen. Hoping the cramps ramping means this will be over soon.

7:15 passed a large clot about the size of a lime, and I think it was the pregnancy. I feel relieved physically. 

8:00 bleeding ramping up a little bit, cramps seem to be ebbing. Passed a couple more large clots without major cramping. Cramps sitting around 3-4/10. Still have some chills but they’re lessening. 

9:00 cramping back up to 5-6/10, steady bleeding, clots, and cramps. Like day one of a bad period. Nausea is all gone, chills gone. I don’t think I feel pregnant anymore. 

9:15 took another 4 mg of zofran. I don’t feel and haven’t felt nauseated in awhile, but don’t want to risk it. Cramps are 6-7/10 and coming in small waves. Bleeding seems like it may be chilling out a little bit, clots are chilling out too.

11:15 cramps have gone back down to 3-4/10. Bleeding is steady and about as heavy as day one of my period, haven’t had any clots in awhile. Tired. Hungry. 

Midnight took 800 mg of ibuprofen. Ate some snacks, drank some water. Feeling back to normal. Watched a movie and went to bed. 

9 am next morning woke up with overnight pad about 3/4 full. No cramps. Feeling normal again, pregnancy symptoms gone (minus sore boobs). Went to work. My appetite today is still a little off, but I’ve been able to drink coffee and eat normal food again.

Overall the biggest symptom I had, other than bleeding/passing clots & cramps, was having chills. My day sucked because having an abortion sucks, but it wasn’t nearly as bad or dramatic as I thought it would be. The pain was never severe, I didn’t have diarrhea, I didn’t feel faint, I never even came close to being sick. I was honestly mostly just bored and wanted it to be over so I could get back to regular life again.

That said, I am having a very hard time trying to ID this machine. My in-laws have had it for years from a long closed coffee shop and think it's a Gaggia, which is what extensive internet searches have suggested. But as for the model or even a confirmation of if it actually is a Gaggia... I'm at a loss.

Does anyone here have any insights? I understand that Gaggia is mainly lever operated and there aren't any levers this one, so I think thats why I'm coming up short on my searches for it. The closest I've come is finding out that a few models have been bought by distributors and have been modified, but thats about all I can find.

I recently turned 35 and its hard to meet people and maintain friendships when life gets busy. Im looking to meet people and maybe make a new friend.  We can trade TikToks, new song discoveries, laugh at the impending doom of the incontinental divider, plan gaming sessions or even the mundane of our daily lives.  I’m a pretty big nerd with a wide range of hobbies, so there’s a good chance we’ll click over something. Here's a bit about me:

🍳 Food lover – I enjoy cooking and trying new dishes. Let’s trade recipe recs

🎮 Gamer – currently hooked on Marvel Rivals. Recent favorites include BG3, OW2, and Fortnite.

📚 Reader – Mostly sci-fi and fantasy. Currently deep into Dungeon Crawler Carl. Let's talk about our favorite books we read this year.  

🎧 Music - I'm no music buff but I do enjoy going to the occasional show.  I generally enjoy different types of rock ( metalcore, alternative,  psychedelic) and funky electronic music.  I recently saw Sleep Token live and it was amazing.   

🌲 Outdoors stuff – I love hiking with our two huskies, foraging, and just started learning pickleball (I’m still terrible, but it’s fun).

🍻☕ Brews – I’m a craft beer and coffee snob

🐕Pets- I love animals but dogs are my favorite. my partner and I have 2 fur babies. If you have pets please share 

👬 I’m a gay man in a relationship—just looking for an online friend to talk about life, share recipes, tik toks and potentially game. In the chance someone local (WI)  reaches out, maybe we could grab a drink.

there’s this new girl who joined about two months ago she’s super easy to talk to funny always nice to me we started texting a bit outside of work and i started to think maybe she liked me too i know that’s dangerous thinking but she was always friendly and kept the conversation going so i convinced myself there was a spark

last night i saw on the bump app that she was at a restaurant not far from my place my brain short circuited and thought hey maybe i could just walk by and say hi maybe grab a quick bite if she’s alone it sounded harmless in my head so i did it i went there walked inside looked around and saw her sitting across from a guy they were laughing sharing food and clearly on a date i froze like a deer in headlights and then did a full 180 out the door

the worst part is she saw me i know she saw me our eyes met for half a second and i could literally feel my soul leave my body i spent the rest of the night pretending it didn’t happen but i barely slept this morning i opened the bump app and she’s gone maybe she turned on ghost mode maybe she just doesn’t want me to see her location anymore either way i deserved that

it’s totally my fault i read too much into friendly energy and then acted on impulse instead of common sense i’ve been cringing at myself all day and i don’t think i’ll ever look at that app again without feeling secondhand embarrassment from my own stupidity

**TLDR** saw my coworker’s location on the bump app thought she liked me decided to stop by the restaurant she was at found her on a date she saw me and now she’s probably on ghost mode while i’m dying of shame",152,1761446104.0,tifu,49,0.87,False

We met at a card shop and enter tournaments a lot arround the city. The thing is, he really likes taking handouts. He’s always talking about how broke he is (which I don’t doubt) and I’ve leant him a lot of expensive cards (about 300$ CAD worth) and he keeps asking for more stuff. 

Every time we go to get coffee has asks if I’ll pay for his coffee (and I have at least 3 times). He said he would pay me back later for the cards, specifying late November but he gets all stressed/angry when ever I bring up HIS money. I once brought up how he has a 650$ deck (he likes to use the most expensive version of every card) and how he could just sell a few from that to make some cash and he just says “this conversation is really pissing me off”

He’s even gone out of the way to sell the very cards I gave him, come back to me and say that he sold it for like 50$ above what I paid, which is fine, I said they were his now, but THEN when I respond with “so are you gonna pay me back early then?” He’s says “bro, you said I could pay you back in November wtf!?” 

Recently I had a talk with him when he asked for more cards to borrow and I said “I can’t keep giving you stuff to hold onto, it’s not fair to put you in that position of debt and obligation to me” because I don’t wanna make him mad when he still owes me. But I don’t know what to say next time he asks me for 10$ to enter a tournament or buy a coffee or use the subway. 

Last thing I’ll say is that he will still give me amazing deals for cards because I’m his friend. He’s offered me 50$ cards for 20$, I did not ask for them, I’ve even said no thanks, and that he could probably get more money from selling to someone else, but he’s like “pleeeease” I think because he wants it fast. He’s not on drugs I don’t think. 

Anyways, what am I to do at this point? i like hanging out with him when he’s not asking for stuff but this is a bit of a new area of life for me. I’ve never met someone who is just constantly pushing for more.",0,1761445943.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

1og9bnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1og9bnw/made_a_simple_tool_to_rank_anything_and_compare/,Made a simple tool to rank anything and compare with a friend. Looking for feedback.,"**Background**

I found it useful to compare the core rankings of life values of myself and someone else (e.g., Core Values like Family, Career, Friends; you can add anything else, like Independence or anything important to you). It was useful because it generated deeper conversation between me and them when we saw our rankings and talked about the differences. ""Why did you add X? Why put this above that?"" This then led to the simple inspiration that every person has an inner ranking that drives everything they do, and it would be fascinating to uncover that and share between people to build empathy.

(I also thought this would be a quick way to learn some of the latest basic full-stack and deployment technologies + test out the latest ai coding tools.)

**The Product**

This simple tool lets you compare rankings of not just Core Values (like one of the options; the original inspiration), but various other categories, like Cuisines, Coffee Drinks, Movie Genres. You can write your own topic and add your own items, too.

[**https://value-ranker.vercel.app/rankings/new**](https://value-ranker.vercel.app/rankings/new)

**I'm looking for feedback on product usefulness and any creative ideas for useful AI-integrations**... (I hope this is an appropriate place for this). Based on feedback, I might take this project further, but I also think a valuable step in building projects is recognizing when it is appropriate to stop and just be happy with the simple use case you solve.

I believe it doesn't solve a major need, but found it a fun project to build and share and hope for helpful feedback.

**Learnings so far**  
It's good to find some initial inspiration, but then distill it to a practical very contained use case, like above. Ask for feedback continuously and early (as I am doing) to gauge if a project should continue.",1,1761445521.0,buildinpublic,0,1.0,False

1og9b47,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1og9b47/why_habit_stacking_is_the_cheat_code_no_one/,Why habit stacking is the cheat code no one taught us: a brutally practical guide that works,"A lot of people I know are quietly overwhelmed by how hard it is to build new habits. We’re told to ""just be more disciplined"" or ""get up earlier"" or ""manifest your dream life"", like that’s supposed to fix the wired chaos of modern life. Worse, there’s a whole ecosystem of influencers pushing aesthetics over real psychology. Like, no, buying a beige water bottle won’t fix your lack of discipline. The truth? Most people don’t fail because they’re lazy. They fail because they’re trying to build new routines from scratch, with no anchors, no scaffolding, no systems. That’s where something like habit stacking becomes an actual game-changer.

This post is a fully researched dive into what actually works. Backed by the best books, psychology research, YouTube explainers, and real-world case studies. No fluff, no vague motivational quotes. Just the stuff that makes habits stick.

The idea of **habit stacking** came into mainstream self-development thanks to James Clear’s *Atomic Habits*, a global bestseller with over 15 million copies sold. Clear breaks down behavioral change into visuals so digestible it feels like cheating. His core insight? You don’t build a habit in a vacuum. You attach it to something you already do. This is called “cue-based behavior design.”

For example, if you already make coffee every morning, stack a new habit on top: do ten pushups while the kettle boils. Or do one page of daily journaling right after brushing your teeth. It's stupid simple, which is why it works.

This approach aligns closely with what Stanford professor BJ Fogg calls “anchor habits” in his book *Tiny Habits*. Fogg, who runs the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford, found that people are more consistent when they tie small actions to already-established routines, like tying flossing to brushing, or gratitude practice to opening your laptop. He calls it “floss one tooth” level small. Because consistency always beats intensity.

And it’s not just theory. A 2021 meta-review in the journal *Health Psychology Review* found that implementation intentions (basically, “if X, then Y” plans) dramatically increase the odds of successfully forming a new habit. Especially when tied to a trigger that already lives in your routine. In other words, stacking isn’t a hack. It’s grounded in behavioral science.

But here’s the piece most people miss: stacking only works when the new habit is frictionless and emotionally rewarding. This means you need to fine-tune your stack. If you hate journaling, don’t force that after teeth-brushing. Pick something you’re at least neutral about. Or gamify it. You also don’t need to start with “productive” habits. Stacking just one minute of deep breathing after opening your fridge can become a gateway to meditation. Weirdly effective.

Want to build social habits? Stack texting a friend with your lunch break. Want to remember to drink more water? Stack it with bathroom breaks. It’s not about creating time. It’s about stealing it back intelligently.

One underrated YouTube channel that goes deep on this is **Matt D'Avella**. His minimalist aesthetic is chill, but he backs it with experiments and meta-habit research. If you're visual, his video ""How to Build Better Habits Without Motivation"" is gold. It breaks down why motivation is unreliable, and why context-driven habits win out long-term. Highly recommend bingeing that.

There’s also a podcast episode from **The Psychology Podcast** with Dr. Wendy Wood (USC professor and author of *Good Habits, Bad Habits*). She points out that 43% of what we do every day is out of habit, not conscious decision. So the goal isn’t to grind harder. It’s to hijack that autopilot.

For books, you absolutely cannot miss **Atomic Habits by James Clear**. It’s the #1 most recommended book in productivity circles for a reason. Every chapter blows your mind with ""Why didn't anyone tell me this before?"" moments. It’s packed with frameworks like the 4 laws of behavior change, habit stacking strategies, identity change systems and more. The visuals alone are genius. This book will make you question everything you think you know about willpower. Easily the most practical guide to long-term habit formation that’s ever been written.

Another one that hits deep is **The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg**, a Pulitzer-winning investigative journalist. This book gives you the science behind how our brains build loops from cue to routine to reward. It’s a bit more narrative than Atomic Habits, but that makes you remember the stories longer. After this book you’ll start seeing habit loops everywhere, your phone addiction, your snacking habits, your procrastination spirals. It messes with your head in the best way.

If you're into apps, **Finch** is a great one. It's disguised like a self-care pet game, but underneath it’s a really clever behavioral system for building positive habits. You name your little pet, set intentions, and get rewards for real-world wellness goals. It’s built on positive reinforcement, which makes it oddly addictive in a healthy way.

For something more structured and research-backed, **BeFreed** is a total sleeper hit. It’s an AI-powered learning app that turns books, expert podcasts, and real-life success stories into bite-sized learning paths tailored to your goals. The cool part? You pick how deep you want to go, 10, 20, or 40 minute episodes, and choose the host voice you vibe with. It even tracks what you’re drawn to over time and adapts your roadmap as you evolve. It’s like having a personal coach who’s also a podcast nerd. It’s built by cognitive scientists from Columbia. And yes, it covers all the books I just mentioned, Atomic Habits, Power of Habit, and more. Plus it makes it ridiculously easy to translate ideas like habit stacking into your real life.

Stack smart. Keep it small. Pair it with fun.

I’m doing all of that. May start ivabradine for high pulse. But the doctor also suggested fludrocortisone- as it’s a steroid I’m concerned about weight gain. I don’t always gain weight on meds but when I do it’s 40,50, 60 pounds so not just a small amount. 

She also suggested low dose naltrexone to reduce over all system inflammation. 

Has anyone had experience with fludrocortisone and naltrexone? Have they helped? Specifically fludrocortisone without weight gain?

For reference I went from 120lb then did the depo shot for 6 months and gained 60 pounds. I couldn’t get the weight down after stopping even with drinking only black coffee, water and eating salads for dinner and running. Eventually tried Wellbutrin for depression that helped me lose weight. Had insurance issues then when I went back to the doctor she put me on Zoloft and gained 40 pounds. Again hard to get weight down without other meds. ",1,1761445160.0,POTS,2,0.99,False
