I started drinking coffee in my teens. Over the past decade as a working adult, it has been a daily habit for me to have one coffee in the morning, and one coffee after lunch which I would sip slowly over the afternoon in my office cubicle. In a way, my coffee drinks are my emotional/mental crutch which I rely on to feel that I would be okay and have enough energy for the day.

After coming across this subreddit, I happened to take a few days off work, and stopped my afternoon coffee because I had time for naps, and didn't need the boost to get me through the afternoon. I decided to ride on this by continuing to cut my afternoon coffee.

It's been a week so far, and I am not sure if it's my imagination but I feel less tense in my head/neck area, and a bit more relaxed. I fall asleep much more easily too. Usually I sleep all the way until my alarm clock wakes me up, but I now wake up naturally at about 5-6am (although I continue to laze in bed). 

At work, I have now switched my drink to a non-caffeinated tea which I slowly sip as my emotional crutch drink. 

I am going to slowly taper down the amount of coffee I have in the morning and eventually to zero.

1hvh8vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breakupadvice/comments/1hvh8vp/after_half_a_year_dating_and_6_years_of_knowing/,"After half a year dating and 6 years of knowing each other, she blocked me everywhere on social media. Was my decision afterwards the right one? ","We knew each other since 2018, but got in contact during November 2023 after she had just ended a relationship with her ex boyfriend. (The guy left her out of nowhere after going to college, and had intimate relations with her which led to unfortunate events for her at the time) We then kind of did or had this online flirting with each other in the following months. She said she needed time to forget about him and so we waited (She wanted to graduate, leave the past behind and be “all mine”) until around June of 2024 during her high school graduation we became official. We had our own intimacy through pictures, our own movie/tv show nights on calls. I even made a Snapchat account since she asked me to make one. Around September 2024 after she went with her family on a trip (She and her mom would get tattoos) She began acting weird, she no longer wanted “Intimacy”, she didn’t seemed as interested in texting me as before. (Usually we would chat on discord/snapchat and she would always send me pictures of her trips, where she was at and what she was doing, she also spoke to her friends about me and heard their voices on a call while she was video gaming with them.) Regardless, she still wanted us to cosplay some characters from an animated movie she liked, wished me happy international boyfriend day and one week before finally ignoring me told me to watch Wicked on a pirated site with her. The last conversation before we watched wicked was that with her cosmetology classes she wouldn’t have time at all. She also said she “hated” how upset I was whenever she wasn’t around and didn’t wanted to hurt me anymore. I told her I would be totally fine waiting all the time I needed to wait, that I wanted her to chase the dreams she had and I would always be there to support it but also told her to at least text me one day per week, to let me know she was okay. (I also would like to remark after getting desperate as she would go on half a week without even telling me she was busy, once texting back there was this time in which she would say out of nowhere that “She felt I was hiding stuff from her sometimes” when I urged her and asked what exactly where those
things she thought I was supposedly hiding from her she didn’t gave me a precise answer. They were out of the blue too.) What true boyfriend/girlfriend wouldn’t want their partner to be alright, right? At first I thought it was due to her parents being strict but after I told my mom she said she was most likely either back with her ex and in contact with him, or had found a replacement for me since September 2024 which was when everything started. I didn’t try to get her back so far, as my mom told me her blocking me everywhere (Instagram, Snapchat, discord) was a way of saying she didn’t wanted me in her life anymore, but that it wasn’t my fault at all, that it was okay to cry but that she didn’t wanted me to cry for someone that couldn’t care less about me. She’s a great mother but I just can’t, I should listen to my mom but all the daily Snapchats messages where she called me baby, telling me her daily activities like going to her close by cafe, a place called “Farmer’s market” where she got her coffee and hanged out with her friend group from high school, I miss it all. Did she cheated on me? the only way I could get an answer would be asking her but I never did, I was afraid to come off as insecure and never had any negative feelings towards my relationship nor her to think such a thing. Could it be that maybe it was because she knew my previous partner also broke me emotionally (I told her about it and they both kind of knew each other in the past, same online group.) and she was too coward to admit she also disappointed me so preferred to block me? I don’t know and right now I’m doing my best to move on, I don’t hold any grudges nor I hate her at all. For now at least a part of me will always love her, but this month hasn’t been great at all, neither was Christmas nor new years as I wanted us to call during those days like we used to. I’m not telling my story here to whine about it, be an attention seeker or
feel pity. I was interested in hearing any of you guys’ experiences that were similar to mine and maybe have what they call an interesting midnight conversation. I’m working hard every day to move on from it, but we can’t deny a part of us will be in the meantime, devastated because of it. ",1,1736217446.0,Breakupadvice,0,0.99,False

1hvh4c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hvh4c0/the_worstcase_scenario_came_true/,The worst-case scenario came true,"Oh man. I'll preface this by saying the last few weeks has been a tornado. My ex (27M) and I (20F) broke up in mid-October after dating for over 1.5 years and sharing a (mostly) beautiful, caring relationship. It was somewhat of a mutual breakup as things just weren't really working out. Towards the end he had told me that he would to anything to keep a future with me, but things still ended up not really working. I tried to get back together about 2 weeks post-breakup. He denied my attempt, saying we both needed time to process. 

An important thing to note in this situation is the fact that we live together. We're both in college, so we live in a house together in the college town. Luckily, we do NOT share a room. Due to living together we had continued hooking up post break up on a few occassions. Each time after we hooked up he got completely cold-shouldered towards me. However, we were still interacting semi-friendly, he helped my fix my car, so on and so forth. 

Fast forward a bit to mid-December. We had a huge fight after we both returned from a night out downtown, but it ended with up sleeping together and hanging out all day the next day (going to study at a coffee shop, going out to dinner, spending the night together again). The next morning (after spending two nights together) I had to leave on a trip to Mexico with one of my friends. We agreed that it would be important to revisit and have a conversation upon my return. While in Mexico he checked up on me periodically, although kind of backed off towards the end of the trip. When I returned he had completely flipped his demeanor again, back to being somewhat cold. 

Over the holidays I tried to visit my mom, which didn't go very well. So, I ended up spending the holidays with his family and was with him for four days (which was clearly what he wanted at the time and that was verbalized). The entire time I was with him it was extremely relationship-y. I'm talking slow dancing in the kitchen, sleeping in the same bed, random waist grab to kiss on the street kind of stuff. During this time period he told me he loved me. He also randomly brought up one of our other housemates that he had recently gotten close to, saying ""I'm so happy to have a friend like \_\_\_\_. We talked and set boundaries that there is nothing going on there and it feels good to have a female friend like that. I'm not attracted to her at all"", so on and so forth. I half-joked back ""Good, because it would really really hurt me if anything happened between the two of you"".

I ended up going back home earlier than him. When I got back, said housemate was there and she began prying at me about my feelings on the situation and if I think we're going to get back together. I told her how I felt, that I wanted to get back together but wasn't sure honestly about the situation at hand. 

Later that night she mentioned that he was planning to go to Joshua Tree with her for NYE. The next morning they were meant to leave. That morning I felt overwhelmingly sad. As they were about to leave, I left to the backyard to cry because I just couldn't be around them. I presume he heard me crying, because he came running back there to console me. I told him ""I think you don't care about how I feel at all"" to which he replied ""That's not true"".  He then made it clear that he was on a time crunch and had to leave.

He texted me saying he felt bad about that interaction and wished he could say more but couldn't. The next day, he texted me checking up on me and my New Years plans. I didn't respond because I felt it was unnecessary and I was already hurt. I was out having fun with my friends, anyway, and trying not to focus on a guy who was giving me LITERALLY nothing.

When I got back home, both she and him gave me hugs and asked about my trip. They were enthusiastic to share and almost over welcoming. That's when I noticed a hickey on her neck. It was strange, because while I was gone I had envisioned coming home and seeing a hickey on her neck. Now, it was true. An awful feeling began looming over me. I asked her about it, and she responded extremely suspiciously ""Oh, yeah, uh... It was this random guy. Haha, New Years fun, am I right?"". I immediately knew what had happened....

Later in the day, I came up to her and asked her to be just be honest with me. She was very adamant about dodging my inquiry: ""I know you might be uncomfortable with us being close friends but..."" to which I told her that wasn't what I was talking about. She just shot me a look that said 'I'm not giving you anything', so I walked away. A few moments later she came to find me in the backyard and told me she had something to tell me.

Of course I was right, they had slept together. Obviously I know that he is now single and has to autonomy to do whatever he wants, but its really just the premise of everything. He was essentially leading me on FOR MONTHS, alluding to the idea that he wants to get back together but feels like he 'needs to change'. She was pretending to care about my feelings and be my friend the entire time as well. On top of it all of the lies just kill me. If you're going to do something like that, just be honest about it. It's been a whirlwind of emotion and I'm trying to figure out how to exist in this house at the moment. She will be moving out at the beginning of February, it will be harder to get him out unfortunately. I'm currently not speaking with him at all and honestly don't plan to.

I was extremely angry the first few days after finding out (and still am), but now the sadness is coming back in slowly. I feel like I'm mourning the person that I thought he was. I just need to find a way to move forward and forget this whole mess ever affected me in the first place.",1,1736217060.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1hvh2ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hvh2ac/should_i_dm_the_ex/,Should i DM the ex ?,"Hi! This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I need solid advice. My fiance and i have been together for about 4.5 years. We're in the midst of planning a wedding for this summer but in the process we've gotten into some pretty heated arguments. This is going to be long, so, sorry in advance.

  
When my fiance and i first started dating he was on social media, across the board. I noticed immediately he had photos up of what i could only come to the conclusion of being his ex. ( I deleted my FB in 2015 ) so i didn't have any access to FB to see his profile. I moved back into the city we live in now, i was coming from being out of an abusive relationship and moving back home but a lot of people that i use to know either moved out or moved out for covid. ( We live in a big city ) so i didn't have a lot of time or ways to connect with people, plus i WFH full time. After a few months of dating we decided to move in together. This was during covid, his roommate was moving out and i was alone in a city i consider home but often lonely in my own apartment. I was so excited. Until i wasn't. The more i learned about the ex the more i questioned. They dated for 6 years, he told me she use to scream at him for simply 'asking if she's almost ready to go'. When i moved in i noticed he still had those photos up on IG of her. None of me or of us. His facebook was public so my friend was able to see it and sent me a video of it where i could see he had albums on there of her and him. Let me add at this point ( it was 2020 ) and they broke up in 2017 so roughly 3 years?  In the basement there was a box of her things that he moved to the city with even though they had been broken up previously for about a year or so before he moved. There were instax photos of her in his draws that i found one day. Granted they were in a bottom of a drawer but flipped over side by side. He claimed he doesn't even remember those being there and probably forgot to throw them away. The box of stuff in the basement, she simply was suppose to pick up but never did and the movers ended up grabbing the box and thats how it ended up here. OH and the instagram photos he completely forgot to take those down and never looked at his own profile. Now he doesn't use instagram, so thats why theres no photos of me or us. 

  
He has a girl thats a friend who use to work with him in a different location and now works with him currently so they've been friends for years, during the time he was with the ex. I guess sometime over the weekend she was sending him photos of previous coworkers and funny post. She sent him a facebook post he commented on years ago. Initially when i saw the thread this wasn't in there. I decided to snoop and saw there was a deleted message so i recovered it thinking why would he delete this? I go back to the thread and i see this post, but im still questioning why would he delete this? I zoom in, and then i see it. It was a profile photo of him and his ex. Something he's never done for me in 4.5 years. I initially asked why he deleted this and he claimed he didn't delete any messages, but i told him i could see it after i recovered it. He then said because he didn't want to deal with me being upset. 

now i am upset. Im not upset because of this photo though its becoming more obvious to me im a stepping stone but earlier today we got into an argument because about a month or so ago he lied to me about going to get a cup of coffee when we share locations and for some reason i just happened to look at that time and day and saw him going to get coffee so i tried to call and text him to ask if he could get me one as well but when he called me back he told me he didn't go get coffee and that he was working and im insane. He acted irrational all day that day, he blocked me, he wouldn't talk to me he told me he wanted to break up with me. This went on for 2 days, finally on the second day when i wasn't letting up that i was being gaslit he finally said he lied and he did go get coffee but didn't want to deal with me... i guess asking for one too?

This got me thinking if he could act like this so casually over a cup of coffee then what else has he lied to me about this whole time. About a year ago his ex who i mentioned earlier ( the one that had been broken up with him at this point for 7 years ) somehow messaged him on IG. He told me she was blocked and showed me, she was. She messaged a group chat that they had with a friend from 10 years prior and sent over a video of something stupid on the explore page. No i dont think this was an accident. Especially after he told her he does not want to talk to her ( prior to me and him meeting ) and blocked her ( i watched him block her on IG ). Since then i can't shake the feeling that something with that is weird. 

Every time i try to ask about why they broke up he tells me they moved into an apartment together the last year they were together and lived in it for about 3 months and after work one day she just came home and decided to break up with him. I asked if there was a previous fight or something maybe a week, month or few days prior and he always says no. Obviously this makes no sense. Im also starting to believe he lies through his teeth. I want to know why they broke up because i am missing a BIG part of this puzzle and why am i being lied to about it.

today during our argument we had both decided to have lunch and right when i sat down with my food he decided to spit in it and then tell me to go fuck myself and headed back to work. This not only left me feeling disgusted but just overall in awe of the person i thought i knew. He's told me before im probably making up about being in an abusive relationship but then later on apologized and said he was angry when saying that. He's called me a cunt, same apologized. 

I just feel like in this relationship im always getting the short end of the stick. I feel like my partners in competition with me. After he left we exchanged messages a few hours later where he said he was sorry and felt bad but i egged him on...by voicing my concerns???? oh sorry my concern was that he lied to me about who he got coffee with today and instead of being rational and realizing why i feel that way his response was to spit in my food. 

  
I want to know if this is a pattern of behavior and if this is going to get worse. I know i listed 101 reasons why i need to leave but in every day life he doesn't act like this where as my ex did so im not sure if thats why im tolerating this or what. I think i just want answers i want to be sure either way before making either decision.

I have really bad excessive sleeping for 4 years now since I was in college as a freshman till now. I’m 24 years old and I have to sleep so much in the day to function. A nap for me is like 5hrs straight that’s addition to the normal 9hrs I get form night . I always have this problem and when I don’t sleep that much everyday i feel my brain is so heavy and I can’t think straight or do anything functional. I feel like I’m drunk . I never did drugs or drink in my life because I am Muslim . I don’t really know what this problem it and I don’t want to go to doctor because they will give me stimulants and it has long term effect. Also when I drink coffee I get anxiety I haven’t drink coffee for a year now and I don’t want to drink because  that’s what I used to do when I was in undergrad. Does anyone know how to solve this naturally or what’s the cause of this.

I decided to take a risk and plug it in like this and I found that that cylindrical thing on the top left corner behind the circuit, which I believe is a capacitor, heats up within a few seconds. There's another one on the circuit which is a little shorter which doesn't heat up.

I don’t know what church he joined but he always knows what day is Sunday. And he has, without fail, for the last three years. 

Backstory - we (and the second, less schedule shiba Lana) moved back home with family over three years ago.  Pretty quickly we got in a morning routine when we get home from our walk (every morning rain or shine) the Shibas getting a treat from my dad. I pour my coffee, get my breakfast, they get their treat. 

Except for Sundays. Archer does not take a treat on Sundays. They are offered, they are ready, he is nowhere to be found (okay he can be found - usually chilling in the basement near his food bowl). I do not understand why or how it is just Sundays. 

I work a pretty consistent work schedule - but I had more than 2 weeks off for Christmas (this is normal, same thing last two years), he still knows Sunday. Family is away and I give the treats? He still knows Sunday. We do hot family breakfast on Sundays - we do an extra on a different day due to holidays - he still knows Sunday. Skip it? He still skips his Sunday treat. 

Any schedule variation I can figure out that identifies a Sunday - is meaningless and does not change his treat schedule. 6 during the week, abstain on Sundays. 


How. How does he know. And why?! We joke he has become religious in his old age (turns 12 in a few weeks) but I really don’t know.

So before I start this, I'm well aware that I can get great quality shots out of the flair - and I have been! I love the thing. I use a bottomless basket on it and I have a good distribution tool and tamper.

I get a good central flow with minimal or no channeling pretty consistently.

I make coffee for my wife every morning. She loves it, I love it, it's a great part of our routine. There's minimal steaming involved since I usually make her iced drinks with oat milk and syrup or something. Then I make myself a pour over or aeropress since I like black coffee. However, I am starting to get annoyed that I can really only make a single shot of espresso before needing to tear down, clean, and re-set up. Sometimes I want more, or she does! Sometimes I do like a straight espresso or americano. 

I currently use a kindgrinder k6 for espresso and an encore for pour over or AP.

I have been looking at the gaggia classic e24 very enviously. That thing looks sweet. And I already have an espresso capable grinder so I won't need to blow $300 more. Maybe just a bottomless portafilter and a tamper.

Is it worth it to get that? If I do get it, could I be easily pulling 2-3 double shots a morning if I'm not using steam? Or would I be better off getting another bottomless basket for the flair and just getting over the extra steps? 

I haven't made an update to my coffee stuff in a few years so my budget is around $600 USD. Could be flexible if there is some amazing machine I haven't heard of yet, but I definitely don't need a dual boiler or anything crazy. I'm not too picky really, just looking for the ability to make a few shots back to back easier than the flair, and if it's worth it.

I found a recipe on pinterest that had me working in increments of 60 g water and flour. I fed the starter with bleached flour (i didn’t know).

Honestly i don’t want to restart just because i have 10-11 days into this thing, but im wondering if ive just royally screwed up and need to restart, or if i can save this thing!

At the time of writing this, this cruise sails on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

Booking was done directly on panstarcruise.com and the process was pretty straightforward, even with an international credit card. As we were two man, we opted for the inside twin cabin with shared bathroom at 115 000 won per person. My understanding is that a man and a woman cannot share this type of cabin and needs to take a deluxe cabin at 225 000 won. There are also others options available depending on the dates, including dorms on tatami.

Few days before departure, the hour of sailing had changed from 3 to 5 pm, and we never received any warning email about it. So it might be a good idea to confirm a few days early on your online account.

On the day of departure, we arrived at Osaka Port International Ferry Terminal 50 minutes before the hour of departure as we saw a comment on Google maps saying this was fine. But turned out we were almost the last one to get in. According to the ticket, boarding starts 2 hours before departure, and the website state to arrive 90 min in advance. The boat even sailed 25 min before the official departure time. I would definitely advice to arrive a bit more in advance than us. You can bring all of your luggage with you on the ship (no checked luggage).

The boat itself, the Panstar Dream, was a mixed feeling. The cabin was a bit old but fine, and beds were comfortable. But from the inside of the boat, they were very few common area were you could sit and look outside. The restaurant only have a few windows and cannot be use out of the meal hours. There is a convience store with a few more windows, but your best bet will be the cafe, but it has very random opening schedules. The cafe is also the only place on the boat that has wifi, so no wifi in your cabin or anywhere else. Economy passengers only have access to the side and back of the boat, deluxe passenger seems to have access to a lounge with a view from the front. Deluxe passenger also enjoy a window, which might give them access to cellular network (our inside cabin had zero reception). There is a sauna/pool accessible which is your only option for showering (so no privacy). But the pool and sauna were a bit disappointing as both of them were barely warm (at least for Japanese standards). At night, there is a 1 hour karaoke event which was pleasant to go see other passengers sign for all of us. Finally, there is a duty free store. The advertised sushi restaurant on their website wasn’t in operation.

While there are some food available at the convience store or the cafe at prices not too inflated, and we could have brought our own food, we opted for the dinner/breakfast option at 20 000 won (included with deluxe rooms). Both buffet were good with many choices of meat, noodles, rice, fruits and side dishes. The breakfast was particularly elaborate but lacked coffee. Schedule of the meals were a bit tight, as dinner is served from 18:30 to 19:30 and breakfast from 7:30 to 8:30.

Be warn that the boat is rocking a bit, even on the pretty calm sea. The portion from Busan to Fukuoka is probably the worst. It wasn’t an issue for us, but we heard some passengers having difficulties. In Japan, the boat is going under many bridges, which is quite nice to look at.

In general, I had a good experience. People working on board were helpful and communication in English was no issue. While the experience could have been a bit better on some aspect, I feel what was delivered with the quite affordable asked price. ",13,1736215775.0,travel,4,0.93,False

Growing up, I clashed a lot with my parents due to our differences in personality. My parents are rigid, unemotional, and have a “toughen up” attitude, while I’m the opposite—I’m soft, sensitive, and feel my emotions deeply. I also struggled with untreated mental health issues, but my parents dismissed mental health as attention-seeking and ignored my cries for help. This led to frequent arguments. Sometimes, Jen was around during these fights, and she often sided with my parents. Like them, Jen didn’t really understand or care much for emotions or expressing them. I think her upbringing contributed to that. But because she was so similar to my parents in this way, I often felt ganged up on when they mocked me for crying or being angry.

Naturally, I distanced myself from Jen at times, thinking, “fuck this.” However, Jen always made an effort to stay in my life, wanting to remain close. To be fair, Jen never did anything truly terrible. Yes, she invalidated my feelings often, but she could have done far worse. As a result, our relationship has been on and off over the years.

Recently, I decided to reach out to her again. We’re older now, and when I messaged her, she was super excited. We went out for coffee and lunch, and while the meeting went well overall, those same old frustrations resurfaced.

I understand that some people tend to dump all their problems on their friends or constantly complain, and I’ve always been mindful not to be that person. Growing up, I didn’t have anyone to talk to—my parents were the source of my issues, and Jen, my supposed best friend, was rarely in my corner. My parents often called me “a crybaby” or told me the story of “the boy who cried wolf,” making me feel like no one wanted to be around someone who expressed their emotions openly. As a result, I bottled up my feelings. I cried often, but I rarely vented or complained to anyone.

Life isn’t all positive vibes and good times. It can be cruel and unfair, and while a positive attitude can help, it can only get you so far. As my best friend, I’d expect Jen to let me share my experiences, especially about pivotal moments in my life. Over the past few years, I’ve had to overcome significant struggles, including being hospitalized and digging myself out of a deep personal and emotional ditch. These challenges have shaped who I am today and are crucial to understanding my journey.

When Jen asks me how I’ve been and what my life has been like, I expect to share at least some of what I’ve been through. I’m not trauma dumping or unloading every detail onto her or any of my friends. In fact, I share very little about my life—only my family and closest friends know the deeper details. Jen has always said she wants to be one of those closest friends, my best friend. But when I try to share anything meaningful or life-changing, she becomes visibly awkward and uncomfortable, then abruptly changes the subject.  
It’s frustrating and hurtful because being a best friend means being there for the highs and lows. Jen says she wants to be that person for me, but her actions make me feel like I can’t even talk to her about the things that matter most. I just don't know where I stand with Jen or what to think.

  
**TL;DR:** I (24F) have a childhood best friend, Jen (23F), who has been in my life since I was 8. Despite our long history, we’ve had an on-and-off friendship due to her tendency to invalidate my emotions, especially when it came to my struggles with mental health and difficult family dynamics. Recently, I reached out to reconnect, but I was reminded of the same frustrations. When I tried to share my life experiences, including the challenges I’ve overcome, she became awkward and changed the subject. While Jen says she wants to be my best friend, her actions make me feel like I can’t open up to her, which leaves me questioning our relationship.",2,1736215572.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1hvgdod,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1hvgdod/an_apple_a_day/,An Apple a Day,"I woke up late today. It was well after 6 AM. Not particularly rested. A part of me wonders of I am losing my mind. Is it paranoia?

Or worse?

....

I felt unusually optimistic. Last night I decided to take the road. There is something I've been putting off. No longer.

I think I had around $32 -$33 total.

.....

1st stop. Walmart. Buy a five gallon gas can for jugging.

I'm debating within myself. Should I get the two gallon jug which isn't as intimidating for someone to help? Or should I be realistic? This is a full size truck. California is treacherous. So are a few neighboring states. I don't want to run out of gas and not have the ability to get somewhere safe with one full can.

Mountains. Deserts. Big cities where I know absolutely no one. Besides. I have a knack for pissing people off.

....

I'm practicing a craft, while tapping into my creative side. It's a hobby. Too many holes to be published or even get gigs as a freelancer.

Nobody is looking for this.

On the homeless sun I wasn't effective in my use of hyperbole and satire. Even my explanation was pissing people off.

That's not my intention. I'll stick to stories.

....

When I get to the shopping center I decide to fly a sign until I change my mind. Looking back I know my mind was made up, but the trip wasn't wasted. It turned out to be a great start for a day that would be problematic.

I park. See a local, with wild hair, pushing a shopping cart. He circles in front of me. He seems off, but not dangerous. I sit in the safety of my truck drinking coffee. I outweigh him by 40 lbs. He probably has a knife bigger than my dick.

He settles down. I'm just hoping he doesn't read Reddit.

I wave and speak to him with normal pleasantries. He waves and says Hi.

As I'm walking to my spot, he says something that I truly didn't understand.

I walk over. This could be interesting.

He repeats himself.

""The birds aren't real.""

(I remember when Ginger - a stripper with a snake on the side of her thigh - told me her house glowed in the dark and she had sex with the devil. You know you've got some goody pussy when the devil wants to break a piece of.)

""What makes you say that?""

""You see those birds? Now they're gone.""

I'm not so sure he's wrong. Someone with a similar thought pattern made generational wealth off that same idea.

Red pill. Blue pill. 

.....

I'm laughing now. Not at him. He really brightened my day. A modern day philosopher with plenty of time to think about how the world really works.

.....

I stand on that corner for less than 15 minutes. I need to get down the road. It wasn't calling me. If anything. I was just testing a theory. Based on hope. With a tad bit of faith. Enough faith to hit the gas and see some beautiful scenery on my way out of town.

....

My first attempt to get some fuel wasn't working. I could tell these people are no longer seeing the misery before them. They purposely avoid eye contact and speed up.

Finally, an Asian lady gives me $3. She had a fistful of cash. I was happy for the $3 but I'm literally on empty. I have her $3 and another sevm leftover from the gas can.

I probably spend at least an hour. Change places. Still no luck. I put the $3 in my gas can and walk to the truck.

Gas is going everywhere but the tank.

Apparently Ford has an EZ cap, that's impossible to put gas in.

I can only afford the red funnel with the narrow spout. Still no luck.

My $3 in gas is on the ground. I find a mechanic at Walmart.

""Try a coat hanger.""

Dude literally walked into the store and lifted a coat hanger for me. The hangar had a barcode on it. I don't steal. At least not since I was in my 20s.

Still no luck. I can't get this to open.

After checking YouTube, I found out the truck has a special funnel that must be used. Thank God it was next to the jack. The YouTuber saved the day.

I put a few drops into the tank and was thankful that nobody filled that can up.

....

Chick-fil-A and Starbucks have been good to me and so have their customers.

I'm shooting blanks.

I change tactics. Grab the NEED WORK sign. I'm dirty. Greasy hair. No luck.

I walk back to my truck and just write HUNGRY on the back. 

Now people are waving. The energy shifted.

$4. Score.

I pull my truck up to the pump. I put the $4 in and that light is still on with a message. 37 miles till empty.

I'm not in a part of the country for hitchhiking. I left that place and don't have a way back. This will be a long walk.

....

I drive up the road a bit. Get lost. Figure I have about 20 miles left, but the gas mileage is terrible. I'm in a city and don't know where.

.....

The homebums are everywhere like termites. Nobody is flying a sign and I'm thinking I should give them money. Enough of that I need out of here.

......

I decide to fly a sign in the median. I'm the only one and traffic is backing up at  every light.

Less than an hour later I have $7. Not great but I can get to friendlier ground.

.....

Then I spot it, like an Oasis in the desert. 

I get out with my can. 

I see some dude looking at me with a bandana on like he was Billy the Kid. I'm old. I don't know the styles, but he looks like he's about to get a lick. He keeps driving.

I wave. Holding my gas can close to my body. I'm still miserable.

I decide to eat two apples. After the first bite, I was feeling good. Halfway through I'm waving at people, making myself known with my gas can.

By he end of the second apple, my left hand was fully outstretched with my index finger pointing in the air. My right hand - holding the can - was stretched away from me about eye level.

Please. See me. I can tell I'm in the right community. Even white dudes my age are waving. 

....

A blue SUV with a younger Spanish lady + probably mid twenties - pulls over. I leave plenty of room between me and her car. She holds a $20 bill out the window.

Score. Record time.

I drive my truck to the gas station and put the whole 20 bucks in my tank. It's the first time today my truck had a quarter of a tank. 

I've got a long drive ahead of me.

....

I will be crossing terrain which is unfamiliar. Tomorrow it's back to the sign. Find a good spot. Park. Get a quick lick. I need some cash so I don't get stranded.

I may just go with the HUNGRY card. I don't mind working l, but I'm one greasy SOB.

....

Tonight. I feast. It's either Ramen and red beans, or the dumpster pays off. There is a particular food chain that has positive reviews in trashwiki. I haven't checked this city. I will later.

I finally know where I am, and once it gets darker, I will check the dumpster report for good finds in this area.

Coffee and two apples. 

I'm full from yesterday, but I don't know how tomorrow will turn out. I need to eat. Just in case Billy the Kid shows up.

.....

I'm confident that on any decently traveled road in America I can get a ride to the gas station. The problem is - it's a big ask for them to pay for it too.

....

Found Blue corn ships in a Waste Management can. A full 26 oz bottle of 7-UP and an almost empty Fruit Punch. Someone also gave me a large bottle of water. 

So far so good.

1hvgabk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hvgabk/my_best_friend_disappeared_in_1998_ive_just_found/,My best friend disappeared in 1998. I've just found him inside of a tree.,"When I met Blake, my life changed. I'd never had a real friend until I met him. Even in kindergarten, I'd be that weird kid who'd spend recess on his own in the corner. It was in the Summer of 1993. Blake's family moved in a few streets down from us. His mother Lilibet, determined to worm her way into the country club, knocked on the door of the largest house in the suburb and presented my mom with a fresh peach cobbler. They too were inseparable from that day forth.

Every time Lilibet would come around for a wine evening with my mother, she'd bring Blake along. I never knew what his father worked as, but I did know that he was only ever around on the weekends. I hit it off with Blake instantly. We'd spend long summer evenings upsetting wasp nests and drinking Hawaiian Punch while our mothers kept a loose eye on us from the porch. 

My backyard doesn't really end, instead it leads into the green blanket of Jefferson National Forest. Blake and I would spend hours playing in the maze of trees, building forts and sword fighting with sticks. We'd dare each other further and further into the woods, but eventually one of us would always chicken out before we went too deep. Usually me. Blake was my best friend for five years. We'd still hang out every day even after our parents had a major falling out. I suppose we both knew that we had no one else to fill our time with.

He went missing on a sticky Summer day in 1998. His mother had begrudgingly dropped him off at my house. My mother asked Blake about his day before we went out exploring, as we put it, into the forest. Once we were far enough from my house, Blake took out the flip knife he'd stolen from his father. We played around with it for a while, taking turns doing the slowest finger finger fillet imaginable and using it to sharpen twigs into arrows. 

It was while we were playing that stupid knife game that I managed to stab myself through my middle finger. I cursed and grimaced and tried not to cry in front of Blake. I slumped onto a rotting, moss covered log and nursed my mutilated finger. For some reason, I thought blowing on it would help. Blake made an unhelpful joke before picking the knife up and sitting next to me. I told him I was fine and he started to list off some facts he knew about tetanus. I shoved him off the log and we both laughed. 

Blake got up, brushing the leaves off himself and told me he'd just gotten a great idea. He said that while we had the knife, we should carve our names into a tree. That way, anyone who sees the message will know that Blake and Robby are best friends. I told him it was a great idea and that he should pick out the sturdiest tree he can find while I go get a plaster. 

Blake began his expedition and I walked back to the house, holding my still-bleeding figure in an old tissue. I didn't realise how close we were to my house until it quickly came into view and I hoped my mother hadn't heard me swearing. She was lying back on a deckchair, reading a gossip magazine and sipping from a glass of white wine. She jumped up as soon as she noticed my hand. 

Soon after, my finger was lathered in germolene and wrapped in a bandaid. I lied and told my mother that I'd cut it on a particularly sharp stone. She seemed to buy it, or at least I thought she did. She told me to be more careful and sent me on my way, shaking her head and muttering something about me being reckless. I wandered back into the woods to look for Blake. 

I stumbled across the old fallen tree I'd been using as a bench, which lay just out of view of my house. I looked around but didn't see Blake. I called his name and got no reply. I started to meander around, weary that Blake could jump out at me at any second. He was always like that, playing tricks on me. Once he left his grandmother's old doll that he knew I hated in my room after a sleepover. He still wishes that he'd been there to see my reaction. 

I'm wandering between the trees, further from my garden and deeper into the unrelinquishing forest. Something catches my eye. A metallic glint. I turn to see an old oak tree, its limbs tangled and broken like a car crash victim. It was the oldest tree on the property, as far we knew. It lay right on the invisible boundary where our land ended and the administration of the United States Forest Service began. I begged my father to let me build a treehouse on its branches when I was younger, but the answer was forever “no”.

I took a step closer. I saw what had caught my eye. Blake's flip knife was sticking out of the bark, around shoulder height. I looked at it, puzzled, and grabbed the handle. With some effort, I managed to pull it out. Blake must've lodged it in deep. I felt the weight of it in my hand, trying to balance it on my index finger. Blake had cleaned my blood off the blade. I guess he picked the old oak as the tree we should carve our message into. 

I pocketed the knife and looked around. Still no sign of Blake. I still wasn't convinced that he wasn't just hiding behind a bush somewhere, ready to pounce on me as I walked past. I called his name again. No reply. Only the sound of wind echoing between the wooden mesh entangled branches. Worry began to set in.

I heard my mother call us in. Pizza was ready, apparently. All I'd had to eat that day was a stick of apple flavoured chewing gum that I had accidentally swallowed, so pizza was an alluring mistress. I looked around and spoke in no particular direction. 

“Come on Blake, Mom made pizza. Homemade this time as well, none of that frozen crap”

I was sure that he'd hear me and come running out, eventually. I made my way out of the forest and back towards my house.

“Where's Blake?” My mother asked as I sat down on the Picnic table. 

“He's around, somewhere” I replied, “I reckon he was trying to prank me. He'll come crawling out of his hiding spot as soon as he smells this”.

We laughed and began to eat. By the time we'd finished, Blake's portion was still lying cold on his paper plate, now congealed in grease. Mom began to worry. She was like Blake's second mother, and practically was his mother when his parents were going through their divorce. As soon as I finished, she sent me back out to the forest to look for him. This time she came with me. 

Half an hour later, there was still no sign. My mother made me walk her through our entire afternoon. I confessed to her that we'd been playing with a knife. I immediately felt like I shouldn't have. She berated me about safety, but stopped suddenly as she began to think the worst of what could've happened to Blake. She'd didn't tell me, not wanting to upset me, but I could tell what she was thinking. What if Blake had cut himself? Worse, what if he'd been running, knife in hand, and tripped on a root. 

My mother called Lilibet soon after. She arrived before the hour's end and started a screaming match with mom as soon as she burst through our front door. Something about losing her sweet baby boy. I wasn't sure, I had my hands over my ears for most of it. The police came next. They assured us thar since he'd only been gone for a little more than an hour, there shouldn't be anything to worry about. He was probably sitting by a tree, nursing a twisted ankle.

Lilibet filled in a missing people's report just after sundown. The rest of the day was a hectic search. Eventually my mother told me to go back inside and go to bed. I protested, wanting to be the one to find him, but eventually relented. She led me back to the house and tucked me into bed before she rejoined Lilibet. I managed to fall asleep, weariness winning the battle against worry. I was woken up my talking just outside of my bedroom window. I checked the time.

 6:02.

I rolled out of bed and went to my window and peered outside. There was a group of people congregated in the garden. A search party. A few carried torches, although it was already bright enough to see clearly. I recognised some of the men from around town. Mr Hall, my geography teacher, was the first one to catch my eye. He gave me a sympathetic wave and went back to listening to the police officer, who was organising the group into smaller parties. Soon thereafter, they set off into the woods.

By the time that i got up, Blake had been gone for 15 hours. It's a myth that you have to wait 24 hours to report someone missing. Really, you should do it as soon as their absence becomes suspicious. Some law enforcers do suggest waiting 24 hours, but that's just an advisory. Or a polite way of saying “Ma’am, could it be that your husband is just black-out drunk in a ditch somewhere?”.

That day, the search party found nothing. Not a piece of cloth or lost shoe. There was no trace of Blake at all. The police brought in sniffer dogs, which were equally ineffective. The searches began to pitter out after three weeks. Local law enforcement explained there was simply nothing more they could do. Still, people didn't give up hope. Lilibet would spend hours on her own, wandering through the woods looking for her son. She'd often turn up at our house late at night, looking for a place to stay so she could resume the search as soon as her tired body allowed her. It was a wonder that she never got lost herself. 

Police suspicion immediately fell on my father, even though he was working at the time of the disappearance.  He had a criminal record from his teenage years, nothing major, but they used it as rope to tie his noose. As the Sheriff kept repeating that they had no new information, the townsfolk became increasingly agitated. They tried desperately to use my father as a scapegoat, a patsy, but there was nothing. No evidence that Blake had even left my backyard, let alone for a murder. My father avoided jail, but not the death of his reputation. 

My father lost his job. Although he was never convicted, the stigma of being the lead suspect in a missing child case was not good for a children’s ombudsman. He couldn't find work anywhere in town. Months had passed now since Blake's disappearance. I was back to being friendless and heavily bullied at school. I'd still walk home with Blake everyday though, as his missing posters lined every lamppost from the school to my house. 

My mother began working again, being able to return to her position at the local women's college. It was enough to keep our family afloat, but not my parents' marriage. Their divorce was finalised on millennium Eve. I knew it was coming, although I enjoyed ignoring the signs. My father spent most of 1999 drunk at home. 

High-school was a nightmare, but at least it gave me a sense of normalcy. I like to think that I was a good student. Not that it mattered. I had to drop out of college in 2008 to care for my mother. She passed away from lung cancer in 2009, leaving me alone with the family home and more debt than I'd be worth in a decade. I lost contact with my father after my mother's funeral. Last I knew he was living in a trailer park near the coast. 

I should've sold the house. Anyone in my family I still talked to told me that. The place was far too big for one person. Too hollow. I should've sold it, but I didn't. Buried in the walls of that house were the memories of my happy childhood, and that was priceless. I did have to sell almost every item of furniture, every piece of jewellery, every last possession just to keep my head above water. Worst of all, I had to work in retail. 

My life was at a dead end. Every day was the same as its predecessor, and will undoubtedly be the same as its successor. I'd wake up, go to work, come home, eat, drink, sleep and wake up again the next morning. The only thing that kept me going was Lucy. She was a cashier at the small corner shop I worked at. She was a little younger than me. Her parents had kicked her out when she was 19. The art college she attended kicked her out as well a few short years later. She ended up back here and has been stuck in a cycle of part-time jobs ever since.

We were good friends, as much as I wanted us to be more. We'd go out for drinks as often as we could, sometimes catch a movie at the local arthouse cinema. She's dated a few guys in the time I've know her, but nothing that didn't last more than a few weeks. I was comfortable with our friendship. I didn't want to end up like just another month-long romance. So, I kept acting like I was content with her calling me “the brother she never had”. If you're reading all of this and thinking that it sounds unhealthy and just a tad pathetic, then you're undoubtedly right. 

I just don't want to rock the boat. 

The night it happened began with me slumped across the front room sofa, gorging myself on off-brand cheese puffs and watching trash tv. I wiped the orange power from my fingers with my vest, picked up my phone and messaged Lucy. 

Do u want to come over for movie night??

It took her a while to reply.

Look out your window. It's the storm of the century outside. 

She had a point, I admit. It was the first big storm to hit us in 2016. It wasn't that bad now, but it was set to wreak havoc in a few hours. Lucy and I lived within a ten minute walk of each other's houses. She’d usually pop over whenever she got frustrated with her housemate, which was often. 

Good movie weather 

I chuckled at my own message. Lucy didn't reply for a few minutes, long enough for my show about housewives to end another about fishermen on steroids to begin. 

lol

I took that as a no and set my phone back down on the coffee table. I rolled over and went back to watching the TV screen, regardless of whatever was being shown. I just switched my mind off. 

I didn't realise that I had fallen asleep until I was woken up. I groaned and slowly sat upright, the stale flavour of artificial cheese and malibu on my breath. I sat there listening to the rain until I decided to get up and investigate the noise that dragged me awake. I stumbled through the living room and into the kitchen. I fumbled with the wall until my hand found the lightswitch, although I could tell what the problem was already. 

The light came on and I saw that I'd left a window wide open. The curtains had caught the wind and knocked over a plant pot. The tiled floor was covered in dirt and bits of dead philodendron. I sighed and poured myself a glass of water, trying not to get mud on my slippers as I sat down in what used to be my father's chair at the dinner table. I swished the water around in my mouth and turned the kitchen light off so I could see outside. I sat back down and stared at the swaying trees at the foot of my backyard. 

At times like this all I can think about is Blake. I wondered if he was still out there, somewhere. If I remembered correctly, the last theory from the county police was that he fell down a small cave entrance, one they, or anyone else, never could find. I spat the rinse back into my cup, then shrugged my shoulders and drank it. 

Suddenly, the room was filled with a spectacular light. I squinted as I saw lightning strike just beyond the treeline. It was over in a split second. Thunder followed immediately after. I laughed to myself, feeling sorry for all the dog owners in the neighbourhood. I never had one, but Blake did, for a while. Charles I think his name was. Blake would tell me about how Charles would howl and whimper his way through every storm. 

I stopped laughing when I saw the glow. It was faint at first, when slowly grew brighter. I got to my feet leaned over the sink, pressing my forehead against the glass pane. There was definitely dull orange glow coming from the woods. Fire was the first thing that came to my mind. Back in June, a fire was started in a campervan lot, not all that far away. It burnt down a few people's livelihoods. The News reporters said that that had been started by lightning. 

I began opening random draws until I found a torch. I made sure it was working, grabbed a coat and headed outside. I almost slipped on the wooden steps of the deck. I trudge across the garden, which had been turned to mud by the storm, and continued on towards the glow. Some cover from the rain was granted as I crossed the treeline. The beam of my torch fell over a mat of rotten leaves and twigs, a fallen log and finally, an old Oak tree. 

The bolt of lightning had split the thing almost in half. Part of the tree was strewn, still smouldering, on the ground. The smell of charred timber overpowered the petrichor. The split edges of the oak were a ring of embers, the source of the orange glow that led me here. I took a step closer and was stopped by sudden realisation. This was the tree Blake was intent on carving our names into. The tree I found his flick knife sticking out of. The tree I knelt at every year on the anniversary of his disappearance to pray to St Anthony. 

Tears clouded my version as I realised I'd lost my last connection to him. I was confident that the rain would dampen any attempt the fire made at spreading. I sniffed and turned around to walk back to my dry home. 

“Robbie.”

I froze. Someone had called my name. It was almost hidden by the wind, but I was sure of it. 

“Robbie.”

It was a voice I recognised. I turned around in circles, bewildered, scanning my surroundings for the source. 

“Robbie… please.”

I stared at the splintered Oak tree. I found it. On unsteady feet I stepped closer and closer still to the scorched stump. I turned my torch onto its brightest setting and leaned over the side of the stump, flashing the beam down its center. 

The heartwood was hollowed out. In the middle of the tree, encased in oak up to his shoulders, was a small child. It was Blake. 

“Robbie… please free me.” 

I stared in shock and pure disbelief. I could tell my hand was shaking from how much the light danced around. It was Blake but… he's changed. His skin had the same colour and texture as dried leaves. His eyes were milk white with a yellow tinge. His hair was a dirty mess and his scalp was… crumblin. He was still wearing the same red shirt he had on the day of his disappearance, but it had now faded to the point of greyness. Despite all this, I knew it was really him. I finally, after all these years, had him back. And he hadn't aged a day. 

“Blake”, I whimpered, “it's really you.”

I reached out to try and hug him but he hissed at me. I'm sure he was scared and confused like me. 

“Blake, please, I'm trying to get you out. Just hold onto my hands and I'll pull you out!”

Blake let out a long, rasping “No” before saying “Only blood can free me.”

I took a cautious step back. “Blood? Blake, what are you talking about?”

“Bring me blood. Bath me in it, Robbie. Free me.” 

We stared into each other's eyes for a long moment, then Blake's face contorted into a sickening grin. I turned and ran, straight back to the house. I fell into a glut of mud but stumbled back to my feet. I clambered up my deck and fell through the glass sliding doors. I pulled the curtains shut with such force I broke a few of the rings. I tore off my sodden clothes as I ran upstairs. I collapsed onto the bed in my childhood bedroom and fumbled around with the bedside cabinet looking for my Zolpidem. I took four and turned over for a restful night. 

For a blissful few seconds when I woke up, I couldn't recall the events of the night prior. And then it hit me. I laid in bed until I couldn't justify it anymore. I got up and made my way downstairs. The first thing I did was grab a broom and clean, as best I could, the dirt and broken pottery on the kitchen floor. Once it was acceptably clean, I made myself a coffee and sat down on the chair that had been turned to face the window. I took a scolding sip and internally debated what I should do as I watched the trees sway in the afternoon wind. By the time the mug was empty, I had decided to talk to Blake again. 


I made my way out of the house and onto the now familiar trail from my garden out through the woods to the Oak tree. Until I saw its split facade, I thought there was still a chance it had been all a dream. Any hopes of that ended when I saw Blake squirming around in the stump. He stopped moving when he saw me and smiled. 

“Who've come back Robbie”

“I… I want to help you Blake”, I said in a voice barely more than a whisper.

“You can help me, Robbie. Bring me blood.”

I stared at Blake in disbelief. I didn't know what to do. What to say. Every time I looked at him I felt this weird sense of… of joy. I've wanted a chance to see him one last time every day for the past eighteen years. Now here it was, and I was thinking about turning my back on him? I couldn't understand what was going on, but I knew what I had to do. 

“Wh… why do you need blood?” I managed to stutter out.

“It will bring me back”, replied Blake, “Isn't that what you want?”

I looked into his blank eyes and saw compassion. It was something I hadn't felt in years. 

""Ok.” I said. “I'll do it. I'll help you.”

Blake whispered a “thank you Robbie” as I turned and walked away. I went back into the house to grab my wallet, my jacket and the keys. I locked up and got in my car. I single mindedly drove to the nearest butchers. I parked on a double yellow line and made my way into some generic, corporate butcher shop. The walls were lined with cured meats and pictures of oddly happy looking cartoon pigs. 

I leaned over the counter and was greeted by a barrel-shaped middle aged man who didn't look all that different from the animals he sold. 

“Do you sell blood?” I asked in earnest.

“Blood?” replied the Butcher “well sure we do, don't get much call for it though. How much can I do you for?”

I realised I wasn't exactly familiar with blood measurements so I told him “I'll take a gallon.”
The Butcher sniffed and disappeared into the back. He returned a moment later with a large plastic container covered in frost. 

“I'm afraid we only have pork blood in stock, if that's alright.”

“Oh sure, that's fine. I think.” I told him. 

“Perfect. That'll be eighteen dollars”.

I grimaced at the thought of giving up almost three hours wages for a fool's errand, but on the other hand my social anxiety prevented me from asking him to get a smaller portion. I reluctantly paid in full and waved the portly man a goodbye. The blood had began to thaw on the back seat of my car, leaving a stain I knew I'd never get out. 

I pulled into my driveway and got out. I opened the back door and unbuckled the seat belt around the container of blood. I don't know why I put a seat belt around it, it just felt right. I lugged the cumbersome thing out of my car and carried it through my home, out to the garden and into the forest. I heard a dull whispering coming from Blake. He stopped suddenly once her saw me. 

“Hello Robbie”, he said as I positioned myself in front of him.

“I got what you wanted”, I told him as I unscrewed the lid of the plastic jug. 

“Thank you Robbie”, he replied, “you're my best friend”.

I beamed a smile as I heaved the gallon of blood onto my shoulder. It began pouring out in a torrent, covering Blake completely in a clotless crimson. Enough of it splashed on my clothes to make it look like I've been butchering a deer. Once it was empty, I set it down next to the stump and waited for Blake to be free. 

The blood began seeping into his flesh and the wood that surrounded him. There was a sound like a drain emptying as the liquid receded. Within a minute, he was completely clean. I noticed, however, than his skin seemed noticeably looser. I stood back, expecting him to squirm out of his oak prison. Instead, his face fell and her spoke in a slightly lower pitched voice.

“I need fresh blood, Robbie. Bring me fresh blood and I'll be free.”

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 

“Fresh blood?” I stuttered, “what do you mean?” 

He repeated; “I need fresh blood, Robbie. Bring me fresh blood and I'll be free.”

I turned and stormed off. I thought I could help. I thought I was doing the right thing. But clearly, I couldn't help Blake. Even now. I returned to my house and collapsed onto the sofa in a depressive heap. I felt such a strong, almost unnatural compulsion to help but nothing I did felt like it made up for losing him. I knew it was dumb to blame myself, but at the back of my mind I always felt responsible. It's been tied around my conscience since I was 12 years old, and now that I could finally put things right, I was second guessing myself. 

Just then, the neighbour's cat jumped up on my windowsill. He curled up in a sunspot next to my box plants. I stared at his furry shape and realised what I must do. Slowly, I stood up from the couch and made my way into the kitchen. I grabbed the largest knife I could find from the draw and stepped outside. The cat belonged to my next door neighbour. It was a greying tabby, George I think it's name was. The neighbouring family got it when I was just a kid. I couldn't imagine how old he must be. I grabbed him by the tail. At his age, there wasn't much more he could ask for.

I brought this new offering to Blake. He seemed happier with it. With the knife, I managed to drain all the blood I could from that ginger ball of hair. Blake opened his mouth and stuck his grey, cracked tongue out as the blood dripped onto his face. He was like a small child experiencing snow for the first time. I felt a warmth deep inside me as he fed. 

“Is that better?’ I asked. 

Blake replied “I can taste life for the first time in years. Please, I need more.”

It was the answer I expected, an answer that I was resigned to. I had my best friend back, and I wasn't going to give him up. The next week was a blur of violence. Usually I had lunch with Lucy, but now I'd spend my breaks driving around town searching for lost pets and strays. I'd taken to using a sharpened screw driver. It was the most humane way. My findings would stay in the trunk of my until I could go home and feed their blood to Blake. He told me he was growing healthier, and was almost free, but it didn't seem like it.

His complexion was even more sickly than when I first found him. His skin was now a dark turquoise, had a texture like leather and looked like it was slowly falling off the flesh underneath. Seams had appeared all over the visible parts of his body, and they looked fit to burst. His left arm was free now. All he used it for was to play rock-paper-scissors with me. 

This particular day, I got off work and drove home with a pomeranian wrapped in a bin liner in my back seat. I began my usual routine soon after getting back to the house. I through the back over my shoulder and trudged over to Blake's part of the forest. He watched me intensely as I pulled the small dog out of the plastic bag. I took out my cutting knife, but before I could do anything, Blake spoke. 

“Why are you poisoning me?” 

I looked at him, shocked. I tried to hide the frustration in my voice when I replied. 

“What… what do you mean, Blake? I'm bringing you everything you asked for.”

Blake's child-like grin turned into a grimacing frown. Now, his facial expressions took ages to turn, as if he had to tell each individual muscle in his face how and where to move. 

“The blood of animals is sour to me now”, he said, “and yet you keep showering me in it? Do you want me to suffer, Robbie?”

I quickly jumped to my own defense. 

“No, no, of course not. What do you need instead?” I asked, already knowing the answer. 

“Human blood”.

Those two words directed the course of my life from then on. I spent the rest of the day tackling this moral quandary. First, I attempted to contact a blood bank to inquire about a withdrawal, but I quickly realised how tremendously stupid of an idea that was. The next thing I did was research how much blood could a person lose without dying. From Google, I found that a person could lose close to 40% of the entire volume and live. I decided then that I would try and remove this from myself. 

It felt fitting, after all, that it'd be my own blood that frees Blake. The next few days we're spent preparing. I checked in on Blake regularly, to see how he was doing without my blood supply. Not only was he fine, he looked more healthy and normal than he'd ever been. He insisted, however, that going this long without blood would kill him, so I endeavour to hurry up. 

I made a homemade IV out of sewing needles, a turkey baster and tubing from a long dormant fish tank. I sat down on a chair in the kitchen, the IV next to me over a plastic bucket. I spent an hour sterilising everything as best I could with what I had. I stabbed the needle into my cephalic vein and let gravity do the rest. Slowly but surely, the bucket began to fill up. 

I sat there until I felt dizzy. I groggily pulled the makeshift hypodermic needle out of my arm and collapsed back into the chair. After a few minutes, I managed to collect myself. I steadily got to my feet and looked at the bucket. There was barely any blood in it. I found a 1L measuring jug that I'd never used before and poured it in. It just about filled it to the brim. More than I thought but nowhere near enough. 

I brought the jug out to Blake, careful not to spill any. His blank eyes lit up when he saw me. I held the jug over him, his mouth hanging expectantly open. I poured my blood and he began to giggle, just like he would when we were kids. His gullet filled with my black clots and it began to overspill, dribbling down his chin and down onto his chest. Once the glass is empty, I let it fall to the floor. Blake began thanking me, calling me his best friend, saying we'd never part. I felt a warmth I hadn't experienced since before my mother died. Wood splintered as he pulled his other arm free. I knew what to do. I leaned in and we hugged each other. 

“We will never part again, Robbie.” 

“I know Blake. I'll never let you go again.”

He smelt like death but I didn't care. He pulled me tighter and whispered in my ear.

“But I'm still not free.”

I recoiled from his embrace. I should've known that he wouldn't be satiated. I had to avert my gaze from Blake. I could tell he was scowling at me. I walked back to the house, leaving Blake to calm down. I slumped onto my couch, trying to think of what I should do next. I noticed my phone on the coffee table. The past few days have been a mono focused blur. I couldn't remember the last time I picked up my phone. 

I grabbed it and immediately saw that Lucy had been trying to contact me. I had dozens of unread texts and missed calls from her. I'd been doing my best to avoid her at work. She tried to come round yesterday and I just hid in my room and pretended to be out. I tapped on the notifications and read through the catalogue of messages. All had the same theme; something to do with my well-being.

I lay back and decided to give her a call. The phone rang for a while before she picked up. She didn't sound as concerned as I thought she'd be, but she was happy to know I was all right. She repeated what she'd been saying over text, that I felt different. Distant. I told her that I was fine, really, and that she should come over tonight. She agreed, and said that she would be around at about 7 PM. We wished each other goodbye until then and I hung up. 

I had a plan. 

I knew that there was no other choice. If I wanted to free Blake, finally free him, then this is what I must do. I put on a jacket and slide a kitchen knife into the inside pocket. I sat and waited for Lucy. 

She arrived half an hour late, an impressive feat considering she only lived ten minutes away. I could tell that she knew that something was up. I didn't know what to do, so I blurted out that I had been diagnosed with depression. It seemed to click for her then what was wrong and she took to comforting me as best she could. Lucy had always been a tree-hugger. She made me try out veganism once or twice, but it never stuck. Hearing about my struggle, the first thing she suggested was that I should get out in nature more. She asked me if there was any place that I felt truly happy. I stifled a smile and told her that I knew a place. 

My heart beat like a tribal drum as I led Lucy from my house, through my garden and out into the forest. I stopped for a second, letting her walk just in front of me as we came up to the stump. A few steps later she saw it. 

Blake has metamorphosed since this morning. His skin had been replaced with a black mold. The only features of his face her his white eyes and teeth, floating in an inky nothingness. He didn't look like Blake at all anymore. His red t-shirt was gone, digested into his body. Wispy tendrils protruded  from all over his body and connected him to the ruined oak that rose on either side of him. He still sat comfortably within the stump but looked like he was beginning to spill out. 

Lucy let out a scream that sent the crows flying from their perch. Before she could run, before she could react, before she could do anything else, I grabbed her. I pushed her forward until she was inches from Blake's grinning maw. I took the knife from my pocket and slit her throat. Her screams turned to a gurgle and then ended. Blood poured from the wound and on to Blake, who still spoke with the voice of a child. 

“This is it”, he decreed, “just a little more.”

He was still saying that by the time her neck ran dry. I maneuvered her body, trying desperately not to throw up. I cut both of wrists and held her in place as the blood flowed. Suddenly, Blake began to bubble. Pustules sprang up and popped all over his body. He expanded, almost entirely enveloping the stump. I stumbled back and let Lucy's body fall. Blake's eyes rolled back into his head and disappeared, along with his teeth. His body had lost all shape now. It was just a black, writhing mass. 

Two hands pierced the top of the mass and split it open like a satchel. The man began to rise from the black pile, floating up through the air. It was a Native American man, he looked to be in his 60s, although his aura was unknowable old. His legs were covered in intricate symbols of red and white and he wore a tattered animal hide skirt. Around his neck was a carcanet of beads and feathers. He began speaking in a language I couldn't begin to understand. I only recognised one word. 

“Okeus.”

He didn't even look at me. He kept rising into the air, past the tree line and further still. I craned my neck and shielded my eyes from the evening sun. The man continued up into the sky until he came to a stop a hundred feet or so from the ground. His incantations hastened and he began to vibrate. Suddenly he exploded into a cloud of ash, which caught on the wind and fluttered away. I clambered over to the stump but the black mess had already begun to evaporate. There was no trace of Blake. There was no sign that he'd been there at all. There was nothing

I spent the next few years on the run for murder. My old life died with Lucy. In the past 8 years, I've written this account out dozens of times. It is my admission of guilt. Now, I am finally at peace with it. Make of it what you will and leave me unburdened. I don't know what I let into the world, but there is nothing left I can do.

# Introduction

*“We knew smaller, faster, cheaper better than anybody else in the world, and now we're applying those concepts to blockchain.” — Greg Fitzgerald, Solana co-founder*

Solana is a high-performance, low-latency blockchain renowned for its speed, efficiency, and focus on user experience. Its unique integrated architecture enables thousands of transactions per second across a globally decentralized network. With a block time of 400 milliseconds and transaction fees that are fractions of a cent, it delivers on both speed and cost-effectiveness. This report delves into the intricacies of Solana's design and operation, exploring the key mechanisms and network topology that contribute to its capabilities.

Solana takes an integrated approach to blockchain development, leveraging the founding team's decades of experience in building distributed systems. One of Solana's core principles is that software should never get in the way of hardware. This means that software exploits whatever hardware it runs on to the fullest and scales with it. As a unified ecosystem, all applications built on top of this single blockchain inherit composability, enabling them to interact and build upon each other seamlessly. This architecture also ensures a straightforward and intuitive user experience without the need for bridging, separate chain IDs, or liquidity fragmentation.

Solana is evolving rapidly, with recent developments including SVM rollups and [ZK Compression](https://www.zkcompression.com/) as important scaling solutions. While these projects may one day shape our future perception of Solana, they are currently in the very early stages of development or adoption and will not be covered in this report.

# Transaction Lifecycle

Our primary lens for understanding Solana throughout this report will be the lifecycle of a typical transaction. To construct a basic model for understanding Solana transactions, we can outline the process as follows: 

https://preview.redd.it/y27ncoggogbe1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f24f7d74ee34e53e7e15ad616c291587de0885b

* Users initiate transactions, all of which are sent to the current lead block producer (known as the leader). The leader compiles these transactions into a block, executing them and thereby updating their local state.
* This block of transactions is then propagated throughout the network for other validators to execute and confirm.

The subsequent sections of this report will expand this model and delve into this process in much greater detail, beginning with the key participants—the users.

# Remember

*Substantial changes to the core Solana protocol go through a formal, transparent* [*process*](https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/blob/main/proposals/0001-simd-process.md) *of submitting a Solana Improvement Document (SIMD) which community members and core engineering will publicly critique. SIMDs are then voted on by the network.*

# Six stages

https://preview.redd.it/bb6i7wxjogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=35d445455affd3993d91da00bf732ea4c01128a7

We will reference the six-stage visual shown above throughout this report, as it offers us a consistent framework for understanding the relationships between Solana's core elements.

Earlier chapters are arranged according to these six stages. The final chapters—Gossip, Archive, Economics, and Jito—tie up any loose ends. It’s important to note that some chapters will span multiple stages, and some stages will appear in multiple chapters.

This overlap is unavoidable because the six-stage framework has its limitations. In reality, Solana is a complex distributed system with many interdependent elements.

# Users

*“Solana has the potential to be the Apple of crypto” — Raj Gokal, Solana co-founder*

A user's journey typically begins by setting up and funding a wallet application. Multiple popular wallet applications are available for Solana, either as native mobile applications or browser extensions.

Wallets cryptographically generate user keypairs, consisting of public and private keys. The public key acts as the unique identifier for their account and is known by all participants in the network. A user’s account on Solana can be considered a data structure that holds information and state related to their interactions with the Solana blockchain. In this way, a public key is similar to a filename: just as a filename uniquely identifies a file within a file system, a Solana public key uniquely identifies an account on the Solana blockchain. Public keys on Solana are represented as 32-byte Base58-encoded strings.

`FDKJvWcJNe6wecbgDYDFPCfgs14aJnVsUfWQRYWLn4Tn`

A private key — also known as a secret key —can be considered as the password or access key that grants permission to access and modify the account. Signing with private keys is how blockchains handle authorization. Knowledge of the private key gives absolute authority over the account. Solana private keys are also 32-bytes in length. Keypairs are the 64-byte combinations of public (first half) and private (second half) keys. Examples:

`3j15jr41S9KmdfughusutvvqBjAeEDbU5sDQp8EbwQ3Hify2pfM1hiEsuFFAVq8bwGywnZpswrbDzPENbBZbd5nj`

`[63,107,47,255,141,135,58,142,191,245,78,18,90,162,107,197,8,33,211,15,228,235,250,30,185,122,105,23,147,115,115,86,8,155,67,155,110,51,117,0,19,150,143,217,132,205,122,91,167,61,6,246,107,39,51,110,185,81,13,81,16,182,30,71]`

Private keys can also be derived from mnemonic seed phrases, usually 12 or 24 words long. This format is often used in wallets for easier backup and recovery. Multiple keys can be derived deterministically from a single seed phrase.

Solana utilizes [Ed25519](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA#Ed25519), a widely used elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, for its public-key cryptography needs. Ed25519 is favored for its small key size, small signature size, fast computation, and immunity to many common attacks. Each Solana wallet address represents a point on the Ed25519 elliptic curve.

https://preview.redd.it/astjuuasogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7094772d293060d90b5e9e70e2d4c65a13fe3a

The user signs transactions with their private key. This signature is included with the transaction data and can be verified by other participants using the sender's public key. This process ensures the transaction has not been tampered with and is authorized by the owner of the corresponding private key. The signature also acts as a unique identifier for the transaction.

# Solana Transactions

Sending a transaction is the only way to mutate state on Solana. Any write operation is performed through a transaction, and transactions are atomic—either everything the transaction attempts to do happens or the transaction fails. A transaction, more formally known as a ""transaction message,"" comprises four sections: a header, a list of account addresses, a recent blockhash, and instructions.

https://preview.redd.it/yl7lvpouogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5349733808055e00bf0a209ed2174abd529619d7

* Header: The header contains references to the account address list, indicating which accounts must sign the transaction.
* Account Addresses: This list includes all the accounts that will be read from or written to during the transaction. Building such a list for every transaction is a requirement unique to Solana and can be challenging for developers. However, knowing in advance which pieces of state a transaction will interact with enables optimizations not possible on many other blockchains.
* Recent Blockhash: This is used to prevent duplicate and stale transactions. A recent blockhash expires after 150 blocks (about 1 minute). By default, RPCs attempt to forward transactions every 2 seconds until the transaction is either finalized or the recent blockhash expires, at which point the transaction is dropped.
* Instructions: These form the core part of the transaction. Each instruction represents a specific operation (e.g., transfer, mint, burn, create account, close account). Each instruction specifies the program to execute, the accounts required, and the data needed for the instruction's execution.

The number of instructions in a transaction is limited first by its size, which can be up to 1,232 bytes. There are also limits around the number of accounts that can be referenced. Lastly, there are limits to a transaction’s complexity measured in compute units (CUs). CUs quantify the computational resources expended in processing transactions.

# Remember

*The smallest unit of SOL is known as a ""lamport,"" equivalent to one billionth of a SOL, similar to a satoshi in Bitcoin. The lamport is named after* [*Leslie Lamport*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport)*, a computer scientist and mathematician whose research established many theoretical foundations of modern distributed systems.*

The cost in SOL to execute a transaction is separated into 2 parts - a base fee and a prioritization fee. The base fee is a fixed 5000 lamports per signature cost irrespective of the transaction’s complexity—usually, there is 1 signature per transaction.

Prioritization fees are technically optional, but during periods of high demand for blockspace become necessary. These fees are priced in micro-lamports (millionth of a lamport) per compute unit. Their purpose is to act as a price signal, making transactions more economically compelling for validator nodes to include in their blocks. 

`total fee = prioritization fee + base fee`

`prioritization fee = compute unit price (micro-lamports) x compute unit limit`

Currently, 50% of all transaction-related fees are burnt, permanently removing this SOL from circulation with the remaining 50% going to the block producer. A new change (SIMD 96) is soon to be introduced allowing for 100% of prioritization fees to go to the block producer. Base fees remain unchanged.

# Sending transactions

https://preview.redd.it/ciea7ftyogbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=0407e01298915f6b4310da6b5271465500f8be7d

A user connects their wallet to the application, allowing the app to read the user’s public key. The private key remains encrypted and securely sandboxed in a separate environment from the application.

The application builds the transaction message parameters based on the user’s interactions. For example, if a user wanted to swap two tokens, they would specify the amount of tokens to buy, the corresponding tokens to sell, and an acceptable transaction slippage.

‍Once the transaction message is ready, it is sent to the wallet to be signed with the user’s private key. At this point, the user is prompted with a popup to confirm their willingness to transact. This popup may include a simulation of the transaction’s results. Once signed, the transaction message and the signature are returned to the app, which can then forward the transaction to an RPC provider of their choice, either their own or by using the wallet’s provider.

‍RPC (Remote Procedure Call) providers act as intermediaries between applications and the validators that build blocks. They are an essential service that enables applications to [submit](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/cd6f931223181d5a1d47cba64e857785a175a760/rpc/src/rpc.rs#L3396) or simulate signed transactions and efficiently retrieve on-chain data. Applications that wish to interact with the network do so via a JSON-RPC or a WebSocket endpoint ([docs](https://solana.com/docs/rpc)).

# Remember

*The term “failed transaction” on Solana is misleading and has caused considerable confusion. These transactions incur fees and are executed successfully by the runtime exactly as the signer intended. They “fail” due to the transaction’s own logic requiring them to do so. +80% of “failed” transactions come from error code 0x1771, the code for exceeding slippage amount (*[*data*](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/zapokorny/q/18zuYlugBdcm/solana-failed-txs-by-program)*). Notably, 95% of these transactions are submitted by only 0.1% of active Solana addresses, primarily automated bots attempting to take advantage of time-sensitive price arbitrage opportunities.*

# Gulf Stream

*“Literally the goal of Solana is to carry transactions as fast as news travels around the world — so speed of light through fiber. Who we’re competing with is NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) refer to RPC nodes. These nodes can be thought of as gateways to interact with and read data from the network. They run the same software as full validators but with different settings, allowing them to accurately simulate transactions and maintain an up-to-date view of the current state. As of this writing, there are over 4,000 RPC nodes on the Solana network.

‍Unlike full validator nodes, RPC nodes do not hold any stake in the network. Without stake, they cannot vote or build blocks. This setup differs from most other blockchains, where the validator and RPC nodes are typically the same. Since RPC nodes do not receive staking rewards, the economics of running RPC nodes are distinct from those of validators with many operating as a paid service for developers running Solana applications.

‍Solana stands out because it was designed from the outset to operate without a mempool. Unlike traditional blockchains that use gossip protocols to randomly and broadly propagate transactions across the network, Solana forwards all transactions to a predetermined lead validator, known as the leader, for each slot.

https://preview.redd.it/efimg7g5pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4ddc929f7c96b3eb528f3d8768388853e1c62db

# Callout

*Solana operates four clusters: Localnet, Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet-Beta. When people refer to Solana or the Solana network, they almost always refer to Mainnet-Beta. Mainnet-Beta is the only cluster where tokens hold real value, while the other clusters are used solely for testing purposes.*

‍Once an RPC receives a transaction message to be included in a block, it must be forwarded to the leader. A leader schedule is produced before every epoch (approximately every two days). The upcoming epoch is divided into slots, each fixed at 400 milliseconds, and a leader is chosen for each slot. Validators with a higher stake will be chosen more often to become leader within each epoch. During each slot, transaction messages are forwarded to the leader, who has the opportunity to produce a block. When it is a validator’s turn, they switch to ""leader mode,"" begin actively processing transactions and broadcasting blocks to the rest of the network.

# ‍Stake-Weighted Quality of Service - SWQoS

‍In early 2024, Solana introduced a new mechanism aimed at preventing spam and enhancing Sybil resistance, known as ""Stake-Weighted Quality of Service"" (SWQoS). This system enables leaders to prioritize transaction messages that are proxied through other staked validators. Here, validators with a higher stake are granted a proportionally higher capacity to transmit transaction message packets to the leader. This approach effectively mitigates Sybil attacks from non-staked nodes across the network.

https://preview.redd.it/gacy1qn8pgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e510254be8f3dfe4465bb02297771ec19e98024

Under this model, validators can also engage in agreements to lease their stake-weighted capacity to RPC nodes. In return, RPC nodes gain increased bandwidth, allowing them to achieve greater transaction inclusion rates in blocks. Notably, 80% of a leader’s capacity (2,000 connections) is reserved for SWQoS. The remaining 20% (500 connections) is allocated for transaction messages from non-staked nodes. This allocation strategy mirrors priority lanes on highways, where drivers pay a toll to avoid traffic.

‍SWQoS has impacted the Solana ecosystem by raising the requirements to forward transactions to the leader and reducing the effectiveness of spam attacks. The change has incentivized high-traffic applications to vertically integrate their operations. By running their own validator nodes, or by having access to staked connections, applications can ensure privileged access to the leader, thereby enhancing their transaction processing capabilities.

# ‍A QUIC Note

‍In late 2022, Solana adopted the [QUIC networking protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC) to manage transaction message transmission to the leader. This transition was prompted by network disruptions caused by bots spamming on-chain NFT mints. QUIC facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication.

https://preview.redd.it/hqfeng0bpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6a7002fb6203d3e7535299c6a4340f55cc8927d

Initially developed by [Google](https://research.google/pubs/the-quic-transport-protocol-design-and-internet-scale-deployment/) in 2012, QUIC attempts to offer the best of both worlds. It facilitates rapid, asynchronous communication similar to UDP, but with the secure sessions and advanced flow control strategies of TCP. This allows for limits to be placed on individual sources of traffic so that the network can focus on processing genuine transactions. It also has a concept of separate streams; so if one transaction is dropped, it doesn’t need to block the remaining ones. In short, QUIC can be thought of as attempting to combine the best characteristics of TCP and UDP.

# ‍Callout box

*Stake-weighting is a recurring principle found throughout Solana's systems, encompassing voting rewards, turbine trees, leader schedules, Gulf Stream, and the gossip network. Validators with greater stake are accorded higher trust and prioritized roles in the network.*

# ‍Block Building

*“We consider SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) the best in terms of virtual machine technology currently.” — Andre Cronje, Fantom Foundation*

Many blockchain networks construct entire blocks before broadcasting them, known as discrete block building. Solana, in contrast, employs continuous block building which involves assembling and streaming blocks dynamically as they are created during an allocated time slot, significantly reducing latency.

‍Each slot lasts 400 milliseconds, and each leader is assigned four consecutive slots (1.6 seconds) before rotation to the next leader. For a block to gain acceptance, all transactions within it must be valid and reproducible by other nodes.

‍Two slots before assuming leadership, a validator halts transaction forwarding to prepare for its upcoming workload. During this interval, inbound traffic spikes, reaching over a gigabyte per second as the entire network directs packets to the incoming leader.

‍Upon receipt, transaction messages enter the Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), the validator's core logic responsible for block production. Here, the transaction processing sequence begins with the Fetch Stage, where transactions are received via QUIC. Subsequently, transactions progress to the SigVerify Stage, undergoing rigorous validation checks. Here the validator verifies the validity of signatures, checks for the correct number of signatures, and eliminates duplicate transactions.

https://preview.redd.it/tfq1r9pfpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07e829c1264f29fab5b9e1752ad2ec1048b3593

# Banking Stage

The banking stage can be described as the block-building stage. It is the most important stage of the TPU, which gets its name from the “bank“. A bank is just the state at a given block. For every block, Solana has a bank that is used to access state at that block. When a block becomes finalized after enough validators vote on it, they will flush account updates from the bank to disk, making them permanent. The final state of the chain is the result of all confirmed transactions. This state can always be recreated from the blockchain history deterministically.

‍Transactions are processed in parallel and packaged into ledger “entries,” which are batches of 64 non-conflicting transactions. Parallel transaction processing on Solana is made easy because each transaction must include a complete list of all the accounts it will read and write to. This design choice places a burden on developers but allows the validator to avoid race conditions by easily selecting only non-conflicting transactions for execution within each entry. Transactions conflict if they both attempt to write to the same account (two writes) or if one attempts to read from and the other writes to the same account (read + write). Thus conflicting transactions go into different entries and are executed sequentially, while non-conflicting transactions are executed in parallel.

‍There are six threads processing transactions in parallel, with four dedicated to normal transactions and two exclusively handling vote transactions which are integral to Solana’s consensus mechanism. All parallelization of processing is achieved through multiple CPU cores; validators have no GPU requirements ([docs](https://docs.solanalabs.com/operations/requirements)).

‍Once transactions have been grouped into entries, they are ready to be executed by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The accounts necessary for the transaction are locked; checks are run to confirm the transaction is recent but hasn’t already been processed. The accounts are loaded, and the transaction logic is executed, updating the account states. A hash of the entry will be sent to the Proof of History service to be recorded (more on this in the next section). If the recording process is successful, all changes will be committed to the bank, and the locks on each account placed in the first step are lifted. Execution is done by the SVM, a virtual machine built using the Solana fork of [rBPF](https://docs.rs/solana_rbpf/latest/solana_rbpf/), a library for working with JIT compilation, and virtual machines for eBPF programs. Note Solana does not mandate how validators choose to order transactions within a block. This flexibility is a crucial point that we will return to later in the Economics + Jito section of this report.

# ‍Remember

*The term SVM can be ambiguous, as it may refer to either the ""Solana Virtual Machine"" or the ""Sealevel Virtual Machine."" Both terms describe the same concept, with Sealevel being the name of Solana's runtime environment. The term SVM continues to be loosely thrown around despite recent efforts to precisely* [*define its boundaries*](https://www.anza.xyz/blog/anzas-new-svm-api)*.*

# ‍Clients

‍Solana is a network comprising thousands of independently operated nodes collaborating to maintain a single unified ledger. Each node constitutes a high-performance machine running the same open-source software known as a “client”.

‍Solana launched with a single validator client software — originally the Solana Labs client, now known as the [Agave client ](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave)— written in Rust. Expanding client diversity has been a priority ever since and one that will truly come to fruition with the launch of the [Firedancer client](https://www.helius.dev/blog/what-is-firedancer). Firedancer is a complete ground-up rewrite of the original client in the C programming language. Built by an experienced team from high-frequency trading firm Jump, it promises to be the most performant validator client on any blockchain.

# Proof of History

*“I had two coffees and a beer, and I was up until 4:00 AM. I had this eureka moment that puzzle \[sic\] similar to proof of work using the same SHA-256 preimage-resistant hash function… I knew that I had this arrow of time.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Proof of History (PoH) is Solana's secret sauce, functioning like a special clock in every validator that facilitates synchronization across the network. PoH establishes a reliable source of truth for the order of events and the passage of time. Most critically it ensures adherence to the leader schedule. Despite similar names, Proof of History is not a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work.

https://preview.redd.it/5m9vzdnppgbe1.png?width=1248&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b68f99530f62595829ba76bdf159cb127f2940

Communication overhead between nodes typically increases as networks expand, and coordination becomes increasingly complicated. Solana mitigates this by replacing node-to-node communication with a PoH local computation. This means validators can commit to a block with just a single round of voting. Trusted timestamps in messages ensure that validators cannot step over each other and start their blocks prematurely.

Underlying PoH are the unique properties of hashing algorithms, specifically [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2):

* **Deterministic:** The same input will always produce the same hash.
* **Fixed Size:** Regardless of input size, the output hash is always 256 bits.
* **Efficient:** It is fast to compute the hash for any given input.
* [**Preimage Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack)**:** Finding the original input from the hash output is computationally infeasible.
* **Avalanche Effect:** A small change in the input (even a single bit) results in a significantly different hash, a property known as the avalanche effect.
* [**Collision Resistance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_resistance)**:** It is infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash output.

Within each validator client, a dedicated ""Proof of History service"" continually runs the SHA256 hash algorithm creating a chain of hashes. Each hash’s input is the previous hash's output. This chain acts the same as a verifiable delay function, given that the hashing work must be done in sequence and the results of future hashes cannot be known ahead of time. If the PoH service creates a chain of a thousand hashes, we know time has passed for it to have calculated each hash sequentially — this can be thought of as a “micro proof of work.” Yet, other validators can verify the correctness of the thousand hashes in parallel at a much faster rate than they were produced since the input and output of each hash have been broadcast to the network. Therefore, PoH is difficult to produce but easy to verify.

The range of performance in computing SHA-256 across different CPUs is surprisingly narrow, with only small differences among the fastest machines. A common upper limit has already been reached, despite significant time and effort being invested in optimizing this function, largely due to Bitcoin's reliance on it.

During a leader’s slot, the PoH service will receive newly processed entries from the banking stage. The current PoH hash plus a hash of all transactions in the entry are combined into the next PoH hash. This serves as a timestamp that inserts the entry into the chain of hashes, proving the sequence in which transactions were processed. This process not only confirms the passage of time but also serves as a cryptographic record of the transactions.

In a single block, there are 800,000 hashes. The PoH stream also includes ""ticks,"" which are empty entries indicating the leader's liveness and the passage of time approximating a small fraction of a second. A tick occurs every 6.25 milliseconds, resulting in 64 ticks per block and a total block time of 400 milliseconds.

Validators continually run the PoH clock even when they are not the leader as it plays a pivotal role in the process of synchronization between nodes.

# Remember

*The key benefit of PoH is that it ensures the correct leader schedule must be adhered to, even if a block producer is offline — a state known as being “delinquent”. PoH prevents a malicious validator from producing blocks before their turn.*

# Accounts Model

*“Separating code and state in SVM was the best design decision. Blessed are the embedded system devs that religiously drilled this concept into my brain.” — Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana co-founder*

Within a Solana validator, the global state is maintained in the accounts database known as AccountsDB. This database is responsible for storing all accounts, both in memory and on disk. The primary data structure in the account index is a hashmap, making AccountsDB essentially a vast [key-value store](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key%E2%80%93value_database). Here, the key is the account address, and the value is the account data.

‍Over time the number of Solana accounts has surged into the hundreds of millions. This large number is partly because, as Solana developers are fond of saying, ""Everything on Solana is an account!""

https://preview.redd.it/od9jdizvpgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad934df81448f583fc49d29e7306cef5a4dc505

# Solana accounts

‍An account is a container that persistently holds data, similar to a file on a computer. They come in various forms:

‍User accounts: These accounts have a private key and are typically generated by a wallet software for a user.

* Data accounts: These accounts store state information, such as the number of a specific token a user holds.
* Program accounts: These are larger accounts that contain executable bytecode, somewhat equivalent to a .exe file on Windows or a .app file on Mac.
* Native program accounts: These are special pre-deployed program accounts that perform various core functionalities of the network. [Examples](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/programs) include the Vote Program and the BPF Loader.

‍All accounts have the following fields:

https://preview.redd.it/ek1vnit0qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c085da69525391de492cb3eb50db8d3fea40a330

# Programs

Solana program accounts contain only executable logic. This means when a program is run it mutates the state of other accounts but remains unchanged itself. This separation of code and state differentiates Solana from other blockchains and supports many of its optimizations. Developers primarily write these programs in Rust, a general-purpose programming language [known](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Final-ONCD-Technical-Report.pdf) for its strong focus on safety and performance. Additionally, multiple SDKs in [TypeScript](https://www.helius.dev/blog/build-solana-programs-with-typescript-poseidon) and Python are available to facilitate the creation of application front-ends and enable programmatic interaction with the network.

‍Many common functionalities are provided out-of-the-box by native programs. For example, Solana does not require developers to deploy code to create a token. Instead, instructions are sent to a pre-deployed native program that will set up an account to store the token’s metadata, effectively creating a new token.

# ‍Rent

‍Rent is a mechanism designed to incentivize users to close accounts and reduce state bloat. To create a new account, a minimum balance of SOL, known as the ""rent-exempt"" amount, must be held by the account. This can be considered a storage cost incurred to keep the account alive in a validator's memory. If the size of the account's data increases, the minimum balance rent requirement increases proportionally. When an account is no longer needed, it can be closed, and the rent is returned to the account owner. 

‍For example, if a user holds a dollar-denominated stablecoin, this state is stored in a token account. Currently, the rent-exempt amount for a token account is 0.002 SOL. If the user transfers their entire stablecoin balance to a friend, the token account can be closed, and the user will receive back their 0.002 SOL. Programs often handle account closures automatically for users. Several applications are available to help users clean up old, unused accounts and reclaim the small amounts of SOL stored in them.

# ‍Ownership

‍While reading account data is universally permitted, Solana's ownership model enhances security by restricting exactly who can modify (write) an account's data. This concept is crucial for enforcing rules and permissions on the Solana blockchain. Every account has a program ""owner"". The owner of an account is responsible for governing it, ensuring that only authorized programs can change the account's data. A notable exception to this rule is the transfer of lamports (the smallest unit of SOL)—increasing an account's lamports balance is universally permitted, regardless of ownership.

# ‍Storage of State

‍Solana programs, being read-only executable files, must store state using “Program Derived Addresses” (PDAs). PDAs are special types of accounts associated with and owned by a program rather than a specific user. While normal Solana user addresses are derived from the public key of an Ed25519 key pair, PDAs do not have a private key. Instead, their public key is derived from a combination of parameters—often keywords or other account addresses—along with the program ID (address) of the owning program.

‍PDA addresses exist ""off-curve,"" meaning they are not on the Ed25519 curve like normal addresses. Only the program that owns the PDA can programmatically generate signatures for it, ensuring that it’s the only one that can modify the PDA's state.

https://preview.redd.it/82dag167qgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5e5694b996bf17c3928282a7cf37dfb104b75e

Above: Solana token accounts are specific examples of Program Derived Addresses (PDAs). They are used to hold tokens and live “off-curve.” The Associated Token Account (ATA) program ensures that each wallet can only have one associated token account for each token type, providing a standardized way to manage token accounts.

# ‍Turbine

*“The most interesting part about Solana is not parallelization, the SVM, or Toly's tweets. It is something you probably haven't heard of: Turbine.” — Mert Mumtaz, Helius*

During the banking stage, transactions are organized into entries and sent to the Proof of History stream for timestamping. The block's bank is updated, and the entries are now ready for the next phase—Turbine.

Turbine is the process through which the leader propagates their block to the rest of the network. Inspired by [BitTorrent](https://www.bittorrent.com/), it is designed to be fast and efficient, reducing communication overhead and minimizing the amount of data a leader needs to send.

https://preview.redd.it/t9ijgbvaqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50c0ee8a717f6c145ad661e1855ec49a38917e9f

Turbine achieves this by breaking down transaction data into ""shreds'' through a process called ""shredding."" Shreds are small packets of data, up to 1280 bytes, similar to individual frames in a video stream. When reassembled, these shreds allow validators to replay the entire block. The shreds are sent over the internet between validators using UDP and utilize erasure coding to handle packet loss or malicious dropping of packets. [Erasure coding](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/realworld/reedsolomon/reed_solomon_codes.html#), a [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial)\-based error detection and correction scheme, ensures data integrity. Even if some shreds are lost, the block can still be reconstructed.

Shreds are grouped into batches known as forward error correction (FEC) batches. By default, these batches consist of 64 shreds (32 data shreds + 32 recovery shreds). Data recovery occurs per FEC batch, meaning that up to half the packets in a batch can be lost or corrupted, and all the data can still be recovered. Each 64 shred batch is merkelized with the root being signed by the leader, and chained to the previous batch. This process ensures that shreds can be securely obtained from any node in the network that possesses them, as the chain of Merkle roots provides a verifiable path of authenticity and integrity.

The leader initially broadcasts to a single root node, which disseminates the shreds to all other validator nodes. This root node changes with each shred. Validators are organized into layers, forming the ""Turbine Tree."" Validators with a larger stake amount are typically positioned toward the top of the tree, while those with lower stakes are placed toward the bottom.

https://preview.redd.it/3mflwjhcqgbe1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=50409eac7cb3e07884ed130f632c95b3590541ba

The tree usually spans two or three hops, depending on the number of active validators. For visual simplicity, a fanout of 3 is depicted above, but Solana’s actual fanout value is currently set to 200. For security reasons, the order of the tree is rotated for each new batch of shreds.

The primary goal of such a system is to alleviate the outbound data egress pressure on the leader and root nodes. By utilizing a system of transmit and retransmit, the load is distributed between the leader and the retransmitters, reducing the strain on any single node.

# Consensus

*“Some smart people tell me there is an earnest smart developer community in Solana… I hope the community gets its fair chance to thrive” — Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum co-founder*

Once a validator receives a new block from the leader via Turbine, it must validate all transactions within each entry. This involves replaying the entire block, validating the PoH hashes in parallel, recreating the transactions in the sequence dictated by PoH, and updating its local bank. 

[**https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png**](https://i.postimg.cc/brW7PxG6/image.png)

This process is handled by the Transaction Validation Unit (TVU), which is analogous to the leader’s Transaction Processing Unit (TPU), serving as the core logic responsible for processing shreds and block validation. Like the TPU, the TVU flow is broken down into several stages, starting with the Shred Fetch Stage where shreds are received over Turbine. In the subsequent Shred Verify Leader Signature Stage, the shreds undergo multiple sanity checks, most notably the verification of the leader’s signature, which ensures that the received shreds originated from the leader. 

‍In the Retransmit Stage, the validator, based on its location in the Turbine tree, forwards the shreds to the appropriate downstream validators. In the Replay Stage, the validator recreates each transaction exactly and in the correct order while updating its local version of the bank.

‍The Replay Stage is analogous to the banking stage in the TPU; it is the most important stage and can be more directly described as the block validation stage. Replay is a single-threaded process loop that orchestrates many key operations, including voting, resetting the PoH clock, and switching banks.

Diagnosed with Schizoaffective-Bipolar, and put on disability this year. ","My story started when I was 16 in 2013, and that year, two of my best High School friends passed away. One by a car accident, and then a close friend of mine committed suicide in grief concerning our friend dying, leaving in his Instagram bio for the rest of time to read, ""I'll see you one day, buddy""

Before my friend passed away, we went on a summer vacation with friends to another friend's house to stay over a weekend. We got in a huge fight, and we had a major falling out. I didn't talk to him before he died. 

The last time I saw my best friend, who I had homeroom class with every day, was at my friend's funeral. 

Then, before that, he was expelled from school for becoming behaviorally reckless and bringing a bottle of alcohol to school to drink through the day. Right before he was caught and arrested at school. He saw me in his last class of homeroom, where he tried to get me to take the bottle from him ""because they were onto him."" 

I said no because I didn't want to get in trouble myself. I could've easily taken that bottle and stashed it or trashed it somewhere from my book bag, and he would've possibly never gotten caught with it. He was acting a fool, and his breath reeked. I still second-guess this.

When I turned 17 in 2014, my Senior year of High School. A girl met me, and it was love at first sight. The week I met her, I experienced what the Doctor at the Hospital called a ""First break, prodromal psychosis"". 

During my first ""episode,"" I experienced my first Command Hallucination phrases from auditory hallucinations and delusions. 

In my new homeroom class, after being transferred from my friend passing away. Meeting all new people that year after - I met this girl over the weekend at a school soccer game. She was very shy the last time we met. She approached me without saying a word, outlined my stenciled ""Stussy"" shirt, and asked what it meant. She was very coy, didn't say a word to me, blushed, smiled like a child, and ran off laughing like a kid. 

The people I sat with were talking about meeting her at a party over the same weekend that I met her at a soccer game. 

They were talking about taking advantage of her and trying to get her drunk so they could ""Bring her to the back room and hook up with her."" I jumped out of my skin emotionally and lashed out verbally. Attempting to fight one of my classmates, 

These were the group and type of kids that my group and type of people hated morally, and we rivaled. One of my other best friends, and best friends with my now-dead friend. Kicked in this guy's car door because they came by his house to punk on him. The same guy, the owner of the house party, and his girlfriend cheated on him with me at age 15 because she said she hated him. We were considered ""Rat or trashy"" by this other ""In-group,"" and she was just meeting these people for the first time that night. I was attempting to protect her from these awful people, and that's simply what I was trying to do: save my love for her and me. 

Also, the same guy that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out with years later making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend saying that he should be dead. 

For some reason or the other. I had the rationale of believing that the girl that I met was endangered by these people after this incident that day in her classes, and I became concerned. Becoming so delusional that I left one of my classes to search for her in random classrooms. 

I landed on a teacher who told me in the past, a year before after my friend's death. ""If I ever had an emergency, you can come to my classroom. I can take all the students out of the class. I can help you."" So this happened, and we called my parents. My parents were on the way from work to pick me up because I started to become concerned for my mental health. They were going to take me to the hospital. - During this encounter, the school police were involved and began questioning me when in the room after the call. I started to become paranoid, thinking I was under arrest and going to jail. I started to become delusional and verbally violent with the officer in disrespect without reason. The police officer ran at me, tackled me onto the floor, and arrested me. 

I screamed for my life Bloody Mary, and every single surrounding classroom heard me. Students came to the door, trying to get into it to save me. 

I got expelled from school for ""Fighting a police officer"" and resisting arrest, when never under any crime committed to arrest me. Only able to come back on medical waiver from the hospital, and on thin ice. 

\-

When I arrived at the hospital, my first grandiose delusion was the Shutter Island theme. I fought with the nurses on admittance and became hostile because I was delusional and thought they were lying to my parents to separate me from them. 

They held me down in an 8-point procedure and briefly held a plastic bag to prevent me from spitting on them. They injected Ativan into my IV, and my vision faded from colored vision to black, like turning off an old-school television. 

\-

Coming back to High School a week later, experienced the daydream nightmare of the immaturity of teens in High Schools. like me, Dorthy of bullying, dealing with hazing, two-faced liars intentionally stigmatizing and creating mis-socialization-ally drama to misinform others about my false identity reputation. Marginalizing my life without chance or opportunity to show worthiness or growth. Stunting my whole lifeline, 

Also, the day terror of sitting in front of all the people had just experienced everything that happened the week before during class; like it didn't happen. 

Whipped cream on top was going to a soccer game the next weekend. To watch the girl that fell in love with me at first sight. Walking up to her while she was sitting alone in the stands, attempting to sit around near her to start a conversation about what happened so I could explain it. She stood up and ran off without a word right as I sat down and said, ""Hey,""

The cherry on top was during my psychosis. I had the delusion that one of my friends at the lunch table across from me during my episode was texting this girl, I grabbed his phone out of his hand. He said ""She's not in my contacts,"" I scrolled down his list, and found her in his phone book. I got her # out of it, and - then started to text her over the next month. 

She started to reply, and I would text her every morning before school - like my dead best friend had taught me to do with girls. To wake them up with a smile every day, ... So I would text her ""Good morning"" and even do it normally without a reply. At one point after this, I asked her if she liked me, and she said, ""Yes."" 

Over time, after this. I don't remember what happened because she just randomly stopped replying out of the blue one day. I still haven't talked to her in person, a whole conversation. Just a simple, Hello, Goodbye.

After graduating High School in 2015, we followed each other on Instagram for 2 years. I got the Follwers+ app, and it showed my insights, her being my #1 liked on all photos. 

I had not yet said anything about my Hospitalization up to this point and kept my experiences to myself with my trauma. Going to therapy and trying to resolve it. Unsuccessful, grieving the reality that would come if I became vulnerable to her when telling her the truth of my visit. 

I saw her from time to time when I would go out and get something to eat. One time, when she was working at a Hostess job, she waved at me, and I put my head down in my hat and walked past her through the door. I saw her at a friend of friends, a foreign exchange student party. I guarded her in basketball and made her laugh, bouncing goofy on a trampoline. I saw her at two graduation parties, and we played volleyball together on a team. We also had an exclusive night, where all my old High School friends played soccer 5-5, where she showed up. I picked her to be on my team in line up, as captain. Also scored on her nutmeg, while the goalie ran around with my shirt over my head. Victorious, her guy friend we played soccer with that night was good friends with me and took her to prom, and told me ""She was happy to see me that night""

In this era of my life, I was delusional. Dropped out of school due to trauma and paranoia. To start selling marijuana by the pound, to escape my judgmental Hometown. I planned to run away to Europe and become homeless & nameless. Sleeping on Euro-Star trains nightly traversing the country's borderlines, moving around enough to never been seen. My wish. 

Robbed at gunpoint, during a deal that went South one night over 3/4 a pound of weed. 

\-

In 2016 moved on to a new girl, about a year after this. Meeting someone new online. She liked my photos on Instagram and was from my old High School. She followed me, and I DM'd her. We started to talk for a week,

Sympathizing toward her Dad's Stage 3-Terminal Lung Cancer, we began to bond over her struggle empowering her strength. 

My at-the-time best friend, from High School. Knew this girl, and when I told him I was talking to her - He looked at me like he had seen a ghost, and didn't say a word as the hair on my arms stood up in the deafening stare of silence. 

He said ""I shouldn't be talking to her,"" and wouldn't explain why. I thought it was because he was family friends, with their family. It didn't make sense to me at the time a very big head-scratcher. 

Over the next few days, I was messaging her still and she became less and less frequent in replies reply text emotions, and length. I thought she was depressed because of her Father, the last messages I remember sending her were ""You are strong""

The next day, after waking up and realizing I was out of the blue, blocked. I received a random text message from an old High School classmate I used to sell weed to. He had made up some whole elaborate scheme, of a lie of a story. Saying that him, and this girl that I was talking to - for a whole week. ""Had a boyfriend, and I'm her boyfriend. You need to stop talking to her, she doesn't want you talking to her. Me bothering her, and creeping on her."" 

This conversation delineated and descended into madness. I rivaled him, knowing this wasn't the truth. Having zero photos on her Instagram of him, or even mentioning him once during the week she contacted me. He ended up telling me to ""Go hang myself"", and I figured out it wasn't the truth. The last message I read from him, was before putting my phone down and started calling people for days to find out where he lived.

Even worse, after this. I decided to further my investigation, of what was going on with my reputation that I didn't know about wasn't my idea of my own life, but others' disrespectful perception. 

I took to Instagram, to air out the dirty laundry of the conversation between me and the guy that texted me. Losing 500 followers in 2 days. I messaged the best friend of the girl who had just blocked me. She was my older brothers, Ex-girlfriends' younger sister. I thought I could trust her enough, having conversations with her in the past. She told me that ""in 1-2 years, her best friend who blocked me would be coming out as lesbian, and that she was unsure about her sexual emotions towards men, and me"".  - I believed it, and this was a 2-year long lie. That I believed. 

\-

After this lie was told to me in 2017, I thought that we all were literally ""Best friends forever"" because she just told me her best friend's deepest, darkest secret.

This also led me into delusional thinking and thought that since now these girls were friends with me, she was a lesbian. I could move on to a new girl, or what I poorly decided to do looking back. I went back to the first girl - her being friends with these girls. That I thought I had a second chance, her being a lesbian. I had feelings for in High School that I met at the Soccer Game, that I had my episode over. 

This fooled me into delusional thinking that these people were my friends. Literally, 

I made a Twitter account. Because I thought I was popular, and started following all of these people that lied to me because I wanted to speak on the topic over social media, so I could follow my friends and clear the air, to get my reputation back. 

I followed and messaged the first girl I met in High School at the soccer game, trying to rekindle our relationship. I thought we were friends now, us all being in on the know-how. 

I started to Tweet, but this is when my first manic/depressive episode happened. Back when Twitter was 140 characters, I tweeted 500 tweets. Opening up about the Hospital, because I felt comfortable about my new ""friends"" accepting me, and I wanted my whole community to know about this story now. Us being friends and feeling wanted and belong. 

The girl from High School got a No-Contact, Restraining order against me. 

She didn't even read a single one of the Tweets I sent, and just saw her name mentioned and filed it. Because now this was technically ""harassment and cyber-stalking"" 

\-

I still was fully under the delusional misinformed perception, that this other girl was fully a lesbian, and was coming out in College in 1-2 years. After he Father passed away, she had time to heal. 

I tried to express this story to my old friends, over social media. That had now ghosted me, unfollowed me, and blocked my number. 

I didn't know what was going on, I was in the dark for 2 years. No one, not a single person. No old ""friend"" decided to tell me anything about it - likely such a well-hidden secret targeting character assassination that all these other people my old friends hung out with. Lied to them. To rid me, 

I sat on Social Media over Twitter for 2 whole years, with 0 followers, tweeting my life and heart out away trying to make up for the past and be forgiven. Through reconciliation, and went to church weekly for the whole time. Thinking that Jesus had ""Blessed Me"" - Waiting 2 years for this girl to, never come out. 

1 year of realization of this lie, and no friends later. I attempted a suicide mission, to talk to the girl from High School at the soccer game. On the address where it was put on the restraining order to stay away from. 

I got arrested after showing up to her College dormitory campus, of 40,000 people. Twice, two days in a row. Searching for her name on the dorm doors. I was going to knock on her door, and wished she was inside to speak to her. It was my dying wish almost looking back. 8 years ago 

I went to Jail for 9 days, only. Thinking it would be more severe ""Stalking"" charges which, I literally Googled and researched before because that's what I wanted to catch, to keep myself in jail long enough to be killed by an inmate. 

My parents could've bailed me out on day two but hung up on me over the phone in a screaming match while staring at inmates who wanted to kill me over my charges. 

I went to the Hospital for two weeks after this and was misdiagnosed as bipolar. 

\-

I went to therapy monthly, which was mandatory for my plea deal while on probation back in 2017-18. With the same therapist for one whole year. Talking about this story, and about how she was a ""Lesbian"" and I hung out with one friend in this entire timeline of my probation of two years. 

The night I hung out with my one friend from High School, an old best friend, it was for one hour. His girlfriend at the time went to the College I showed up at. He harassed me deceptively in front of my face to hang out with me to ""Figure out what's going on in my life,"" my guess, and poked around making fun of my life, all while calling me a friend. 

At one point making up a game, and scenario, where we would ""Imagine our future lives;"" He started to get sinister, and said ""I could see you being physically abusive towards your future wife, and just lightly slapping her around""... it got dark for no reason in particular. I didn't even say what I thought his life would be, or look like. I didn't get it, and couldn't believe he went all that way just to make it like that. In awe to this date, appalled, 

He got cancer 2 years later, and didn't let me visit him once while it was happening, 

I had received a \*67 Caller ID prank call, with a girl disguising her voice as a man. I heard snickering and laughter from boys and girls in the background. They had asked me ""Did you get laid by that one girl at the cul-de-sac party?"", Putting the idea later together in time ""The Block Party""   .... Up to this point in my life I haven't talked to a girl in 5 years. 

I started to make over-the-phone death threats, and then, over the internet on Social Media on Twitter, I had a mental breakdown where I name-called and put death threats on my social media to people I thought had my number and were messing with me. 

The police were called, and I got in trouble by them filing a report! They interrogated me in front of my parents, and I told them what was going on with me. They believed me, but told me to not go about doing it that way, ... I was just triggered and exploded in rage. 

I kept up the Twitter, unknowing of the idea that she wasn't lesbian, or not being real. Trying to communicate with the first girl with the restraining order, to reconcile forgiveness. Attempting to persuade her to love me again, and negotiate a deal between us to have happiness because it wasn't me, but my mental illness. 

Speaking to no one about it, and thinking that I shouldn't come out with her lesbian secret because he Father passed away from Lung Cancer now. 

I met an old High School friend I used to sell weed to at a gas station one night, ironically enough. His girlfriend at the time who was with him, was best friends with the girl who had the restraining order on me. He came up to me in line, behind me, and stuck out his hand to handshake, and say ""What's up"", like nothing happened. 

I messaged him on Snapchat, and he filled me in on a major truthful update. He said that the girl I thought was a lesbian; wasn't. The girl with the restraining order was getting a second one, and she was also ""Happier without me""

Coming shortly later to find a couple months later, on her newly created Facebook. She was dating the guy who was the host of the party back in High School, best friends with one of the guys who tried to take advantage of her in High School. The guy that his girlfriend in High School Freshman year cheated on me because she hated him. The guy that got his car door kicked in by my best friend, and my now dead best friend. Also, the same guy that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out with years later making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend saying that he should be dead. Also found out she joined a sorority and started to become egotistically classy. 

She had also stated that I was ""Visionless, and controlling"" and, I needed ""to be happy, to be in a relationship""

\- 

I became suicidal again in 2019, but was hospitalized after writing a suicide note and put on medicine shortly after dropping out of college for the third time due to being symptomatic from stress. 

I went to therapy for years after this, and after being discharged by my last therapist for ""inability to treat client, needs a higher level of treatment"" I bounced around from therapist to therapist. 

One time being called a stalker, and then by another an ""Incel"" 

My parents started to fight so much over the last years, with this idea and with me. Talking of divorce, and fighting screaming at each other in death matches with me.  My Mother stated to me out loud once in a fight over this topic where she chose their side for years against me. ""I don't know who you are anymore!""

Getting in a fistfight with my Father where I knocked him out unconscious when he told me ""I'm glad I kept you in jail for longer and didn't bail you out""

My brother abandoned me. Not talking to me for whole years. Disliking me If we already didn't get along before enough a verbal fight with him one night brought out the idea, and words that I was a ""Fuck up"" 

\-

In 2020, I had another hospitalization, this one being my fourth and fifth. 

I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective-Bipolar. Originally, just diagnosed bipolar but it was a misdiagnosis. Unmedicated improperly for 4 whole years. In and out of psychosis, delusions, hallucinations.

I had contacted the friend that met me at the gas station, that I used to sell weed to back in High School. He said that he can talk to her about it, and we talked back and forth for about a week. 

He said that she said ""It had been so long since we met, and everything including us has changed. We weren't the same anymore, and that we didn't have the same alignment that we used to have growing up.

That sunk me like a rock to the bottom, and I was told that she was moving states. 8 hours away. 

4 years had passed on the restraining orders, and restraining orders only last 2 years til you have to decide if you need to refile. Or it becomes permanent if necessary. 

She didn't renew the restraining orders. When she had enough evidence to. 

Months later, I kept tallies of her Instagram over the years. Dreaming of being unblocked and happy together once again. I kept tallies on her friend's Instagram's too, to check to see if she's in the photos; or if they leave me little coded messages like they used to back in the restraining order to communicate how they felt towards me with what I was saying.  

I found one day on her best friends Instagram, saying ""You're not alone"", ""I set you free for freedom's sake :)!, Never give up, there is always brighter days around the corner."" 

I deleted my Instagram, in rage and realization of a reversal in loss of time. I took it more than personally. 

I was frustrated with life. 

\-

During the next two years 2021, & 2022,

I took medicine, and looked around for jobs. Couldn't find therapy. One friend at the time, and he then suddenly passed away on his birthday night I took him to the bars to drink. 

He co-piloted me that night, and wing-manned me because he knew about my story. I grew up being diagnosed with abandonment issues, trust issues, and avoidant personality disorder.  

I had met a girl, with him. He let us be, and I got her number that night. Took him home and talked all about it, smoked a blunt before he went inside for the last time. Talked about music, and how art needs to be relevant,. 

He left his lighter in my car that night on accident, and in the morning when I figured out he passed away. I found his lighter that reads ""Going Nowhere Fast""

He smoked about two packs a day and worked 80+ weeks, he passed away from a widow-maker heart attack. Age 25. Apparently had an undiagnosed murmur.  The military never spotted it in his service. 

I worked around at my Dad's janitor's office for $3,600 a year. Couldn't get any jobs anywhere; not even Walmart with my misdemeanor ""Invasion of privacy"" charges. I wouldn't even get calls back after two interviews, and companies would flat out ignore me like I was obsolete.  

I worked terrible, under-the-table jobs where I would make cash and often times manipulated out of money.

Quitting wear house jobs on the spot multiple times because I was unable to keep up with demands. 

\-

2023, & 

I was talking to a doctoral-level psychologist, who was also a therapist. She was a trauma care specialist, and she also specialized in intellectual disability to name a few. She is no longer my therapist. She had me sign up for an Autism Screening Test, which I never ended up taking. 

Before she dropped me as her patient.. she said after jail & the hospital ""I was trying to have a relationship with her"" 



?



In 2019 when I went to the psych ward at Methodist after a voluntary commitment for suicidal ideation, I got evaluated for a week for Autism. 

The same dual doctorate resident who told me that she thought I was on the spectrum sat me down, and told me she wanted to take me out of the ward after the week's evaluation and take me to ""meet the other people just like me, to get to know myself better"". I told her ""No, I don't want to go"" because I had been there for 3 weeks and it was a day before my birthday that I got discharged, and told. 

I had an unmedicated delusion. Where I stopped taking medicine from when I started in 2021-2023 after my diagnosis.

I bought that same first girl that forgave me and had restraining orders on me a Tiffany Charm Clasp Bracelet for $1,500 off my parent's credit card, because I thought they were Satanists, and wanted to make it up to her and piss them off for messing up my life abusing me emotionally.  

I got into a delusional fight about thinking my parents were living a double life as Free Masonic demonic worshipers. Which wasn't even close to the truth, just found an old Free Mason book on our bookshelf from 2000, where my Dad attended an introductory meeting with his friend when he was trying to sell him insurance. 

  
I told my Father priest about this on the day of The Feast of Guardian Angels, and while my parents were out of town on vacation when I went into madness.

My priest gave me a holy water bottle blessed to smite Satan. With the book wrapped in a towel after touching it, reading 5 pages then, slamming it shut. An Angel appeared and took the book in the image. because I vacated my house thinking it was cursed terrified. He told me to douse the house with holy water to sleep & shower plus eat.

I got detained by my local police for disturbing the peace when getting into an argument with my parents, my Dad called the cops on me. At my house after they got home.

I was taken to the local hospital, by a police officer that heard out my story & gave me $100.

I took an Uber with the money he gave me after I got dropped off at the ER. Waiting for Secure Holding. The wait was 6 hours.

I went to my therapist's office in crisis and instead decided to go to the ER up there for me to try and get sleep medication because I hadn't rested in a week.

The medical staff at the hospital said they couldn't help me, or prescribe me any medicine. They instead diagnosed with me Anxiety Disorder and then discharged me from the ER at 4 am in 25 minutes. When it was 20 degrees outside, telling them I had nowhere to go; homeless. Other people were sleeping on the chairs in covers. (probably homeless too)

The Resource Security Officer started to threaten me. I started to argue with him, and I walked out.

For some reason -- My delusions, and hallucinations took hold of me spiritually. I was enraged by my self-evident situational outcome.

I filled up the Holy Water vial with water and marched up into the ER. Threw the water on the officer's face that kicked me out, and ran out. Getting away. Dropping my phone in the process,

I walked about a mile on the premises, into a building where I thought I was secure to catch my breath from running.

The police stormed in, and arrested me saying ""Hand's on Officer, Officer down"". Portraying that I assaulted the man physically with my body.

When I saw the Officer again he had red all over his face, I don't know what caused that. Maybe analgesic reaction

They took me to the County Jail, where I was put into Cell Block C, with accused charges to be arraigned of Felony Battery

I was met quickly with inmates checking me. I was punked being my size, and weight. Being in jail before, I knew this wouldn't be an easy trip.

Entering at exactly 7:07 am the Officer checked when held for 20 minutes at the gates, with my confirmation Saint Maximillion statue in my possession in my book bag that they detained me with.

I was getting out alive determined.

Not understand that the complex only allowed one five-minute call per inmate each week without pay. Having no money in my account, calling my parents to let them know, before being cut off unknowingly mid-conversation. 

A despot inmate, after me sneezing once from likely dust being in the facility; Accused me of having COVID-19, and started a fight that began with him charging at me to pull me off the 6ft top double bunk I was lying in.

I jumped off, scared from the drop. Him all in my personal space and area. Tried to chase him out of my bunk, to then be knocked out. I sprung back up, after hitting the back of my head on a metal bench seat.

An inmate behind me picked me up and led me back to my bed. Where I passed out for hours. 

Awoke in the middle of chaos, to have to defend myself from the guards never noticing on the camera.

The place was wild, with people smoking weed & spice in the showers. Passing lines of Coke through the neighboring cell block doors.

People coming in, and multiple people being jumped were being witnessed. Where these killers left other inmates bathed in blood and tears from head to toe.

I hid amongst the Fear of God with the other prayer group of inmates reading Bible study in the block. With rife Hell Raising gang members telling me now ""Don't press charges against him"", thinking this was the only way out of the block.

Being told ""I was lucky because they stomped someone to death in this cell block here two weeks ago""

Now knowing from other inmates if I went into the medical or the suicide room. I could save myself.

Talking to one of the guards about in the morning to check back on the cameras, honestly trying to get out alive with my life.

Going to medical to be evaluated for my wounds after being forced by a gang leader to leave the block or else, after realizing staying in the block wasn't my best bet.

They transferred me and put me into cold isolation, given food with no utensils. No toilet paper, for half the day.

Officers came to my cell, after my claims in medical. Stated that I charged after him, and the person trying to hurt me wasn't trying to hurt me ""On their million-dollar camera system"", now me being the assailant when I never touched anyone. Knocked unconscious, apparently ""I was never knocked out"", since I got up so quickly.

Then they tried to mitigate the situation by trying to force me to sign papers saying that I wasn't going to press charges on him when I was now being arraigned on more different charges, going to trial now for two cases. In jail.

In the meantime, while waiting, arraigned by the magistrate. I got my other charges lowered to A & B misdemeanors with a $500 bond.

Being moved into another block after medical & isolation, waiting until further notice. Realizing I was now transferred to the Sex Offender's block, behind two locked steel doors.

I was unable to call my parents, and now also I do not know my account login & password. The inmates in the other cell block stole my paperwork, hacked my account, and took the other $40 in my possession that the first officer gave me out of my wallet into their commissary for coffee.

I was unable to manage to get an officer to help me for days, obviously ignored intentionally. Buzzing on the intercom for hours throughout the day to help me log into my account to make one final call.

Being only told over the intercom, that I was being moved back into the same cell block that I started in.

I lucked out, and they had to sanitize the whole block head to toe because somebody complained about lice being found in their bunk. Shaving our heads off, and making us shower naked in front of them to make sure no spread.

I managed to convince an inmate into giving me a free 5-minute call, off his account. After two days. Telling me ""Never give up,"" after ringing me up a call.

My parents picked up, and I tried to calmly explain my situation. It ended in them telling me ""We'll be there to pick you up in the morning, we're going to bed."" Hung up on.

I hadn't slept in 4 days straight, on top of the week in psychosis before. I wasn't eating food, only water fasting with Kool-Aide sugar packet water because the food was inedible.

In the morning, before breakfast is served. I got my call to be arraigned on my second-coming charges, and then I was supposed to be moved back.

Walking in the hallway, and into the elevators.

Passing another Officer, that had my RO (Release Out) paperwork. Noticed my face, and said ""Is this ""....., ....... ?"". The officer handling me was surprised feet away from the courtroom.

Walked me in, and asked the Judge if I was ""Free to go?"", and the Judge nodded.

""He's free to go.""

I also got my first charge dropped after two months out of jail, and I pleaded insanity.

\-

During my 3 1/2 week hospital visit, after jail. Where I fought verbally and emotionally with the Head Doctor this time, over my ""Austim misdiagnosis"" 

I made a ""friendship bracelet"" that said the girl's name that I fell in love with back in High School, and the same one that got a restraining order on me. It was for a memories sake because I was losing track of time 

Meeting a lady there for two weeks, and on her last two days before getting discharged. She told me that she was diagnosed with Pulmonary Lung Cancer, 

Another patient told me that he was going to kill himself, and I made friends with him. He had just been released from prison and moved here. He was depressed, and shot himself in the mouth; a bullet ricocheted into his skull. Making him eyeless in one eye, and not killing him.  

During my inpatient stay, I was notified that my charges from 2017 were expunged.

This year, 2024.

My Grandfather had been battling a five-year-long battle with his health in decline because of Alzheimer's'. Passing away this year. 

My Dad got really abusive drunk one night, saw that I spent $200 at a museum gift shop in a manic episode, 

I came home and me and him got into a fight where he attempted to choke me, and grabbed me by the throat. The neighbors heard us fighting the whole night, and weirdly enough; right as my Dad grabbed my throat. The doorbell rang simultaneously, and a police officer heard me scream ""HELP"" My dad grabbing my neck, and my Mom tried to break us apart. 

Police officer waving red beam dot in my face and all across my whole family chest, 

Right after the police kicked in my Childhood home door 

I had an NDE where I tried to take my own life. I drove at 100mph and crashed into a tree line on purpose, totaled my car, and salvaged it. I didn't have a seat belt on, and my kneecaps went under the steering wheel, coming out walking on my own with just getting two stitches to my right eye. 

I received a DUI that night but was only taken to the hospital because I was only high and not drunk, they took my blood level and found six months later that I had marijuana in my bloodstream. They let me go that night without arresting me. 

I received an EEG where it was for my ""Autism misdiagnosis"", and confirmed that I was still schizoaffective bipolar. 40x higher more sensitivity than the regular human to anxiety. OCD, 

Also, a life-changing diagnosis. Amnestic Disorder. Or, Hereditary, Short-Term Memory Loss. I still don't know if it's from my parents, lack of therapeutic level of medicine in my bloodstream, or when I got knocked out when ganged up on while in jail. 

6 months later, at the start of the month. On the 2nd, I was issued my charges for my arrest for my DUI, but then the next day, I had two warrants for my arrest. 

I had been in communication with the local Crisis Intervention team at my local county police department after I was arrested, and trying to explain to her it was me trying to take my life. They sympathized and talked to the prosecutor, who talked to the judge who had my bail posted before being arrested and jailed.  So I wouldn't have to sit in jail for 24 hours until seeing a judge, getting my bail posted, and then being bailed out. 

I went over to the persons parents house that came to my dead best friends funeral. Talked to his Mom, scolding her about showing up to my dead best friend's funeral and paying disrespect. She didn't know this.  

After this, one of my brother's older friends, who is 31 years old followed me on Instagram, making fun of me in the past for loving that one girl who got the restraining orders on me. Started to poke fun at me, and thought it was funny to follow me. While over at a cousin's Christmas, 

I had a episode and messaged him that I was going to hurt him. He sent it to my parents, while we were together at cousin's Christmas, and this made me so mad I exploded on him and we got in a big fight. He messaged my parents again what I said to him, and all hell broke loose. 

Telling me ""You're not disabled, I grew up with your brother"", when I hadn't seen him in 10 years. 

Also that ""I have no redeemable qualities"", posting my arrest article, and did a background check on some weird website where it showed my whole expunged arrest record, trying to make fun of me. 

I had also then sent the messages to my 31 year old brother who, didn't back me up, and said ""It's all your doing, don't look at me"" 

I had posted about my most recent suicide attempt online to my social media talking about it being alive surviving it, and the girl with the restraining order noticed. I posted about receiving the diagnosis of Short Term Memory Loss, and ironically enough. Her college's sorority's main donation focus is Memory loss, with Dementia & Alzheimer's. Have raised and donated more than $9 million to the Alzheimer’s Association.

Her best friend, whom I've been communicating with through 

Blocked me last night, or this morning. When I woke up to that this morning. I felt like I was in a good place, and had been talking to her for the last 3 months, but it was superficial because I was just talking to her, through tagging her in my photo’s and directly @ her.

One-sided, never a response other than, I guess my entangled telepathic intercession. The girl with the restraining order she had never responded once, but since then 3 months ago, she had stopped following, and letting people follow her. 

Other than that, it was day & night for her with meeting new people each weekend even worse. 

Something I talked about to her, and said. It was destroying my faith, and one of the many reasons I attempted suicide.

Like she was just searching for the thrill of it, and never giving me and chance or opportunity to show my real self to her since we hadn’t talked since we met in High School before my first episode. Another point we talked about. 

Her friend in the past had over the internet on her instagram, said many meaningful things to me, but nothing no more now. 

Then she randomly blocked me today, so I have no idea why. 

On the 3rd, of January. I believe it was because she was annoyed, because I was following her day, and night to notify her of my love for her. 

At times for months she would not reject my follow-up requests, but after the fight with that one person who mocked me. She started to decline them. I believe I am done physically with this situation over social media, as there is nothing more attached other than what was in the past. ",1,1736214072.0,disability,0,1.0,False

[acne],"i've struggled with cystic hormonal acne regularly every month since i was about 20 (now im 24). only around my mouth. i had started replacing my morning coffee with a large spearmint tea (3 bags of the Handpick brand, it's amazon's choice) and it basically eradicated my acne and got me to a point where the scars had begun fading.

i stopped taking it for 2 weeks this past summer and the acne has been back ever since. i've been taking 3 capsules of the Swanson full spectrum spearmint capsules daily and they seem to help somewhat, but i still have recurring pimples. im confused because i had seen many people claiming the capsule form was more effective than the tea for them and im wondering if there's any concrete evidence to support that? i figured the capsules would be more convenient but did some research and apparently in tea form the compounds in the herbs are more easily absorbed into the bloodstream. so maybe it's more effective to drink it in tea form after all? has anyone had this experience?

I have a couple other questions as well:

1. is there is a best time to take it? personally i haven't been able to notice whether or not it makes a difference when i take it in the morning/ night or taking half a dose in the morning and half at night
2. how many mg do you suggest taking? right now i take three 400mg capsules so 1200mg daily. is this not enough or too much? i read that I should be only taking 900mg
3. is spearmint just a topical solution to a deeper problem? does it lose effectiveness over time or will I develop a tolerance? i eat healthy, stay hydrated, workout, wash my face and moisturize daily so I know for sure that the acne is hormonal, and I really don't want to go on birth control to manage it :/ i don't want to open up a new can of worms and i already have a nonhormonal iud",2,1736213885.0,SkincareAddicts,0,1.0,False

1hvfx3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1hvfx3z/haul_reviews_cocoapink_more/,Haul Reviews: CocoaPink & More!,"Hello, IMAM! Through their very early Black Friday sale, I ordered from a longtime favorite house, [CocoaPink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1hbitcz/my_cocoapink_package_arrived/). Then, for actual Black Friday, I made quite the impulsive decision to FS two fragrances from [Birch & Besom](https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1hgpx6h/my_birch_and_besom_order_arrived/), and get samples of the other colder-weather scents I’d wanted to try as well (because those two fragrances were seriously instant favorites, it’s a bit ludicrous).

I’ll be reviewing both orders here.

It’s important to note that, while I initially chose the fragrances based on notes, I make a point of not double-checking when I test, going in as blindly as possible. Now, on to the reviews!

**CocoaPink**

“It’s Only Magic” (body butter) – *Lashings of sugary vanilla, magical herbs, dried sage, ritual incense, Bulgarian lavender, musk, and a chilling ocean breeze.*

I bit the bullet and tried the body butter sample first—and I say “bit the bullet” because it initially smelled very sweet (almost like cake batter), and I was hoping it wouldn’t turn cloying. Once on the skin, however… deep herbs and even a little smokiness rose above the sugar and made everything smell far more “witchy” (this is one of the Halloween Movie Night fragrances, associated with *The Craft*). There is one note that brings an astringency—or, at least, that’s how I detect it because I hate sage (I’m not a demon, I promise). But altogether, this is a fun body butter/lotion scent given the depth it provides.

Looking at the scent list now, though, I can say that I get absolutely no ocean breeze. In terms of California landscapes, I think this smells far more like Joshua Tree National Park than Venice Beach.

Rating: **4**/5 – Invocation of the Spirit

“Corvo” – *A warm, deep, and mysterious fragrance, with the lightest veil of magical smoke. Pink peppercorns, Orange Flower, Chestnuts, Peru Balsam EO, Guaiacwood EO, Vanilla Bean, Cashmeran & Cade Oil.*

Not sure why, but I decided to start my testing with the freebies. First, it was the little body butter sample; then, the 1mL sample vial (where I am *extra* careful not to smear the black ink of the label with oil). I couldn’t recall a single thing about “Corvo,” and when I noticed the notes printed on the back of the label I aggressively ignored them. 😊

What I was greeted with upon application was… indescribable. Or nearly so. Not quite frankincense, but something cozy yet burnt—something reminiscent of large black feathers. They got the name right!

I loved the incense-filled beginning, though it eventually settled into… a Creamsicle? That was my first thought, but it wasn’t quite sweet enough to be a Creamsicle—though there was definitely orange in there. After searching and searching my mind, I finally found a comparison: like someone added orange blossom water to a Circus Peanut. I am sure that sounds bizarre, and frankly… it kind of is. But it is a gorgeous fragrance nonetheless, its evolution beautiful.

And loud. This one is LOUD! Only one arm or wrist (or just the base of the throat) is necessary for application. It *projects*.

Rating: **5**/5 – slumbering underneath the wing of a corvid megafauna

“Baby, It’s Cold Outside” – *A cozy holiday evening at home by the fire: the scent of oven-fresh blackberry-caramel streusel mingles with the subtle aroma of smoke from the fireplace and your favorite vanilla perfume.*

This one has been on my to-test list for a long time, so I finally got it for the holiday season. I remembered it was based around a particular fruit but couldn’t remember which one. When I smelled it… my first thought was cranberry. But it wasn’t the tart cranberry I was after—quite sweet, like Jolly Rancher did a special edition cranberry flavor. There wasn’t much evolution on me, unfortunately. Looking at the notes, I see it was supposed to be blackberry, not cranberry; regardless, it was a bit too candied for my taste (something I’ve noticed with a lot of CocoaPink blends centered around fruit), and I’m disappointed I didn’t get even a whiff of a blazing hearth.

Rating: **3**/5 – Actually, I think it’s warming up!

“White Chocolate-Covered Pretzels” – *The first treat to disappear from the plate at your holiday party: homemade pretzels dipped in fresh, creamy white chocolate and rolled in rainbow sprinkles. The perfect combination of salty and sweet.*

I have been curious about this one for ages, yet a bit leery because I’ve never seen it reviewed. My gamble was that the salt note (I have a good track record with “savory” notes) would temper the sweetness of the white chocolate and keep it from becoming cloying.

Salt is such a tricky note to pin down in perfume. Out of balance one way, you just end up with something faintly powdery or “skin-like.” Out of balance the other way, and you get pure, unadulterated *sweat*. I doubt anybody’s after the latter, but I’m not after the former, either.

But this fragrance… my gosh, they really did it. Yes, the white chocolate comes through loud and clear, rich and creamy. But then there’s the salt, the *yeast*, of the pretzels. It’s a perfect balance.

Rating: **5**/5 – warning: this may make you hungry

“Rebellion” – *sensual pomegranate infused with fresh picked blackberries, bergamot, smoky vanilla bean, vetiver, dried pinecones, injected with intoxicating hints of delicate white carnation*

While I really, really wanted the pomegranate note from this, what “Rebellion” absolutely confirmed for me is that fruit-centric CocoaPink fragrances (outside of citrus) are absolutely not for me, because I think they all smell like Jolly Ranchers and I’m not after that at all. This one even veered into cough medicine territory on my skin.

Rating: **0**/5 – home in bed with a cold and cough

“Pink Bonfire” – *the delicious aroma of Pink Sugar mingling with the sweet presence of bonfire smoke and burning leaves*

I’d gone for this one over “Pink Patchouli” because I’d worried the patch note would be too loud on my skin, and had been eager to find something to perfectly balance the sweet and the smoky. This one, though… barely did anything. I sort of smelled it in the vial, but it was there and *gone* on my skin. I almost can’t even write a review about it because it didn’t stay long enough to leave an impression. I’m reminded of the time I tested the oil for “Green Star”—I’d *really* liked that one in the vial, but it hadn’t stayed on my skin at all. It functions beautifully, however, as a linen spray. Maybe “Pink Bonfire” is like that; but I can’t recommend it as an oil, sorry.

Rating: **1**/5 – hardly got to know ya

“Back Off, I’m A Scientist!” – *A tribute to the ghost-busting trio of New York: Mounds of molten marshmallow and warm burnt sugar; glowing green apple and neon pink rhubarb; gritty dark streets; a wisp of smoke; and a sly hint of black chocolate.*

With this last one, I took a risk—because it contains an apple note. But I was hoping the apple would only act as sort of a support for the marshmallow and the neon stream-crossing accord. Because this is *Ghost Busters*, after all, and I wanted to finally know what ectoplasm smelled like. The concept has been brought up before by other houses (Fantôme and Nui Cobalt both come to mind), but I’d always gotten too much sweetness and not enough neon. I wanted my neon.

And… I didn’t get it here, sorry. The beginning was almost identical to that of “White Chocolate-Covered Pretzels,” except it didn’t have the salty foil for the sweetness. It was just… sweet. White chocolate eventually morphed into the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, but no Proton Pack arrived to blast it to smithereens and save New York City. It’s a sadly (imo) straightforward gourmand.

Rating: **2**/5 – The Choice is made, the Traveler has come… I guess.

I haven’t gotten around to any of the scrubs I’ve ordered yet, but I have ample experience with the scrub and highly recommend it. Outside of the scrubs, I’m a bit disappointed in the sample set of oils I ordered, because I’m only keeping one of them. However… the freebie oil turned out to be a delight! I think that might be the sweet-and-smoky perfume I’ve been searching for.

**Birch & Besom**

“Chaotic Good” – *banana cotton candy & a vanilla bean milkshake, drizzled with marshmallow sauce*

The first thing I smelled was a good old-fashioned banana. And I do mean old-fashioned: banana flavoring is based on the [Gros Michel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Michel), or “Big Mike,” banana that our great-grandparents and grandparents bought for their families at the grocery store. A terrible fungus destroyed enough of the crop that another variety of banana had to be grown for mass consumption, which is the one most of us in the Western World eat today: the [Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavendish_banana) banana, which has a far milder taste and smell. (Personally, I think we should all eat more [Red bananas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_banana), but that’s neither here nor there.)

Nevertheless, the aroma of banana-flavored Laffy Taffy invaded my nostrils, both from the vial and upon initial application. D4L started playing in my head (which hasn’t happened since high school), that’s how strong this note is. Eventually, however, it mellows out into a light, perfume-y aroma, almost becoming something “traditional.” Because, in the end, this character really is “good.”

I ended up testing this side-by-side with my FS of “Chaotic Evil” (which I’ve absolutely fallen in love with), and the beginnings are very similar, though CE is a bit foodier and less candied than CG, and only deepens its gourmand aroma with time (introducing bakery and booze aspects). For this reason, I think it might be a bit redundant to have both in your perfume collection. If you want a banana perfume that has a bold initial splash but is ultimately not terribly loud, then you want CG. But if you want to revel in the more gourmand notes, then you want CE.

Rating: **4**/5 – I am reminded of the high school football “GO BANANAS” cheer in the stands.

“Lawful Good” – *thick, gooey marshmallow draped over warm cardamom and golden amber, with a gentle waft of censer smoke*

This is clean and almost liturgical. I remember anticipating some sweetness before testing, but my skin seems to have bypassed all of it—everything is in support of the frankincense, and the smoking, swinging thurible. It is very much the fragrance of a paladin.

Rating: **3.5**/5 – knight in shining armor needs to let loose

“Satin Bat” – *juicy plum, ripe currants, heady amber, cool mineralic cave air, musky ambrette, bourbon vanilla, and a whisper of pink pepper*

The two New Year’s fragrances were included as freebies with my order, and this was the first one I tried. Out of the vial was the unmistakable aroma of high-end hairspray—a note that reminded me of two Pulp outings: “Hall of Mirrors” and “Witching Night.” Of the two, I’d say “Satin Bat” is closer to WN because that one had a slight lemon undertone (lemon cakes, mainly), and this has a soft raspberry running throughout. But the softness just made me long for more raspberry—one of my favorite notes—and consider caving and getting that 10mL “Cipher” from Stone & Wit.

Meanwhile, HoM is the one of the two that I own, and I don’t think there’s a great enough difference to justify owning both, so despite how much I enjoy it, this one is going away.

Rating: **4**/5 – managed to make a boudoir scent that *doesn’t* smell like face powder

“Chaotic Neutral” – *a suede doublet freckled with specks of banana cotton candy and flecks of decadent pistachio gelato*

This was wild. I got that Gros Michel banana note in the beginning, but it didn’t stay strictly banana. Quickly, it turned into bubblegum—we’re talking Double Bubble, Bubble Yum territory. It’s a rich bubblegum that lingers for some time, before morphing into a similar frankincense that’s in LG. That must be a component of the “suede” accord B&B uses.

CN is that rare smoky, deep fragrance that would work well in summer (due to the bubblegum).

Rating: **5**/5 – big chew to it

“Moon Kitten” – *tart gooseberry, delicately sweet elderflower, airy lilac, creamy heliotrope, Madagascar & bourbon vanillas, and soft sandalwood*

This was the last one of the lot that I tested, and my first thought was, “CHOCOLATE!” And my second. And my third. It’s one of the best chocolate fragrances I’ve tried, rich and decadent with a hint of coffee (not brewed—just the beans). I find it similar to CocoaPink “Black Chocolate” (which I often layer with the “Coffee” scent from the same house).

Color me surprised when I look at the notes list and… there’s no chocolate. This is a repeat of “Local Haunt” containing no apples—this thing does not have a chocolate note! How on Earth is that possible‽ I don’t think I even get the fruit notes. Is it the combination of vanilla(s) and sandalwood? I don’t even know, man.

Rating: **4**/5 – I am, once again, so confused right now.

And… that’s it for my Birch & Besom order. Three of the samples are going into away, but I’m glad to have found some hits once again—including another vial of puzzlement! The next fragrances I’d like to try from this house all sound like they’d do better in warm weather, so I likely won’t order from here again until the summertime.",11,1736213484.0,Indiemakeupandmore,4,1.0,False

But, I’ve been living here since 2022 and the 1st year I was in college and depressed but now it’s 2024 I’m not in college and not depressed and have a good job ok pay . I live in lower Nob hill. How do I make the most out of living in the city? I feel like I complain quite a bit about not doing anything but I know there’s so much to do. So, what do I do? I regret being ungrateful and being like I want to move when truly a big part of me loves living here and I know if I move it’ll be out of SF and I just want to make the best memories here so when it comes time to move I won’t want to. 
I’ve been to the beaches in Daly City and I don’t really have access to a car not that I would need one here. But, what are some things I could do? Where could I go? What foods and coffee shops should I try? What hobbies could I take up to meet people? Also going out budget for the month is 250$. Food is another 150$. If that helps. I just don’t have too many friends to do things with either. 
Thank you so much in advance would love to do things in the city and embrace living here in my early 20s❤️

She consistently tries to carve a path for herself that isn’t connected to her “illnesses”, whether it’s fashion, travel, coffee, her poor attempts at psychology, or motivational speeches lol. However, at the end of the day, her cancer is what gets people engaged, and I think she hates it. She goes on these rants about self-improvement and what people need to be doing to better themselves and their lives while being deaf to the fact that she is wildly unstable herself. I don’t know what her degree is in but when she tries to assert herself as a mental health guru, it genuinely makes me upset because of the influence she has on vulnerable people, because of her CANCER!  When people gain a following/platform for one specific thing and then feel like they are qualified to speak on completely unrelated, incredibly sensitive subjects, it shows their true naivety and lack of self-awareness. So the reason I’m posting this thread is to get others thoughts/opinions on if they see how she is exploiting her platform and imo, abusing the attention she’s gained from her cancer.

1hvfn11,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1hvfn11/next_animal_crossing/,Next Animal crossing ,"Idk if there’s going to be another animal crossing game, but if there is, I hope there’s elements that were in new leaf that are in it. 

I’ll admit that I get bored of how slow paced it is, but there were elements in new leaf that I missed in New Horizons. 

One of the biggest thing was manipulating Tortimer’s island by chopping down most of the trees and getting rid of all the bushes so only expensive Beetles and sharks spawn. And then fishing! I HATED fishing in NH. I also missed playing hide and seek, the island tours, the way the coffee shop worked, and all yhe stores and the club. 

If we could get an animal crossing with those elements, maybe a little faster paced (filling the 12 month calendar is too slow) and elements of NH that people really liked, and then the typical upgrades, I think we could have an amazing game 

What about you guys? What do you want to see? 

This isn’t to hate on NH, there were great elements in it. The museum was much better, I liked crafting, I liked being able to landscape, I liked that your character could be customized. ",1,1736212710.0,AnimalCrossing,3,1.0,False

1hvflvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/1hvflvu/mess_hall_stores/,Mess hall store's.,"At a garage sale I ran across Navy Cook book of all things... It got me remembering the food we were provided. 

Basic Training Fort Lost in the Woods...

The mess hall experience was Meh.. there were no holidays during the time I was there ... I don't remember gagging form the look, smell or taste. OD Green beans...

Field training was still C rats.

AIT ... Fort McC.

Again ...The mess hall experience was Meh.. there were no holidays during the time I was there ... I don't remember gagging form the look, smell or taste. Tho we did get hamburgers and Fry's and pizza twice a month.

Permanent party -- OMG! Breakfast -- They never realty got it right, eggs up, down, over never were easy. Fried potatoes always soggy. This was the US Army in the FGR so there was no hamburger line or pizza. Spaghetti -- put your tray down get up to get a glass of milk and there would be a 1 inch ring of grease/oil around the plate. Pigs feet that looked -- well piggy -- boiled steamed. They looked like they came from sad piggy's.

Tired looking fruit, sorry looking mini apples and oranges (you had to go down to the MarketPlaz to see real fruit) ... Pork chops OMFG! Pork chops that if dropped from a height of 8 to 10 inch above the plate would break but still would be uncut-able with a butter knife or even a buck knife. Made in the morning and kept in a steam try for hours before luncheon or Din din.

A Spec 4 loudly complained about a pork chop he got that was uncut-able with a buck knife in front of a new Battalion CSM...He tried and failed to cut too.

The last part was what got the Mess Sgt and the OIC 'buts' put in a wringer by the new Command Sgt Major. 

The food did get better after that, you could actually has some salad (Lettuce) oil and vinegar. Much less grease and oil and eggs that didn't look like they came from chicken in a old age home. Old eggs have a flatter yolk and a thinner, runnier white, and may show signs of discoloration like pink. If you looked close while you were in the line at the grill you would see the tell tail signs. Breakfast did get better but I had already bought a coffee maker and converter for my office so I rarely ate in the mornings on work days tho on the week ends I went to breakfast most of the time.

You didn't have to buy your own Tabasco sauce tho at the end of the month the yardbirds had swiped most of the table bottles.

But Holidays I will have to give the mess hall their due for those meals. Well done, well done indeed. 

Then there was TDY and mermite can hot chow, no help there 50/50 troops would rather had C rats.

On the other hand mermite can Hot chocolate -- with 50% mermite can Coffee A OK!

And Oddly someone a new cook who knew how to bake in that mess hall appeared. Sheet cakes had tasted like sheet cakes mix the contents of the box with the other box of stuff and bake. Edible but just. 

Then we started getting thing that were almost fought over. 

People were coming from other battalions to get some. It steam rolled the mess hall in one of the best.

Then of all things the Cook / Master baker got the boot from his wife and lost most of what he owned in the divorce and started to drink a bit and was on that downward spiral. Then the fairy Godmother dept took pity on him and he won the German lottery and went AWOL. 

I heard he was sending post cards to his Mess Sgt that said Hi it's me in Paris - Switzerland - Australia... He eventually came back and took a AR15 back Pvt2 from Spec 6 I was told, but dam I do remember missing the hell out of his cakes.

1hvfkxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roborock/comments/1hvfkxa/new_rule_alert_no_trolling/,🚨 New Rule Alert: No Trolling 🚨,"Hey everyone,

We've got a fresh new rule to keep our subreddit as pleasant as a warm cup of coffee on a Monday morning: **Rule # 7 No Trolling**.

**What is a troll?**  
A troll is someone who intentionally posts inflammatory, irrelevant, or offensive messages online to provoke an emotional response from others.  

Here are some key characteristics of trolling:

* **Deliberate Provocation:** Trolls don't simply hold unpopular opinions. They actively seek to upset, anger, or offend others.  
* **Lack of Genuine Discussion:** Trolls are not interested in having a meaningful conversation. Their primary goal is to disrupt, derail, and cause chaos.  
* **Focus on Emotion, Not Logic:** Trolls often use inflammatory language, personal attacks, and logical fallacies to provoke strong reactions.  
* **Enjoyment of Conflict:** Trolls thrive on the negative attention they receive. They often relish the arguments and outrage they cause.

Think of them as the digital version of someone who purposefully steps on your toes just to see you react—not exactly the kind of person you want at a friendly gathering. That's why we're so keen on keeping our subreddit a troll-free zone!

If you encounter a troll, the best course of action is usually to ignore them. Engaging with a troll often only serves to escalate the situation and provide them with the attention they crave.

**Important Note:**

* **Not all strong opinions or disagreements constitute trolling.**
* **Healthy debate and differing viewpoints are essential for a vibrant online community.**

Trolling and baiting will result in a 7-day or longer ban. It is under mod discretion if you are trolling and baiting. Yes, we have the ban hammer, and we're not afraid to use it! ⚒️

Why are we doing this, you ask? Because a troll-free subreddit is a happy subreddit. So, let's all work together to keep our space troll-free and enjoyable for everyone. After all, life’s too short to deal with trolls—save the trolling for the mythical creatures in fairy tales!

Thank you for your understanding and support! If you have any questions or need clarification on this new rule, feel free to reach out to the mod team. We promise we don't bite... unless you're a troll. 😉🦀

Stay awesome and troll-free! 🌟",23,1736212549.0,Roborock,0,0.93,False

1hvfkf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1hvfkf4/anyone_else_scammed_recently_by_a_postal_inspector/,"Anyone Else Scammed Recently by a ""Postal Inspector"" ","Recently, my identity was stolen, went through all the channels, they took out large sums of cash from my bank account. Long story short, credit was frozen, bank reversed charges, got me a new account, I reported everything to the various channels, post office, police precinct, etc. It was long and boring, and took a few days. 

When I got to my apartment a few days after reporting everything, this business card was left in front of my apartment, wedged in the door:

>**ETHAN ZUBKOFF**  
**Postal Inspector**  
New York Division

>**United States Postal Inspection Service**  
Established 1775

>370 9th Avenue, 3rd Floor  
New York, NY 10001

>O: (917) 621-9318  
F: (650) 577-2736  
Email: [EMZUBKOFF@USPIS.GOV]()  
Website: [www.uspis.gov](http://www.uspis.gov/)

I called the number since it was just a couple of days since I reported everything to the precinct, nothing seemed out of ordinary. 

They said that they were inspecting my incident, I told them what happened (in hindsight, I realize this may have been stupid, but I did **not** give away any specifics at least), and they recommended we meet up so they can collect more information. They recommended a coffee shop and that he'll be there with ""his partner who is also a postal inspector."" 

Red flag. 

I decided to look up the address on the business card. This does not appear to be an official NYC building—it's on the same block as the midtown post office, but it's not the actual address. The phone number is a 917 number which is usually a mobile and easy for a scammer to get via VoiP. The fax number is 650 which is San Francisco. 

I looked up the email address, nothing. And his name is not associated with anything I could find online. At this point, I was feeling pretty duped. 

I called the official post office 877 number, talked to someone, but they couldn't verify if he was a field officer, so they would ""follow up"" tomorrow because she didn't have access to the NYC region list of inspectors (apparently). 

Has this happened to anyone else? I've read that there are plenty of inspector impersonators, but this seemed so legit and so close to my identity theft, that I can't help but think there's something more advanced going on, otherwise, this is a real coincidence.

No, I don’t think the plane would’ve crashed. I think I was going to die tonight. And it had nothing to do with the flight.

The moment the clock turned to midnight on January 1, I (18F) just had this vision of be being buried and everyone, EVERYONE I know, mourning. I can’t even explain how or why.

On January 3rd those feelings persisted. Me, my dad, and my grandparents all drove up to West Point, NY for something we needed to do. We passed by the West Point Cemetery, and I was thinking about how I wanted to be buried there when I die (if you’re unaware it’s a military cemetery. I’m eligible to be buried there because my dad is a USMA alum).

I brought it up to my mom yesterday. I said “I don’t want to be morbid but that’s where I want to be buried” or something along those lines.

Last night I drank coffee at 10:30 so I could stay awake and work on the novel I’m writing. I have never in my life done this. No surprise, I couldn’t fall asleep until 5:30. I thought about one thing the entire time. Dying.

When I woke up at like 9:30 this morning, I immediately thought to myself, “this is my last day alive.” Do I sound crazy yet? In between every rational thought of mine, “Catherine stfu you’re not going to die anytime soon,” I thought, “this is my last day alive.”

I had a flight from Harrisburg to Atlanta (6:00PM), the  from Atlanta to Ontario, CA. I had about 45 minutes between my connecting flights. I was planning on visiting my boyfriend who lives in Cali. I’ve never flown by myself: I’ve taken hundreds of flights, never alone.

After I checked my bags in and made it to my gate, I was miserable. I wanted to do anything but board that flight.

Eventually I boarded and braced myself for my death. I’m not exaggerating. That is what I was doing. I seriously felt like I was marching towards my death.

20, 30 minutes go by and we still haven’t left our gate. The weather in PA is fucking crazy right now, which was the reason for the problems. I started getting nervous about making my Ontario flight. I got up from my seat, walked to the flight attends, explained the situation and they told they didn’t think I was going to make it. Immediately they started giving me solutions. I could get to Atlanta and get checked into a hotel; fly from Atlanta to LAX and THEN to Ontario, etc. I was getting really overwhelmed at this point because I had no idea what to do.

Then I look down at my phone, and my parents are blowing it up, calling me every second, all of which were going to voicemail. I call my mom back, and she tells me, “Ask to get off the plane right now.” 

I simply told the flight attendants I was just going to gather my stuff and get off, and go home. They were more than accommodating, fair, and gracious. I couldn’t believe they had actually let me off, they were just about to take off at this point. 

I called my mom back and she was shaking and sobbing. All she kept saying was, “when you boarded that flight (I was updating my parents of everything that was going on due to my paranoia) I knew you had no business being on it. Something horrible was going to happen to you.”

I’m currently in my dads car, and we’re driving back home. I feel absolutely gutted and depleted. Subconsciously, I thought I was reading meaning into something that wasn’t real. Subconsciously, I thought I was being ridiculous the past week. That I’m obviously not going to die. You would’ve felt / thought the same way.

I have no idea what would’ve happened if I boarded that flight. I don’t think there would’ve been an accident despite the weather conditions. Would something have happened at that hotel? Would the second flight have a problem?

I feel shaken to my core. I didn’t really buy the “moms always know” idea until today. If you actually read all of this nonsense, and you think I’m being ridiculous and nothing would’ve happened, maybe you’re right.

But for right now, I’m irrevocably grateful to be in this car and not in the sky.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever thought about how you can earn extra money from the comfort of your home? Participating in mock trials as an online juror is one exciting and rewarding option. This unique opportunity lets you engage in the legal process while being compensated for your time and insights.

Mock trials are simulations of real court cases. They are often utilized by law firms, attorneys, and law schools to gauge the potential outcome of a trial, test legal strategies, or train future lawyers. Your role as an online juror is vital. You’ll give feedback and your thoughts on the trial proceedings, helping the attorney refine their case. Here’s how you can get started.

### What Does It Mean to Be an Online Juror?

An online juror participates in a mock trial that takes place over the internet. Unlike real trials, which could be long and drawn out, mock trials are often shorter and more focused. They usually consist of two parts: listening to the case presented and discussing it afterward with sometimes a panel of other jurors. Your job is to analyze the arguments presented, just like a real juror would.

### Steps to Participate in Mock Trials

If you want to participate in mock trials and earn money, follow these steps:

1. **Find Legitimate Websites:** Start by searching for credible websites that offer mock trial opportunities. Websites like *eJury* and *OnlineVerdict* are popular options.
2. **Sign Up:** Create an account on the platform. You may need to provide some personal information, including your age, background, and experience to match you with appropriate cases.
3. **Take Screening Tests:** Some platforms might require you to take a screening test to ensure you understand the basics of legal proceedings.
4. **Participate in Mock Trials:** Once accepted, you will receive notifications about upcoming trials. Choose the ones you want to participate in and make sure to complete them on time.
5. **Get Paid:** After completing a mock trial, you’ll receive payment, which can range from $20 to $60 per case, depending on the complexity and the platform.

### What Is Expected from You?

Being an online juror requires active participation and attention to detail. Here’s what you should keep in mind:

- **Stay Focused:** Your job is to listen intently to the case and provide constructive feedback based on what you perceive. Avoid distractions.
- **Engage in Discussions:** After the trial, you may be asked to give your opinion alongside other jurors. Engaging in these discussions enhances the experience for everyone involved.
- **Stay Honest:** Offer genuine feedback to help attorneys refine their arguments. The mock trial experience is a learning opportunity for all parties.

### Benefits of Participating in Mock Trials

Participating in these mock trials not only gives you a chance to earn money but also presents several benefits:

- **Flexible Schedule:** You choose when you want to participate. This flexibility is perfect for fitting with your life.
- **Gain Legal Knowledge:** Even if you’re not pursuing a legal career, you will learn a lot about the court system and legal concepts.
- **Develop Critical Thinking Skills:** Analyzing cases helps sharpen your critical thinking and analytical skills, which are useful in various fields.

In addition to these advantages, engaging in mock trials can be an enjoyable way to contribute to the legal field. If you appreciate analyzing arguments or enjoy the idea of being part of a jury, this is a perfect fit for you.

So, if you're looking to earn some money and have a fascinating experience, start exploring opportunities to participate in mock trials as an online juror. It could turn out to be more rewarding than you ever expected!

### Flexibility in Scheduling

One of the biggest perks of serving as an online juror for mock trials is the flexibility it brings to your schedule. Unlike traditional jobs, you can choose when to participate. Many mock trials are available during evenings or weekends, allowing you to work around your commitments. This makes it an excellent opportunity for students, stay-at-home parents, or anyone with a flexible daily routine.

### Gain Legal Insights

Being an online juror offers a unique opportunity to gain insights into the legal system. You’ll learn about legal procedures, terminology, and the strategies lawyers use in presenting their cases. This knowledge can be beneficial if you ever find yourself in a real jury situation or if you are considering a career in law.

The Legal System: Understanding the Role of Jurors
--------------------------------------------------

The legal system plays a vital role in society, and jurors are a key part of this process. You might wonder what jurors do and why they are so important. Let’s take a closer look at their role and the significance they have in ensuring justice is served.

### The Purpose of Jurors

Jurors are individuals called upon to deliver a verdict in a trial. They listen to evidence, evaluate testimonies, and ultimately decide the outcome of a case. The main purpose of jurors is to provide a fair and impartial judgment based on the facts presented. Their decisions can influence lives, so understanding their responsibilities is crucial.

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
### The Selection Process

Before a juror can participate in a trial, there is a selection process known as ""voir dire."" Here’s how it works:

- **Random Selection:** Potential jurors are selected at random from the community. This can come from driver's license records, voter registrations, and other public documents.
- **Questioning:** Once selected, candidates are questioned by both the defense and the prosecution to ensure they can remain impartial.
- **Excusal:** Some candidates may be excused from jury duty due to biases, conflicts of interest, or personal hardships.
- **Final Selection:** A final jury is formed, usually consisting of 6 to 12 jurors, depending on the case and jurisdiction.

### The Responsibilities of Jurors

Being a juror comes with several important responsibilities. Here are some key duties:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Listening:** Jurors must attentively listen to the evidence and testimonies presented during the trial.
- **Analyzing Evidence:** They must critically analyze the provided information to determine its relevance and credibility.
- **Deliberation:** After the trial, jurors discuss and deliberate among themselves to reach a consensus on the verdict.
- **Rendering a Verdict:** jurors must objectively deliver their verdict, whether guilty or not guilty, based on the evidence.

### The Importance of Impartiality

Impartiality is a cornerstone of the juror's role. A juror must set aside personal beliefs and opinions to focus solely on the facts of the case. This is vital to the integrity of the legal system. If jurors allow personal biases to influence their decisions, it undermines the very foundation of justice.

### Challenges Faced by Jurors

Being a juror can come with several challenges. Some of these include:

My #1 Choice for Residual Income in 2025: https://freepage.pro/mylestonedigital/map-passive  
  
- **Emotional Toll:** Cases, especially those involving serious crimes, can take an emotional toll. Jurors may find it difficult to process graphic evidence or hear distressing testimonies.
- **Time Commitment:** Trials can sometimes last for weeks. This requires jurors to set aside personal and professional responsibilities.
- **Group Dynamics:** Deliberation involves group discussion where differing opinions can lead to conflict, requiring patience and tolerance.


Jurors play an essential role in the legal system, helping to ensure fairness and justice. Their function transcends just making decisions; they are a bridge between the law and the community. By understanding the significance of jurors, we acknowledge the important contributions they make within our society’s judicial framework. As such, it's vital to respect, support, and encourage civic engagement in the jury duty process.

Remember, if you ever receive a jury summons, it's not just a chore; it's an opportunity to make a real impact in your community. By participating, you help uphold the values of justice, fairness, and democracy.

1hvf853,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1hvf853/pietro_grind_comparison/,Pietro Grind Comparison,"(Posting from mobile, forgive the formatting!)

Howdy y'all! I'm the guy that asked about whether a $250 used (like-new) Pietro was worth it a few weeks ago. I ended up buying it, and after having it for a few weeks I'm back to share my thoughts.

I've still not perfectly dialed it in, but this morning I brewer two cups at different grind sizes and compared them head-to-head. To reduce margin of error in each brew, I personally like to use the Hario Mugen for these tests. I used a natural process bean from Uganda that I roasted myself on Dec. 18.
Both cups were a 1:17 ratio of 15g/255ml poured in one go at 93℃. I brewed one cup at 8.1, and the other at 4.1. I like starting with vastly different grinds to highlight the differences, and then work my way towards my ideal grind size. (For reference, Lance Hedrick claims to use an 8.5, but I've found that to be too coarse for my personal liking.) Onto the cups!

The 8.1 cup had very bright acidity, tea-like body, and a gentle aftertaste. Great clarity as well, but my palette still isn't trained enough to properly pick out specific notes without hints. 
Honestly, a cup I'd be perfectly happy with at a cafe or from a specialty roaster. As the coffee cooled, it became a bit juicier and more sweetness came to the forefront.

The 4.1 cup, as you'd expect, had a fuller body. It was also a much juicer cup from the start, but lacked a bit of the clarity of the 8.1 cup. Not in a bad way, the flavors were just much more present which made them hard to pick apart. Balanced is probably a better word. It had a fuller aftertaste which was very pleasant. You get to keep enjoying the coffee even after you've finished it! It did have a *very* subtle papery/nutty flavor, probably over extracted, but not enough to really impact the overall cup. I had to get real picky to notice it.

So, all that to say, there's a reason I didn't get around to doing this comparison until today, weeks after I got the grinder. It's because I haven't made a bad cup of coffee with it yet. I didn't really feel rushed to do a bunch of experiments and dial it in because you just don't need to in order to get passable results.Even at drastically different grind sizes, it's still producing ***good*** cups of coffee. Yes, sometimes you can tell it's not the BEST cup of coffee, but they're never *unpleasant*.

Listen, it's not the easiest thing to grind with, the catch cup isn't ideal, and it's huge and heavy. But I haven't even done a head to head with my K6 because it's so obviously better coffee (to me). 110% worth it for $250, and I get the hype. Thanks for everyone who told me to snag it, I probably wouldn't have if it weren't for you guys!",9,1736211572.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

Hi all! 

After being without an espresso machine for the last few years I purchased a Breville express impress and for the life of me cannot get it to dial in properly. I don’t remember ever having had so many issues trying to pull a decent shot with the older (and less fancy) Breville models, and it’s to the point that I’ve stopped even making coffee in the mornings. 

I am using my scale to ensure I am using 18g of beans, and then timing that the shot is pulling for 25 seconds, but I cannot seem to get the proper output. All of my shots are pulling nearly double what they should - and are no where near 36 grams.

Previously, I cooked for the family. Many chinese meals and sometimes deep fry chicken etc. I used organic as much as I could and use avocado for cooking oil and never reuse oils more than twice. I also have a teenaged daughter who enjoys my cooking. 

I’m more aware of my diet now. I try to avoid ultra processed foods but if I crave some candy, i’ll pop one. I’m also cutting back on coffee and sugar (previously in keto so not hard) and cutting back on fatter foods but i’m not going to go on full depriving myself of foods I like. If I want butter on my bread, I’ll use them! 

I’m also not going to be spending money on more clothes or whatnots so my luxury now is to enjoy my meals. I’m also on day 2 on kisqali and did feel mild nausea so no idea if it will get worse and my appetite will totally be gone. 

Anyways my point is I would love to continue cooking foods my daughter loves. She is a teenager. Not going to force her to eat steam fish all the time! I’ll eat mildly healthy but not going to stop myself from indulging once in a while.

I got the Oracle Jet brand new on December 23. I probably brewed on average at least 6-10 coffee a day since I gotten it. Probably more. I mostly brew decaf.

I have tried many decaf, always freshly roasted (small bags) ~ 2 weeks old in average.

Here are some I tried

- 49th Parallel - Swiss water decaf
- Kicking Horse decaf
- Rogue Wave Huila Community 
- Equator J.O.M.O
- Saint-Henri Zen Decaf
- Rousseau Mexico Decaf
- Nektar le refuge decaf
- Morgane decaf
etc.

I used to have to grind between 32 to 38 to have a brew time between 25-30 seconds but now I always have to adjust the grind size around 18-25. For exemple 2 weeks ago when I got the 49th parallel decaf, the grind size had to be 38 and now it needs to be 24. They are well stored in a container that removes air.

Also, sometimes despite not touching anything, I could brew 4 times the same coffee, same beans of the same batch in 15 minutes and sometimes the brew time will be 20 seconds and some other times 30 seconds. 

How reliable is the grinder supposed to be and why is it so much different from one brew to another?

Also, I always brew one empty porta filter to heat everything up.

I was wondering if food from my fridge should be thrown away. The following was what I had in the fridge before my vacation:
- Yogurt
- Orange Juice
- Condiments (Ketchup, Aoli, Bbq sauce)
- Coffee creamer
- Salami
- Blocks of cheese
- Grated Parmesan
- Protein Drinks 

Not too worried about the Juice and Condiments. The rest, which has dairy, is what I am concerned about. ",0,1736211039.0,Cooking,4,0.43,False

Just looking for some advice!

My company are sending me to Japan next week on business travel - a big conference where I will be presenting much of day two.

Unfortunately as my travel date is so soon the department in Japan are unable to process my application to take my meds with me. Elvanse is a controlled substance and an application must be made to import it into the country. I’ve spoken with countless people on the phone and the Japanese consulate, there really isn’t anything that can’t be done. 

The trip was a last minute decision and there was no option for me to submit an application in time. On the phone I was told I ‘should have submitted my application by the 19th of December’ which is completely fair, I understand they have a backlog, but I wasn’t aware I was even travelling until last Friday!

Other than self-medicating with coffee does anyone have any tips? I’ve been on it solidly since April so I’m expecting withdrawals to some extent and of course I’m concerned about not functioning at an event where I really need to be. I’m honestly mostly concerned about being around people for 12 hour days and not having my brain turn to mush. 

Any tips, tricks, insight you can provide would be greatly appreciated!",1,1736211025.0,adhdwomen,3,0.67,False

I, 30F, met up with a guy, 30M, last weekend. We went to school together, were never friends, but reconnected a few years ago over social media. We established a casual friendship over the years, sometimes messaging one another. I always wanted to meet up in real life, but was in a relationship with another man and knew that would bother my now ex-partner.

My partner and I are no longer together and I was visiting my family for the holidays and decided to message this guy from social media, asking if he wanted to hang out (coffee and chat).
He enthusiastically responded that he'd enjoy that.

We met up last weekend at a coffee shop and i thought it went very well. We had great, deep talks. He started really asking me about my previous relationship, how it is going now, etc... I was very clear that I am single and over that relationship. To be honest, towards the end, it felt a bit like a date. We hung out for several hours and only parted ways to go home after the café closed.

As we were leaving, he gave me a full hug (not a half, one-armed hug) and said he'll text me (he wanted to send me some links to things we discussed) and said we should hang out again before I go back home after the holidays.he said he enjoyed our time together.

And then...radio silence. I texted him a few times afterwards about other topics like books, and he enthusiastically responded. He also said he'll send me the links soon.
And then nothing. So, I just straight forward asked if he still wanted to hang out again before I return home. No Response. Then, two days ago, I asked him if I misterpreted our time together and just mentioned that I genuinely enjoyed it and would love to continue building up a friendship with him (so it was clear how I felt). I tried to word my message so that it didn't sound like I was mad at him.

He didn't even leave me on read, he juat hasn't even opened it, but I see he is sometimes active on social media.

So - why? Did he just decide he wasn't interested afterall? Or am I pushing too hard for a response? Up until now, we had sometimes talked on social media, but it wasn't constant back and forth. I understand not everyone responds constantly, but it's obvious now he is ignoring me. Very mixed signals imo.

I think the situation is unfortunate and I was actually pretty interested in him (as a friend and maybe even more tbh). I'll get over it, lol. But, I'm just wondering why people do this?",2,1736210891.0,relationship_advice,4,0.76,False

1hvexg3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hvexg3,"We Ditched the Dining Room, Now What?","We have lived in our house for 13 years. When we moved in, I dutifully set up this space as the dining room because that’s what the floor plan said, duh. It was always a little tight, if it had been even a foot larger in both directions, they would’ve been much better flow around the dining room table. We have a large eat in kitchen and on impulse this year. I set up our meal on a 6 foot folding banquet table as a buffet, and we all sat at the kitchen table. Fast forward to Christmas, we did the same thing again, and nobody seemed to mind and actually felt more comfortable.

So now it’s a week after New Year’s, and I have sold my table, chairs, and sideboard. We have plans to install white built-in upper and lower cabinets, wrapping around the corner where the china cabinet remains. We are thinking glass front upper cabinets and this would take the place of the storage we lose with the dining furniture gone. (The china cabinet will then go.)  We would like the room to turn into a sitting room with more of a library/bourbon room bent. We already have a living room with baby grand piano and a family room. This will be more of an “away space” with no TV. We think we can fit three chairs and would like a coffee table or ottoman. I’d like a space to a puzzle in this room.

What would you do? Anything is fair game at this point. I just don’t want to paint the window and door trim, I’d like to keep it consistent with the rest of the house. 

The room is 11’6” x 12’6”.

1) Should all three chairs be the same? I’m leaning towards B & C being matching leather club chairs and A being a barrel/swivel chair to help keep the flow open from the foyer to the kitchen since that will become a path of travel which it never was before due to the dining table being in the way.

2) Wall color and rug can change or stay the same, open to all suggestions. 

3) What other furniture would you bring in? The only other thing I’d really like to bring in is a small chest on a stand that my grandfather made. It’s about 12” x 20” ",11,1736210728.0,DesignMyRoom,30,0.92,False
