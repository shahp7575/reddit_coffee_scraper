Best way I can describe it is metal, with a slight hint of trash, and old man breath. It wasn't as obvious while in the container, but when I took a sip I knew something was seriously wrong. 

I exchanged it for the nescafe house brand stuff which doesn't have the taste. 

The thing is, though, that it made me ill. And I still feel ill almost an hour later. Its like I can feel it in my stomach, and still taste it on my breath.

In most cases, it can be difficult to get a refund after opening the product. I'm lucky I could get a refund because I couldn't afford to buy another container of coffee out of my pocket today. 

Has anyone else had this experience with tasters choice lately? I feel so gross man. I took one sip and I just feel gross like I ate something spoiled. 

Yes I did confirm that the particular odor/taste was coming from the instant coffee and not from somewhere else. And the Nescafe Clasico instantly tasted much better. ",1,1734741580.0,InstantCoffee,0,1.0,False

So, after months of lurking (and a handful of half-written posts), I'm finally taking the plunge and giving this a shot. I know they say the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, but in my case, it begins with a single post. So, here goes nothing, right? Haha.

**What am I looking for?**

In a nutshell‚Äîauthentic, meaningful conversation. A few days ago, a few other faculty members and I met up for an evening out to celebrate the end of finals. A few of us stayed pretty late, pontificating about life, talking about the most random topics, and basically just enjoying each other's company. I don't know about you, but in today's world (where so many of us are glued to Zoom screens and remote work), we need more of that sort of dynamic‚Äîjust genuine, authentic, long-form discourse. I like to believe with the right sort of person (and the right sort of conversational skills), you can cultivate that sort of vibe in online conversation.

For example, when I think back to the past, one of my favorite memories was a lengthy conversation I had with a random stranger at a cozy little coffee shop in a small town in Upstate New York. We talked about everything from philosophy to the best type of coffee beans. That's the sort of conversation I crave!

**A bit about me:**

* I'm 34, male, and teach in higher education.
* I finished my doctorate a few years ago (Finally! I can now add ""doctor"" to my name without having to prescribe anything or perform surgery, haha ‚Äî although that dissertation was brutal, just sayin').
* I love the outdoors and often take local day trips to explore new trails and scenic spots.
* I have a passion for photography, always trying to capture that perfect shot.
* Journaling and poetry are my ways of reflecting and expressing my thoughts, even if my poems often end up sounding like Dr. Seuss after too much coffee.
* Long hikes are my therapy. Nature has a way of putting things into perspective.
* I have a knack for making terrible puns. Consider yourself warned.
* I like to pretend I'm a trivia night enthusiast, though my knowledge of obscure 90s cartoons is more impressive than practical.
* I'm convinced that breakfast foods are acceptable at any time of the day. Pancakes for dinner, anyone?
* I‚Äôve been known to binge-watch documentaries about anything from space exploration to ancient civilizations.
* I‚Äôm a coffee enthusiast and love experimenting with different brewing methods and beans.
* I‚Äôm secretly training for the ‚ÄúOlympics of Procrastination,‚Äù and I‚Äôm a gold medal contender.
* I pride myself on my ability to parallel park in one go ‚Äì a skill I wish I could add to my r√©sum√©.
* My superpower is finding the perfect GIF for any situation.

**So basically...**

I'm hoping to find thoughtful interactions with folks who genuinely want to discuss all that life has to offer. I'm drawn to people with a natural zest and curiosity for life, who embrace a growth mindset, and who value emotional intelligence and strong communication skills. If this sounds like you, send me a chat message! I'm looking forward to hearing from you!",2,1734741451.0,penpalsover30,0,1.0,False

1hiy2zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hiy2zo/wibta_for_leaving_my_poly_boyfriend_for_lying_to/,WIBTA for leaving my poly boyfriend for lying to me?,"My boyfriend (23FTM) C and I (22FTM) met on Grindr in early July and started dating later that month. The relationship initially felt safe and healthy. Shortly after we began dating, C started seeing G (29FTM), his QPP. C is poly, and since I had no experience with poly relationships, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable expressing my discomfort. A few weeks later, C and G decided to go back to being QPPs.

At the time, I was living with emotionally abusive parents, which severely impacted my mental health. After a particularly bad night, I moved in with C. For about a month, our relationship was peaceful and blossoming.

Then everything started to spiral.

I had to take C to the hospital because his home environment was unsafe, leaving us homeless for about a week. During this time, I supported him, ensuring he felt stable. Once we moved into a new apartment, things seemed to stabilize but settled into a difficult pattern. C would become angry with me for not being as neat as he is, then calm down within an hour, only for the cycle to repeat weekly.

Meanwhile, I was dealing with a medical crisis, including a cancer scare, and constant anxiety. Each time I tried to talk to C, he dismissed me, saying he wasn‚Äôt my ‚Äúlive-in therapist.‚Äù On top of this, he started believing I was possessed after I mentioned visiting a church modeled after Notre Dame in 2019, shortly before the actual Notre Dame burned down.

More recently, our intimacy has vanished, and our relationship has worsened since G returned from college. C didn‚Äôt tell me about G‚Äôs visit until the day before, when G was already on the plane. The visit itself was okay, though I had a panic attack and needed to take space in the bedroom. The next day, C seemed upset with me for needing that space. Later, after therapy, he told me he was emotionally overwhelmed by my medical issues and asked me to stop talking to him about them.

Yesterday, I woke up to find C had gone for coffee without asking if I wanted any, which was unusual for him. When I told him I was having a panic attack, he ignored me and didn‚Äôt return for 45 minutes. When he came back, he showered and said he wanted the day for himself. He gave me a vague list of errands but later called G to ask, ‚ÄúWhere are we meeting up?‚Äù before leaving. I didn‚Äôt have the chance to ask why he lied.

Before leaving, C told me to look up ‚Äútoxic relationships,‚Äù which hurt deeply. The only reasons I can think of for him calling me toxic are my executive dysfunction and talking about my health issues.

I‚Äôve decided to take some space from C to process everything. Part of me wants to stay and work through this, but another part feels like leaving might be the best option for my well-being. WIBTA if I ended this relationship?",2,1734741356.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False
1hiy2hd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1hiy2hd/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

Whether you're a gamer, musician, tech worker, or artist, that little involuntary finger twitch can be super annoying, and people are often confused about what‚Äôs actually causing it.

So, I wanted to make this post to clear up some of that confusion and give you some info on what might be going on, what to look out for, and how to fix it.

https://preview.redd.it/qiwn5luyi38e1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c99769e2533d3428c6b362ecfdb587cf89f9a08

# What is Finger Twitching?

Finger twitching, also known as *finger fasciculations*, is the involuntary movement of the muscles in your fingers. It‚Äôs a common occurrence among those who perform repetitive tasks that involve the hands and wrists. While occasional twitching is usually nothing to worry about, frequent or severe twitching might indicate an underlying problem, such as RSI, nerve compression, or stress.

**Why does this happen?**

**Muscle fasciculations**, or muscle twitches, happen when small groups of muscle fibers contract on their own without you telling them to. This is because of spontaneous activity in the nerve cells that control those muscle fibers. Here's a breakdown

# 1. How It Starts: The Motor Unit

* A **motor unit** is like a tiny team in your body that controls muscle movement. It includes:
   * A **nerve cell** (called a motor neuron).
   * The **muscle fibers** it talks to and controls.
* Normally, the brain sends a signal to the motor neuron, which then activates the muscle fibers to make them contract.
* In muscle fasciculations, the motor neuron or its connections can get ""overexcited"" or send random signals, even when the brain isn‚Äôt telling it to. This makes the muscle fibers twitch on their own

https://preview.redd.it/9cq82888j38e1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=012ff9e51292dfbcdaed6647af825bdb24f126f4

# 2. The Electrical Process Behind It

* Nerves and muscles work using tiny electrical signals.
* These signals happen because of movement of **charged particles** (ions like sodium, potassium, and calcium) in and out of cells.
* If something disrupts this balance (like low calcium or irritation to the nerve), the motor neuron might fire off signals randomly. This can cause a twitch.

https://preview.redd.it/vtk4vql8j38e1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f88f9dcea4daa6210199818259c412b88c9ed11

# 3. How the Muscle Contracts

* Nerves send signals to muscles through a connection called the **neuromuscular junction** (NMJ).
* At the NMJ, a chemical messenger called **acetylcholine** (ACh) is released to tell the muscle fibers to contract.
* In a muscle twitch:
   * The nerve can release acetylcholine randomly, even without a signal from the brain.
   * This makes the muscle fibers contract briefly, causing a visible twitch under the skin.

# Common Causes of Finger Twitching:

1. **Muscle Fatigue (The Usual Suspect)** If you‚Äôre typing or gaming for hours on end, your finger muscles can get pretty tired, and that‚Äôs when you start noticing twitching. I‚Äôve worked with a lot of gamers who get this after long gaming sessions. One of my clients, Sam, would play *Path of Exile* for hours and feel his fingers twitch afterward. It was his body‚Äôs way of saying, ‚ÄúTake a break!‚Äù

**Tip:** Try taking breaks every 30-60 minutes to stretch your fingers, wrists, and hands. Simple stretches can really help prevent that fatigue from building up.

1. **Stress & Anxiety (Yep, Your Nerves Can Get Involved)** Stress is another big culprit. When you're stressed, your nervous system can get overstimulated, which leads to muscle twitches. I‚Äôve seen this happen a lot with musicians too. Emma, a musician I worked with, had regular finger twitching when she was prepping for an important concert. Once she added things like deep breathing and yoga into her routine, the twitching calmed down.

**Tip:** Practice some stress-reducing techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga. It really helps to keep your nerves (and muscles) calm.

1. **Caffeine & Stimulants (Too Much of a Good Thing)** Caffeine is great for getting through a long workday or gaming session, but too much of it can mess with your nervous system and cause twitching. Matt, a graphic designer I worked with, found his finger twitching got worse after a few cups of coffee. Cutting back helped him a lot.

**Tip:** If you think caffeine might be a factor, try cutting back a bit or avoid it right before your most important tasks.

1. **Dehydration & Electrolyte Imbalance (The Sneaky Culprit)** When you‚Äôre focused on a project or gaming for hours, it‚Äôs easy to forget to drink enough water. But dehydration and an imbalance in electrolytes like potassium, magnesium, and calcium can mess with your muscles, leading to twitching. I worked with Lisa, a musician, who noticed her finger twitching less once she stayed more hydrated and started eating foods like bananas and spinach, which are rich in magnesium.

**Tip:** Drink enough water and make sure you're getting enough nutrients. It really can make a difference in muscle function.

1. **Nerve Compression (A Gamer‚Äôs, Tech Worker‚Äôs, and Musician‚Äôs Nightmare)** A lot of finger twitching comes from nerve compression, which is common among gamers and people who work long hours at a desk. One of my clients, Jason, had finger twitching and tingling from cubital tunnel syndrome, which happens when the nerve in your elbow gets compressed. Once he made some ergonomic changes and did nerve glides and muscle endurance exercises, the twitching went away.

**Tip:** Make sure your posture and hand positioning are good. Ergonomic tools, like wrist rests or split keyboards, can also help a ton.

1. **Sleep Deprivation (Not Just for Your Eyes)** Lack of sleep can interfere with your nervous system and cause muscle spasms, including finger twitching. It‚Äôs not just eyelid twitches you should worry about!

**Tip:** Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Your body needs rest to repair those muscles and nerves.

# Less Common but Serious Causes:

1. **Benign Fasciculation Syndrome (BFS)** Some people experience twitching for no clear reason. This is called BFS and it usually doesn‚Äôt mean anything serious. However, if the twitching is painful or lasts for a long time, it's worth checking in with a healthcare provider.
2. **Neurological Disorders** In rare cases, twitching could be a sign of something more serious, like MS or ALS, especially if it‚Äôs accompanied by weakness or muscle wasting. If that‚Äôs the case, you definitely want to get it checked out.

https://preview.redd.it/kxf7bdt1l38e1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=307b88037d4fb610a3ecef9536b1e976f7239412

  
When to Seek Help:

If your twitching goes on for weeks, doesn‚Äôt improve, or if you start feeling weak, numb, or experience pain in your fingers or hands, it‚Äôs a good idea to see a healthcare professional. And if the twitching spreads to other parts of your body or starts affecting your fine motor skills (like typing or playing an instrument), definitely reach out to a pro.

# How to Manage & Prevent Finger Twitching:

https://preview.redd.it/3kz58mkkj38e1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ce106882ab89a944a182741cfe90bde4c62161

1. **Strengthen & Build Endurance** If you‚Äôre spending a lot of time typing, gaming, or playing an instrument, building strength and endurance in your hands and fingers is key. Regular strengthening exercises can reduce fatigue and prevent twitching. [Wrist curls and grip strength exercises](https://1-hp.org/gaming-wrist-pain/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=Twitching) are great for this.
2. **Take Breaks & Stretch** I know it‚Äôs easy to get absorbed in what you're doing, but taking regular breaks and stretching is super important. Try doing a wrist stretch every hour‚Äîjust extend your arm with your palm facing out, and gently pull back your fingers with the other hand for a deep stretch.
3. **Create an Ergonomic Workspace** Your workspace setup matters! A comfortable chair, an ergonomic keyboard, and wrist rests can make a huge difference when it comes to reducing strain on your wrists and fingers.
4. **Relaxation Techniques** Stress can make a big impact on twitching, so take time for yourself to relax. Yoga, deep breathing, or even a quick walk can help keep your muscles relaxed.
5. **Nutrition Support** Make sure you‚Äôre eating a balanced diet rich in the vitamins and minerals your muscles and nerves need. Potassium, calcium, and magnesium are especially important for preventing spasms.

By understanding the causes of finger twitching and using some proactive strategies, you can get your symptoms under control and keep doing what you love‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs gaming, creating, or working. If you're still worried about persistent twitching, it‚Äôs always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional to rule out anything more serious.

I wanted to share my personal experience with tinnitus, in case it might resonate with someone. **Disclaimer:** I‚Äôm not a doctor, and I‚Äôm not a long-time tinnitus sufferer. But after some sleepless nights, a lot of research, and some experimentation, I‚Äôve discovered a few things that work for me. This is just my opinion and approach‚Äîwhat works for me might not work for everyone, but I thought it could be helpful to share.

For context, my tinnitus is mostly sound-induced and primarily affects my right ear. Like many of you, I quickly noticed it gets worse with stress. The first day I experienced it, I decided to give up coffee and sugar completely. (Thankfully, I‚Äôd been meaning to cut those out anyway.)

# The Experiment That Helped Me

I came across a post by a doctor who mentioned that tinnitus might be related to jaw stress‚Äîhow much we clench our jaws, for example. This got me thinking about all the other muscles in the face and head:

* Jaw
* Temples
* Nose
* Throat
* Forehead
* Back of the head
* Ears

I wondered if consciously relaxing these muscles could help. One night, I decided to try a 15-minute **facial muscle relaxation meditation**. Here‚Äôs what I did:

1. Focused on relaxing the muscles around my temples.
2. Moved on to the muscles around my nose and mouth.
3. Relaxed my throat, back of my head, mind, ears, and eyes.
4. Stayed in this deeply relaxed state for as long as I could.

That night, I experienced something incredible. For the first time in days, my tinnitus became very faint‚Äîalmost unnoticeable. This was during a time when it was usually at its loudest. I didn‚Äôt use any noise masking, and after the meditation, I managed to fall asleep.

Later that night, my tinnitus woke me up around 2 AM. It wasn‚Äôt as loud as before, and I was able to fall back asleep much faster.

# My Thoughts on Sleep and Tinnitus

The next day, I reflected on why tinnitus feels louder at night. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just the quiet environment‚Äîit might also be related to **unconscious facial tension** during sleep.

* We clench our jaws, eyes, and temples while sleeping.
* Our posture and even our dreams can contribute to this tension.

This realization led me to make facial relaxation a regular practice. Now, I spend:

* **10 minutes in the morning**
* **10 minutes in the afternoon**
* **15 minutes at night**

This routine has helped me manage my tinnitus to the point where it‚Äôs very faint and much more bearable. I can sleep well and go about my day without constantly noticing it.

# My Observations on Triggers

From my reading and experience, I‚Äôve noticed that several factors can trigger or worsen tinnitus:

1. **Exercise**: While essential for stress management, certain habits during exercise‚Äîlike clenching your jaw, poor posture, or holding your breath‚Äîcan increase facial muscle stress. I‚Äôve found that exercising in the morning or hours before sleep works best for me.
2. **Dehydration**: Dehydration can cause muscle tightness, cramping, and delayed relaxation, all of which seem to make tinnitus worse.
3. **Sugar**: High sugar intake can lead to inflammation and impaired muscle recovery, which may increase stiffness and tension in the jaw and forehead.
4. **Coffee**: Excessive coffee consumption increases cortisol (a stress hormone), which can heighten tension in facial muscles like the jaw and temples. It can also lead to dehydration, further exacerbating muscle tightness.

# Other Things That Have Helped Me

* **Nighttime Baths**: A warm bath before bed relaxes my body and mind, making it easier to unwind.
* **Post-Stress Relaxation**: After stressful tasks, I take 5‚Äì10 minutes for a quick relaxation session to reset.

# What‚Äôs Changed for Me

No, my tinnitus hasn‚Äôt disappeared. And no, I can‚Äôt regrow the hair cells in my inner ear (unfortunately). But I‚Äôve learned to manage it in a way that works for me. Over time, my brain seems to have adapted to these relaxation practices, especially at night. It feels like my body now knows how to release muscle tension on command, which makes a big difference.

# Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre dealing with tinnitus, I encourage you to explore what might work for you. This isn‚Äôt a cure or a one-size-fits-all solution‚Äîjust my personal experience. If you‚Äôre interested, you could start with something simple, like a 10-minute guided facial relaxation session. It might help, or it might not, but for me, it‚Äôs been life-changing.

I'm a freshman college student. I started going to college in September, but moved to the apartment at the end of August. There are four rooms in total.   
The first room belongs to a girl who's been living there for over a year now. She's totally chill, I don't have any issues with her and actually, if every housemate was like her I would not complain. She plays loud music sometimes and such, but it's not that disturbing and it can be easily suppressed with headphones. But she's usually out, since she's got a job.  
The second room is occupied by me and my girlfriend. We're not ideal housemates as we often go to bed very late and we like to chat a lot, but if we were told to sht the fck up, we would just do that.   
Room three belongs to a guy I... I mean, we have an issue with. A big fckin issue. I'll be calling him Shishkebab, since that's the nickname we gave him...  
The room in the back of the apartment used to be occupied by two people in their 20's, they were a pair and they were really nice, but they moved out more than month ago, so the room is now empty.  
Now to the point.  
When we moved in, there seemed to be no big issues besides the unbearable hot temperatures, since it was the end of summer. Besides one thing. The guy from room 3 has been playing his TV hella loud everyday from 5 to 7 PM. But we could've live with that. Then we noticed he doesn't flush the toilet which cause disgusting smell. He doesn't drink anything else besides beer and coffee, which is probably what causes it. Though, not flushing the toilet is disgusting in general. He also doesn't turn off the light at the hallway, which causes me big anxiety. For some reason I can't stand when there are lights on for no reason in a building. Not much longer after we started noticing all of this, he started bringing a girl over. Which was weird. We did not believe he could have a girlfriend suddenly, because he doesn't ever leave his room (he keeps insisting he works 12 hour shifts, but we've never seen him gone for more than 2 hours). We woudln't mind him having a visitor over, but she stayed there for days and we were forced to listen to them fckin every evening. That's something that makes both of us very uncomfortable. I, personally, start panicking. But two times I managed to get up and knock on the wall, so they'd stop.  
I've already learnt my lesson that people hate when they get messages written on paper, but I'm kinda afraid of men and talking to them, especially when I know it can cause a conflict. So I left a paper with a written note for him in the kitchen, which we share. I told him to start flushing the toilet, to put the lights off and to stop having sex when they can't even do it discretely. I also asked him to turn down the volume of the TV a little, since it's been very loud. I want to address that I have no fckin idea of what kind of show? he watches. But it sounds like if he is constantly listening to men yelling. I don't know how else to describe it, it's ridiculous.  
After this, the visitor stopped coming over, which convinced me it really can't be his girlfriend and that he actually invites her only for sex. You know, the walls there are really thin and they've never even spoke together much, which I also found strange, but maybe it's just me.  
He still didn't flush the toilet, neither he stopped letting the lights on. The volume was lowered, but only for few days.   
And thus, autumn and cold days came. And with them, the girl started coming over again. Although I did not hear them fcking, her presence made me very anxious because of the previous experience. Another thing that he started doing was that he always turned on the heating on maximum while we were out. There's a thermostat and he somehow managed to get the temperature in the apartment to 30¬∞C, so everytime we've come back we turned it off and opened the window. But another problem came. Our own room was always cold when we came back, but the heating would not work, because of the thermostat... So we've just have to wait until the next day, when it gets to normal again. He also makes popcorn often and then doesn't even try to open the window, so the whole apartment just smells. Another thing he ""cooks"" is premade lasagna, again, he doesn't open the window in the kitchen after he's finished and so the whole appartment smells as hell. Last time the smell even enetered our room.  
He also doesn't shower. Honestly, I would find that kinda disgusting, but I would not mind as much, but him showering makes me anxious. Because he showers only when he's expecting his... eugh, visitor. And so I know she'll come and she'll occupy all the shared spaces. And that I can expect them having sex.  
Besides not showering, he doesn't wash his clothes. And when he does, he tends to hang the clothes all around the apartment. Including his underwear. It's hella uncomfortable finding someone's underwear on the heating next to the door to your room.   
He probably overheard me sayng something about his poor hygiene and so next day he faked showering and even washing his laundry. He let the washing machine for 3 hours. It was empty. I fckin hate wasting water, I hate when people are doing stupid irrational stuff. I hate it.   
It was Thursday noon, my girlfriend was packing Christmas gift at our room. I was at school. The woman came to the apartment at 11 AM, had sex with him and after an hour left. Now, we were sure this was... weird. We started believing our conclusion that she's a prostitute of some kind.  
Well, me being stupid decided to left him another note. It basically contained the same stuff as before. This time he got really angry and left me a note too. It was full of false accussations, including that we didn't do our monthly cleaning, which I fckin did while he was out for grocery shopping. And so I told the landlord. At first it seemed like this will actually help something, but it didn't. I just wanna mention the fact that when Shishkebab found out about it, he came to me when I was doing the dishes and started being vulgar and agressive towards me.  
We still have to smell his shit, his fckin piss, the fckin popcorn and oh god, don't start on the disgusting lasagna.  
The woman's been coming over every fckin night now. He's apparently left her his keys. So there's a stranger, a fckin prostitute having keys from our apartment in her holding. To someone it could seem weird why would he leave his keys to someone, but as I've said, he doesn't ever leave the apartment, so he simply does not need it. And this way he does not have to get up and go outside to open the gate and everything. We know she's got the keys because she's coming in on her own now. We had our window open yesterday evening after we came back from town and it was fckin uncomfortable when we heard someone opening the gate, while Shishkebab was in his room and we knew it could not possibly be the girl from room one, because she comes back much later. Can you imagine how anxious can one become after some stranger has keys from the place where he lives? A stranger that has nothing to do with that place?  
And of course, they were fcking.  
Today, as it might sound weird, when she was leaving, we decided to watch her from the window. And since today we know 100% there's no fckin way she isn't a prostitute. Why was there a grown ass man in a black car picking her up? I doubt it's her father, who carries her every night here. To a man's place he's probably never seen, because he doesn't go out.  
Jesus, how did I end up at that place I wonder. Why's there no other solution to this than leaving and finding new temporary home? I hate it, I fckin hate him, I just hate him so much, he makes me and my partner so anxious, it doesn't matter how good of a time we're having, he ALWAYS causes the anxiety in us. He's an asshole one can't talk to, because he'll lie to your eyes and he's just a disgusting man in his 30's doing disgusting things. I hate that no one cares, I hate that it seems like people don't believe us or something, because they don't believe there's a grown ass man who does NOTHING and is still capable of paying rent. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND IT EITHER, BUT THERE'S NO WAY OF HIM GOING TO JOB, NEITHER THERE'S A CHANCE OF HIM DOING ANY IT JOB OR SOMETHING FROM HOME, BECAUSE HE'S JUST SO STUPID. I HATE HIM, EVERYTIME I'M COMING BACK TO THE APARTMENT FROM SCHOOL I'M JUST SO ANXIOUS I COULD THROW UP, I CRY EVERY FCKIN DAY AND I CAN'T ANYMORE. I JUST CAN'T.  
I've cried so much today and yesterday, I just can't anymore. I definitely decided to move out, otherwise I would just... just... I don't know. End myself? Most probably. I'm sending the termination of the lease agreement to the landlord tomorrow, because I just can't anymore. I hate that I always feel like throwing up because of one fckin asshole. I hate that I actually like the place otherwise, I hate the fcking landlord so much, I hate it all and can't do anything about it. I just wanted a place to stay, I just wanted a room to share with my beloved one, I just wanted a place to rest, a place to study, a place to relax. But I've got an idiot who ruins my already fcked up mental health. And not only mine, but also my partner's. Which I hate him for even more.   
I'm scared the next place will be the same as this one or even worse. I'm not sure of what will happen, I should be celebrating Christmas which is my favorite holiday, I should be studying for exams, but instead of it I'm crying, sobbing and browsing FaceBook and sites where they offer apartments.

I moved away because my relationship with my parents has always been strained and I've dealt with depression and anxiety since I was a young child and I needed a change. Since I moved my parents have shown no interest in my new life or visiting me even though I wasnt that far away and despite that it hurt I was fine with that. 
Anyway, around Thanksgiving this year, I found out they had gone to Texas to visit another brother (30M) and his family. I decided because they were gone it was the perfect time to go down and get my stuff. Me and SIL got in the truck that my parents had given to us as a gift and drove down. When we got there, we realized they had hired a dog sitter (DS) from their church, and because we didn't want to scare her with our unexpected presence, I called my mom and told her we were stopping by. Even though our relationship is strained, I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying the only reason we were there was because we knew they weren't going to be there, so I made up a story for why we were in town. I even messaged the DS to tell her she didn't need to come by because we had everything taken care of.
The DS showed up around 10:30 pm, after we had been moving boxes and having a few drinks we had brought with us to make the whole experience of going through my childhood belongings a little more fun.
That night and the next morning seemed totally fine. We had coffee with the DS, chatting about dealing with difficult family relationships. At this point me and SIL were going through the garage, the seventh circle of hoarder hell. Rat feces all over my dead grandmother's heirlooms, jewelry boxes chewed through, boxes of family photos used as nesting material. It was so bad I had to go inside and puke.
After we had started loading the truck, DS left. About 30 minutes later, the cops showed up. Apparently the DS had called my parents and said we were ""ransacking the house room by room"" and ""stealing"" from them, which was absolutely not true. This caused my parents who were in Texas to call the local police to report a burglary and criminal trespassing and that we had ""stolen"" the truck, all because I had lied about why we were in town, so they said we had entered under a false pretense. They did not ever call me or SIL to clarify what was going on at any point but they did call my brother 3 hours away to yell at him multiple times. 
The whole time the cops were there, my parents were on the phone ramping them up about the car and that there was a ""burglary in progress"", so the officers were incredibly rude to us even though I had explained the situation multiple times. Eventually the cops left after about 40 minutes, saying that it was a civil matter and not really worth their time. We sat in the truck for hours in the cold waiting for my brother to come get us, intending to leave it there because even though we know we hadn't ""stolen"" it, it didn't feel right to drive it back up and be accused of something we didn't do. Because the truck was the only functional car we had on the farm at the time, my brother had to ask a friend for a ride in his truck to get to us. 
While we were sitting there, after about 2 and a half hours, DS and her retired cop dad came to the house, while on the phone with my parents, climbing into the back of the truck and going through the boxes on FaceTime while we were sitting in the cab. When we confronted them, the dad immediately threatened to call the cops on us for trespassing even though we're sitting in a car on a public street waiting for our ride. He continued to berate us so we drove to a well-lit grocery store parking lot right next to the sheriff station less than two minutes away. Finally my brother got to us and we loaded everything up and left our parents truck at the house.

1hixrnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1hixrnc/aita_my_parents_accused_me_of_burglary_for/,AITA- My Parents Accused Me of Burglary for Grabbing My Own Stuff,"I (23F) moved out of my parents hoarder house a little less than a year ago to move in with my brother (43M) and SIL (45F) on a beautiful farm in the PNW about 3 hours away from my parents. I moved away because my relationship with my parents has always been strained and I've dealt with depression and anxiety since I was a young child and I needed a change. Since I moved my parents have shown no interest in my new life or visiting me even though I wasnt that far away and despite that it hurt I was fine with that. 
Anyway, around Thanksgiving this year, I found out they had gone to Texas to visit another brother (30M) and his family. I decided because they were gone it was the perfect time to go down and get my stuff. Me and SIL got in the truck that my parents had given to us as a gift and drove down. When we got there, we realized they had hired a dog sitter (DS) from their church, and because we didn't want to scare her with our unexpected presence, I called my mom and told her we were stopping by. Even though our relationship is strained, I didn't want to hurt her feelings by saying the only reason we were there was because we knew they weren't going to be there, so I made up a story for why we were in town. I even messaged the DS to tell her she didn't need to come by because we had everything taken care of.
The DS showed up around 10:30 pm, after we had been moving boxes and having a few drinks we had brought with us to make the whole experience of going through my childhood belongings a little more fun.
That night and the next morning seemed totally fine. We had coffee with the DS, chatting about dealing with difficult family relationships. At this point me and SIL were going through the garage, the seventh circle of hoarder hell. Rat feces all over my dead grandmother's heirlooms, jewelry boxes chewed through, boxes of family photos used as nesting material. It was so bad I had to go inside and puke.
After we had started loading the truck, DS left. About 30 minutes later, the cops showed up. Apparently the DS had called my parents and said we were ""ransacking the house room by room"" and ""stealing"" from them, which was absolutely not true. This caused my parents who were in Texas to call the local police to report a burglary and criminal trespassing and that we had ""stolen"" the truck, all because I had lied about why we were in town, so they said we had entered under a false pretense. They did not ever call me or SIL to clarify what was going on at any point but they did call my brother 3 hours away to yell at him multiple times. 
The whole time the cops were there, my parents were on the phone ramping them up about the car and that there was a ""burglary in progress"", so the officers were incredibly rude to us even though I had explained the situation multiple times. Eventually the cops left after about 40 minutes, saying that it was a civil matter and not really worth their time. We sat in the truck for hours in the cold waiting for my brother to come get us, intending to leave it there because even though we know we hadn't ""stolen"" it, it didn't feel right to drive it back up and be accused of something we didn't do. Because the truck was the only functional car we had on the farm at the time, my brother had to ask a friend for a ride in his truck to get to us. 
While we were sitting there, after about 2 and a half hours, DS and her retired cop dad came to the house, while on the phone with my parents, climbing into the back of the truck and going through the boxes on FaceTime while we were sitting in the cab. When we confronted them, the dad immediately threatened to call the cops on us for trespassing even though we're sitting in a car on a public street waiting for our ride. He continued to berate us so we drove to a well-lit grocery store parking lot right next to the sheriff station less than two minutes away. Finally my brother got to us and we loaded everything up and left our parents truck at the house. 
I'm curious, especially for parents, if this reaction was warranted. So, AITA?",1,1734740400.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I dropped my wife off at work (she works at an elementary school) and as she left the car, she realized she forgot her phone.

Keep in mind, this is the last day of school before winter break.

No worries, I told her, I'll bring it by.

I went back to the house, had a cup of coffee, found her phone (thank you ""Find My Device"") and headed back out.

Today, there was a big assembly at her school.  Lots of parents were parking / driving around looking to attend.  Parking was insane, as was traffic.

No big deal, I decided to let things calm down and decided to buy my lovely bride some flowers and a balloon for her at the supermarket nearby.

Her birthday is December 24th, so I usually do something a week or so out just because.

Anyways, I found a nice arraignment, and decided to add a balloon.  I had left my glasses in the car, so I grabbed what I though said ""Happy Birthday!""

Paid for the flowers and balloon, and went back to the car.  Then I put my glasses on.

The balloon said ""Happy Thanksgiving"" in a very fancy script.  Not ""Happy Birthday.""

Well, crap.

Thanksgiving has passed.

At first, I figured that I could cross out ""thanksgiving"" with sharpie and write ""birthday.""  Alas, I had no sharpie.

Then I thought I could explain it in the card.  I quickly realized I would never live this down.  For context, I once grabbed my wife a lovely card that was for ""from mom to my son.""

Wasn't doin' that again.

So, I ditched the card.  Saw a lady with a kid and gave the little one the balloon.   Sadly, she had a second child with her that got upset.

Not wanting to end up on Facebook as a local monster, I gave the bigger kid a dollar coin.  I looked at the mom and said, ""I just forgot my glasses.  I hope this didn't make a mess"" as she laughed at me and went into the store.

Still, I could show up on the internet as ""confused old guy gave my baby an outdated balloon and my oldest money.""

My wife loved the flowers, and the story.  I may be a dumbass, but I'm her dumbass.

TL;DR: Forgot my glasses, misread a balloon, and just created a whole, silly thing.  Wife loved the flowers, and the story, however.  Still feel like a dummy.",39,1734740257.0,tifu,7,0.88,False

I typically need 10 hours of sleep a night to be well rested but even if I go to sleep at 10pm, I will not be able to wake up before 1pm the next day and that makes it 15hours of sleep, which is way too much.

In turn, that leads to a lot of guilt and self-loathing for not waking up at least a bit earlier.

The few times I forced myself to get up in the actual morning, I completely shut down and could not physically get up from the couch before the afternoon, it's beginning to take a toll on my mental and physical health (because I eat less meal since I wake up so late, which is making me lose a lot of weight at an alarming rate). 

I was wondering if anyone ever experienced this and if you have any advice for me ?

Long story short, I got my start in roleplaying back during the golden age of AOL and Yahoo (anyone else remember the Red Dragon Inn back in the late 90s and early 2000s?). Ah, those were the days, right? When the biggest worry was your dial-up connection, haha.

As I'm sure you'd all agree‚Äîfinding long-term, advanced/literate writers is much more challenging these days. I have fond memories of when the process of coming up with a plot was an organic process; where you'd genuinely take the time to get to know the other person, build rapport, and allow a plot to form naturally.

That's what I'm hoping to find. With that said, I put a lot of effort into this post, so hopefully there's someone else out there who values the same things in a writing partner!

**First of all, here's a bit about me as a person:**

* I'm 30+, male, and I've written several novels and a bunch of articles, mostly in historical fiction and contemporary stories. Writing isn't just my job; it's pretty much a part of who I am.
* I'm always trying to learn something new, whether it's from books, documentaries, or just good old chatting. History and cultures fascinate me the most.
* When I'm not buried in books or work, I love to hike and take photos. There‚Äôs something about being out in nature that just clears my head.
* I love to read (especially non-fiction and historical fiction). I'm always down for swapping book recommendations, if you're also a reader!
* I love peanut butter (crunchy over smooth any day ‚Äì fight me).
* On that note, if I'm being honest, coffee isn't just a drink for me; it's a ritual!
* I'm a big fan of the simple things in life. Give me a sunset, a good laugh, or a perfect slice of pizza, and I‚Äôm set.
* I love diving into those deep, meandering conversations that start with ""what if"" and end somewhere between ""the meaning of life"" and ""why can‚Äôt we tickle ourselves?""
* Fun fact: I used to be able to recite all 50 states in alphabetical order ‚Äî a party trick born out of a grade school challenge, haha.

**Here's what I'm looking for in a writer:**

* ***Writing Style -*** I'm looking for a partner who has a strong command of the English language. I'm talking about descriptive passages that paint clear pictures, dialogue that is crisp, concise, and not overly flowery. I prefer to write in the 3rd person, past tense. I prefer modern fiction and historical fiction stories.
* ***Communication -***  Life's unpredictable! What‚Äôs important is keeping each other in the loop about our schedules and any changes in the story or our approach. A quick heads-up can make a huge difference. It's all about being honest and direct with our feedback and thoughts.
* ***Long-Term Plots -*** I'm really looking for a writing partner who's in it for the long haul and is passionate about crafting intricate, plot-driven stories. For me, the joy of roleplaying lies in developing a story that evolves over time, with twists and turns that keep us both engaged and inspired.
* ***Sense of Humor -*** Writing together should be fun and relaxed, not just a serious crafting of narratives. It‚Äôs important to me that we can both throw in a bit of humor now and then, not only in our stories but in our interactions too.

And there you have it! If you're a detail-oriented, communicative, mature, and long-term story lover, you might just be the writing partner I'm looking for.

We should totally write such a good story that our keyboards will need a vacation after we're done, haha. I hope to hear from you!",2,1734739633.0,Roleplay,0,1.0,False

The incessant buzz of people and traffic, the back and forth of secretaries and student council members, Rinny nagging me like she would child and to top it all off, the clock taunting me with every jocular minute and fucking second that passes. Doctors recommend at least 8 hours of sleep for people my age, hopefully I get a fraction of this number on a good day. If I could, I'd shoot myself five times in the temple and sleep until the next century or the next world, whichever comes first. Drooling over my papers is not an option, but the degeneration of my cognitive abilities is such that grabbing a cup of coffee is a Herculean task. The only kind side to this whole situation is how curious the simplest geometry comes to look to the untrained eye as distortions and macabre brushstrokes. The world unravels like a ball of wool or ill-kept parchment, colored outside the lines or with fuzzy strokes, perception itself becomes watercolor. Just watch as my chair bounces and rocks like a ship capsizing and transforms as my studio blurs, little by little and it turns, oh it turns! Like the merry-go-round, like a slide down into the unknown, I embrace this feeling of emptiness as if from this place I were native.....

I come back to myself, dry mouth and eyes suffering from an invisible hand behind me gripping them with unspeakable violence making the escape from the arms of Morpheus an unpleasant procedure as always. A faint strut under my folder, almost a hum to the rhythm of a metronome barely reaches my ears while I feel a strange dampness and cold breeze between my legs... dampness, water, thirst is what I have! All rational thought is thrown out the window for a glass of water, there's a cooler somewhere in the office and even though Rinny has banned sodas and beers, a good bottle of water is the only thing I need.

Suddenly, I notice a knock and a yelp against my table, like a doorstop creaking and protesting against a rebellious door. I hurriedly look downwards in confusion, wondering if sleep deprivation can cause auditory hallucinations of this level before a sharp pain completely awakens me. The dull humid breaths and titillating pleasure from before are now completely gone, all but the pulsating flesh and beating my aching member below the table as the humidity evaporates into a hot breath and a cold breeze hits my nethers.

‚ÄúJust holding it in your mouth while looking cute won‚Äôt do it as a punishment though. Handling horns like this is fun though, would it be a turnoff if I made motorcycleüèçüèçüèçüèçüèçüèç noises while she gags on my pickle?‚ÄúüòÅ

She coughs and sputters on my Binah, dangerously approaching her teeth to my flesh. All of the sudden, she composes herself and looks up with the determined feisty look I am accustomed to from her, stars sparkling from her eyes and her cap flying off. Danger alarms flare in my now fully awakened brain. She starts sucking with determination and moxie now, stimulating my tired neurons once more in a mixture of pain and delight with her head almost completely hilted between my legs.

Between gurgling and sucking onomatopeias and animated interjections I gather that Chiaki has finally found the topic she had looked for for so long to write about. The teen girls of Kivotos will swoon over this, the readership will grow exponentially, she said. The Pandemonium Society will be elated, she said (they won‚Äôt once Hina catches wind of this).

If I don‚Äôt become the topic for the next Pandemo Weekly I will surely at least be the main topic on the medical journals of Kivotos and give Sena the privilege of a nice graduating thesis. Always aim for the top I guess.

I‚Äôm not just a spark of attraction. I‚Äôm the full package. I won‚Äôt go home with you when I‚Äôve had too much to drink. I‚Äôll wait till you muster the maturity for a coffee date. I‚Äôm not just a fun night one night, I deserve someone who sees me wholeheartedly, someone who can offer true connection. 

My love is patient, my love is caring, and my love is mine. I‚Äôll call the cab and sit silent in the back, I‚Äôm too good for flings and toxic encounters. My passion is palpable, yet I contain it to my stage. I won‚Äôt give it up so easily to seduction and pretty words. I love myself and I‚Äôll take my time with the next person. I won‚Äôt lean in until the waters are warm. I won‚Äôt dive in until we‚Äôve weathered the storm. Even then I‚Äôll hold my breath, because I know the passion of one evening is matched with the compassion of the next morning.

My love is large, it will boost you up onto its shoulders and minimize your every weakness. To a place where I dwell in its warm embrace.  My love will rise and flow into its nesting place. I won‚Äôt give in to falsehoods of lust and greed, because I have everything I need.

There‚Äôs nobody here who‚Äôs ready to rise, to journey into the unknown with me. They all lie and assume to the things they say are true simply because they said them. I won‚Äôt break my own heart again to feel the warm embrace of another, I‚Äôll cuddle with them under the covers. My love is patient and they must be too, it‚Äôs not safe until these things they can prove. Respecting my boundaries and taking it slow. I‚Äôm built to last and wired to grow. 

This garden of love where exes have trampled, cutting the stems before harvesting ample. They loved what they got, it was only a sample. They grew impatient, and I never blamed them. But did they ever show grace in the face my darkness? 

I don‚Äôt search for a lover so perfect, one molded and sculpted by ghosts ghouls and phantoms. I‚Äôm an artist and they are my canvas, through patience and consistency my love is never random. The world is a mystery, I know not who I am, I follow my heart and I do what I can. All that I ask is that a lover who wants me comes as they are and believes that they can too.

I live now in a new position. To inspire and spread my knowledge is my calling. But I‚Äôm not perfect, and did you not know?? When my ugliness rears its head on the other side is a better version of the man you fell in love with. It‚Äôs better this way, I‚Äôm always refining. My comfort and saftey all in divine timing.

It was sending power to the motor but the motor didnt move. The wire got as warm as a mug of coffee. Maybe the motor and/or wire got overheated by this event. I don't know. I strongly suspect the wire took some heat damage and increased in resistance but I'm not an expert in electric motors.

* before the issue my motorpower would only start decreasing at 85% rpm
* now the motorpower already start decreasing at 75% rpm and cuts off completely at 90%

But since my bike shop is going to replace the motor next month anyway and doesn't believe something could be wrong with the wires, I have this question. Is it possible and likely that my decreased topspeed is simply caused by increased resistance in the wire?

* Suppose the controller sends 40v 10a to the motor
* Suppose the wire has 0.1 ohm
* Then the motor should receive 39v which has direct relationship with its topspeed.
* For math simplicity let's say that the motor kV is 1 so voltage = rpm so this means 39rpm.\]
* Wire heat loss is 10¬≤.1 = 10w
* Now suppose the wire has 1 ohm: the voltage drop is 10 and the motor only receives 30v
* Topspeed is 30rpm
* Wire heat loss is 10¬≤1 = 100w

Wouldn't this perfectly explain my topspeed issue? Is this likely to be the case or do i not understand how motors work?",1,1734737770.0,ebikes,0,1.0,False

1hiwvbi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hiwvbi,$690 Private Room Available from January 6 - April 30,"Hi! I am looking for a Carleton University or Algonquin College student (preferably male) to sublease a single room in a shared house from January 6th to April 30th since I have accepted an offer to live on residence at the university. You will have the option to extend the lease if you want after April 2025. The rent is $690 per month and it includes everything including wifi. Since you will be moving in January 6th, the rent for that month will be lower (we can discuss this if you are interested in subleasing).

LOCATION
The house is located on Mulvagh Avenue which is a quiet neighbourhood. The 2 prominent bus stops are only a 3 minute walk down the street (111 Carleton/Baseline and 86 Tunney‚Äôs Pasture/Baseline). It takes only 1 bus to go to Carleton University or Algonquin College which makes this a perfect place for students! There are grocery stores (No Frills, Freshco‚Ä¶), coffee shops, restaurants and banks which are 10 minutes away by walking on Merivale Road.

ROOM DETAILS
It is a single spacious room with a big window and a big closet. The room will come with a bed frame, desk, nightstand, and dresser. I bought a new mattress and comfy office chair in September 2024 (very new) and will be selling these so, you can purchase these from me if you wish and complete the bedroom. Please see the images attached.

SHARED SPACES DETAILS
You will be sharing 1.5 bathrooms with 3 male students. You will have access to a kitchen, dining room, and living room and you will be sharing this with 4 male students (one tenant lives in the basement and has his own bathroom). There are 2 big fridges and a microwave for everyone to share. The other tenants rarely use the dining and living room and the kitchen is moderately used. There is a washer and a dryer in the basement for everyone‚Äôs use. The tenants all have a cleaning agreement where one person is assigned to clean the shared spaces once a week. Parking is available if needed. There are lots of unused storage spaces in the basement, upstairs closet and dining area.

IMPORTANT NOTES
The current tenants of this house are all students who prefer a quiet and clean living space. So, we are looking for someone who has the same values. The landlord would like last month‚Äôs rent and a signed letter from a guarantor. 

I am available to do showings only on certain days since I will be in the East end of the city for the holidays. So, please ONLY reach out if you are serious about renting this place.

I live in Kansas City, but I've spent most of my life in the NYC metro. I moved here in 2015 for a great job, and I've been here since. I live alone in a nice, modern home in the South Hyde Park area. I love living inside the city and don't see myself living far away from an urban area.

I'm handsome, slim, and in great shape. I have deep, dark eyes and dark hair peppered with greys. I keep my facial hair short and well-groomed. I don't currently have any tattoos or piercings.

I pass regular background checks due to my job so you know I'm not shady. I have no debt or unpaid bills. I'm not addicted to anything. I don't need to be taught basic adult skills like how to care for myself or my home. You won't have to pick up after me or take an overwhelming share of the mental load. I've even kept my plants alive for years! Hopefully, you've got stability and minimal drama in your life. Ideally, you're independent and have a job that you enjoy. 

Politically, I'm a very passionate progressive/liberal. If you have some ""conservative"" values, that may not necessarily be a source of conflict. However, if you're a supporter of the modern Republican party and the MAGA movement, we are not a good fit. I'm not a religious person, but it is okay if you are as long as you can accept that I am not. Lastly, I do not have children and would prefer to date someone without children or whose kids are older and independent.

Except for a fulfilling relationship with a loving partner, I have a happy and comfortable life that doesn't want for anything. I'm capable, confident, independent, and have my life together. I want to meet someone with the intent of developing an enduring relationship. We can proceed at a pace that makes sense for us.

-------------------------
**Some things I enjoy:**

* **Food**: I have a very adventurous palate and love trying new foods. I avoid eating at the same restaurant twice to force myself to broaden my food experiences. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, that's fine! I'm open to the idea of some version of vegetarianism myself. I'm a competent cook, but I don't enjoy cooking. I'd prefer a partner who does. I promise that I'm great at doing the dishes and cleaning up in the kitchen.

* **Fitness**: My health is important, especially as I get older. I exercise regularly and also run. I'd love someone who prioritizes their health and fitness as well.

* **Coffee**: My COVID project was learning to appreciate coffee. My home ""cafe"" looks like a meth lab. I love it. I'll make you a great, fresh cup of pour-over in the morning. 

* **Riding**: I own a modern-retro scooter (a la Vespa) and enjoy riding it around the city. Don't worry, you do not need to get on the scooter if you don't want to. I promise I ride safely and with proper gear, and never speed or get on the highway.

* **Therapy**: I have been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and I'm finding it invaluable. After my previous relationships failed, I felt it was important to work on myself and set up future relationships for success. I think everyone would benefit from therapy at various points in their life.

* **Politics**: I'm a ""political junkie"". I frequently read articles and listen to podcasts. I also have a great deal of interest in the Supreme Court.

* **Movies**: I'm a huge cinephile and enjoy going to the theater. 

* **Music**: I love live music. I'm tolerant of most genres but gravitate towards indie, pop, and EDM. I like discovering new music, so if you want to share something you're vibing to and think I might like it, please share it with me.

* **Gaming**: I love to play board games with a group or my partner. I especially like games that involve some sort of social component and intuition, like The Resistance. Going out for trivia nights at bars is also one of my favorite things to do. I sometimes play single-player video games that allow me to stop at any time.

* **Cleanliness**: I'm probably the tidiest man you'll ever meet. I keep both my home and myself tidy. I'm something of a minimalist as well. I am not a big fan of collecting tons of trinkets and knickknacks and would not do well with a hoarder.

* **Drugs**: I have no dependencies or addictions whatsoever. I only drink socially and in moderation. I don't smoke *anything*, and I don't want to date someone who smokes a lot of anything. It smells gross and makes you taste gross. I sometimes enjoy a low-dose edible or a psychedelic. It's okay with me if you casually enjoy alcohol, marijuana, or ""lighter"" drugs more often than I do. 

* **Traveling**: I'm more of a homebody, but I like road trips. I want to drive across the country in a camper someday. I enjoy hiking and ""glamping"", but don't love prolonged camping. I would be agreeable to traveling far and wide with a partner.

It is perfectly fine if you don't share all my interests. I want you to be your own person with your own passions. As long as we align on our core values and ideals, the rest is not all that important.

------------
Please be serious about meeting in person. I don't want to text endlessly. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to me via chat or Reddit mail (preferred). **Please include a picture of your face with your message and describe yourself physically**. It's not much different than if we were on a dating app. I **will** ask for a picture if you didn't include one to start. Being weird about this would lead me to believe you're not serious and I'll likely move on.

------------
If you're **long-distance** (i.e. more than 2 hours away) and still interested, feel free to message me, but *only if* you're willing to make an actual effort to meet me in person after chatting for a bit. Ideally, you're in a position where you'll be able to relocate to Kansas City to live with me in a hypothetical future in which we're both committed to one another.

I told her that if she could be downstairs getting coffee for an hour over doing her rounds on time then she could deal with being behind on her own. She got mad at me and said that was rude and selfish of me. She tried to tell me that I had to help her since I was ‚Äòsitting on my ass‚Äô and I said I was sitting down because I had already done everything for my assigned patients. She ended up storming out of the room to tell the charge nurse, saying that I was refusing to take care of a patient because they weren‚Äôt assigned to me. I tried to explain why I was upset by the request but charge wouldn‚Äôt hear it. Long story short, I got yelled at, got all the call lights on the floor directed to me all night so I didn‚Äôt have a single other chance to sit down, and the night shift charge told our nurse manager that I needed to be written up for insubordination. I didn‚Äôt get a write up since it was my first offense but I did have to have a meeting with our manager over it. I was told that I can‚Äôt ever deny patient care requests since, ultimately, the patient is the one who suffers and goes without care while we argue. I‚Äôm not denying that statement, but isn‚Äôt the CNA who isn‚Äôt taking care of patients assigned to her the bigger problem here? Oh, and I was told I had to go clean her patient up for her by the charge nurse that night or I could go home and she‚Äôd call house supervisor to let them know I quit. I gave in, and the CNA came in the room and got the patient‚Äôs vitals while I was cleaning them.

The next night I worked, the same night shift charge nurse told me that I needed to apologize to the other CNA for the way I treated her and that I needed to do it in front of her so she could witness. I refused. I told her I would not be offering an apology, and that I‚Äôd like the subject dropped since I already spoke to the nurse manager about it.

Now I‚Äôm not claiming to be the most warm-hearted person after years of the healthcare grind, but AITA? Should I really apologize to the other tech after she caused herself to be behind by spending more than an hour on a coffee run?",3,1734737466.0,AmItheAsshole,9,1.0,False

My mom was sobbing about how I called her a hoarder and just ranting about how ""abusive"" I was.  When I asked her why she invited me if she feels so strongly about me she said it was an intervention. 

Yes I called her a hoarder. Because my parents were evicted for hoarding. I paid for 6 months of hotels for them.  I took a month off work to try and clean their home enough hoping that they wouldn't get evicted. 

The ""treasures"" I tossed were dried bottles of finger paint, 50+ empty coffee bags that she was saving as a gift for me to use for arts and crafts, over 300 stuffed animals that mice had ripped apart and pooped all over. 

She can make the living area of her home presentable by mounding everything into the guest rooms and basement. Not even in boxes, just straight heaps of random crap. 

Of course my cousins thought I was being abusive, never mind I got $20k in debt to try and save my parents from something that could have been prevented by simply cleaning up after themselves like adults. I am not their parent. I should not be going into debt because they are lazy. 

I guess I will not be seeing my extended family again. Since they are so quick to side with mom without even asking my side. All they see is her ""lovely home"" and a heartbroken crying mom. ",7,1734736970.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I finished my graduation in 2022 and started working in my current role since September 2023. I‚Äôm usually not the best chatter. School exhausts me too much to hold a conversation but then again when I do, I either would try to get to know the person or their day to the extent to which they interested in sharing such when we‚Äôre on lunch break and or ugh on the bus. Anyway this Christmas I gave everyone a card (I wrote each one a personalised message inside) and had some treats in the classroom where our team could enjoy them, and then I even went to the extent of buying coffee pods for my line manager and the principal (I mean these two helped me a lot to apply for my visa and in the recent meeting I had with them, I communicated that I wanted to be train internally before I apply for Assessment only QTS and they were again very supportive) which obviously our team doesn‚Äôt know about. I mean even when I had to leave a present, I‚Äôm so awkward that I just left it on their desks so I don‚Äôt have to be there for them to thank me for it that‚Äôs how awkward I am. When I left school today I left with bags of presents from kids while they got none, but even before they saw me with a bag of presents some people are erm a little less friendly. I‚Äôve been out with the staffs a couple of times- to sum up the highlights of each night out of drink, once I went out, I shared embarrassing videos on the group (I guess that was not funny I realised it later- since people are grown ups, they let themselves loose and don‚Äôt want to look at it later. In my country we‚Äôd make fun of them for days so I didn‚Äôt get that), another time I was a bit too drunk and dropped a few glasses and fell once and the third time (and this is solely with my team) I was on my third drink and I was loud and they were very judgey. In my point of view when you‚Äôre comfortable with people, you try to relax but I guess I‚Äôm starting to become this person who‚Äôs the weirdo who cannot handle a drink, cannot hold a conversation or at least I don‚Äôt have anything to add about kids, grandkids, family since I‚Äôm away from home and got nothing new happening, nothing or no colleague to back bitch about- I‚Äôm easy maybe I‚Äôm the colleague they back bitch about.

1hiwk6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hiwk6l/navigating_fathers_death_postdeconstruction/,Navigating father's death post-deconstruction,"I've been struggling with navigating my father's death after he passed away last month. My dad was pretty ill in the last few years and had lung issues after dealing with really bad bouts of pneumonias and COVID. So his death wasn't really a surprise technically but it was still shocking because he'd just started palliative care. I already deal with a lot of resentment towards the church so dealing with them while preparing for my dads funeral was upsetting. Especially because my dads ward basically ignored my parents, didn't bring them sacrament to the home despite the fact they'd promised too, since my dads health issues basically kept him bed ridden. And when my brother and I tried to get the church set up for the funeral we were told by the bishop that if we wanted to specifically have an open mic service for him, we couldn't have in the actual chapel, it'd have to be in the Relief Society or Priesthood room. The bishop told my brother it was apparently to prevent people from coming up and sharing ""non doctrinal"" thoughts. What?? Testimony meeting open mics are fine but not people coming up to share memories of my dad? I also generally just hate how most funerals always try to push an emphasis on the church versus discussing the person who passed. We lucked out and the service was beautiful with people coming up and sharing stories of my dad, but the whole PR cooperation-like attitude and structure of the church is infuriating to me. 

I'm also just right now struggling in opening up about my grief. I was of course raised in the stereotypical ""don't be sad they're in a happy place"" environment but now I no longer have that sense of certainty anymore. I find myself just feeling like I'm in a constant state of shock, watching as my in-laws give me brief condolences in text and then move on as if life is fine and normal for the holidays. Meanwhile I feel like I've just got a big empty void and a feeling of sadness and anger. Because if God is real or some other higher being-- why did my dad have to have his health slowly decline in the most painful way possible? And I had to watch him cognitively decline as well as he grew more and more fearful of the ""last days"" and making sure the family was being active and faithful, and  unfortunately it pushed my brother and I away from wanting to talk to him about religion. In fact one of the last time my brother talked to my dad, it waa an disagreemement about religion since my brother isn't active. 

 I feel like I can't talk to people about it who are active because they just bring up the talking points of "" he's doing the work up there"" or "" he's not in pain anymore."" I know people are trying to help but I just get so frustrated hearing that sort of stuff. And whenever I've tried to talk to my husband he somehow turns my lack of faith against me, as if its worst thing in the world I don't fully believe my dad is Mormon heaven. Realistically, I don't know what really happens after we die but all I know is I want my dad back and I now know even more that me drinking coffee or tea or occasionally swearing means absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things. Because I had to see my dads body and have it hit me that were here for a bit and then gone. My husband also had the audacity to tell me he disapproves of my coffee drinking after our discussion had originally started as me crying about my dad's death..ah yes I clearly want to discuss our marriage right now and how I'm such a disappointment for not wearing garments and drinking coffee. 

Sorry for the long rant, I'm just tired of the Mormon culture around grief. I just want to be sad for a while without pretending everything is ok. :(",6,1734736751.0,exmormon,1,1.0,False

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it‚Äôs you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength‚ÄîI wish I‚Äôd had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There‚Äôs so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it‚Äôs not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian‚Äîyour mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she‚Äôs gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I‚Äôve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I‚Äôm certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup‚Äôs rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn‚Äôt know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you‚Äôll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea‚Äôs trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, ‚ÄúW-what does this mean?‚Äù

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. ‚ÄúNot here, not now. Let‚Äôs get home, then we can talk.‚Äù

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother‚Äôs shrill voice called after them, ‚ÄúLeaving already? You haven‚Äôt stayed for lunch.‚Äù

Sorin‚Äôs jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.‚Äù With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. ‚ÄúDamn it, damn it, damn it.‚Äù

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea‚Äôs gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

‚ÄúD-do you‚Ä¶ think this could really be true?‚Äù Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. ‚ÄúLook, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might‚Äôve signed, we‚Äôll have proof.‚Äù He paused, deep in thought. ‚ÄúDad must have something lying around.‚Äù A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. ‚ÄúWhy did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could‚Äôve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!‚Äù

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. ‚ÄúWe‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt really know what was going on back then‚Ä¶‚Äù

A sob erupted from him. ‚ÄúI loved him so much, Drea. I don‚Äôt remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end‚Ä¶‚Äù

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another‚Äôs embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, ‚ÄúCall Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.‚Äù

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn‚Äôt rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it! That woman is going to pay today. I‚Äôve tolerated her long enough!‚Äù He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

‚ÄúAdrian, no!‚Äù

- I still eat sushi (some cooked, some raw). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not doing this daily but when I do go to a sushi spot I‚Äôll still get my raw salmon roll. It‚Äôs gotta be a really reputable spot. I‚Äôm not getting sushi from a grocery store. 
- I eat TOASTED Italian subs. I do feel guilty about this sometimes. So I do double toast it. I have the deli toast it and I toast it a bit more in my air fryer. I don‚Äôt do this a lot but I only eat this when my craving is absolutely unbearable. 
- I eat kimchi. I love kimchi. I eat This every day. I‚Äôm asian so I‚Äôve seen my parents and aunts and other older relatives eat this during their pregnancies. It helps with my constipation too.  
- I drink coffee more than once a day. So much research really shows that it takes sooooo much to really have issues. 

These are the things I absolutely don‚Äôt do;
1) Eat tuna, raw or cooked (and other large fishes) due to Mercury content.
2) Eat raw oysters. I love love raw oysters but the risk of contamination is too high at the moment. If I lived right next to the bay, I might dabble but because the oysters I would end up eating where I‚Äôm at require it to be transported it just really increases the risk.
3) Smoke/eat cannabis. I‚Äôm a huge pot head so this is always the hardest thing for me. As much as I am a huge advocate for cannabis  a medicine, the lack of proper studies is what makes me hesitant. 
4) smoke cigarettes. I quit on Nov 2022 and don‚Äôt ever plan to go back but also, it‚Äôs just really stupid to do that. Come on people 
5) eat salad/greens from restaurants. I‚Äôve gotten sick from doing this many times, just not willing to risk it while pregnant. 
6) Drink alcohol. There are too many studies that show the harm. I think having 1 seltzer or glass of wine towards the end isn‚Äôt enough to harm your fetus/baby but for me it just wasn‚Äôt something I really cared to do. Plus I‚Äôm not a big drinker to begin with. 

The reason I‚Äôm posting this is so that other preggos who may feel the same as me won‚Äôt feel alone. Plus, we listen and we don‚Äôt judge üòè

EDIT:
Just to add, as I remembered‚Ä¶

- I still take my steak rare. But I eat ground beef medium well.
- I continue to take my eggs sunny side up. 

EDIT 2:
Regarding kimchi. I put that on the list because I‚Äôve recently been called out by two moms on two separate occasions when I did this. I was so confused so I googled it and saw a few articles that fear mongered you into thinking this is bad. It‚Äôs not, but I figured maybe some parents have dealt with the same issue as me.",66,1734735650.0,pregnant,74,0.81,False

Never thought I'd be posting about workplace romance, but here we are! I actively avoided dating medics throughout uni to keep personal and professional lives separate. Well, that principle lasted exactly 4 months into FY1 üôÉ

There's this IMT1 who's just... different. She's incredibly competent, has this infectious smile and laugh that lights up the doctors' office, and genuinely makes every shift better. We've had great chats during quieter moments, and I get a flutter every time she smiles at me or says my name. I find myself looking forward to the days when we're on the same side of the ward, and I've definitely volunteered for extra jobs just to spend more time around her.

While she hasn't given obvious ""I'm interested"" signals, there's definitely something there. She always finds reasons to chat with me during breaks and remembers random details from our conversations. I already have her number from WhatsApp (we're in the same work group), which makes things a bit easier. Usually, I'm pretty confident about expressing interest in women outside of work, but the professional dynamic here makes it trickier.

The main challenge is that she's technically more senior, and we work together regularly on the same ward. I don't want to make things awkward if she's not interested, but also... life's short, right? 

Has anyone here successfully dated someone more senior? Any tips on how to test the waters without making things weird if it doesn't work out? I'm thinking of maybe suggesting a casual coffee after shift one day, but would love to hear from others who've navigated this successfully.

Edit: And before anyone asks - yes, I'm absolutely sure this isn't just the ""omg someone's nice to me at work"" syndrome that we all get as FY1s üòÖ I've been around long enough to know the difference!",5,1734735253.0,doctorsUK,9,0.73,False
