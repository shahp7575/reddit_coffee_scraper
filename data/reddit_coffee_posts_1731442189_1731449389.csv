This is sort of a repost, since a couple years ago I managed to find a fantastic group who I'm still playing with. But as the horrors of the real world persist, so must my escape into *imagination*. 

**WHO**  
A little about me: 40+ year old writer who doesn't look a day over 39 and I've been playing/DMing D&D for just a little longer than Stranger Things has existed. I moved to LA right before the pandemic hit and while I have a handful of great friends here, working from home means I don't have as much opportunity to meet new folks. I'm an avid listener of NADDPod and watcher of Dimension 20 and have been hankering for an in-person game with that level of shenaniganry.

Despite being a cishet white male, I'm in the minority amongst my friends so I very much welcome & *prefer* a diverse crowd. \[LGBTQ+ Friendly\]\[POC Friendly\] etc. and if the thought of any of that bothers you, kindly look for another table. Also I don't much care about age but I've only done 1 tiktok dance so skewing \~30+ probably makes sense.

I'm down to DM (and have a fair amount of experience) with the caveat that there could be some switching in the future. Bonus: I've got the Legendary Bundle and a Master subscription on D&DBeyond so we have access to, like, everything. Incentive to be my friend! Just like in middle school.

**WHAT**  
D&D 5e (likely 2024). If folks feel strongly about a published adventure/setting (official or not), I'm game. Otherwise if it's something I'm running I'd like to do a bit of mishmash homebrew that's on the lighthearted side (Obojima perhaps??). Not that it will be without stakes and danger, but I get enough grimdark IRL. 

**WHERE**  
I'm willing to host at my place in North Hollywood/Studio City area. It's not a huge space but it's worked in the past with a full group. Worst case scenario, Geeky Teas is just a short ride away.

**WHEN**  
Weekday evenings and/or weekends. Pretty open right now so we can tackle the Scheduling Demon later but I'd like to kick off a session zero this month over some drinks or coffee.

1gpwmjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1gpwmjv/my_husband_cheated_on_me/,My husband cheated on me,"Hello! My husband and I have been together for 6.5 years, married for 1.5 years. He's 29, I'm 30. Last Friday, he sat down with me after morning coffee and announced that he felt he couldn't fulfill himself with me and that he had fallen out of love with me, which was a long process. He then announced that he cheated on me with one of his colleagues, who is 10 years older than him, and that she also has a child. Since then, I haven't regained consciousness, I'm having a wave of feelings. Sometimes I'm fine, sometimes I'm completely on the ground.

Then we met again on Sunday, which I initiated. He sobbed all the way there, said that he loved me very much, but he was no longer enthusiastic about things together, and that this woman was very understanding and loved him. The relationship has been going on for a total of 2 weeks, but I heard that my husband has liked her for a longer time since August. After that we layed together for hours and kissed each other, my husband was completely upset by this, but in the end he left again because he said he wanted to be with this woman. I heared from her mother that after the breakup he kept asking her about me, what I could do, what could happen to me, he was worried about me, and he also repeated to her that he loves me very much, but he can't make me happy.

I was totally confused after that because I thought it was a sign that this was just a low point, because this woman was just a consequence of something, we didn't pay enough attention to each other, and I was ready to fix our marriage.

But the other day I found out that they went abroad on a work trip, where they already slept in a hotel room, so I was on the ground again.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

My husband and I did a lot of things together, we ran, hiked, and worked on joint projects, which is why I unfortunately don't understand the lack of fulfillment. I would ask him this too, but he doesn't give a concrete answer to anything, he feels that he can't find himself in this relationship, or anywhere, and everything is uncertain.

I can't process this sudden change at the moment, because last week we were on a hike together, and everything seemed fine.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gf2x4j/update_my_suspicions_were_correctmy_wife_has_been/) **- 31st October 2024**

**I think my wife might be cheating on me with a 17-year-old she coaches... but I don’t know for sure. What should I do?**

Alright, I never thought I’d be in this situation, but I’m completely at a loss here and I need some advice. My wife (33F) has been acting really strange lately, and I’m starting to think she might be cheating on me… with one of the kids she coaches. I feel sick even typing that.

Some background: my wife is an accountant by day, and in the evenings, she volunteers as a soccer coach for a local youth team. She's always loved soccer, and I thought it was great that she was so involved with the kids and the community. But recently, she’s been dropping weird comments that are starting to really concern me.

It all started about two months ago. She casually mentioned one of the boys on her team — he’s 17, and I won’t say his name for obvious reasons. At first, it was harmless stuff, like “He’s really talented for his age” or “He’s a natural leader on the field.” I didn’t think much of it because, well, she’s a coach, and it’s her job to encourage the kids, right?

But then the comments started to get...weird. Like one night, out of nowhere, she said, “You know, \[kid’s name\] has really pretty eyes. They’re so striking.” I remember thinking, ""Uh, that’s an odd thing to say about a kid you're coaching."" I kind of brushed it off at first, but then more things followed.

Another time, she came home after practice and said, “He’s so much more athletic than anyone else on the team. It’s impressive how developed he is.” Again, I tried to shake it off, but my gut started nagging at me. Why is she talking about him so much?

Then there’s the fact that she’s been getting way more secretive. She’s always been open with her phone and emails, but lately, she’s been turning her screen away from me when she texts or checks messages. I asked her about it, and she just laughed it off, saying I was being paranoid.

She’s also been staying later and later after practices. At first, she told me it was just because they were prepping for some tournament, but now, even with the tournament over, she’s still coming home late. When I ask, she gives vague excuses like, “Oh, the team needed extra help,” or “I had some paperwork to catch up on.”

Here’s the thing that really has me spiraling: Last week, I came home early from work. I expected to have the house to myself since she was supposed to be at practice, but when I walked in, I found her sitting on the couch, texting someone with a huge smile on her face. When she saw me, she quickly locked her phone and got super flustered. She said it was ""just one of the parents asking about game schedules,"" but it didn’t feel right.

I don’t have any solid proof, but something just feels *off*. Why would she be talking about this kid’s looks? Why is she suddenly so secretive? I haven’t been able to shake the feeling that something more is going on.

I don’t want to accuse her of something so serious without any real evidence, but I also don’t want to ignore my instincts. I love her, and I really don’t want to believe she’d do something like this, especially with a kid she’s supposed to be mentoring.

So, Reddit, what should I do? Am I reading too much into this? Is she cheating on me with this 17-year-old, or am I just being paranoid? How do I even begin to confront her about something like this?

Any advice would be appreciated. I’m honestly feeling lost right now.

**Updates:**

Hi everyone,

First off, I want to thank all of you for the overwhelming amount of comments, advice, and support on my original post. I really needed some sense knocked into me, and I genuinely appreciate the community’s input—it has meant a lot during this confusing time.

After reading your comments, I took some of your advice and contacted my lawyer on the evening of my original post. I’ll go into more details about that shortly, but before diving into the updates, I’d like to clarify why this post is coming out now and in this format.

Unfortunately, after posting, my original post was taken down and I received a three-day ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was later restored, but I had to wait until the ban lifted to share updates. I did keep track of each development and wrote them out as they happened, so I’ll be sharing them in chronological order, just as I intended from the start.

I am posting the updates on a new post because there is so much to say, and I think creating a new post is best for organising all of the updates in a clear manner. In the update post will include a link to the original post for those who may not of seen it.

**Comments**

**AtlantaDave998**

*Ask to see her phone. Her answer will tell you all you need to know. Her behaviour has given you many reasons to doubt her stories.*

**ThanksContent28**

*I feel for OP. I remember the moment I realised my ex was smiling at her phone, in that certain way you do, when you first meet someone you have a big crush on.*

*It’s instantly recognisable (even though I was blind to it for a long time), and it really sinks your stomach when you see your spouse doing it whilst on the phone.*

*Ops instinct and gut his telling him everything he needs to know, but accepting it and acting on it is heartbreaking, to say the least.*

**LilBun29**

*This probably isn’t the time but I want to say one time my ex & I were going to pick up some food and he caught me smiling like that through the windshield of the car as he was walking back. He immediately came in and said “talking to my replacement?” And I proceeded to turn around and show him the photo of the octopus meme I was dying about. He actually looked disappointed by that lol! Just wanted to add a dash of wholesome to this conversation* 😂

**ThanksContent28**

*Yeah people reading my comment should be careful not to get too emotionally involved. For me it was a case where there were multiple signs, not just the smile. She was sitting at the other end of the bed, glued to her phone - among other things.*

*I know maturity and forgiveness is the trend, but she can rot in the gutter, and we still wouldn’t be even.*

**SpaceWitch31**

*Honestly, I felt that. And as someone who’s been deconstructing their Christianity and isn’t one anymore, I now understand and agree with forgiveness on your own time* **if ever at all.** *That’s for you to decide, if and when you decide to and if it comes down to* **never** *never, then* **never never** *it is. It gets drilled into our brains so much about being the one to forgive because it’s what the big man would do and want you to do, and it’ll make you feel better. But why should I have to forgive my abusive ex-stepfather who’s fucked me up so much at 15 it’s affects have lasted well into my 30’s? Why should I forgive my ex-fiancé for going and being with the woman who lived down the block’s date for her yearly formal family reunion while I was unconscious for two days in the ICU? For my benefit? If I wanna be mad and hang onto it for however long I intend to, then let me be. After all, I’m the one who decides IF and when I want to forgive because some things just don’t deserve it. I hope you’re in a better place these days. Forgive if and when you’re ready to if you haven’t already.*

**RoundGold6729**

*Don’t ask her. Do it.*

*If you ask her, she will delete everything before giving it to you and it will endanger the teenager more.*

*Be smarter about this.*

**easy\_avocado420**

*Honestly he should hire a PI. If she’s really doing this, she’s probably covering her tracks. Something this big needs concrete evidence. OPs emotions are too high to see anything, he may react before having proof, giving her a chance to shut everything down, this should probably be done quietly so she doesn’t suspect a thing.*

**SummerIceCream3893**

*He should get a PI on this. She is possibly having an affair with a 17 year old boy; what happens when he goes off to college, does she move on to a 15 year old?*

*The possible cheating is one thing. The fact that she is attracted to a child is another. And the fact that she has put herself in a position to be around children is disturbing. If this were a man that was being talked about, people would be focused on the possible predator situation. If OP's wife is a possible predator, he needs to distance himself from looking into the situation but hire a PI to find out what is going on. Then go to the parents of the boy if 17 is the age of consent in his state. Otherwise, he should go to the police- it's not about nuking his wife for cheating; it's about dealing with a predator if the PI finds this is the case.*

**evilwatersprite**

*Agreed. It’s also a SafeSport violation — even just the texting component. Get evidence and go to the police.*

**Original post summary:**  
For those of you who didn’t see my original post, here’s a brief summary:

In my previous post, I shared some difficult suspicions about my wife, who recently became increasingly close to a 17-year-old boy she coaches. She started making strange comments about his looks, athletic abilities, and personal qualities that went beyond her usual enthusiasm for coaching. Meanwhile, she’s become much more secretive with her phone and is often late home from practice without clear explanations. These changes have left me wondering if there’s something more happening between them, but I don’t have solid proof and don’t want to jump to conclusions without evidence.

**Late update**:  
First off, I want to thank everyone for the comments, advice, and support on my original post. Unfortunately, my original post was initially taken down, and I received a three-day temporary ban from the subreddit. Thankfully, the post was eventually restored after my ban ended. Since I wasn’t able to share updates during that time, I’ve decided to create a new post with all the updates so far, structured chronologically to keep everything organized. Sorry to keep everyone waiting—this is why I’m only updating now, and the last five days have also been a whirlwind.

**Post update 1:**  
I took some of your advice and reached out to a lawyer—well, sort of. An old friend from high school, who’s now a successful family lawyer, happens to be visiting this week. While family law isn’t exactly what I need, I’d rather speak to someone I trust before hiring a lawyer and potentially escalating things out of control.

I’m meeting him for coffee tomorrow and will update you afterward. I’m hoping he can give me some solid legal advice without things getting too intense. I obviously don’t want her to be arrested or anything drastic like that, but I also don’t know what to do next. Right now, I’m not even angry—just overwhelmed and in shock. It’s hard to process that someone I’ve been so close to over the last two years might not be who I thought and could have been hiding something awful this whole time.

**Post update 2:**  
The last five days have been absolute hell. The title is a bit of a giveaway, but pretty much everyone who commented was right, and my own suspicions have been confirmed.

After talking to my friend (the lawyer), we agreed that I should confront her with my concerns suggest looking through her phone together just to put some of my suspicions to rest. I realise how risky this was, but we really didn’t have a lot of choice considering there was no clear proof that anything weird had been going on.  
He suggested that we meet somewhere quiet, but still in a public setting in case she decided to freak out and do something irrational. I decided to take her our local park where I sat her down on a park bench well away from any crowds of people.

When we sat down together, I told her how serious of a situation we could be in and that she MUST be completely honest with me, and that want to be on her side but the way she had been acting had led to some serious suspicions. I explained to her that I didn’t want to break the trust between us so had decided against looking through her phone, despite how tempted I was.

When I told her the concerns, she immediately got defensive and started denying everything. She called me a “paranoid asshole” for even suggesting that she would be in a relationship with a minor. She said the fact that I would even question something like this means there’s probably something wrong with me and that I must be the one hiding something.

Honestly, the way she reacted just confirmed to me that there was something that she hadn’t been telling me this entire time and that without her cooperation, the safest bet was probably just to leave.

I suggested that we look through her phone together just to provide ME with closure and even if there was nothing to hide, it would mean a lot to me that she would just humour me and that it might even be fun to look through together and laugh at how ridiculous I was being.

She screamed at me for “trying to invade her privacy” and that I had massively overstepped the line before storming away from me, back to the car and driving to her friend’s house to stay for the night.

I don’t know what she talked about with her friend but at around 3:00 am the next morning I got a really long text from her giving her view of the situation. The messages was as follows (the entire message was considerably long so I’ve summarised it for this post): 

My wife - I really don’t think what I have been doing is wrong, it started with me just helping this kid with some extra practice because he was struggling to get the hang of some of the drills we had been working on in that days training session. These private sessions were becoming more regular and after about three weeks of extra training sessions he sent me a friend request to my Instagram. He wasn’t the first one of the team to send me a request and I wouldn’t usually accept them but as I was giving this kid private coaching sessions I though it made more sense.  
He started to send me DMs so I responded, because I’m not a total asshole. Ok, maybe the texts aren’t just about soccer anymore, there’s nothing wrong with being friends with a kid, you’ve always been super close to your younger brother and I’ve never called you out for being “weird”.

The message then proceeded to say how much of an asshole I was for trying to call her out and trapping her in a situation that would always leave her looking bad.

She ended the message by telling me that she thinks that she’ll be able to look past this and forgive me for being a “total insecure dickhead” and that if I ever questioned her like this again, she would be filing for a divorce.

I was in complete shock when I read this response as I have never seen this side to my wife. This is not the kind, loving, respectful, and open person whom i had married and it is driving me totally insane, I just don’t know what to do.

I understand that what she was telling me is not normal and I can’t believe how naïve I have been for so long, but I still feel like there’s even more going on that she’s not telling me. Her long message didn’t actually explain why she had been messaging this kid so much and for so long, or why she had been spending literal hours every evening locked in our bedroom or on the sofa just on her phone.

IDK, maybe I AM just being paranoid?

Maybe this is more normal than I’m making it out to be, although this seems unlikely.

Should I still try to look through her phone anyway, despite what she’s told me?

When we had met the previous day, my friend mentioned that this was out of his field but that I shouldn’t contact the police until I was more sure of anything because if we did end up getting a divorce, and she is technically innocent, calling the police on your wife for providing extra help to a kid she coaches wouldn’t look very good for me in a courtroom.

*Say nothing, reach out to the kids parents and have them get his phone. If there is shadiness going on, THEY'LL be calling the police. Then your hands are clean of it.*

*If it happens and there is enough to call the police, get a lawyer.*

**prettyprettythrowthingwow**[](https://www.reddit.com/user/prettyprettythingwow/)

*God, but at what point is he failing to be a mandated reporter? In a lot of states you are REQUIRED to report, no matter your profession, if you suspect child or elder abuse. He's really in a fucked up position. I would obtain an attorney in the correct space IMMEDIATELY and proceed with their advisement.* \\

***EDIT: Since people are not bothering to read further comments or do a quick Google on the matter, yes, you as a layperson, can be a mandated reporter. I will address US, UK, Canada.***

***MANDATED REPORETER:*** *In several states, EVERYONE is required to report suspicion of elder and minor abuse (ex:* [*Florida*](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0039/Sections/0039.201.html)*), in* [*Canada*](https://cwrp.ca/frequently-asked-questions-faqs#:~:text=Do%20I%20need%20to%20report,suspected%20child%20maltreatment%20by%20law)*, EVERYONE is a mandated reporter except in the Yukon Territory, in the UK it is said that everyone SHOULD be a mandated reporter, but there is no legal consequence (they have suggested* [*legislation*](https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/news/2024/may/mandatory-reporting-child-sexual-abuse#:~:text=The%20duty%20to%20report%20child,they%20witness%20the%20abuse%20happening) *to change it to everyone) and it is blurry whether there are protections in place for spouses.*

***The AGE.*** *In MANY states, it does not MATTER how close the child is to 18, as long as the child is under 18, they are therefore a minor, a child, there are* [*exceptions*](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/capta.pdf)*, but I will not list all 50 state laws. In the UK, it is the* [*same*](https://nya.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/position-of-trust-guidance-1.pdf)*, they are a minor at 17, and in Canada, it is the* [*same*](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/other-autre/clp/faq.html)*, they are a minor at 17.*  
***Now, REGARDLESS OF AGE and/or age GAP*** *(which can matter in some US states), there is still a potential crime and/or reason for termination when in a coach/teacher role and engaging with a minor. I do not think this applies to a spouse of the coach/teacher when the student is either a minor in an unprotected state or not a minor. HOWEVER, it can lead to issues legally, where the spouse may appear prejudiced.*

***WHY OP should speak to a lawyer in the correct field BEFORE taking action.***

1. *If everything is above board and legal, in a potential divorce, his actions could look like prejudice and be used against him when dividing assets/property/spousal support/etc*
2. *If they were considered a mandatory reporter, WHY did they wait? Have a lawyer walk them through the right steps to carefully explain WHY they waited, how they waited for legal advice to know how to report, etc. Protect themselves legally*
3. *The lawyer should then suggest the action that most likely provides protection for the minor, with or without proof from the coach. Is that warning of the parents? (What if they don't care), report to the police? (what if they want more evidence), report to the school/coaching team? etc.*

***Now, stop replying TO ME with your dumbass responses*** *about* ***how this isn't possible.***

**z-eldapin**

*Sure, but her phone has been wiped. The only way to preserve his, maybe, is the element of surprise.*

**prettyprettythrowthingwow**

*Text messages and other data can be recovered by law enforcement to an extent. He absolutely must not put himself at risk over this shit because of her bad decisions. Lawyer first.*

**art\_addict**

*Mandated reporters don’t need proof. Just suspicion of abuse. CPS determines whether something warrants an investigation and then investigates and looks to see whether there is proof or if it’s unfounded. (Mandated reporter here, not everyone in my state is, and I’ve attended extra trainings on it when family/ friends go because idk I’m a nerd or something, refreshers are good though!)*

**HermitBee**

>

*How does that work? If it is mandatory to report any suspicion of child abuse, how much suspicion do you need?*

**Significant-Art-5478**

*Mandated Reporters are typically given training that helps them decide this. For us, it was knowing what signs of abuse are. Teachers are one of the most common mandated reporters because they see the kids daily, and notice a lot of their behaviors.*

*I called as a preschool teacher after a 3rd child in 1 family reported a monster that woke them up at night. They'd also started having issues using the bathroom, something they'd previously been fine doing. They were only 3 and somewhat delayed in speech, so we could only go off of their behaviors. Since they were similar to their sibling... well I called CPS and all 3 children were removed from the home.*

**Max\_manford--update 2nd November 2024 (in comments)**

*The police have been contacted, but as of now, there aren’t any legal grounds to pursue anything. I’ll provide more details in the next update, but I want to approach this carefully without completely destroying her trust. I haven’t gone through her phone, but I did reach out to our shared network provider, and after explaining the situation, I was able to get some limited information on her recent contacts.*

*One challenge is that I actually don’t know who the kid is. I’ve never met anyone on the team she coaches, and I don’t remember any specific names she’s mentioned before. Without knowing more, it’s tough to involve his parents directly, though I’m definitely trying to make sure I’m doing everything right. Thank you for the advice and concern, it really helps to hear different perspectives.*

**YourLocalWhiteKid**

*Your phone carrier often has a record of text messages online and they can be accessed either just by logging into your account or you need to contact their support sometimes but just because it's deleted from the phone doesn't erase its existence. Just need to be an authorized user on the account.*

Now that I disturbed it I’m not sure this is Kahm Yeast or a new Pellicle slowly forming. Do you experts who have experience brewing kombucha have any insights for me here?

Background/Process: Pretty bizarre but I’ve never even tried kombucha. My partner loves it so I’ve secretly been saving up and to get the supplies and going down Reddit/YouTube rabbit holes to figure out how to brew her homemade kombucha.

This is my first batch, and it’s on Day 2. I brewed a tea concentrate using 9 Black Tea Packets into of 4 Cups of Filtered+Boiled Water. It seeped for 10 minutes then I mixed it with 8 Cups of Room Temperature, Filtered Water and about 1.25 Cups of Sugar. After about an hour its temperature was cool enough to add the starter I got from Amazon, which had a pellicle and 2 cups of liquid. I covered the gallon jar securely with a coffee filter and wrapped it up with a heating pad because our indoor temperature is just below 70°F.

If you guys think it’s Kahm Yeast do you have any advice for what I can do to salvage this batch and brew more successfully in the future. If — heaven forbid — it’s mold I’m going to dump and start anew. It’s supposed to be a pleasant not risky surprise for her after all!

Also would love to hear any favorites for the F2 flavoring. I’ve got some Flip-Top bottles for Kombucha and have seen enough happy accidents online to know that I’ll be using the bag method outdoors when things get bubbly! Thanks in advance for any help or input!!!

He is doing great and has been seemingly chill about it almost since day one. At this point we leave him for 3,5 hours almost every mon-friday, and most often he plays for a while and then sleeps for the rest of that time (we use a nanny cam). 

When we are both home on the other hand, we almost always take turns being “on him” while the other does something in another room. This involves being with him in the living room either playing with him, training his commands or trying to make him fall asleep in his bed or on the couch (we don’t use a crate or a pen).

When we do both leave the living room, he often barks a few times, and if the one of us, who is doing something in another room stays out there for longer periods (for instance showering, cooking or cleaning), he often stand at the gate we put between the hallway and the living room and waits for the other person to come back, even when the one of us who is still with him tries to activate him, call him or give him attention. We haven’t really practiced both of us being for instance in the kitchen that much, since his only accidents by now seem to be when he is home alone or when both of us go in another room for a while, which makes us think it is some sort of reaction to being left alone. 

The “worst” for him is when we’re out for a walk, and one of us goes inside a shop to pick up a coffee or a parcel or something, while he has to wait outside with the other person. Here he starts crying and pulling towards the entrance and wont leave an inch before the person who left comes back. Sometimes we’ve tried practicing this having one of us go to the supermarket to grocery shop while the other waits with him outside and gives him treats, when he sits nicely, which has helped a little bit. 

Do any of you have any experience with this or any ideas for ways we could train him to get used to being “alone” while we’re at home and/or being with just one of us?

I've been doing so much reading and I've read several of these ""First time cruise"" I'm so overwhelmed posts. Oh well, here is mine:

My partner and I have never been on a cruise. We work super hard in the summer but get time off in the winter. We started talking about a week or so for vacation for just the two of us. We both know people who have gone on cruises and love them. So I'm investigating the options!

* Looking for pretty relaxed, not into drinking a ton of alcohol, but I'd love some fancy coffee! For example a good cappuccino, and NO starbucks is not my idea of quality coffee. No offense if you're good with that, just not my cup! 
* Not necessarily interested in parties or activities.
* Good workout facilities would be awesome, minimum a good range of dumbbells, do any ships have decent weight rooms with squat racks and pullup bars?
* Is 5-8 days a good starting point? I want to have enough time to just chill and see if it's a good time but not too much time that if we hate it it's terrible!
* Has to be in February, between the 2nd and the 20th or so.
* Oh, yeah and leaning towards a veranda, but we don't need a ton of space. 

I'm leaning towards Virgin Voyages, I know it's a little silly but the idea of hammock on a balcony sounds incredible! Also sounds like they are pretty open minded and welcoming (+lgbtqia)

We traded social media stuff and I messaged him later the next day about something we’d talked about that night because I remembered he was a bit drunk at the time and I was trying to subtly figure out if he still remembered us talking. He did. The next day I messaged him again because I was reading a book he recommended and we talked for a short time about it over messages.

I’m so bad over text though. So I really can’t tell if he’s interested still. And I also can’t tell if he’s one of those people who also (like me) just doesn’t know where to go with conversations when texting people. I’m especially bad at texting when it’s someone I still don’t know very well. I’m pretty confident that we were both interested in each other during the night that we first met, but I don’t know if he still feels any interest now? I keep asking myself if he was interested only because there weren’t a lot of other girls at the event, or maybe it was just the alcohol and the fact that I was a girl talking to him, and not that he was actually interested in anything beyond that.

And it’s not like we’ve talked enough over messages for me to figure out if he’s into me or just replying to what I’m saying because he’s polite. It wasn’t like what I was sending him was something you can really make a lot of conversation out of, especially when you just don’t really know each other yet. 

So now I’ve been trying to figure out if it’s a good idea to just straight up ask him out and see if he’d want to get coffee or something with me, or if I should wait a few more days and see if he sends something to me first before jumping the gun too quickly or coming off as strange (big fear of mine). I have been single my whole life, and never felt a crazy strong urge to change it, but I met him and now I’ve just been thinking about him since.

Thanks to your help, and the book 'No period, now what?' I have gotten my period back after just 1 month of going 'all-ish in"", or ""all in-ish""?!? 

I've struggled with ED and HA for about 10 years. I've had long stretches (I'm talking years) of no periods, then I've had some short stretches of having a period, but I've never made a dedicated effort to changing my food/exercise habits to commit to getting my period back. Here's the deets!

* What I did: 
   * Stopped running. I used to run 5 miles everyday, and then walk an additional 1-2 miles
   * Only walked for cardio. I walk about 4-5 miles a day now.

   * Continued doing pilates. I used to mix in some pilates about once or twice a week, on days where I didn't do high intensity strength training classes. Now, I do pilates every morning. 
   * Stopped doing any exercise fasted! I always eat before and after my walks/pilates. 
   * Started eating breakfast shortly after waking. Whether it's PB pretzels, graham crackers and peanut butter, muesli and milk, I always eat something within about 30 minutes of waking. I used to skip breakfast. 
   * Started eating more snacks. I used to only eat a protein bar and then 2 meals per day. Now, I snack in between meals and attempt to never let myself get hungry. 
   * Reduced/nearly eliminated restrictions around what I will and won't eat. My husband wants to go to Chickfila, I'll get a chicken sandwich and some fries!

   * Replaced all my low-fat dairy with full fat dairy

1gpw3v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1gpw3v3/emotionally_draining_friends/,Emotionally draining friends.,"'Sup everyone.

This'll be my first such post, so forgive my freestyling in how to convey this.

I'm approaching my thirties, and i'm coming to terms with how much energy i genuinely have, and how much i can emotionally sustain for both myself and others.  
Being someone empathetic, i've always made a point of being there for my friends to the best of my ability.  
This attracted, naturally, a few people who like to share their problems with me.  
This in itself, i very much appreciate, for honesty and trust are wonderful in a friendship.

Now to the issue; everyone goes through tough times, myself included. Recent years have equally been tough on me, but i'm working on both myself and my circumstances.

My closest friend, with whom i've talked and spent time with almost daily for several years prior, has been spiraling downwards into depression.  
This, combined with my wanting to help and be there for him, has led to him turning nearly every hangout session into him complaining about his problems.  
Problems that needn't be problems, for he is by all accounts doing pretty well in life.  
He's dating, he's paid off his house, he has a stable and well paying job and he's a professional musician.  
Again, i how troubling some things are, and that he processes things by talking about them, but it seems he makes up issues and hyperfocuses on them to the point where, genuinely, he ranted for half an hour about a spilled coffee cup. Coffee stains. While i'm dealing with my own fair share of hard social and professional problems.

He's oversharing \*hard\*, and when he's in rant mode, which has become more and more prevalent, he simply won't take advice.  
Well thought out advice given by me simply goes ignored, even when i, upon request, explain in detail how i would handle things, what i think he could do (like getting back into shape, getting therapy, taking walks, picking up a hobby, ect.) to improve his situation and the endless circles he thinks himself into.  
He has no desire to improve, even if he says that he does.

He'll always seek an easy excuse for why he's unable to make progress, whilst repeatedly bringing up the same issues, again and again and again and again.  
I told him on several occasions, in kind and patient ways, that i simply dont know anymore what else to say.

But the ranting continues.  
I've come to realize how intensely draining his dependency on my empathy is to me and my increasingly limited emotional energy.  
When i've told him kindly and in greatly reassuring detail how i perceive things, that i would like him to, tldr; 'complain less', i was met with him telling me that i made him feel rejected and generally like shit.

I dont know what to do, no idea how to best handle this. Whatever i do, i hurt him, which i really dont want to.  
I \*need\* boundaries at this point, and my only way of doing so, is simply at this point to just not talk to- or hang out with him anymore.  
Days, weeks go by without me talking to him, and the guilt is weighing on me. Talking to him still on occasion still yields the same results.  
After my telling him that i need boundaries, genuinely the next day, he went back to venting hard about the most minute of problems, as if they were the end of the world.  
I know that everyone's their own judge for how hard ones problems are, but i can't care anymore.

How would you peeps, who've dealt with situations like this, do?

I am trying to identify the age and provenance of a solid wood coffee table I was given. It's a beautiful table. The wood may be walnut, or it could be stained conifer of some kind. I am in the USA and the former owner purchased it at an antique fair in New Jersey or California approximately 40 years ago. There is a distinct black stain used as an accent in addition any other stains or varnish on the wood. The legs and table are constructed entirely with joinery. Each parquet square is made of 5 tiny pieces slotted into place, and then the 4 squares create the larger squares. 

Pictures here: [https://imgur.com/a/F6AbeRN](https://imgur.com/a/F6AbeRN)

It looks like there are two or three screws added for stability much later in life where the table top meets the legs.

I very recently got into fragrances and almost immediately turned my nose up on a bunch of scents (literally). Smelling like a cupcake? Yuck. Smelling like a cigar box? Gross. Vetiver? No thanks. Oud? Get out of here. 

I went to Sephora and tried a bunch of perfumes on my list and walked away with 3 perfumes and once I had had a day and started using them, I realized they were very reminiscent of each other. I had totally boxed myself into a type. 

And not that there’s anything wrong with that but a couple of days ago I had occasion to travel to someplace with a Very Nice Bloomingdale’s and the perfume exploring experience was of course another tier up. I went to some counters and liked the thing I thought I was going to like (Mind Games Castling and Hermes Un Jardin Sur Le Nil) but Juan Carlos at the Killian counter really opened up the world of fragrances for me. I was there to try Old Fashioned but found it much too photorealistic (I’m sober lol) but he talked me through a bunch of scents I would never have tried on my own and when I got my nose on Phantom Black — pow!

I’ve been drinking alcohol just about every day this past week, if that matters at all, 2-3 drinks a day. Usually I only drink 3-4 days (not any better I know). Saturday I had 6 while hanging out with my bf.. another thing about me and what I believe to be the reason for this 2nd UTI, since a little girl I’ve had a terrible habit of holding my pee until I’m bouncing my legs. Family and friends and even my boss have always told me “go pee!”. I’m not sure just something in my brain tells me I need to finish what I’m doing/it can wait.

So I woke up at 4am yesterday with pelvic pain having to pee bad, but when I went to pee hardly anything came out. My immediate thought was “oh no”… my pelvic area was hurting and still nothing else was coming out. I went back to bed and laid there in uncomfortable pain still, and went back to the bathroom another 2 times where I’d sit for 10 minutes and literal drops came out. 

In the morning, I finally could pee but I had a slight pain after I was done (not stinging, just an odd pain down there). Throughout the day, the pain lessened and lessened. Now today (day 2) I’m at work and don’t feel anything I don’t think. I’ve been drinking water (not a lot but usually I have coffee so of course I couldn’t have that today and have substituted my thirst with water, which is better anyway). 

I don’t have insurance anymore and my local urgent care quoted me $225 for a visit for UTI urine sample and a prescription. Doesn’t cover cost of the medicine prescribed. 

Should I still see a doctor?? I know there is slight risks for untreated UTIs.. 

EDIT to add: Last UTI was about 1-2 years ago, and symptoms lasted for days and it was very bad stinging  pain every time. I was on the medicine that turns your pee orange I believe. ",1,1731446655.0,WomensHealth,0,0.99,False

Below is what I did to make things so smooth and stress-free. My doctor prescribed me the two (2) bottle prep, one the night before and one the morning of the colonoscopy.

* Started to eat simple, non-complex foods two (2) days before the official prep began. No nuts or anything with seeds. Drinking lots of water.
* A day before the start of the prep drink I used Miralax to help start cleaning me out. Drinking lots of water and still eating light. Lot of soup and toast.
* Bought the following for the day of prep drink:
   * Lemon-lime Gatorade Zero
   * KinderLyte lemonade (A BIG win)
   * Flushable wet wipes, **kept in the fridge to keep cold**
   * Extra soft toilet paper
   * Low-calorie, sugar-free lemon drink mix packets
   * Sugar-free ginger ale
   * Sugar-free jello (non-red color)
   * Sugar-free gummy bears (picked out only the lemon & pineapple, no color ones)
   * Chicken broth (2)
   * Small bottle of lemon juice
   * Gas-X
* Day of the first bottle of prep, I was still eating very little & simple, and drinking a lot of water. 
* Stopped drinking 2 hours before the start of the medicine.
* An hour before having to start drinking the prep, I poured the liquid medication into the supplied cup and filled the remainder of the cup with chilled Gatorade with a squirt of lemon juice.
* Time to start to drink the prep, I poured a glass of sugar-free ginger ale.
* Using a straw, I took a big gulp of the prep and then took a sip of the ginger ale and swooshed it around my mouth to help get the yucky taste out of my mouth.
* Kept repeating the process until the prep drink was gone. When done, popped 1 Gas-X pill.
* Drank the large amount of water required after the prep drink. I added a splash of lemon, to help it be more palatable. 
* Prep kicked in within an hour and before rushing to the toilet, I grabbed the pack of wet wipes that I stored in the fridge.
* When I was in a good place and was able to leave the bathroom, I drank half of the KinderLyte.
* When day 1 was done, I made myself a BIG bowl of chicken broth with toast and drank more water. Ate some gummy bears and jello for dessert.
* Prepared the next cup of prep (same as above) and left it in the fridge overnight.
* Went to bed early after taking a sleep-aid pill.
* Woke up early on the day of the colonoscopy and repeated the same steps as above. 
* Drank all the required water, and prepared a big cup of black coffee, and added hot water to make an Americano. 
* Prep kicked in and I made sure I had the chilled wet wipes. The cold helped relieve some of the soreness from wiping too much. Plus, you can hold the cold wipe to help with the pain.
* Finished the bottle of KinderLyte.
* Made myself a big bowl of broth again, snacked on the gummy bears, (no jello, too worried about the color), and another Americano before the cut-off time.
* The day of the procedure I was relieved to know it went smoother than the day before, and I was feeling good.

I believe all the tips from this group helped me make a good game plan for an easy prep. I could not have been happier and have to give a **BIG THANK YOU** to this group.

I’m 34F and I’m experiencing some issues that I would finally like to go to the doctor for, but not sure how to discuss this or what kind of testing to request. 

For the last 3 months I’ve been feeling constant fatigue. I feel like I’m moving in slow motion. I’m constantly confused, my husband will tell me things, or tell me I said something, and I will immediately forget what was said maybe 5-10 minutes later. The fatigue and brain fog is getting worse by the day. I thought maybe it was due to diet so this last week I started a new high protein, moderate fat, low carb diet. The week I started this diet, my period was supposed to start during the weekend, but it never came and it’s now 4 days late. I think I’m having some kind of hormonal issue. 

I’m currently 7 months post partum after having a stillbirth. I then had an emergency gallbladder surgery a month later, and then was in a car crash this summer. I suppose I’m still recovering from all of these things but it feels like I’m getting worse and not better. I don’t know what to test for or what to do. I have no energy at all. I feel tired just typing this. I’ve been sleeping about 8-9 hours every night this last week and then falling asleep randomly through out the day. 

I wake up and make iced coffee (almond milk and black coffee) and it gives me no energy. I constantly feel like I’m out of my body. I feel like I’m looking at the world through a plastic bag no matter how much I rub my eyes it doesn’t get clearer. I want to start exercising but I feel so weak I can’t even walk to my mailbox without feeling dizzy and like I’ll pass out. I try to do small housework tasks and after about 10 minutes I have to sit down because I feel out of breath and light headed.

My husband said it’s “keto flu” but I keep explaining to him I’ve been feeling like this for months, it’s just that it’s at its peak this week. He doesn’t think I’m pregnant, he thinks the diet has changed my period. I also think I’m likely not pregnant, and instead I’m losing my ability to have periods or ovulate due to some kind of hormonal issue. ",1,1731446505.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

This was a complete guesstimation recipe that I made it up as i went along so please bear with me as I've done my best to remember what I used. 😅

In a bowl, mix together with a fork till coated:
- Approx 2 1/2 cups flour (roughly 310g according to Google)
- 3 tsp baking powder 
- 1 tbsp sugar, a pinch salt
- A chunk of extra mature English cheddar cheese (grated) which I think amounted to about 100g
- Same volume of butter as the cheese (frozen and grated)
- 1 small red onion (diced)

- Then with the same fork, I mixed in 1 1/4 cups fridge cold milk (which is about 295ml according to Google) till a shaggy dough forms. 

- Turn the dough out onto a clean countertop then quickly form it together into a disc about an inch thick being careful not to handle it too much or overwork it (you want to keep it as cold as possible and avoid gluten formation). A dough scraper can help with gathering up the bits onto the dough mass without using your (warm) hands.

- Cut the dough disc into 12 equal pizza shaped slices and space them out on a tray.

- Brush the tops with a tiny bit of milk and sprinkle with a little bit more grated cheese.

- Bake at 190°c/375°f for about 25 minutes or until golden brown.

ADHD test was negative too","I got off of a mood stabilizer and antidepressant concoction that I’ve been taking since the start of adolescence early this year (2024). In total, I was probably on that mix for 14 years. 

Since the physical withdrawals ended after the first two months, there are symptoms that are popping up that are seriously affecting my daily functioning. 

I *need* to be moving some body part or everything feels wrong. 
I can’t function back to and only return to 85% normalcy after going for a long run or intense workout. 
sitting still in a meeting is a nightmare. 
I have a go-to fidget box. 
I have a hard time writing a gd email. 
I get agitated so easily by minor inconveniences. 
Anger and sadness are the strongest emotions I’ve been feeling that lead to me punching pillows and having crying fits out of nowhere. 
Generally I feel like I don’t fit in my body at all. 

Like something is severely wrong and signs point to autism or adhd or both. Probably some other things too. 

Anyways I got tested for adhd and I was able to sit through the intelligence and cognitive functioning test like nothing with some issues in working memory pointed out. I usually am good with testing so I wasn’t too surprised, and it didn’t help that I had a coffee the morning of testing (and coffee sometimes  helps with the symptoms so I took it to help with getting work done that morning). 

In addition to that, I don’t recall any symptoms showing up in my childhood. They certainly didn’t show up when I was medicated since the cocktail I took pretty much knocked me out to treat insomnia (which I can sleep now but it’s not always restful) and almost sedated me in a way. 

I feel so hopeless about my situation since the symptoms only really shown up as strongly as they have for the past 6 months. The day to day for me is really hard and I don’t know how to keep on going. I can’t keep on running myself ragged to feel normal. I don’t know how to get better and am trying to work with a psychiatrist to find a solution, but they can’t do much without a diagnosis. 

TL;DR is that since stopping meds I’ve been taking for the last 14 years I’ve been seeing symptoms of AuDHD. The ADHD test says I don’t have ADHD and I’m going crazy with how I’m feeling and don’t know how to move forward. ",3,1731446038.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

At this point I’ve realized I shouldn’t mix friendship with business.. especially daycare. But it was hard not to. 

My almost 2 year old has been going to his daycare provider for about 8 months. We’ve become incredible friends over that time and I had never poured my heart and soul into a friendship like I did with this one. I brought her coffees in the morning 2x a week just because I liked to, I bought her $500 worth of drinks, a cake, and vip at our favorite bar for her bday. Bought her kids gifts for their bdays. Bought vapes she didn’t pay me back for. I guess it’s worth mentioning I’m 25 she’s 28 for reference on our maturity levels lol. 

She has had falling outs with every other person who went there and formed a friendship with her so I should’ve seen it coming. 

So here’s where it all starts.. last week Friday I got a call from her while I was working to her scream-crying and was inconsolable. She asked me to cancel the rest of the dogs I was grooming and come sit with her. She had a baby roll over in his crib and turn white and she had to do CPR on him. Obviously, she hasn’t been in a good space mentally. I get that. 

I cancelled my dogs, ran over there, and made dinner for her, her boyfriend, and 3 kids so she could relax for the night. I then told her she should take a week off. 

Now.. she does tell me “I should take a day off” all the time. I explained to her I don’t do that because then I don’t get paid. I understand how daycares work. I understand the terms of our contract. But I asked if she’d be pro-rating for the month considering I had to find other people to babysit and was paying $400 worth to people in payments to watch my son. She said “she can’t do that because she can’t afford it.” And I let her know my money also doesn’t grow on trees. 

This is where sh!t gets whack. She then said “just bring him if that’s the case. I already told the other parents they can bring their kids.” I asked when she was going to let me know she told everybody else that. 

Since our fight yesterday, she said “this is your 2 week notice then.” And blocked me on everything. I really didn’t want to stir the pot more, but I did message her this morning asking why she’d block me when I have 2 weeks left. She said “you’re more than welcome to bring him in but I think you’ve got it covered for people watching him.” I do this week. Not next. But now I’m uncomfortable with the way she’s treating me.. why would she expect me to want to drop him off if I’m blocked on everything? So.. I’d assume it’s obviously on me for not wanting to pay for the rest of this month when I had 2 weeks but she’s made me
Feel less than comfortable for even using the rest of those 2 weeks.

The episode begins in Jules' kitchen, as they often do.
Hey sexy! (Self esteem test, Reddit. Who answered?)

Jules tells everyone she's a morning person. She wakes up asking questions like, ""What's an aardvark?"" Ellie is summoned by her nanny, Rosa.

Jules and Ellie hang out at Ellie's. Jules shares her new phrase ""pound grape"". Ellie explains how much time she spends with Stan. They talk about whether it's harder to be a mother with a baby in your 20s or your 40s.

In the pub, Laurie tells the guys she misses one night stands, and Andy decides to be her wingman. Bobby and Grayson talk golf. If Bobby is up early enough, he can get on the green for free.

The next day is an early start for Grayson. He's off to wait for Bobby to take him to golf. Ellie gets up early when the baby monitor goes off. Jules wakes early and asks Grayson questions. Laurie wakes up swinging. Travis wakes up embracing a laundry hamper. 

Golf cart meet water. 

Ellie and Jules bet on whether Jules can look after Stan for a night. Bippity Boppity Boo, Stan is in Jules' arms, Laurie is leaving, Grayson is sneaking out.

Rosa gives Jules instructions, and calls Grayson to leave work. Grayson helps with Stan. Grayson builds Stan his own Alcatraz (totally not a prison though) 😛

Andy and Laurie go to the wine bar. Apparently once a month the  plaza converts to a club. Laurie doesn't enjoy it as much as she expects to.

Bobby has a new system to get up in the morning. Travis offers to wake Bobby up. Bobby refuses.

Stan locks himself into the pantry. There's a lot of panic. Is Stan OK? Is the wine OK? Ellie comes over with some goldfish crackers to bribe Stan.

Laurie meets a guy and they head to his house. He takes Andy's coffee. ""Paid $3.75!""

Grayson and Jules have survived the night. Travis shows up anyway to help his dad wake up. Laurie does the walk of shame, with pride. 

Jules tells Ellie she doesn't want any more babies.
Andy and Grayson play with Stan. Grayson tells Andy he can't wait to have a kid.

Travis and Bobby both fall asleep on the golf cart. They drive into the sandpit.

The end, for another week!

Thanks for joining folks. Anyone have any anecdotes to share. Ever fallen asleep in a golf cart? Had a baby in your 40s? Mistook red wine for blood? Let everyone know!

Choosing the right cooking appliance for your kitchen can significantly impact your cooking experience. With so many options available, it’s essential to assess your needs and preferences before making a decision. This guide will help you navigate through the process, ensuring that you invest in appliances that serve you best.

### Assess Your Cooking Style

First, think about how you cook. Do you enjoy creating elaborate meals, or do you prefer quick, easy dishes? Understanding your cooking style will help you narrow down the types of appliances you might need. Here are a few questions to consider:

Check Details: https://itrendworld.com/best-cooker

### Consider Available Space

Space can be a limiting factor when selecting cooking appliances. Take measurements of your kitchen area, including cabinets and countertops. Here’s how to approach this:

- Consider appliance height, width, and depth, including any clearance needed.

Choosing appliances that fit well in your space not only enhances functionality but also adds to the overall aesthetic of your kitchen.

### Evaluate Your Budget

Establishing a budget is essential when selecting cooking appliances. Determine how much you are willing to spend. You can categorize your budget into three segments:

While it may be tempting to go for the most expensive models, remember that there are plenty of mid-range options that deliver excellent value.

Identifying the features that align with your cooking habits will significantly enhance your cooking experience.

### Brand Reputation and Reliability

When selecting cooking appliances, it’s wise to consider brands that have established a strong reputation. Research customer reviews and ratings to gain insights about performance and durability. Look for:

- Brands with a history of quality and reliability.
- Warranty terms and customer service availability.
- Industry awards or recognitions that reinforce brand trust.

This research can save you money in the long run by preventing costly repairs or replacements.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy-efficient appliances can help you save on utility bills and reduce your environmental impact. Check for energy ratings and certifications, like ENERGY STAR, indicating that the appliance meets energy-saving standards. Key factors to consider include:

Check Details: https://itrendworld.com/best-cooker

My prior motivations were weak and half-hearted. When my wife decided we should separate (not for weight-related reasons) I was angry at the situation (not at her specifically). My anger and resulting desire to improve were my primary motivation. I knew I wanted to start dating again and I didn't want to do it at 25 lbs. overweight. I was already an avid exerciser (mostly weight training and walking) so nothing has changed there. I just wanted to lose fat. I probably lost some muscle also but I look lean and fantastic now. My body feels so much lighter. All my clothes are loose, etc.

2 meals a day diet:

Breakfast: 7 scrambled eggs with a small amount of olive oil and salt. A bowl of oatmeal: 1/2 cup of dry oatmeal which I mix with boiling water and a little cinnamon. 1 banana. 1 big handful of blueberries. 1 medium handful of crushed walnuts. 2 big cups of coffee with a tiny amount of half and half and a small scoop of allulose powder. The more I eat this breakfast, the more I love it.

Dinner: ""Gloop"" In a big cast iron frying pan (with a tiny amount of olive oil) I fry up a whole can of my favorite beans (either black beans, chick peas, or mixed beans) + a can of premium chunk chicken + half a bag of frozen spinach or broccoli + 1 can of sardines (from Costco) (without the oil!) + small amount of kalamata olives + hot sauce.

We make fragrances based on the scents you smell everyday like coffee and chicken. The idea behind it is the appreciation of the ordinary.

It translates to : Baths for blank 3 camphor Two eating forks A table knife Bay leaves Boil all this and strain it then add Florida water Bitter coffee Take three baths before Saturday

This is because I have been going through spiritual warfare and this is supposed to help take out the negative energy out of my home. I did a coconut ritual and the coconut was rotten (Hindu meaning someone put a spell on me to fall ill and have brittle bones) (I broke 4 bones this year and have been chronically sick).  (It was said by a random person to my grandma someone was doing harm to me(spells,magic etc). So my mom went to see this guy when she went to Dr. he also got a lot of things right such as my hair was falling out and I had random bruises when I spoke with him. Just context, never thought this would happen to me confirmed by different random spiritual people. I just wanted to see what this falls under since Dominican people lean towards two spiritual religions. And of course any advice is welcome. I never know where to post for this kind of stuff.

There is never a dull moment in my work place. If you saw on my post about the strange interaction i had in the morning…the day got even stranger as it went on. 

So the inn i manage (i’m the inn keeper which is another way of saying manager) is a cozy but bougie boutique style one. All our amenities are locally sourced and really popular with our guests. Everything from the coffee in the rooms to the fresh pastries served in our brunch buffet. The guests rave about it. 

Included in this is our soaps, bodywashes etc. local shop makes all of it. They smell amazing and actually work wonders for the hair and skin. Because it’s handmade locally, it’s expensive. We sell it in the gift shop here and guests will complain it’s too pricey. 

So i wasn’t  shocked when a guest decided to lie to my housekeepers and say they ran out of soap etc in their room twice. Housekeeper can’t speak english that well so they just gave it to her. Guest decided to take 3 of each home with her. Called my night attendant pissed that we charged her for each and every one of them. Attendant left a note informing me of that. Called her today, she was not budging on the fact that she did steal them. Hung up on me after saying she was going to dispute the charges. Whatever…

Now not long after, head housekeeper comes in looking like someone or something scared the shit out of her. She tells me we have to charge a specific room for damages…shows me photos of how the guests in said room (whom i spoke to twice yesterday) basically tossed cups of coffee all over the bed, soaking the mattress, bed set, pillows etc in it. 

Worst part is there were 3 large red stains on the sheets that i am 98% sure were blood…so i charged them a fairly high cleaning fee for this. Haven’t heard back yet but they left a bad review and mentioned being “overcharged” after they checked out.

6. I’m so grateful to be able to face my emotions and forgive people quickly. Sometimes it feels like waking up to a major truth to see that holding a resentment hurts me more than anyone else.

1gpv51z,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1gpv51z/2_week_recovery_insight/,2 week recovery insight,"I wanted to write out how I've been doing so people can kinda understand what a recovery might look like. Standard disclaimer of your healing journey may be completely different \*and that's ok\* etc. etc. 

I got my hysterectomy due to abnormal bleeding during periods. I had a total laparoscopic hysterectomy, so I have both ovaries and my vagina, but that's it. Prior to getting this done, over the course of 3 years I had a abdominal ultrasound, an MRI, was put on birth control, and also given tranexamic acid. I also had an endometrial biopsy under anesthesia one month before the hysterectomy. I also did genetic counseling (my mom is adopted so no clue on my cancer risks) and since all results were negative, we decided to keep the ovaries. Had I had a risk of ovarian cancer, we would've discussed removing those too.

**Things I bought before that were helpful:** I went to thrift stores and bought several lounge pants/shirts/etc. that were several sizes up from my regular size. I also bought disposable post-maternity underwear and those came in clutch the first few days. I also got a pack of my regular underwear several sizes up. I got a little bed desk thing that has been super useful for me as I've been doing coloring books and other hobbies I'm behind on. We also brought one of our TVs up into the bedroom so I can binge shows from bed rather than having to go downstairs to the living room. I also tried the Olly fiber gummies and they have definitely helped regulate my bowel movements, so I honestly may continue these well past recovery. I also don't really know if they're helpful or not, but I also got multivitamins to take while I'm on bedrest since I'm not going out much to get sun etc. I already had a wedge pillow so I have been using that daily to sit up with.

**Things I bought before that were not helpful:** Abdominal binder. For me I wanted as little pressure on my stomach was possible, and that just felt awful to me when I tried it on.

**Hospital instructions:** Drink 16oz apple juice night before, do not eat past 10pm, water ok up until 2 hours before surgery, drink another 16oz of apple juice before 6am day of surgery. Take an antibacterial shower the night before and right before heading to the hospital. No lotions/perfumes/etc., nail polish was ok.

**Eviction day:** Woke up around 4:30am to drink the apple juice and take the antibacterial shower. Arrived at the hospital around 5:45am, got checked in and brought back to the pre-op room around 6:15am. I had to do a pregnancy pee test. Also because I was actively on my period, they had trouble finding veins for the IV so they brought in a nurse who used to be in the military... she got it first try but in an awkward/painful location on top of my wrist. That was probably the only annoying thing. My pre-op nurse was amazing. I talked a lot with the anesthesiologist, because when I had my tubal 8 years ago, I was very emotional waking up (I started screaming across the room at the doctor saying thank you over and over again) and was pretty sure it'd happen again this time. They gave me extra anxiety meds and said it would take longer for me to wake up on the other side due to those. The anesthesiology nurse was actually the same one I had for the biopsy a month before, so it was a bit comforting to know someone who already saw how I reacted before was there. My doctor came to visit right around start time, we filled out my leave paperwork together so it had the correct dates for my FMLA/STD leave, and they rolled me back to the OR at 8:05am. They gave me a shot of versed right before rolling back, and while it didn't seem to affect me when I did the biopsy, this time it definitely did and I barely remember entering the OR before my memory stops. The surgery took about 2 hours. They didn't find any endo etc. to clean out, so it was on the shorter end of the surgery time they booked for me.

When I woke up, I don't think I could even open my eyes yet when I said I NEED TO PEE! I was in the first staging post-op room, so as they wheeled me to the second post-op area for awake patients, we stopped by the bathroom. I was INCREDIBLY thankful I boot camped myself into shape for the couple of months prior, it made the log roll method to get out of bed so easy with my arms easily able to push me up. I was able to pee no problem (they put in and took out a catheter under anesthesia), it did sting a tiny bit but the slight relief in belly pressure felt better. Nurse had to come in and verify I had peed before I was allowed to flush. The nausea also really started to hit me then, so after wheeling me into the second post-op area, they gave me some essential oils under my nose while they ran off to get meds. They also brought my partner back. I was pretty in and out of consciousness still, but they gave me a shot of zofran. When they asked my pain level, I said I was a 6 out of 10, so they gave me a shot of oxy as well. It really just felt like a ton of pressure in my stomach. After a bit I felt like I needed to pee again, and I managed to walk to the restroom that time and peed slightly. Getting up from the toilet I had another wave of nausea so the nurse gave me another essential oil packet and got a wheelchair to bring me back to the bed with. I managed to eat some ice chips and 2 bites of a graham cracker, since the last requirement to send me home was to eat something. That was enough, and I got discharged around 1pm. They gave my boyfriend the discharge instructions and a little nausea care kit that included the essential oil packets, some peppermint and ginger teas and candies, some graham crackers and saltines, and a little jar of mouthwash in case you did throw up. I had a small pillow to tuck between my belly and the seatbelt which was very needed. Luckily the hospital was a 5 minute drive from my house, so I was not in the car for long.

I made it home, walked upstairs to the bedroom and honestly slept most of the time or just layed there on my back in the dark. I couldn't use my phone since any scrolling triggered the nausea. I did get up a few times to pee, which triggered the nausea as well. Those essential oil packets were clutch and prevented me from ever throwing up which I appreciated. We ordered more off Amazon, but by the time they arrived I was already past the nausea the next day. I ate a few bites of jello later on that evening, but that was about all I could manage. My boyfriend was very on top of giving me meds, and I took oxy and zofran at the regular intervals.

**Day 1:** I happened to wake up around 4:30am, and I stayed awake until 5am when my next doses of meds were due. I fell back asleep after. My back hurt a lot since I'm usually a side sleeper, so my boyfriend put down a heated blanket I then went on top of and that heat really helped relax my muscles. When I woke up later that morning, a lot of the pressure feeling I had before had subsided. Yes, there is a lot of farting as the gas is leaving. Later that day, when it actually got to the point when I felt like I needed pain meds, we were 2 hours past the interval point so I just took Tylenol instead of the oxy. I still took zofran then too, but that was the last one I needed to take. I was able to eat a little more this day by the evening. I had my boyfriend go get me some basic chicken noodle soup and graham crackers to snack on. I did go downstairs and sit at the kitchen table to drink the soup, although my boyfriend had to push/pull the chair I was in since I didn't have the strength to do it. I was also allowed to shower now, so that evening my boyfriend helped me take a shower since there was no way I could reach my legs, and there was also a lot of sticky residue from the EKG pads, IV holder, etc. that he had the strength to scrub at that I didn't. I had gotten a non-slip mat for the shower, and we luckily had a built in seat in our shower so I could sit. I took another round of Tylenol before I went to sleep for the night. I was bleeding slightly, but much less than my periods had.

**Day 2:** I felt a huge improvement. I started to use my phone to tell people I was alive, etc. I had a wedge pillow already, so I sat up using that in bed most of the day. We had kept the cats out the prior day since I was sleeping so much, but since I was awake and sitting up I let them in and just kept a regular pillow over my stomach if they tried to walk around there. I ended up only taking some Motrin before bed to get comfortable, but otherwise I was not in much pain. I also took some GasX. I started taking Miralax and Colace this day. I figured with the lack of eating the prior days, I didn't have much in my system anyway but would prep for when I finally would. I did a very small walk around a park in my neighborhood. It was also Halloween, so I sat outside for awhile to meet neighbors and see costumes. I finally went inside when I got cold and I started shivering because the shivering was painful. Showered again before bed, still kept scrubbing at the leftover adhesives.

**Day 3:** Another huge improvement. I went for a longer walk around a couple blocks in my neighborhood. I didn't take any pain meds this day. Took another round of Miralax and Colace. I also realized I needed some way to shower by myself if needed, so I bought a loofah on a long handle off Amazon to be delivered in a few days. I had a plain lunch but I had a somewhat regular sized dinner. This is also when I started coughing from my throat being sore. There was a small specific spot that was triggering it, so I think maybe the breathing tube scratched me there. I drank a lot of tea with honey and started sucking on cough drops like crazy. I kept trying to roll onto my side but it felt like it was tugging on my incisions so I couldn't do it. I also cried a lot that night and couldn't sleep, just processing everything it took to get to this point. I also passed a small clot-like thing that night, which afterwards I finally stopped bleeding.

**Day 4:** I woke up feeling absolutely awful. Like, concerned I was sick awful. I took my temperature, completely normal. So I took some Tylenol and Motrin regularly on this day and did pretty much nothing. I drank more tea with honey and sucked more cough drops. If I spoke more than about 2 sentences, I'd go into a coughing fit so I didn't speak much at all.

**Day 5:** Woke up much better. Finally had my morning coffee instead of just a tea with honey. My muscles were getting very sore/stiff even with the heated blanket, so we took our foam insert off the bed to see if that helped and it actually did quite a bit. I also did some very very light kickboxing (basically what we do to warm up in my gym except the things like squats and crunches of course!) to get my body moving and that really helped too. I went on two decent walks around the neighborhood. Still no luck with bowel movements, so I took Colace and Miralax again plus drank a Smooth Move senna tea right before bed. I also ate a homemade bibimbap dinner with tons of vegetables to add even more fiber to the mix. This was also the last day I took pain meds, just some Tylenol before bed. I was determined to fall asleep on my side. I found the trick was to tuck some pillow/blankets under my stomach, since it was quite swollen still and it needed support. Since I hadn't bled in >24 hours at this point, I switched to regular underwear instead of the disposable ones.

**Day 6:** As I was drinking my morning coffee, I finally felt the need to poop. I used just a single step stool to prop my feet up and had absolutely no pain or issues with it. I went again about an hour after that. My swelling went significantly down after that. Still able to sleep on my side.

**Day 7-13:** I've been taking it easy. I've been going on longer walks (well, except the days we got snowed in here in Denver!). I'm doing a little kickboxing. I've been doing coloring books and binging TV shows. Around day 10 is when laughing stopped hurting so that widened what shows I could watch, and it's also when I started leaving the bedroom door open to let the cats sleep with me which has gone ok. I had a busy day 12 going out for brunch with friends then spending the rest of the day decorating the house for Xmas. I had a friend help my boyfriend take all the boxes etc. out so I wasn't lifting anything, but I helped put ornaments on the tree etc. I also started bending down and being able to pick things up off the floor. I was pretty wiped out that evening but didn't need pain meds. Felt a little sore the next day so I just took it easy. Over the course of this week I have had some dull aches where I'm assuming my cuff is, but nothing pain medicine worthy. My appetite also has ramped up significantly and I am eating huge meals with snacks in between. I'm drinking some protein shakes as well to help with healing.

Today is day 14 for me, and I still feel great. I just can't believe how much pain I was in, and how little pain I am in now!!

My current planned return to work date is December 2. It's slightly longer than 4 weeks, but when we looked at the calendar, it showed my return date as the Wednesday before Thanksgiving so my doctor said there was no point in returning that day and wrote it out for the following Monday. I only have a 4 week post-op appointment, and it'll be on that Wednesday before Thanksgiving. I expect to still be on some restrictions through mid-December, which I'm going to personally extend to January. My doctor was pretty insistent I should be able to do anything I want to do after 6 weeks, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. And no real point in trying to get back into my workout routine the week before the holidays kick off anyway.

Hopefully this helps give a better guide/insight into the first two weeks of recovery you might experience. Please feel free to ask me questions!",6,1731444706.0,hysterectomy,4,1.0,False

We chatted a bit at lunch and on the way to training and even when her friends were there, she would talk almost exclusively to me, we teased each other a bit back and forth (nothing risky, mainly calling each other nerdy in creative ways). She also kept laughing at most things I said, even if they weren't really intended as jokes. I thought things were going well and was planning on asking her if she wanted to go for coffee this week. 

Now, due to bad luck, I didn't get to speak to her for a couple days until today and for some reason, it all feels different all of a sudden. We talked and she barely seemed interested in what I was saying or answering my questions and at training, it even seemed like she was trying to avoid me. We started warming up together but after a few minutes, she just wandered off to keep warming up with someone else. I honestly don't know whether I did something to make her uncomfortable, but I haven't even made any kind of move yet.

  
I don't know whether I should just consider today an off day and see whether things go back to normal, go for some kind of hail Mary confession (probably a terrible idea), or back off and try to get over her.

1gpux5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/aitaweddings/comments/1gpux5u/aita_for_cutting_off_a_bridesmaid/,AITA for cutting off a bridesmaid?,"Sorry for the long post ahead.

I (28F) have been friends with Jenna (28F) and Hannah (28F) since high school. I considered Jenna (I knew her first) my oldest and dearest friend even though life had gotten pretty crazy lately and we didn’t see each other as often as before. Neither of us are the type to text first but we always made it a point to catch up one in a while, or on special occasions like birthdays or holidays. 

During college Hannah and Jenna moved into the city near our campus and were so close that at times I even felt like the outcast. They were roommates though so I tried my best to not let that get in the way of my friendship with them. Hannah and Jenna had a falling out a few years ago (story for another day) but I wasn’t involved in that fallout so I remained impartial and stayed friends with both of them. Jenna has since moved away to a suburban city, and I have moved into the city to pursue my career. 

Hannah and I live fairly close by. I even stayed with her during my search for an apartment when I first moved here. She is the more extraverted type so she always asks to go out for drinks, or grab a coffee. Naturally when my bf (now fiancee) and I started talking about marriage we talked a lot more about vision, dress style, and all the other small details. Because of all this when my fiancee proposed I asked her to be my MOH. This decision was also influenced by the fact Hannah knew all the other bridesmaids in person because some of them were friends Jenna did not know. 

Now, whenever I met Jenna, I made it a point to be careful to not mention Hannah’s name to her. I knew she wasn’t comfortable with it and tried my best to keep our conversations focused around her and I. Last night I went to Jenna’s town to see her and I asked her to be a bridesmaid. She was thrilled at first but when we started talking wedding planning, I mentioned that Hannah is the MOH and she will get in touch with all the other bridesmaids to create a group chat. We had a good talk and I was so happy with the wedding planning that maybe I didn’t see her discomfort, but nothing happened in person and we both went home.

That night she called me and cried to me calling me selfish for not telling her in advance that Hannah was my MOH. She said she wouldn’t have said yes to being a bridesmaid had she known Hannah would be a part of the bridal party, let alone a MOH. She then proceeded to tell me that she can’t truly be happy for me on my engagement and wedding knowing that I am “choosing” Hannah over her. 

I tried to explain to her my reasoning of why Hannah is my MOH, that the role is not just about closeness and being a “best friend” but it is also a responsibility that I thought she would carry out best. Checking in on parents, coordinating events, etc were all pieces that I felt she was the right person for. This didn’t make sense for her and then she proceeded to tell me that she no longer wants to be a bridesmaid because I hurt her. I hurt her because I chose Hannah and didn’t respect Jenna enough to tell her this before hand. I honestly don’t think telling her anything in advance would have changed anything. Since then Jenna has made the decision to go no contact and told me I can do whatever I want in terms of contacting her. She doesn’t care if I block her or reach out, but whether she responds or not will be on her terms. She also mentioned that I am hurting her by alienating her just to “get back” at her for feeling outcasted in college. Although I was hurt by this comment because it showed how she thinks of me, I still loved her and decided to let it go because emotions are heightened. I told her the bridesmaid position will always be hers and my door is always going to be open to talk. 

Now, you should know that the ONE time I was “involved” in their fall out was when Hannah started talking about their fall out negatively to another friend and I overheard. I told Jenna this and asked her to keep my name out of it at first but then a few days later I confronted Hannah to tell her what she did was very wrong and she should apologize. 

Jenna is now reaching out to Hannah, telling her she is “re-evaluating” my friendship, and she thinks their fallout was escalated because I told her Hannah was talking behind her back and basically drove a wedge between them. She made it sound like I told her one story and Hannah another, but I had receipts to prove that wasn’t the case. 

I am now infuriated that she is trying to throw ME to the flame for their fallout. I tried to remain as composed and gracious about this as possible but I no longer want someone who can’t be happy for me in my bridal party.

i was dating a guy here before moving and my friends were just his friend group (big mistake i know now). we ended stuff pretty soon after i got settled (mutual and on good terms) and though my new girl friends were really nice at first they slowly stopped responding which i understood since they had known my ex for years, and i stopped pressing on getting closer.  

over the last like month or so ive noticed random people who associated with that group started unfollowing me (but keeping me as a follower which is fucking annoying) or ignoring me if i slid up on a story post and someone drunkenly confessed to me at a party that people didn’t like me because i was a “slut.” apparently one of my first girl friends here started telling people i was trying to hook up with her boyfriend the first day i was single, that i stopped talking to everyone, and that just causes so much drama for people who try to be my friend. 

none of this is true. like at all. as in most of our conversations between me and this girl are documented on text where it’s me asking if she’s free or wants to get coffee and i met the guy once during my exes birthday. i didn’t even know his name until this story was told to me. i feel like this is some huge joke or bit and like im on a tv show, and when i went to go text her about what was happening i found id been blocked on everything.

i know this is probably an annoying post but ive never dealt with someone making up entire scenarios about me before. when the person at the party was sober i reached out and asked if i could talk to them and i found out she has diagnosed bipolar disorder and did stuff like this in high school, but i feel like a bunch of random people i would’ve gotten along with in this new place now hate me and i have no idea where to begin remedying it. i went to ask my ex and found out i was blocked as well (im assuming from this situation) so i’ve felt alone and insane. what the fuck ",9,1731444089.0,rs_x,6,0.91,False

This is more of a rant/open to contribution and discussion but I need somewhere to vent this and I feel there are many people in here who may have had similar experiences and hopefully be comforted that they aren’t alone. (Sorry mods if this isn’t allowed)

I’m 22 and have struggled with anxiety since I was 18 (I’ve always been subject to it but 18 was when it started intensely). I had a MAJOR panic attack, I thought I was having a heart attack and was rushed to hospital. They misdiagnosed me with a heart condition and for a month straight I felt sick and dizzy. They did more tests and finally said that they misdiagnosed and that they no longer believed I had a heart problem and that it was actually intense anxiety. 

From this I’ve developed serious health anxiety where I constantly feel like I’m somehow going to die. Chest pain? Lung cancer. Stomach cramp? Heart related issues. Headache? Brain tumour. You get the idea. But I’m left in a constant state of what feels like wooziness, nausea. This in itself makes me doubt the anxiety itself and makes me worried that perhaps the doctors did miss something and I’m actually in the early stages of heart failure or lung disease. (Even though I’ve been back and forth to the doctors multiple times to have bloods taken etc all with them coming back clear. 

After my first panic attack and false diagnosis I went T total on everything. No more coffee. No more cigarettes. No more alcohol. No more 🌿. I started vaping just for something but vape on the lowest nicotine quantity.

Despite all this, the worst of it all is the physical symptoms. Most occur even when im not consciously anxious or having a panic attack. The shortness of breath, the air hunger, the dizziness, the dissociation, the nausea, the overall gloom and feeling on edge. This all make health anxiety worse because I worry these symptoms are actually a serious illness. I wish I could just vape and not think my lungs will fall out and collapse or that I’ll die of a heart attack etc.

I just wish I could enjoy life and stop thinking I’ll die at every turn. It’s absolutely exhausting.

I tried CBT and therapy and I’m thinking of going back now.

Has anyone else had any similar experiences? How did you cope? Did you take any steps to seek help and how so?

TL;DR
Intense health anxiety is exhausting. Physical symptoms of anxiety make me feel that they aren’t anxiety and it’s a serious Illness. I cut all vices out my life and now only vape low nicotine percentage and wish I could just enjoy it without feeling like I’m going to die. Any shared experience or advice much appreciated

1gpup9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1gpup9c/minor_dav_spoilers_my_mixed_but_somehow_good/,[Minor DAV Spoilers] My Mixed But Somehow Good Experience with The Veilguard,"It was quite the mixed experience. On one hand it was some of the best Dragon Age has been and on the other it was the worst.

The main story had an interesting enough premise and they did some cool things with it by the end of the game. But there were many chapters where very little happened except recruiting companions and rehashing the same plot points again and again. The Weisshaupt chapter was incredible. Easily one of the best for me. The ending was also really well done and was Mass Effect 2 suicide mission level of epic.

The choices and consequences were pretty well done in this entry especially the decision to save which city and how that decision completely changes the 2 faction’s quests afterward. The final quests also had a lot of suicide mission-esque decisions where companions can die so you also have to choose very carefully. Those final 4 hours were very well done and were very satisfying.

One of the best parts of the game was the Dread Wolf side quests and the lore revealed through them. It finally answered a ton of questions I had about the elven gods and the darkspawn origins. That part was very well done and I came away mostly satisfied except for one part about the Titans and blight which felt stupid. 

I did hate how a lot of lore seemed to be modified or not honored. Maybe I missed something. Like how they were making the blight seem like a zombie virus. People were turning into darkspawn after they were infected instead of just straight dying like in the Joining etc. There were a fair couple things like that just felt wrong. I thought the neon lights in parts of Dock Town was just off, how the Qunari had mortar guns, and all the elven artifacts the Veil Jumpers were hunting seemed more technologically advanced than the Dragon Age universe had previously given off. That stuff was just weird to me and it felt like it didn’t belong in the Dragon Age universe.

The tone of the game was just really off as well. From the art style to the dialogue and people’s motivations everything felt “soft”. Like the Antivan Crows. They’re assassins who kill for money but they are portrayed as protectors of Antiva instead delving into some of the more darker side of them. Or how in Tevinter you don’t see elves treated like crap. The tone of everything felt a little off. It felt sufficiently dark at times but almost like the devs were too scared to get too dark either certain aspects like racism and other things.

And the same for the dialogue. Man that was some of the worst dialogue I’ve ever heard. Everything either retreaded the same ground in previous conversations, recapped things, or was used to try to lighten the mood in a Marvel kind of way but it just didn’t land. It was very juvenile writing and I really missed the well written dialogue from previous games especially in something as well written as Inquisition party banter. Not all of it was bad and there was some good dialogue writing but it was mostly eclipsed by the bad.

The music was weird for me personally. All I could usually hear was synth music and it just felt really weird, almost like it belonged in Mass Effect than in Dragon Age. I didn’t care for just about a single song but I’ll have to give it a listen outside the game because maybe I was too focused on the game to hear the good songs.

The faction side quests could be pretty good. There was a lot of filler side quests but most took you to some cool places on the map and had some fun fights. And then there were some really incredible side quests. The side quests involving demons were usually really good. In particular there was this side quest involving an echo in a well that was just so creepy and good. A mysterious voice in a haunted castle. A demon locked away that to access you had to kill three manifestations of it elsewhere. The final quest for most factions were usually pretty well written too. Even though the side quest quality wasn’t what I wanted they were all focused on companions and factions and Dread Wolf memories that I have to appreciate how much of a step up it was from Inquisition’s fetch quests.

The combat was pretty fun. It was repetitive but when I turned down enemy health I had a pretty good time. The exploration was also really fun. I had a great time going after all the chests and statues even though the puzzles were usually very simple and not challenging. I kind of liked the mindless yet somehow still engaging exploration and that was a big highlight personally. It wasn’t as mindless as going after all the ? on a map but not nearly as exhausting as exploring in something like Breath of the Wild where you have to use your brain.

Now the companions. They were a mixed bag for me. I liked the companions for the most part and they had some decent companion quests but some just had very poorly written scenes or an overt focus on things that weren’t the best choice.

Neve was the best. I loved her personality, her voice acting, and the overall vibe she had. She was easily the best written companion and I liked her relationship with another companion, it was really cute. I liked how her hopelessness with Dock Town’s state could turn into hope depending on your choices with her. I do feel like her quest (and the Shadow Dragons quest) had a major missed opportunity for not focusing on the Magesterium though. We hardly saw any magisters at all and we were in freaking Tevinter! I feel like that should have been a given. Or on something like elven slavery or the Black Divine. Her and the Shadow Dragons quests weren’t bad but they weren’t great and missed good opportunities set up from previous entries and books.

Harding was great and really cheerful. I wish they would have flushed her personality out a bit more in her companion quests but her quest was about her ability and it was pretty cool getting to go a lost dwarven city for it. The reveal about the Titans, her wrestling with how to feel about it, and the choice you can make at the end for her was good. Personally I wish we could have seen more development in how upbeat she is in a depressing world. Maybe that’s just me

Davrin’s quest line had major problems for me and was maybe the worst. As someone who read the book Last Flight, the way they portrayed his antagonist made no sense in connection with the book. Like the book character went through this whole arc about wrestling with blood magic and hating what it did to the griffins and saved some griffin eggs. But then they decided to make that character want to use blood magic on the adolescent griffins from the eggs she saved in this game. Like what the heck. Davrin was a decent character though and I liked him even though his scenes of being an overly protective parent of Assan were pretty poorly written. I wish his scenes and his quest line did him more justice than that because I really liked him.

Bellara was really great. I started off annoyed by how she was written as well as her personality but grew to appreciate it because it’s how she coped from a traumatic experience. Seeing her open up and realizing why she is the way she is was pretty deep and I appreciated that a lot. I wish we could have seen her grow more in confidence but oh well. She was also very kind and cute and I ended up romancing her and she had a pretty well written romance especially if you choose to assign her to something in the final part of the main story. Her character development was a highlight for me. Her quest line was pretty poor imo and felt rushed, poorly written, or something. Still didn’t taint my experience with Bellara though.

I liked Emmerich. And surprisingly to me I liked Manfred too at the end when you make a certain choice. I liked getting to see this Mourn Watch side of necromancy through Emmerich’s companion quest where he lights candles and places flowers in the graveyard. It was cool to see that side. I really didn’t care for his antagonist but I really liked the choice that you have to make at the end for him and it was pretty tough. I thought his scenes (like the Harding and Emmerich book argument) made him seem pretty childish which was strange to see in the oldest party member. I mean he obviously has some social deficits but I don’t think they did him justice either in those scenes.

Lucanis was very obtuse to me which is super sad because he had a lot of potential. I liked that he had a love for coffee and cooking and obviously a big part of his character is Strife but still it was sad that his conversations didn’t focus on just about anything but those 3 things. I think there was so much more to his character than that which makes these surface level things feel like such a weird focus. I loved his recruitment mission a lot and he had an incredible final 2 quests for his arc. His were some of the best missions but I feel like he hardly developed other than getting over tensions with Davrin. And we also didn’t see Strife get resolved which was disappointing. 

Taash has been a big focus of criticism and I agree somewhat. I thought the coming out moment and the journey could have been handled with more depth and care. But I did appreciate the Qunari vs Rivaini choices for them as that would be challenging especially with the expectations of a parent. I thought their quest was pretty half baked until the final quest where it picked up and turned more interesting. Taash also had the most childish dialogue of everyone which was just sad for me. They definitely could made Taash more deep than wanting to punch stuff and hunting dragons. Obviously discovering yourself and coming out is deep but Im talking more of a nuanced personality that doesn’t follow the tropes. Seeing them awkward around their romanceable companion was funny and I appreciated those lighthearted scenes of Taash. Also the Lords of Fortune faction were incredibly underbaked and almost nonexistent in the finale.

Can’t believe I went on for this long. I had way too many thoughts on this game because it’s Dragon Age I apparently care a lot. Overall it was incredible and terrible at the same time. Objectively with all my issues with it it should be a 7/10 but my enjoyment level somehow is more like a 8.5/10. It feels very different from the other Dragon Age games but still feels like a pretty good entry. I didn’t love it but I did enjoy my time with it quite a bit and am just happy to have gotten another Dragon Age game.",3,1731443630.0,dragonage,4,0.81,False

I’m a 36-year-old woman from Central Europe whose native language is German, looking for someone I can genuinely connect with. Friendship is great, but I’m here to find a partner who’s open to building something meaningful. If we find we’re not quite right for each other, I’m open to friendship too, but my primary intention is a lasting relationship.

A little about me: I’m 185 cm tall (6’1”), curvy, and I have a pretty sharp sense of humor that’ll keep you on your toes. Audiobooks, especially crime thrillers, are my go-to escape. And yes, I’ll be the one secretly piecing together clues in my head and probably getting it wrong half the time. When I’m not solving imaginary mysteries, I’m usually out hiking with my dog, planning a new trip, or winding down with knitting and a coffee (or tea, depending on my mood).

Travel is something I love, especially to the north. For me, a great trip involves exploring cities, breathing in sea air, and finding those off-the-beaten-path spots—not baking on a beach for ten days. That said, I also appreciate a good cozy night in, just as much as an adventure.

A few practical details: I’ve never been married, I don’t have kids, and I’m not looking to change that. Physical appearance isn’t a big deal for me; I’m drawn to intelligence, wit, and a great conversation that can go in any direction. If you’re someone who knows how to connect and keep it real—and don’t mind a tall woman with a laid-back approach—we might just get along.

If this sounds interesting and you’re up for some genuine conversation, send me a message with more than just a “hi.” I’d love to hear about you, your passions, and what you’re looking for in a connection. Let’s see where it goes!

The studio has a somewhat narrow rectangular layout, which is proving to be tricky because the opposite wall from the living room is fully taken up by my kitchen and workspace. I can’t really rearrange things, so I’m working with this setup as is. I’m looking for advice on a few key areas:
	1.	Coffee Table: I’m not sure what type of coffee table would work here. I don’t want it to feel too “visually heavy” since there’s already a lot of brown in the space. I’m torn on material and shape—any suggestions?
	2.	Lighting: The place is pretty dark, especially with no window near the couch. I’d love to add some ambient, cozy lighting, but I’m not sure where to start. Would a lamp by the TV, behind the couch, or somewhere else make the most sense? With my bed right next to the couch, I’d love ideas for lighting that works for both areas without overdoing it.
	3.	Wall Decor & Shelving: The walls feel very bland. Should I consider shelves in the living area, or is there another way to bring in personality without cluttering the space?

My style leans towards a mix of mid-century modern and maybe a little bit modern/eclectic—I’m aiming for cozy but not overcrowded. If anyone has ideas for lighting options and placement, coffee table styles, or general decor tips, I’d really appreciate it!

1gpugrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gpugrj/aita_for_cutting_off_my_friend_of_over_10_years/,AITA for cutting off my friend of over 10 years?,"Sorry for the long post ahead.

I (28F) have been friends with Jenna (28F) and Hannah (28F) since high school. I considered Jenna (I knew her first) my oldest and dearest friend even though life had gotten pretty crazy lately and we didn’t see each other as often as before. Neither of us are the type to text first but we always made it a point to catch up one in a while, or on special occasions like birthdays or holidays. 

During college Hannah and Jenna moved into the city near our campus and were so close that at times I even felt like the outcast. They were roommates though so I tried my best to not let that get in the way of my friendship with them. Hannah and Jenna had a falling out a few years ago (story for another day) but I wasn’t involved in that fallout so I remained impartial and stayed friends with both of them. Jenna has since moved away to a suburban city, and I have moved into the city to pursue my career. 

Hannah and I live fairly close by. I even stayed with her during my search for an apartment when I first moved here. She is the more extraverted type so she always asks to go out for drinks, or grab a coffee. Naturally when my bf (now fiancee) and I started talking about marriage we talked a lot more about vision, dress style, and all the other small details. Because of all this when my fiancee proposed I asked her to be my MOH. This decision was also influenced by the fact Hannah knew all the other bridesmaids in person because some of them were friends Jenna did not know. 

Now, whenever I met Jenna, I made it a point to be careful to not mention Hannah’s name to her. I knew she wasn’t comfortable with it and tried my best to keep our conversations focused around her and I. Last night I went to Jenna’s town to see her and I asked her to be a bridesmaid. She was thrilled at first but when we started talking wedding planning, I mentioned that Hannah is the MOH and she will get in touch with all the other bridesmaids to create a group chat. We had a good talk and I was so happy with the wedding planning that maybe I didn’t see her discomfort, but nothing happened in person and we both went home.

That night she called me and cried to me calling me selfish for not telling her in advance that Hannah was my MOH. She said she wouldn’t have said yes to being a bridesmaid had she known Hannah would be a part of the bridal party, let alone a MOH. She then proceeded to tell me that she can’t truly be happy for me on my engagement and wedding knowing that I am “choosing” Hannah over her. 

I tried to explain to her my reasoning of why Hannah is my MOH, that the role is not just about closeness and being a “best friend” but it is also a responsibility that I thought she would carry out best. Checking in on parents, coordinating events, etc were all pieces that I felt she was the right person for. This didn’t make sense for her and then she proceeded to tell me that she no longer wants to be a bridesmaid because I hurt her. I hurt her because I chose Hannah and didn’t respect Jenna enough to tell her this before hand. I honestly don’t think telling her anything in advance would have changed anything. Since then Jenna has made the decision to go no contact and told me I can do whatever I want in terms of contacting her. She doesn’t care if I block her or reach out, but whether she responds or not will be on her terms. She also mentioned that I am hurting her by alienating her just to “get back” at her for feeling outcasted in college. Although I was hurt by this comment because it showed how she thinks of me, I still loved her and decided to let it go because emotions are heightened. I told her the bridesmaid position will always be hers and my door is always going to be open to talk. 

Now, you should know that the ONE time I was “involved” in their fall out was when Hannah started talking about their fall out negatively to another friend and I overheard. I told Jenna this and asked her to keep my name out of it at first but then a few days later I confronted Hannah to tell her what she did was very wrong and she should apologize. 

Jenna is now reaching out to Hannah, telling her she is “re-evaluating” my friendship, and she thinks their fallout was escalated because I told her Hannah was talking behind her back and basically drove a wedge between them. She made it sound like I told her one story and Hannah another, but I had receipts to prove that wasn’t the case. 

I am now infuriated that she is trying to throw ME to the flame for their fallout. I tried to remain as composed and gracious about this as possible but I no longer want someone who can’t be happy for me in my bridal party.

1gpugj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeachers/comments/1gpugj0/inappropriate_behavior_from_former_high_school/,Inappropriate behavior from former high school teacher,"Hi everyone, 

Not sure if this even belongs here, just thought I might get some opinions from people who work in the teaching field. I am 24 years old, and I get coffee with my former high school history teacher (from 11th grade, so about seven years ago) about twice a year. He was a role model for me in high school, and was really supportive of me when my family wasn't. I never felt like he crossed any boundaries when I was his student - he never tried to hang out with me outside of school, never talked to me inappropriately, and was in general a really upstanding guy. The last time we met up (in a public place, not sure if this makes it worse or better), he was telling me about how he is undergoing couples therapy with his wife. He had mentioned this before, and had vaguely mentioned that a big issue in their relationship was the lack of intimacy between him and his wife. This made me feel very uncomfortable, but he didn't go into detail - until the other day. He told me some details that I don't even feel comfortable repeating here (namely, the fact that they no longer have penetrative sex). It made me so uncomfortable, I ended up cutting our meeting short by saying I had to go to work. Am I overreacting? I know I'm an adult now, and I've never once felt he was making advances on me, but I am genuinely at a loss for how to handle this. He followed up with me over Facebook messenger saying how much he enjoyed our conversation, and I'm tempted to message him back and set some boundaries. I just didn't think I'd ever be in a position where I'd have to let him know not to do something like that. Thanks for reading, let me know if anyone has any helpful advice.

1gpufz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1gpufz2/my_husband_cheated_and_left_me/,My husband cheated and left me,"
Hello! My husband and I have been together for 6.5 years, married for 1.5 years. He's 29, I'm 30. Last Friday, he sat down with me after morning coffee and announced that he felt he couldn't fulfill himself with me and that he had fallen out of love with me, which was a long process. He then announced that he cheated on me with one of his colleagues, who is 10 years older than him, and that she also has a child. Since then, I haven't regained consciousness, I'm having a wave of feelings. Sometimes I'm fine, sometimes I'm completely on the ground.

Then we met again on Sunday, which I initiated. He sobbed all the way there, said that he loved me very much, but he was no longer enthusiastic about things together, and that this woman was very understanding and loved him. The relationship has been going on for a total of 2 weeks, but I heard that my husband has liked her for a longer time since August. After that we layed together for hours and kissed each other, my husband was completely upset by this, but in the end he left again because he said he wanted to be with this woman. I heared from her mother that after the breakup he kept asking her about me, what I could do, what could happen to me, he was worried about me, and he also repeated to her that he loves me very much, but he can't make me happy.

I was totally confused after that because I thought it was a sign that this was just a low point, because this woman was just a consequence of something, we didn't pay enough attention to each other, and I was ready to fix our marriage.

But the other day I found out that they went abroad on a work trip, where they already slept in a hotel room, so I was on the ground again.

Has anyone been in a similar situation?

My husband and I did a lot of things together, we ran, hiked, and worked on joint projects, which is why I unfortunately don't understand the lack of fulfillment. I would ask him this too, but he doesn't give a concrete answer to anything, he feels that he can't find himself in this relationship, or anywhere, and everything is uncertain.

I can't process this sudden change at the moment, because last week we were on a hike together, and everything seemed fine.

YES, I know things would be cheaper if I could either cook regularly, or cook in big batches, but these things are not realistic for me. It's taken years of going to bed hungry to avoid cooking and wasting tons of food to accept that it isn't realistic for me. I've guilted myself plenty over the years, it does not help.

I am not in so bad a position that I need to count every penny, so I'm willing to sacrifice some money to make sure that I eat regularly - which has been an ongoing issue for years. I need to take care of my health first, which unfortunately means I need to spend a little more on food and medications than most people probably do.

-

Okay preface aside, I'm getting sick of oatmeal every day. I need some alternative zero effort but affordable food ideas.

Right now I bring oatmeal to work, and cook it in the paper coffee cups they have there. I'm at work for 10-ish hours, and then I go home and usually eat canned soup. This winds up being about $3-$5 worth of food a day? Depending on if it's a ✨Fancy✨ soup or not.

I can afford more than this, but I feel really guilty spending money, so I try not to. Anything I don't eat becomes savings, and then I start skipping meals to save, and... I'm working on that problem, money guilt is kinda hard to overcome, but that's why I had to preface that my health has to come before money. It's been hard for me to accept that fact, and I'm still learning.

Other foods I keep around:
- Trail Mix (can also be added to oatmeal)
- Cereals (Can't eat this at work unfortunately, and I often do not want it for dinner. It usually becomes weekend brunch.)
- Ramen packets (I have a hard time finding the energy to cook these, so I might pay the extra 30-50 cents and go back to the cups of ramen. Also you can crunch up the noodles and add them to salads or pretend they're weird foreign chips and just eat them plain.)
- Potatoes (Can be cooked and eaten at work, but they cool down very quickly and I can't leave my station to reheat it, so potatoes are only for long lunch breaks since I really cannot stand room temperature potatoes...)
- Bananas (Eaten plain or added to oatmeal. Technically I'm allergic to bananas, but only the skins, and not enough that I've ever needed to worry about it. Any banana could be my last tho if the allergy gets worse. Probably still worth the risk.)
- Lunch meat (to be eaten plain, I can't do bread for some reason, my brain doesn't allow it, but at least if it's just the slices I can eat it at my station. Just gets kinda gross warm.)
- Probably at least 2 other things I've forgotten and will feel silly about forgetting

Anyone have any more ideas for food that can be eaten in the car/at work with minimal effort? Things that can be tossed in the microwave or can be nibbled on throughout the day?

I've eaten so much oatmeal, it's so cheap, but I really need another breakfast at work idea before I lose my mind. It doesn't even have to be breakfast, I just need to be able to eat it without looking at it and have basically 0 risk of it spilling if I bump it with my very clumsy arm (this is why I can't have cereal at work.)

I feel like I have to be forgetting something obvious here.",0,1731442911.0,povertyfinance,5,0.4,False

Now for the fun stuff

**Optimization** \- Easily EA/Biowares best release in a long time where optimization is concerned. From stalking the forums, I know bugs exist. But I didn't run into any. The only time noticed any frame rate loss was near a very large waterfall. ***9/10***

**Graphics** \- Amazing. The scenery looks beautiful, the characters look even better. And the hair physics are the best I have seen in any released game thus far. ***10/10***

**Combat** \- Combat is a complete change from previous games. The combat is very action based. You can ONLY control Rook on the battle field but you do have limited control of your parties abilities. Allowing for large combos between you or your teammates. Some may find it necessary to slow themselves down. You need to pay attention to the battlefield or you will find yourself being killed a lot. Block, dodge, attack. Wait for your openings. Once you get used to it, its very fast paced. For me, combat was amazing. And to be honest, I was not sure what to expect going in as Combat has evolved with each game. But for me this was a big hit. ***9/10***

**Gameplay** \- Gameplay is linear. If you played Dragon Age 2, you have a pretty good idea of what it is. The maps you are placed into feel rich and full. And the cities Triviso and Minrathou feel big but not too big. ***8/10***

**Companions** \- Each companion felt different and definitely brought something different to the table. Each has their own story line as well as a potential romance path. A small bit on each companion below. ***8/10***

*Harding - Quirky and adorable. Easily embarrassed. I was a big fan of Harding in inquisition, still am. Have always loved her outlook on life.* 

*Neve - Oh Neve, she brings a bit of noir to the scene. But there is much to be discovered. I expect her to be many a favorite*

*Bellara - She is sweet, innocent and quirky. But underneath this, you can tell she needs a gentle hand to help guide her.*

*Davrin - Davrin is great. Don't get me wrong. Excellent company. But Assan.. is amazing. Nothing I won't do for Assan.*

*Emmrich - Gotta say. When I first saw the trailer I thought he was going to be a stuck up jerk. I could not have been more wrong. Emmrich is lovable, relatable and in general. Just a good person from head to toe who happens to travel with a skeletal companion who is ALMOST as adorable as Assan. His story missions are among my favorite in the game.* 

*Lucanis - Dark, shadowy and mysterious. What more do you want. He is an assassin of the night and not afraid to admit it. He is more than willing to tell you some stories. So long as you bring the coffee.* 

*Taash - Ok, the dreaded one. The one many complain about. I don't want to give spoilers about her story. But I have to say. When I relaxed. And just played the game. It was not bad. In fact I found myself rather enjoying her story.* 

**Companion Dialogue** \- The random world dialogue between Rook and the Companions is on point. Some of the funnest Dialogue I found (I am sure I didn't find all of it) was between Taash and Emmrich. ***9/10***

***MC(Main Character)*** \- I didn't think I would need to add this. I generally don't. But I feel the need to as I don't think they have achieved this to this level before. As an example, in Inquisition you would be advised on what you needed to do next. Then you would do it. Veilguard is very different. You are not just the leader offering guidance on what needs to be done next. You are very clearly a role model for the team. Offering YOUR advice to them. They can and do offer advice. But its very clear you are the leader of this group and each companion is aware of it, and respects. The MC is also in general very knowledgeable with the events and lore around them. Leaving behind the days when a companion would have to explain every detail to you. Now you can explain it to them, giving them reasons as to why you are the leader. ***10/10*** 

**Story** \- The story follows the dreadwolf, this much I can say with out giving any spoilers. Beyond that, I enjoyed the world, as well as how companion and faction stories tied into it. The story was interesting and fun and sad at times, more than a few times I got emotional from the events happening on my screen. But there was something missing from it. I knew the events that were happening were world shattering with an outcome that could end EVERYTHING. I just didn't feel it. I felt what was happening to those around me, even in the cities. But around the world? Its clear they wanted us to feel these events effected the world whole. Which they did. It just didn't feel like it. **8/10**

I’m a 36-year-old woman from Central Europe whose native language is German, looking for someone I can genuinely connect with. Friendship is great, but I’m here to find a partner who’s open to building something meaningful. If we find we’re not quite right for each other, I’m open to friendship too, but my primary intention is a lasting relationship.

A little about me: I’m 185 cm tall (6’1”), curvy, and I have a pretty sharp sense of humor that’ll keep you on your toes. Audiobooks, especially crime thrillers, are my go-to escape. And yes, I’ll be the one secretly piecing together clues in my head and probably getting it wrong half the time. When I’m not solving imaginary mysteries, I’m usually out hiking with my dog, planning a new trip, or winding down with knitting and a coffee (or tea, depending on my mood).

Travel is something I love, especially to the north. For me, a great trip involves exploring cities, breathing in sea air, and finding those off-the-beaten-path spots—not baking on a beach for ten days. That said, I also appreciate a good cozy night in, just as much as an adventure.

A few practical details: I’ve never been married, I don’t have kids, and I’m not looking to change that. Physical appearance isn’t a big deal for me; I’m drawn to intelligence, wit, and a great conversation that can go in any direction. If you’re someone who knows how to connect and keep it real—and don’t mind a tall woman with a laid-back approach—we might just get along.

If this sounds interesting and you’re up for some genuine conversation, send me a message with more than just a “hi.” I’d love to hear about you, your passions, and what you’re looking for in a connection. Let’s see where it goes!

Happily so /
Why?

I texted:

I'm just wondering 🤔

He has seen it but hasn't replied.
I'm not sure on what to do, in fact I'm kind of lost. Does he get the idea that I like him? Is him asking why a sign of some interest? Or did I not make it clear enough that I'm interested in him that way. Thing is maybe it wasn't the most direct way but I'm not sure if his reply of saying happily so even gives me a chance to let him know that I think we should get coffee sometime or something like that. I'm feeling conflicted and unsure of what to do next in terms of texting the guy something or if I should wait it out. I was advised that he's essentially processing this, as it did come off outta the blue/unexpected.


From my previous post:
We're both 20, I'm 20 (f) and he turned 20 some time ago. We met to sit down in person for something professional on my end, for a university assignment. I was all dolled up and made eye contact with him and was smiling the whole time, but this guy couldn't make eye contact with me the first hour together and he just seemed fidgety/twitchy or nervous when we sat down to talk. He went out for a couple smokes every now and then but after the first 40 min or so he looked a little more comfortable that he can make eye contact with me and even adjusted himself and his chair angling towards me. He always texts me back in an appropriate time and if he replies really late, in which case he did once, he'd apologize for it but he always texted within a reasonable time-frame and sometimes instantaneously. He never texts first and he only texted me first once to invite me to this event he was a part of since I went to one of his performances before when he was in my city. Do these things mean that he's a shy guy? Or emotionally unavailable? I don't take much note of it but he let me pay for his coffee when I offered, I mean he's doing me a favour if he agreed to sit down with me for this this talk we did for a university assignment even though we're not close but we would briefly text online sometimes. We go to different unis btw. He was really engaged in person though and although he's not a big texter and doesn't personally know me and I respect that he's realistic about those things, he did deliver and was on time about meeting with me even when he came to confirm with me again on the day of.",1,1731442551.0,AskMenAdvice,29,0.67,False

I remember many years ago reading that in the development of Sims 2, they internally had a version that was just 2D - the people were just circles, the rooms just squares. They used this mode to test game mechanics, and everyone at EA loved playing it. I've always wanted something like that.  All the depth and options of a Sims, but with far simpler graphics.

1gpu57l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMS/comments/1gpu57l/pms_survival_guide/,PMS survival guide,"Honestly, I try not to focus on my PMS so much because I find if I acknowledge it and then move on with my day, it ruins my life less. However, for times when it is really bad, I do have a list of tactics to make it more manageable.

Today I'm really struggling to stay productive and positive. So I thought I'd share my list with some other menstruating people! Hang in there everyone, we will make it to our periods together and feel so much better!

First off, I have been taking vitamin B12 every day for a few months and I've noticed a marked decrease in symptoms ever since. I think there's really something to it. But, beyond that:

1. **Have a list of things you aren't allowed to think about, if at all possible, until your period comes.** Like some of mine are politics, motherhood, certain relationship challenges I'm currently working through with people, and a few other upsetting issues about humanity or the world. I am allowed to tackle those topics during my happy weeks.
2. **I make sure to eat every two hours during the day** (and during this week I'm starving enough that I do need that frequency of feeding). I'm usually allowed only two ""cheat"" foods a week (the rest of what I eat has to be healthy and nourishing), but during premenstrual week I up it to four (plus plenty of nutrient dense food on top of it).
3. **The ""thirty"" rule.** If I'm feeling too sluggish to get my tasks done, I'll set a timer for 30 mins and do the task as best I can until the timer goes off. That way, at least, I will have made a little headway on everything and I'll feel a bit productive.

Also, if somebody or something is pissing me off and I feel the rage rising, I will breathe in for 10 seconds, hold for 10 seconds, out for 10 seconds. Repeat if needed, until the primal angst is gone.

4. **Compassionate sex.** Only really works if you have somebody to do this with. From my experience, not just any sex will help with PMS. In fact, casual or unfulfilling sex without emotional connection (which often ends in ghosting and rejection), will make things way worse. Ideally you could ask this of a safe partner with whom you have a close and emotionally receptive relationship. If you do have access to this, it helps so much.

5. **Asking other people to help you out.** I have really struggled with this. I have internalized misogyny against my body for doing this crap to me, for cutting my productivity and energy in the name of stupid, dumb childbearing. I have lived in denial that my PMS is a thing and tried to push through. But I notice it improves my relationship with my partner if I explain what's going on with my body and ask him to help me out with household things, make me a carb rich meal, go pick me up a coffee. Use this within reason, and respect others' needs, but if you can healthily communicate your need for help, do so.

6. **Eight hours of sleep per night at least!** I'm noticed that if I don't sleep during this time, I am SCREWED the next day. The rest of the month I have some leeway. Sometimes my work schedule makes it to where I can't sleep that much per night, and when it happens during my luteal phase, I just groan, knowing my mood will be totally unmanageable the next day. Even so, on days I have to be sleep deprived, I focus even more heavily on the tips provided above.

7. **L-theanine** helps me when I'm at work. 400 mg really cuts through the anxiety and rage and makes me not care about anything or anybody, which is very useful.

8. **Walks in nature,** without your phone if possible, can be quite helpful and calming. I like to watch birds and turn my brain off.

9. **Picture yourself as the strong, stable person you know you are (or want to become)**, and hold that image in mind when you feel a freak out coming on. That person doesn't act this way! And that person is inside of you.

10. **Yin yoga**, if you can find an hour of free time in the day, might really help. It helps me relax and ground myself.

11. **Make a list of songs you consider your power anthems**, and listen to them in the car or during breaks at work, to remind yourself how tough and strong you are. I like a lot of motivational rap, stuff by Lizzo and Bishop Briggs, and others.",5,1731442235.0,PMS,1,1.0,False
1gpu4v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoldenWrist/comments/1gpu4v3/lookalikes_or_homages_where_do_you_draw_the_line/,Lookalikes or Homages: Where Do You Draw the Line?,"1. ""The Great Debate: Lookalike vs. Homage""\*\*



Alright, so here’s the age-old debate: is a lookalike the same as an homage? And where the heck do we draw the line? Because every time I’m rocking my favorite timepiece, which \*may\* resemble a certain high-end brand, I feel like I’m on trial! One friend says, “Oh, that’s such a cool homage!” and another’s squinting, like, “Is that a fake?” Meanwhile, I’m just standing there, trying to remember if I bought it from a ""boutique"" website or \*that one\* seller online. 



2. ""The Homage That’s Just a Little \*Too\* Familiar""\*\*



Here’s where it gets tricky: when that homage is juuust a little too convincing. You know the type—it’s got the same dial, color scheme, and logo placement as the big brands, but somehow, it costs the same as three cups of fancy coffee. So, I ask myself, “Am I rocking a tribute to a classic design… or just wearing a lie?” But honestly, who am I fooling? It’s like putting a lion costume on your cat and calling it a king of the jungle. I know, they know, but we all just play along.



3. ""It’s Not Fake; It’s \*Inspired\*… I Think?""\*\*



So, I try to rationalize it: ""It’s not fake; it’s \*inspired!\*” After all, isn’t the sincerest form of flattery imitation? But there’s a fine line between a tasteful nod and a full-on doppelgänger. And every time I catch myself explaining this to someone, it sounds like I’m talking about a bad movie remake: “Yeah, it’s \*basically\* the same plot, but with different actors, you know?” My friends are like, “Uh-huh, and how’s that different from a knockoff?” And at this point, I’m getting ready to throw in the towel and just admit, “Yeah, it’s fake. I know. Let’s move on.” 



4. ""When Your Watch Has a Split Personality""\*\*



The real trouble comes when you meet someone who \*knows\* their watches. Suddenly, you’re sweating bullets. They’re like, “That’s a nice Submariner!” And you’re like, “Haha, yeah… uh… something like that!” I mean, how do you explain to a true collector that your watch has what I’d call a ‘split personality’? One day, it’s an “homage,” but when someone \*knowledgeable\* sees it, it’s just an imposter hoping no one notices. It’s like taking your cousin to prom and pretending they’re your date. You know it’s not quite right, but hey, it \*looks\* convincing, right?



5. ""The Accidental Brand Snob Confusion""\*\*



Then there’s that awkward moment when people treat you like a brand snob because they \*think\* it’s real. I once had a friend ask me if I could “recommend” them a luxury watch store. I’m like, “You mean… the website I got this from? It had a promo code!” But the pressure’s real. Suddenly, people are expecting me to have “taste” and “standards” in watches, and I’m just trying not to laugh because we’re talking about something I bought for less than a nice dinner.



6. ""Where Do We Really Draw the Line?""\*\*



So here’s my real question: where’s the line between “homage” and “fake”? I mean, does it depend on the price, or the brand, or just how much I \*believe\* in it? At the end of the day, I guess we each draw our own lines. Some draw it at the brand name, some at the craftsmanship, and for me? I draw it wherever my bank account decides. So I say, to each their own “inspired-by” piece! Just don’t ask me for a close-up.",1,1731442209.0,GoldenWrist,0,1.0,False
