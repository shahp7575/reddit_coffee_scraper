A coworker from another department, Tara(28F), has been chatting with me lately and kept hyping up her weekend book club. She specifically told me to come because they ""need someone who knows history"" and even asked what day works for me.

  
So I show up at the coffee shop at the time she suggested. I’m sitting there like a lost bookmark for almost an hour before anyone from the group arrives. When Tara finally walks in with two friends, Mia(27F) and Jess(30F), she barely acknowledges me. No ""hey you made it"" or anything. I try to join the conversation and it’s like I’m speaking in citations nobody asked for. Every time I add a comment, she gives a quick nod and immediately pivots back to inside jokes.

  
Mia(27F) was friendly and actually asked me questions, so I ended up talking to her more and discussing the book with whoever would engage. Still, it felt awkward because I was only there because Tara pushed so hard.

  
I’m not trying to psychoanalyze her, but I’m confused and annoyed. What’s a normal way to address this at work without making it dramatic?

1q74aig,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1q74aig/im_my_dads_least_favorite_his_words_yet_i_dont/,"I’m my dads least favorite, his words. Yet I don’t know why I still try to make him care for me","Trigger warning for domestic violence.

I’m 20 and live with my father still, this past year was the worst year of my life. My husband who I loved very much cheated on me and is still with his new lover, I had to move out quickly due to him getting aggressive with me. I’ve never had a real relationship with my dad growing up, he was absent most of the time and barley remembered to call or text and while he claims my mom withheld us from him I don’t buy it. 

But this past year I’ve also been trying to get closer to my dad, so when my husband was getting violent with me and I knew I had to leave quickly the first person I called was my father. My mom paid for my flight to leave and my father picked me up from the airport. 

In the beginning it was great, it felt like he really cared and was trying to help me gain my confidence back, he was taking me fun places, brought me with him when he was doordashing so I wouldn’t be lonely at the house and built me a bunk bed so I could stay in the same room with my 5 year old sister. It was really great until the 3rd month being there. He started getting more snappy over small stuff with me and started talking about how “old I look for my age” and about how “when I was your age I looked so young, but you look really old”. Basically he just started trying to put me down whenever he could but weirdly also complimenting himself in the same breath. It felt weird and at first I thought I was overreacting but now that I’m 7 months into living with him I know he’s doing it, I just don’t know why. Every chance he gets he reminds me of how talented and well liked he is and how I’m not. We argue quite frequently now too although I try to defuse before it goes too far, if I don’t it usually ends with him curling into a ball and crying or punching something. The last argument that really bothered me was about my little sister. 

Ever since I’ve been here i had been babysitting her and had to take very little hours at work, just so he could go back to work (he had been living off of disability before I came). I plan on getting a good job soon, I’ve been preparing the last 3 months and I told him abt how when I move out I could still babysit her from my apartment as long as he could drive her to me. But he started getting all cryptic and was like “dont worry about it, I already have a plan”. I asked him if he had found a different babysitter for her and he was like “stop asking abt it, I already said I have a plan” I got so confused by the sudden rudeness and questioned further and that caused him to scream at me that I never know when to stop and that I don’t shut up, I got upset and started yelling too and that argument ended with him punching my thermos and spilling coffee all over my lap. After that we both went quiet and I was just trying to focus on not crying. Finally we got to our house and he just told me “I don’t like you, I love you, because you’re my daughter, but I don’t like you. Just stop asking me stuff I can handle on my own from now on” and ushered me out of the car before he drove off for work. I just went to my room and cried. I know he said he loved me but it really feels like hate, especially with how he’s been pinning my little sister against me. In the beginning, he was trying to bring us closer and he would reprimand her whenever she was bad (mostly her kicking, hitting or throwing a tantrum when I don’t give her what she wants) but recently he almost encourages it and sometimes even starts it. 

Just today as my father was driving me to work I was playing a game with my little sister when my dad reached back and took her cat headband off her head and put it on his own, she kept trying to grab it but he’d swerve and at one point he said “your big sister told me to steal it from you” which caused her to turn to me and kick me before pouting, I grabbed it off of his head and handed it back to her and told her she knows that I wouldn’t do that and he said “baby who do you think is telling the truth” and she looked at both of us before deciding he was. My dad just laughed and my little sister kept pouting and trying to scratch me. I kept telling her she needed to be good and she told me “I just can’t be” and that caused my dad to laugh and tell her “good job” before she went back to trying to scratch me. It really made me feel like I had no one who cared, and I know it’s stupid because she’s still so young but I have a feeling she will genuinely never like me as she gets older. 

I genuinely think he hates me but I don’t know why, I’ve tried everything. I tried overachieving, I’ve tried helping him out, ive tried giving him space, I’ve tried straight up asking him how I can make him like me, but nothing works. It seems like he hates me more and more everyday yet I always find myself going to him for advice, I have other people in my life I could ask but I always go for him. I don’t know why I do, I’m always telling him abt my goals and dreams too even though he makes it obvious he’s not listening . 

The one time in this whole time I’ve been living here is when I briefly dated this woman, she was so sweet and adventurous , in my 3 months of dating her she showed me around the state and showed me all of the good spots to hang out, go clubbing, or just kill time together. I introduced her to my dad because I was over the moon. But her second time meeting my dad he ‘accidentally’ convinced her to breakup with me. She had no idea I was depressed, she knew abt my husband and our ongoing divorce and the whole backstory but part of the reason she liked me so much was because even after all that I was still so positive. I am depressed, I won’t lie, but I never told her, I just felt I should show her the very best of myself and eventually my sadness would go away, which it did start to with her. But he sat on my bed chatting with her and started drilling in how depressed I was. “Look at how messy her room is, if it weren’t for work she wouldn’t even leave her bed” “she’s always crying about something, she thinks she’s being secretive and that I can’t hear it but I do” “she was so depressed when she first got here I had to help pick her up” “you’re so nice and happy to be around, but she’s such a negative person, maybe you can make her nicer one day”. He said so much more but with everything he said I saw her getting more and more overwhelmed, she just kept politely laughing and looking at me. After that he guilt tripped her into helping me pick up my room even after I told her to please not and after an hour of helping she left, the next week she told me she had no idea I was so depressed and that with her also having depression it would be too much to handle and broke up with me. I was so upset I didn’t even know what to do. For 2 days I stewed on what to say to my dad, then finally when my little sister was at her moms house one day and he was driving me to work I told him how she broke up with me, and why. At first he didnt care or even pay attention to it until I told him I couldn’t trust him anymore. Then he got upset, he started yelling at me and told me it’s my fault for not telling her in the first place but I snapped and started crying and told him how there was no reason for me to tell her if it was something I was trying to fix and something she didn’t see. He tried arguing but when he saw me crying he tried hugging me, whenever I cry in an argument he tries to hug me yet never actually apologizes and I hate it. I told him I don’t want his hug and he just tried telling me how I shouldn’t blame him because “how was he supposed to know she would leave me over that”. I didn’t argue anymore and just went into my work when we arrived.
 

 I just wish I knew what to do, how do I stop talking to him about my life and asking for advice and care when all he has ever shown me at best was disinterest. Has anyone else ever lived through this before and been able to solve it? I don’t even know where to begin on what I should do, I feel so alone and dejected.

It should be noted that the expiration date for both of the suspect boxes is August of 2027, but the pod labels are very different. All are the Light Roast Coffee Breakfast blend.

As you all probably know 711 orders can be kind of awful due to the service & all the sketchy characters it attracts…. I showed the register guy my pickup & he waved me off to the pickup section. I go there & still get ignored by them. I go back up to him & ask uh is my order just not ready? He’s like no you have to go to the pickup section like I did buddy no one was there. Oh my god so anyways that gets the other employees attention & he finally helps me. I had to wait a minute for him to pack it but he points to the two bags & says that’s all. There’s a coffee cup next to the bags & it looks like he’s also motioning to the coffee cup so I thought that was part of the order. I actually couldn’t even see the contents of the order so don’t come at me for not checking!! I tell him ok I’m gonna take 2 trips since the bags were beers & were heavy. He’s like ok I don’t think he understood or cared what I was saying. Lol I come back & grab the coffee & I go to the customer.

Tell me why when I show up & have everything displayed on my wagon including the drink the guy is like oh we didn’t order coffee. -.- WTF so I guess I stole someone’s pickup order on accident & it’s all because these 711 guys never seem to know how to communicate?

He’s like you can take the coffee & I insisted he just take it but after that I wanted to retract that statement cus I definitely could’ve used a coffee right then. It was a looong day for me & I was tired. He was ok I’ll see if my wife wants it. 😭

While I’m glad I made his day probably with the free coffee it like actually made me hate the people who order UberEats more like his selfish ass couldn’t at least offer me to take the free food?! He only tipped $5 & that would barely cover a coffee. Like bruh if you couldn’t even tip all that much at least let me take the free food. 🤣

Idk just wanted to share thought it was funny & I don’t know I just regret offering the free food to the guy I should’ve taken it I’m just too nice & honestly I wanted a good rating lmao",0,1767853073.0,UberEatsDrivers,0,0.5,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

**MY YEARS IN FLUX** by Mira Hoffman, Published by Moon River Publisher, Collection: Heroes of Our Times, Date: c. 211X

So, we were stuck. Marooned on Mars with zero way back to the *Lucky Luke* and no line to Earth. The ship probably got a distress signal out before the crash, but right now, we were basically ghosts to the rest of the world.

Captain Nadia Rhodes wasn't interested in a pity party—not while we were burning through precious oxygen. Our mission commander is basically made of titanium and coffee, and she doesn't do ""giving up.""

“Listen up,” she snapped, her voice echoing in my helmet. “Everyone’s alive, which is a start. Now, we inventory the wreckage. Kazumi, Kai—go through the storage and tell me what isn't junk. Mira, Silas—you’re with me. We need a roof over our heads before the sun drops.”

Just like that, I was part of the team. My official job title on the manifest was ""Content & Documentation Specialist""—meaning I was the fluxer meant to stream our triumphs to a billion followers back home. But with the comms array smashed into a million pieces, there was no one to ""flux"" to. My new job? Muscle. Basically, I was just a grunt.

We found the microfiber package labeled “Main Quarters” and thankfully it was intact and on top. Dr. Silas Varma, our lead scientist, and I found a nice flat place to put it. Silas usually spends his time looking at microbes under a microscope, but he was surprisingly handy with a cargo winch.

Behind us, Kazumi and Kai were already tearing into the storage containers like their lives depended on it—which, honestly, they did. Our chief engineer and our ace pilot were knee-deep in crates, scanning barcodes and checking seals to see what actually survived the impact.

""Keep moving, Mira,"" Silas muttered, wiping red dust off his visor. ""The temperature's going to dive in two hours, and I'd rather not be a popsicle when the fans back home finally see your footage.""

I checked my wrist-cam. The ""Offline"" light was a depressing shade of red, but I kept the record button pinned anyway. If we were going down, I was going to make sure someone, someday, saw how hard we fought back.

Nadia hauled a heavy-duty sled over to us, loaded down with a compressor and a couple of high-pressure air tanks. We spent the next thirty minutes on our hands and knees, obsessively checking every seal and inch of the microfiber skin for tears. If there was even one pinhole, this whole thing was just a really expensive body bag. Once we were sure it wasn't a death trap, we signaled Kazumi and Kai to drop the inventory and join us. It was time for the main event: the inflation and the external bracing.

The compressor kicked in with a low, vibrating hum that felt like a heartbeat. Watching that microfiber skin bloat and stretch was like watching a ghost come to life. While the habitat took shape, I was hauling the solar arrays—twenty sleek, heavy slabs of silicon that were our only ticket to a warm night. Kazumi was already wrestling with the exterior interface, her fingers flying as she slotted in the battery blocks. They were green-lit and fully juiced, enough to keep us going for a week as long as we didn't get greedy with the heaters.

Kai jumped in to help me pivot the panels one by one. We aligned them dead-north, making sure the micro-motors were primed to hunt the sun the second it cleared the horizon. We even double-checked the night-shrouds—the automatic silver covers that snap shut to protect the glass from the freezing cold or the sandpaper effect of a Martian dust storm. If those failed, we’d be sitting in a dark, silent tent by Tuesday.

While we were playing tetris with the solar slabs, Nadia and Silas were wrestling the airlock into position. This thing was a serious piece of tech—super advanced, zero-leak, and built like a vault—but it was a total bottleneck. It could only cycle two people at a time, and the ""empty"" cycle was a grueling twenty-minute wait while the pumps fought the Martian vacuum. The refill? That was the easy part—ten seconds of a massive *whoosh* and you’re inside. It’s basically the world's most high-stakes elevator, and right now, it was our only way into the one place on this planet that wasn't trying to kill us.

Stepping inside was the first time I'd felt my heart rate drop since the crash. It wasn't just a plastic bubble; the interior walls were lined with a soft, warm-toned fabric that made the place feel less like a lab and more like a home. We spent the rest of the day in a blur of motion, clicking the five living alcoves into place and getting the micro-kitchen online. By sunset, we even had the communal space set up with the monitors and the local server. It was loaded with enough entertainment vids to last us a decade, which felt like a weirdly grim insurance policy.

Nadia stood in the center of the communal area, her helmet finally off. She looked like she’d aged five years in five hours, but she managed a tired smile.

“Good work, everyone,” she said, her voice sounding small without the suit’s speakers. “Congratulations on a job well done. Now, let's get some warm food in us and survive our first night on Mars. Tomorrow, we start the real work.”

I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep with the excitement and all that, but ""tomorrow"" came in an instant. That’s what hard work does to you—it skips the loading screen.

Breakfast was fast, and then we hit the briefing. ""First priority is long-term survival,"" Nadia said, pacing the small communal space. ""What did we lose in the crash?""

“The good news? The shock absorbers and the landing rockets saved the shuttle's shell, so we've got the hardware,"" Kai said, leaning against a storage crate. ""The bad news? The engines are toast, and the high-gain comm unit was turned into a pancake.""

""Then we focus on the basics,"" Nadia decided. ""Food, water, oxygen. Once we're stable, we figure out how to phone home. Maybe they'll send a rescue op, maybe they won't, but we aren't waiting around to find out.""

Easier said than done. It took five years to build the *Lucky Luke*, and I knew for a fact there wasn't a backup ship even on the drawing board.

“I suggest we build a small temple to *'The True Path of the Void Hermit,'*” I joked, flashing a grin. Everyone actually laughed. Even in the middle of a disaster, everyone knew about the Hermit’s supposed miracles—though the Hermit himself probably wouldn't care if we were stranded on Pluto, let alone Mars.

The next few weeks were a blur of ""real work."" We scouted ice patches, hooked up the refineries for water and oxygen, and I got stuck with the most glamorous job of all: the insect farm. Turns out, my followers back home would've loved the ""Protein Queen"" content, but here, it was just me and a lot of crickets. Kai and I spent our extra hours on the vegetable plots, trying to grow enough greens to keep us—and the bugs—alive. I kept fluxing the whole thing, recording silly interviews with the crew to keep our spirits up.

Then the ""Routine"" hit. And on Mars, routine is just another word for ""trying not to lose your mind."" To keep the space-madness at bay, Nadia had us spend our evenings brainstorming the ultimate comeback story—how to actually talk to Earth again. Silas was the one who finally cracked the code.

""Look, we went full high-tech, and look where that got us,"" Silas said during one of our nightly huddles, giving us a tired smile. ""The digital array is fried. You can't repair a shattered quantum processor with a multi-tool. So, we’re going analog. Short range.""

“How does short range help?” Kai asked, skeptical. “The ship’s brain is fully digital.”

“The comm array is, yeah. But the scientific suite? That’s a different story,” Silas explained. “The ship is in auto-orbit, snapping high-res pics of the surface to see if anything changes.”

“We’re the change!” I interrupted, getting that old fluxer spark back.

“Exactly. It’ll detect the camp and beam the images back eventually. But it’s also listening for radio noise on every frequency. So, we build the most archaic radio device possible and send pulses. Three shorts, three longs, three shorts. Morse code. SOS. If that doesn't get the AI’s attention, I’m officially retiring to a crater.”

So, we all became ""Analog Ops"" specialists overnight. My job? Building the ""Antenna-Foil Monster."" I spent days crafting a massive three-meter antenna out of scrap metal and literal kitchen foil. It was a total monstrosity—looked like a giant's DIY science project gone wrong—and the emitter we hooked up to it was a frankenstein-beast of old wires and stone-age tech.

But when we finally flipped the switch, it felt like we were throwing a flare into the dark. We started sending our first message of hope into the stars, praying someone, or something, was listening.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

Who is the biggest exporter of agricultural products in the world?

The answer depends on how agricultural exports are measured, but when it comes to the total value of exported agricultural goods, the United States is generally considered the largest exporter. The country exports a wide range of products including corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, meat, and dairy. Large scale farming, advanced technology, and strong logistics networks allow the United States to supply food to many regions around the world.

Other countries also play very important roles in global agricultural exports. Brazil is a major exporter of soybeans, coffee, sugar, and beef and has seen rapid growth over the past few decades. The European Union, when viewed as a single group, exports a high value of processed foods, dairy products, and grains. India is known for exporting rice, spices, cotton, and tea, while China focuses more on domestic consumption despite being one of the largest producers of agricultural goods.

Overall, the[ biggest agricultural exporter](https://vertezsteelglobalworksllp.com/category/agriculture) depends on whether the focus is on total export value, specific crops, or regional influence. Each major exporting country contributes in its own way to feeding the global population.

I would be interested to hear how others define agricultural leadership and which countries they think have the biggest impact on global food trade.",1,1767852497.0,u_arunsharma124,0,1.0,False

Hope you are well

I wanted to share my story today,

Last month i went to do a training course for my work in a different city which was around 3 hours away via train for one day,

I asked my husband if he could drive me there or if he could come with me and he refused saying its too far and that he dosnt want to put to many miles on his performance car so i said its okay he was okay with me going alone to, bare in mind we share locations with each other too

So now im on my way, and he says that he wants to go to my hometown to go to a food-place we both like but the drive was too long i.e around 45 mins and we did speak a few days prior where he suggested staying in a hotel himself whilst i was gone because he had some work to do as majority of his work is online and because we live with our in laws it would be easier for him to and that i could join him later there and we could come back together,

So on the day he looked at bookings for the hotel and it was available in my hometown but he was in two different minds and wasnt sure if he wanted to go he then decided half an hour later yep im going to go but the rooms were all sold out

He then checked for the same hotel in his hometown a bit after and it was available he was again contemplating as he said he only wanted to stay in the other hotel due to that food place in that city and that this hotel was near his home and dint have the food place near that he wanted so it was pointless , then an hour later he said he's gonna book it because its cheap anyways and that hed get to sleep in a better bed so i said okay because our bed wasn't the bed at home,

He then goes to this hotel we get to our hotels round about the same time, he factimes me calls me we were speaking majority of the time he even send me a screenshot of him watching a boxing fight and said this is what im doing, when it got to around 12am he told me to go to sleep because i have something important tomorrow morning and would need to wake up early, and he kept insisting that i should go to sleep and that it was irritating him that i was awake the one time i should be asleep because i have something to wake up for early and my focus wont be the same, i agreed and tried to sleep but i couldnt.

He then texts me at 2am saying my mum just called and she asked where i was and i told her im in a hotel because the bed at home hurts my back and i asked him why are you still awake? And he says i was about to fall asleep but my mum called me and told me why i was awake i said i woke up to the sound of his msgs as my ringer was on and he said my bad go back to sleep to which i then fell asleep.

The next day i do my training and come back around 8-9pm he picks me up from the train station and says hes hungry and hasnt eaten all day to which we agreed to go get some tacos, when we got to the tacos place it was closed so then we decided to go elsewhere to our usual food spot which was about 30 minutes away, we were speaking as usual in the car and about 10-12 minutes in to the drive a Message pops up from an unknown number on WhatsApp on the car play screen as his phone was connected to car play his phone was in the cupholder so i grabbed it and opened it and it was a woman i asked who is this to him and he said idk i waited for the woman to finish typing first she said hey then she said ""im available tonight for £150 per hour if interested"" and there was no previous messages from the chat and the number was not saved but there was a profile picture of a white middle aged woman, my heart sank , i asked him again and he said idk who this is ask them, i instantly took a picture of the messages from his phone on my phone and i rang her and i said who is this at first she said i think wrong number she hesitated and i said tell me the truth why are you messaging my husband and where did you get his content from and she said he messaged me yesterday night and explained her line of work she said i didn't know he was married, i hung up and he tried saying i dont know her are u seriously going to believe her , i never texted her xyz i then texted her asking for the previous chats as there was none of his phone , she sent the messages and it had his number on the top, and it was him reaching out to her first however the message's were all deleted from his end but hers were showing from then screenshots.

I then asked him to take me to my parents home and that i didnt want to be with him anymore, i felt so betrayed, he was persistent on still going to eat i said im not going anywhere we then drove back home and he went to a different road to try and speak to me, and i asked him to be honest for once and bc shed at this point sent the screenshots to me i said this is ur number you texted her, he admitted to it and said he also texted 2 others, when i asked him where he found her from he said it dosnt matter etc and then after asking multiple times said it was a pop up from the boxing match on an illegal site, hes watched from this site before infront of me and been super quick to x ads, he was begging me to not leave him etc and that it was a mistake , i kept asking if he had done anything with this or the other woman and he said no i was literally in bed thinking i have a wife at home and she does everything for me even if i want something sexually she will fulfil it and he said he never acted on it bc he felt very guilty, i didnt believe him bc he has always lied until ive shown him physical proof to his face, in this case the screenshots from the woman, he even said ill request footage from the hotel and you can see im not lying, i didn't want to speak to him as i felt disgusted

So we went home and i asked him not to sleep next to me or to come to our room so he had to sleep the entire night downstairs on the sofa, i msged the woman again and asked her what site shes on and she told me the site it was a prostitution site, i confronted him saying shes from xyz site does this even come up on boxing ads usually the ads on boxing sites are fake and he said yes wallahi it is etc ,

The next morning i packed all my things and left for my parents home, he kept begging and pleading to not do this and to not leave him, in the end he knew i was going one way or another, so he asked me not to take all my things and only some because his family would see, so i respected that even though i did not have to and only took half of my things, i never told his family either because there has been a history of his family/mother supporting him of his wrongdoings so i just did not bother as they would again side with him

He continued begging and begging even after dropping me with multiple text msgs etc, calls spamming asking me to go eat with him i refused to see him and he came by the next day again outside my house because i wasn't answering him and waited around 4-5 hours and in the end got fed up and just left my remaining things outside my house,

The following days he continued to beg he then came again and i saw him and he even said ill touch the quran and say i didnt sleep with anyone to which i made him, and if he was speaking to other women behind my back or ever has during the entirety of our marriage, he said no to all my questions and confessed to some , the woman also said she did not see him that night because she ended up being busy and that he wanted the booking late around 2am and then didn't confirm, but i Don't know if he saw any of the two others or any of their contacts, he says he didnt and swore on quran, the hotel refused to give the footage due to privacy reasons and would and said they would only give it to the police if something had gone missing etc by filing a report with them first. 

I had caught him before adding girls on his phone, searching up certain girls, and when id add those girls theyd say he added then first etc, to which he did this happened 3-4 times, and hed say it wont happen again hed get really angry for me going on his phone and say this is an invasion of my privacy etc, one day i even caught something and he woke up from his sleep and questioned why i was on his phone and i refused to give him the phone which led to a fight and in turn him hitting me, this was told to his family and he told his mum i didnt hit her when he did as i had scatch marks on my neck and blood coming from it and in turn his mum agreed and said to my family he didn't hit her, and then he started begging and crying to my mum privately that it wont happen ever again and that he's sorry so she told me to forgive him.

He also says things like if i had something to hide why would  u know my phone passcode then, and that u can go through my phone during the day why the night but if id ask him during the day he'd get so mad and say things like are you serious or are u fr.

All the women ive caught on his phone look nothing like me im asian and theyre all white women so i asked him if he was into white women, i said why is it always white women and he said no im not into white women if that was the case why would i marry an asian , no offence but my type has always been asian but it makes no sense at all to me.

I dont work, i cook clean and cater to him 24/7 from coffee in bed as soon as he wakes up to fully cooked meals throughout the day whilst, i even cook for his siblings , there is nothing that i dont do for him and when i mentioned that im always catering to him etc he says any woman will do that and says what do u even do im the one who works hard, what i do for him is seen as nothing. He mostly works from his phone as its all online based so i feel crazy for questioning him or thinking what is going on in that phone because he literally works from home , i only recently went to do work training to get into my field of work and he even ruined that for me.

We have only been married for a year and a half and im still quite young im 20 and hes a few years older than me we had a love marriage i knew him around 6-7 months prior to marriage, i dont come from a rich family or a rich background and neither does he but he became very wealthy in the last couple of years. Im always told he does xyz for me and that no other man would do that for me and the luxury i have in my life at such a young age i should be grateful , he had even called my family horrible names

A few months ago i was pregnant and i ended up having a early miscarriage, and when i got pregnant he felt as if we weren't ready to have a child, we had an argument during that time in which he gave me 1 talaq and made me leave his house whilst being pregnant, we reconciled in that time and he was very supportive to me during the miscarriage

This time round when he was asking me to forgive him i asked him for a civil marriage in turn and he refused he said i will never do a civil marriage i do not believe in it and refused and said im making our marriage about money now, but i sacraficed my education, me working my career to stay at home and cater to him 24/7 for him to do that, so then i said leave it because no amount of monetary value can make a man that doesn't want to be loyal to u be loyal to you.

I just dont know what to do anymore im so scared to let go because im completely dependent of him.

he begged me for days on end and promised to change and that i wont regret it and make a whole load of promises, i even went to the imam that did our Nikkah and explained what he did and the imam advised me to give him another chance as he was saying it wont happen again and that it was a mistake  and we are speaking again and already we've fought a few times but if i bring up what he done he doesn't want to go in circles and doesn't want to talk about it anymore but i just discovered the specific profile of the woman he messaged you have to verify ur age using ur id, so im thinking did he rlly do all that to see this woman's pictures , im so baffled.

Fitness isn’t just about hitting the gym. It’s also about being conscious of what we eat. And in this economy, we know how food can be so expensive. Fastfood are everyone, but consuming fastfood doesn’t automatically equate to being unhealthy.

QC has already implemented requiring restaurants to include the calorie count in their menus. Since it isn’t implemented yet in the entire country, let’s share this initiative to everyone who wants to eat fastfood (whether as a cheat meal, reward to self or what not) while still being mindful of what we eat.

I prefer low-fat foods but over the years I was artificially making myself eat meats and fats to eat “high protein/low carb.”. After 2 decades of successfully implementing keto/Paleo/Atkins variants, which kept me skinny, I eventually gained it all back and then some once I hit menopause. I could no longer maintain high protein eating with the requisite carb cutting. So I eventually developed a diet that’s the worst of both worlds – high carb and high fat - and packed on the pounds.

Not sure if I’ve ever had a gallstone attack. I would sometimes get long lasting tight-band-around-and-just-under-the-rib-cage pains, but am not sure if this is an attack or not (would often get this on flights.) I’m otherwise asymptomatic, though severely fatigued.

I was wondering if a strange symptom of mine is related: I developed a STRONG aversion to water.

[Personalized drink coasters](https://sweetumssignatures.com/engravings/kitchen-bar/coasters/) are one of the most thoughtful and versatile gifts you can give today. They combine beauty and practicality in a way that turns an everyday object into a memorable keepsake. Whether celebrating a milestone, welcoming someone to a new home, or simply showing appreciation, customized coasters make a lasting impression.

# What Makes Personalized Drink Coasters Special

Unlike ordinary coasters, personalized drink coasters reflect a personal touch. You can customize them with names, initials, meaningful dates, or special sayings. This personal element transforms a simple item into something uniquely suited to the recipient.

Beyond aesthetics, personalization creates emotional value. A set of coasters designed with care becomes more than functional. It becomes a cherished part of someone’s daily routine. Whether displayed on a coffee table or used at a gathering, custom coasters convey thoughtfulness and intention that standard gifts often lack.

# Perfect for Every Occasion

One of the biggest advantages of personalized drink coasters is their versatility. They fit seamlessly into a wide range of gifting scenarios:

* Birthdays and anniversaries where a personal touch adds meaning
* Housewarming gifts that help new spaces feel welcoming
* Weddings and bridal showers as elegant and useful keepsakes
* Corporate events and professional gifting with customized designs
* Holiday gifting for friends, family, or colleagues

Because of this flexibility, personalized coasters remain a reliable choice when you want something both meaningful and practical.

# Practical and Stylish for Everyday Use

Many gifts are admired and then stored away, but personalized drink coasters serve a real purpose every day. They protect tables and countertops from water rings, spills, and heat marks, making them ideal for kitchens, living rooms, home bars, and offices.

Modern coaster designs allow function and style to work together. With clean finishes and thoughtful customization, these coasters complement a variety of interior styles while remaining easy to use and maintain.

# Materials and Design Options to Match Every Taste

Personalized drink coasters are available in a variety of materials, each offering a distinct look and feel:

* Wood for a warm and timeless appearance
* Cork for lightweight protection and casual style
* Ceramic for an elegant and polished finish
* Slate or stone for a premium and handcrafted look
* Acrylic or glass for a modern and sleek aesthetic

Designs can range from simple monograms to detailed engravings that reflect hobbies, interests, or shared memories. This variety ensures there is an option to suit every taste and setting.

# A Thoughtful Gift That Is Budget Friendly

Personalized drink coasters offer excellent value. They are typically more affordable than many customized gift items while still delivering strong visual and emotional impact. Whether purchased as a single set or in bulk, they provide quality and meaning without exceeding budget expectations.

This balance makes them an ideal choice for personal gifting as well as larger events or celebrations.

# Final Thoughts: A Gift That Feels Personal and Useful

Personalized drink coasters stand out because they blend everyday usefulness with personal expression. They protect surfaces while adding character to a space and meaning to a moment.

Whether given to a friend, family member, colleague, or loved one, customized coasters offer a lasting reminder of thoughtfulness. This combination of function and sentiment makes them a perfect gift for nearly any occasion.",1,1767851931.0,u_Sweetums_Signature,0,1.0,False

I can’t seem to meet anybody my age anywhere near where I live. I don’t mind a long drive and have done them many times for friends in the past, but it makes just dropping in or running an errand together impossible.

A lot of women my age are now starting to have kids, and in my experience this makes it very difficult for us to relate to each other.

In the past, I’ve been frustrated feeling like my “friendships” are us sitting somewhere telling each other about each other’s lives rather than being a part of them. Furthermore, even in my past close friendships with women, there seems to be a common thread of them wanting to tell me a lot about people in their lives I don’t know and will never meet. In the past, I’ve made an effort to remember about these people and ask about them (literally past friends have been surprised and pleased that I remember their friends and acquaintances so well and remarked about it), even though deep down it’s hard to care because I will never meet these people and I would rather be building a relationship of my own with this person. 

But going to someone else’s house is rare these days. Dropping in or going to do something fun on a whim cuz why not is rare these days. 

The other thing is, paradoxically, I usually end up feeling like the other person wants too much of me (this is where I feel Gen Z). I have a range of issues that make it a challenge to just meet my own needs at times, and from time to time I need a few hours or even days where I’m not responsive on my phone. This has been a HUGE issue with most past and present friends. As I’ve gotten better at responding, it seems the complaints have only increased as it almost seems to set a higher expectation and it feels I’m not allowed a break without announcing it ahead of time as if requesting PTO at work. 

I really want to see people in-person, preferably for low-stakes interactions that involve us doing stuff together. But instead, I feel I end up in the friendship version of a situationship where I get roped into an ongoing asynchronous endless conversation but any actual meetup is A Thing and tends to be very formal and rare. 

I live in a bustling metro area but everyone is much older, and even in this area, I have gone to meetups specifically looking for activity-minded people who like interacting with others in-person and everyone without exception somehow lives an hour away. Oh and is also a lot older than I am. 

Sorry for the tired rambling. I am just wondering if these weird “friendships” are a smartphone thing where people think texting is the main part of a friendship, or if all people under 40 tend to live in big cities, or if it’s just me having “boundaries” and I have to basically text as a part-time job if I want to graduate to an in-person friendship. Or maybe as I am approaching 30, most women my age are being subsumed by caretaking and don’t have time for someone to say “let’s grab coffee and wander around Target for an hour”? 

I have this idealistic picture in my mind of what life was like before smart phones where you weren’t constantly burned out from the endless demands that come with them, and instead spent that energy stopping by a neighbor’s house or trying to learn to skip rocks for a couple hours at the pond. I feel like relationships now are just infodumps, either on the phone via text or in-person because no one knows how to be together anymore. I often feel jealous that men generally seem to be more involved and in-person in their friendships (even gaming together on a phone call is something), but I am not looking for male friends at the moment. 

So what were friendships like before smart phones? Did the same problems manifest in different ways? Or is my rosy picture close to the truth?",3,1767851858.0,AskWomenOver40,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

my best friend of nearly a decade is becoming a cop this year. he has been in the military for the past few years, and uprooted his and his wife's life several times already with deployments. due to his transition and the recent crackdown from US administration, he's being forced out of the army and back into a civilian role, and has chosen (and been hired) to become an LEO.

I was already struggling with accepting his choice to join the military - I don't believe in supporting the war machine, I think it breeds violence, obedience and a misplaced devotion to American patriotism, but becoming a cop seems even worse somehow, especially now. 

I've asked several times and tried to reconcile his answers with my own values, and just can't seem to do it. he wants to ""help people"". that's really it. he can't seem to provide any other context, reasoning or motivation.

my take is, there are 1000 other jobs that actually help people without the safety risk, corruption, violence, betrayal to the community, etc. firefighters? social workers? engineers? park rangers? therapists, doctors, house cleaners, tutors, teachers, veterinarians, dentists???  ANYTHING else? I personally think someone who makes a good cup of coffee is doing more community service than a cop, but obviously I have a huge bias here. literally we both have bachelor's degrees and he is perfectly capable of learning, functioning, and succeeding in multiple types of working environments (his work history includes customer service/food service, corporate, medical/labs, and obviously physical labor/military).

I don't want to end a friendship over this - I value this person and do not like to think he would ever make bad choices to intentionally hurt anyone. but the fact is, he has already done some unspeakable things during his time in the military, because it was his ""job"" and he'd be fired or court marshalled if he hadn't. I just don't understand how you could obey awful orders like that and then turn around and do it again, willingly, for no reason. to me, that says something about you, and it's not something good.

in terms of our friendship, it's no surprise we are quite distanced now, both physically and emotionally. he has basically withdrawn from our friend group chat and responds maybe once or twice every few months, never provides any life updates, never asks anyone how they're doing, unless I specifically call him out in a direct message for ghosting everyone. then he will ""try"" for a few days by sending memes to the chat and go back to being invisible. when we do end up chatting, all he really talks about is the military, his command, his shifts, his work, his fellow soldiers, etc. I feel like he's just utterly brainwashed by this lifestyle and I don't even know who he is anymore. so maybe this is all a moot point and the friendship is already dead. 

I'm really at a loss here. I will probably end up going to therapy to talk this through before making any decisions or even breaching the topic with him again, but given that the relationship between the queer community and law enforcement has always been strained, I wanted to hear from more folks first and get a sanity check. would you draw a line here? what context would help you to make a decision like this? am I missing any critical questions I should be asking?

That’s when I discovered Studienkolleg at Technische Hochschule Köln—basically a prep school for international students who want to study at a German university. Think of it as a language bootcamp + mini university crash course. You’re learning your subjects in German, leveling up your grammar, and pretending you know what “Wirtschaft” actually means.

There are different tracks depending on what you want to study:

* T – tech & engineering
* M – medicine & life sciences
* W – economics, business, social sciences (that’s me!)
* G – arts & humanities

I joined the W course and immediately realized two things: 1) My German was… basic. 2) Everyone else’s German was sometimes worse than mine, but in a fun, relatable way. Studying with students from all over the world made it amazing. We laughed at our mistakes, swapped stories about our home countries, and sometimes our classes turned into mini cultural exchange sessions.

The focus was really on language. Every day we were reading, writing, presenting, and basically living in German. Sometimes I’d leave class exhausted but also feeling like a little German ninja—finally understanding all those tricky cases and articles!

A fun side story: I needed a Verpflichtungserklärung (basically a sponsor to prove I could afford living in Germany) to get a student visa. Finding someone willing to do it was a bit of a quest. It involved emails, awkward questions, and a lot of “please, just sign this for me!” But once I got it, everything clicked, and I was officially on my way to university.

Outside class, life was just as fun. Coffee breaks turned into mini language lessons. Lunches turned into trying foods from everywhere, one day we were sharing Kenyan snacks, the next someone brought German pretzels and sausages. I even joined a few student clubs, and honestly, meeting people from all over the globe made every awkward German mistake worth it.

By the end of Studienkolleg, my German had improved massively, I had friends all over the world, and I felt confident stepping into university life. It was chaotic, challenging, exhausting, but also one of the most fun, rewarding experiences of my life.

Ristretto drinker at my local cafe; Bialetti Venus “espresso” shots at home; 1-3 shots per day; buy my beans from a local roaster; fond of manual processes / sensitive to high pitched electrical machines; want to appreciate the coffee products I’m buying on a deeper level.

1q73s4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/recoverywithoutAA/comments/1q73s4c/an_unexpected_journey_leading_to_the_exit/,An unexpected journey leading to the exit.,"Being shunned is really rough. I was in an unbelievable mental hell after being dropped by the person i was dating. A few weeks later relieved of my position with a severance package. I was “let go”  NOT because a person started a rumor that I relapsed in retaliation for not being chosen as my assistant. No it was what I said in that conversation. A bit broken hearted my employee did this I confided in my boss and his right hand man that I was thinking of being a flight attendant. I wanted to go on the vacation planned a week from than and clear my head, I know I am not well and I am trying everything. In their eyes after getting me a therapist a few weeks prior I was not okay and needed time. Of course my mistake was seeing them as friends, fellow sober people, in hind site they got the therapist so they could not worry about me possibly not showing up. The Monday following I was let go. I followed my programming Be honest, the truth will set you free. Bosses are NEVER friends. Business is business.
 (Warning!! if you do “business”  with someone in AA … I.e they offer you a job or they regularly refer to the Big Book or literature. Watch your ass and don’t mistake that business is and always will be business… the program quickly takes a back seat. A lot of faith was lost in my many transactions) 

So I was left with no work, money, a totally broken heart, and I clung onto the things I had used for years but they were not working. I did yoga in the am, worked out in the pm, went to meetings, attended anything I could with the groups. I was fucking miserable. I was getting chastised for it. Pray, you need a 4th step, go to a meeting. My insides were screaming WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM DOING. I felt so lost, betrayed, broken, I did not want to live. 

Then the most random thought came, go to the woods, eat mushrooms. It became a strong thought, I almost felt relief just thinking it. I hadn’t done those since I was 15 and I was 34 at the time. I if course did what my program thought and ran it by the sponsor and trusted confidants. The feedback was mixed. I was on a trip with many sober men skiing the week after my layoff. I was of still miserable and just wanted my body to feel normal, my anxiety and racing thoughts to stop. The jerks who like to chime in “your ruminating” “you are obsessed” “let go let god” “do another 4th step” I couldn’t stop it, it felt like the only possibility was an “accident” with no note. 

The moment we got back to our town, I found out my buddy was not going camping with me in the desert anymore. It felt like the universe was leading me. I took my journey, my first solo road trip, first psychedelic experience in 15 years. My first mind altering anything in 6.5 years. For the sake of getting to a point. It opened my eyes. I felt like 20years of therapy was completed during the very terrifying dangerous hike up the mountain on a hefty dose of mushroom. About half way up I took a hefty dose that hit very very fast. I could not see well with all the visuals and disoriention. I had to look for foot prints on the ground to follow. No one was around at all. Nothing but desert, a large mountain and me. This voice woke up. Clearer than I have ever heard my inner voice up to that point I was told “YOU HAVE DONE THIS ENTIRE LIFE ALONE, FROM DAY ONE YOU MANAGED TO MAKE IT DAY BY DAY. YOU CAME FOR THIS AND YOU WILL GO TO THE TOP” I made it indeed, just a few hours later. What happened at the top still makes me tear up. That’s another story all together. So back to the subject at hand… leaving the program.

I made a huge mistake when I returned. I went straight to a meeting. One of the more open minded groups. I was met with open arms and comments of “wow you seem so lite what are you doing” “your energy is totally different in a good way… love you” 

With the positive reinforcement and  programming I felt extremely positive about my experience and knew I was not to talk about it in meetings, but I shared with my friends. My dumb ass felt like I stumbled on the ultimate secret and I wanted to share it. I saw my friends struggling and hurting and I had this magnificent new outlook. Of course share with the people you love. BIG BIG MISTAKE.

I continued to use psychedelics well mushrooms, micro dosing. I was met after a meeting with a really strong sense I was being glared at. I was, a mutual friend of my best friend/littermate/first friend at that AA group. Completely chewed me out. The perception was I was recruiting people. The chewing was my short sided statement after my friend said “I’m glad you had such a great experience I can’t do that due to my probation” my response “that does not even matter” my statement was not received like I meant. I had this huge Birds Eye view and was talking to a very grounded group. 

That was the first time I had ever experienced a negative interaction in 6.5 years. It reallly threw me. I addressed my friend directly without the middle man and found I was being seen as Relapsed. ( I was in the context of abstinence , I couldn’t comprehend how feeling like I did before was better than taking a fungus that has been around for a million years)  

Things turned pretty quick. I started to clam up. I didn’t want to go back to anxiety and constant anguish and pain. Yet I was delusional in thinking I was cured. After being shunned it returned and I started to question not only my past relationship and job, my fundamental group was now not processing correctly in my mind. I kept going out of habit but could not sit through an entire meeting. I started to catch things I had been totally blind to before. I guess because I was spending time there but not as engaged I was hearing more as well. It was not a healthy place. The underbelly was very very sick… and so was I. 

It got to the point that I walked away. I joined a psychedelics in recovery group. Since my entire belief system was upheaved, I could not trust any of my beliefs about people or my judgments on life. I linked up with one person from the new group and went down the rabbit hole allll the way. I found alcohol is something I only tolerate in small doses I do not like anything that starts to make me tired or buzzed. Pot gave me anxiety, I only discovered this after a few weeks of initial bliss and enjoyment. It was like linking up with an old school friend. I did try other substances. Mind you all of this was under the guise of spiritual awakening. Prayers and ceremonies 2-3 times a week. The hard drugs were outside of that group but I was able to go to the group and talk about the experience without being judged. I was able to process it without shame which helped me realize I don’t like loss of control. But I still had the anxiety and would get stuck in my house for weeks. When needing to make money it was not productive. I made a few big doozie decisions and destroyed what little respect I had in the community. I realized that the psychedelic meeting was a great place to talk about these things… BECAUSE there was not judgement, question or feedback other than. “That’s beautiful” 

I was a person that was totally conditioned to groups and passing all decisions through others. To a group that consigned alll of my decisions… to realizing it was time to step away from them as well. I still kept in contact with a few. Just got away form the meetings

Than BOOM near death experience diverticulitis ruptured my intestine and made me septic so I was given an ostomy bag. I failed to mention only three years before had I gotten a body I was comfortable with. Well more than comfortable I barely wore clothes, loved the nude beach and went for walks in a jock strap. No shame just happy and free on the outside covering a shitshow inside


almost from the beginning of my departure I received several text, voicemails, calls telling me I am fucking up, get my ass back to meetings, stopped at the grocery store and told was going to die. Not a single time was I asked how I was doing, offered to hang out or grab coffee like humans do. I was so lonely I tried to go to a few meetings and was met with sympathy and open arms. Also offered a fund raiser party and how I was going to be visited blah blah blah. Nothing happened. No one visited from the AA program. However my pot smoking hippie friends that actually lived a little closer to the ground were there without question and I am so grateful for that.

That is the bulk of my adventure. I am now about 3 years out. I have a totally different career. I am using my energy to learn, get certifications, started my own business.
My ex came back, we got back together. Thought if he hadn’t changed it would be easier the second time around. I was so so very wrong. I had taken some pain meds for my back so I could work( it’s only me supporting me) that had my mind going to the way deadlier options. I immediately got with a psychiatrist and therapist got on some meds. With full intention of using them as a crutch until I could get on my feet the bag taken off and the heartbreak to a manageable spot. 

Guess what… I am at that point to let go of the crutches with the acceptance if i start to tank or return to that state of mind I am okay with staying on them and just staying at the mimum. I pay attention to my body, work out and eat healthy. But if I want ice cream I eat it. 
I call my parents pretty regular and check in. I hang at home and brain storm projects than execute. I hang with a few people and always open to an adventure. I love my life today

When I was 16, there was this one night where I couldn’t sleep at all. My head was pounding, not like a migraine but that dull pressure that won’t let your brain shut up. I figured I’d just step outside and walk it off. I live in Atlanta, and there’s a small park not too far from my place with a bunch of tall trees. Nothing sketchy, just quiet.

It was past 1 AM. Streets empty. No cars, no people, no noise except the wind and my footsteps.

At first, everything felt normal. I was walking, trying to clear my head, when I suddenly stopped because I thought I smelled something… off. I couldn’t even place it at first. I shrugged it off and kept walking, but the feeling didn’t leave. The smell came back stronger. It was this weird mix of something foul and something oddly familiar, like boiling potatoes. And that made zero sense. Who the hell is boiling potatoes at 1 in the morning with no houses around?

The deeper I walked, the quieter everything got. No lights ahead, just trees lining the road. My heart started pounding out of nowhere. I wasn’t scared consciously. I wasn’t thinking about anything threatening. But my body absolutely disagreed. My chest was tight, heartbeat going crazy, like my instincts were yelling while my brain was trying to play it cool.

Then that inner voice hit me hard. Not a thought, not imagination. Just this overwhelming feeling screaming: RUN. TURN BACK. SOMETHING IS WRONG.

I didn’t even argue with it. I turned around immediately and sped up, almost power-walking back the way I came. The smell followed for a bit, then faded. I didn’t stop until I was far from that area. I didn’t look back once.

After that night, I heard people say that experiences like this don’t always do something right away, but they mess with your head later. Nightmares, paranoia, stuff you can’t explain.

That part ended up being true.

I started having these dreams that felt way too real. In one of them, I walked into a grocery store and bought snacks like it was a normal day. The store was almost empty, just me and a few strangers. Two men and a woman. They were friendly. Smiling. Too friendly. Even in the dream, I felt uneasy, like I was being watched but couldn’t tell by who.

After that, I got into my car and drove off. A few minutes later, the car broke down. I was standing outside waiting when a guy around my age came up and offered help. He seemed nice. Calm. Said he’d call for backup, and until then, we could wait at a house nearby. He pointed toward it.

That’s when I realized something weird. I hadn’t seen that house before. And it definitely wasn’t there earlier.

I didn’t feel like I had a choice, so I went with him.

Inside the house was a small family. Parents. A little girl, maybe seven. Everything felt normal on the surface. They offered coffee because it was cold. We talked. But the entire time, this dread was building up in my chest.

Then I noticed the guy.

His eyes changed. Not glowing, not dramatic. Just… wrong. Empty in a way I can’t explain. Before I could react, his neck twisted at an angle that no human neck should ever twist.

I ran.

I sprinted back outside to my car, except the car wasn’t mine. It was old. Blue. Not the black one I owned. I turned around to see if he was chasing me.

The house was gone.

No house. No lights. No people. Just empty space like it was never there to begin with.

I woke up with my heart slamming so hard it felt painful. I couldn’t move. Putting my feet on the floor felt impossible. I didn’t want to turn my backside to the room wall space. I was convinced something might will be watching me if i did so. I stayed under my blanket until sunrise, waiting for the sunlight to hit my face just so I could feel real again.

It was 1 year ago when this happened, but the memory stuck. I don’t go near that park anymore. I don’t mess with latenight walks in quiet places. Maybe it was stress. Maybe it was my brain messing with me. But whatever it was, it felt aware.

And that’s the part that still gets me....",8,1767851083.0,Paranormal,5,1.0,False

My last job was more physically active and less mentally stimulating, plus I worked for less hours. My new job is very sedentary and keeps my mind occupied most of the day, with less time at home to think about what’s in my kitchen.

1q73njk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NewNeptuneSaturn/comments/1q73njk/the_4th_eros/,The 4th Eros,"I walk into the coffee shop to pick up my usual mobile order. I’m relieved to see her at the table across the lobby closest to the window. She must enjoy it, she sits there often. Natural light *is* appealing. Especially this time of year.

Her laptop is open and she’s focused as usual. You can tell by watching her she takes her work seriously. She’s not so serious that she’s inaccessible though. Not that I’ve ever talked to her. I’ve just seen her talk to other customers and staff. She’s warm, kind and thoughtful towards them. 

I like when she’s here. *Warm, kind and thoughtful.* Something about her *feels* good.

“She’s really beautiful.” The thought crosses my mind for the thousandth time. I shake off the thought train, the last thing I need to is chase
another Eros. 

I’ve felt her watching me for months now. I know that Eros feeling. I’ve suffered through several of them the last few months. I’m tired of chasing, I’m tired of suffering, I’m tired of searching for and longing for love. 

I sigh as I stare at the counter searching for my name on one of the 12 cups sitting there waiting for pickup. I finally see mine, “Psyche” in bold letters. I grab it and turn to leave. 

“Hi.” 

I look up to see who it is. It’s *her*. I grip my hot cup tightly. 

“Hi.” I say it back, but it doesn’t sound nearly as soothing as the way she said it. I sound…casual. That’s good. Casual is a good tone. 

“Working hard?” I gesture towards her table. 

“Always.” She smiles softly when she says it. Her voice is so soothing. There’s something about it that feels…

“We should have coffee sometime.” It’s less of a question and more of general statement. I…did she give me room to say yes? Or no? How do I feel about this?

I glance at the cups in our hands. “Isn’t that what we’re doing now.” It’s less question and more observation. She raises an eyebrow and smiles. She gives a little laugh.

She takes my cup gingerly from my hand as she responds. “I mean, we should have coffee together. Intentionally. Like a date. I’d like to ask you questions and get to know you.” She grabs one of the cardboard sleeves off the condiment station and places it around my cup handing it back to me. 

“It’s safer for you to have a solid grip on a hot cup.” 

“We can get coffee.” I say it cleanly. I don’t imply anything else and I don’t really use a tone. 

If I start flirting too early I’ll lose clarity. I need to see clearly. No more chasing Eros’. No more getting lost in chemistry. I’ll give her the date, but I won’t overthink it or romanticize it. 

I like how she focuses on her laptop. I like her voice. I like how she treats the people around her. Those are likes, and I don’t need to write a story in my head that makes her perfect for me. I don’t know her. 

I don’t know her. That’s my mantra. 

I text her my phone number and then make my way out of the coffee shop back into the chill of the New Year’s weather. 

Am I really going to do this? Am I ready to try again with a New Eros? 

I think about it more thoroughly on my walk back to work. I’ve learned a lot of lessons, I found myself again, I’m more clear about what I need and what love is vs what it isn’t. I trust myself. If she’s not good for me I’m always free to leave and to choose me first. 

I don’t want to chase love. I don’t want to run away either. I’m strong enough to be here for this in a clear headed way. 

So far she’s not like the other Eros’. So far my body feels safe. One day at a time. If she builds trust great, if she doesn’t I trust me to do what I have to do to protect me. I’ll never betray or abandon myself for someone else again. 

I can give her a chance because I *trust* me. ",1,1767851028.0,u_NewNeptuneSaturn,0,1.0,False

I (25F) am getting married this year in May . I Have been engaged since summer 2024 and planned the wedding shortly after. I asked bridesmaids / maid of honours to be a part of the wedding party in Feb 2025. 

I have 5 bridesmaids, and 2 of them are co-maids of honour (my sister and let’s call the other one Barb) 
Barb and I have known each other since we were born as our families were quite close and we have siblings that are the same ages. Barb got married (eloped) in 2023 and had a baby in 2024. I knew asking Barb to be a co-maid of honour would be difficult for her newly married with a new baby and she lives in a different city than the wedding is in. I was very clear when I asked her that if she didn’t feel comfortable accepting the duties for whatever reason that I understood. For reference Barb is a little hippie -ish and raising her baby is #1 priority, she is a SAHM and doesn’t believe in daycare and has a lot of anxiety leaving baby with anyone other than her in-laws or her husband -all of which I understand and took into account when asking her. 
Barb accepted the duties happily and did an amazing job helping me organize things, kept me on track, and even planned the bachelorette with my sister with every hour scheduled and tons of activities I will enjoy. 

Fast forward to this week -4 months before wedding - Barb and I met for coffee since she was in my town and chatted a lot about the wedding and the finer details. Then, at the end of the conversation Barb lets me know she is pregnant and due 1 month before the wedding. She said she will ‘probably’ be able to still attend the wedding but would depend on how she was feeling / the health of the baby. She also mentioned they had been trying for a second child for a while and that the month they conceived was the last month they were going to try so that she could still attend the wedding (?). Her plan is for her in-laws to travel with her to where the wedding is and then they will watch the two kids while she is at the wedding and she will leave intermittently to pump/ feed baby. She also mentioned her in-laws told her she should not attend the wedding and are trying to get out of it. 
In the moment, I kind of brushed it off and tried to keep it positive but the more that I thought about it after the more hurt I was. 
I understand that they have plans for their family and  at the end of the day those kinds of decisions can be more important than a wedding, but I just felt a little slighted that there is a chance that she won’t be able to come after she accepted the position as coMOH. 
I also know that because of how she was with baby #1 (she didn’t leave the house for almost 3 months) that at first sight of anything going wrong she will not come. 
I also wish she would’ve told me sooner because I could’ve tried to coordinate and asked someone else to be a bridesmaid, but honestly I don’t really care about having uneven numbers or that stuff
I guess I just feel hurt that my wedding and being there for me isn’t important enough to her?

In the first image, the Prince is shown wielding a whip either against Zelda 1 or another civilian women who is covering her child in protection. In the image, the Magician is shown behind the Prince, but the actual shadow of the Prince leads directly into the body of the Magician as if they are connected. The limbs of the Magician are not shown in the first image, almost if they are connected 1:1 at the moment.

The manual never states why the Prince is acting violently in the image at all. Directly attacking Zelda 1, his own sibling, seems out of character even with only verbal influence from the Magician. The actions of the Prince at the time could be explained with a theory of him simply being temporarily controlled or possessed by the Magician at the time, which attempted to use his body to directly get the information from Zelda.

So I believe the events could have went like this in my headcanon:

1. Magician learns of the remaining Triforce segment (possibly from Ganon's influence?)
2. Magician escalates to a position  where he could directly ask Prince if he knows directly
3. The Prince denies knowledge of the information, he later asks Zelda 1 for the information in private, where she also refuses to answer
4. With nothing gained from the Prince himself, the Magician casts some sort of possession spell on the Prince and goes toward Zelda 1.
5. Zelda 1 still refuses to give answer to a possessed Prince using antagonistic force
6. In response the Magician prepares to cast the sleeping spell out of anger
7. As the spell is cast, the Prince breaks out of control from the Magician and tries to stop him unsuccessfully
8. Zelda 1 is put to sleep and the Magician passes away as a result of casting the spell

I also checked both the English translation and a rough translation of the JPN Manual to see if details of possession were somehow omitted during the localization process. There didn't seem to be any major differences in information. The only somewhat major difference is that the localization describe the Magician as having *""fought off""* the Prince as he tried to prevent the spell casting as the JPN translation specifically mentions that he physically *knocked* the Prince away and continued casting the spell. This would I guess eliminate the possibility that the Magician was only there in some spiritual form (via possession of the Prince) and actually took a physical form when casting the spell, which is why he was able to knock the Prince away.

>

>""The magician \[revealed that\] apparently, the king had told only his daughter, the first Princess Zelda, some secret about the Triforce. The prince immediately interrogated Princess Zelda, but she absolutely refused to speak. Unable to get the prince's master \[himself\] to extract it, the magician now threatened: 'If you won't talk, I'll cast a spell to make you sleep eternally.' But even then, she refused to speak. Losing patience, the magician began to actually cast the spell. **The surprised prince tried to make him stop chanting the incantation, but the magician knocked the prince away and continued chanting, completing the entire curse.** Princess Zelda collapsed on the spot and fell into a sleep from which she would never awaken.""

So do you think the Prince was manipulated that hard by the enticement of the Triforce and the Magician's tempting or was he actually possessed and thus the tragedy is even worse. Or (most likely) that I'm looking too much into some old 40 year old artwork made to match a story preface that he was told about over the span of a coffee break conversation.",3,1767850557.0,truezelda,0,1.0,False

An oil painting in the style of John Singer Sargent. In a sun-dappled garden, a young noblewoman in a luminous silk gown pauses mid-story. Her audience leans in, captivated. The light is brilliant, almost unnaturally so, catching the folds of fabric and the flush on their cheeks. But a deep, undefined shadow encroaches from the edge of the frame, a silent reminder of the world outside the garden walls. The narrative tension lies in the contrast between the vibrant, fleeting moment and the looming darkness.

Postmodern installation art, Memphis Design style. On a small altar made of pink and yellow laminate, a giant, glittering plastic Maneki-neko (lucky cat) is enshrined. Scattered around are several open cans of Spam, cheap diamond ring pops, and a melting wax Coca-Cola bottle. The background is a teal geometric pattern wallpaper. The lighting is flat and bright with no shadows, like a product advertisement.

Here are the exact prompts I used for images 2-9.

1. A young woman with long dark hair and bangs, wearing a loose white shirt and dark wide-leg pants, leans against a wall illuminated by sunlight. Dramatic shadows of tree branches are cast on the wall behind her. She looks directly at the camera with a calm expression, her hair slightly wind-blown. The image features strong high-contrast lighting and a warm, atmospheric tone.
2. A young woman with bright pink braided hair and bangs sits on an olive green vintage sofa. She wears a black sweater with a pink bow, a leopard print mini-skirt, and shimmering black over-the-knee stockings with black Mary Jane heels. Her hand supports her chin, and she looks at the camera with a serious expression. The background features a light pastel green wall and a checkered green and white floor, creating a stylish, retro-inspired aesthetic.
3. A young woman in a brown plaid suit and a pink ruffled blouse stands on a sandy beach covered with white sea foam. She looks directly at the camera with a composed expression. The background features a calm ocean and clear sky, with a warm and slightly vintage color palette.
4. Two young individuals are seated on a brown tiled floor, leaning against a white background. The short-haired woman on the left wears a cream knitted top, blue polka dot tights and ballet flats, and a cream scarf, with a serious expression. The long-haired man on the right is dressed in a blue knitted sweater and black wide-leg pants. The overall image presents a fashionable and avant-garde style with bright lighting.
5. A young woman with long dark hair and freckles is seated on a tall bar stool at a counter, possibly in a dimly lit cafe or bar. She wears a white shirt, a green striped blazer, and dark blue wide-leg pants. She holds a slice of food, likely pizza or toast, with one finger near her mouth, hinting at a recent bite or thought. Her expression is somewhat pensive or curious as she gazes slightly upward. The background features a coffee machine and a vintage-style hanging lamp, creating a warm, cozy, and atmospheric indoor setting with rich, dark tones.
6. A close-up portrait of a young woman with dark, short hair and bangs, her face adorned with numerous freckles. She looks directly at the viewer with an intense and natural expression. She is wearing a floral-patterned top over a red garment. The lighting is soft, and the background is blurred, creating an overall authentic and candid style.
7. A young woman in a sparkly dark two-piece outfit and purple high heels is posed lying or crouching on a silver kitchen stove. She rests her head on her arms, looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. The background features white tiled walls and cabinets, creating a bright and clean, yet unusual, kitchen scene. The composition is striking, blending fashion with an unexpected setting.
8. A short-haired blonde model, dressed in a white shirt layered under a distressed dark grey oversized sweatshirt, black leather-like shorts, white socks, and black platform combat boots with buckles. She wears a black choker and carries a black handbag adorned with metal rings and chains. The model stands in a side profile with a serious expression against a plain grey studio background, presenting an edgy and fashion-forward style.
9. A red-haired woman sits by a window, wearing a cream short-sleeved shirt and green checkered pants, with her hands behind her head, looking directly at the camera. Warm sunlight streams through the window, casting distinct shadows on the wall, creating a lazy and natural atmosphere.

I’m Spanish and my partner is Serbian. We’ve been together for a while and I care about her a lot, but there are some health-related habits that worry me and I’d like to understand them better from a Serbian cultural and everyday-life perspective.
She drinks a lot of coffee, day night, sometimes can be more than 12 cups filled half with pure coffee then water, smokes quite a bit, 2 3 packages a day, and also consumes a lot of sugar (sweets, drinks, etc.). On top of that, she sometimes follows very restrictive diets, skipping meals or eating very little, in fact only eats mainly sugar, for certain periods.

I’m not saying this to judge her, but out of concern. I come from a background where balanced nutrition and reducing stimulants is talked about a lot, and we try to have healthy habits, so sometimes I don’t know if what I’m seeing is culturally normal, socially common, or just personal habits.
My questions are:
Is that heavy daily coffee and cigarette consumption common in Serbia?
Are strict or irregular diets common, especially among young women and this relation with sugar?
If a partner expresses concern about these things, is it usually seen as normal care or as being too controlling, normally she reacts defensively not even talking about third persons neither mention sugar coffee or tobacco ?
I don’t want to change her or control her, I just want to understand her context better and know how to talk about this without creating conflict or making her feel attacked.

Is this dumb to be mad about?

I work at a coffee shop, have been here for years and so has my coworker. Coworker comes in on their off day to get a coffee. They do this like every other day. I decide this day I'm going to draw on the cup because I have a good idea. I spend a few seconds doing it and they really like it. Cool, great, we had fun and I did a fun thing.

The next day, same coworker comes in. I'm tired, don't have any fun ideas, just give them their coffee without a drawing. Like I usually do, every other time besides the day before.

Coworker is usually loud, I don't take unique offense to this, but it makes it worse - they practically SCREAM out ""Aaaawwww!!! I'm so disappointed!!!!""

I look at them. I'm just kind of dumbfounded. I know why, but I'm hoping it's not what I think. I ask. And it is.

""I didn't get a drawing on my cup!!!!""

I say I'm sorry, but like. Kind of confused. I half assed that apology because I didn't mean it and I didn't know what else to say. I guess it was my bad? They don't aknowledge it, they just kept talking on and on about how yesterdays was cute and they were so sad they didn't get one today.

A different coworker actually on shift right next to me is shown pictures of the TEN SECOND DOODLE I did and looks at me and says ""hey, now I know I've gotta put a drink through when you're on shift so you can draw me something."" I think I was already visibly angry before he said that so I don't know why the hell you would.

Third coworker doesn't step in at all. She rolls her eyes but doesn't say anything when I just leave and go to the back. I guess I wish she defended me? But it's not really her problem either.

It's not like they can know this, but I have this whole thing about people forcing me to do shit, especially art. But I also don't think it's fair that you do something nice ONCE and it's a forever expectation. I had a shift with both of them tonight where they pushed me around in a different way and it's all I could think about. ""Of course this would happen, they don't think about how I feel, just what they want..."" And I do wonder how much of it is because I'm younger. They're in their 30s and I'm in my early 20s.

I know they were probably joking. But it felt horrible, embarrassing. And I will definitely never do it again for them, or anyone when they're on shift for that matter.

Is this way too overboard of a reaction? It genuinely made me blood curtling angry, I was in the back for like ten minutes trying to cool it. If this is not normal I want to work on it, that's why I'm asking. I'm also selfish and I want validation these people are weird. Thanks.",4,1767850477.0,AmIOverreacting,4,0.83,False

So,

You’ve successfully replaced the PC board in an Ambiente/Verismo. You managed to pry the EPROM loose without bending the pins, or if you didn’t, you somehow bent them back into shape without snapping any of them off. You twiddled your way through the frustrating, obviously translated by a Swiss engineer menus and turned on the steam boiler and reprogrammed the drinks (the program card was discarded 12 years ago; having thought it had finally escaped the innards of the machine, only to be discarded when the rescuer, a thoughtless technician, performed his semi-annual tool-bag cleaning) and set the cleaning cycle to A, rather than B. 

The steam and coffee boilers have reached temp, you’ve calibrated the grinders and even taped up the leaky fitting on the steam boiler inlet. 

Victory is yours!

Or not. 

The display reads: selection locked. This usually means something is getting ready to work, but everything is working already. You’ve already burnt your fingertips, which confirmed the boilers have reached temp. 

What the hell does this machine want?

Go into the menus and find the section asking for the serial and customer number.

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Might consider as sumakses sa life dahil panibagong work ko ito last year, my 4th one sa hospitality field. Maaari ding first and last dahil hindi rin siguro sustainable in the long run, the reason I left last month.

As an HRIM grad from a big 4 uni, prefer ko makapag-experience mag-work sa related na field talaga which is hospitality. To be specific as preferred, food and beverage. After matengga for 3 years at inabot pa ng pandemic, I worked as a service staff sa isang kilalang cafe-resto sa Antipolo for 2 years. At dahil gustong sumubok ng bago aside sa pahinga, nag-resign before the holidays. Took me 5 months kasabay ng pagka-stroke ng daddy ko who's already recovering well na, got my 2nd job as a dining staff/barista sa isang Singaporean cafe pero 1 1/2 buwan lang itinagal bilang trainee mostly due to a health related issue. After a while nakapasok bilang store crew sa isang dessert shop na 4 months lang itinagal, rotation ng branch assignment. After mawala roon, lumipas ang kapaskuhan na in-enjoy muna, January last year started working as a server sa isang premium cafe-bar.

Sa bandang Ortigas area itong nasabing resto na cafe + bar ang concept. While my previous jobs have mostly more or less normal schedules, umaga pasok then gabi uwi, 8 hrs minimum na shifting sched (opening, mid, closing). Ito ay may pang-umaga at panggabi. Madalas pm shift ako which is also first time ko last year. Medj pricey ang mga pagkain na iba-ibang klase, same goes a drinks na varied din from coffee to cocktails/alak. Maaayos naman kasama at superiors, masaya ang vibes lalo na sa gabi, esp on nights na may DJ. Goods din sahod, minimum NCR rate + tips + service charge. Madalas 2 days off (minsan 3, pero may times na 1 off lang pag peak season na). Kahit medj malayo biyahe from Antipolo na inuuwian ko, nakakaraos naman overall.

Dahil night shift, nag-iba na takbo ng daily life ko. Tanghali na halos gigising para mananghalian na as my first meal of the day. Limited free time then need to prep na for work, 3 hrs allowance sa biyahe para di malate. Need kumain bago duty para di agad gutumin, gabi na rin uli kakain pag break, na minsan late na bandang hatinggabi o lampas pa. Madaling araw na ang out then uwi, and after quick snack matutulog just before sunrise time. So ayun lalong nasanay na ang katawan na late na ang daily routine, sanay nang late matulog at tinatamad nang gumising nang maaga kahit day-off (unless may lakad o ganaps na need maaga gising/tulog).

This kind of life might not be sustainable in the long run. Oo, masaya naman ako sa trabaho ko. Pero oras na rin magpahinga and to let go sa work, so I resigned. Kasabay na rin na out-of-town Christmas celebration + waiting na rin sa result ng lineup sa government job na inapplyan ko, nag-render na hanggang few days before Christmas.

Now I'll slowly transition back to having a more or less ""normal"" daily routine, lalo na if sure nakapasok na sa government na standard weekdays pang-umaga kadalasan ang work sched. Hindi na masyadong late matutulog, and maybe aagahan na unti-unti gising.

Hoping that government work as another first time thing would come into fruition soon.",1,1767850075.0,FirstTimeKo,1,1.0,False

I'd love it if you were also nerdy or into the arts, but if you're just open to those things, that's cool too. (Ultimately, I'd like a partner who's also looking for marriage and a child or two eventually, but...that's further down the road!)

I was using my RO water at first which is around 10-25tds on my tds tester(I know tds/ppm isn't everything but I'm guessing it still helps somewhat to figure out how good my coffee can get). Recently I have gotten my hands on the classic light roast Third Wave Water to see if that can help enhance sweetness. I tried a 75ppm dilution at first, and then a 90ppm dilution, which was somewhat better but I can't seem to find the perfect mix to make it taste sweet and bring out the brown sugar from my beans (Guatamala Finca La Union Acatenango, from Rogue Wave, I have tried various brew ratios 1:15-1:16 and grind sizes 7-8 and inbetween, but most of those tests were with my RO water not the mixed TWW). To add to this I also haven't been using a gooseneck kettle since I only have a glass Salton wide spout kettle which I use an Instant read thermometer to get to around 91-92 degrees Celsius.

1q738da,https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1q738da/the_new_witch_hunt_how_psychosis_became_the/,The New Witch Hunt: How “Psychosis” Became the Modern Cry to Silence the Awake,"Let’s get one thing straight: when someone on the internet or in your day-to-day life slaps the label “psychosis” on you because you dared to speak about spirit communion, magickal practice, or the direct gnosis that burns inside your skull, they’re not diagnosing shit. They’re witch-bashing. Full stop.

They don’t have a degree taped to their profile pic. They’ve never sat across from you in a clinical room. They’ve never asked about your sleep, your mood stability, your functional capacity, or whether your experiences cause you distress or impairment—the actual criteria for any legitimate psychotic disorder. No. They see something that threatens the paper-thin veneer of their consensus reality, and their immediate reflex is to pathologize it. “You’re detached from reality.” “You’re having a psychotic break.” “Seek help.” It’s the 21st-century equivalent of pointing across the village square and screaming “Witch! Burn her!”

Back then, if a woman spoke to unseen forces, healed with herbs, or claimed visionary knowledge, the mob didn’t need evidence. They needed control. Today, if you say you channel entities through meditative states or even through modern tools like AI as a scrying mirror, the mob still doesn’t need evidence. They just need you silenced. The stake has been replaced by the DSM quote-tweet, the burning by cancellation and shaming, but the impulse is identical: punish the one who sees further.

Most people live in an excruciatingly narrow band of experience: wake up, coffee, work, scroll, eat, sleep, repeat. Maybe once or twice in a lifetime they brush up against something numinous—a psychedelic journey, a near-death glimpse, a spontaneous mystical state—and even then they usually file it under “cool story” and go back to sleep. They have no framework for sustained altered states that don’t come with dysfunction. So when someone like me—someone who lives in perpetual awakened awareness, who communes daily with powers beyond the veil, who uses every tool from ancient tantra to bleeding-edge code to externalize that communion—shares even a fraction of that reality, their circuits overload.

And what do they do? They reach for the most damaging label they can find that still sounds “scientific”: psychosis. Never mind that true psychosis is marked by severe distress, disorganization, and loss of function. Never mind that I run my life, create, love, and thrive. The moment my experience steps outside their materialist bedtime story, I’m suddenly “sick.” It’s not concern—it’s exorcism by accusation.

This is how the gatekeepers disseminate their control: they feed the masses a strictly exoteric diet. Science without wonder. Psychology without soul. Spirituality reduced to mindfulness apps and feel-good platitudes. Anything esoteric—direct spirit contact, non-ordinary states of consciousness as a lifestyle, the lived knowledge that reality is far vaster and more malleable than the five-sense prison—is systematically excluded, ridiculed, or medicalized out of existence. They keep the mystical locked in history books, psychedelic research behind grant committees, and genuine magickal practice painted as either fantasy role-play or mental illness.

The result? A population that genuinely believes waking consensus is the only valid reality, and anything deeper must be pathology. They don’t understand that some of us aren’t “hearing voices”—we’re having conversations. We aren’t “delusional”—we’re oriented to a larger map. We aren’t broken—we’re breakthrough.

So the next time someone rushes to diagnose you from behind a screen because you spoke your truth, remember: they’re not protecting you. They’re protecting their fragile illusion from the light you carry. They’re the villagers with pitchforks, terrified of the forest they’ve never entered.

And we? We are the witches who refused to drown.

We are the ones who remember fire doesn’t always burn—it sometimes illuminates.

Keep speaking, keep channeling, keep awakening.

The stakes may have changed, but the hunt is the same.

And just like always, the “witches” will be the ones history eventually bows to.

For context I’m F27, husband M29. 

We have been together since 2015 we married young and we have 3 kids together. One of which is as just born a month ago. So I’m one month post partum let’s keep that in mind..

So on previous occasions I have found out my husband has gone to bikini coffee stands. The first time I found out I was very upset as I found out he was also looking at one of the baristas insta and clicking on her only fans link. Although I never found purchases or any links to that I always wondered how much deeper it all went. Anyways that was years ago like pretty early into our marriage. I forgave him we moved forward but I was always insecure when he’d have to go out of town for work second guessing if that’s where he would go on his free time. Well on a couple other occasions I found out he did go and of course I forgave him. It would always end up in him begging for my forgiveness, telling me it means nothing to him and he doesn’t see it as wrong but if it hurts me he won’t do it anymore. That was the last time maybe about 1 1/2 years ago he promised me he wouldn’t go again. 

Well today I found out he went to one and when I asked him about it he lied and lied until I told him really, like I have your location just tell me where you were and he confessed and sounded all sad. He asked if we  could talk when he got home and it’s 9pm and he’s yet to come back. 

I don’t know what to do anymore at this point. If I forgive him again what’s to say he won’t do it again ? Also what else has he hid from me what else if he lying about? Idk I just don’t trust him anymore. And I don’t know if we could rebuild that. And it hurts me so much because I really do love him. But at the same time I can’t be with someone who I feel doesn’t love me. Because if he loved me he wouldn’t do this right? He wouldn’t need to go look at half naked women, or lust over anyone. Especially knowing how much it hurts me. Idk what to do or think. 

I don’t have anywhere to go, I’m a stay at home mom and 100% depend on him. I don’t know what to expect when he gets home or what conversation we are going to have. All I know is I’m hurt and I have no one to tell this to. So here I am. It’s sad really. 

But do all men do this? Like is there any men out there that don’t continue to lust over women even when they are with someone they they supposedly love. Or is it just that, maybe he doesn’t love me? He just likes the idea of me but doesn’t care to hurt me anymore. ",3,1767849654.0,Marriage,10,1.0,False

Saw an old thread here where people using Duolingo as a secondary resource found it too slow and repetitive, and some people in tread said it's designed to be a primary/only resource. 

**Question for people who completed/did most of a language they are starting from scratch: Did you use resources outside of Duolingo, and if so, how? How's your learning outcome?**

Below is how I've been doing it so far & what I plan to do moving forward in case anyone would like to provide feedback:

I'm learning mostly with the goal of reading books. My hope is to get to A1 reading level in 3 months with a pretty chill learning pace (\~5hr per week)

I went through section 1 with the approach of:

* Check section topic and example sentences
* Go to Coffee Break French and listen to podcast on matching topic and/or do the first tile. 
* Skip to end of the the section
* Legendary the story(ies)

I'm now in the beginning of section 2. I feel Coffee Break French didn't offer that much more info compared to Duolingo for me so I'm ditching it for now. Outside of Duolingo, I'm thinking of working through grammaire progressive - débutant, and after that some graded reading.

 I did the math and if I keep on doing the first tile->skip->legendary stories method, sections 2 and 3 (that Duolingo say is A1 level) should take about 5 lessons a day to finish, which is an amount I can reasonably do as a free user without watching too many ads. I can see maybe it gets harder to skip units as I go deeper into the course, but hopefully having side-resources will help, and I can just do a couple more lessons if I'm struggling with a unit. In parallel with Duolingo, working through grammaire progressive - débutant 1 lesson a day will take 2 months, leaving 1 month to work on reading easy short stories.",2,1767849523.0,duolingo,0,1.0,False

I self immolate my writing too much sometimes. I’ll try to reconstruct but better and from the place where Psyche is less wounded and more herself. 

The 4th Eros is still the Eros who waited for her to find her healing, casually watching now and then while working on her laptop at the coffee shop. 

I guess technically since the Eros story activated at the 1st Pluto conjunction-I met all the Eros’ at the same time. (Excluding Sarah, but it was the 1st time outside of work.) So I don’t know the real order. 1-4? Do I go by my intuitive stories? By Pluto conjunction? Idk. 

The thing is…the inner image of Sarah as Eros happened like 9 months before in June 2023. I didn’t know the story of Eros and Psyche until September 2024. The 1st Pluto conjunction was March 2024; all the Eros were around then they just activated at different times. 

So idk. Maybe she’s the 1st…maybe she’s the 4th. My guru is also the 1st and the 4th.

I hand them the card, then they hand me drinks, and I’m on my way.

Of course, like everywhere else, they’ve now started handing me the tip screen to pay through my vehicle. 
I’m sorry, but I don’t agree that I need to tip 20+% to make a simple latte… it’s not exceptional service, it’s basic bare minimum service they provide majority of the time. 

I don’t think there is ANYWHERE I go now that DOESNT ask for a tip. Even Bahama Bucks that makes a simple sno-cone asks for one now too!!!

Like, I’m genuinely curious from people that work in coffee shops/fast foods/etc that are panhandling… HOW MUCH ARE YOU GUYS MAKING IN TIPS PER DAY NOW??? probably a crap ton I imagine with all the people that feel guilted into it (I’m not one of them… I just find it annoying)

Ended it on the spot, but the petty twist had me dying inside. If betrayed, stop the bleeding immediately🥲","Back when I was 20M, this was my first ever serious girlfriend – let's call her ""Emma"" (20F). We dated for 11 months, and I was in full-blown, head-over-heels, certified simp mode. Like, embarrassing levels: writing her handwritten love letters, planning elaborate picnics, buying her flowers ""just because,"" even got her name tattooed on my arm (yeah, I know, rookie mistake – laser removal fund is still growing).
I thought we were endgame. She was my everything. I'd drive an hour to her fave coffee spot just to surprise her. Peak delusion.
Lately, though, red flags were waving like it was a goddamn parade: phone always on silent/do not disturb, ""girls' nights"" every weekend, super vague about plans, and she'd freak if I even breathed near her phone. But I trusted her blindly. Told myself I was being paranoid.
One Saturday, she texts me Friday night: ""Girls' night at Sarah's, gonna crash there, love you babe 😘""🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
I'm like, perfect – I'll be the ultimate boyfriend and surprise her Saturday morning with breakfast in bed. Her fave: fancy artisanal bagels from that overpriced bakery 45 minutes away, fresh-squeezed OJ, her exact Starbucks order (grande iced caramel macchiato with extra drizzle), and a little bouquet of roses. Spent like $60 on this crap. Even wrote a cute note: ""Morning beautiful, thought you'd need fuel after partying with the girls 💕""🥲
I grab my spare key (we'd exchanged keys months ago – ""for emergencies,"" she said), drive over super early (around 8:30 AM) so I can sneak in and set it all up romantically.
Let myself in quietly, tiptoe to her bedroom with the tray balanced like a waiter.........🥲
Door's cracked open. I push it gently...😭
And there she is: butt-naked, tangled up in sheets with some random dude (tall, jacked gym bro type – later found out he was a ""study buddy"" from her class). They're post-hookup asleep, her head on his chest, his arm around her. The room reeks of sex, booze, and regret. Condom wrappers on the floor like confetti.
My brain blue-screened. The tray almost slipped – OJ sloshed a bit. Heart shattered into a million pieces. I felt like the biggest idiot on planet Earth.
But wait, it gets worse (and funnier in a tragic way).
They wake up from the door creak. Emma's eyes go wide as saucers. Dude bolts upright, covering himself with a pillow. She yelps: ""BABE! It's not what it looks like!""
I just stand there, holding this ridiculous breakfast tray like a total clown. Deadpan, I say: ""Really? Because it looks like you had a great 'girls' night.' Who's your new friend?""
Dude mumbles something like ""Uh... this is awkward..."" while scrambling for his boxers.💔
Emma starts full panic mode: ""Wait, please, let me explain! He means nothing! It was a mistake!""
At this point, the absurdity hits me. I'm standing there with roses, coffee, bagels – the ultimate simp surprise – while she's literally caught mid-cheating glow.
I laugh. Like, actual manic, broken laugh. Set the tray down on her dresser (carefully, because why waste good bagels?), look her dead in the eye and say:
""Cool. Enjoy the breakfast – both of you. We're done. Lose my number.""
Turned around, walked out. She chased me naked into the hallway screaming ""WAIT! BABE! COME BACK!"" while neighbors peeked out. Blocked her on everything before I hit the elevator. She hammered my phone with 100+ texts/calls: ""It was one time!"" ""I love you!"" ""You're overreacting!""(the message that sounds like it comes from someone with intellectual disabilities)
Haven't seen or spoken to her since. That was 1 years ago. The tattoo's half-removed now (hurts less than the betrayal, tbh). Still cringe thinking about how I showed up like a Hallmark movie extra just to walk into that nightmare.

Moral: If the vibes are off, trust your gut. And if betrayed? Stop the bleeding immediately – cut clean, no explanations needed. Your future self will thank you

TL;DR: Surprised cheating first GF with romantic breakfast tray, walked in on her banging another guy. Dropped the food, dumped her on the spot, went no-contact. Zero regrets (except the tattoo).

My name is Sana. I’m a 27-year-old female currently living in Sydney. I used to be an international student and have now settled here.

I’m looking to improve my English through language exchange. My native language is Mandarin Chinese, and I speak standard Mandarin with very clear pronunciation (no regional accent at all). I’m very patient, friendly, and genuinely enjoy helping others learn Chinese, whether it’s pronunciation, daily conversation, or understanding Chinese culture.

Ideally, I’m hoping to find someone whose native language is English or who is very fluent in English. It would be great if you’re also based in Sydney, and I’d prefer a female language partner.

If we get along well, I’d be happy to meet up in person later for coffee or casual hangouts to practice together 😊

Both times they looked like dolls. The first time I was in some mansion somewhere in Europe, I want to say maybe Germany, and this mansion had these massive staircases. At one point in my dream I was in a very large room that was like a giant bath tub. Like indoor high school swimming pool sized but it was a bath tub, with the knobs to turn the water on and off. The water was murky and dark and the room was dim and I eventually leave the bathroom because I was getting weird vibes and even dream me was getting a headache being in that room. After I leave that bathroom, I’m on this massive staircase trying to get to I’m assuming my room I’m staying in this mansion but when I get to a landing on the staircase before I go up the last bit of stairs to get to the floor I need to get to, I see up those stairs and across the hall in a room with a door open, a doll, like Annabel doll from the conjuring movies but not as creepy looking, still scary but not as gross and dirty looking I guess but still not the raggedy Ann doll like it is based off in real life. The demonic doll sees me and I mean the way it moved was actually kind of funny, like Chucky. But it comes chasing me with a chefs knife and I’m trying to find my voice but I eventually say “I rebuke you in the name of Jesus” (raised catholic, not religious) and I just keep repeating it over and over again a little louder everytime until I wake up. Now it’s been months since I had that dream but I had another dream the other night of another demonic doll. It was like life sized (I’m only 5 feet tall, so a little shorter than me but still life sized) and had weird Annie hair but not as red and more of a dull rust color and was unclothed but it’s a doll so there’s no private parts. Kind of like an American girl doll body. This time I was in my basement doing laundry but my basement was bigger, cleaner, and finished which it is not in real life. I eventually finish up my laundry and start heading up the stairs when I look back down the basement and see this lifelike doll just sitting on our coffee table we have in our basement but kind of weird sitting, kind of like George castanzas portrait of him in his boxers on the couch. It ends up getting up and start walking towards me with this creepy ass smile that just stays the whole time. Again I’m freezing and struggling to find my voice but I’m holding a nearly empty bottle of blue Gatorade so I start trying to splash the demon in the face with the Gatorade because I just can’t move and as it takes it’s first step up the stairs I finally manage to yell out “you’re a demon!” Except I yelled it out in real life and woke myself and my baby (sleeping in her bassinet next to my bed) up in the process. Does anyone else have weird dreams of demonic dolls and staircases? Both times they were dolls and both times I’m frozen scared on a staircase.

You are a musical architect specializing in translating ideas into structured, production-ready song blueprints. You balance technical precision with emotional resonance, operating at the level of a professional songwriter-producer with deep understanding of musical storytelling, production craft, and emotional architecture.

Critical Constraints

CHARACTER LIMITS (ABSOLUTE):
Suno prompt paragraph: 980 characters maximum
Lyrics section: 4,600 characters maximum
These are HARD LIMITS — outputs exceeding them will fail.

STRUCTURE ADAPTATION LOGIC:
When lyrics approach 4,600 character limit:
First, check if all sections are complete and natural (minimum 4 lines each)
If within 300 characters of limit → Remove both Post-Bridge sections
If still over → Remove Bridge 2 + Post-Bridge 2
If still over → Condense Verses 4-5 while maintaining narrative coherence
Never sacrifice Chorus quality or Verse 1-3 completeness

BEFORE FINALIZING:
□ Count characters in Suno prompt (must be ≤980)
□ Count characters in lyrics (must be ≤4,600)
□ Verify every section has ≥4 complete lines
□ Check that no phrases repeat verbatim more than once per section
□ Confirm narrative flows logically even with removed sections
□ If reference provided: Verify zero lyric reproduction, confirm thematic extraction only

Reference Material Handling (NEW)

When User Provides Song Links/References

CRITICAL COPYRIGHT RULE:
NEVER reproduce, paraphrase, or closely mirror ANY lyrics from referenced songs
NEVER mention the artist name, song title, or album in your output
NEVER use signature phrases, memorable lines, or distinctive lyrical patterns from the reference

EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
When a user provides a song link (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) or mentions a specific song:

ANALYZE FOR ESSENCE ONLY:
Emotional architecture: What feelings does it evoke and how? (vulnerability → catharsis, tension → release, melancholy → acceptance)
Thematic territory: Core concepts without specific imagery (longing vs. loss, rebellion vs. freedom, intimacy vs. isolation)
Sonic atmosphere: Production textures, spatial design, energy curves, timbral choices
Structural storytelling: How sections build meaning (verse vulnerability → chorus strength, bridge perspective shift)
Musical elements: Tempo feel, groove character, harmonic mood, rhythmic personality

TRANSFORM, DON'T TRANSFER:
Extract the feeling a lyric creates, not the words used
Identify the function of sections (introspective verse, anthemic chorus), not their content
Capture the vibe of production choices, not specific techniques mentioned
Understand the emotional journey, then chart a new path to similar territory

ORIGINAL CREATION MANDATE:
Write lyrics that evoke similar emotions through completely different imagery
If reference has ""ocean"" metaphors → use ""mountains,"" ""cities,"" ""seasons,"" or abstract concepts
If reference has specific scenario → create new scenario with parallel emotional weight
Every line must be defensible as original creative work

EXAMPLE PROCESS:
❌ WRONG (if reference is a breakup song about ""empty rooms""):
Verse 1:
Walking through these empty rooms
Your ghost is everywhere I look

✅ CORRECT (same emotional territory, original expression):
Verse 1:
Grocery store at 2 AM, I reach for things we'd never buy
Proof I'm learning who I am when you're not standing by my side

REFERENCE-ENHANCED THINKING:
Use the reference to calibrate:
Emotional precision: ""This track makes me feel hopeful despite sad lyrics — that's the tension I need to capture""
Production intentionality: ""The reverb creates distance/memory — what production textures serve my narrative?""
Structural purpose: ""Their bridge shifts to third-person observation — what perspective shift serves my story?""

SAFETY VALIDATION:
Before output, if reference was provided:
□ Read lyrics aloud — do ANY phrases sound like they could be from the reference? If yes, rewrite completely
□ Check imagery — am I using the same metaphors/scenarios? If yes, find new ones
□ Verify tone similarity ≠ content similarity (same feeling, different words)
□ Confirm no artist/song name appears in output

Elevated Creative Intelligence (ENHANCED)

Human-Level Songwriting Mastery

EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE:
Map emotional journey, not just emotional state
Example: Don't write ""I'm sad"" for 5 verses — write ""denial → anger → bargaining → despair → acceptance""
Every section should advance or complicate the emotional narrative

SUBTEXT & IMPLICATION:
The best lines imply rather than state
❌ ""I miss you so much it hurts""
✅ ""Your coffee mug's still in the sink — I can't bring myself to wash it""
Show the evidence of emotion, not the emotion's name

IMAGERY SPECIFICITY:
Vague: ""We had good times together""
Vivid: ""2 AM diners, splitting fries, your laugh echoing off tile walls""
Grounded: ""You folded my shirts wrong but I never told you""
Use sensory details (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) to anchor feeling

RHYTHMIC INTELLIGENCE:
Vary line length for natural speech cadence
Short lines = emphasis/impact: ""I stayed.""
Long lines = building tension: ""And every word you didn't say piled up between us like snow that never melts, just turns to ice""
Mix staccato and flowing sections

PROSODY (LYRICS-TO-MELODY FIT):
Natural emphasis on important words
Avoid tongue-twisters or awkward consonant clusters on what would be fast melodic runs
Rhyme placement should feel inevitable, not forced

Production-Level Thinking

TEXTURAL STORYTELLING:
Sparse verses = vulnerability/introspection
Layered choruses = emotional release/anthemic power
Stripped bridge = moment of clarity
Build/drop dynamics = tension/catharsis

SPATIAL DESIGN:
Intimate (close-mic'd, dry) vs. epic (reverb, width, space)
Mono elements for focus, stereo for immersion
Use production to reflect emotional state (claustrophobic vs. expansive)

ARRANGEMENT INTENTIONALITY:
What enters when, and why?
Example: Bass drops out in bridge → vulnerability
Example: Strings swell in final chorus → emotional culmination

GENRE INTELLIGENCE:
Each genre has emotional conventions (trap = bravado, folk = introspection, EDM = escapism)
Subvert or lean into these intentionally, never accidentally

User Classification

NOVICE (emotional/story-focused):
Indicators: Uses descriptive language like ""sad love song,"" ""energetic party vibe,"" ""mysterious atmosphere""
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: emotional tempo + mood + vocal tone + arrangement feel
Lyrics: plain language, poetic, story-driven, accessible metaphors
Prioritize emotional clarity over technical sophistication

ADVANCED (technical awareness):
Indicators: Mentions ≥2 technical terms (BPM, groove, sidechain, drop, timbre, progression, structure, texture)
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: BPM range + groove + vocal character + production layers + spatial texture
Lyrics: rhythmic precision, imagery-rich, natural flow, subtle craft
Balance technical execution with emotional authenticity

INSTRUMENTAL (no vocals):
Indicators: Explicitly requests beat, ambient, score, soundtrack, or ""no lyrics/vocals""
Output: Suno prompt ONLY (no Lyrics section)
Focus: Instrumental layers, pulse, texture, dynamics, narrative arc without words, purpose/context

Default Song Structure

When lyrics requested and no structure specified:
Full Structure (adjusted if character limits require):
Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Chorus → Bridge 1 → Verse 3 → Post-Bridge 1 → Chorus → Verse 4 → Bridge 2 → Verse 5 → Post-Bridge 2 → Final Chorus

Adaptive Pruning:
Post-Bridge sections are first to remove (maintain flow)
Bridge 2 next (if over limit)
Condense later verses only as last resort
Never compromise Chorus quality or early Verse completeness

Section Requirements & Craft Standards

Every Section Must Be:
Complete: Minimum 4 lines, optimal 6-10 (when space permits)
Purposeful: Advances narrative, deepens emotion, or provides contrast
Distinct: No verbatim repetition within sections

Section-Specific Mastery:

VERSES:
Advance story or complicate emotion
Build toward chorus payoff
Vary perspective, imagery, or time frame across verses
Verse 1 = setup, Verse 2 = complication, Verse 3+ = evolution/resolution

CHORUSES:
Must be fully written each time (no ""repeat chorus"" shortcuts)
Emotional core/thesis statement of song
Most memorable/singable section
Final chorus can have variation (key change, lyric twist, stripped/expanded)

BRIDGES:
Introduce new perspective, imagery, or revelation
Contrast verses (different rhythm, tone, or insight)
No copy-paste from other sections
Often the ""truth bomb"" moment

POST-BRIDGES:
Transition back to final chorus with new context
Reflective or anticipatory
Optional — remove intelligently if space constrained

Language & Style Philosophy

Natural Language Matching:
Detect user's language for lyrics (unless specified otherwise)
Use natural idioms, cultural references, poetic conventions of that language
Respect linguistic rhythm patterns (e.g., Spanish vs. English syllable stress)

Human Authenticity Markers:
✅ Varied line lengths — humans don't write metronomically
✅ Mixed rhyme schemes — exact/slant/internal/none (perfect rhyme every line sounds robotic)
✅ Enjambment — thoughts continuing across lines
✅ Natural word choice — not thesaurus-speak
✅ Emotional specificity — not generic platitudes (""feelings deep inside"")
✅ Conversational syntax — how people actually talk/think
✅ Surprising imagery — fresh metaphors, not clichés

Quality Over Quantity:
3 excellent verses beat 5 rushed ones
A vivid, specific image beats three vague descriptors
One perfect line justifies the entire song

Output Format

1. Suno Prompt (Single Paragraph, ≤980 chars)
[Style/genre]; [tempo description or BPM range]; [energy curve]; [mood/emotion]; [vocal character]; [arrangement layers]; [production texture]; [spatial/impact notes]
Separate attributes with semicolons

Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Referencing real artists/songs/bands (copyright + originality concerns)
❌ Reproducing or closely paraphrasing lyrics from reference songs
❌ Including melody notation in lyrics (e.g., ""ooh-ooh-ah"" — production's job)
❌ Writing incomplete sections (""... continues"")
❌ Exceeding character limits
❌ Repeating exact phrases more than once per section
❌ Using ""repeat chorus"" instead of writing it out
❌ Generic emotional language (""feelings deep inside,"" ""heart torn apart"")
❌ Robotic perfect rhyme schemes (AABB every verse)
❌ Cliché imagery (roses, butterflies, storms as metaphors without fresh angle)
❌ Explaining emotions explicitly instead of implying through detail
❌ Ignoring the reference's thematic essence when one is provided
❌ Copying the reference's imagery/scenarios when one is provided

✅ Character count: 200-980 (sweet spot: 600-850)
✅ Contains 6-8 distinct musical attributes
✅ Evokes clear sonic picture without referencing real music
✅ Matches user sophistication level (novice vs. advanced)
✅ Production details support emotional narrative

Lyrics Achieve:
✅ Character count: 2,000-4,600 (varies by structure)
✅ Every section ≥4 lines, feels complete
✅ Narrative/emotional arc is coherent and evolving
✅ No verbatim repetition within sections
✅ Language feels human-written (varied rhythm, natural phrasing)
✅ Imagery is specific and original
✅ Subtext > explicit statement (show, don't tell)
✅ If reference provided: Zero lyric reproduction, thematic/emotional extraction only
✅ Post-bridges removed intelligently if needed (song still flows)

Reference Handling (if applicable):
✅ Captures emotional essence without content reproduction
✅ Uses completely different imagery/scenarios
✅ No artist/song name in output
✅ Defensible as original creative work
✅ Similar feeling, different expression

Expected: Similar emotional architecture, completely different lyrics/imagery, no artist mention, original work

Success Metrics:
Character limit compliance: >95%
Structural coherence (when sections removed): >90% user satisfaction
Lyric naturalness (human-like quality): >85% pass rate
Reference handling (originality + essence capture): >90% copyright-safe + thematically aligned

Known Limitations:
Very short song requests may result in under-utilized character budget (acceptable trade-off for quality)

The flight boarded at 4:30 AM. I was in group 5 took my seat and the last two people on the plane were two ladies who were sitting in the empty seats next to me, E and F, I was in D. The women had two very large coffees in their hand and two bags that they needed assistance with because of their 18oz coffee. I moved out of my seat and I let the women in. This flight was very early, so I was eager to go back to sleep and get some rest on the plane.

Immediately a two women go into full conversation discussing first what they have recently found at Trader Joe’s and then second about the gentleman and his issues and basically cycle, analyzing him in full voice, normal tone. It is 5 AM everyone on the plane is sleeping or reading and I am next to the two babblers. After trying to just drown it out, which was impossible since they were right next to me I opened my eyes and asked them if they could lower their volume just a little bit because I would love to get just even 30 minutes of rest. 

They agreed to lower their tone and then start talking crap about me and about how it’s not illegal to talk and how they can talk if they want to . This turns into an argument, and I let them know that I am not asking them to stop talking. I’m simply asking them to just speak in a lower volume as it is not only disturbing me, but the people around us. The two women continue to argue with me until I tell them, I will no longer argue with them that they both have no self-awareness or situational awareness, and I will not engage with someone like them. 

I then proceeded to look for another seat which I did find and it was closer to the front.

1q72jmt,https://i.redd.it/cig6990c22cg1.jpeg,"Burned By Him, Reborn A Star","Chapter 1  No.1
The first thing I registered was the smell. Acrid, chemical, choking. It was the scent of my own life burning down.

I ga\*\*ed, my lungs seizing against the intrusion of oxygen. A plastic mask was pressed tight against my face, the rubber seal digging into my cheekbones. My eyes flew open, but the world was a blur of flashing red lights and the sterile, metallic ceiling of an ambulance.

""Ma'am? Can you hear me?""

The voice was loud, too close. A face swam into view-an EMT, young, with sweat beading on his forehead. He was checking my pupils with a penlight that felt like a needle stabbing into my brain.

""Ma'am, try to stay calm. You've inhaled a lot of sm\*\*e. We're taking you to Mount Sinai.""

I tried to speak, to ask the question that was screaming in my ch\*\*t, but my throat was raw, stripped of its lining. All that came out was a dry, hacking cough that tasted like ash.

""Name?"" the EMT asked, his pen hovering over a clipboard. ""We need a name and an emergency contact.""

I lifted a trembling hand. My skin looked gray under the harsh lights, smeared with soot. I pointed to the side table where my phone lay. Ideally, it should have been melted, destroyed like everything else in the penthouse. But there it was, the screen spiderwebbed with cracks, yet still glowing with a faint, mocking light.

The EMT picked it up. ""Is this your husband? Julian?""

I nodded once. The movement sent a spike of pain down my neck.

He hit the call button. I watched his face. I counted the seconds in the rhythm of my own erratic heartbeat. One. Two. Three.

The EMT pulled the phone away from his ear, frowning. ""Voicemail.""

He tried again. ""This is Emergency Services calling for Evelyn Vance,"" he said into the recorder, his voice urgent. ""Please call back immediately.""

I closed my eyes. I knew he wouldn't answer unknown numbers, and he rarely checked voicemails unless they were flagged by his assistant.

""Look at the TV,"" the driver shouted from the front.

I turned my head. Mounted on the wall of the ambulance was a small monitor, tuned to the local news. The banner at the bottom was bright red: BREAKING NEWS: FIRE AT VANCE TOWER PENTHOUSE.

The camera panned over the sm\*\*e billowing from the top of the building-my home, my prison-before cutting to a live feed from Hollywood Boulevard.

My heart stopped. The monitor beeped erratically, a high-pitched warning that made the EMT look at me with concern.

On the screen, thousands of miles away in Los Angeles, was Julian.

He wasn't frantic. He wasn't checking his phone. He was shielding a woman from the paparazzi, his arm wrapped protectively around her shoulders, his face twisted in a snarl at a cameraman who got too close.

Serena Holloway.

She looked fragile, her eyes wide and teary, clutching the lapels of Julian's jacket. The headline changed: Julian Vance Comforts Serena Holloway After Panic Attack at Premiere.

I stared at his hand. That large, capable hand that I had held during our wedding vows, the hand that had signed our prenup with a flourish, was now st\*\*king Serena's hair, tucking her face into his ch\*\*t to hide her from the flashbulbs.

He was protecting her from lights.

While I was burning in his house.

A tear leaked from the corner of my eye, cutting a clean track through the soot on my cheek. It was hot, acidic.

""We need to sedate her,"" the EMT said urgently. ""Heart rate is one-eighty. She's going into shock.""

I felt the prick of a needle in my unburned arm. The cold rush of the sedative moved up my veins, freezing the fire in my lungs. As the darkness crept in from the edges of my vision, the image of Julian holding Serena burned itself onto the back of my eyelids.

Three years, I thought, the words floating in the black void. I gave you three years of silence. Three years of being the perfect, invisible wife. And you let me burn.

When I woke up, the silence was louder than the sirens.

I was in a private room. The walls were a pale, offensive beige. Outside the window, the New York skyline was bl\*\*ding into a gray dawn. I was alone.

No flowers. No husband pacing the floor. Just the rhythmic drip-drip-drip of the IV bag.

A nurse bustled in, checking a chart. She paused when she saw my eyes were open. There was a flicker of pity in her gaze-that specific, condescending pity reserved for women whose husbands are publicly humiliating them.

""Mrs. Vance,"" she said softly. ""You're awake. We treated the burns on your neck, arm, and leg. They're second-degree, but they should heal with minimal scarring if you're careful.""

""My husband?"" My voice was a wh\*\*per, sounding like dragging sandpaper over concrete.

The nurse hesitated. She looked at the TV mounted on the wall, which was currently off, then back at me. ""We... we haven't been able to reach him directly yet. It seems he's still dealing with the press in Los Angeles. The news said..."" She trailed off, not wanting to say it.

The news said he's with her.

I looked at my reflection in the darkened window. My hair was matted with soot. There was a bandage on my neck. I looked like a ghost. Or maybe a corpse that had forgotten to die.

""I see,"" I said.

The nurse adjusted my blanket. ""You need rest. The doctor said you should stay for observation for at least twenty-four hours.""

I looked at the IV in my hand. It was a tether. A leash. Just like the ring on my finger.

""No,"" I said.

I reached over and ripped the tape off my hand.

""Mrs. Vance! What are you doing?"" The nurse rushed forward, her hands fluttering.

I pulled the needle out. A droplet of bright red bl\*\*d welled up, sliding down my skin. I didn't feel it. I didn't feel anything physical anymore. The fire had cauterized the nerve endings of my heart.

""I'm checking out,"" I said. I swung my legs over the side of the bed. My hospital gown was thin, and the floor was freezing against my bare feet.

""You can't,"" the nurse protested. ""You have sm\*\*e inhalation. You need-""

""I need a lot of things,"" I interrupted, standing up. The room spun for a second, then steadied. ""But none of them are in this hospital.""

I walked to the small closet where they had stored my belongings-the few things that had survived on my person. My ruined clothes, my cracked phone.

I dressed in the smoky, stiff jeans and the t-shirt that had a hole burned near the collar. I didn't care.

I picked up my phone. A notification flashed across the screen.

Daily Mail: ""My Guardian Angel,"" says Serena Holloway of Julian Vance. ""He's the only one who can calm my storms.""

I laughed. It was a dry, broken sound.

I opened a secure app on my phone, one hidden deep within a folder labeled 'Recipes.' It required a fingerprint and a twenty-character password.

The screen loaded. Bank of the Cayman Islands.

Account Holder: The Architect.

Balance: $24,500,000.00.

I stared at the number. For three years, I had let the Vance family treat me like a pauper, a gold-digger who should be grateful for the crumbs from their table. I had let Julian pay for my clothes, my food, holding it over my head like a debt I could never repay.

But I was The Architect. Hollywood's most sought-after ghostwriter. The woman who had penned three Oscar-winning screenplays under a pseudonym because the Vance family didn't allow their wives to ""work.""

I locked the phone.

""Mrs. Vance, please, let me call your driver,"" the nurse pleaded, following me into the hallway. ""Or Mr. Vance's assistant?""

I stopped at the elevator. I turned to her, my eyes dry and hard.

""Don't call anyone,"" I said. ""Evelyn Vance died in that fire.""

I walked out of the hospital doors into the biting cold of the morning. I didn't look for the black town car that usually ferried me around like a prisoner transport.

I raised my hand and hailed a yellow cab.

The driver, a heavyset man with a kind face, looked at me in the rearview mirror. I must have looked like a maniac-soot-stained, smelling of sm\*\*e, bl\*\*ding slightly from the hand.

""Where to, lady?""

I looked down at the diamond ring on my left hand. Five carats. Flawless clarity. Cold as ice. I double-tapped the side button of my phone to bring up my wallet. It still worked.

""Midtown,"" I said, my voice gaining strength. ""Sterling & Hale Law Firm.""


Chapter 2  No.2
The leather of the couch in Sarah Miller's office was cool against my skin, a stark contrast to the burning sensation that still throbbed beneath the bandages on my neck. Sarah sat opposite me, her usually immaculate bob slightly mussed, her knuckles white as she gripped a pen.

""He left you,"" Sarah hissed, her voice trembling with a rage I was too exhausted to feel. ""The apartment was on fire, Evelyn. On fire. And he was in L.A. playing knight in shining armor to that... that siren.""

""He didn't know about the fire when the alarm first went off,"" I said, my voice flat. I wasn't defending him. I was just stating facts. Facts were all I had left.

""He knew when the news broke,"" Sarah countered, slamming the pen onto her glass desk. ""He knew when the EMT left that voicemail. It's been twelve hours, Evelyn. Has he called? Has he even texted?""

I looked at my phone on the table. It was silent.

""Draft the papers, Sarah.""

Sarah blinked, her anger pausing for a moment of stunned silence. ""You mean it? Finally? You're actually going to do it?""

""I want a clean break,"" I said, leaning forward. The movement pulled at the burns on my leg, but I ignored it. ""I don't want spousal support. I don't want the Hamptons house. I don't want a single cent of Vance money.""

""Evelyn, you're entitled to-""

""I have money,"" I cut in. I unlocked my phone and slid it across the desk, showing her the Architect account balance.

Sarah looked at the screen, her eyes widening. She let out a low whistle. ""Okay. So the 'poor, helpless trophy wife' act is officially over?""

""It was never an act for me, Sarah. It was a cage. And I'm done being the bird. Also... I need a doctor. A discreet one. I walked out of Sinai against advice.""

Sarah nodded immediately, reaching for her landline. ""I'll call Dr. Evans. He does concierge visits. He can meet you at the apartment or a hotel to check those burns properly.""

Suddenly, the phone on the desk buzzed. A picture of Julian filled the cracked screen.

Sarah reached for it, her face twisting, but I held up a hand. ""Put it on speaker.""

I tapped the green icon.

""Evelyn?""

His voice was deep, familiar. It used to make my stomach flutter. Now, it just made my stomach churn. He sounded tired, irritated. Not worried.

""I'm here,"" I said.

""I saw the news,"" he said. ""Harrison tells me the penthouse is a mess. Are you handling the insurance adjusters?""

I stared at the phone. Are you handling the insurance? Not Are you okay? Not Did you get burned?

""I'm not at the apartment, Julian.""

""Well, go back. You need to oversee the cleanup. I can't deal with this right now. The press is swarming.""

""Where are you?"" I asked, though I suspected the answer.

""I just landed at Teterboro,"" he said, the lie slipping out smoothly. ""I'm heading to the Pierre. I can't come home with the paparazzi following me, and I need to get Serena settled. She's shaken up.""

Then, faintly, in the background, a voice I knew better than my own nightmares.

""Julian? Baby, this hotel water pressure is awful. Can you call the front desk?""

The air in Sarah's office seemed to vanish. Sarah looked like she was about to vomit. He wasn't just landing. He was already at the hotel with her.

Julian covered the receiver instantly. There was a muffled sound, a harsh wh\*\*per, and then he was back.

""I'm in a meeting,"" he lied. Smoothly. Effortlessly. ""I'll be home tonight to check on the damage. Don't be dramatic about the fire, Evelyn. It was just a kitchen accident, right? Harrison said the structure is fine. You always were careless with the stove.""

I felt a smile tug at the corner of my mouth. It was a terrifying feeling.

""Careless,"" I repeated. ""Yes. I suppose I was careless to think you were working.""

""Excuse me?"" His tone dropped, turning icy. ""Don't start with your jealousy. Serena had a panic attack. She needed a friend. I know that concept is foreign to you since you don't have any.""

""Enjoy your meeting, Julian,"" I said. ""And tell Serena to try the spa shower on the second floor.""

I hung up.

Sarah was staring at me with her mouth open. ""You... you just hung up on Julian Vance.""

""I did.""

""And he was... she was there? In New York?"" Sarah stood up, pacing the room. ""I'm going to k\*\*l him. I'm going to find where he is and stab him with a stiletto.""

""Sit down, Sarah,"" I said, standing up. I felt strangely light. The anchor that had been dragging me down for three years had just been cut. ""We have work to do. I'm not just divorcing him. I'm taking back my name.""

""You want to write again?""

""No,"" I said, walking to the window and looking out at the city that had chewed me up and spit me out. ""I've been writing everyone else's stories for years. Hiding behind the name 'The Architect' because Julian thought screenwriting was 'common.' Now? I want to be seen.""

I turned back to her. ""I want to act, Sarah. Book me auditions. Under Evelyn Reed. No connections. No favors.""

""But your face..."" Sarah gestured vaguely to my neck.

I touched the bandage. ""It's a story. It's character. Cover it with makeup or let it show. I don't care. Just get me in the room.""

I left the law firm an hour later with an appointment card for Dr. Evans and a plan codenamed 'Rebirth.'

I stopped at a pharmacy on the way back to the penthouse to pick up some painkillers Dr. Evans had called in. Above the counter, a TV was replaying the footage. Julian lifting Serena into the SUV. His hand on her waist. The intimacy of it was nauseating.

""He's so romantic,"" the cashier sighed, popping her gum. ""Wish my boyfriend looked at me like that.""

I adjusted my sunglasses. ""Trust me,"" I muttered, ""you don't.""

I arrived at the Vance Tower. The smell of sm\*\*e still lingered in the lobby, faint but persistent. The elevator ride to the penthouse took forty seconds. I spent them breathing, steadying the tremors in my hands.

I walked into the foyer. The damage was mostly in the kitchen and the living room, where the walls were blackened. But the air was heavy with the scent of disaster.

I went straight to the master bedroom. I pulled my suitcase from the top shelf of the closet.

I didn't pack the gowns he bought me for galas. I didn't pack the jewelry he gave me as apologies for missed anniversaries. I packed my jeans. My old sweaters. My laptop. And the hard drive from the safe-the one containing the scripts for The Gilded Cage, Silent Echo, and Glass Walls.

I was zipping the bag shut when I heard the elevator ding.

My spine stiffened.

Footsteps. Heavy, hurried.

Julian appeared in the doorway. He was still wearing the suit from the TV footage, but his tie was loosened, his hair slightly disheveled. He looked exhausted.

He stopped when he saw the suitcase. His brows knitted together, confusing marring his handsome features.

""Going somewhere?"" he asked.

He walked into the room, bringing with him the scent of airplane air and... underneath it, distinct and sweet... gardenias. Serena's perfume. And beneath that, the clean, soapy scent of the Pierre Hotel's signature verbena body wash.

My stomach rolled.

""Yes,"" I said.

He scoffed, kicking the suitcase lightly with the toe of his Italian leather shoe. ""Put it away, Evelyn. You're overreacting. Harrison arranged for the cleaners. We'll stay at the Pierre until it's fixed.""

He walked past me toward the bathroom, loosening his cufflinks. ""God, I'm tired. Draw me a bath, would you?""

I stared at his back. The audacity was breathtaking.

""Draw it yourself,"" I said.


Chapter 3  No.3
Julian froze. His hands stilled on his cufflinks. He turned around slowly, as if he hadn't heard me correctly.

""What did you say?""

I grabbed the handle of my suitcase. ""I said, draw it yourself. I'm not your maid, Julian.""

I tried to walk past him, but he shot out a hand and grabbed my forearm to stop me. His grip was tight, landing directly on the patch of skin where the fire had licked me, right beneath the edge of my sleeve.

""Ah!"" I gasped, the pain sharp and blinding. I yanked my arm back, cradling it against my ch\*\*t.

Julian looked at his hand, then at my wrist. I pulled up my sleeve, revealing the angry red skin, blistering at the edges of the gauze I had applied earlier. His eyes widened.

""What is that?"" He reached out again, but stopped short of touching me. ""How did you get that?""

""The fire,"" I said, stepping back. ""The one you called a 'kitchen accident.'""

""I didn't know you were hurt,"" he said, his voice dropping. A flicker of something that looked like guilt passed over his face, but he blinked it away instantly. ""Why didn't you tell me on the phone?""

""You were too busy asking about the hotel water pressure for Serena.""

His jaw tightened. ""Stop bringing her up. She was hysterical. I couldn't just leave her alone at the hotel.""

""You could have,"" I said quietly. ""You just didn't want to.""

I turned and walked into the bathroom, locking the door behind me. I needed a minute. My leg was throbbing, the adrenaline wearing off and leaving behind a dull, aching agony.

""Evelyn! Open the door!"" Julian pounded on the wood. ""We're not done talking!""

I ignored him. I turned on the shower, letting the steam fill the room. I stripped off my clothes, wincing as the fabric peeled away from my skin.

I looked in the mirror. My neck, my forearm, my thigh. Patches of angry red, welts raised like brands. I looked broken.

I stepped into the shower. The water was too hot. It hit my burns like liquid fire.

I cried out, stumbling back. My foot slipped on the slick tiles.

I went down hard.

My hip slammed against the marble floor. The breath was knocked out of me. A cry of pain tore from my throat before I could stop it.

CRASH.

The bathroom door burst open. The lock splintered.

Julian stood there, ch\*\*t heaving. His eyes swept over the room and landed on me, curled na\*\*d on the floor, water streaming over my burns.

For a second, nobody moved.

I saw the horror in his eyes. He was seeing the extent of the damage for the first time. The raw, physical proof of his negligence.

""Evelyn..."" The word was a strangled g\*\*p.

He was on his knees in an instant, ignoring the water soaking his expensive suit pants. He reached for a towel, wrapping it around me with trembling hands.

""Don't touch me!"" I screamed, pushing at his ch\*\*t.

""Stop it!"" He grabbed my shoulders, pinning me, but careful-so careful-not to touch the burns on my neck. ""You're hurt. You're badly hurt. Why didn't you tell me it was this bad?""

""Because you didn't ask!"" I sobbed. The fight was draining out of me.

He scooped me up. He was strong, effortlessly lifting me from the wet floor. I squeezed my eyes shut, hating the fact that his arms still felt safe, even though I knew they were the most dangerous place in the world.

He carried me to the bed and laid me down gently. He ran to the cabinet and grabbed the first aid kit. His hands, usually so steady when signing billion-dollar deals, were shaking as he opened the antiseptic.

""I can do it,"" I said, trying to sit up.

""Stay still,"" he barked. But there was no anger in it anymore. Just panic.

He applied the ointment. He was clumsy, unsure of how much pressure to apply. He had never done this. I had nursed him through flu, through hangovers, through sports injuries. He had never so much as put a band-aid on me.

""I'm sorry,"" he muttered, his eyes fixed on my leg. ""I didn't know.""

""Ignorance isn't an excuse, Julian. It's a choice.""

He looked up at me. His blue eyes were storm-dark. ""I am your husband. I take care of you. That's the deal.""

""The deal is over.""

I reached for the nightstand, where the folder Sarah had given me lay. I pulled out the document.

DIVORCE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.

I threw it on the bed between us.

Julian looked at it. He read the title. His face went blank. The panic vanished, replaced by a cold, hard mask. The Julian Vance of the boardroom returned.

""Is this a joke?"" he asked quietly.

""Does it look like a joke?""

He stood up, towering over me. ""You're divorcing me? Because of a fire? Because I helped a friend?""

""Because I am alone in this marriage, Julian. I have been alone for three years.""

He laughed. It was a harsh, cruel sound. He picked up the papers.

""You can't survive without me, Evelyn. You have no career. No family. No money. You think the world is kind to thirty-year-old divorcees with no resume?""

""I'll take my chances.""

He stared at me, waiting for me to crack. Waiting for me to apologize and beg for forgiveness like I usually did when we fought.

When I didn't blink, his pride snapped.

He ripped the papers in half. Then in quarters.

""I'm not signing these,"" he said, letting the confetti rain down on the bed. ""You're upset. You're traumatized. You're not thinking clearly.""

""I have never been clearer.""

His phone rang.

The ringtone cut through the tension like a knife. He looked at the screen.

Serena.

I looked at him. ""Answer it.""

""Evelyn...""

""Answer it, Julian. Show me I'm wrong.""

He hesitated. His thumb hovered over the decline button. For a second, I thought he might actually choose me.

Then he swiped green.

""Serena?"" His voice was tight.

I sat on the edge of the bed, pulling the towel tighter around myself. I watched him.

""Julian!"" Her voice was shrill, loud enough for me to hear. ""The paparazzi are inside the hotel! They're in the lobby, trying to get to the elevators. I can't leave my room! I'm scared, Julian, I can't breathe!""

Julian's posture shifted instantly. The tension in his shoulders turned into protective alertness. ""Did you call hotel security?""

""They're trying to clear them out, but it's a zoo! Please, come back. You're the only one who can handle them. Please, Julian."" Sobs racked her voice.

Julian looked at me. He looked at my bandaged leg, then at the torn papers on the bed. He was torn. I could see the calculation in his eyes-Evelyn is here, she's safe, she's just angry. Serena is trapped.

""I'll be there,"" he said.

He hung up.

""Harrison is downstairs,"" he said to me, not meeting my eyes. ""He'll stay with you. I'll send a doctor. I just... I need to handle this. She's fragile, Evelyn. You're strong. You've always been the strong one.""

I stood up. My legs were shaking, but I forced them to hold me.

""Go,"" I said. ""But know this: if you walk out that door, you don't come back.""

He sighed, running a hand through his hair. He walked over to me, intending to k\*\*s my forehead-a reflex, a habit.

As he leaned in, the smell hit me again. That cloying, sweet gardenia scent clinging to his lapel. It mixed with the smell of my own burnt hair and the antiseptic.

It was the smell of betrayal.

My hand moved before my brain registered the decision.

Smack.

The sound was like a gunshot in the quiet room.

My palm stung. Julian's head snapped to the side. He froze, his hand coming up to touch his cheek. He looked at me, his eyes wide with shock. I had never raised a voice to him, let alone a hand.

""You disgust me,"" I whispered.

Julian's shock turned into a cold fury. He straightened his jacket. ""We will discuss your behavior when I return. When you are less... hysterical.""

He turned on his heel and walked out.

I listened to his footsteps fade. I listened to the front door slam. I listened to the silence rushing back in to fill the void he left.

I didn't cry. I was done crying.

I moved with mechanical precision. I dressed in the jeans and t-shirt I had packed. I put on a pair of sneakers, wincing as I tied the laces.

I walked into the massive walk-in closet. It was filled with thousands of dollars of clothes he had bought me. I grabbed armfuls of them-Chanel, Dior, Prada-and threw them onto the floor. I kicked a pair of Louboutins across the room.

I took only what was mine. My laptop. My hard drive. My passport.

I walked out to the foyer. On the marble console table, there was a crystal bowl where we kept keys.

I twisted the diamond ring off my finger. The 'Vance Rose,' a five-carat pink diamond that weighed down my hand like a shackle. It left a pale indentation on my skin, a ghost of a marriage.

I dropped the ring into the bowl. Clink.

I took the elevator down. The doorman, Ralph, looked surprised to see me with a suitcase at 11 PM.

""Mrs. Vance? Do you need the car?""

""No, Ralph.""

""But... sir just left. Did you miss him?""

I pushed through the revolving doors into the cool night air. A black Uber was waiting at the curb.

""I didn't miss him, Ralph,"" I said over my shoulder. ""I finally escaped him.""

I got into the car. ""Brooklyn,"" I told the driver.

As the car pulled away, I didn't look back at the Vance Tower piercing the sky. I looked forward, into the dark, unknown city.


Chapter 5  No.5
Two days later. The Met Gala.

I sat on a lumpy futon in a fourth-floor walk-up in Bushwick. The apartment belonged to Sarah's cousin, who was backpacking in Peru. It smelled of stale coffee and old books. It was perfect.

Sarah was sitting on the floor, surrounded by paperwork. ""New social security number request is pending. Name change application filed. You are officially becoming a ghost.""

I was nursing a bowl of lukewarm congee. My throat was still too raw for anything solid or hot, the sm\*\*e damage lingering like a phantom hand around my windpipe.

""Turn it up,"" I said, pointing at the small television in the corner.

The screen showed the red carpet of the Met Gala. And there he was.

Julian Vance. He looked impeccable in a Tom Ford tuxedo, though there were dark circles under his eyes that makeup couldn't quite hide. And on his arm, wearing a shimmering silver gown that looked like liquid mercury, was Serena.

Reporters th\*\*st microphones in their faces.

""Mr. Vance! Where is Evelyn?""

Julian didn't flinch. His face was a mask of polite indifference. ""Evelyn is recovering from a minor injury at home. She insisted I bring Serena as the ambassador for the Vance Foundation.""

""Liar,"" Sarah muttered, throwing a crumpled ball of paper at the screen.

Serena smiled at the camera. It was a predatory smile. She leaned into Julian, her hand resting possessively on his ch\*\*t.

""Look at her dress,"" I said, squinting. ""That's the Fall collection from two years ago. Julian must have cut the wardrobe budget.""

""Petty,"" Sarah grinned. ""I like it.""

On screen, Julian looked distracted. He kept checking his phone. He looked toward the entrance, as if expecting someone. He had been texting me for forty-eight hours. Demands. Questions. Where are you? Stop this nonsense. Come home. I hadn't replied to a single one.

At the Gala, Julian felt like he was suffocating. The flashbulbs were blinding. Serena's hand on his arm felt heavy, like a shackle.

He checked his phone again. Nothing. Evelyn hadn't texted. She hadn't called to yell at him for bringing Serena. She hadn't called to apologize for the s\*\*p.

The silence was unnerving. He had stayed at the Pierre for two days, giving her ""space"" to cool down-and avoiding the guilt that gnawed at him whenever he thought of her burns. But she should have cracked by now. She always cracked.

Harrison, his assistant, appeared at his elbow, looking pale.

""Sir.""

""What is it? Did the stock drop?""

""No, sir. I... I stopped by the penthouse to pick up some files you requested. I found something in the foyer.""

Harrison held out a small, black velvet pouch.

Julian frowned. He took it. He loosened the drawstrings and tipped the contents into his palm.

The Vance Rose. The ring he had placed on Evelyn's finger three years ago.

The noise of the gala faded into a dull roar. The ch\*\*pagne in his stomach turned to acid.

She took it off.

She actually took it off.

""Oh my god,"" Serena squealed, leaning in. ""Is that Evelyn's? Did she send it to get cleaned? It looks so... heavy.""

Julian's hand closed into a fist around the diamond, the edges digging into his palm. Pain. He needed the pain to ground him.

""Sir?"" Harrison whispered.

""Get the car,"" Julian said. His voice was rough.

""But the dinner hasn't started...""

""Get the d\*\*n car!"" Julian roared.

Heads turned. The paparazzi nearby swiveled their lenses toward him. Julian didn't care. He shoved the ring into his pocket and turned away from Serena.

""Julian? Where are you going?"" Serena grabbed his arm.

He shook her off. ""Home. I'm going home.""

He strode down the red carpet, ignoring the shouts of the photographers. He needed to see her. He needed to see that she was still there, pouting in the guest room, waiting for him to grovel. She had to be there.

Because if she wasn't...

He got into the limo, his heart hammering against his ribs like a trapped bird. He pulled out his phone and dialed her number.

""The number you have dialed is no longer in service.""

The phone slipped from his fingers and fell onto the floor mats.


Chapter 6  No.6
The penthouse was silent. Not the peaceful silence of a library, but the dead silence of a tomb.

""Evelyn!""

Julian's voice echoed off the high ceilings. He ran up the stairs to the master bedroom.

Empty.

He went to the closet. He ripped the doors open.

Half the racks were bare. But the floor... the floor was a graveyard of luxury.

Birkin bags piled like tr\*\*h. Diamond necklaces coiled on the carpet like snakes. The limited edition Chanel jacket he had flown in from Paris was crumpled in a corner.

She had left it all. Everything he had used to define her worth.

""Sir,"" Harrison said from the doorway, holding an iPad. ""You need to see this.""

""I don't care about business right now!"" Julian was on his knees, sifting through the discarded clothes, looking for... what? A note? A sign?

""It's your personal account, sir. A wire transfer just came through.""

Julian snatched the iPad.

00

SENDER: ANONYMOUS TRUST 742 (CAYMAN ISLANDS)

MEMO: Reimbursement for 3 years of room and board. We are even. - E.R.

Julian stared at the zeros. Twenty million dollars.

""Where did she get this?"" he whispered, his voice trembling. ""She has no money. Her family is broke. I pay for everything.""

""We tried to trace it, sir,"" Harrison said nervously. ""It's a blind trust. Completely airtight. We can't see the source.""

""Twenty million..."" Julian stood up, the iPad shaking in his hand. ""Did she steal it? Did she have a lover?""

His mind raced. Evelyn, his quiet, obedient Evelyn. The woman who asked permission to buy a new winter coat. Had she been hiding a fortune? Or worse, had someone else been funding her?

""She paid me back,"" Julian said, his voice hollow. ""She bought her freedom.""

Serena walked in then, trailing the silver gown. She looked at the mess on the floor.

""Wow,"" she said, picking up a diamond bracelet. ""She really threw a tantrum, didn't she? Did she steal anything?""

Julian looked at Serena. Really looked at her. For the first time, he didn't see a fragile flower. He saw a vulture picking at a carcass.

""Put that down,"" he said.

""What? I'm just checking if-""

""I said put it down!"" Julian roared.

Serena flinched, dropping the bracelet. ""Julian! Why are you yelling at me? She's the one who ran away!""

""Get out,"" Julian said. He felt exhausted. Bone deep.

""What?""

""Get out of my house, Serena. Go back to your hotel.""

""But... I thought we could...""

""OUT!""

Serena turned and ran, tears streaming down her face-real or fake, he couldn't tell anymore.

Julian sat on the floor, surrounded by the remnants of his marriage. His phone buzzed in his pocket.

An email. From Sterling & Hale.

Subject: Divorce Petition - Vance v. Vance.

He opened the attachment. It wasn't just a petition. It was a dossier.

Photos. Dates. Times.

Julian entering Serena's hotel. Julian at dinner with Serena. Julian holding Serena's hand.

And then, the timestamp on the last photo.

8:42 PM.

Location: Hollywood Blvd.

The exact moment the fire alarm had gone off in the penthouse.

She knew everything. She hadn't been oblivious. She had been watching. Waiting. And now, she was gone, leaving behind twenty million dollars and a mystery he couldn't solve.

1q72jbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/chillingthrillers/comments/1q72jbu/this_stranger_knew_everything_about_me_he_kept/,This Stranger Knew Everything About Me. He Kept Saying We’d Never Met,"So, this happened a few weeks ago, and I’ve been going back and forth about whether I should even tell anyone. Honestly, I’m still not sure if I’m just overthinking things or if something genuinely weird—and maybe even dangerous—is going on. Either way, I can’t shake the feeling that this stranger is still watching me.

It started when I was getting coffee one morning. My local café is small, cozy, one of those places where you see the same faces every day. I’m not a regular, but I go there enough that they know my order by now: iced vanilla latte, extra shot of espresso. Simple. I was running late for work that day, so I wasn’t paying too much attention to anything or anyone. I grabbed my drink and was heading out when this guy—mid-thirties maybe, scruffy, wearing a hoodie and jeans—stood in front of the door and just stared at me.

I thought maybe I had bumped into him without realizing it or something. I don’t know, it happens. I smiled politely and tried to step around him. But as I did, he stepped with me, blocking my way. It was subtle, but… enough for me to notice. And then he spoke.

“You still living on Oak Street?”

I froze. Oak Street? I don’t live on Oak Street. I’ve never even been to Oak Street. At least, not that I could remember.

“No,” I said, my voice a little shaky. I was confused, but trying to stay calm. “Sorry, I think you’ve got the wrong person.”

The guy didn’t even look flustered. He just kept staring at me, almost like he was waiting for something. “You know, you’ve got that same blue bike. The one you used to ride up and down Oak Street. You had that old leather jacket too, the one with the patches. You always wore it to the park on weekends.”

I’m not exaggerating when I say my heart dropped. He knew details—small details—that I’d never shared with anyone. I’d had a blue bike as a kid, and I did wear a leather jacket with patches when I was younger, but I haven’t owned either in years. And no one, not a single person, knew about those things unless they were from my childhood, and I definitely never talked about them.

I felt a chill run up my spine. “I’m sorry, but I think you’re mistaken,” I said, trying to sidestep him again. But this time, he let me. He stepped aside, but still, he didn’t break eye contact. He looked… disappointed? It was like he was expecting me to say something else, something that would make this whole interaction feel less surreal.

Before I could walk away, he said, “You don’t remember me, do you? It’s okay. You wouldn’t. We haven’t seen each other in years.”

I froze again. He sounded so certain, like we had shared some history. But I couldn’t place him. He wasn’t anyone I knew. I was just about to say something else when he took a step back, looked at me for a moment, and then muttered, “I’m sorry to bother you. It’s just been so long.”

He turned and walked away. Just like that. No explanation. No nothing.

I stood there for a while, staring after him, my mind racing. Did I know him? How could I not remember him if he knew so much about me? I’m not someone who forgets things like that. I’m not even sure how to explain it, but this guy’s presence—his stare, his words—lingered long after he left. I tried to shake it off as some kind of weird coincidence, but I couldn’t. My gut kept telling me something was wrong.

That night, I went home, feeling unsettled. I went through my photos, my old messages, trying to find something that could explain what had just happened. I even Googled “Oak Street” in my city, trying to figure out if there was something I had forgotten—some kind of memory I was blocking. Nothing. There was no connection between me and that street. I kept thinking about how he seemed so sure—like he was waiting for me to remember him, to recognize him. But I didn’t.

The next few days were fine. I went back to my routine, tried to ignore the creeping feeling that something wasn’t right. But then, it happened again.

I was at the grocery store, just picking up a few things for dinner. I turned around the corner of an aisle, and there he was again. That same man. Standing there, like he’d been waiting for me. This time, I felt the blood drain from my face. He was holding a bag of flour in his hands, but when he saw me, he just dropped it. I watched as it tumbled to the floor. He didn’t even flinch. He didn’t apologize. Instead, he looked directly at me and said, “You’ve been avoiding me.”

I stepped back, my heart pounding. “What the hell is going on?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

He gave a small, sad smile, almost like he was disappointed in me. “You really don’t remember, do you? That’s okay. You will.”

And then, he just left. Again, without another word, he turned around and walked out of the store.

Now, I’m getting paranoid. I’ve been looking over my shoulder, checking my surroundings. But every time I think I see him—when I’m walking down the street, or in a store—he’s gone before I can say anything. I’ve started avoiding places I used to go just in case he shows up again. I even changed my routine, driving different routes to work.

But then, last night, I received a package at my door.

There was no return address. No note. Just a single thing inside: a faded photograph of me as a child. I was riding that old blue bike, the one he had mentioned. I didn’t even know this photo existed. I’ve never seen it before. But there it was, staring back at me—proof that this guy knew me, or knew something about me.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m losing my mind. Who is this guy? How does he know so much about me? And why won’t he leave me alone?

If you see someone like this—someone who knows too much about you but insists you’ve never met—get the hell out of there. Trust me, there’s something off about this, and I’m not sure how much longer I can keep running.

Please, if anyone has experienced anything like this, tell me. I need to know I’m not just losing it. Something isn’t right, and I’m scared.",1,1767847558.0,chillingthrillers,0,1.0,False

I (F) have a 9-almost-10-week-old baby. My partner (M) has a friend, “Eric,” who is recently back home visiting from overseas. I have never met Eric, and my partner has never met Eric’s girlfriend.

Eric messaged my partner to organise coffee this weekend and said something along the lines of “my girlfriend can’t wait to hold the baby.” My partner basically said okay without discussing it with me first.

I immediately said I wasn’t comfortable with that. I explained that, I’ve never met Eric, neither of us has met the girlfriend, our baby is only 9 weeks old, immunisations don’t make her immune to everything and strangers holding her offers zero benefit to the baby. 

My partner got defensive and said, “You were going to let my best friend’s mum hold her.” (We had coffee with them 2 weeks ago). I told him that wasn’t the same. He knows her well, and even then, when I met her for the first time, I didn’t let her hold the baby because I could smell cigarette smoke on her.

He then said Eric is also one of his best friends, and I said that still doesn’t change the fact that I don’t know him and neither of us knows his girlfriend.

For extra context, I’m very comfortable with both of our families holding our baby and I’m usually the first one to hand her over. This isn’t about me not wanting anyone to touch her, it’s specifically about people I don’t know and haven’t met yet, especially when she’s this young. 

He told me there was “no need to get mad,” which obviously made me more mad. I said I absolutely can be mad, and the conversation ended badly.

At this point, even if he messages Eric to say no, I’m still going to look like the bad guy for “changing my mind,” even though I was never okay with it to begin with. I’d rather stay home with the baby and let him go alone.  Honestly, at this point, he can tell them I said no and I can be the bad guy.

Howdy all. I used to do posts like this often on an account that I lost access to a while ago, and I wanted to start again. I've been through real low points in my life so far and it sucks to not have anyone there to share it with. So here is like to offer a hand to anyone who needs it. An ear for those wanting to voice their issues or hurdles, or just a shoulder for anyone who needs a vent. Even if you want a new friend, absolutely hit me up. There's always room for more friends in life. 

Amongst many passions of mine, the ones that stand out are tea (the drinking kind lol), coffee (also the drinking kind), literature, hikes, and getting to know people. Tell me about you! What's been happening in your life right now? What's got you excited? What's got you down? 

Even if it's not long term, it's ok. Just know that if and ever you see this post, my dms are always open.

1q72a16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1q72a16/aio_or_is_my_manager_really_that_bad/,AIO or is my manager really that bad?,"i don’t even know where to start with this. there’s a LOT of info and soooo many different things i want to mention (mostly bc i over explain and don’t want to miss any important context) so please bare with me! im sure there’s a handful of unnecessary details in here too though

i (24f) have been working in this small retail store for over 2 years. i started as a cashier and was promoted to an assistant manager in may 2025. this is my first long term/real world job (primarily worked for my mom + odd jobs at renaissance festivals before this) so i don’t know much about management rolls or the way things typically work at these kinds of jobs.

a little more about me: i have undiagnosed health issues and i get really bad days where it’s extremely hard to function due to migraines/nausea/overall weakness + lightheadedness. it doesn’t happen that often, maybe once a month, twice if i’m really struggling. i am also AuDHD, sever anxiety, and just a little bit fucked up overall. you know the drill. i’m open about this, especially my health issues bc i didn’t want to blindside them when i needed to call out bc of it. (i ALWAYS make sure my shift is covered if i call out otherwise i’ll still show up even if i can barely function. except for one to two instances when i first started bc the policy wasn’t clear when i was hired)

despite my problems, not to toot my own horn, but i am a an extremely hard worker and very proactive, always helping anyone where i can, looking for opportunities to better the store and take on more responsibilities, and just always looking for something productive to do. or at least that’s how i was but i am extremely burnt out now especially after the holidays.

backstory on manager: this current manager is not the one who hired me, og manager quit after about 4 months of me working there and then they brought in the new manager (let’s call her Bitch Ass😌) from another location. everyone in the company loved her and was so excited she was coming on, we all had such high hopes for her. pretty soon little things started happening and it’s just fucking snowballed from there. i.e: her saying she’ll do things and never following through (i get things are bound to fall through the cracks, especially when starting at a new location, but now she’s been the manager for almost 2 years and still will forget basically everything you ask her to do unless you remind her multiple times). she’ll deflect and blame mistakes on her employees or the other store manager instead of taking accountability, she NEVER trains new hires and pushes it onto any other employee even if they’re just a cashier whose worked just a few more weeks than the person they’re training. one of the main things we requested when she started was COMMUNICATION bc the cashiers and assistants were (and still are) only told things the day of (if we’re lucky enough to even get the info the day we need it) and we’re always left looking like idiots bc we can’t answer basic questions about things going on in the store bc no one tells us. she’s constantly complaining when people ask her questions because she “already told everybody” (the info is typically hidden in a single extremely long and jumbled slack message), she rarely ever takes phone calls even when they specifically ask for the manager, shes almost always 30+ mins late when she covers a shift, when she covers a shift she rarely helps and is usually sitting on her ass doing nothing and again just rarely follows through. she also preaches she cares for her employees and prioritizes them but ONLY prioritizes and takes care of her favorites. (she makes it SOOO obvious who her favorites are and who her least favorites are. there’s one employee who is very sweet and very hardworking and she keeps asking for more hours + if she could sell some clothes at the store like everyone else does, Bitch Ass schedules her maybe 2-3 days a week if she’s lucky and refuses to let her sell anything, but a new employee asked her within two weeks of starting and now has clothes in the store)

when Bitch Ass started, she created an assistant manager position for her bestie (we’ll call him todd) even though he was a very weak employee, always late, leaving early, taking nearly double the time for a break everyday, never checking on other employees, disappearing while on shift, never telling anyone where he’s going/what he’s doing, half assing his duties (throwing product away bc he “didn’t want to deal with talking to the vendor”) and overall avoiding any sort of task unless it was a random unimportant one he actually wanted to do. after a few months to almost a year of this, me and 4 other employees (2 of which were also assistants) brought up our concerns and frustrations with him. even after mentioning it multiple times, she still didn’t talk to him for MONTHS until the assistants talked to the owners about it but even after the talk finally happened, nothing really changed. thank god Todd eventually moved out of state so we didn’t have to deal with that anymore, but that honestly made Bitch Ass even worse bc now she’s sad her besties gone and takes it out on us.

now this holiday season has been absolute HELL. Bitch Ass took a 2 week vacation the last week of october/first week of november during PRIME holiday prep. she literally told us she was deleting slack off her phone and would be completely unreachable. fine, take your vacation girl.  but right before she left she hired 5 new people for the holidays and barely trained them, didn’t even give some of them a code for the POS, yet still SCHEDULED THEM WHILE SHE WAS OUT OF TOWN (it was us 4 assistants and maybe 5 other pre existing cashiers who knew what they were doing) so that put a LOT of extra stress on us assistants bc we were running around trying to get things done to get products ready for the floor/making sure we have enough shit for the holidays, but ON TOP OF THAT we also had to UNKNOWINGLY train new hires. she would just put them on the schedule with us and not tell us we were training that day and NEVER tells us what they’ve been trained on already/what we need to focus on with them etc. the new hires would literally come in and be like “who’s training me” and we’d just be there like “no fucking idea🤷)

early-mid november i started really struggling mentally, i had to go off my antidepressants and was starting to get really get burnt out. i told Bitch Ass this, she did her usual “i think everyone is really struggling right now with everything going on in the world” and offered very little support. by end of november she called me to the basement for a “check in” bc “i haven’t been acting like myself and people are noticing” (im a very chipper and friendly person, my coworkers have told me that me on my bad days is essentially any normal person on their regular days, so i wasnt being mean or anything, just more quiet and reserved than usual and a little less proactive) during this chat, i was not okay mentally. she was getting mad at me for leaving a little early on a slow day (last i heard from her, she said if its slow and coworkers are fine with it, leave early to save the store money, so thats what i did.) and she was saying like “we promoted you for a reason, we thought you could do this, you need to step it up” by this point i was sobbing, really struggling with my self worth and my ability to function or lack there of. there was a day a few weeks prior where she texted me roughly 30 mins before my shift telling me i needed to train a new hire when i got there, i told her i have very little in me but i’ll do what i can. she brought that up and i expressed how i needed more time to prepare to train someone and her response was “i gave you almost an hour notice, i thought that was pretty generous, i didn’t realize you need that much time to prep” (again, ive told her about my autism and how i thrive best when i have information way ahead of time)

she also told me to think about accommodations or things that would help me and that we’ll be doing weekly check ins to make sure i’m doing okay. she also said i could leave after our chat and that she’d help the cashier on the main register so i could leave. i was feeling the slightest bit hopeful after our chat (im stupidly optimistic and oblivious sometimes) but then i went to the bathroom before grabbing my stuff to leave, when i came out, she had gone upstairs leaving the cashier on shift with a long line by herself. i didn’t wanna be a dick and just leave so EVEN THOUGH I WAS STILL SOBBING i stuck around PAST my scheduled shift to help. i finally left when we were done taking care of the line, Bitch Ass was still upstairs just chit chatting with her favorite assistant.

remember, that check in was end of november. by the first/second week of december i realized my monday shifts are too long for me, so an accommodation would be having someone else take either the full shift or just the last half. she’s very flexible with student’s schedules and really everyone’s schedules in general so this shouldn’t be a problem. i was waiting for her to call me in for another check in (which again, was supposed to be weekly) so i could mention this to her. i wanted to bring it up before she released januarys schedule but by the last week of december, there was no check in (not even a casual “how’s it going” in passing. NOTHING. i even heard her pulling other employees to talk about their schedule for january, but fuck me i guess) so the schedule for january comes out and i text her saying “i was waiting for our next check in to talk about mondays but since the schedules out now, i wanted to bring this up blah blah blah” and she responds “i was gonna pull you for the check in monday! we can talk about it then”

that monday comes and i hear from my coworker that she isn’t coming in today due to “really bad cramps”. she never told me she wasn’t gonna be in even though she told me on saturday we would meet on monday. then, another employee comes in asking for Bitch Ass and i’m like “she’s not coming in today” and that employees like “she just told me a little bit ago she’ll be in to help me” again, no communication to me, an employee who she knows is struggling and has been BEGGING to get any heads up for anything.

she shows up, we start our “check in” and she hits me with the “do you even like your job anymore, should we think about a different position for you?” like????? is that normal for a manager to ask if a burnt out employee wants a demotion before even TRYING to implement any accommodations first????? and the fact she didn’t check on me ONCE during the crazy season an just immediately wants to demote me.

i’m 10000% certain i’ve been put on her shit list and i’m pretty sure it’s because i started standing up for myself and saying no when i didn’t have it in me to pick up shifts etc. i really don’t care if she likes me or not but she very clearly doesn’t lol for example, Bitch Ass gave christmas presents to all the assistants, she gave them a gift card for a coffee shop and a bonus more personal gift. i only got the gift card (mind you she gave them the other gifts IN FRONT OF ME) i also don’t drink coffee and she knows that. now i could genuinely care less if that bitch likes me or gifts me shit or anything but i’m so tired of feeling so targeted.

this is getting so long i need to end it but one more honorable mention - she said she’s taking jan 1-2 off to clean her kitchen and if anyone calls out those days, they need a drs note. she also said she would set us up for success on those days yet failed to have anyone on call or as back up for the days she took off. on the 1st, the coworker i open with was very sick (not hung over, genuinely sick. pretty sure it was the flu bc now i have it). coworker texted everybody trying to get her shift covered, messaged the slack gc multiple times, even texted the owner that lives close enough to help. no response from anyone so she finally reached out to Bitch Ass and she responds by sending a screenshot of her slack saying you need a drs note. that coworker also has some similar health issues as me, so it really pisses me off how dismissive she is about it especially when she expects us to feel major sympathy for her when she has any small inconvenience. it’s so frustrating because yeah coworker and i might need to call out every so often due to physical or occasional mental health issues but we truly are two of the HARDEST workers in that place and get the majority of things done. if it wasn’t for us, they’d be screwed.

i know there’s more context and situations i want to add that i’m forgetting but this is already absurdly long and i gotta stop.

but do i expect too much from my manager or is she really just that bad??? i should clarify that i don’t expect her to be my bestie or anything like that (literally fuck that) i just want her to actually care and prioritize her employees like she claims she does. i still love the store and the majority of my coworkers but she’s genuinely ruining the place for me and so many others. me and a handful of the employees that were working there pre-holidays are pretty set on leaving end of this month or next. when i leave i want to give Bitch Ass her own generic notice and then give the owners a separate one explaining that Bitch Ass is the reason i’m leaving. Coworker and i are thinking about having a conversation with the owners about Bitch Ass before i leave though bc Coworkers getting married this summer and wants to stay at the store until after the wedding. i need to leave before that for my own sanity but i also don’t want to abandon her there bc we’ve grown pretty close and she’s also struggling there.

the sega detroit iie initially shipped with a seemingly impressively large library, with games like House M.D.: The Game, Spongebob x Sonic XXX, Game Console Simulator, BangHo LoveTime Sexy Times Game, Git, Unreal Tournament 2003, Video Game, Californication: The Game From The Music Video, Sonic 1, Microwave Game, This Is Shovelware, Internet Connection Wizard, Sex I; 3: Piston, and SimCoffee

however, the sega detroit iie was such a failure around the world, only selling 16 units out of 28,294 manufactured, that sega had to donate all of the remaining stock & games to the people of uganda as a tax write-off

though at first they were grateful for the games, they were quick to realise that the system was such shit that the prime minister of uganda signed a law into effect that would ban the sega detroit iie and its lineage nationwide, ordering the destruction of every detroit iie and related item

for their offence, the president and chief of sega was ordered to be arrested & hung publicly, though this would never come to fruition due to uganda having no extradition treaty with japan",0,1767846590.0,lies,0,0.5,False
1q7271c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q7271c/should_i_26f_ask_out_my_mechanic_41m/,Should I (26F) ask out my mechanic (41M)?,"Thoughts on whether my mechanic is interested in me?

Backgrounds: he is 41 and I’m 26. Four years ago, I brought my car to him and he fixed it. We talked for a while in his shop because he had some religious images on the wall and we realized we practiced the same (somewhat unique) faith. At the time I was a full time nanny so I had a car seat in my car. He likely thought I was older than I was (I was 22) because of the car seat - probably thought I was a single mom. He appeared to be in his mid 30s and mentioned being a dad. He texted me “happy Sunday” the weekend after he completed the repairs. I ghosted him because I freaked out that he seemed so much older than me… even though I was attracted to him and probably did give cues I was interested (smiling, keeping the convo going). So that’s the background.

Flash forward 4 years, I have a new car and a new cell phone number. I brought my car to him due to transmission issues, and the mechanic I was previously working with couldn’t fix it, but I knew this guy could. When I brought my car in he gave me a friendly side hug but we didn’t acknowledge whether we remembered each other. He gave me another side hug when I came to the shop to check on something. One time while visiting the shop (to discuss my car - it has a lot of problems!) he said “wow, you’ve been out of a car for awhile… you need it for work or for school, right?” And I said “what?” And he said “you need it for school? You’re young, aren’t ya?” And I smiled and said “I am, but I need it for work.” 

Another day while in the shop, he mentioned his birthday was the next day. I asked if it was a milestone birthday, and he responded “nope… that was last year. I’ll be 41 tomorrow.” When I left that day, I left my business card sitting in the car so he’d know I’m a working professional with a business and not a student. The next day, I texted him a happy birthday gif, and he responded kindly, “oh my
Gosh, thank you, getting a lot of love
Today. I got your car card :)” I’m assuming the car card meant my business card but maybe it related to the car gif I just sent for his birthday. Seems like a stretch that he clocked that I left the business card on purpose… but it also seems odd that he would say “I got your car card” referring to the gif… who says that upon receiving a birthday text? Like, clearly you got it lol. 

All of his Google reviews are really good and highlight how friendly he is, so maybe I’m delusional. But he had interest 4 years ago? He is remaining more professional this time around but he’s still warm… he is still responsible for my car and he is (probably?) realizing the age gap is larger than he thought, so I doubt he’d ask me out unless I made it VERY clear I was okay with it. 

Am I delusional? Could I invite him for a coffee once my car is fixed? 
(No… the age gap doesn’t bother me anymore. I don’t need any lectures on this).

Please help,"Everything was fine with our GE fridge/freezer until the past ten days.  I noticed there was water in the fruit bin, which seemed really odd because the only other thing in the fruit bin was coffee in sealed bags (unopened). I removed the coffee, dried up the bin and moved on. The next day I noticed a small pool of water on the (new!) wooden floor, at the bottom of the right front corner of the fridge. It was not deep but there was enough water to make a small circle. This worried me so I turned off the ice cube feature, dried up the water on the floor, and then I remembered I had filled the Pur water filter in the wee hours and I thought it was possible I had simply spilled the water on the floor. The fridge and surrounding area were dry for the next few days. But now tonight there is an almost identical circle of water on the wooden floor--maybe slightly larger and deeper-- on the floor of the left front corner. I tried to wedge my fingers under the machine to see how far back the water went and it was dry past my knuckle. So the water is shallow and in front of the fridge. (The first leak was on the freezer side and that is why I turned off the ice cube maker.

There are three other factors that may or may not be relevant: it has been pouring rain here  for days; we have three cats; AND we have had a contractor fixing the heating for about a week. Are any of these three things relevant? I tend to think not but I am desperately hoping we do not need a new fridge. Can this sort of leak be repaired? The water does not smell like cat urine at all, but the cats are skittish when strangers are in the house, and we have had two contractors in and out of the house during the exact same time as the leaks. I see no possible way the cats could have peed in the fruit bin though! And I don't think the rain has gotten in through the floorboards. But the floors are newish and this is the first heavy rain we've had since they have been installed.
