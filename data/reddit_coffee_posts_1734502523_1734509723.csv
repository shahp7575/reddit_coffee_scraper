So when I turn on Blue Tooth, this device is always there, and I've lived at different places with my wife. I assumed it was something of hers. Now we're separated, but the device is still there.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Many people strive for a brighter smile, turning to teeth whitening products and procedures. However, a common concern that arises is whether these whitening methods pose a risk to enamel health. To help you navigate through these fears and understand the reality, let’s delve into some myths and facts about teeth whitening and its effects on enamel.

### Myth 1: All Teeth Whitening Products Damage Enamel

One of the most prevalent myths is that all teeth whitening products, whether over-the-counter or professional treatments, are harmful to enamel. While certain products can indeed affect enamel, not all are created equal. For instance, professional whitening treatments, overseen by a dentist, often use carefully formulated agents that minimize enamel damage while still delivering impressive results.

### Fact 1: Some Products Can Cause Enamel Erosion

It’s true that some whitening methods can lead to enamel erosion, especially if used excessively. Products that contain high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or are not correctly applied can weaken enamel over time. Therefore, moderation and following the guidelines set by dental professionals are key in preventing any potential harm.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 2: Home Whitening Kits Are Safe and Effective for Everyone

Home whitening kits come with the appeal of convenience and affordability. However, they are not universally safe or effective for everyone. Some individuals may have sensitive teeth or pre-existing enamel issues, which can be exacerbated by these kits. Always consult with your dentist before starting any home whitening regimen.

### Fact 2: Professional Whitening Is Generally Safer

When considering proficiency and safety, professional whitening options stand out. Dentists can customize treatment plans to your dental needs, ensuring a safer experience. They can also monitor the health of your enamel throughout the process. The result is a more controlled environment, reducing the risk of enamel damage significantly.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Myth 3: You Can Whiten Teeth Too Often

Another misconception is that frequent whitening does not pose a risk. This couldn't be further from the truth. Over-whitening can lead to increased sensitivity and enamel damage, making it critical to adhere to prescribed timelines and frequencies for any whitening treatments.

### Fact 3: Your Dental Health Affects Whitening Results

Your overall dental health plays a crucial role in the effectiveness and safety of teeth whitening. For example, if you already have weakened enamel or cavities, whitening treatments may aggravate these conditions, leading to discomfort and potential complications. Addressing dental issues before pursuing whitening can ensure a positive outcome.

### Maintenance Tips for Enamel Health

To safeguard your enamel health while enjoying the benefits of a bright smile, consider these maintenance tips:

- **Choose milder products:** Opt for whitening products that contain lower concentrations of active ingredients.
- **Follow instructions:** Always adhere to the recommended usage guidelines provided with whitening products.
- **Stay hydrated:** Drinking water helps wash away residue and keeps your mouth healthy.
- **Incorporate fluoride:** Using fluoride toothpaste can help strengthen enamel and protect against erosion.

### Consult Your Dentist for Personalized Advice

If you’re considering teeth whitening, a conversation with your dentist is essential. They can evaluate your enamel health, recommend the safest whitening options, and inform you about potential risks. By staying informed and making educated choices, you can achieve a brighter smile while keeping your enamel intact.

Knowing the facts about teeth whitening can empower you to make better decisions for your dental health. Remember, it’s not just about achieving a radiant smile; it’s about maintaining strong, healthy teeth for years to come.

Best Practices for Safe Teeth Whitening Without Damaging Enamel
---------------------------------------------------------------

When you want a brighter smile, teeth whitening can seem like a great option. However, it’s important to know how to do it safely without causing harm to your enamel. Enamel is the protective outer layer of your teeth, and once it’s damaged, it doesn’t grow back. Here are some best practices you can follow for safe teeth whitening.

### Understand Different Whitening Options

There are various teeth whitening methods available, and knowing the differences can help you choose wisely. Here are some popular options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-office whitening:** This method is performed by a dental professional. It usually uses stronger whitening agents and is the safest option.
- **At-home whitening kits:** Over-the-counter kits are convenient and effective, but read the instructions carefully to avoid misuse.
- **Whitening toothpaste:** These products can help with surface stains but may not change the color of your teeth significantly.

### Choose The Right Product

It’s crucial to select products that are gentle on your enamel. Look for whitening agents that contain hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide in lower concentrations. These ingredients effectively whiten teeth without causing serious harm. Always opt for products that are ADA-approved, as these have been tested for safety.

### Follow Instructions Carefully

Each product comes with specific guidelines. Always follow the recommended usage. Overusing whitening products can lead to enamel erosion and tooth sensitivity. If you’re using strips, for instance, try not to exceed the time limit provided in the guidelines.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Consult With Your Dentist

Before you begin any teeth whitening treatment, it’s wise to talk to your dentist. They can evaluate your teeth and recommend the best treatment that is gentle on your enamel. If you have dental issues such as cavities or gum disease, those problems should be addressed before whitening.

### Take Breaks Between Treatments

Continuous whitening can wear down your enamel. Give your teeth a break between treatments. This allows your enamel time to recover and helps prevent potential sensitivity. It may be beneficial to space out treatments by several weeks or even a month.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Maintain Good Oral Hygiene

Keeping your teeth healthy can enhance the effects of whitening products. Good oral hygiene includes:

- Brushing your teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste.
- Flossing daily to remove food particles and plaque.
- Regular dental check-ups to catch any issues early.

Healthy teeth are more responsive to whitening, and maintaining oral hygiene shows respect for your enamel.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Watch Your Diet

Certain foods and drinks can stain your teeth and affect the results of your whitening efforts. After whitening treatments, consider limiting:

- Dark beverages like coffee, red wine, and tea.
- Colored foods such as berries and sauces.
- Sugary snacks that can lead to cavities.

By being mindful of what you eat and drink, you can prolong the effects of your whitening treatment. Drinking plenty of water and rinsing your mouth after consuming stain-causing items can also help.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Stay Aware of Sensitivity

Some people experience sensitivity after whitening. If this happens, reduce the frequency of use or switch to a milder product. You can also try using toothpaste specifically designed for sensitive teeth. Inform your dentist about any discomfort you experience, as they may have additional solutions to help manage sensitivity.

### Maintain Realistic Expectations

Have realistic expectations about your whitening results. Not everyone’s teeth will respond the same way. Factors such as the natural color of your teeth and the types of stains can vary the final outcome. Embrace the fact that everyone's smile is unique and focus on maintaining a healthy smile rather than just a white one.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
By following these best practices, you can achieve a brighter smile without risking damage to your enamel. Remember, a healthy smile is a beautiful smile!

### Conclusion

Maintaining a bright, appealing smile is something many aspire to, but it's crucial to approach teeth whitening with care. Understanding the relationship between whitening treatments and enamel health is essential. Several myths suggest that whitening can cause irreversible damage to your enamel; however, credible research highlights that many professional whitening products are designed to minimize any potential harm. The truth lies in the proper techniques and formulations used during the whitening process.

To ensure safe whitening, consider consulting with your dentist before starting any treatment. Professionals can provide tailored advice based on your dental history and the condition of your enamel. Choosing products that are specifically formulated for enamel protection can greatly reduce the risk of damage. Moreover, following the recommended application guidelines and avoiding excessive use can help preserve your smile for the long term.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
It's also beneficial to incorporate good oral hygiene practices, such as regular brushing with fluoride toothpaste and maintaining a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. This approach not only supports enamel health but can also enhance the effectiveness of whitening treatments.

Ultimately, by distinguishing fact from fiction and following best practices for teeth whitening, you can enjoy a brighter smile without compromising your enamel. Prioritizing safety and informed choices leads to brighter results without scaring away your confidence. Remember, a radiant smile begins with the health of your teeth.

1hgwrjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hgwrjd/i_took_a_job_as_a_watchman_in_the_bavarian_forest/,I took a job as a watchman in the Bavarian Forest. The previous watchmen never really left.," The Bavarian Forest in southwestern Germany spans about six thousand square kilometres across Baden-Württemberg. Follow it far enough and it merges with the Šumava along the Czech border, eventually leading to the Großer Rachel peak region. This area, known as the Rachelgebiet, is considered the heart of the Bavarian Forest, a place where human activity is strictly prohibited—though not for the reasons most believe.

Much of the Rachelgebiet was once part of the “iron curtain,” a division that kept people and nations carefully separated from the end of World War II through the Cold War. The threat of encountering hostile forces kept the majority of people out, allowing nature to reclaim the land untouched. Or so they say. Entire swathes of fallen trees lay where storms dropped them decades ago, rotting quietly in the perpetual twilight beneath the canopy. No trails, no clearings, no signs of civilization. Just an endless forest so dense you could walk for days without seeing direct sunlight. I'm telling you this now to highlight how isolated and ancient this little part of our world is. And perhaps to explain why no one noticed when people started disappearing.

You can imagine my surprise when I got the job.                                       

I'd just been fired from a warehouse logistics role. My interim boss at the time was a twenty-four year old nepo plant, running the place whilst his father was on vacation. The heir apparent was short-tempered and arrogant. One of those types who think they know everything about running a business because they've read “*Rich Dad Poor Dad*” and follow Gary Vee on Instagram.

So when I warned him that scheduling the bulk wine deliveries during vintage season would overwhelm our already maxed-out cold storage—three hundred containers of temperature-sensitive stock with nowhere to go but the forty-degree loading bay—I did so with the kind of numb acceptance that comes from watching a train wreck in slow motion. The numbers were clear as day: our facility could handle maybe sixty containers max, and that's if we Tetris'd them in there like our lives depended on it. The rest would sit out in the Queensland sun, slowly cooking into very expensive vinegar. But my words just floated through that empty chasm between his ears and disappeared into the nether, probably to join all the other ignored warnings from people who actually knew what they were talking about.

So come five, the workers walked, leaving behind a ghost town of half-stacked pallets and beeping forklifts low on charge. The first trucks were already lined up outside, drivers getting antsy in their cabs, paperwork clutched in sweaty hands. By morning, it’d be a shit show. I remember standing in that empty warehouse, looking up at the mountains of boxes we'd somehow have to deal with, and knew if I came in tomorrow my ass would be handed to me by some private educated ponce with a business degree I'd bet good money he paid someone else to earn.

So I left my vest and company-issued hardhat in my office, dropped my pass and forklift keys into the after hours post slot, and walked out. Drove home in my beat-up Commodore, windows down because the AC had died two summers ago and I'd never bothered fixing it. Blocked every number in my phone still related to that place, cracked open a beer, and started looking for a new job.

That's when I found the listing for the watchtower position.

The job listing was sparse on details but heavy on requirements. Posted by the Brides of Christendom—a religious organization I'd heard whispers about, mostly the kind you'd expect from people who think anything more organized than a Sunday service must be hiding something. They had deep pockets, that much was clear from the salary they were offering. Six figures for what amounted to glorified data collection in the middle of nowhere? I'd have been suspicious if I wasn't so desperate. If I'd been thinking clearly, I might have wondered why they needed someone so far from their usual territory.

I remembered that mess with Kirby Leedy a few years back. Everyone did. She'd gone out to their compound in Warlpiri country to do an exposé on what she called “Australia's most dangerous cult.” Years later, they found what was left of her buried under the red dirt. The investigation went nowhere—no evidence, they said. Just circumstantial links that weren't enough for charges. The compound shut down soon after, leaving nothing but empty buildings and unanswered questions baking in the outback sun.

But here's the thing: I knew a guy called Mason, who'd done their grocery deliveries out there for years. Real straight-shooter type, not the kind to sugar-coat anything. He swore up and down that the women there were nothing but kind. “Just trying to live their faith,” he'd said over beers one night. “Media got it all wrong, mate. Those ladies wouldn't hurt a fly.”

Besides, this position wasn't even in Australia. It was halfway across the world in a forest I'd never heard of until now.

The requirements were specific. They wanted someone strong, with mountaineering experience. Fair enough, given the location. But then they went on about “extraordinary attention to detail” and the ability to take scientific readings. The listing emphasized—almost defensively—that no science background was necessary, however. They were more interested in someone with “passion for nature” and “dedication to environmental preservation.”

*“We believe that true understanding of nature comes from devotion rather than education,” the posting read. “The right candidate will share our commitment to protecting God's creation through careful observation and documentation.”*

It was a twelve-month contract, no renewals possible. That struck me as odd—usually these kinds of positions want someone they can train up and keep. But they were clear: one year, no exceptions. The job involved manning one of their watchtowers solo, taking regular readings that they didn’t specify. They'd provide training, they said. Every second weekend, I'd meet with a Brides of Christendom representative to hand over my data, which would supposedly help with their environmental conservation efforts.

*“Your work will contribute to our understanding of natural cycles and help preserve the delicate balance of God's creation,” the listing continued.*

It was vague enough to sound meaningful while saying absolutely nothing concrete. Like a horoscope, or a prophecy—words you could pour any meaning into, depending on what you wanted to hear.

The isolation part didn't bother me. After dealing with that walking management disaster at the warehouse, a year of minimal human contact sounded like heaven. They'd provide food, accommodation, and all necessary equipment. The pay was enough to set me up nicely afterward, maybe start that ginger beer line I’d had brewing for a while. I was a pretty experienced hiker, was familiar with most of the major peaks in the world—even taught an abseiling class in Croatia for a while in my mid-twenties.

I took another swig of beer and started filling out the application. Sometimes the devil you don't know is better than the one you do—even if that devil happens to be a religious organization with a questionable past and very specific requirements for watching trees in Germany.

Radio silence followed my application. Two weeks of refreshing my email and jumping every time my phone buzzed. I picked up temp work loading trucks—the irony wasn't lost on me—and tried not to think about how quickly my savings were dwindling. In hindsight, they were probably waiting, watching, assessing my desperation level. Making sure I was in exactly the right state of mind when they made their offer.

“Your application was very strong,” she said cheerfully, after introducing herself as Sister Katherine. “Tell me a little more about your background.”

I mentioned my warehouse work, inventory management, quality control. Heavily stressed a life-long interest in nature, even found a way to mention that one time I backed up an entire highway to save a yellow-tailed cockatoo from pancake city. Eventually she prodded:

“And your scientific background?”

“None, really. Basic high school stuff. Bit of chemistry in first year uni before I dropped out.”

There was a pause, then a sound I could've sworn was satisfaction. “Good. Very good. We find those with too much formal education often struggle with our methods. Our approach is more *holistic*, but we’re confident in the results we’ve seen so far.”

The questions continued. Had I ever lived alone for extended periods? Was I comfortable with isolation? Could I follow precise instructions without deviation? Then, almost casually: “Are you a man of faith, Mr. Davies?”

“No,” I admitted. “Never really took to it.”

She laughed, a warm sound that seemed genuinely amused. “That's quite common among our watchmen. Though they all leave believing, one way or another.”

The call ended abruptly with a promise to be in touch. A week later, an email arrived from their HR department—I had the job. A woman (another Katherine, oddly) handled the logistics: plane tickets, necessary paperwork, a list of what to bring. I spent the next month wrapping up my life. Found someone to take over my lease, stored my furniture at my parents' place, sold what I couldn't store.

The flight to Munich felt surreal. From there, I caught a train to Zwiesel, a small town that serves as one of the main gateways to the Bavarian Forest. A woman in a white robe was waiting at the station, holding a sign with my name. Sister Mary, she introduced herself, all smiles and enthusiastic German-accented English.

We drove for hours in a sensible Volkswagen, deeper and deeper into the forest. The roads got narrower, the trees taller, until the canopy above formed an unbroken ceiling that turned afternoon into perpetual twilight. Sister Elsa chatted the whole way about the forest's history, the Bride of Christendom’s conservation work, how blessed they were to have another watchman.

The tower appeared suddenly—a stark silhouette against the darkening sky. Modern construction despite its isolated location, rising maybe forty meters above the trees. My home for the next year.

“Now,” Sister Elsa said, unfolding a map on the tower's small table. “You have twelve locations to monitor.” She traced a perfect circle around the tower, marking each point. “Each requires different readings.”

The next two hours were a crash course in data collection. Soil samples at points one through four, using a special probe that measured something she called “resonance.” Air quality readings at points five through eight, with a device that looked more like an antique compass than any scientific instrument I'd seen. The last four points needed water samples from streams, tested with strips that changed colors in patterns I was told to document but not interpret.

“Every Sunday,” she explained, “you will take the trail to Spiegelau. Five hours each way. You'll meet one of our sisters at the Waldkirche at noon to deliver your readings and receive supplies.”

The training felt rushed, inadequate for the precision they seemed to want. But before I could ask for clarification, Sister Elsa was heading for her car. “The Lord's work awaits,” she said cheerfully. “You'll do fine.”

Then she was gone, leaving me alone in a tower that suddenly felt very tall and very isolated. The single room at the top was sparse but functional—bed, kitchenette, bathroom behind a partition. The windows wrapped all the way around, giving me a 360-degree view of absolutely nothing but darkening forest. Perfect visibility in every direction. Like a fishbowl.

I unpacked my bags, trying to make the space feel more like home. Everything felt fresh, almost surgically so—this place had plenty of fresh air, but I could smell the lingering after-burn of rubbing alcohol, as if this place had received a deep clean before I moved in. Thoughtful. Once I made my bed, I tried to settle in for the night. But as the last enduring rays of the sun disappeared and the forest plunged into absolute darkness, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching from those trees. Looking up at my brightly lit box in the sky. At the time, I laughed it off. I’d spent a good chunk of my life camping and scaring myself shitless. The human imagination is inexorably linked with our primate brain. The mind feeds you images of moving shadows and ghouls under beds and murderers in darkened alleyways. It’s a way of keeping you on your toes, keeping you alive.

So I summed up those feelings of unease that night to little more than my imagination.

As always, I should have listened to my gut.

The first month passed easily enough. I developed a routine: wake at dawn, make coffee, check the weather. The readings took most of the morning—a perfect circle through the forest, each point marked by a small metal stake driven into the ground. I'd document everything in a leather-bound logbook they'd provided, filling page after page with numbers I didn't understand.

The soil probe would hum at different frequencies, displaying readings in units I'd never heard of. Sometimes I'd catch myself staring at it for minutes at a time, watching the needle bounce meaninglessly back and forth, until the damp from the ground would seep through my pants and snap me back to awareness. The air quality device looked like something from a steampunk novel, with brass dials that moved in patterns that seemed to follow no logical system I could discern. The water test strips would bloom in complex color patterns—not just changing to a single shade, but developing intricate designs like tiny abstract paintings. Beautiful, really. I'd find myself mesmerized by them, watching the colors swirl and merge until the morning light had somehow slipped into afternoon.

Sundays became my favorite day. I'd leave before sunrise for the long trek to Spiegelau, watching the forest wake up around me. Sometimes I'd pass clearings that seemed too perfectly circular, or stumble upon old equipment I assumed belonged to previous watchmen—a rusted thermos here, a torn backpack there, once even what looked like a full set of clothes laid out as if their owner had simply evaporated. The town itself was small but alive, a shock of civilization after six days of solitude. I'd submit my readings to whichever Sister was assigned that week, trying not to notice how intently they studied my face, my movements, before they even glanced at the logbook. Then I'd treat myself to a proper meal at the local Gasthaus—something that wasn't from a can or the tower's cramped freezer. I was four weeks in, and never wanted to touch spam again in my life. The owner of the restaurant we would meet in never seemed to remember me from week to week, though I was surely one of his few regular customers. Maybe all us watchmen just looked the same to him after a while.

I tried googling the devices I used for the readings during these brief windows of connectivity, but found nothing even remotely similar. Searches for other watchmen's experiences came up empty. When I casually asked one of the Sisters about previous watchmen, she smiled that serene smile they all seemed to share and said, “The watchtower is new, and so is your position. There weren’t any watchmen before you.”

They also sprung health checks on me. Took longer than submitting the readings.

The health checks were exhaustive. Blood pressure, reflexes, muscle tone, coordination tests. They'd shine lights in my eyes, test my hearing, measure my heart rate after basic exercises. One Sister would take detailed notes while another performed the tests, their pens scratching against paper with the same methodical precision as my measurement devices in the forest. Sometimes I'd catch them exchanging glances, making small marks in margins.

Then came the questions, always the same:

“How is your motivation level?”

“Are you maintaining your energy throughout the day?”

“Describe your sleep patterns.”

“Rate your overall sense of purpose from one to ten.”

They'd inspect everything I bought before I headed back—food, supplies, even magazines. “Certain materials can interfere with the readings,” they'd explain. “Modern chemicals, electronic devices, some dyes. We must protect the purity of our work.” Once, when I bought an extra coffee maker for the tower, Sister Agnes almost seemed alarmed. She confiscated it immediately, muttering something about “artificial stimulation corrupting natural patterns.”

I learned to line my socks with sachets of instant coffee. Some things I just wasn’t willing to give up.

It all seemed excessive but well-intentioned. Until things started to change.

It began with sleep. I'd always been an early riser, but suddenly I was sleeping through my alarms. I'd wake groggy, disoriented, sometimes well past noon. The Sisters noticed—of course they did. “Quite normal,” they assured me during the health checks, making those little marks in their notebooks. “The forest has its own rhythm. Best not to fight it.”

My appetite disappeared. Dishes piled up in the sink because the thought of washing them felt overwhelming. My daily hikes became shorter, then stopped altogether. I'd sit in the tower's single chair for hours, staring at the trees, thinking nothing. Sometimes I'd “wake up” to find I'd been sitting there so long the sun had set, though I couldn't remember what I'd been thinking about or even if I'd been thinking at all.

*Depression*, I thought. I’d experienced it, once. It was something like this.

The caffeine pills and energy drinks I smuggled back helped, but only barely. The Sisters never found them in their inspections—I'd gotten good at hiding things—but sometimes I wondered if they knew anyway. They'd give me these knowing looks during the health checks, especially when testing my reflexes or measuring my pulse. The younger ones would seem almost excited, while the older Sisters would nod with grim satisfaction, as if I were confirming something they'd suspected all along.

I told myself it was the altitude, or seasonal affect disorder, or simple isolation. But I'd done solo work before. I'd lived alone. This was different. It wasn't just tiredness—it was like something was slowly draining away my will to do anything at all. Even writing in my personal journal became an effort. The entries grew shorter, then stopped altogether. The last one before this just trails off mid-sentence, as if I'd forgotten what I was trying to say.

Or why I was trying to say it at all.

Then came the nights.

The first time I saw one, I was about to head out for a late evening reading. Just a figure at first, moving between the trees. It looked like a man, but something was wrong about the way it moved—sluggish, dreamlike, as if every step required immense effort. One foot dragging itself after the other, stumbling over roots and through thickets. It would stop for long periods, head limp and lolling against its shoulder, swaying slightly, as if it had forgotten what it was doing or where it was going.

I watched through the tower windows, telling myself it was just another hiker, though I knew no one else was supposed to be out here. But there was something familiar about the way it was dressed—heavy boots, weatherproof jacket, the kind of gear I wore for my readings. With the aid of a pair of binoculars, I could see dark stains on their clothing, patches where the fabric had started to rot.

They kept appearing. Always at the edge of my vision, always just as the sun set. Sometimes alone, sometimes in pairs. Just lingering among the tree line. Their movements seemed *wrong*. Like people moving through thick syrup, or a video played at quarter speed. Sometimes they'd just stop mid-step and stay there, swaying slightly, for hours. I know because I watched one once, unable to look away, until dawn started creeping over the trees. As the light touched him, he seemed to stir slightly before shuffling deeper into the forest.

I found their traces during my daily readings. Bootprints walking in aimless circles. Old equipment scattered about—rusted soil probes, torn backpacks, logbooks so water-damaged the pages had fused together. Once, I found a jacket identical to mine draped over a tree branch. The name tag was still legible: “Richard K. - Tower 4.” The fabric crumbled when I touched it.

The worst part was the silence. The forest should have been full of night sounds—owls, small animals, wind in the trees. But whenever they appeared, everything went quiet. Like the whole forest was holding its breath. Or like these wandering figures had somehow drawn all the life and energy from the air itself.

I stopped going out after dark.

Started double-checking my locks.

Tried to convince myself I was imagining things.

Then came the crackle from beneath the floorboards.

At first, I thought I was imagining it—another trick of an increasingly unreliable mind. But no, there it was again. A static burst, followed by what sounded like a voice. I found the loose board near my bed, and underneath it, wrapped in oilcloth: an old walkie-talkie and a pack of fresh batteries.

“Hello?” The voice was clear, accented, but eerily tired. “New guy? You there?”

I hesitated before responding. My fingers felt clumsy on the talk button, like they were forgetting how to work. “Who is this?”

“Jabari. I'm in Tower Seven, about fifteen kilometers northeast. Been here ten months now.” His voice had an urgency to it, but also a heaviness, like each word was an effort. “Had a relationship with your predecessor, but he just... disappeared one day.”

“Disappeared? What do you mean?”

‘You’re tower 6. You won’t last long, either. They never do.”

None of his words made sense to me at the time, but they still put the fear of God into me.

‘He left all his stuff,’ Jabari continued, as though to himself. ‘Even his readings. Thought I think I saw him last week, wandering near my tower. He didn't... he couldn't...” He trailed off.

My heart was pounding, though the effort of holding the walkie-talkie was already making my arm tired. “We're not supposed to have contact with other watchmen.”

“No shit.” A dry laugh, followed by a long pause—so long I thought he'd fallen asleep. Finally: “But there are things in this forest they don't tell us about. Things you've probably started to notice. Share your readings with me. I've got a theory—”

“This could be a test,” I cut him off. “From the Sisters.”

Another laugh, but harder this time. “Fine. But when you start to see them—really see them—and you start to suspect what I suspect, I'm here until the end of September. I'll keep my walkie close.” His voice dropped lower. “If I'm still here.”

The transmission ended. I sat there in the darkness, staring at the device in my hands, trying to convince myself I'd imagined the whole thing. Outside, the forest had gone quiet again. And in the distance, barely visible in the moonlight, a figure in a weatherproof jacket stood perfectly still between the trees, head tilted at an odd angle, as if it had forgotten where it was going. Or what it once was.

It’s wild how fiercely your mind fights to rationalize things, even when every instinct in your gut is screaming that something’s wrong. I clung to denial, desperate to believe that ignoring the signs might somehow strip away the horror and leave behind a mundane, harmless explanation. So I turned off the walkie-talkie, yanked out the battery for good measure, and forced myself—through sheer, Herculean effort—to complete my tasks each day. All the while, my energy and will seemed to drain away, hour by hour, as if the very act of existing was bleeding me dry.

Looking back, I should have noticed sooner how wrong the forest was. Not dead—everything was technically alive—but existing in a kind of half-life. Birds would perch on branches for hours, barely moving. Foxes wouldn't chase rabbits but simply wait, conserving energy, until their prey grew too lethargic to hop away. Even the insects seemed sluggish, their wingbeats visible in the thick air. I once watched a wolf pack take down a deer. They didn't chase it. Just followed, walking, for days until it forgot how to run.

My own decline was becoming impossible to ignore. Yesterday, I noticed with growing horror how dark my urine had become and realized I couldn’t remember the last time I’d had water—two days? Three? The fear that came with that realization was enough to push me into forcing down two liters in one sitting. I felt the water soothe my raw, parched throat, but the expected satisfaction never came. No relief, no gratitude from my body—just a hollow, almost mournful acceptance, as though it knew this vital resource was far too little, far too late.

Last Sunday, after what should have been a leisurely, five-hour trek took me almost eight, I broke down and told Sister Agnes I was scared. She didn't seem surprised. Just asked me to hold on one more week while they “arranged a replacement.” Her calm felt rehearsed like she'd had this conversation before.

That was five days ago. I haven't taken a reading since. The devices sit in their case, humming their meaningless songs to no one. This morning, I tried to make it to Spiegelau. I couldn't wait for Sunday. Not after another night of those things circling the tower, their rotting faces turned up toward my windows. Not after I noticed my fingernails had started turning black at the beds, or how my gums bled when I bothered to brush my teeth. The human body can only go so long without proper nutrition before it starts eating itself.

I packed a day bag with what felt like lead weights. Every item—water bottle, compass, emergency kit—seemed to weigh ten times what it should. My hands shook so badly it took three tries to zip the bag closed. The mirror caught my reflection as I headed for the door: sunken eyes in a gray face, cheekbones sharp enough to cast shadows. I didn't recognize myself.

The forest was bright when I set out, morning sun streaming through the canopy. I'd made this trek dozens of times before. *Five hours to town. Five hours to help. Simple.*

The first kilometer was like walking through wet cement. Each step required conscious effort—lift foot, move forward, place down, repeat. My muscles felt like they were filled with sand. I kept checking behind me, certain I'd see them following, but there was only empty forest. The silence felt anticipatory, like the whole woods was holding its breath, watching.

By the second kilometer, I was stopping every few minutes to rest. My vision would blur, then clear, then blur again. The path seemed to stretch endlessly ahead, twisting in ways I didn't remember. Had it always been this steep? This winding? My heart pounded with effort that would have been nothing a month ago.

I started talking to myself, trying to maintain focus. “One foot. Then the other. Just like that. Keep moving.” My voice sounded wrong in the thick air, like it was coming from somewhere else. Someone else.

The weight came gradually. Not physical—something deeper. Like gravity itself was increasing, pulling me toward the earth. My shoulders curved under it. My spine wanted to bend. Every few steps, I had to remind myself why I was walking. Where I was going. Who I was.

I don't remember falling. Just the suddenly close view of dead leaves, the damp smell of soil. My cheek pressed against the earth, and I could have sworn I felt it pulling at me, trying to draw me down and deep*. I should get up,* I thought. *Should keep moving.*

*But why?* The thought came with strange clarity. *Why fight it?* The ground was soft. The air was warm. I was so, so tired.

My eyes closed.

When they opened again, it was night.

I've never been in these woods after dark. Never really understood why that was such a strict rule until now.

The panic gave me enough energy to stumble to my feet. The tower was closer than town—maybe forty minutes in my current state. I pulled out my flashlight and forced myself to move. The beam seemed weak, as if the darkness here was something physical, something that could push back against the light.

That's when I heard them.

Footsteps. All around me. Not coordinated enough to be walking, but not random enough to be stumbling. The sound of dragging feet through dead leaves, coming from every direction at once. The beam of my flashlight caught glimpses: figures in various states of decay, wearing the tattered remains of weatherproof gear. Their skin was gray where it wasn't black with rot, stretched tight over bones. Some still had name tags. Some still had faces.

I recognized one—Richard K. from Tower 4, whose jacket I'd found. His flesh had the waxy texture of a corpse, but his chest still rose and fell with shallow breaths. His eyes were clouded but aware, tracking my movement with terrible recognition. His mouth moved, forming words without sound. Then I realized—he was warning me. They all were. Their mouths moved in silent unison: *“Run.”*

I ran. Somehow. Each step felt like moving through a physical barrier, but terror is a hell of a motivator. Behind me, they followed. Not chasing—they couldn't move fast enough for that. Just inexorably following. Like they knew I'd tire eventually. Like they remembered doing this very thing when they were still fully human, still capable of fear.

One was closer than the others. The remains of a blonde beard clung to his chin in patches. His uniform was newer than the others—couldn't have been out here more than a few months. His eyes met mine as I passed, and there was still something there. Something that remembered being someone. He reached for me with blackened fingers, not grabbing, but beseeching. Wanting to tell me something. Wanting to warn me.

The sound that came from his throat wasn't words. Just a low, continuous moan that might have been despair.

I made it back to the tower. My hands were shaking so badly I dropped the walkie-talkie twice before getting the new batteries in. Behind me, through the windows, I could see them gathering. Some stood perfectly still, faces upturned to my light. Others swayed gently, like seaweed in a current. A few simply sat where they stopped, as if they'd forgotten how to stand.

“Jabari? Jabari, please...”

Static. Then: “...here.” His voice was barely a whisper. “Bad... night?”

“What the fuck is happening here?”

A long pause. Just breathing. Then: “Should tell you... truth. I lied. On application. Have PhD... biochemistry. Knew they didn't want... scientists. But needed job.”

“The readings—”

“Bullshit. All of it.” Each sentence seemed to cost him enormous effort. “Soil resonance... meaningless term. Air quality devices... just pretty toys. Water test patterns... random. Found old records... in floorboards. Letters. Notes from... previous watchmen.”

His breathing was getting worse. “Eight generations. Eight... towers. Always moving... getting closer together. Triangulating.”

“Triangulating what?”

“The source. Why we're all... like this.” A wet cough. “They're measuring *us*... not the forest. Instruments are red herrings. Our dying bodies are… the true reading. How fast we fade. How quickly we... join them. The quicker we…fade…the closer they are…to finding it.’

Through the static, I heard papers rustling. “Wrote it all down... proper analysis. Soil probe generates random frequencies... air quality meter just... runs on clockwork. No actual... sensors. But us? They measure everything. Weight loss... cognitive decline... energy depletion...”

The sound of something heavy falling. Jabari cursing weakly.

“Pattern in tower movements... over decades. They take them down…rebuild…with every missing watchman. Spiraling inward. Getting closer to... finding what they’re looking for. Watchmen in…tower two…last barely a week before they…*fade*.”

A sound from outside made me jump. I stood and peeked through the expansive window. The watchmen were walking away now, disappearing into the thicket of the forest. Like they’d given up. Or knew it was too late for me. I tried to believe it was the former.

“Have to... tell you.” Jabari's voice was fading. “Overheard Sisters... talking. One word. Belphegor. Do you know…who that is? ‘Cause it’s not good.”

The name hit me like ice water. Catholic school lessons from years ago. Sister Mary Catherine's stern voice: “*Belphegor, demon prince of Sloth, who draws men into the sin of spiritual apathy...*”

“Jabari, listen. We need to get out. Meet halfway. Help each other—”

“Too late for me.” His laugh turned into a wet cough. “Haven't eaten... two weeks. Legs don't work anymore. Been using dexies to stay... awake. Almost out. *Run*. While you can. Get help.”

“I can't leave you—”

“Already gone. Just... fighting the inevitable. Run.”

The static took over. I called his name three more times. Nothing.

I threw whatever I could reach into my bag. Caffeine pills. Water. The journal I'd been keeping. My hands moved like they belonged to someone else, clumsy and slow. Each item felt impossibly heavy.

Made it maybe twenty minutes into the forest before I found them. Or they found me. A perfect circle of former watchmen, standing in the pre-dawn light. Waiting. Some wore uniforms from different decades—a catalog of the Brides' victims through the years. Most were so still they might have been statues, but a few swayed gently, like they were listening to some distant music only they could hear.

The exhaustion hits me like a physical wave, but it's different this time. Final. It starts in my bones and radiates outward, turning my muscles to water, my thoughts to mist. My legs fold under me, and I know with terrible certainty that I will never stand again.

I recognize this feeling now. It's not just tiredness. It's surrender. The same thing I've seen in the eyes of every wanderer in these woods. That moment when the last ember of will gutters out, when even breathing feels like too much effort. When existence itself becomes an unbearable weight.

I should be terrified. Should be fighting. But I understand now why none of them run, why they just stand and sway and wait. Fighting requires caring, and whatever's in these woods has drained that from me drop by drop, day by day. All that's left is a vast, empty acceptance.

My mind is already starting to drift. Thoughts slip away before I can grasp them, like trying to hold smoke. But I have enough left—just enough—to write this down. To warn whoever finds it.

The caffeine pills aren't working anymore. My hand can barely hold the pen. Looking at the page, I can see my handwriting deteriorating, the letters becoming shapeless, like my mind is forgetting how they're supposed to look.

I think I'm going to rest now.

Just for a minute.

There's a woman in white standing among the trees. She's watching me, smiling that serene smile they all share. It’s like she knew I wouldn’t make it ‘til Sunday.

Now that I know what they’re looking for, I hope they[ don’t find it.](https://www.reddit.com/user/lemonsorbetstan/comments/1hbq68e/the_brides_of_christendom/)",1,1734508123.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1hgwpp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1hgwpp3/penny_for_your_thoughts/,Penny for your thoughts…,"I’m sorry.

I’m sorry for loving and caring about you more profoundly than anyone else in your life ever has. 

I’m sorry for being the one who would drop everything in an instant whenever you needed me, or whenever you were in distress, without a second thought. 

I’m sorry for treating your dog as if they were my own child, nurturing them through illness with the same dedication I offered you.

I’m sorry for ever showing you my vulnerable and caring side which would sometimes include me getting emotional or my eyes become filled with tears when you would hurt me.

I’m sorry for the understanding I showed during the many times suspicions arose, suspicions I never voiced, though perhaps I should have. 

I’m sorry for not confronting you when anyone else, regardless of gender or identity, might have demanded answers. 

I’m sorry for holding your hair back, and rubbing your back while you were sick, taking care of you so tenderly in those vulnerable moments. More than once. 

I’m sorry for making you dinner, and I’m sorry for taking care of you, taking you to appointments and missing work to take care of you during these movements and several other moments while you weren’t physically ill with the flu, or a virus or some sort. 

I’m sorry for taking on the role of caregiver, for buying your prescriptions, your groceries, and covering the cost of every meal, every coffee. 

I’m sorry I would always hold doors open for you, as well as always using manners—“yes, please” and “no thank you.” 

Im sorry for complimenting you in a genuine manner, and always reminding you of how special you are, and how your presence on earth makes the world a better place because of everything your soul generated into it. 

I’m sorry for complimenting snd reminding you of how special you were in moments where you didn’t personally feel that way. 

I’m sorry for absorbing the hurtful words you threw my way, each one like a shard of glass, cutting deep—“don’t ever fucking talk to me again,” “we’re fucking done,” “I fucking hate you,” “you fucking bitch,” “you entitled piece of shit.” 

I’m sorry because I should’ve endured more of those words towards me, instead of speaking out about the wounds those words inflicted.

I’m sorry for always treating your family and friends with kindness, respect, and genuine interest. For the hours I spent making your condo spotless, every corner, every room—even the toilets and beneath your bed where dust and hair collected over years of neglect. 

Im sorry for standing up for you to others, going as far as filing a police report to ensure your safety when you felt threatened by a harmless homeless man who never bothered or approached you once. 

Im sorry for asking if you needed me to help you when you told me you were going to jump off your balcony, and then proceeded to leave the phone for eight minutes while I heard the balcony door open, and plead and begged for you not to hurt yourself… i’m sorry that you only came back to the phone when i threatened to call the police because i was scared you were going to hurt yourself.

Im sorry i didn’t go through with calling the police back a few days later after i called them and asked if they would then contact you. Im sorry because they would’ve potentially got you the help you needed but im sorry… 

I’m sorry because you told me i wanted to get you committed to a psychiatric hospital even though i never even alluded to that. Im sorry because that’s why i never called the police back. 

Im sorry for not giving into your paranoid snd manipulative thoughts snd tactics such as that one.  

I’m sorry for crafting surprise dates and for uttering words that moved you to tears, words that touched you in ways I never imagined possible. I’m sorry for singing to you, for the times we harmonized or when you broke down over songs your father loved, without me knowing their significance.

I’m sorry I was the man you said your deceased father would have adored. For getting pet insurance for your dog, for ensuring she was well-cared for with new food and vet visits. I’m sorry for the one time I forgot my wallet, prompting you to call me cheap—I never intended to upset you.

I’m sorry for the countless journeys I made by train and bus, traveling to be with you every Thursday through Sunday, sacrificing my time and comfort. I regret never questioning the absence of photos from your “girls trips” and for being subjected to your anger each time I asked about friends whose names I never learned.

I’m sorry you would pick out baby names and pressured me into having sex with you in order to potentially get you pregnant, even though I wasn’t ready because it was still early on, and because we needed to figure a lot out still for me to be in a place where I felt we were both ready for that. 

Actually… I did, several times. I even ensured I didn’t finish inside of you because my boundaries were routinely being crossed, and you continued to do this. You continued to physically restrain me from not moving away from you ever in those moments…

I’m sorry for performing oral on you when you would demand it, while cursing me out simultaneously. 

Remember when you bragged about demanding it later that one day before the Halloween party?

I’m sorry I didn’t just get you pregnant, even though you weren’t ready to be a mother. I’m sorry that I didn’t get you pregnant while there were things occurring behind my back, and bringing a child into that situation would’ve been disturbing.

I’m sorry you would grab my hips and pull me in closer while finishing, even as I resisted, all while telling me to “get you pregnant” and to “fill you up.” I’m sorry for feeling powerless in those moments, for not knowing how to assert myself and just jump from the bed and run… as fast as I could away from you…but you knew that we weren’t ready, and for how deeply that crossed my boundaries.

I’m sorry I didn’t give in to your selfish desires that were masqueraded with “loving intentions”, but in actuality they were for your much darker, self-serving purposes.

I’m sorry that you didn’t get pregnant and therefore couldn’t get out of the things you were doing behind my back the entire relationship as a result. Perhaps I would’ve tired if I knew the truth…

I’m sorry that you beamed with a smile that could light up the world, dreaming of beating your sister to the altar or into motherhood. I’m sorry for discussing marriage and homes in neighborhoods where you wanted to live, even though my job was an hour away.

I’m sorry for inquiring about your “business,” offering help with marketing, using my MBA and business acumen to support you, only to be met with evasion and silence. I’m sorry for questioning the lack of social media updates and your reluctance to speak of clients.

I’m sorry for being okay when you brushed me off after my aunt passed, for respecting your busy schedule over my grief. I’m sorry for always valuing your feelings, your emotions, even when they were wielded like weapons against me—I’m not a fighter, except when it comes to defending my heart.

I’m sorry you didn’t have more time to manipulate, gaslight, and abuse me. I’m sorry for the way your life is built on lies and deceit, for cheating on someone who loved you more than you could comprehend, all while living a double life as an escort.

I’m sorry you lied when we first met and throughout our relationship about working in a completely unrelated field of work than what you were actually doing…

I’m sorry I didn’t ask you more about the “buddies” you would constantly or randomly have and I would get upset despite never meeting them or knowing their names, or anything about them. I’m sorry you would get upset for me asking any further questions about your “buddies” after you brought those men up in conversation.

I’m sorry for you creating random fights between us, somehow making them my fault, and for me apologizing afterwards despite you conjuring these random fights to create space for a couple days between us so you could hang out with your buddies and get paid I suppose?

I’m sorry that I would’ve given you the financial freedom and wealth in addition to ensuring that you were the happiest woman to ever take a single breath on this earth. I’m sorry that you decided being an escort and being paid by lonely men was more important than what we had built and what you had told me you wanted for your life with me… our life.

I’m sorry that confronting you made you anxious, fearing your sister’s judgment. I’m sorry she never learned the truth. I regret the false accusations that led to my arrest, twice, for 25 hours each time, uprooting my life. I’m sorry I never crossed any boundaries, and I have all your texts that contradict the allegations.

I’m sorry I didn’t break bail again to reach out to you.

I’m sorry I didn’t want to break bail again and spend the holidays and beyond, in a jail cell, while I’m still in a mental prison without physically being in a jail or prison cell.

I’m sorry you wore my clothes in a TikTok shortly after my first arrest and flaunted your life as if my world hadn’t shattered.

I’m sorry we didn’t meet years earlier, when we lived across the street, shopped at the same stores, banked at the same place, walked our dogs in the same neighborhood. I wish I could have steered you away from the path you chose, even though I didn’t know you then.

I would’ve saved and protected you. I would’ve never left… ever.

I’m sorry for constantly lifting you up. I’m sorry for speaking to you all day everyday for a year, even when I was busy at work. I’m sorry for listening to you being annoyed with strangers while you were out and they didn’t seem to even do, or say anything to you to make you that upset.  

I’m sorry that you told me you were planning on moving out of the country in a month, despite telling me how we would continue to “work as a couple”. 

I’m sorry I was the one who came up with a plan for us that you seemed very happy with me doing. I’m sorry I accepted you being okay with moving far away from me without a job lined up… or so I believed. 

I’m sorry I didn’t get upset that you had this planned for a while and shared it shortly before you were supposed to move. Did you ever move? I doubt it. I wanted you to follow your dreams and do what made you happy. I always communicated this with you, and did so every time we spoke about this.

I’m sorry that on our last FaceTime call which was the last time I visually saw you… I held back tears because my intuition told me, “this could be the last time you ever see the love of your life”… 

I’m sorry for not acting on that as i should’ve with my months long suspicions about the other stuff…  

I’m sorry you didn’t apologize when I confronted you upon finding out the day before I confronted you about cheating on me and being an escort for our entire relationship. 

I’m sorry you sought out killing me and attempting to ruin my life as a better alternative. 

I’m sorry… I’m sorry because thats what you always wanted snd expected me to say even when it was you who was killing me… first slowly, and then quicker, and now for twisting a dagger of delusion. 

Im sorry that hearing someone you’re in a relationship with say they’re “sorry”. 

I’m sorry that this is one of your many kinks… I’m sorry for giving into your constant, daily abuse. 

And lastly…I’m sorry that despite everything, you remain a beautiful person, inside and out. I see the good in you, the potential for happiness and health, if only you hadn’t destroyed what we had. Your father would want you to be okay.

I remember the night you asked me to promise to always protect you and never leave, and how I held you as tears streamed down my face.

In that embrace, I felt your anxiety, your fear, your loneliness, and I promised to always stand by you, loving you more fiercely than the stars themselves.

“More than the aliens?” you asked, our little joke. Yes, more than those aliens you adore. “I love you, and I’ll love you forever. I’ll never let you go.”

As exam season approaches, many students turn to caffeine to boost their focus and concentration. But does a pre-exam cup of coffee truly enhance cognitive performance, or could it potentially hinder your ability to perform at your best? Consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of caffeine consumption before an exam. Does it improve alertness and memory recall, or can it lead to anxiety, restlessness, and disrupted sleep patterns? How does individual caffeine tolerance and sensitivity influence these effects?

My ex husband who initially seemed loving became abusive ,manipulator and grade A moron soon after we got married , I was in pretty abusive marriage where my ex used to emotionally abuse me , after enduring all this for 1.5 years I finally decided to call it off and gave him divorce. Fortunately my family was supportive throughout all this which made me to stand for myself.

After years of depression and therapies when I was finally ready remarriage , a distant relative introduced me and my parents to divorced guy who was his acquaintance and told us that he is looking for remarriage ,he proposed me his match for an arranged marriage set up ,I was bit sceptical about it first coz I barely knew him but thought to give it try .

soon after we met we got along really well ,he was so calm and composed and genuinely interested in getting to know , I felt so ease with him , we both liked each other and got married at 33 after knowing each other for enough time ,

It was the best decision I have ever made , my now husband is gem of person ,its been 2 years we are married and I am having best time of life , past two years have been blessing to me .I love how he is so calm and gentle to me and nurtures me ,It’s only after experiencing an abusive relationship that I’ve come to fully appreciate what it means to be with a good man. I realised every small thing like from him randomly giving me head and foot massages to never forgetting to kiss me before we sleep and when we wake up daily .He always notices when I’m feeling overwhelmed and brings me a cup of coffee without me asking. We both equally do house chores but on busy days, he quietly take over chores like cooking dinner just to make my life little easier and absolutely the great physical and emotional intimacy!! all these things were so alien to me in my first marriage .

I am very grateful and glad that I met my husband and I love him so much ,my inlaws are nice and my parents are absolutely happy seeing me happy with my life . I got on reddit after years and seeing all the negativity here thought to confess something happy post on cozy winter hehe .

That said, she was a giving and good lover, and for the first time in a long time I felt generally safe and connected to a woman. I decided to really think on it, and before our next date I got sick. She came to visit me while sick, was so genuinely caring, affectionate, and despite me being ill, I had such a lovely time with her.

1hgvvb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hgvvb6/aio_asking_to_have_a_convo_with_sil_before_family/,AIO asking to have a convo with SIL before family holidays when she hasn’t spoken to me for 3 years? ,"Three years ago my SIL Jane and I had a disagreement. It was pretty minor, but Jane was quite offended. I later apologized profusely but she didn’t accept the apology and ended up never speaking to me again and blocked my number. I emailed her a year later with a note saying it would be great if we could move forward, have the family get together, have our kids be able to hang out, etc, and move on. She replied with some really mean words, I’ve never been spoken to like that before. It was really hurtful. She said she didn’t even want her kids around me and I was a horrible person and she never wanted to speak to me again. So I gave up and moved on. 

In the meantime, she was being super difficult with MIL and FIL. My BIL, Joe (their son and Jane’s husband) is a whole other situation, he seems to hate all of us yet we have no idea why. Jane and Joe have been weird to everyone for the past few years, often not returning texts, never wanting to come to family get togethers (regardless of me being there or not), keeping their kids from the grandparents, etc. When asked what is wrong they’ve claimed nothing at all, kind of gaslighting my in-laws in a way. 

Recently Jane has started reaching out to MIL and FIL. She’s had the kids spend more time with them, and has had a few intense conversations with them about all of the things they’ve done wrong over the years. I will say my MIL and FIL are probably the kindest most generous people I’ve ever known. They are the most involved grandparents (when they’re allowed), and they care deeply for their children. The things that SIL was upset about were years-old minor issues that any normal person would brush off and move along, rather than hold onto for literally years. Jane has spoken to MIL and FIL multiple times now, seemingly in an attempt to reconcile, yet she basically comes over and tells them all of the things they’ve done wrong and how much they’ve hurt her. This seems to be a result of some counseling that she’s been doing. Good for her, I hope her mental health issues can be addressed. 

Moving on to the AIO part: I learned that Jane contacted MIL and ask that she and the kids might be included in our holiday celebration this year (they haven’t come for three years). MIL contacted me and hubs to let us know and see how we felt. MIL and FIL at this point will do practically anything to have their kids and their families together, they just want harmony. I get it, but it’s like we’re all at the mercy of Jane and Joe and need to be ready to appease them so they participate. MIL even suggested that we do our celebration at MY house, since Jane and Joe have never been to our new home that we moved into three years ago. We all live in the same town within ten minutes of each other. Our children go to the same school. 

I said that I’m not willing to host. My home is my safe space and Jane’s toxic behavior has gone on for so long and I don’t feel good about having her here. I’d be willing to go to MIL and FIL’s if they host, but I told MIL that to feel comfortable about that I really need to have a conversation with Jane. Coffee, a walk, even a phone call. Just a way to clear the air before a family gathering. In the last three years anytime Jane is in the same space as me she pretends I don’t exist. She doesn’t look at me, walks away, stays on the other side of the room, etc. Won’t even say hi. This has happened at school functions and more recently at a big party for FIL. I’m always willing to even just say hello but she steers clear of me. 

My main issues is how is her way of ignoring me going to go if she comes to the holiday celebration that she’s asked to be invited to? Is she going to do the same thing? It’s not a large gathering (Jane and Joe and their two kids, me and hubs and our three, and MIL and FIL). It’s not like she can just ignore me all evening. I really need her to have some kind of communication with me beforehand. Could be as simple as hello, how have you been, yay let’s move forward and put the past behind us. MIL has been acting a little strange since I made this request, and hubs isn’t saying much. I know he’s thinking that now I’M causing problems with this request. But I don’t think it’s fair for Jane to be allowed to be really shitty for years and then pretend like nothing happened. Why do I have to be the one to just act like things are normal? So AIO to ask that she at least have a conversation with me prior to the get together? 

TLDR SIL hasn’t spoken to me in three years and suddenly wants to be included in our holidays, AIO to ask for a simple conversation before the get together? ",3,1734504191.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

I could tell he was a perv and it was like whatever, but then he pulled me aside one day and made me an offer. He wanted some pics of me, nothing too crazy, just like, cute nudes. I was so shocked at first, but then I was like,""Fuck it, I need the money."" So I did it. Sent him some pics, he sent me some cash. Easy cash for sure. Well, that one time turned into a regular thing. Every few days, I'd send him new nudes, he'd send me more cash. It was our little secret. I felt so dirty and ashamed, but the money was too good. I was like,""Whatever, it's not that bad, right?"" But then one day, he wanted to take things further. I was like,""Hell no, dude!"" I sent the money back and told him to fuck off. I quit that job soon after too. Couldn't handle the guilt anymore, you know?

So my ex and I are both in our late 20's we dated for two years. During that time he broke up with my quite often usually for two days or so (one time it didn't even last for a day?). The previous break up lasted for about 5 days then he came back. Each time I felt so devastated I always welcomed him back in a heart beat except for the previous breakup we spent one or two weeks apart but talking while he was trying to make amends.

When we got back together it felt different. It took about 4 months before he started being slightly annoyed at me for random reasons again then one day, just a week after telling his mom we were moving in together next year he broke up with me. (It's not a fear of commitment he's just unstable, doesn't know what he wants and well many other things but it doesn't have to do with commitment)

I was devastated I cried and cried and after talking we saw each other again one last time (3days after). Then over the next week he slowly disappeared until I called him and he said ""I've made my choice"" then a couple days later he reached out we talked again he said he missed me but we had to do things differently this time...

A few days later I had an appointment in his city so I asked him if we could meet up grab a coffee and talk he said no. I booked a small trip the next week to be able to take some distance and start healing but the day before I left (he didn't know no one knew beside my parents) he reached out to ask to meet up for lunch but I was not available. When I got back he asked me to come over to his place I said no then finally called him to say I was done and completely lost trust.

When he was not breaking up with me he was a good boyfriend supportive, available, generous (very), caring, soft, extremely supportive of my work and projects always available when I needed help.

So now I feel guilty for saying no. I feel guilty because he came back and now I had to say stop.

I've learned that he started smoking heavily again (he quit smoking about 6 months before we met but he used to be a heavy smoker).

But I feel like he was taking me for granted I had to say no because he would have just done whatever he felt like thinking I'd always be there for him. But I deserve respect, commitment and stability. Not someone who needs to loose me multiple times to see my worth.

But I still feel so much guilt for that final ""it's not happening again"".",2,1734503804.0,BreakUp,0,1.0,False

My ex husband who initially seemed loving became abusive ,manipulator and grade A moron soon after we got married , I was in pretty abusive marriage where my ex used to emotionally abuse me , after enduring all this for 1.5 years I finally decided to call it off and gave him divorce. Fortunately my family was supportive throughout all this which made me to stand for myself.

 After years of depression and therapies when I was finally ready remarriage , a distant relative introduced me and my parents to divorced guy who was his acquaintance and he is looking for remarriage ,he proposed me his match for arranged marriage set up ,I was bit sceptical about it first coz I barely knew him but thought to give it try .

soon after we met we got along really well ,he was so calm and composed and genuinely interested in getting to know , I felt so ease with him , we both liked each other and got married at 33 after knowing each other for enough time , 

It was the best decision I have ever made , my now husband is gem of person its been 2 years we are married and I am having best time of life , past two years have been blessing to me , I love how is so calm and gentle to me-nurtures me ,It’s only after experiencing an abusive relationship that I’ve come to fully appreciate what it means to be with a good man. I realised every small thing like from him randomly giving me head and foot massages to never forgetting to kiss me before we sleep and when we wake up daily .He always notices when I’m feeling overwhelmed and brings me a cup of coffee without me asking.  We both equally do house chores but on busy days, he’ll quietly take over chores like cooking dinner just to make my life little easier and absolutely the great physical and emotional intimacy!! all these things were so alien to me in my first marriage .

Tonight I (19F) was sitting in my room and my father came in angry because he said my younger sister (13f) was crying to my mom telling her that she thinks I hate her, that I never spend enough time with her, I treat her differently then our other younger sibling, he kept going and finished by saying, ""its things like this that make someone un alive themselves, and that I should think about that"". I was shocked and honestly angry all I said was ok, because why wouldn't they talk to me instead of just get mad about how she feels. I understand maybe she does fell that way, but even if she does I think it was an over step to use un alive as a way to make me think about my actions when that's not what my sister expressed so it was just away to make me fell bad. For some background, we used to have a rocky relationship when I was younger 14ish because a lot of stuff from my childhood caught up with me, like not feeling like enough. My parents wanted a boy and expressed this and had one after me but he passed tragically a month after birth, then my parents adopted three boys older than me because they wanted a boy so badly, the younger sister was then born as I saw her as just another reason I was not good enough. However I got help for my hurt towards them and have worked through this years ago, so I am not sure how relevant this is other than maybe that's what my parents thought of when she brought this up, but she never new about this cause it was worked out by the time she was old enough understand. Well leading up to this my Mother has expressed since I moved back in to do college from their house that she wished I did more with sister (f13) so I have tried, I take her to dance if I am not working and bring her coffee or tea, I take her thrifting if I have time, Ill take her to the store if I am going and don't have work after which is pretty rare, and I do her hair and make up if she wants when she's hanging out with friends. I thought these small things would be enough to make her happy in our relationship. Me and my sister are extremely close due to the death of our sibling and the crazy adoption to make us depend on each other. I think my parents just assume that is how all sister are but we were just abnormally close. To add to this I am a Junior in college and work 3-4 days a week so I really do not have spare time. So my question is should I be spending more time with her, and was this a normal expectation of me and im the ass whole for not doing more. Or is it normal for us not to be close because of out age difference? Finally my question is even if I am in the wrong it was crazy for my dad to use un aliving to make me think about my actions. If I am completely in wrong please let me know because I want to talk to my parents but I need to know other peoples thoughts. Thanks in advance for anyones response because it is appreciated.

Quick preface - I work on shuts, moving across the Pilbara, 32 y/o female, boilermaker. 

1. Heat: so currently, I'm drinking a whole lot of water x2 camelpacks, 2x 3L bottle daily, one liquid IV, wearing a hat and seeking shade/aircon when I can, eating more salt during smoko than I'd normally eat, max 1 coffee per day. Even without physically working, I am getting headaches and the shakes with the above routine. When I'm working, it's easier to ignore but it's obviously still effecting me. I'm yet to do any boily work as well, so once that comes into play, I'll need all the help I can get. Plus it's only December. 

Acclimatising is obviously a thing and I'm in the process of it now. Any advice on the best forms of acclimatising and any suggestions on what I can add to the above? 

2. Nosebleeds. I got two on my last swing. It's either heat, aircon, dust or dry heat causing it. Nasal sprays have been recommended and I'm thinking of asking my doctor to get my nose cauterized. Anyone else experience this or can recommend a way to manage it and keep nose bleeds at bay?

3. Going from hot days, then sleeping in aircon. Obviously dehydrating me. I keep a bowl of water near my bed during sleep to try and put moisture in the air. I wake up fucking groggy, have a liquid IV but I can tell the combo isn't helping. 

4. PH balance. This one's for the women in mining. Hard water, disrupts PH balance and is disrupting the 'delicate' PH balance. There are showerheads that filter but in all honesty, I can't do that when I'm on shuts and don't have a permanent room. Any other suggestions? 

5. IM NOT GETTING A NEW JOB. 

6. I'm not gyming on site. I'd rather prioritise sleep and recovery, than sacrificing time to the gym when my body is naturally going to get conditioned via this line of work. 

I'm loving this change of career. It's what I've always wanted and I can see myself being good at it, so long as I can manage and be disciplined about how my body will cope with it, as healthily as possible.

Anyway, any suggestions are super appreciated!! Thanks in advance!",1,1734503618.0,mining,9,0.99,False

Swak as in. The guy I’ve been seeing lately, we had so many similarities in life experiences, circumstances, and medyo in humor din. May moments kami tipong ""Ha, parehas tayo dun?!"" It felt like almost everything just clicked. Same vibe, akala ko same headspace rin. We had the same taste in food (which matters a lot to me since I love food). We were spontaneous, fun and Idk everything just felt right. Parang may malaking spark, ang rare nung mga pagkakaparehas namin, and it was like the first time I encountered something like that. I'd say he was attracted to me, sinasabi naman niya sa'kin, pero not in direct words na ""ang ganda ganda mo"", at kita ko lang din sa actions niya. Medyo attracted din ako sa kanya, I like his charm tapos mahilig din ako sa chinito. Ang cute ng pagka-clingy rin niya, laging nag-aaya kung kailan ulit magkikita. Habang kinukuwento ko 'to, nakaka-miss tuloy yung first few moments ng encounter namin ulit

(Pero one thing na napansin ko talaga nung una pa lang, ang sungit ng aura niya, wala siyang happy energy vibe, yung masungit na lalaking bida ng Kdrama. Ganun yung vibe, which is siguro yun yung naging part din ng connection sa turning point eventually)

We also went to the same university, took the same course (before I shifted), and our values and principles in life were pretty similar. Nga lang, pro-choice ako, pro-life siya, pero pweds naman mapagkasunduan depende sa sitwasyon. We both tried to be kind to others, both empathetic. Our connection felt so natural that intimacy followed. We got physically closer, always cuddling whenever we were together. Pinabisita ko kasi siya agad sa condo ko, kasi kakatamad na sa labas, magastos din at mas komportable sa place ko. Na-miss ko rin kasi yung physical presence, yung having someone with me. I’m not sure if I did the right thing so soon, hay. Lol. Hindi ko trip masyado yung sobrang bagal eh, hindi kasi ako masyadong dalagang Pilipina yea, lol. 30s naman na kami, so oks na diretso na sa condo ang bonding. Nag-oovernight siya madalas sa'kin. Kasi naman I’m at a stage also where I’m not really looking for a relationship yet. Pero hindi naman din ako naglalaro. Not into flings, sayang oras at effort. Nga lang it’s like there’s this implicit pressure when you’re in a relationship, your goals have to align with your partner’s, because of course what’s the point of having a partner if you still have to prioritize more your own goals? I still have so much to work on within myself, and I’m not proud of myself yet. It’s hard to be a girlfriend when you still have a lot of unresolved issues within yourself, your career and your life in general. But maybe I’m setting myself up for disaster? Idk. I think I’m really just looking for something light and easy. Alam mo yun, yung may mutual understanding, attracted sa isa't isa, being on the same page and journeying together to work on ourselves, yung magaan lang talaga. Yung gets niyo yung isa't isa

I saw his cute gestures, mga bagay na sobrang na-appreciate ko. Pinagluluto niya ako kahit wala pa siyang tulog at mahilig siyang mag-alok ng mga bagay kahit hindi pa siya sigurado kung kaya niya tulad ng mga salitang “Dalhan kita”, “Bilhan kita niyan”, “Mag-out of town tayo” or “Japan tayo next year?” Those kinds of thoughts get to me. I know there are things he can’t give right away, but for me, important yung at least naiisip na yun o kaya yung willingness to do it o kaya sana yung mapaglalaanan din niya. My top love language is gift-giving. It doesn’t mean I’m materialistic, but I really appreciate someone who’s willing to spend for me. Ladies, you get it. There’s something about that masculine effort, the ability to provide or at least the goal to be able to provide, that feels very different. Nakakababae sobra. Gustung-gusto ko yun. I’m a strong, independent woman naman, I pay for my bills and expenses, gusto ko rin nagreregalo at nanlilibre sa partner, but it feels so nice to be pampered as well. Parang he was pretty generous at first naman. I felt happy with the simple things he did for me. It felt like he understood my needs. (Besides that, importante pa rin sa'kin yung other 4 love languages. For me, it’s important to receive all those 5 love languages, because I’m naturally a giver. It doesn’t feel like a chore to me. And I want a partner who's also a giver)

Then I started to notice how different he was when he was stressed or tired. And that’s when you see someone’s true nature, right? He wasn’t like that during the first few weeks. Suddenly, he started pointing out my flaws in my looks, and it really stung. Di ako mahilig mag-point out ng flaws lalo sa itsura. Before, he was always giving me compliments, appreciating who I am as a person. May mga bagay na sinasabi naman siya in passing sa looks ko na compliment naman dati, pero alam ko hindi siya into words of affirmation. Pero ngayon, parang puro imperfections na lang yung nakikita niya sa’kin

Pero ito na nga ang turning point. We had an argument last time. Twice, siya yung nag-provoke. I tried to stay calm and handle it lightly, I wanted to be the mature one in the situation. Pero napansin ko parang naging mabigat yung mga bagay. Mabilis pala siyang mag-react over small things. Parang hindi niya kayang mag-move on agad. I told him I wanted things to stay light and happy, na ayoko ng mabigat agad, kasi parang too soon for that. Then, I suggested maybe it was best if we stopped dating. I felt like we didn’t align on how we handle things. It hurt me that he just agreed, without even trying to convince me to stay. Ako pa yung lumapit sa kanya at nagbago ng isip in the end. I wasn't trying to be pabebe, but if I saw sincere effort, I would have reconsidered. There's still a tiny part of me I wanted him to at least try

A week later, things seemed to go back to normal. I became sweeter, he seemed okay too. We joked around, had our usual playful banter. We still spent time together during the week. Pero a few days after, something shifted. He started acting rude out of nowhere. It felt like he became too comfortable parang inisip niya na okay lang basta hindi na siya careful sa words niya. So ayun I thought we were on the same page, same vibe. But suddenly, I felt like I couldn’t be my usual playful self anymore. I had to hold back my jokes kasi mabilis siyang mainis, either sa akin or sa mga bagay na nangyayari sa paligid. Mabilis siyang mairita pala, hindi ko trip yun, kasi hindi chill kasama. Parang ang bigat. Tas maya't maya nag-iiba yung mood, hindi ko matantsa. Dahil ba parang nakuha na niya ako in a way, ganun ba yun? Hay, ewan ko or ganun lang pala talaga siya eh nuh

Last Saturday, things got worse. The way he treated me felt off. He was really rude, the way he spoke to me, his attitude, it didn’t feel like I was special to him. We were in a coffee shop, I was trying to hold his hand, biglang sinabi niya ""nagwo-work ako, ano ba"". Non-verbatim, pero ganyan. Ang kupal lang. It's not hindi kami nagho-hold hands minsan, sa Grab or sa condo ko, pero gets kung ayaw niya in public he could have said it nicely or Idk ang sweet kaya nun yung random hahawakan yung kamay. Ano bang masama dun. Hindi naman ako OA rin nun, di naman din ako ok sa PDA, so alam ko naman kung pa'no gawin. Tapos ayun ganun ulit siya, maya't maya iba yung mood. Hindi ko matantsa. Medyo kupal magsalita. Gets ko yung biro, pero he's been rude talaga. Parang hindi na rin siya ganun ka-gentleman. Di ko pinahalata it affected me during that day, coz I know he's stressed and walang tulog. And ako kasi talaga yung taong mas pinipili yung peace. Ayoko kasi ng away. Gusto ko lang kasi mag-bond with him eh. Although napansin niya, medyo napapatahimik ako minsan, kasi I was just trying to stay cool. Hinatid naman niya ako sa condo that Saturday night though, but I cried when I got home. I didn’t understand it. For 2 days, I was crying. Kasi I thought I liked him. Actually, I do. I thought things were going well between us. Everything felt right. We had so many similarities, became really close, and got attached quickly. Then suddenly, all of this happened. I felt so sad. Sayang

The next day, I decided to stop talking to him. I told him na hindi ko nagugustuhan mga ginagawa niya, but only a little. Sabi ko hibernate muna ako 1 week. Then he apologized like maybe 3-4x sa chat. Baka mag-usap kami next week after my hibernation, and I feel like I just wanna say na maybe I'd focus muna on myself talaga, yun din naman yung goal ko dapat, nag-violate lang ako. Baka yun din yung sinasabi ng universe sa'kin. I figured he wouldn’t do anything to make me feel better anyway

Wew, ito na naman yung feeling na nararamdaman ko sa dati kong mga naka-date at sa mga ibang ex ko. It's like I'm being treated as a doormat again

Hi, 

My boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 6 months now. Last couple of months he has been fantastic, always there for me, we have fun together and I feel we both cherish each other equally. I am in love like never before. 

However, 6 months before we started dating he had asked out of one of his coworkers, they went on a date and then the girl didn’t show interest so that was it but then they ended up becoming work besties. He took me to meet his coworkers and was excited for me to meet this coworker bestie. The said coworker made her best efforts to stay as far from me that night and made minimal contact when all his other coworkers were super nice to me and wanted to get to know me. After the night ended my boyfriend felt that his coworkers behavior was off and said he wasn’t happy about it. I’m quite extroverted and make friends with most people easy - I had tried to make effort to get to know her because I thought she was important to my boyfriend but she literally stepped away when I was trying to hold a convo with her and gave poor replies. She’s pretty chatty and was talking to everyone so it’s not a shy personality issue. I suspect she either likes him or is jealous now that he has a partner. 

A couple months pass and my boyfriend took me to another one of his company events, I didn’t attempt to speak with this girl and we didnt even say hi to each other this time . She ran past us and waved, mainly only looking at my bf, After this, I told my boyfriend I was uneasy with the dynamic he has with work bestie who has been clearly disrespectful to me on two different occasions. He assured me he would distance himself from her. 

A couple months into the future now, I’ve been feeling more and more uncomfortable as I see him messaging her on teams and other platforms all the time. And today I committed the sin of looking at their teams chat log. Turns out they plan days they go to office, morning coffee runs and she usually signs him up to attend events with her. I found chats which to me are full of banter and borderline flirting.  I spoke about this with my boyfriend and explained why I felt uneasy. 

I don’t understand how someone (my bf) could be so comfortable and close to someone who was disrespectful to me. After seeing this, my trust in my boyfriend is now tainted and I don’t know if I want to continue with this relationship since this is the second time he has disappointed me after assuring me he was maintaining clear boundaries with this girl. My boyfriend has told me he wants to marry me and has bought me a promise ring too. He has been super helpful with recent events and usually caters to all my other needs. 

I don’t know how to shake off this uneasy feeling with him and this girl. He’s promised he’ll cut down contact so it’s just a professional relationship but I just don’t know if I trust him anymore and that he will cut off contact enough to respect my boundaries which I have communicated already. I don’t think I want to be in a relationship where I have to explain how to maintain clear boundaries with coworkers. Like I’d rather be single than teach someone how to be respectful towards me. Now I’m doubting if my boyfriend has any feelings for this girl too. Not sure if I should stay or move on. ",1,1734503311.0,relationship_advice,5,0.99,False

A couple of weeks ago, I (M28) approached an older woman (late 30s/early 40s) at Target, struck up a conversation, and ended up getting her Instagram. Later that night, we had a voice call on Instagram that lasted about an hour, and things seemed to be going well. We made plans to meet up, but the night before she sent me this message:

Morning thank you for you invite, right now I’m not ready to date or go out I need to concentrate on my son. I hope you can understand best of luck ❤️

So I respected her decision but tried a little convincing, saying that I wasn't looking for anything serious. She replied saying:

""I got pregnant with my son when I was broken up with my boyfriend from a guy I had only dated a few times when I was free. I do see my ex-boyfriend when I have available free time here and there, but idk if he would ever forgive me. We are both still in a working process. Sorry.""

After she sent that, I just respected her space and stopped reaching out. I figured that was the end of it.

Fast forward to about a week and a half later, she randomly texts me saying, “Hello, how are you?” Then she calls me, and we end up talking. During the conversation, we end up making plans to meet for coffee tomorrow.

I’m a bit conflicted here. On one hand, I’m open to seeing where this goes. On the other hand, her situation seems pretty complicated. She’s still somewhat involved with her ex, and there’s obviously a lot going on in her life.

What’s your read on this? Do you think she is now open to something casual with me?

Thanks in advance!

I’m a 33-year-old man based in the beautiful Seattle/Puget Sound area, looking for someone who’s not only kind and adventurous but also shares my passions. I’d love to start off slow and get to know someone whose interests align with mine—someone who’s down for impromptu getaways and finding joy in the simple moments.

Photography and motorcycling are huge parts of my life. I spend a lot of time exploring the world through a camera lens and from the seat of my bike. I dream of finding a partner who would enjoy a leisurely ride over mountain passes, soaking in the scenery, and stopping for photos of breathtaking landscapes. And if motorcycling isn’t your thing, no worries—road trips in the car with great conversation, cozy diners, and discovering hidden gems are just as special to me.

If your idea of fun includes chasing golden-hour sunsets, savoring roadside pie, and creating unforgettable memories, let’s connect. I’m looking for someone who values shared experiences, whether it’s exploring new places or appreciating the beauty of the everyday.

Let’s take it one adventure at a time and see where the road leads us. Tell me about your favorite scenic spot or a place you’ve always wanted to explore—I’d love to hear about it.

\-driving from airport (15 minutes) i see about 30 amazon trucks. we get stuck behind this huge robotic looking one that is blocking our entire narrow street. turns out it is driving to my mom's house to deliver her a single tiny tube of lip gloss.

\-in the house now there is an amazon camera or microphone device in practically every room. i want to turn on npr or something but i can't because i refuse to interact with this thing in the kitchen where the FM radio used to be that is literally displaying ads for more completely unnecessary products in between pictures of me and my siblings/stepsiblings as children. 2 more amazon trucks come to the house that day, each with another tiny item.

\-i bought my sister some nice coffee beans from a roaster i like. she says she and her roommates can't use them because they only make coffee with their machine that they have to buy certain pods for.

\-my mom's house is chock full of trader joe's processed food (almond flour tortillas, gluten free cookie mixes (no one in the house is gluten free), moroccan sun dried fish heads or whatever). if we eat a meal it's takeout, otherwise people stand in the kitchen eating ""healthy/natural"" snack food.

\-it's 45 degrees out. i walk into my dad's apartment and he has the air conditioning running and the windows closed. no one seems to see anything unusual about this.

\-so much of the appliances, furniture and decor in people's homes here just has this mass produced sheen to it. really sad because i feel like my family members had pretty good taste at one point but now the algorithms have convinced them to replace everything with cheap crap that they will have to replace with more tacky amazon stuff in a few years when it wears out.

it's truly a cursed way to live. just breaks my heart because when people waste their paycheck on shit like Trader Joe's Swedish Banana Bread Mix or Zimbabwean Chocolate Covered Oreos or whatever, they are not only giving up health and money but also denying themselves the pleasure of making banana bread from scratch, which would add all of 5 minutes to the process. something that used to and should still be fun (mixing sugar and flour together) becomes yet another thing we're dependent on corporations for.

grinding coffee beans and pouring boiling water over them is the best part of my day, and i can't imagine giving that away to overpriced pods and a machine full of microplastics.",40,1734502972.0,rs_x,14,0.95,False

1hgvi2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1hgvi2j/march_watchtower_highlights/,March Watchtower Highlights,"I haven't done one of these in a little while, but the March Watchtower has a whole lot of stuff in it that really stood out to me. So if you're curious about what the org is currently teaching and what it may indicate, here are my highlights:

#Study Article 9

> **Paragraph 6** If you have doubts about what you have learned, face them by doing research in our publications. Doubts can be overcome with “accurate knowledge.”

In my experience, researching my doubts in the publications and seeing the lack of answers and the inconsistencies and outright lies was what woke me up over time.

> **Paragraph 7** At a time when many Jews viewed Christians as apostates, Saul furiously persecuted them. He wrongly thought that he was doing God’s will.

I'd like to think that this might give Witnesses pause before labelling sincere people as apostates, especially if it was pointed out to them.

> **Paragraph 10** When Anna was 12 years old, she asked her father for approval to get baptized. He wanted to know if it was her personal decision or if she was being pressured by someone. She responded, “I love Jehovah.” Her father agreed to her baptism.

They are still encouraging child baptisms.

> **Paragraph 14** Tsuyoshi, from Japan, had to make a change in his employment in order to qualify for baptism. He was the assistant to the headmaster of the Ikenobo school of flower arrangement. When the headmaster was unable to attend funerals, Tsuyoshi often represented him in Buddhist rituals. However, when Tsuyoshi learned the truth about death, this practice became an obstacle to baptism. He made a personal decision not to share in Buddhist rites.

It's clear that he wasn't allowed to get baptized because the organization considered his employment to be ""interfaith"". But they also frame the change he made as a ""personal decision"". That decision was not personal, it was made for him by the organization and he wasn't allowed to be baptized without making it. And now he is unable to ever reverse his ""personal decision"" without being shunned, unless the governing body changes their policy about that particular line of employment one day.

> **Paragraph 16** Those in Corinth who accepted the good news about Christ were able to abandon such habits and practices as drunkenness, thievery, and homosexuality.

Interesting that they just happen to always pick on homosexuals, and not ""greedy people, revilers, or extortioners"". Also every modern definition of homosexuality is just being attracted to the same sex. It is not an action or a practice. The organization has admitted in recent years that some Witnesses are attracted to the same sex, and that never changes. It is just ""acting on that attraction"" they object to. So besides being bigoted it's also written wrong.

#Study Article 10

> **Paragraph 8** Jesus urged his followers to put the Kingdom first in their life. (Matt. 6:33) With that in mind, a publisher in your congregation might decide to undertake some form of full-time service. Rather than suggest that he be kind to himself, we should speak positively about that worthy endeavor and offer our support.

That sounds a little desperate. Like they're hearing reports of people being talked out of sacrificing the best years of their life to the org, and they're trying to stamp that out.

#Study Article 11

> **Paragraph 1** One thing that sets Jehovah’s servants apart from imitation Christians is their zeal for the ministry.

Driving around for an hour doing ""calls"" and then hanging out at a coffee shop is not zeal. The organization has spent 150 years capitalizing on the ""zeal"" that ""imitation Christians"" showed for the first 1,800 years as they spread Christianity around the globe before JWs ever appeared on the scene. That's why the vast majority of their growth has always been in countries where ""Christendom"" already had an established presence. But in Muslim countries and secular places like China, they got nothing.

> **Paragraph 7** Even if people do not respond now, they may have an opportunity to do so before the end of the great tribulation. What we say to them now may well be what moves them to respond in the future. But that can only happen if we keep on preaching.

This is a line they have been using ever since last year's ""last minute repentance"" Annual Meeting. They know that by saying God is gong to judge hearts, including *billions* of people who have never even heard of Jehovah's Witnesses, the ministry is pointless. So they make this claim and provide *zero* scriptural support with it to try and fool Witnesses into thinking the ministry still has a purpose.

> **Paragraph 8** Jesus let what he knew influence how he used his time. As a result, he preached with zeal in order to finish the work he had been given to do.

Much of this article is talking about how much Jesus preached. But the interesting thing is that when you think about it, his ministry was actually pretty pointless. According to the book of Acts, the spread of Christianity was due mainly to the 11 Apostles starting in Jerusalem, and with the help of the Holy Spirit it was spread throughout the Roman Empire. But besides having those close followers who followed him to Jerusalem, the preaching Jesus did in Galilee feels pretty unimportant and incidental.

> **Paragraph 9** We perceive how the rivalry between the Anglo-American World Power and Russia and its allies fulfills the prophecy about the king of the south and the king of the north “in the time of the end.” (Dan. 11:40) We also understand that the Anglo-American World Power is represented by the feet of the image described at Daniel 2:43-45. We are convinced that as the prophecy indicates, soon​—very soon—​God’s Kingdom will destroy human governments.

This paragraph uses ""our"", ""us"" and ""we"" no less than nine times. They are pushing a belief on their followers to adopt belief in their convoluted and ever-changing interpretations of obscure prophecies to claim with certainty they were projecting over 2000 years into the future (and skipping most of those centuries). And they're still pushing the ""soon, very soon"" line that was used a couple months ago in the Broadcast. This claim is sharply contrasted later in Study Article 13.

> **Paragraph 12** He instructed them not to force their message on those who did not want to listen. (Luke 10:10, 11) And he told them to flee if they were persecuted. (Matt. 10:23) Although Jesus was zealous and trusted in Jehovah, he did not needlessly expose himself to danger.​—John 11:53, 54.

Jesus got himself executed by causing a scene at the temple. Any preaching, going around knocking on people's doors and sharing an ""unpopular message"" exposes people to danger. So ""needlessly"" is a loaded word that they have no interest in actually explaining.

In paragraph 14 they include a picture of a brother Witnessing informally at a gas station. I guess the org thinks that kind of thing doesn't ""needlessly expose somebody to danger"". But for me, it brings to mind the Lillelid family. 34 year old Vidar decided to ""informally witness"" to a group of youths at a Tennessee gas station on his way home from a Convention in 1997. Vidar, his wife Delfina, their six year old daughter Tabitha and their two year old son Peter were all abducted as a result. They were all lined up against a ditch and shot repeatedly. Peter was the only one who survived the ordeal, but left with lifelong disabilities. I guess the swooping angels were all too busy directing Witnesses to people praying for help, and missed protecting that innocent family who were just following the direction they were given at the Convention.

> **Paragraph 16** Jesus taught his disciples to keep a positive view of their message, which would encourage them to maintain their zeal ... Jesus used a mustard grain to teach that the Kingdom message would expand in an amazing way and have unstoppable growth.

RemindMe! - 5 years. Because the growth of the org has slowed significantly in the past few years, and they are making significant changes to try and keep it going. But I doubt that the positive growth will continue much longer. And Witnesses are seeing the problems, they feel the ministry dying a slow death, which is why this article is all about trying to shore up a ""positive view"" of the ministry. Because the rank and file do not view the ministry positively.

#Study Article 12

> **Paragraphs 7 & 8** Note how Javier, a brother in South America, saw the need to walk by faith. He says: “I had applied for a prestigious job that would double my salary and provide considerable personal satisfaction.” However, Javier had the deep desire to pioneer ... Yes, Javier rejected the offer. Two weeks later, he started pioneering. And later that year, he found a part-time job.

That's yet another sad example of people being encouraged to sabotage their lives, and being cheered on for doing so. I hope poor Javier never wakes up and realizes what he gave up.

> **Paragraph 9** Consider the experience of Trésor, from Congo. He relates: “My new job was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I was earning triple what I previously earned, and I was well-respected.” However, Trésor regularly missed meetings because of working overtime. He was also pressured to cover up dishonest activities ... He says: “Habakkuk 3:17-19 helped me to understand that even if I lost my income, Jehovah would somehow take care of me. So I resigned.” ... A year later, Jehovah helped me find a stable job that allows me to live modestly and have more time for Christian activities.

And another. It's just so sad. And there is nothing in the Bible that encourages people to do that.

> **Paragraph 12** Rosa, a pioneer in Colombia. Her work brought her into repeated contact with a non-Witness man who began to show interest in her. Rosa was attracted to him. She says: “He seemed like a very good man. He volunteered in his community and had a healthy lifestyle. I liked how he treated me. He had what I wanted in a husband except he was not a Witness.” She continues: “It was difficult to say no to him because it was something that I wanted emotionally.

Even more examples of Witnesses being commended for passing up every opportunity to improve their miserable lives.  Good thing she avoided Satan's temptation, so she can just wait for Fabio in the paradise instead.

> **Paragraph 13** We often receive theocratic direction​—from our local elders, the circuit overseer, the branch office, or the Governing Body—​that guides us in our worship. But what if on occasion we cannot understand the reason for the direction we receive? We may see only the negative effects that the direction could have on us. We may even begin to focus on the imperfections of the brothers who gave the direction.

The organization keeps pushing the ""obey the direction even if it doesn't make sense"" angle, which is truly frightening. What if one day they said ""now is the time to max out your credit cards and give everything to us""? 

> **Paragraph 14** When we walk by faith, we trust that Jehovah is in control and that he knows our circumstances. As a result, we are quick to obey, and we do so with a positive attitude.

It probably goes without saying, but this is all so very culty.

> **Paragraph 15** For a number of years, Quechua-speaking brothers and sisters searched for those who spoke Quechua in the territory. However, in order to comply with government regulations, adjustments were made in the method of reaching people.

This is a really strange couple of paragraphs, and I wonder what kind of regulations they are referring to. But the gist of it is that the government stepped in and told them what they could and couldn't do and now their preaching is even *more* effective! So maybe the lesson is the org shouldn't be trying to resist Norway so hard?

#Study Article 13

> **Paragraph 8** Jehovah soon provided meat; the people had an abundant supply of quail. The Israelites, however, did not thank God for this miracle. Rather, many were overcome with greed. Working around the clock, they collected a vast quantity of quail. Jehovah was furious with those “who showed selfish craving,” and he punished them.

This account has always felt confusing and frustrating. These people wanted meat, God gave them meat. In *any other context*, working ""around the clock"" is held up as an example of diligence. But this time Jehovah said ""fooled you, you worked *too* hard"". The article obscures the truth by saying that Jehovah ""punished them"", but the scripture says he ""began striking the people with a great slaughter"". It's psychotic, abusive behaviour. 

> **Paragraph 13** Our trust in Jehovah’s hand could also be tested as we consider what our situation might be like when we grow older. The Bible encourages us to work hard so that we can care for our future material needs. (Prov. 6:6-11) It is reasonable, as our means allow, to set something aside for the future.

I wrote a [separate post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/s/J736FHPpCp) about this paragraph, but to me it's the most significant statement in a 2025 Watchtower so far. Thanks to u/Fresh_Problem5783 for [first drawing attention](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/s/jDToiAM7sl) to this point. The short version is that the org is finally tacitly admitting to their followers that they might want to start saving for retirement. But that rings pretty hollow after spending 150 years stringing their followers along with promises of the end coming really *really* soon.",10,1734502668.0,exjw,6,1.0,False
