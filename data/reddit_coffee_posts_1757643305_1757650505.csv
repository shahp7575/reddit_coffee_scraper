I took Leo to the vet today after some issues with poop getting stuck to his bottom and I learned a lot. Apparently my rescue bun is older than I thought, approx 3-6 yrs, and has arthritis.

I’ve had Leo for nearly a year now, many of you have followed his story. I feel terrible, like how could I have missed the signs? He’s slowed down a lot since I brought him home, gradually, not all at once, but I just thought he’d become lazy and spoiled. Instead of hopping on and off the couch like he used to, for a couple months now he head butts me to help him instead. He stays in his room a lot, has pretty much stopped doing his daily laps around the coffee table. I feel so bad!

Anyways, vet sent us home with some meloxicam to try. If anyone has any tips on how to help him I’d greatly appreciate it.

1netib9,https://i.redd.it/bpm9qzk1snof1.jpeg,Furthermore . . .,"So far, here’s what I know about myself:

- Female
- Born in November 1991
- 64 kilos heavy
- 5’0 short
- Currently living at Quezon City
- Works at an auditing firm as senior manager

I have the tendency to move away from the crowd, literally and figuratively. If I have a choice, I will not attend parties or functions. If I have a choice, I’d choose only 2 friends to travel with instead of 10 or 12. Every fiber of my being rejects the idea of watching the same mainstream movie that my neighbor watches. I like finding things that I can consider mine. I like gatekeeping things. I believe people ruin things. I hate that people discovered Money Heist and Lucifer during the pandemic because I think the showrunners made them about the fans instead of sticking to the story. And so I stopped watching the later seasons.

I love About Time and Past Lives. They tell love and romance uniquely. I love rom-coms. I love coming-of-age films. I love Edge of Seventeen as much as The Perks of Being a Wallflower. I love reading John Grisham novels, and after finishing The Street Lawyer it solidified my goal to build a life that is simple and meaningful. I love stumbling into good music when I watch films. My most recent find is Strip Me by Natasha Bedingfield. It feels like it is my discovery, something I can call mine. I loved it when I heard Mystery of Love by Sufjan Stevens in the film Call Me By Your Name. To Leave Something Behind by Sean Rowe is from The Accountant, IIRC.

I love eating the same food for a whole month even though I know I’ll get sick of it after all the cravings. That’s what happened with tuna sandwiches, Yabu, samgyup, and many more. I can’t drink coffee continuously every day because at some point (maybe after day 3 or 4) it will mess up my sleep schedule.

I love talking with people about things they love. I love listening to people talk about their crafts. I love the process of discovering one’s personality—what ticks them off, what makes them smile, and what makes them furious.

I love when people make me feel seen and loved without me asking for it.

Anyway, I am rambling now. These are the things I love, which means the opposites are things I refuse to do or try.

Bob's logic on why chapstick is a container is because ""it's never seen outside of a container"". That logic immediately means that all beverages are containers. Coffee is a container. Dr. Pepper is a container. 

It also is a paradox of itself, because if chapstick is a container, and it's never seen outside of a container, what is chapstick's container when chapstick is already a container?

When I think of container, I think of an item that is used to contain stuff within itself. Chapstick does not fit that description.

I just said ""you're a big boy.""

Her mouth dropped again and she grabbed my wrist and said ""come with me, I need to talk to you.""

I instinctively punched her in the back of the head and she fell to the ground (she flew pretty far from the punch so I assume I either knocked her out or her pain tolerance didn't exactly match her attitude).

[Original Post](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/61z5p2/crazy_coworker_26f_is_texting_me_24m_telling_me/)  **March 28, 2017**

First of all, sorry english is not my first language.

So, it is as the title says.

We work at the same office, she sits on the desk across from mine and is married as well as I'm, and recently we've been talking more with each other, but nothing out of the ordinary. (I have a good relationship with pretty much everyone here, except for Carl - fuck you Carl and your credit stealing habits!)

Just cheap chat about regular stuff (how was the weekend, look this funny video, what do you think about this, that, etc).

Then she started texting telling me that she is surprised about how easy is to talk to me and how she enjoys how the conversation just flows. And I was ""cool, me too, you're nice.""

Last week I left my car at the Auto Repair, since the brake started to make a funny noise, and since she lives 2 blocks away from where I live, I asked for a ride home.

We are on traffic going home, talking about regular stuff, then she brings the subject again about how nice our convesations have been, and I agree. I have plenty female friends, so this is not uncommon for me.

Then she starts talking about how interesting is that we have some different opinions about stuff but we get along well anyways, and I'm ""yeah, sure"".

This is when I noticed things got fuckin' weird. She then says she started looking at me differently, and that she's attracted by me and put her hand on my tight.

I thanked her and told she's nice and good-looking, but we're just collegues, we're both married, I respect her but I'm not interested, so no way anything is going to happen.

The rest of the ride was an awkward silence.

When I got home, she kept texting me about how we're getting along so well and stuff, how she is not in the best moment in her marriage, etc. Then I received a lot of instagram notifications of her mass-liking my photos.

I replied the texts trying not to be rude, saying that maybe she should use her energy and time to resolve the problems she is having at home instead of... this. At this point I think she is crazy and the best way to avoid any problems is to just dismiss the crazy shit she is saying and keep it cool and distant, since we work together in a 55 people company.

She says it's not just physical attraction, and that she's jealous and can't stand see my wife's posts on instagram with me. Red alert!

And now she wants to meet me after work or during the lunch brake out of the office, to talk about things.

I haven't told any of this to my wife yet, and I was not planning to do so, since she is way too stressed out recently with her job and some problems with her parents.

So I'd like to know from the All-Might & All-Knowing Reddit how:

* To avoid this crazy lady getting more crazy and try cause problems at work and with my marriage?

* Wives of reddit, if you were my wife, would you like me to tell you what's happening or just deal with it?

My plan so far is to let her know AGAIN that I'm not interested, just play it cool and dismiss what she is saying, slowly decreasing the number of interaction we have until everything fades into a regular coworker stuff.

**tl;dr:** crazy married female collegue wants me, but I'm just want her to stop being crazy. How to do that? Should I tell my wife (stressed about other stuff) what's going on or just deal with it?

[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/64zdvu/update_crazy_coworker_26f_is_texting_me_24m/)  **Apr 12, 2017 (2 weeks later)**

Sorry it took so long to update you!

First of all, thanks for all the advice. Since it was the first time this happened to me in such a blunt way, I tried to handle it the best I could, but I was kind of lost about what to do. So thanks again, your advices really helped me.

Following your advices, I got home yesterday, asked my wife to sit down and told her what was going on. I showed her all the messages and explained to her in details what happened.

She was really concerned, didn't get mad or anything, she was just worried that - using her words -, ""that bitch would ruin your carreer and stress you out"".

So I told her I would talk to my boss and the HR next day, and so I did.

I arrived earlier, scheduled the meeting with HR and my boss (he went pale went I told him I'd like to talk with him and HR together - later he said he thought I would quit, haha!).

I sat down with them, asked them to be prepared for a mexican soap opera, and them showed them all the messages and explain to them all that happened.

I told them I'd like her to be moved to another desk, and that I trusted them to discipline her, so she would stop harassing me.

They listen very quietly, nodding between the sentences and doing quick question when in doubt.

After I finished telling my tale they said they would call her in to talk and address the subject, and that I could rest assured they would take all reasonable measures.

I went back to my desk, got to work (I was going on a business trip to Ciudad de Mexico following week, so I'm pretty busy), then I heard the BSCC phone (short for bat-shit-crazy-coworker) ring. She looked at me with suspicious on her eyes when she got up and went to talk to the HR, I tried to avoid eye contact and didn't express anything.

One hour later she comes back crying, get her purse and leave.

Everybody in the office was ""wtf just happened?"". My boss then call me into his office and told me what happened.

They told her I told them what was going on, then she made a whole dramatic shit show, telling she was in love with me and was fighting for what she thought was right, etc etc etc.

My boss and the HR person dismissed her silly arguments and told her she would need to keep things professional and move to another desk, otherwise they would have rescind the work contract.

And she prefered to get fired, so from now on she no longer works with me.
It has been 2 weeks and so far nothing related to the subject happened, so I guess my life is back the way I like it: just peace and quiet.

So, thanks again for all advices! I think my thoughts were kind of clouded by this shit, you guys made me think clearly, so thanks!

**tl;dr:** Told my wife, she was awesome. Told boss and HR, they were awesome. Crazy bitch was fired, which is awesome. I have my life back: peace and quiet.

**siasin**

>> This!

>> OP, if possible have your boss and HR give you something in writing about what happened in case you need it for documentation purposes with the authorities. You might also want to write out your own quick log of everything that happened and when while it is still fresh in your mind. Check into what your legal options might be just in case.

Following your comments here I wrote my logs, made a back up of all the messages and requested the HR for a formal letter explaining what happened.

**ATHIESTAVENGER**

**OOP**

>>>>> Well, I'm also known for not being very perceptive, and I never paid much attention to her, so it can be my fault on this point.

**Edit:** I know this subreddt only allow one update, and I waited 15 days to post this, but this is important so I guess an Edit won't hurt anyone. Mods, please let me know if this is not cool.

Just got a call from her husband. Apparently she was crying all weekend and told him on monday why she was fired.

He told her didn't buy her version of the facts, since the contradict herself in several points of her story.

He told her call the company to clarify what happened, and now was calling me just to make sure.

I told him everything and offered to show him the messages. We are going to meet in an hour in a coffee next to the office.

He sounded hurt, but very clear minded.

Just told my boss, HR and my wife that I'm going to meet him, and my boss offered to go with me.

Man, I'm surrounded by good people.

**Edit2:** Just came back from the meeting with her husband. It was all very quickly.

I arrived with my boss, he was waiting for me. I just showed him the messages in my phone, answer some questions about what happened, and that was it. He said he just wanted to be sure, 'cause she deleted all of her messages.

He said this was not the first time something like that happened and apologized for everything.

He said she was seeing a psychologist in the past, but she had stopped going recently.

I just said I didn't want nothing to do with it, that I came to meet him just to make clear I didn't want any of this to happen, wished him the best and left.

He just nodded and apologized again as I left.

I'm surprised with his reaction. Maybe he doesn't seem to be angry because they passed through something similar before, I don't know and really don't care. I'm just had enough drama and I'm glad this wasn't another one.

So, let's hope this is the end.

Thanks for your support and advice on this.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

(No More Text-on-Image Headaches!),"If you've ever tried to generate an image with text using current AI models, or even just edit text on an existing photo, you know the pain. Typos, weird fonts, text in all the wrong places, impossible to align... it's a nightmare. I got so fed up with these limitations that I decided to build a solution.

**So, what does it do?**

My tool uses a conversational interface to give you incredible precision over both your images and any text you want to put on them. Think of it like having a super-powered graphic designer you can just chat with.

Here's how it generally works:

1. **Start with an Image (Yours or Mine):** You can either upload an image you already have, or you can generate a brand new one using a detailed text prompt. Want a ""dark, moody background with a coffee mug and steam""? Just ask, and it'll create it.
2. **Edit Images with Simple Commands:** This is where the conversational magic truly begins. Want to ""move that coffee mug to the bottom right""? Done. Need to ""remove that watermark from the corner""? Poof, it's gone. No more fiddling with selection tools or cloning – just tell the AI what you want.
3. **Add Text with Unprecedented Control:** This is the game-changer.
   * **Draw a Box:** You physically draw a rectangle on the image where you want your text to appear. This tells the AI exactly where to focus.
   * **Speak Your Text & Style:** Then, you simply tell the AI what words to put there, and how you want them to look. ""Add the words 'Daily Grind Cafe' in a bold, white, sans-serif font, centered in that box."" The AI understands and places the text perfectly.
   * **Refine Iteratively:** Want to change the font to Times New Roman? Or make the main headline yellow and the prices green? You just keep chatting with it, and the AI makes the adjustments in real-time. It handles complex layouts too, like creating a neatly formatted menu or a list, just from your conversational input.
4. **Download Your Masterpiece:** Once everything looks perfect, you can download your image in high quality (PNG, PDF, etc.) ready for whatever you need it for.

I don't like the idea of eating sugary snacks like protein bars which are not a part of my regular eating habits. ,1,1757649040.0,Zepbound,1,1.0,False
1net6j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1net6j9/my_roommate_wants_to_do_things_to_me/,My roommate wants to do things to me,"I moved to LA on a whim. I had never let go of my childhood dream of becoming an actor and thought, if I was ever going to make it, it was now or never. Stupid decision. But anyway, that’s not the point of the story.

LA is expensive as hell. I didn’t have a job yet and only $500 in my bank account. How was I going to find a place to stay? It should have been impossible, but hey, I got lucky (or so I thought): I replied to a post in a Facebook group—a UCLA student was looking for a roommate for their three-bedroom apartment. I sent her an honest message about my situation and, miraculously, Joanna liked me. In hindsight, she understood that only a desperate bum like me would be willing to stay in that real-life haunted house, but back then, I just thought she liked me.

To be fair, I hadn’t gone on Craigslist offering myself up to random crazies… it was a legit Facebook group, a legit Facebook post, and a legit Facebook person with hundreds of friends, photos, etc.

The apartment was super cute and it sat right in the middle of Brentwood, one of the nicest areas of LA. Rent: $400/month, utilities included. Man, I don’t know what I was thinking. I guess I was so naïve to the harsh realities of this city that I believed I had charmed my way into a deal too-good-to-be-true-but-actually-true.

I would share the apartment with Joanna, a third-year med student at UCLA, and Shruti, a computer technician who had recently immigrated from India. Joanna was super friendly and seemed to have a good head on her shoulders. We hit it off right away. Shruti, on the other hand, was… weird? The thing is, I didn’t actually see Shruti.

The day I moved in, Joanna knocked on Shruti’s door to introduce me. There was no response from the other side, but Joanna kept standing there, waiting.

“Maybe she’s not in,” I said.

“She is in. She is always in,” was Joanna’s ominous response.

Sure enough, after a few minutes, Shruti cracked the door open—just a couple of inches. She was shrouded in darkness, and a pungent odor wafted out of the opening. It smelled like food and stale air. I couldn’t make out Shruti’s features—only the whites of her eyes.

“Hey Shruti,” Joanna chirped, unfazed. “This is our new roommate, Bradley.”

I waved awkwardly. The dark silhouette uttered a low grunt, then slammed the door in our faces. As we moved away, Joanna put her hand around my shoulders and whispered, “Don’t let it affect you. Shruti is a lone wolf, but she’s harmless.”

I was weirded out, but I shrugged it off. In that beautiful, clean, sun-bathed apartment, Shruti’s room was only a dark corner I could pretend not to see. Looking back now, the most terrifying thing about that place was exactly the fake serenity—the daily pretending that everything was just fine.

At first, I was excited about being in LA: the sun, the ocean, the palm trees, the Hollywood glamour… But LA is a distressing city, and it has a way of letting you know that very quickly—sun, ocean, palm trees, and Hollywood glamour notwithstanding. I got myself a frustrating retail job that paid like crap, and I signed up for an acting class full of self-absorbed individuals who dreamt of glory and fame. After a few days, I was already panicking about my total lack of significance in this world.

Thankfully, I got along well with Joanna. As a medical student, she kept herself far away from the entertainment madness. She was a grounded young woman on a mission, with a busy schedule and plenty of friends. In fact, I was a bit jealous of how fulfilled she seemed in her life. I also resented her for never introducing me to any of the smiling faces that sprinkled her social media pages. I thought she felt superior to me—and rightly so. She was a cool LA girl. I was a sorry wannabe actress from the middle of nowhere.

Despite my negative feelings, I was also grateful for her. She was a warm presence who welcomed me when I came home. The only person who gave me any attention, really. When we crossed paths in the living room, we would always sit and chat, forcing ourselves to ignore Shruti’s closed door and whatever was going on behind it.

After a couple of weeks living at the apartment, however, I did ask Joanna how it was possible that I had never seen Shruti. Did she ever come out of her bedroom?

Joanna shrugged. “Not really, at least not when people are around. She works remotely for some IT company.”

“Does she have any friends?”

Joanna burst out laughing. I started laughing too. Two mean girls making fun of their weird roommate. But deep down, I knew it wasn’t funny.

Not long after, things got scary.

Joanna had suggested we take a day trip to Big Bear Lake. We spent a wonderful day immersed in nature. I felt that Joanna and I finally connected on a deeper level. I opened up to her about how lonely I felt in LA. Joanna was very supportive—originally from Canada, she had moved to LA for her studies and had struggled to adjust to her new environment. So she understood. She was also more open about Shruti. According to her, Shruti had a severe mental illness. Joanna would have preferred a different roommate, but Shruti was an undocumented immigrant and Joanna didn’t want to ruin her life by throwing her out of the house. That made sense.

I went to sleep happy that night. I woke up terrified.

It was about 3 a.m. when I found myself awake in my bed, eyes wide open, dread worming its way through my body. It wasn’t the fear of a specific threat, but rather the intuition that something terrible, something depraved, was about to happen—I just didn’t know what. That’s when I heard a deep moan from the other side of the door, followed by the scratching of nails against the wood. I lay still, praying thunderously in my head that I had not forgotten to lock the door.

The sounds stopped. I kept staring at the door, shadows dancing across my eyes, until wakefulness and sleep merged into each other.

When I woke up again in the morning, I told myself I’d had a lucid nightmare. Or sleep paralysis. Whatever it’s called. But as I left the room, I saw a mark on the outside of my door—a half-circle drawn in a deep red color.

I tried to wipe it off, to no avail. You can imagine how unsettled I was. I spoke to Joanna about it right away. She wasn’t as surprised as I thought she would be. Instead, she lowered her eyes, embarrassed. “Well, as I said, Shruti has a severe mental illness. Sometimes she’ll come out of her room at night and do odd things... Just stay in your room and ignore it. You’ll be fine.”

I felt angry. Joanna should have told me about Shruti before I moved in. Clearly, this person had more serious issues than just being a recluse. At the same time, $400 a month for that apartment was an unbeatable deal. Finding another place to stay would be really hard, given the state of my finances. So I decided to stick with it—and lock my door every night.

For a few days, all was quiet. I was a little tense in the evening when I went to bed, but eventually, I slipped back into my usual routine. Joanna and I kept hanging out a lot, just the two of us, and I got over the anger I felt towards her. After all, she was also in a tough spot: if she had been too honest about Shruti, people would not have wanted to rent the room.

I had a big monologue performance coming up at acting school, which I was very nervous about. Joanna helped me prepare for it. I discovered she had excellent acting instincts. Thanks to her support, I felt confident in my own voice and the performance went down wonderfully. After class, a girl came up to me to congratulate me. It was pretty much the first proper conversation I’d had with someone at school.

As it turned out, Emma and I had a lot in common. She was also from a small town in the Midwest and eager to meet new people in LA. We decided we’d go on a hike together to the Hollywood sign.

That night, while we were eating dinner, I asked Joanna if she wanted to join us.

Joanna’s eyes shot up. “Join you and who?”

“Emma, this girl I met in class. I think you’ll love her.”

“But I thought I was your favorite person.”

Time stood still. What did she just say? I didn’t know how to respond. I held Joanna’s gaze, trying to gauge whether she was being serious or not. She looked dead serious, ruthless even… until she started to laugh. I laughed too, and we moved on to a different subject.

A little while later, we were cleaning up the kitchen together. I made a joke; she smiled. As I turned my back to her, I caught her reflection in the dark windowpane. Her expression had changed abruptly. She was staring at me from behind, her face contorted into a grimace of pure loathing. I swiveled around—and there she was, smiling again. The usual, lovely Joanna.

What a strange evening… Surely, my mind was playing tricks on me. Joanna was a friend. She wasn’t perfect, of course, and maybe a little jealous, but that only proved that she truly cared about me.

However, before going to sleep, I dragged the dresser (the heaviest piece of furniture in my room) against the door. Just to be safe. I ended up staying awake for hours, monitoring the door like a sentinel. Eventually, sleep overcame me. As I was roaming the shadowy halls of Morpheus, I heard a guttural moan. I did not know if it came from the real world or from the depths of my mind. And again, that blood-curdling nail scratching sound. I told myself to wake up—I needed to fight, defend my territory, protect myself! But I couldn’t. I was trapped in the fumes of dark dreams.

When I finally woke up, the sun had risen. It looked like an ordinary morning, with birds chirping and cars driving by. But I was drenched in a cold sweat. I shot from my bed and dragged the dresser away from the door. The first thing I saw were scratches all over the side of the dresser that had been against the door, as if someone had been pushing madly to get inside.

Even before I opened the door, I knew there would be a message for me on the other side. Remember that red half-circle that had appeared a couple of days earlier? During the night, the drawing had been extended into a huge, bleeding heart. Right in the middle of it was my name, “Bradley.”

At that point, I think I switched to survival mode. When I came across Joanna in the kitchen, I didn’t mention anything that had happened. I just wished her good morning. Yet, she was the Joanna I saw every morning, making coffee on the fly, her UCLA med student badge hanging around her neck. Her eyes bore into me with genuine concern. Despite my efforts to act casual, I was extremely tense, and she clocked it right away.

“Is everything okay?” she asked.

“Yeah, I just have a bit of a headache.”

“Awww. I’ll get you something from CVS before I come home tonight.”

She placed a hand on my arm. It felt cold and clammy, like a fish hanging on to my skin. Revulsion vibrated through me. So what did I do? I hugged her. I didn’t even think about it—my body moved of its own accord, the same way your hands shoot forward when you fall down. As I held her in my arms, I smelled her fruity perfume, the one she always wore—but also something else underneath it: a sour odor, harsher than the smell of sweat. It was the smell of fear.

When I let go of her, I saw a flash of suspicion glinting in her eyes.

I didn’t quite realize how stiff my body had been until Joanna shut the door behind her. I stood still for a few more minutes, listening to her steps bouncing down the stairs, her car turning on and driving away, and finally… silence. When I was sure she was gone, my muscles almost melted in relief.

Then my mind did a full U-turn. What was I going on about? Joanna had shown me nothing but kindness ever since I had gotten here. She was a great person by all measurable standards. If I had to make a list of my LA friends, hers would be the only name to come up. That Emma girl? I barely knew her. And if there was an insane person in this house, it was clearly Shruti.

I knocked forcefully on Shruti’s door, determined to confront her. She opened the door right away. I instinctively recoiled. Instead of hiding like last time, she showed herself fully: a bony figure with elongated limbs and huge eyes. *The eyes of a hunted animal hiding in a hole*, I thought.

I intended to say something along the lines of: \*“\*What do you want from me? Stop bothering me or else..!”

I couldn’t. My mouth went dry.

She spoke first. “Did you figure it out yet?”

“W-what do you mean?” I stammered.

“Come in.”

Shruti dived back into the semi-darkness of her stinky room, beckoning me to follow. My mind told me to get the hell away from there, but my feet decided to drag me forward. As my eyes adjusted to the low lighting, a realization hit me. This was just a room. It was messy, kind of dirty… but how many young people’s rooms look like that? There was actually nothing odd about it.

Then I turned around and saw it: the wall where the door was, the wall that separated the room from the rest of the apartment, was covered in red graffiti. They depicted eyes, their wide pupils burning through me.

I let out a small cry and was about to run away when Shruti put a hand on my shoulder. For some reason, it felt incredibly calming.

“Don’t worry, it’s for protection.”

“Protection from what?!” I cried out.

“From her.”

She handed me a stack of papers. I leafed through them rapidly. They all depicted the same thing: Joanna’s UCLA medical badge. Multiple iterations, some neat-looking, some wonky, where the Photoshopping was obvious.

“I searched the bin,” Shruti explained. “Med school is a new thing. Before that, she was in law school. Before that, she was a successful film producer. That one was harder to pull off.”

My head started spinning. “What’s the meaning of this?”

Shruti sighed. “Come look.”

She pulled up Joanna’s Instagram account on her laptop and flicked through the photos. Photos of Joanna with groups of friends on the UCLA campus, on Venice Beach, on Hollywood Walk of Fame… normal social media photos I had seen before but never thought much about.

“What do you notice?”

“What do I notice?”

“Observe the faces of the people in these photos.”

I looked closely and I did notice something. Their smiles looked either a little forced, or a little too wide, like they were making fun of something… and Joanna always stood slightly apart from the rest of the group.

“Well, they all seem a little… uncomfortable.”

“Right. Look again.”

She flicked through the photos, back and forth. It finally clicked. *Not a single face appeared twice*. They were all different people in every photo.

“Does she just…?”

“Yeah, she just goes up to people on the street and asks them to take pictures with her. Her whole life is fake. *She* is fake.”

A mix of emotions bubbled up inside me: shock, fear, anger, shame… Weirdly, shame was the one that rose to the top.

“Who is she?”

“I don’t know. I only know she is very dangerous.”

Shruti grabbed my wrist and held it tightly.

“Listen to me,” she said. “The only way to protect yourself from her is to give her nothing. That’s why I hide in here all day. If she senses that you are willing to be her friend, even in the slightest, she will eat you alive. She craves love, and she can never get enough of it.”

“Eat you alive? What do you mean?” I whined, trying to pull my wrist away from Shruti’s grip. She would not let go.

She shook her head, as if to indicate that she didn’t want to answer the question. “It is too late for you. You have already let her in. Way too much. The only thing you can do now is run.”

Her voice turned into a shriek. **“RUN!”**

She released my wrist and I bolted out of there. Her shrill cry resonated in my head like an explosion of needles. I threw my stuff haphazardly in a bag and got in my car. As I drove away, I thought I spotted a familiar face staring at me from a coffee shop near the apartment. I wasn’t sure of it, but for miles I kept feeling like someone was watching me.

Right now, I’m sitting on Emma’s couch. I told her my roommate was acting crazy and asked if I could crash at her place for a while. She said yes, but she didn’t seem too enthusiastic about it. More like she was too polite to say no. I’m afraid I’m going to overstay my welcome very quickly.

My bank account is in the red. I’m not sure where to go. I keep thinking about calling Joanna. At least I know she would pick up. She always does.

Then I push that thought away. The whole reason I escaped that apartment is her.

Did I really have to do that, though? What was I afraid of, really?

It’s like two people are arguing in my head.

Oh god. Joanna is calling me. Should I pick up?

I kind of want to.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1nesyzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreaticcancer/comments/1nesyzl/is_dairy_a_nogo_from_now_on/,Is dairy a no-go from now on?,"I (M, 48yo) was diagnosed back in September 2024 with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, inoperable and incurable due to involvement of arteries, veins, nerves etc.

My initial chemo treatments (folfirinox) left me with severe and ongoing pancolitis that has never really resolved - essentially my digestive system is now a bit stuffed and quite temperamental.

I've always been a HUGE fan of milk and dairy products - cheeses, ice cream, big old glasses of icy cold full cream milk, you name it. However over the past few months my husband and I have started noticing a lot more gut issues with me - primarily, more severe bouts of diarrhoea that last a few days at a time, are around a 7 on the old Bristol Chart (essentially nothing but water), and are incredibly painful. The diarrhoea doesn't really match up with any other factors or possible causes I don't think - I'm no longer undergoing chemo or other treatments. I'm also taking quite a lot of slow-release and PRN pain meds, which should have the opposite effect on my digestive system, but it doesn't seem to at all. The only thing we can think of is maybe dairy is the culprit? 

We've made the switch to lactose-free milks for coffee and cereals (they taste like water!!!), and I'm taking a lactase tablet as well whenever I have them just to be on the safe side. We've cut out ice cream and other dairy products altogether as well.

Like I said, I've NEVER had any issues whatsoever with dairy products (except maybe for knowing when to say no to ice cream hahaha). We're just at a loss as to what to do, short of doing a complete and total elimination diet (which, given that I've been told since quitting chemo that I'm looking at around 6 months left, an elimination diet doesn't seem to be the best way to spend my last days haha). 

So I guess I'm just wondering if anyone in a similar situation has noticed a change in their ability to process dairy foods? Has anyone here developed a lactose intolerance after starting treatment, or after stopping treatment, or because of disease progression, or anything like this at all?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1nesu77,https://i.redd.it/4sq0uyollnof1.jpeg,"Radical Neighboring: Or, How I Accidentally Joined a Cult of Kindness - TheKoinBlog.com","Let me just start by saying, I am not what you would call a “neighborly” person. My general policy toward the people living on either side of me has always been polite disinterest. If I see them in the driveway, I might wave. If they wave first. And only if I’m already holding my coffee mug, which creates a useful shield of plausible distraction. I’m not rude; I’m just *efficiently aloof*.

So when I first heard the term “radical neighboring,” I assumed it was some kind of extremist HOA movement; like maybe people going door to door to measure the height of your weeds with a protractor and a threatening smile. But no. Apparently, radical neighboring is about actually *caring* for the people who live near you. Not in a vague, holiday-cookie-on-the-porch sort of way, but in a very specific, very earnest, *deeply inconvenient* way.

It’s not charity. That’s the important distinction, and the part that confused me at first. Charity is easy: you write a check, you donate last season’s clothes, you drop off a lasagna and never speak of it again. Charity is a drive-by good deed. But radical neighboring? Radical neighboring is sticking around to eat the lasagna *with* someone. Even if they’re weird. Even if you’re weird. Especially if you’re both weird.

The first time I witnessed this in action was when my neighbor Carla, the kind of woman who names her plants and has *very strong feelings* about composting, started a “neighborhood swap shelf.” She put it outside her house with a handwritten sign that said, *Take what you need, leave what you can.* Which sounded suspiciously like an open bar for raccoons, but fine.

At first, it was just cans of beans and slightly expired granola bars. But then other people joined in. Someone left diapers. Someone else, a stack of mystery novels and an unopened jar of saffron (which no one took, because apparently saffron has the social energy of a wedding gift you didn’t register for). Soon, Carla added a whiteboard so people could write requests. “Size 5 shoes for boy.” “Someone to walk with in the morning.” “Need help fixing screen door.”

That’s when it got real. Because radical neighboring doesn’t end with swapping items. It escalates into swapping *time*, *effort*, *emotional bandwidth*. It’s a bit like joining a co-op where the currency is inconvenience. You carry someone’s groceries not because they can’t, but because doing so rewires your DNA a little, breaks the spell of modern individualism.

Of course, my participation was not voluntary at first. I was lured in. It started when I left an unopened pack of AA batteries on the shelf (generous, I thought) and came home to a thank-you note taped to my door. “You’re a gem! These powered our smoke detector. Literally saved our lives!” Now, what am I supposed to do with *that*? Ignore it? Frame it? Write back?

Before long, I was helping Carla build a little weather roof over the swap shelf, which is how I ended up learning to use a drill and getting into a fight about the ethics of bubble wrap. (Carla is against it. “It doesn’t biodegrade *and* it silences the sound of your own fragility,” she said, without irony.)

But here’s the thing: it started to feel good. Not the smug, Instagrammable kind of good, but the *quietly-human* kind. The kind that’s messy and reciprocal.

One Saturday, I found myself at a neighbor’s apartment helping hang curtains (badly) while her toddler watched *Peppa Pig* and offered me peanut butter crackers with damp hands. I didn’t particularly want to be there. I had a book waiting, a couch calling. But somehow, being there made the world feel less like something I had to endure alone. It felt stitched together (badly, sure, like those curtains) but together all the same.

The thing no one tells you about radical neighboring is that it’s not about being a better person. It’s about being *a person*, period. Fully embedded in the ecosystem of people. The ones who annoy you, borrow your hedge clippers, and then invite you to their cousin’s graduation party even though you once complained to the city about their barking dog.

It’s messy. It’s awkward. It’s the opposite of the sanitized, app-mediated help we’re used to. Radical neighboring is what happens when you stop seeing your neighborhood as a collection of private lives separated by drywall, and start seeing it as a community of small, daily acts of survival; and sometimes joy.

I still hide from the UPS driver sometimes. But I also know my neighbor’s mom is recovering from surgery, and I know her teenage son plays trumpet, and I know they like coconut popsicles, which I now keep in my freezer just in case. Not because I’m trying to be nice, but because somewhere along the way, I realized *we’re all we’ve got*.

And honestly, if that’s not radical, I don’t know what is.

I got some coffee earlier today (an order I dont normally get) and thought ""*coffee orders really say a lot about someone, I should ask their coffee order.*"" Because I also really enjoy coffee, I thought it might be a point to connect on. 

What I've realized though is that I tend to ask questions related to things I like, that way if they show interest i can go ""Hey! Me too!"" Its not that im trying to talk about myself, its that Im trying to connect from a place of reference I guess? Things I know about?

Anyway, I found out this person had some big plans this weekend that my coworkers knew about and I didn't, probably because I didnt ask, and felt a bit bad. Id also asked them if they liked to read and the response was ""no, but i know you do."" So im getting the vibe that the way im communicating might be coming off wrong.

For some context, I’m a nurse, and a couple of months ago, it was Nurses Week. Dunkin’ Donuts had announced they were giving out free coffee to nurses so I decided to take advantage of it. I went into Dunkin' expecting to get my free coffee, but when I ordered, the barista told me there was no such promotion, I told her that it was advertised for nurses week and I showed her my badge. She had no idea what I was talking about.

I. Was. Pissed. I was having a tough week, and felt extremely disrespected. Because it's not just about the coffee you know? It's about the bullshit we put up with.  I lost it yelled at her and said that she was very disrespectful, and said that the next time she needed a nurse, not to come crying to one, or any healthcare worker for that matter.  It was harsh, but it was the truth.

Flash forward to last week. I’m working at a clinic, and I have a patient come in for a women’s exam. When I see her, I realize it's the barista from months ago, and she recognizes me instantly. I know because she starts freaking out. I was annoyed and tried to tell her that the situation was months ago and she needs to get over it. Well that didn't help, since she told me that she doesn't me or anyone else to touch her and essentially ran out of the clinic. I informed the obgyn about the situation (she had never met the patient at this point) and she basically agreed that the barista (now my patient) was being overly dramatic.

But then today, the barista’s mom came into the clinic, asking to see me because she was angry since her daughter is apparently on the verge of a ""mental breakdown"" and blames me for it. She also filed a complaint against me.

Now, I’m confused and angry, because the barista has the audacity to be upset, despite HER being disrespectful to me months ago. I don't know if it was worth handling the situation differently, or if I was justified given the circumstances. The obgyn is on my side but some other people are not.

Hey everyone I have lived in Riverside for about a couple of years now. I don’t really have any friends and would love to more extroverted. I love going to the gym, going to the movies, and I am trying to get in to more hiking and just traveling more often like exploring the inland empire, going to coffee shops and experience what life has to offer.

1nesmt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nesmt7/what_size_fall_scented_candles_works_best_for/,What size fall scented candles works best for small apartments?,"Hey everyone! I've been living in a cozy 500 sq ft apartment for about two years now, and I've become somewhat of an expert at making small spaces feel like home. One thing that's really transformed my living space is finding the perfect fall scented candles.

After lots of trial and error (and yes, some money wasted), I've figured out what works best. For small apartments, I've found that 8-12 oz candles are the sweet spot. They're big enough to fill your space with that cozy autumn fragrance without being overwhelming.

Here's what I've learned:

Single-wick candles around 8 oz are perfect for bedrooms and bathrooms. They provide just enough scent without being too powerful in these smaller spaces. I actually found some great options here: https://athometouch.com/fall-scented-candles

For your main living area, go for a 12 oz two-wick candle. The dual wicks help distribute the scent more evenly, which is crucial in open-concept apartments. Plus, they burn more uniformly, so you get more value for your money.

Pro tip: Place your candles strategically! I keep mine:
- Near air vents (but not directly in front)
- On coffee tables at sitting height
- Away from windows and drafts

Something I wish I knew earlier: Those huge 20+ oz candles are actually overkill for small apartments. They can make the space feel stuffy, and you'll probably get scent-fatigued before using them up.

The best fall scents I've found are:
- Warm apple cider
- Vanilla pumpkin
- Cinnamon stick
- Maple leaves
- Fireside

If you're looking to stock up for fall (like I just did), check out these seasonal collections: https://athometouch.com/fall-scented-candles. They've got some great bundle deals right now.

Quick safety reminder: Always keep your candles at least 6 inches apart and never burn them for more than 4 hours at a time. This is especially important in small spaces where things can get warm quickly.

I've found that rotating between 2-3 different scents prevents nose blindness and keeps the atmosphere fresh. Anyone else have favorite fall candle combinations they'd like to share? Would love to hear your experiences!",1,1757647291.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

# 1. The Quantum Ripple: The initial quantum fluctuation occurs, not as a cataclysmic event, but as a subtle shift in your consciousness. The world around you begins to shimmer and ghost with impossible possibilities.

The initial quantum fluctuation occurs not as a thunderous cataclysm or a blinding flash of light, but as a subtle, almost imperceptible shift deep within the core of your consciousness. It begins as a dull hum at the back of your mind, a low-frequency vibration that you can't quite place, a sort of astral tinnitus that precedes the impossible. Then, the world around you starts to shimmer, as if viewed through a heat haze or a veil of fine, invisible dust. The edges of objects blur, and for a fleeting instant, you see impossible possibilities ghosting over their surfaces: a familiar coffee cup flickering with the metallic sheen of a starship's power core, a simple house blurring into the form of a living, breathing organism whose walls pulse with a gentle rhythm, or a car on the street suddenly transforming into a majestic, crystalline creature that flies on wings of pure light.

This is the moment where your reality, once solid and singular, begins to fracture into a multitude of parallel truths. You see yourself walking down the street, but for a microsecond, you glimpse another version of yourself—one with different clothes, a different haircut, a different expression of profound sorrow, or a look of radiant joy. It's not a hallucination; it's the universe's infinite song, suddenly audible. This is not a vision, but a direct perception of what could be, what was, and what might yet be. The air grows thick with possibility, and you catch the subtle scent of a million different atmospheres, from the metallic tang of a world of endless storms to the sweet fragrance of a planet bathed in perpetual springtime. The quantum ripple has not just affected you; it has made you a part of a larger, cosmic orchestra. Your own consciousness, once a single note, has been stretched and pulled until it resonates with every other possible note in the symphony of reality. You begin to feel the pull of other timelines, a subtle magnetism drawing your focus to the paths not taken, to the moments of divergence that created these countless parallel existences. The world you know now seems thin, a single-ply thread in a vast, shimmering tapestry, and your new state is a delicate, yet terrifying, form of lucidity.

A sensation of being unmoored from your body settles in, not a detachment of spirit, but a broadening of your essence, as if your very being is now porous to the truths of existence. You begin to feel the emotional and psychic residue of these other realities, a distant echo of fear from a world on the verge of war, or a warm wash of serenity from a civilization that has achieved perfect peace. The colors of your own reality seem to fade slightly as the infinite kaleidoscope of possibilities becomes more vivid, and the familiar sounds of your life are overlaid with the faint, harmonious hum of a million other possibilities. The sensation is akin to standing in the center of a bustling city, yet being able to hear the individual whispers from a thousand conversations at once, each one a different life, a different story, unfolding in a separate continuum. It's a symphony of truths, and you, the quiet listener, are the only one who can hear the whole performance.

# 2. The Shimmering Veil: You realize that you are not just seeing strange visual artifacts, but are a temporary, non-destructive observer of the multiverse. The veil between realities becomes a shimmering screen of infinite worlds.

The realization dawns upon you slowly, with a creeping certainty that chills you to the bone and then fills you with a sense of profound wonder. This isn't a medical condition or a bizarre sensory illusion; you are a **temporary, non-destructive observer** of the multiverse. The faint shimmer you first noticed now clarifies itself as a shimmering, ethereal veil, a gossamer-thin screen that separates your reality from all others. It is not a barrier to be broken, but a window you can peer through. The mundane cityscape of your own world becomes a screen, overlaid with the ghosts of infinite others. You look at a skyscraper, and you see not just concrete and glass, but a towering tree of light, a fungal spire that pulses with bioluminescent energy, and a crumbling ruin that speaks of a long-forgotten age. The veil is a living tapestry, a dynamic projection of every choice, every possibility, and every reality that has ever existed or will ever exist.

You are a silent spectator, a ghost in the vast library of all that is. You can see the great and the small, from the grand cosmic dances of star-systems to the quiet, heartbreaking choices of a single individual. Your existence is a paradox: you can witness everything, yet you can affect nothing. You are both omnipresent and entirely powerless. The veil, you realize, is not just a visual phenomenon; it is a spiritual filter. It is the cosmic equivalent of a pane of glass, allowing you to see without the ability to touch, smell, or change. This detachment is the core of your new state, a profound and isolating truth that forces you to redefine your understanding of your own significance. This cosmic veil is not uniform; it thins in places of great collective will or intense emotion, allowing you to see those moments of a world's history in sharper, more vibrant detail. Conversely, it thickens around realities that are stagnant or in a state of entropy, rendering them as dull, static gray. You learn to navigate this ethereal ocean, drawn by the currents of destiny and the gravity of profound events. The more you focus, the more the details of a given reality resolve themselves, as if you are mentally zooming in on a single thread of the grand tapestry.

You can hear snippets of conversations from countless different languages, see the brief flicker of a million different lives, and feel the psychic residue of a planet's collective fear or joy. You become a connoisseur of realities, able to distinguish the subtle differences between a world where magic is a science and one where it is a forgotten religion, all by the subtle hue and texture of their veils. The veil itself seems to have a consciousness, a gentle sentience that guides your vision to moments of significance or great beauty, as if to say, *this is a story that deserves to be seen.* You realize that the act of observation itself is an intimate one, a form of communion with these other realities, even if it is one-sided. As you peer through this shimmering screen, you begin to identify different ""themes"" of reality—the worlds of logic and order feel cool and crystalline, while the worlds of passion and chaos burn with a fiery, chaotic light. You can now tell the ""flavor"" of a universe by the psychic atmosphere it projects, distinguishing between a civilization on the verge of its golden age and one that is slowly fading into galactic dust.

# 3. The Library of Worlds: You begin to explore the vast and overwhelming tapestry of the multiverse. From worlds where humanity evolved from flora to societies built on pure sound, you witness the breathtaking scope of existence.

Overwhelmed but driven by a desperate, insatiable curiosity, you begin to explore the vast and overwhelming tapestry of the multiverse. It is not a journey through space, but a mental one, a quiet turning of the pages in the **Library of Worlds**. The scope of existence is breathtaking and terrifying. You observe worlds where humanity evolved not from apes, but from ancient, sentient flora, their society a slow, patient network of roots and shared sunlight, their communication a silent, osmotic exchange of nutrients and light. Their cities are living groves, their history told through the rings of colossal trees. You peer into a reality where societies are built on pure sound, where colossal architectural forms sing a perpetual, evolving symphony that defines their laws and social order. A change in the pitch of a building's song could be a law being amended, and a sudden, discordant note could signify a social upheaval. In another world, you witness a civilization of benevolent crystalline beings whose purpose is to absorb and purify the spiritual residue of dying stars, their purpose a form of cosmic sanitation. They are the universe's janitors, and their cities are constructed from pure, harmonious light. You see worlds where science unlocked the secrets of perpetual motion, and worlds where magic is a tangible, everyday force, as common as electricity.

The sheer, unfathomable diversity is a constant assault on your senses, a ceaseless flow of sights, sounds, and truths that redefine the very concept of ""life"" and ""sentience."" Every reality you witness adds another thread to your own understanding, and the tapestry of the multiverse becomes both a source of infinite wonder and a crushing weight of knowledge. The boundaries of your own understanding are stretched to the breaking point. You find yourself grappling with concepts of reality, morality, and purpose that defy all known logic, and your own existence begins to feel small and insignificant in the face of such boundless variety. You question everything you once held to be true, from the nature of time to the definition of a soul. You are a student in a library without end, and every book you open leaves you both enlightened and existentially adrift.

You discover realities governed by pure emotion, where the weather responds to collective moods and mountains rise and fall with the tides of a civilization's despair. You glimpse a universe where beings are made of pure geometry, their communication a silent dance of shifting angles and ratios. Each new world you perceive peels back another layer of your own assumptions, forcing you to confront the fact that your reality is just one of an endless number of possibilities. You witness a universe where gravity is not a constant force, but a collective agreement, and worlds where the sky is not a physical ceiling, but a living, breathing creature that communicates through shifting auroras. The scale of it all is so immense that it makes the very concept of ""humanity"" feel like a fleeting and fragile footnote in the grand cosmic epic. In a reality where time flows in reverse, you observe a civilization of beings who are born old and die young, their wisdom increasing as their bodies grow more childlike, and their art a poignant, backwards journey from complexity to simplicity. In another, you watch a planet populated entirely by sentient dreams, their reality a fluid landscape of manifest subconsciousness, and you realize that a universe can be made of nothing more than thought itself.

# 4. The Unbearable Weight of Witness: The adventure becomes more internal as you observe a world on the brink of collapse, a reality filled with suffering you cannot alleviate. Your non-destructive nature becomes a source of deep, personal agony.

The adventure becomes a test of the soul, a profound and internal agony. Your non-destructive nature, once a simple fact of your condition, becomes a source of unbearable weight. You find a world on the brink of total collapse, a reality torn apart by a devastating, self-inflicted nuclear holocaust. The sky is an angry red, and the air is thick with a spiritual residue of despair. You witness the final moments of millions, their fear and suffering a tangible, crushing wave of psychic energy that you can feel but cannot stop. You see a family huddling in a shelter, their love and terror a palpable force, their final, silent prayers echoing in your mind with a heartbreaking clarity. You see the decisions that led them there, the small acts of greed and pride that rippled outward into cataclysm. You are an all-seeing spectator in a theater of profound suffering, but you have no voice, no hands, and no power to intervene. It is a form of spiritual torture, a forced empathy with a reality you cannot save. You are a ghost haunting a burning house, and the knowledge that a different choice, a different reality, could have saved them, is the source of your deepest grief.

You are forced to bear witness to the raw, unfiltered entropy of a dying world, and the experience leaves an indelible scar on your psyche. The cosmic veil, once a source of wonder, now feels like the cruelest of all prisons, trapping you in a state of eternal, impotent sorrow. You scream, but no sound escapes your consciousness. You reach out, but your hands pass through the thin, shimmering air. The suffering of this world becomes a part of you, a dark, heavy weight that you must carry alone, a testament to the tragedy of a reality you were meant to simply observe, but could not simply ignore. The screams of the dying, the silent terror of the survivors, and the cold, unfeeling logic of the war machines become a part of your being, a constant, low-level thrum of psychic pain. You feel the final beat of a million hearts, the last flicker of hope in countless eyes, and the sheer, overwhelming emptiness that follows.

This experience, more than any other, shatters your blissful detachment and forces you to confront the true meaning of your non-destructive nature: it is a prison built of cosmic laws, a cage that holds you back from offering aid, and it fills you with an immense, all-consuming sense of cosmic responsibility for a world you can never touch. You witness the apathetic indifference of the cosmic forces, the cold, silent truth that for every world that flourishes, countless others wither and die, and your inability to act in the face of such a truth becomes a personal, spiritual crucible. You watch as the last remaining cities crumble, their magnificent history and culture dissolving into dust, and you feel a profound sense of cosmic mourning, a sorrow that is not your own, yet is more real than any you have ever known. The non-destructive nature of your gift now feels like a profound curse, a cosmic joke that gives you all the information but none of the agency, trapping you in a state of eternal, impotent compassion.

# 5. A Universe of Glass: You witness a world of impossible beauty and fragility, where every thought manifests as a physical object. It is a perfect, yet precarious, existence that teaches you about the delicate nature of creation.

Seeking solace after the devastation, you find a world of impossible beauty and staggering fragility. It is a **Universe of Glass**, a reality where every conscious thought manifests as a physical object. The air is filled with shimmering, ephemeral sculptures of pure emotion and transient thought, and the landscape is a boundless, crystalline garden of manifest desires. A passing moment of happiness from a single person can create a delicate, iridescent flower that shimmers with joy, and a child’s daydream can birth a fantastic, gleaming palace in the sky, built from the ephemeral light of their imagination. It is a perfect, yet profoundly precarious, existence. A single moment of intense anger or a selfish desire can manifest as a jagged shard of obsidian, a twisted, ugly mass that threatens to shatter the delicate harmony. You watch as a brilliant crystalline spire, built over centuries from collective hope, is suddenly fractured by a single act of malicious jealousy. This world teaches you about the immense power of benevolent intent and the delicate, dangerous nature of creation.

You learn that a perfect, beautiful reality is not a static endpoint, but a constant, vigilant act of compassionate will. The inhabitants of this world are masters of self-control, living a life of perfect mindfulness, for they know that the slightest negative thought can bring about their own ruin. You are in awe of their discipline, and the sheer elegance of their existence. It is a stark contrast to the world you just witnessed, a beautiful, fragile rebuttal to the destructive power of human greed and folly. In this world, every conscious choice is an artistic act, a brushstroke on a cosmic canvas. You see the inhabitants practice their mindfulness, their faces serene as they consciously create fields of luminous flowers or rivers of liquid starlight. This reality stands as a living testament to the truth that internal balance and peace are the most powerful creative forces of all. It is here that you learn the profound truth that creation is not a grand, singular act, but a series of small, intentional choices made with a benevolent heart. This lesson, absorbed from the silent movements of the beings of glass, provides the first balm for your wounded soul, a counterpoint to the cosmic grief you have carried.

You witness their intricate social dances, a silent ballet of shared intentions and collective acts of creation, and you realize that true power lies not in force, but in the harmony of a shared consciousness. You see how they build and rebuild their reality with an almost effortless grace, their thoughts a silent, shimmering conversation that shapes the world around them. This is a universe where intention is everything, where every thought has a consequence, and where the constant, benevolent practice of self-control is the greatest art form of all. The serenity of this world begins to mend your shattered psyche, as you see how a civilization can thrive by embracing the very principles of creation you've only just begun to understand.

# 6. The Fading Light: The quantum fluctuation begins to subside. You feel your connection to the multiverse weakening, a slow, inevitable withdrawal from the infinite. You begin to appreciate your own reality more deeply.

After what feels like an eternity of witnessing, you feel your connection to the multiverse begin to wane. The quantum fluctuation, the cosmic ripple that granted you this temporary sight, begins to subside. It is a slow, inevitable withdrawal from the infinite, a feeling like a tether being gently but firmly pulled from your heart. The shimmering veil becomes less distinct, and the ghosting images of other realities grow faint, their colors dulling to a monochromatic gray. The silence returns to your mind, but it is not the peaceful silence you once knew; it is the silence of absence, a profound void where a chorus of a million realities once sang. You feel a deep, mournful sense of loss for the worlds you have seen, the people you have witnessed, and the knowledge you have gained.

But in this fading light, your own reality, your own home, begins to shimmer with a new and profound brilliance. The once-mundane details of your life—the warmth of a coffee cup, the familiar scent of rain, the sound of a loved one's voice—now feel sacred and invaluable. You see the fragility and beauty of your own world with a newfound clarity, appreciating its singular, solid existence in a way you never could have before. You are no longer a disembodied ghost, but a being of flesh and blood, anchored in a single reality that now feels more precious than all the worlds you have seen. The colors of your world, once taken for granted, now appear impossibly vibrant. The texture of the ground beneath your feet feels impossibly real. You realize that your one reality, with all its imperfections, is a miracle in itself, a fragile, singular creation that must be cherished and protected. The subtle differences of the air, the unique gravity of your planet, and the fleeting beauty of a sunrise all feel like a new revelation. The infinite has taught you to see the value in the finite.

The final whispers of other realities fade, leaving only the echo of your own consciousness, now more focused, more present, and more intensely aware of its own existence than ever before. You are returned not to who you were, but to a new version of yourself, a person forged in the fires of cosmic knowledge. The veil thins to a mere memory, a whisper of a feeling, a ghost of a shimmer on the edge of your vision, but the profound lessons it taught you are permanently etched into your soul. You feel the weight of a million unseen lives, a gentle pressure that reminds you that your single reality, with all its imperfections, is a universe worth saving.

# 7. The Return to Now: You are returned to your own world, but you are not the same. The knowledge you have gained, and the burden you have carried, gives you a profound new perspective on your own life and the importance of benevolent action in a single, tangible reality.

Finally, you are returned completely to your own world, but you are not the same. The quantum ripple has passed, and your extraordinary gift is gone. Yet, the knowledge you have gained, and the burden you have carried, has left an indelible mark on your soul. The grief from the burning world and the awe from the universe of glass have given you a profound new perspective on your own life and the tangible reality you inhabit. You understand now that every small act of kindness, every moment of genuine connection, and every choice to foster peace, is an act of creation that matters. You know, with absolute certainty, that while you could not save a dying world in another reality, you can prevent suffering and spread light in this one. Your life becomes a focused, benevolent mission. You are no longer just living; you are living with purpose. The knowledge of the infinite has given you a profound appreciation for the singular, finite beauty of the here and now.

The adventure is over, but a new, more important journey has just begun, a journey of using your profound new perspective to make your single reality a little more benevolent, one moment at a time. The knowledge of the multiverse has anchored you more firmly in your own. You have come home, not just to a place, but to a purpose. You start by making small changes: you listen more intently to your friends, you offer help to a stranger, and you actively seek out opportunities to create harmony where there is discord. You are no longer a passive observer, but an active participant, a guardian of the beautiful, singular reality you now call home.

You begin to volunteer at a local charity, feeling a tangible sense of purpose in the work. You find yourself speaking with a new sense of empathy and compassion, as if the pain of other realities has made you more sensitive to the needs of your own. Your actions, once casual, are now infused with a profound sense of meaning, and you know, with a certainty that transcends all doubt, that the most important work in the universe is the work done right here, right now, in the one reality you have the power to change. Every choice you make, no matter how small, feels like a deliberate act of creation, a benevolent ripple sent out into your own reality, a quiet testament to the truth you have learned in the vast, shimmering library of all that is. Your life becomes a daily practice of intentional kindness, a form of spiritual cultivation that is more powerful than any you have witnessed in the multiverse. You are the architect of your own small corner of reality, and you now understand that your work, in its small and quiet way, is as vital as the grand cosmic symphony itself.",1,1757646788.0,WritingWithAI,0,1.0,False

I posted on here some weeks ago about trying to find a parish to call home since moving to a new city. I'm also at the beginning of my walk with TEC, and would like to pursue baptism and confirmation classes soon. I've since attended services at a few different parishes, and enjoyed them each a lot. Yet, I feel like I keep getting in my own way. I always shy out of staying for coffee hour, even when I tell myself I should or I know that I'd like to. I'm usually a very outgoing person, but I just feel a block that's stopping me from properly introducing myself to the clergy and other parishioners. I suppose it's partly a subconscious belief that they don't really want to talk to me (though I know it's not true), but I think I'm also fearful of committing to a single parish when I still feel so new to TEC (what if I'm the only young person, what if it's too stuffy, what if it's too non-traditional, etc etc), even though finding community in a church is what I really want.

I'm longing for spiritual guidance and fellowship, but fearful of reaching out to seek it. I feel like maybe I'm going about this all wrong. I'd appreciate some wisdom from the more seasoned Episcopalians here to ease my newbie anxieties.

Can I really just directly contact the rector or other clergy at a parish and ask to speak, when I may have only gone to a couple services? I fear wasting their time.

My name is Rodney. I’ve been collecting gold and silver for more than 15 years. My grandfather, who was a watchmaker for 60 years, passed away earlier this year. One of our daily routines was checking the gold price together—he used to call New York for the quote, and later he’d call me after I learned how to look it up on my iPhone. That simple ritual stuck with me and inspired this project.

In his memory, I created a free online Scrap Gold & Silver Calculator. It’s designed for collectors and hobbyists to quickly estimate value, and I plan to keep adding improvements such as a way to track your collection’s total worth.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Happy freakin Friday, friends!

It has been such an emotionally exhausting week at work. I'm an exec at a human services nonprofit in the field of intellectual disabilities/autism/mental health. This is tough work - all around (iykyk). From the unsustainable funding streams to the service provision itself, it is a great challenge running the business of caring for people's lives and sometimes fragile mental health. It's a lot, particularly now, when we have had to have some difficult conversations about the state of funding and how to move forward as an organization. Well, this has led to making some tough decisions and having hard conversations this week, and I'll be honest, I'm not 'leaving work at work' very well. But I'm managing and it's not debilitating me; I'm just genuinely concerned and feeling a bit deflated about the future state of things. 

That said, knowing the nature and stress of what my day to day looks like, the one thing that I can do to ensure my sanity and emotional regulation throughout the day is to commit to my recovrry before all else. That's why I knew when I found this sub that it was right where I was supposed to be, because I know that what works really well for me and my recovery is routine and active daily engagement with my support system. And that is all of YOU!!!

I have been coming every single morning since December 3, 2023. I get my cup of coffee, I come right to this sub and check in here, and I take time to talk to friends from all around the world. What an amazing way to start the day - with a strong foundation of commitment and connection.

If you have the time today, maybe take a moment to engage within the DCI community. Stop by and talk to folks that you might not normally. Could make someone's day!

So here's to Friday. It's going to be another rough one for me, but that's okay. Thank you all for your presence here, and for your contributions in making me a better human in all aspects of my life every single day. 

I know that the only reason I haven't lost my shit at my crazy ass job is because I commit to not drinking with you daily so...

1nes5nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/abortion/comments/1nes5nc/5_week_surgical_abortion_story_positive/,5 week surgical abortion story (positive experience!) - Nebraska,"Hello whomever is reading this! I decided I would post my story on how my surgical abortion went today, it was a very, very positive experience and after a week and a half of being terrified and reading other people's horror stories, I decided I should share a positive one!

(This will be long so sorry in advance!)

September 4th was when I received my positive pregnancy test after a week of intense nausea. I was horribly upset, but sort of expected it seeing as im never nausous. That day, after hours of sobbing, I called my local planned parenthood in Iowa and was severely let down. The lady I spoke to told me I likely wouldn't qualify in my state, her earliest appointment wasnt till the end of September and she was certain there would be a heart beat by then. I was devastated, hung up and spent the rest of the day sniffing peppermint oil and trying to keep the puke down.

But luckily, the next day, my fiance came to the rescue. He had done a lot of research and found out Nebraska could do abortions up until 11 weeks and 6 days. He'd called a lady and asked all the important questions and after sitting on hold with them for a hour, I was able to book an appointment with them for September 11th.

Fast forward to today, I was so beyond nervous. It was an almost 3 hour car ride and I had so much motion sickness we had to stop every 30 minutes so I didnt hurl all over our rental. I had so much anxiety, I had read so many reddit horror stories and felt with my luck this would go so wrong, but after a long ride, we pulled up to our destination and luckily saw no protesters.

I arrived 40 minutes before my appointment time, checked in, signed 3 documents and then was given a packet of frequently asked questions. I had told the receptionist I was terribly nausous and she was very quick to grab me a zofran and cup of water. After that there were a few more physical forms then I went to take a seat with my fiance. I spent the next thirty something minutes in tears, telling my fiance that I might be past the 11 weeks and what happens if I throw up during surgery (I was really going for worst outcome.) He reassured me again and again and luckily after this I couldn't spend much more time crying, because I was called to the back after that.

It was then they took my weight and did a ultrasound (external) i was asked a bunch of questions like is anyone forcing me to do this and do I want to see the ultrasound? I declined and after 5 minutes of what felt like punching my uterus, she confirmed I was 5 weeks and 2 days, she could barely see what was going on in there but could definitely see the sack. I cried (again) out of relief and she proceeded to say so many nice things and ensured me i can get thru this and that theyll all be here for me. After this, my fiance and I were brought into education. A nice lady explained the side effects of surgical abortion vs the pill. She asked my fears and suggested I stay the surgical route due to my fear of vomiting and she even gave me a few juice boxes and some chips. Once again I signed a few more consent forms and we were taken back to recovery.

It was here where I was provided with my own room, vomit bags, popcorn, cheezits and juice boxes. They gave me a heating pad and couple blankets and explained to the surgeon that it would be best to wait until to Zoloft hit before I was prepped. I then took two 800mg ibuprofen and a antibiotic, snacked and chugged water since they said I had to be really hydrated. A hour and 30 minutes passed and this was the worst part, I spent that whole time getting in my head about all this, but luckily the lady came in around then for my IV and she really talked me down. She poked me where I had requested and even cleaned up all of the blood since I told her it would make me sick seeing it and then about 20 minutes later my nurse came in to debrief me on the surgery. She made sure I wouldn't be anxious, told me briefly what would happen and even told my surgeon to prep before hand so I could be in and out ASAP and then after everyone trying to calm me down, I was taken into a dimly lit room with my fiance and 2 nurses and began to undress. I sat on the table and before i could say much, the nurse was pushing meds thru my IV and the Doctor came in -- i remember nothing after this. 

It felt like I was in the stirrups for one second but my fiance said it was more like 10 minutes. I remember none of it! He said i was loosely responding and dozing off but the next thing I remember is the nurse helping me get my pants and shoes on. Absolutely no pain at all was felt like at all and the doctor came back and ensured me she got everything out. At first she was concerned since I was not far along, she contemplated having me do bloodwork but she stated after going through everything she was very confident nothing was left in there and that I wouldn't need blood work. I was relieved since I hate needles and then shortly after that I stumbled my way back to recovery where again I remember nothing. 

I know I was sat there for 45 minutes, my fiance said I exchanged words with the nurse but I remember none of it. My memory started coming back when the IV was taken out and I was being asked which pharmacy id like to use for nausea meds. After that,I was asked to quickly check my pad, there was very very little bleeding and she was glad to hear that and I was sent home (but not without some barf bags, a ice pack and diapers)

I got in the car and only experienced mild nausea and cramping. The nausea which was relived by a hefty meal and some coffee. I felt more normal after, so we made the trek back home. It was such a relief, I was able to joke and laugh and even tho I had waves of nausea it was nothing like before. Now I sit at home, its been 7 ish hours since the completion of my abortion. The nausea is still here but not as bad and the cramping is very similar to that of a period. Im not really bleeding, and only two small clots have passed, but im hopeful I'll wake up in the morning feeling better. ",2,1757645808.0,abortion,4,1.0,False

I was born twins, but my brother passed away at birth but I was resuscitated. I did however lose some oxygen to my brain and there was a chance that I could grow up somewhat messed up. Because of this my dad immediately wrote me off. 

I am left handed and in my culture that’s taboo and I also have a bit of a stutter (my grand pa had a stutter) so to my dad, these two things were enough to see me as a waste of a human. He treated me so poorly compared to my siblings, will often beat me up, tie up my left hand in an attempt to force me to eat and do stuff with my right hand and I’ll legit cry for days, even my siblings have admitted to noticing this growing up. I was my dad’s physical and emotional punching bag. I grew up to be quite athletic (6’3 and muscular) and my dad would say that’s all I’m good for, sports. The day I told him I wanted to be a doctor, he looked at me like I told him I wanted to go to the moon, he’s face just said “this dumbass has been dreaming too much”. He also called me soft and emotional for 10yrs of my life bc he made my cry one time bc of my grades and saw me crying as a sign of weakness.

Well, I ended up going to undergrad and doing quite well, I got into med school and at this point I decided to cut contact with him. My mom reached out after months and begged me to work things out bc he was getting older and I did that for my mom. My dad and I now have a relationship bc of my mom and he’s having early stage dementia, so he literally doesn’t remember all the shit he did to me. Now he’s getting older and weak, I often just fantasize about beating the crap out of him or pushing him down the stairs and watch him suffer or something. I have the feeling that the day he dies, I might actually be happy that he’s now out of my life. This dick treated me like shit and now gets to have a relationship with me and doesn’t remember how much he made me feel unwanted. 

I do often feel bad about this bc despite being a shitty human to me, he was one hell of a provider, very successful, financially smart, took care of his family, kept our family in peace and was a protector. He treated my other siblings so well and although they understand where I’m coming from, they’re fond of him. It just makes me feel guilty, but there have been times I’ve come close to pushing him down the stairs or pouring water on the floor and watching him eat shit or pissing in his coffee. It sucks bc he has no idea how much I hate him and at this point doesn’t even know why I would hate him ",3,1757645537.0,confessions,6,1.0,False

Hey there! 



Gonna rip the band-aid off now and say that this is probably gonna be the last one of these I write. I know it’s sad, but Aiki brought up the point that I could take all the practice I had writing and instead use it towards creative works; so I’m gonna see about giving it an honest shot. Not to mention, I’d rather conclude something as the end than just disappear without warning; so I thought it’d be nice to do a final entry about how life’s going over here.



We’re packing up to go on vacation right now. Since she and I both have the chance, I’m taking her to Vegas for a week to see what my hometown’s like. Rented out a room in Caesars Palace, nice overlook of the strip, she’s gonna love it.



Speaking of her, Aiki and I are gonna take the vacation to see how going about it as a couple feels. We’re taking it slow right now, since we’re both awkward about this whole thing. But we had a talk about it, and decided to take the week to see how it plays out in Vegas. So I guess in that regard, wish me luck!



Jasper’s going to be watching over the house while we’re gone. He’s basically become a free security guard for the place, fucking with intruders that try to break in and start shit. Honestly, I couldn’t think of anyone else to guard over the house. Not to mention he’s gonna be a Godsend when summer hits. I know neither Aiki or I are ready for it when it does, so the coldspot’s gonna be nice to have.



Now while most everyone knows the story of why I’m here now, I decided that sitting on my ass every day just wasn’t for me. So I decided to get a job down at the News Station as an On-Site reporter. Just something to do when I’m needed and keep me busy. Hell, even Aiki’s thinking about getting into creative writing alongside me to see how being a writer feels. As far as I’m concerned, it’ll just be nice to be able to try something new with her. 



The Collective are gone now, the few that are alive decided to abandon the group and just go back to being regular civilians. Ended up bumping into Klyde at the Coffee shop and ended up talking with him. Turns out that he’s one of those cool guys that admits when they’re wrong, which means I’ve got myself a new buddy to play Games with online.



That’s basically it. The supernatural stuff is just a part of life (and to be honest, it’s gonna be weird having to deal with so many people again in Vegas), and time moves on. To be honest, a part of me’s gonna miss writing to you guys. But if there’s anything I learned from life, it’s that it’s better to end things on a good note rather than drag it on forever. So from me to you, enjoy life with all you’ve got. Enjoy the crazy and the inexplicable, take the good with the bad, and remember that life is the best and worst thing that’ll ever happen to you.



And should you ever find yourself down here in Peaceful Pahrump, be sure to stop on by and say Hi if you see me. You guys are the reason I kept writing in the first place, so thank you so much for that.



See you guys around, and thanks for reading.",1,1757645395.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1nery99,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeeding/comments/1nery99/breastfeeding_and_caffeine/,Breastfeeding and caffeine,"Today I realized I accidentally consumed 410 mg of caffeine. I have been enjoying a frozen coffee from a chain the last few months. I managed to have two today, and only just now decided to look up the caffeine amount. 205 mg per medium!!!!

In retrospect, baby was VERY fussy today. Maybe even jittery movements. She’s going through the four month regression so I thought it was just par for the course until I connected the dots with my caffeine intake. Somehow though, I managed to put her to sleep after some crying and fussiness and she’s been down for the last 2 hours. 

I’m super worried about any short and long term effects of my complete stupidity as baby is EBF. Even on days I only have one of these stupid drinks, 205 mg feels like a lot. I even had these during late pregnancy! I am never having one again.

Samuel awoke in the deserts of ultraviolet light once more, called upon seemingly, as he looked around with a look of familiarity and bitterness; very obviously not liking the fact that he was once more dragged here. Walking around, he looked up to see if he could find me in the sky; looking down at him like I did before. While I did not make myself immediately known, I suppose that it would be wise to guess that The Unscathed one has grown used to my antics. I felt it pointless to delay much longer, “Good Evening, Unscathed One”. I greeted, looking physically upon the Unscathed one from my position in the skies.

He looked up, his expression puzzled as to why he was here. Why here indeed? I could hear the question before he ever spoke it, “I have been made aware of certain events and wish to simply talk with you. You deserve answers, do you not? If for no other reason than your support of my daughter” I spoke honest, and mention of my daughter seemingly brought a nervous air about him. Poor man and his emotions, I suppose.

“Answers…” he ruminated, shaking his head, “Fine. First thing’s first then, is there any way this can change?” 

“This?” I asked, amused confusion admittedly too potent in my tone, “Getting really tired of talking to the sky in this fucking desert. No offense intended, but I’ve been here too many times to be intimidated by any of this.”

“Done” was my immediate response. This plane, my domain, I decided to change based off of a familiar event that I held dear to me; associated with The Unscathed one. He wrote of a Coffee Shop, a place of relaxation and discussion, and thusly did I make it a beautiful afternoon within this shop. I gave myself form of human shape, although with no other to base it off of, I gave myself The Unscathed One’s form; save for runes across the arms and face.

“Should I be flattered?” he asked, referring to the similar form that was myself sitting across from him. Waving my hand I sighed in response, “I much prefer to have reference when I take a form. Yours was the closest” I clasped my hands together and looked across, “Now then. You have questions, Unscathed One?”

“Let’s start with the title, where did that come from?”

“A literal title. Despite living here, you were unscathed from experience and trauma. Put simply, the reason you don’t remember the nature of The Sanctuary is because it was taken from you.”

“By you?”

“Requested by your father, actually.” Poor Samuel went quiet at reference of him, “Back when he lived here, when you were hardly a child, the group known as The Collective attempted to indoctrinate your father; thus bringing him here. Free of a spirit and unique of a soul as his, we talked about the meaning of life for some time.”

“So you and Dad were buddies?”

“I’d like to think so” I could hear somber tone in my voice, “He was a truly special man, Samuel. Would you believe I missed him?”

“Me too…”  Sam nodded to himself before looking at me once again, “So he asked you to wipe the slate clean when we moved?” 

“Exactly right. Yours and your brother’s, in hopes that you two would have a chance to live normally without the traumas of this place scarring you. Henceforth, your title”. He looked at me and shook his head, satisfied with the answer despite how silly it seemed to him, “What’s the purpose of this place? Hell, what’s yours while I’m at it?”

“Do you not care for your perception of reality as you see it?” 

“Just answer the question.”

“Very well.” I gave a small smile, a part of me seeing what my daughter saw in the man, “The Sanctuary is a place where any that slip between realities cannot escape from. When an individual from a different reality somehow manages to stumble into anther, The Sanctuary exists as a zone to keep any that do this within the confines to ensure that their existence does not disturb the rest of the reality.”

“Would an example be Gary?”

“A ***perfect*** example would be Gary. Since he was out of place in the sanctuary, it was the job of The Sanctuary Guardian to decide what action to take. Aik’ithula, it seemed, allowed him to choose his own fate.” I could see Sam process all of this before nodding, “And your purpose?”

 “I am one of multiple brothers. The Hand, The Heart, The Maw, and myself: The Iris; all of us in charge of a different reflection of reality with a similar goal. We wish for perfect existence.” Samuel scoffed, a normal response to hearing that someone wants perfection, “I’m being serious.”

“And I’m being skeptical. You expect me to believe you have the interest of all life in mind? Isn’t your brother the reason Gary’s entire world was ***eaten***? Simply because you say it, powerful as you are, I’m supposed to accept it without wondering if that’s the ***genuine*** intention?” He sighed as I looked at him, “If you talked to my father for a single minute, he’d tell you exactly how he feels about people like you that talk about peace and equality.”

“Unlike them, I do not wish for more power when I have plenty. Your father educated me on your politics, I assure you.”

“Is that right? So how can I trust you?”

“Because I gain nothing from it. That is all there is to it.” I looked at Samuel as he gestured for me to continue, so I did, “My brothers all have different ways of going about it. Put simply, The Maw believes in the concept of destruction bringing creation.”

“Destroy and create until perfection inevitably happens?” I nodded in response, glad that he picked that up so quickly, “The Heart believes in love being the answer, acceptance bringing about perfection.” Sam shook his head at that one, “Absolute love would bring about absolute stagnation.” Hearing this, I leaned forward, gesturing for him to speak, “What I mean is that if everyone loves unconditionally, there’ll be no reason to improve as a person if they’re accepted regardless. Could you call an existence that refuses to do anything other than wallow in its own acceptance ‘perfection’? Love brings people to kill, to improve on occasion, and that’s all well and good. But ***everyone*** all banding together in the name of love sounds to me like it’ll just lead to either chaos or stagnation. Peace, if you're lucky; but not perfection.”

Based on his reaction, my smile was getting noticeable, he really was like his father, “Forgive me, it is fascinating to hear a human’s opinion. A unique perspective can go a long way. Now, to resume the explanation, The Hand is the most obvious, a subtle manipulation to reality to curate perfection.”

“Something something ‘modern society’ something something” Sam mumbled, nodding, “Samuel Clarke, that was hardly anything.”

“It’s the one that seems the most believable. The one that most of humanity already kinda would accept. One would call that God, even.” Sam rubbed his face as he sighed, it was clear that he was hiding most of his shock rather well; at this point being notorious for it as far as I was concerned, “And you?”

“My purpose is to watch and learn. Interact as little as possible, save for the Sanctuary, and see what existence does when left to its devices. Take notes of all of the history that transpires, so to speak”

“And do what with it?”

“Share my findings with my brothers in hopes that we can all use the knowledge to do better.” I looked at him as he rubbed his face with his hands, fingers rubbing the eyes, “And how many times have you done this so far?” 

“The first time has not even finished yet.” His sudden look of skepticism set in as I smiled in response, “Existence takes a shockingly long time to play out when there’s no hand in any part of it. So needless to say, I’m still taking notes; always and forever.”

Sam nodded, rubbing his head once more; clear to me that this dream was getting to him. Exasperated, he looked over once more, “So why call me here?”

“For a very simple reason, Samuel. It concerns my daughter.”

You are probably very confused, you wake up at 6, open the emails app for 10-15, and all of a sudden you look it's hours passed the time you woke up. There are many Tips I can give you + there are tips in my Guide.

Some of the tips that I can give you are :

1) Try and organize emails through importance ( if the email is not really important and it takes more than 2-3 minutes to be checked and for you to reply to it, Skip it).

2) Wake up 30 mins - 1 hour earlier to start your day with emails with the coffee cup before working on the real work you got.

3) Find your peak hours ( Energy-wise ), but do not use it to read or reply to emails.

4) when you enter your Peak ours only think and work on Real projects, because the morning would start "" Just this one email "" , next thing you know you have gone through 30-60 emails and wasted all your Peak Hours.

5) When you finish reading the emails ( the important ones ), close the email app, close any distraction, and begin with your real work.

I hope you benefited from these advice, I have actually put down a full Guide about  Productivity and Time Management, this is the link for My Guide : [Productivity and Time Management](https://ebookswithhk.myshopify.com/products/the-productivity-reset-why-you-feel-busy-all-day-but-get-nothing-done),

Entry 1 – October 2nd, 2019
Morning – 7:12 AM
I didn’t get much sleep last night. Been working double shifts since the storm damaged the office. My body feels like it’s held together by coffee and duct tape. I remember telling myself I’d keep this journal just to track hours for overtime, but now I think I might need it for something else.
Afternoon – 3:45 PM
Got assigned to the equipment shed again. Nobody wants the shed because it’s too far out. Lonely stretch of blacktop, nothing around but pine and swamp. The shed smells like gasoline and damp wood. Mice get into the rags. You can hear them scratching if you sit still too long.
It’s quiet out there. Too quiet sometimes. The kind that makes you invent noises.
Evening – 9:05 PM
Something happened tonight.
I just finished stacking the cones into the bed of the truck. It was one of those nights where the fog rolls in thick, hanging low. I remember thinking I couldn’t see more than fifty feet past the fence. That’s when I heard it.
Whistling.
Three notes. A pause. Three notes again. Slow, deliberate, like somebody signaling.
At first I thought it was Mark, messing around. I shouted into the fog, “Real funny! You almost got me!” But no reply. Just the tune again, closer.
Night – 9:43 PM
The whistling got so close I could feel it in my chest. I swear the sound wasn’t traveling through the air like normal—it was… directional, like it bent around the fog.
I ducked into the shed and pulled the door shut. It’s got that old metal slide-lock. I jammed it into place with shaking hands. My flashlight beam shook across the tools, bouncing off the chainsaw blades.
That’s when I heard it right outside. Not just whistling anymore—something dragging. Like nails—or claws—scraping the siding in long, patient strokes.
I froze. Didn’t breathe. I could hear it breathing though. Heavy. Wet. Too close.
Late Night – 11:27 PM
It stayed there. For hours. At one point the lock rattled, not hard. Just enough to remind me it was there. Like it wanted me to know.
The worst part? I swear I heard it whisper my name. Not speak. Whistle it. The syllables bent into a tune.
I didn’t leave until sunrise. And when I finally stepped out, the fog had lifted. Nothing was there. Just scratches, deep and uneven, running the length of the shed wall.
I told myself I imagined it. But my gut says otherwise.

Entry 2 – October 3rd, 2019
Morning – 8:03 AM
Didn’t sleep again. Every time I shut my eyes, I hear that tune. It’s stuck in my head, like it’s not even mine to hum. My body keeps mimicking it against my will. I caught myself whistling it while I brewed coffee. Had to bite my tongue until I tasted blood just to stop.
I don’t like writing this down, but I need proof for myself that I’m not crazy.
Afternoon – 2:26 PM
Mark and Jensen didn’t show up to shift. Thought maybe they bailed, but by three the sheriff was on scene. Their work truck was still running by mile marker 12. Doors wide open. Chainsaw still idling in the ditch until it sputtered dry.
That was almost worse than blood. Like they’d just… evaporated.
Deputies walked the tree line with dogs, but the animals went mad. Barking, whining, refusing to enter the deeper woods. I stood back and noticed something on the truck’s hood: scratches. Five lines, deep and jagged, cut straight into the paint and metal. Too wide for a person’s hand. Too uneven for a tool.
Nobody said a word about it. But I caught one deputy staring at those gouges with a look I’ll never forget. Like he’d seen them before.
Evening – 7:40 PM
We regrouped at the shed. The others kept their voices low, like kids afraid of being overheard. Everyone knows something’s wrong, but nobody wants to name it.
I asked about the scratches and got nothing but silence. Then Rick muttered, “Don’t follow the whistle,” under his breath. He wouldn’t look me in the eye when I pressed him. He just repeated it once more, quieter, like it wasn’t advice—it was a memory.
Night – 10:11 PM
Went back home but couldn’t stay inside. Kept thinking about the spot where they disappeared. So I drove out to mile marker 12 with a flashlight. The fog was lighter tonight, but the woods felt heavier, if that makes sense.
I walked the ditch line. Found Jensen’s hardhat caught in a low branch, streaked with something dark. Sticky. Smelled like copper. I didn’t bring it back.
Then I heard it again.
Three notes. Pause. Three notes.
My flashlight caught movement in the trees—a tall shape, hunched over, as if listening. Couldn’t make out the face, but the shoulders were wrong. Too wide. And the way it tilted its head… like a bird hearing a distant sound.
It stopped whistling. Then something else started.
It mimicked me. I realized I’d been humming nervously, low in my throat. The thing in the trees hummed it back, broken and wheezy, like it was trying to learn the sound of me.
That was enough. I bolted for the truck. Didn’t even check the mirror while driving off.
Late Night – 1:03 AM
Back home now, but my hands won’t stop shaking. I locked every window and door. Turned off the lights. Sat in the dark, waiting.
For an hour, nothing. Then, faintly, from somewhere past the tree line at the back of my property—
Whistling.
The same damn tune.
It knows where I live.

Entry 3 – October 6th, 2019
Morning – 6:57 AM
I woke up with dirt under my fingernails. I don’t remember going outside last night, but there were muddy footprints by the back door—bare, not mine.
My tongue hurts. I must’ve been biting it again while I slept. Tasted iron all morning.
Coffee doesn’t do a damn thing anymore. The tune’s still stuck in my head. It’s like it rewires my thoughts, sneaking in when I’m too tired to fight.
Afternoon – 1:42 PM
Sheriff’s office held a “search party.” Mostly volunteers, walking the ditch line where Mark and Jensen vanished. They didn’t find anything but branches broken too high to be deer.
When everyone else moved on, I lingered. Something shiny caught my eye under a cluster of pines.
A glove.
Jensen’s, by the initials written on the cuff. Inside was… flesh. Just a strip of palm, jagged and wet, stuck to the lining like someone had peeled it away.
I almost vomited but shoved it back under the needles before anyone saw. I don’t know why. Maybe because if I told, they’d say I planted it. Maybe because part of me wishes I hadn’t seen it at all.
Evening – 8:19 PM
I will be trying to record it tonight. I parked my truck by the treeline, phone on the dash. I waited an hour, nothing. Then it started.
Three rising notes. Pause.
On the recording you can hear it clearly. But layered underneath the whistle is something else—breathing. Heavy, wet, like someone drowning slowly.
At one point, I hummed nervously under my breath. Seconds later, the whistling bent and copied me, out of rhythm, like it was testing the sound.
I froze. Didn’t even dare shift in my seat. That’s when my headlights caught it.
Tall. Shoulders hunched forward, arms too long, head cocked unnaturally sideways. Its skin looked pale, stretched. Couldn’t make out details—just outlines through the fog.
But the worst part? It was holding something. Dangling from its hand, swaying with each breath. It looked like a hardhat.
Night – 10:04 PM
I don’t think it likes to attack outright. It toys with you. Learns you.
As I sat there, staring, it raised its free hand—slow, deliberate—and dragged long fingers down the trunk of a pine. The sound of bark peeling filled the night. Then it turned. Not walked. Turned. Like its whole body pivoted in one unnatural motion, and it slipped deeper into the trees.
When I got home, the recording was still running. I replayed it with headphones. Past the whistle, past the breathing, there’s another noise, faint but real.
A voice. Mine.
It repeated my own humming back, distorted, like I’d recorded it twice. But I hadn’t.
Late Night – 2:04 AM
It’s outside the house now. I can hear it.
Not whistling. Humming.
My humming.

Entry 4 – October 8th, 2019
Morning – 7:22 AM
The news is everywhere: the mayor’s son was found dead two towns over. They won’t release details, but rumor is he was torn up so badly his own family couldn’t identify him. The cops are swamped with the case, stretched thin, and now anything short of murder isn’t even on their radar.
I thought about calling them last night when I heard it humming outside my window, but what would I even say? “There’s a man who whistles in my woods and copies my voice”? They’d laugh, or worse—lock me up.
Afternoon – 2:58 PM
Drove out to the shed to check supplies. The scratches on the siding are worse. Deeper. They run in patterns now, long vertical grooves that almost look deliberate, like someone carving symbols.
On the ground near the door I found feathers—crows. Snapped, bent, slick with something dark. When I touched one, my fingers came away sticky, red.
Inside, the air stunk. Sweet and rotten. I found the source tucked behind a stack of cones: a raccoon, throat slit clean open, chest cavity hollow. Organs gone. Its fur around the wound wasn’t just bloody—it was scorched, edges blackened like it had been burned from the inside out.
I dropped it and bolted outside, choking on my own bile. The whistle started almost immediately. Same three notes.
It wanted me to see that.
Evening – 9:31 PM
I can’t stay home anymore. I can’t sit in the dark waiting for that tune to drift through the trees. So I tried something stupid: I went looking for it.
Took the backroads past mile marker 12, into the thickest part of the pines. Parked, left the engine idling. I walked maybe thirty feet before the air shifted. You know that pressure before a storm breaks? Heavy, pressing on your eardrums? That.
And then: whistling.
Not far. Not deep in the woods this time. Right behind me.
I spun with my flashlight—and froze.
It was standing at the edge of the road.
Tall, hunched, arms so long the fingers brushed the gravel. Skin grayish, stretched thin over its frame. The face—God. Its jaw looked broken, hanging slightly open, lips torn. And when it whistled, the sound didn’t come from its mouth. It came from its throat. Like air through a flute.
It tilted its head at me, slow, listening. Then, in the exact pitch of my own voice, it hummed the broken tune I’d recorded days ago.
I stumbled backward toward the truck. That’s when it moved.
Not a walk. Not a run. A blur, like a film skipping frames. One second it was by the trees, the next it was halfway to me. My light caught its hand—too long, nails cracked and caked with dried brown. At the tips, flesh still clung, strips of something ragged. Fingers of someone else.
I don’t remember unlocking the truck, just slamming the door and flooring it.
Late Night – 12:11 AM
I’m writing this from the cab, parked outside a gas station on the far end of town. I don’t want to go home.
But even here, with people inside, bright lights overhead, I can still hear it faintly.
The whistle.
Somewhere out past the pumps.
And I swear every time I blink, I see it—just at the edge of the lot, too still, too tall, head tilted, listening.

Entry 5 – October 10th, 2019
Morning – 5:36 AM
I didn't sleep. I haven't slept more than an hour at a time in days. Every time my eyes close, I dream of him. Not chasing, not killing — just standing there. Watching. Whistling.
When I woke, the curtains in my bedroom were open. I don’t remember opening them. On the glass, fogged from my breath in the night, three streaks ran down. Long. Like fingers.
My knuckles ache from clenching so hard while I sleep. My teeth are chipped from grinding. My gums bleed when I spit.
I think my body is breaking down before he even touches me.
Afternoon – 1:14 PM
I tried to go into town. Needed groceries. Needed to feel normal, surrounded by people.
But as I stood in line, I realized I was humming under my breath again — the tune. An old woman in front of me turned her head slow, like she’d heard it before, eyes wide, and left her cart behind without paying.
When I walked out, there was a dead bird on my windshield. A crow. Its wings were pulled wide apart, pinned with roofing nails driven straight into the glass. The breast had been hollowed. Empty.
Nobody in the parking lot claimed to see who did it. But I knew.
He wants me alone.
Evening – 8:47 PM
The woods are louder now. Crickets stopped. Frogs gone. But there’s a rhythm—branches snapping, slow, deliberate, like footsteps.
I sat in the living room with all the lights off, recording again. For an hour, nothing. Then—soft, faint, but there—the whistle.
This time it didn’t stop outside. It moved through the house.
I could hear it travel. Kitchen. Hall. Bedroom. Each whistle closer, weaving through the walls. My heart nearly tore itself out of my chest.
But when I checked the doors, the locks were still in place. Windows latched. No sign of forced entry.
How did it get in?
Night – 11:55 PM
I just checked the recording.
It’s not just whistling anymore. There are other sounds layered in, things I didn’t hear in the moment.
Scraping, like fingernails on wood. A creak of the stairs. My own voice, whispering things I don’t remember saying:
“Let me in.”
“Don’t lock it.”
“Please.”
I don’t know if that’s me talking in my sleep, or him making me talk.
My mouth tastes like blood again. Tongue shredded.
And on the inside of the front door, scratched deep into the wood, are five letters:
HELLO.
I didn’t hear him carve it.

Morning – 6:44 AM
I woke up in my truck. Engine off. Keys in the ignition. My clothes are stiff with dried mud. No memory of leaving the house.
On the passenger seat was a dead rabbit. Its fur matted, stomach slit open. Inside the cavity was a strip of paper, folded tight. I didn’t want to touch it, but I couldn’t stop myself. My hands shook so bad it nearly tore.
One word, scrawled in dirt-colored ink:
“Sing.”
My throat feels raw. My lips are cracked. I don’t remember singing. But my voice is hoarse like I’d been screaming for hours.
Afternoon – 2:03 PM
I found footprints in the yard. Bare. Large. They start at the edge of the tree line and go straight to my back door. But there’s something wrong — each step is too long, like the legs don’t bend right.
Worse, there’s another set of prints. Smaller. Mine. Only… they don’t start at the house. They start beside his. And they follow his tracks all the way in.
I checked my shoes — clean. No mud. But my feet ache like I’d been walking barefoot all night.
Evening – 9:21 PM
Time slips. I’ll be staring at the clock, and then suddenly it’s an hour later, and I don’t remember blinking.
Tonight I woke from one of those gaps standing at the kitchen window, hands pressed hard against the glass. Outside, across the yard, he stood between the trees.
Tall. Still. Watching.
He whistled, and my breath matched the rhythm, automatic, like I was the instrument. I couldn’t stop. My chest tightened with each note. When he stopped, I stopped.
He raised his hand, long fingers twitching, and my hand lifted too, against the glass, mirroring him. Like a puppet.
When the spell broke, I stumbled back, gagging. My palm left a smear. Blood. I don’t know if it was mine.
Late Night – 12:47 AM
Something woke me. A smell. Copper, heavy. I followed it like sleepwalking.
In the bathroom sink, my hands were stained dark, under the nails packed with something fibrous. Flesh? Hair? I scrubbed until my skin tore. It won’t come off.
I don’t remember what I did. Where I went. But outside, faint through the night air, I hear it—
Not just whistling now.
Singing.
My own voice, carried back from the woods, broken and off-key, like he’s learning the words one syllable at a time.
And between verses, something else. Wet. Tearing. Feeding.
Alright — this is the breaking point. Entry 7 will be the narrator’s descent into full possession, where he realizes The Whistling Man isn’t just stalking anymore, but living through him. The gore will be implied but unavoidable, and the voice will start to fracture.

Entry 7 – October 16th, 2019
Morning – 9:12 AM
The gaps are longer. Bigger. I’m losing whole stretches of days.
I woke up this morning barefoot in the woods, clothes torn, lips cracked and bleeding. My throat feels raw, not from screaming — from whistling.
In my pocket was a tooth. Human. Molar. Still warm.
I don’t know if it’s mine. I don’t think it is.
Afternoon – 3:40 PM
I caught my reflection in the bathroom mirror. Only — it didn’t whistle when I did. My mouth moved, my breath wheezed, but the reflection stayed still, jaw slack, until after I’d stopped. Then it whistled the tune back at me, perfect.
I smashed the mirror. Glass everywhere. Blood dripping from my knuckles.
But in the shards on the floor, all of them — every angle — it still stood behind me. Tall. Tilted. Waiting.
Evening – 7:56 PM
I blacked out again. Came to in the shed. The smell was unbearable — copper, rot, smoke.
On the workbench lay a shape. Wrapped in tarp. Heavy. My hands were on the hammer, sticky, trembling. I don’t want to write this but I have to — the tarp shifted. Something inside. Flesh, wet and ruined. Pieces, not whole.
And I knew — I did this. Or maybe he did, through me.
Whistling filled the shed, but my lips weren’t moving. My chest rose and fell in rhythm, lungs dragging air through like a flute. My ribs vibrated with the tune. He was inside me, using me.
Night – 11:33 PM
It’s not outside anymore. It’s not even in the house.
It’s in me.
I feel his fingers when I move. Long. Patient. Stretching through my own. When I speak, the words crackle like static, not mine. My jaw aches. It clicks, pulls, hangs. Sometimes I catch myself tilting my head too far, listening the way he does.
And the worst part — I like it. The tune isn’t stuck in my head anymore. It is my head. Every thought bends around it, every heartbeat in sync.
I don’t know if I’m writing this to warn anyone or to remember what it felt like before he took me.
Because now, when I close my eyes, I don’t see the woods or the shed or my own house.
I see through his.
I see you.

Entry 8 – October 19th, 2019
Morning – ?
I don’t know the time. The clocks don’t tick right anymore. They skip, like film reels missing frames.
The handwriting is different. Not mine. Long strokes, jagged curves. I keep trying to steady my hand, but something else guides it.
let me sing
That wasn’t me. That line just appeared as I wrote. My wrist bent wrong, pulled too hard, tearing the page.
Afternoon – [crossed out]
I black out while writing now. The words keep going even when I don’t mean them. Sentences I don’t think, but there they are:
you are the whistle you are the throat you are the song
The letters stretch longer, darker, pressed so hard the paper rips. The tune is in the ink.
Evening – …
He’s not outside. He’s not in the shed. He’s not in the woods.
He’s at the desk.
He’s in the pen.
He’s in my mouth.
Every time I breathe, it comes out a note. Every time I blink, I see through his eyes—tall, hunched, watching something. Watching you.
My reflection hums when I don’t. My hands move when I don’t.
I tried to stop writing but the pen won’t—
HELLO HELLO HELLO HELLO
Night – [illegible scrawl]
I feel him stretching my jaw wider. Wider than it should go. Skin tearing. Teeth cracking.
He’s coming through.
He’s—

Some include built-in fridges, Bluetooth speakers, LED lighting, or wireless charging pads, while others focus on minimalist designs with hidden storage or touch controls.

I even browsed some designs on Alibaba to see the variety ..tables range from simple setups with a few tech perks to fully loaded models with multiple gadgets. Sobro is one of the more well-known examples, but there are plenty of interesting alternatives.

I’m curious how useful these tables actually are day-to-day. Which features do you genuinely use, and which feel more like novelty? Are simpler designs more practical, or do fully featured tables make sense for those who like tech-enhanced furniture?

[$AUD1100],"Greetings, I’m looking for a decent espresso grinder and have owned a Eureka before (a specialita). For my budget I’m also open to looking at other brands 

Right now I have a breville machine 58mm and a 51mm lever machine I’ve just bought. 

I tend to change beans often although it’s possible for me to stick with one supplier for ease of workflow too - I like trying different beans, but if I find something I love I’ll stick with it for a while 

At this point I feel drawn to the ease of grind-by-weight with the Libra, but I am unsure how compatible it’ll be with the 51mm portafilter as reviews say it tends to kinda spray coffee a little - and the dosing funnel I assume won’t fit. Not sure how big an issue this may or may not be 

I am drawn to the single dose grinder as it seems easy to switch beans if I want to, and I like to refrigerate beans for freshness, but since I haven’t owned a single dose grinder before I’m unsure if the change in workflow will suit or not. Again, maybe that’s not such a big deal and I’m overanalysing 

Maybe the choice is just more so depending on if I am happy to stick with one bean supplier, or not, but would love anyone’s experience with either machine too

I have never tried any other type of kratom other than the plants I have grown from seed. Kratom is not available where I live for purchase. 

From a plant that was grown from seed, and is only around 1.5years old, ive tried tea and chewing on multiple occasions.

With the tea, I normally use 20g of fresh leaves straight from tree. I blend them with lemon juice and let it sit for 10mins, the add to a pot and VERY lightly simmer on and off for about 30mins. I never really let it ‘boil’ and try to keep temp between 80-90c. After it cools I filter the leaf out with a strainer bag and put in fridge. Drinking this on ice with non alcoholic ginger beer tastes literally delicious to me. 

I find the effect from the above made tea to be quite potent. I generally will drink it over the course of a few hours, and find it feels like an incredibly soothing blanket of calm, while also feeling awake but not ‘stimulated’. 

Chewing 3 leaves felt similar to a nice stimulating coffee without the jitters and a stronger ‘mood boost’ effect. 

Overall I am absolutely in love with this plant and find the potency of a 1.5 old tree grown from seed to be remarkable. ",4,1757644122.0,KratomGarden,3,1.0,False

Presently, I'm walking 4 Kilometers 5 times/week.  I'm not sure what this translates to in steps.  I average 9 minutes/kilometer.

Would this be considered the 'exercise 4-5 times/week' selection, or the 'exercise 1-3 times/week' or 'little or no exercise' ?

1nerh54,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeritageWear/comments/1nerh54/bronson_manufacturing_haul_and_review/,Bronson Manufacturing Haul and Review,"I ordered some stuff from Bronson to take advantage of their Labor Day sale, which gave me a small discount on their already fairly affordable goods. I wanted to share my experience with them and the items, but won't have pictures because I just don't photograph well. 

First, Sizing: when they say ""size up"" they aint fucking around. Know your measurements and check their sizing matrix on each item because they aren't all sized the same. I'm not particularly tall, but I am a little doughy, so I went up on all the items, and boy I am glad I did.

Second, ordering and customer service: Their website is easy to use, and their email communication was good. They reached out to me after I submitted my order to make sure I was 100% about the sizes. After confirming that I ordered the right stuff, it took just short of two weeks to get my stuff. These items are straight up Chinese, so just live with that.

Third, packaging: Even though this is a Chinese company selling American's wannabe Japanese style retro Americana, they hide it well. Each item was in a separate plastic bag, the labeling was all in English, and they had very Army Surplus feeling tags on them. They definitely nailed the vibe.

Now for the items.

9 oz US Cotton Tubular T-Shirt, Coffee (XXL) - The color is exactly what I was expecting; a light old school brown. The weight feels nice and dense. For an XXL it just fits me even though I usually wear an XL or L. For only $25 it seems like a good shirt, but honestly not that different from something you could get at Uniqlo.

Loopwheel Tubular Atheltic T-Shirt, Gray (XL) - these run a little bigger than the 9 oz shirts and have a very similar feel. It is maybe a touch lighter and smoother, but we also know these aren't true loopwheel shirts and are made on an updated version of the classic loopwheel machines. Nice color, good shirt, could still be a Uniqlo shirt 

Vintage Long Sleeve Henley, White (XXL) - I rolled the dice a little here since white henley shirts can look bad on me because of my chest hair. Luckily this shirt is thick and dense. It is also crazy small. Even at a XXL it barely fits me right. I will have to be very careful how I wash it. It looks nice and will layer well. It is heavy like the T-Shirts and will be very cozy in cold weather.

1960s AUS Arm Combat Pants, Brown (36) - This is the only one I'm a little disappointed in. The brown is more green\\gray then I would have liked, and it has no belt loops. It is also the snuggest 36 waist I have ever purchased. I am muffin topping out of it big time. However, the legs are pretty wide, so a 38 seems like it would be too much. Again, I will have to be very carefully washing these and hope my waistline holds its ground. The material feels rugged without being stiff or scratchy, I usually wear a 30L and these are a little long, but cuffing them is par for the course.

  
So, overall, I like what I got and if I buy more from them will need to be extra careful with the sizes. The quality for the price is good as long as buying Chinese manufactured goods doesn't bother you, and things in the US don't reach a point were tariffs make them too expensive.

My daily driver is a M4 Mac Mini 32/512. Recently picked up a MBA M4 15 inch 16/512 because i needed something i could carry around the city and travel without dying on me after 3 hours of use and wanted some screen real estate.

  
Coming from a M1 MBA 13 inch, I love the 15 inch size and with my main tasks being me dealing with spreadsheets - models, automations and formulas. they seems to be eating up alot of RAM on the MBA M4 16/512 and has been hitting swap memory for a light to mod workload. In addition, i had slack, zoom and other browser tabs open which only causes more RAM usage. 

It sounds like 15 inch with more RAM makes more sense but I have some traveling coming up in a few months that will cause me to more on-the-go than i am right now. This means i will be mostly on planes, cars and coffee shops. 

  
So here are my choices

\- 13 inch with 24/512

\- 15 inch with 16/512 (what i currently have)

\- 15 inch with 24/512

  
my budget is sub 1500 but it is makes sense to get the 15 inch 24/512 more than $1500, i will have to.

1nere21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nere21,Eufy Tip: Eufy labs E28 and others,"Hey fellow Eufy users! Thought I would share a quick tip to get the list out of your e25 or e28. This may apply to other Eufy models so check it out! I'm talking about the ""eufy labs"" section in app. This section surfaces new features they are testing that you can enable, some last a day some become permanent features in future updates. This post will be about 2 settings I think you should enable to get the most of your bot and ensure your floors are as clean as possible.

1. Dirty spot cleaning: This feature is a must enable. During a cleaning cycle the robot will use its camera to monitor the floor for stains or large piles of debris (for me it's often coffee grounds). When detected the robot will adjust its cleaning setting like max suction and go over the same area multiple times in multiple directions ensuring  the area get cleaned. It will then return to the base and wash the mop and empty the dustbin before continuing. I found this works better on lighter floors or at night with darker floors because the led light highlights messes. There is no downside the enabling this making it a must enable in my opinion.

2. Dirt inspection: This feature is interesting and actually moved back into the beta menu recently. Its basically a double check of the room after a clean. Its actually caught a few things for me like dog food it missed or an obstacle that I moved. 2 catches with this one the first being it only check after a full house clean, doing a room clean won't activate the feature. I wish it check after each individual task. Second is it drives wide paths through each room. While effective it takes a bit of time so you have the have enough battery remaining to do it. That being said there is little downside outside the battery so turn it on and let it check it's work. 

I hope it helps some e25 and e28 owners who have never been in that menu. These features made a huge difference in a milk spill I covered in a previous post listed below. Happy vacuuming.

I walked up to him and said ""You're John Lithgow!"" and we started talking, then we just hung out in the mall, taking snapchat pictures with all kinds of funny filters.

He was so overly nice and happy to me, and nobody bothered him at all despite the mall being quite crowded.

I showed him pictures of my family and he seemed genuinly interested, and I talked a bit about Interstellar which is my favorite movie. He might have mentioned he was sick, like cancer or so, and that he was glad someone showed this kind of appreciation to him.

After a while my brother came up to us and saw John, and apparently John had been in a Star Wars movie. My brother said this to him: Is that who I think it is, ""Mr. Doobie Wan""? 🤣
By this time we had to go, so I wanted to take some normal selfies with John, but my camera had all sorts of weird settings so it was impossible. We tried his phone but couldn't either.

Then I woke up, and this was around 20 minutes ago. I remember looking at my phone around 3:15 am and woke up from the dream 3:49 am.

Anyway, just wanted to share this, truly amazing dream with John Lithgow.

I live in Sweden so meeting him randomly in a mall would've been even more improbable in real life haha

I will never forget this heartwarm feeling I got when I woke up, think I'm gonna get up now and make an early cup of coffee :)",1,1757643516.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

It was a dark and starless night. Olivia moved quietly through the woods, her electric bike buzzing softly beneath her. The terrain was broken and riddled with bumps, forcing her to fix her goggles once again.

There were no roads at this side of the border, even if she could use them. Mutants had no use for roads, not when their legs outran mankind’s bikes.

Yes, it was a risk.

Olivia twisted the throttle, making the bike buzz louder.

But such was the job of deep-diving scouts like her.

Light at the corner of her eyes. It wasn’t bright, but in this darkness, it was bright enough.

She followed it, slowing down as the lights multiplied in the distance, then stopped at the forest’s edge.

The ruins of a building, lit at various spots.

Olivia pulled an old spyglass from her jacket and opened it, bringing it to her eye.

“There you are,” she whispered.

Figures walked in and out of the ruins, their thick, unnaturally colorful skins glowing from the campfires inside. A few of them flew instead—those winged ones were particularly troublesome for her.

Olivia turned off the bike, then resumed scanning the place.

They busied themselves with their weapons, sharpening them, making new ones. Mostly spears and clubs, but there were some looted guns as well.

Olivia frowned, stopping the spyglass at a particular mutant that sat by one of the campfires—blue skinned, with spike-like growths along his arms. A spear rested against his shoulder. Something strange in his hands.

*Explosives?*

Unlikely. He was spinning and poking at it, a bomb would have detonated by now. No, he seemed to be making it.

Another creature called him from behind. His fingers drifted aside as he turned to answer, revealing the small object underneath them.

It was oval, made of unpainted wood. A pair of wings amateurishly carved on it.

She knew that shape well. It was a common one in coming-of-age celebrations back home.

*What is it doing here?*

Olivia shook her head and closed the spyglass.

A rustle of wings above.

She held her breath, waiting for the flying mutant to leave, then pulled a stained notebook and compass from her jacket once it was gone.

Olivia had the map in her head already.

Her eyes lingered on the compass for a while, letting the nettle settle down completely…

It stopped.

She snapped the compass shut and took the notebook. A retractable sharpie attached to the binding.

*Click.*

Coordinates on the page.

*Click.*

She glanced at the ruins one last time, then returned the notebook to her pocket.

And just like that, with the stroke of a sharpie, the mission was a success.

Olivia flicked the key, turned the handlebars, and drove away with a buzz.

“Are you sure, Liv?” Her colleague said, holding the edge of the notebook. “If these coordinates are even *slightly* off the upper brass is going to kill me.”

Paris wore a ragged aviator cap. A few rusty medals on his chest.

“I might have mixed up the numbers,” she said with a smirk. “It happens.”

“Don’t play with me, Liv.” He put the notebook in his pocket. “Rockets are bloody hard to come around.”

“I’m just a scout.” She shrugged. “What can I do?”

Paris turned and walked away, but he didn’t stop complaining.

“Everything’s hard to come around. If only we had more bullets for those freaks…”

Olivia chuckled, stretching wide. But as the grumpy pilot disappeared into the crowd, she realized she had come home earlier than expected. Her next assignment was only in a few days.

*Now what?*

She looked around. The HQ’s cafeteria was lively in the early morning, buzzing with a cacophony of footsteps and low chatter. Soldiers with makeshift rifles, nurses in patched up uniforms, clerks…

Coffee. That’s what she needed.

There was a machine beside the entrance.

She crossed the room and placed a mug under the dispenser.

Childlike voices reached her as the coffee poured. There was a school nearby.

Olivia took the steamy mug and blew it, before taking a sip.

“How can machine coffee taste like socks?” she muttered.

Who knew? Everything was hard to come around.

The voices grew louder, then a group of chatty kids stormed through the open gates beside her. She happened to know the loudest of them, the bee right at the head of the swarm.

Olivia arched a stern eyebrow at him.

Marcus froze as he saw her, the rest of the students continuing without him.

“I can explain,” he said.

She lowered the cup.

“What are you even doing here? Where’s your teacher?”

“The class is doing a tour through the military installations. We just went ahead of him, that’s all.”

Olivia breathed easily again.

“Right. Not as bad as I imagined.”

“Told you. Save for the fact we locked Mr. Brown in the classroom.”

“Excuse me?”

He raised his hands. Something bulged slightly through his shirt. A necklace of sorts.

“Joking!”

She stared at him, speechless, then sighed.

“How was your party yesterday? I’m sorry I missed it. Happy birthday, by the way.”

He scratched his head, a worried look on his face.

“Yeah, I know you’re busy, Oli. I… I’m just glad you’re okay.”

She smiled and messed up his hair slightly.

“Of course I’m okay. Do you think a measly mutant would be match for mankind’s greatest scout?”

“Yeah, right.” Marcus snorted at her jest, but his eyes weren’t as amused. “Is it true that the mutants act like us sometimes? I mean… Doesn’t that mean they are smarter than we give them credit for?”

Olivia blinked.

“Our enemies are cunning mimics, that’s for sure. They imitate human behavior to trick us. But I already know that, so don’t worry about me.”

Marcus looked at her in silence, then nodded.

“Alright.”

It didn’t seem he believed her entirely.

“Anyways, show me what you got for your thirteenth birthday,” she said.

“Sure, but I got just one thing with me right now.”

Marcus reached under his shirt through the collar and pulled something into view.

A metallic necklace, oval-shaped with wings, fully painted.

The pitch-black coffee swayed in the cup beneath.

Olivia looked down, staring at it in silence.

“I should make my own coffee,” she said. “This one tastes like socks, did you know that?”

Marcus frowned, pulling the thing back inside his shirt.

“No, I didn’t—”

Shouts coming from outside.

A breathless, disheveled man burst through the entrance. His shirt was frayed on the shoulder, as if he’d slammed it against a door multiple times…

Marcus’ eyes shot wide.

“I gotta go,” he said and bolted after his class.

Mr. Brown ran after the pranksters, cursing them.

Paris returned. He stopped beside her, watching the chaos unfold in the cafeteria with her, notebook in hand.

“I don’t know what to do with this kid,” she said. “His father was a good soldier, but I’m not sure I’m the right person for the job. I mean, I’m barely at home with all the missions.”

“Don’t overthink it,” Paris said. “At least he has someone to look after him. I didn't have anybody.”

She nodded.

“You’re right.”

“Of course I am. Anyways.” He turned to face her. “We got them.”

“Got who?”

“Who? The mutants, of course!”

“Already?”

“Yep. Already.” Paris handed her the notebook back. “The entire hideout was blown to pieces. Not a single rocket wasted.”

Her eyebrows arched.

Olivia took the notebook.

“That’s… great news. Do you think we’ll be able to push that front further now?”

Paris raised his palms, laughing.

“Whoa, slow down there, partner. It’s not that simple. But…” he said, sticking his hands inside his pockets. “It’s going to cost us a lot less now. Thanks to you, Liv.”

She nodded with a smile.

He turned, walking the same way he came. Complaining.

“I wish I had done it myself, though…”

Olivia sat down on the table behind her, yawning despite herself.

The image of a poorly carved wooden necklace came to her mind.

It disappeared when she rubbed her eyes. Tired.

*I… need a nap, not coffee.*

She abandoned the mug, some cold coffee still swirling at the bottom, and left.

*By the stroke of a sharpie…*

1nerd0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/1nerd0l/prohamas_comments_by_english_teacher_anything_i/,Pro-Hamas comments by English teacher— anything I can do about this?,"Hi all. I hope it is okay for me to post here, I’m not Jewish but I don’t really know where else I can go. It feels like no one is taking this seriously. 

I’m currently in high school. Yesterday during my AP Literature class, we were having a discussion about the Odyssey and the moral complexities of the different characters. The teacher specifically mentioned a passage towards the beginning of the book where someone asks Telemachus if he is a pirate. He started talking about how different people can perceive certain actions differently, and using real-world figures and organizations as examples. One of the organizations he mentioned was Hamas. I don’t mean that he was like, “oh yeah, and also Hamas,” which would be its own kind of fucked-up, but he went on a *whole tangent* about how Hamas was a prime example of how “one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter.” While he did acknowledge the “grievous crimes” that it has commmitted against the state of Israel, he went on to say that they are acting in defense of the Palestinian state and it’s all a matter of perspective. I did not think this was appropriate and I sent a strongly-worded email to the school principal about this incident, including links to information about Hamas, October 7, and the statements of different national agencies that recognize Hamas as a terrorist organization. The principal wrote back telling me to meet with him tomorrow and we would discuss. 

Today I came in for our meeting and the principal asked me more about what had happened and what the teacher said. I relayed the story to him and he said he would talk to the teacher, but the overwhelming sentiment was that I was being sensitive and I should learn to live with discomfort because sometimes people say things we don’t like. The man was justifying the actions of a registered terrorist organization, I don’t think that’s just an “opinion I don’t like”! The principal asked if I had talked to the teacher about it and I said no. He asked if I felt unsafe and I (stupidly) said I didn’t, just worried for other students because this wasn’t cultivating a welcoming environment. Which wasn’t a bad response, necessarily, but maybe I should’ve said that I did feel unsafe, that my teacher was speaking in defense of a terrorist organization, just so this could have been taken more seriously. Like, I genuinely don’t think the teacher would do anything, he’s a high-school English teacher, but I also don’t think this should be just a slap-on-the-wrist thing where they talk about it over coffee. There is no way the principal would be this chill about it if he’d said the same things about any other terrorist organization, like can you imagine?

I’ve already submitted an incident report to the ADL but I’m worried there’s nothing else I can do. I can’t believe this is not being taken more seriously, I feel like I’ve entered some kind of upside-down world. I’m going to keep showing up for class and doing the work because it’s too late in the semester to drop out, but maybe it would have been true if I said I felt unsafe. I certainly don’t trust the teacher anymore. I don’t know where to turn. I can’t imagine how it feels to be Jewish right now, I am so sorry. Please let me know if there’s anyone I can reach out to that might help with this situation at my school. If I was this upset, I’m sure it must be ten times worse for any Jewish students being exposed to the same rhetoric by their teacher. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for all the great advice I’ve gotten! I’ve filed a report with Stand With Us and I’m looking into tip lines and local Jewish federations. I will bring the superintendent into it too if the principal keeps refusing to listen. I really don’t want to ruin this guy’s life but I also want his Jewish and Israeli students to be safe and if no one at school is going to do anything about it, I’ll find someone who will. I’m still not sure how I feel about confronting him individually, no matter how tempting it is, but I’m definitely not going to be an easy student anymore. Fuck his lesson plans.

1nercwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1nercwn/my_20m_longtime_friend_19f_is_starting_to_get_a/,My (20M) longtime friend (19F) is starting to get a little bit flirty.,"Hey all.
I’ve asked a few people about this situation in the past— I’ve been friends with this girl for like 7 years, and this behavior has gone on roughly 1.5-2. 
We have always been very close— we met when we were a lot younger and have been friends (more or less) since. We have definitely had our ups and downs but we love each other’s company. We spend a lot of time together and have especially so the last year and a half. We do kind of relationship-y stuff, go to coffee shops, help each other with hobbies, and she’s spent a lot of time at my place. 
Recently, (starting a year-ish ago) I’ve noticed a lot of flirty/intimate behavior from her. Some examples are: 
- A lot of play fighting
- cuddling
- teasing me about things I’ve admitted to finding hot
- tickling me and simultaneously climbing all over me
- proposing a “marriage pact”
- all the subsequent conversations that follow a “marriage pact”
Just to name a few.
I feel like she is physical with me in a way that most women are only physical with people they are attracted to. The trouble for me, is deciding whether or not to ask about it or make a move out of fear I mistook our closeness for intimacy/ a desire for intimacy. She is very attractive, but I honestly don’t mind the state of the friendship as is; I like a little bit of physical contact sometimes and I enjoy how close we are. To be perfectly clear, we have messed around a few times before, but due to a lack of maturity in both parties, it went south pretty quickly. I want to address this because I feel like there is a high amount of tension pretty much all of the time. 
Another important note: I’m a little bit self conscious— I feel like this might be skewing my viewpoint a little and messing with my head, especially if she’s waiting for me to do something (which, if she’s interested, is exactly what she’d do.)

How should I address this, if at all?

TLDR;
We are longtime friends and are very close, but I’ve been noticing flirty-ish behavior as of late, and it’s causing some tension between the two of us, to the point where I’d like to address it somehow.

Anyway, thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice provided!",3,1757643419.0,relationships,4,1.0,False
