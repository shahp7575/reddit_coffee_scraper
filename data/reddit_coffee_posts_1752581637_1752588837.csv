1m0it05,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m0it05/how_one_mans_grief_destroyed_a_town/,How One Man's Grief Destroyed a Town,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her—fumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna’s passing, the twins had been born—tiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday—Emma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then—silence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it—cruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel’s alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn’t bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn’t drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of “stages,” “healing,” “coping,” while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog—a golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was “good with kids.” Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn’t ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile—as if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors—backpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper—quiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons—a plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye—plastered with “Proud Parent” stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later—cursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car—Robert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn’t fix anything. It didn’t bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest—just enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn’t enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing—one that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically—his grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill—fast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn’t stop. The child’s face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn’t move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert’s jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn’t learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine—but not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still—not enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don’t remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy—maybe six—slipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother’s scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn’t the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn’t stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water’s edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened—the gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back—a touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet—parents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn’t stop. He didn’t look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma’s crib and Samuel’s racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn’t contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy’s body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other’s eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn’t last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned—cautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn’t stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall—Miller Park—under the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn’t enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn’t feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party—balloons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise—just another utility worker. He didn’t need threats or blackmail this time. He didn’t need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma’s old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn’t shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now—not because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn’t yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck—white flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other’s arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it—looped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child’s name—Eli Meyers—suddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: “He looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.”

Then a new tab opened—her niece’s photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: “She still likes hide-and-seek, right?”

Linda’s hands hovered over the keys. She didn’t call anyone. She didn’t say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week—secondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

“Sabotage.”

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn’t make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn’t need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn’t chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it… they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren’t mourning Robert’s children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn’t enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song—""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn’t special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn’t scream. He didn’t run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely—but deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy’s brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy’s mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him—something fragile and bright—had been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn’t light a cigarette. Didn’t open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn’t revenge anymore. It wasn’t even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports—all of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn’t have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn’t over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I’m coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider’s Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it—and maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins—events that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn’t yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there—mapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don’t want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn’t just violence. This was love—twisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn’t a phone number. It wasn’t coordinates. It wasn’t a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced—simple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel’s Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria’s pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds—one tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria’s throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it— A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself—photographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn’t been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them—no bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph—Emma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo’s yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn’t look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel’s face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion—not anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn’t happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn’t forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert’s lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children—their heads drooping in the cold—and then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then—slowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn’t acted alone.

And Halston’s nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond’s edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl’s body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still—the dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn’t about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn’t trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn’t meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn’t want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox—the bus driver—took the longest. He didn’t speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn’t need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn’t needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed—small acts, each just a hair’s breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren’t.

At the center of the new web wasn’t a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone—a hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn’t recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now—typed, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We’re still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn’t she?"" ""You can’t save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now—something familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn’t needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it “looked wrong.” Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria’s front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can’t save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",1,1752588676.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

So, it's summer. I'm an adjunct professor, not currently teaching, so spending my days in hiking, photographing, listening to classical and jazz music, and otherwise completely out of routine and drinking way too much coffee.

So, I thought I would see if there is anyone else in similar situations, who would enjoy chatting from time to time. You can see some of what I enjoy above, but also like to cook, read, and ponder the imponderables of life.

I generally get along better with women (a therapist once told me I have a...feminine aura), enjoy people who can converse well, and I'm generally nerdy.

A former executive who worked at my current organization for about a decade recently took a new executive role at a different organization just last month. She reached out to me out of the blue and invited me to meet for coffee to talk about a role I ""interviewed"" for informally - though it wasn't really a formal interview.

To give a little more context: about a year ago, I had an informal conversation with their CEO, who also moved from an executive role at my current org to become CEO at this new company. He asked a coworker about me as a possible candidate, but nothing ever progressed and I never heard back. Fast forward, this exec just reached out and wants to chat.

I'm trying to figure out how to approach this meeting. She's familiar with my work and background, so I'm guessing this is more of a strategic, exploratory conversation. But since the job isn't even posted yet, I'm not sure how formal this will be.

Has anyone had a similar experience where a senior leader from a new company reached out unexpectedly?
How did you prepare? What should I focus on during the conversation? Should I treat it like a casual networking chat or a low-key interview?

My parents deny it, and I've always kind of been a girl with thicker thighs, but I can't tell I'm getting fatter. It might not be a lot but its not just some ED changing my perspective.

Another problem im having is thatI want to talk to someone, anyone. But nobody willingly wants to talk to me. The only one who did just recently blocked me. I'm not like feeling deep enough that I want to kms or sh but I need someone to tell me what I'm feeling.

All I feel is like this emptiness almost. Like yeah there's stuff that makes me feel happy but a lot of the time I'm just staring at my phone dead panned. My parents keep asking me 'what's wrong?' 'Why are you crying?' 'Were you crying?' And yeah the sentiment is sweet but its so annoying.

Dying is the opposite of leaving. When I left my body, I did not go away. That portal of light was not a portal to elsewhere, but a portal to here. I am more here than I ever was before. I am more with you than I ever could have imagined. So close you look past me when wondering where I am. It’s Ok. I know that to be human is to be farsighted. But feel me now, walking the chambers of your heart, pressing my palms to the soft walls of your living. Why did no one tell us that to die is to be reincarnated in those we love while they are still alive? Ask me the altitude of heaven, and I will answer, “How tall are you?” In my back pocket is a love note with every word you wish you’d said. At night I sit ecstatic at the loom weaving forgiveness into our worldly regrets. All day I listen to the radio of your memories. Yes, I know every secret you thought too dark to tell me, and love you more for everything you feared might make me love you less. When you cry I guide your tears toward the garden of kisses I once planted on your cheek, so you know they are all perennials. Forgive me, for not being able to weep with you. One day you will understand. One day you will know why I read the poetry of your grief to those waiting to be born, and they are all the more excited. There is nothing I want for now that we are so close I open the curtain of your eyelids with my own smile every morning. I wish you could see the beauty your spirit is right now making of your pain, your deep seated fears playing musical chairs, laughing about how real they are not. My love, I want to sing it through the rafters of your bones, Dying is the opposite of leaving. I want to echo it through the corridor of your temples, I am more with you than I ever was before.  Do you understand? It was me who beckoned the stranger who caught you in her arms when you forgot not to order for two at the coffee shop. It was me who was up all night gathering sunflowers into your chest the last day you feared you would never again wake up feeling lighthearted. I know it’s hard to believe, but I promise it’s the truth. I promise one day you will say it too– I can’t believe I ever thought I could lose you.",1,1752588148.0,u_RixxFett,0,1.0,False

One thing is that there is a 'scaling' on most of the outside of the stainless carafe.

**My question is this:** Is this scaling likely due to poor cleaning of the carafe, and can be remedied with a baking soda paste cleaning OR is this *not* scaling but rather a protective coating that has started to come off?

**Additionally,** I can't figure out what's up with the center section of the bottom. I can't find a picture online of the bottom of the carafe to know what it should look like out of the box.

* [Starbucks ](https://worldmagzine.com/stock-market/boj-raises-rates-u-s-stocks-drop-starbucks-faces-sales-slump/)will require corporate employees to work from the office four days a week starting October.
* A voluntary exit package is being offered to those unwilling to comply.
* The move is part of CEO Brian Niccol’s broader turnaround strategy for the brand.

Starbucks has announced a sweeping shift in its [workplace policy](https://worldmagzine.com/business/tcs-under-fire-bonus-cuts-and-office-return-controversy/), requiring all corporate staff to return to the office four days a week, up from the current three.

To cushion the blow for those who aren’t on board, Starbucks has rolled out a one-time voluntary exit offer.[ Employees](https://worldmagzine.com/jobs/federal-court-allows-trump-administrations-mass-layoffs-of-government-employees/) unwilling to comply with the new office mandate can opt for a cash payout and part ways with the company.

# Starbucks Sets a New Brew: Office or Exit in 4-Day Workweek Mandate

This marks Starbucks’ second rollback of remote work in less than two years, having first required a three-day in-office schedule in 2023. That shift had already stirred discontent among employees who had adjusted to the flexibility of remote setups during the pandemic. Now, with an even stricter policy, the [company risks ](https://worldmagzine.com/agriculture/vertical-farming-setback-jones-food-company-goes-under/)alienating a portion of its non-retail workforce, which includes over 16,000 corporate employees.

The initiative comes amid broader restructuring moves at Starbucks. Earlier this year, the company eliminated over 1,000 corporate roles and implemented a hiring freeze, citing cost-efficiency and streamlining. Niccol’s strategy to stabilize operations includes improving store service, speeding up order times, and simplifying offerings — but it also depends heavily on a more centralized, collaborative office culture.

Some employees have voiced concerns about executive flexibility, pointing to Niccol’s continued residence in [Southern California](https://worldmagzine.com/weather/southern-california-faces-mudslides-and-toxic-ash-threats-after-wildfires/). Though Starbucks has established a small office for him there, he often commutes via company jet, raising fairness questions about uniform enforcement of workplace policies. This has led to wider discussions about leadership credibility and employee morale.

The market response has been lukewarm. Shares of Starbucks dropped by 2% following the announcement, reflecting investor uncertainty around the company’s turnaround prospects. Still, the coffee giant has seen modest growth in 2025, with a 2% year-to-date increase in share value and a market cap of approximately $108.7 billion.

Starbucks’ revised [work policy ](https://worldmagzine.com/canada/canadas-new-visa-policy-brings-uncertainty-for-foreign-students-and-workers/)signals a bold step toward operational consistency, but it walks a tightrope between enforcing structure and retaining talent.

A year ago, I moved down south to a humble little town settled near the wetlands. Nice place, small population, close enough to society so I don't go insane.

The head of the HOA-was surprised to find this town had one actually-gave me a grand welcome speech and a small set of rules. Basic stuff: don't litter, don't feed the wildlife, no major noise complaints, don't feed the wildlife, secure your garbage from pests and of course- don't feed the wildlife.

Now I grew up in the mountains of New Hampshire, I was no dumb yank thinking it was ok to feed Yogi table scraps. I don't think he meant anything by it either- but the heavy gentleman really wanted to get that last point across. Really rubbed me the wrong way, so I've kept to myself for the most part.

Recently we've been hit with a massive heatwave-I'm talking 110-120 degrees a day. The humidity has been sky rocketing; the air is so muggy you could cut it like cake and eat it.

Lucky for me-I have a pool.

20x40 in ground with a depth of 15 feet at the end. When the wave hit, I spent every waking hour either hunched over in my office with the A/C cranked or lounging in the perfectly kept 65-degree water. 

Needless to say, the neighbors despise me. They have to contend with rinky-dink kiddie pools and barely functioning central air. We live right at the edge of the marshland, not too swampy but wild enough that occasionally something with four legs would wander in-hell sometimes even slither in. My neighbor, Ricky, once found a reticulated python curled up in his garbage can.

That was a memorable trash day.

But we've never had any major problems with the wildlife-until three nights ago. It was 10pm-I was parked on the couch next to my gorgeous girlfriend Laura. She's three years younger than me but she already has so much of her life together.

I get by on a hefty inheritance while she works her ass off trying to get through college. She wants to be a marine biologist-a side effect from living her whole life next to a beach.

We were curled up in front of the TV-being bathed in the warm glow of prime-time television. I've been trying to get her into some of the all-time classics.

Though as her face grew pale and sickly as nazi prisoners sodomized each other-I probably should have started with a lighter program. She pulled away from me as a wheelchair bound inmate began to spin around and wax philosophy. 

""Sam this show is so tone death."" She moaned.

""Awe come on- I don't complain when we're watching your shows."" I bit back. 

""Yes, you do."" She countered. She had me there of course. Laura had bi-polar taste when it came to TV; somedays she wanted to watch some reality trash, the others a mind numbingly long nature doc about whales or penguin migration. I could stomach the trash but my god there's only so much you can learn about penguins before you want to blow your brains out.

She made her way over to the kitchen counter to fix herself a drink. She mumbled something else to herself, some unheard backhanded thing that would have caused a blowout I'm sure-so I chose to ignore it. Laura brushed her tawny curls out of her face as she passive-aggressively slammed a glass onto the marble counter.

To her back was the sliding glass door that led out the yard. The pool lights were dim-yet stood out like a beacon among the steady dark. You could barely make out the mini tiki hut tucked away at the pool's edge-the pride of my yard really. From outside you could hear the droning hum of cicadas in their relentless symphony.

Sheepishly- I got up and shyly attempted to make peace. I leaned on the counter-it felt as cold as her shoulder. I averted my gaze as I attempted an apology.

""You're right-like usual."" I offered. She paused mid pour. The coke flowed into her icy glass as she burned her corneas into my face. 

""And like usual you're deflecting from the real issue. This isn't about that stupid show, and you know it."" Her voice was venomous; she'd fit right in with the snakes in the wetlands. I winced at her words- my mind gazing back to the fight we had earlier in the week.

 ""I thought we got past that."" I uttered. She scoffed as she poured a splash of rum in her drink.

 ""No, you just decided we were done talking about it-you've spent this whole week acting like nothing's wrong."" She pressed.

 ""Laura, I told you-it isn't a good time for me; I've been swamped at work-the economy is so tight right now I can't afford two people living here."" I explained. 

""You ""work"" from home and you have a trust fund-what bills do you think you're paying."" She barked at me.

""Uh-the pool, the 300$ rum you're guzzling right now, the 50-inch flat screen-"" I listed. 

""Why don't you just admit you don't want to commit-I graduate in three months, just rip the band-aid off now!"" Laura cried. Her voice cracked as she did and I was instantly flooded with guilt. ""We've been dating for two years Sam. It's starting to feel like a waste.""

She turned away from me and looked out to the yard, drink in hand. I heard a muffled sniffle as I stewed in my guilt. I love her-shouldn't that be enough? If she moved in, I'd have to change up the whole decor, my whole routine. It just wouldn't flow right.

Besides she was going to be off the whole summer on an internship so what would be the point. I swear I think she's just picking fights, so I'll beg her to stay. Still as I watched her silently gaze out the glass door-I felt a twinge of regret.

I saddled up behind her, trying to find the right words. She leaned into the sliding door, squinting as she did. I tapped her shoulder and she squeaked out a gasp and twirled around to meet my gaze. She pointed out to the pool-gripping her rum and coke to her chest as she did. 

""Sam there's an alligator in your pool.""  She motioned to the dark. I groaned in annoyance and peered out as well. At first it was hard to tell what I was looking for, the tiki hut looked untouched, grass trimmed neatly; then I focused on the pool.

There was a long shadow sulking in it-this bulky, mishappen thing floating there in the deep end. It was big-from inside I guessed about 15 feet at least. There was this hump dead center in the thing-about five feet in an arch. I couldn't make out any markings or colors-but on either side of the gator were these piercing green eyes.

They seemed to glow in the night, a haunting monster lounging in MY pool. It wasn't my first gator-they're worse than deer down here- but something about these eyes unnerved me. There was thought behind them, like it was watching us back.

I opened the sliding door and was smacked in the face by the humid night. I tiptoed out and Laura grabbed my arm. 

""Sam what are you doing?"" She hissed at me. I broke away and spoke at a low whisper.

""I just want to get a better look at it. He's basking-won't bug me if I keep my distance."" I calmly explained. She darted her eyes back to the lounging creature.

""Be careful- I think there's something wrong with it."" She couldn't take her sight off that bizarre hump on the thing-like a ridged arch almost. I shook my head and stepped closer. The grass felt cool and moist under foot-you could almost hear the squelch with every step. A few feet and I was stepping on tiled stone, the ""beachhead"" tiki bar overlooking the base of the pool.

I had set up all the bar stools and tiki decor near the deep end-so I could get plastered and just dive right in. Makes for some fun parties. My only light was the low pool LEDs lining the sides. They casted a thick shadow on our guest-but up close I got a better idea of the size.

It was 20 feet easy-slim but leathery skin gripping to it. Those light bulbs never left me-I could feel the gator drilling a hole into the side of my head. I was fumbling under the tiki bar-searching for the deck light switch.

It was a swanky set up I had; Christmas lights embedded around the roof and four flood lights on any corner. When I finally switched it on-the tiki bar burst to life with ravenous energy. The backyard became flooded with sparkling illumination.

It then quickly became apparent the thing in my pool was not an alligator.

I was met with this massive square snout-rows of pointed teeth sprouting out in a faux smile. The thing was brown and scaley-stripes of lemon yellow painted its ridged back. The ridge ran all the way down its tail-which swayed in the water like an eel.

The monster was keeping itself afloat with massive trunk-like hindlegs with three pointed talons that looked like they could easily slice me open. Its maw was flat-loose skin folded in on itself like a gular fold you'd see on a croc's neck.

That's sort of what looked like- a mutant crocodile on steroids. The creature blinked-and three eye lids folded back to reveal reptilian eyes-lime green around the slitted iris. Its arms were folded near the chest, meaty looking paws that looked like they could maul a bear.

I stood there safely behind the tiki bar-ignoring the fact that all that was between me and this monster was wicker and cheap plaster. There was this awful smell surrounding it as well-like a swamp full of sweat. For what seemed like eons we just locked eyes with each other, like we were trying to figure each other out.

From the bowels of the beast, I heard this guttural snore. It emitted a low bellow-a warning maybe. I backed away slowly, and the monster unfolded its arms. It grabbed the edge-each of its six fingers at least a foot long and ending in gnarled black claw. It slowly began to pull itself out of the pool-water sliding off the beast's hide with ease.

It didn't break its gaze on me once. I looked around-there was nothing to defend with besides poorly made barstools. The gaping maw slowly opened-the monster bellowed at me-this reptilian hiss that sent shivers down my spine. It had dragged half of its body out when I snapped out of it and booked it back to the back door.

The monster lunged, throwing itself onto the tiki bar. I didn't look back, but I heard a deafening collapse as it shattered the tiki bar under its weight. The lights snapped off-enveloping me in inky dark. My only saving grace was the beckoning backdoor-a glorious beacon among the blackness of the pit.

Laura opened the door for me-I bolted in as she slammed it shut. The sliding glass rattled and wobbled like it was going to collapse. I ran into the counter- a wild eye on me. I twirled around to see my pursuer had given up almost immediately.

It slunk back into the cool of the pool, dragging a trail of broken wicker and tangled lights with it. It swam around for a moment then went back to basking in the moonlight-those emerald embers shinning in the dark.

I caught my breath as Laura studied the creature, curiosity overtaking her like a cat in heat. 

""Laura get away from the door."" I harshly spoke. She stepped back slightly, barely listening to what I was saying. She turned to me-eyes lighting up like a child on Christmas. 

""Sam it's a dinosaur!"" She squealed. She was practically leaping up and down in awe-dare I say she was giddy. She seemed oblivious to the fact the thing had nearly squashed me. I saddled up next to her, disdain for the beast striking my face.

""Laura, that's impossible. It's a-mutant or something.  Crocodile got into some industrial run off or something."" I muttered, more to convince myself than anything. The dinosaur bellowed in the night-like a low-grade foghorn.

It seemed satisfied that it had chased me off and was just- chilling in my pool now. Laura pointed out the ridge and started raving about it.

 ""Look at that sail, almost a perfect 180."" She whistled. ""It probably wandered in from the marshlands. If it's hot here I can't imagine the sauna fuming out there.""

""Laura please just get away from the window-what if its hungry and decides it wants a midnight snack."" I spoke, realizing how frail and smashable my six hundred-thousand-dollar home was. I ran around the house like a mad man, switching lights off and drawing blinds.

Laura was following me around like a puppy dog and yapping like one as well. She had her phone out taking pictures, talking about the ""greatest discovery in history"" and ""She would call her marine bio professor in the morning.""

That last bit seemed like a dig to me-that was the guy who was dragging her away on a three-month internship in the Atlantic. She was blinded by childlike wonder-meanwhile I'm the one who actually came face to fang with that thing.

Course I wasn't going to let her go out and experience the wonder for herself-that would be a shitty thing to do. Instead, we hunkered down in my room with all the lights off and waited till morning.

I didn't sleep a wink that night. My bedroom is on the second floor-decent sized room and there's a massive bay window looking out into the backyard. I get a nice view of the yard- the hulking cypress and strangling vines, looks like something out of *Jungle Book* sometimes.

I laid in bed like a coward-watching this creature just swim gently around the pool. At times it brayed out into the night-and to my terror I realized I've heard that mournful groan before. There have been times late into the night where I'd be sitting at the tiki bar in a drunken haze and I'd listen to the midnight loon calls and the swamp symphony.

I'd hear thunderous cries and rapid chirps-like a hawk scatting to itself. I'd sit there and think ""*Damn that's a big gator*."" Fireflies would swirl around to match my vision-and I'm beginning to think some of those waltzing orbs weren't fireflies. Some of them stood in place-stalking spheres that always seemed to linger but disappeared in a blink.

While I was crashing out-Laura sat cross legged by the window taking notes like she was on safari. Around 4am I passed out-and only awoke to the searing sunlight crossing in. I sat up to find Laura was gone, and the pool was empty. I'd chalk the whole thing up to some fever dream-but that wouldn't account for my tiki bar laying in pieces and the wicker debris floating calmly in the pool.

I raced downstairs-calling out to Laura. I heard her arguing with someone in the kitchen as she was packing up her purse. Her phone was glued to her head as she rummaged around for something.

 ""-No Brian I- you saw the photos; you know me why would I make something like this up? Well, it was dark I- no I'm coming now I just can't find my keys. Alright I'll talk more when I get in."" She hung up on Brain as I cleared my throat. She looked up, excitement having not left her face since midnight. 

""Oh, good you're up. There's coffee on the stove- I got to head to class I'm in a rush. Keep an eye out for our friend just-be careful ok Sam?"" she leaned in for a quick peck on the cheek before I could get a word in.

""Wait-that's it? What about the giant lizard in my yard?"" I whined, not a proud moment I admit.

""Call me if it comes back-I saw it lumber off into the swamp around 5- I think it's hunting."" She oozed fascination with it. ""That was Brian- my professor. He's-skeptical obviously but I think I can convivence him. This is huge Sam-It could make my whole career."" 

""That-that's great."" I stammered, half happy for her, half terrified at the prospect of the dino coming back.  ""But what if it does come back? I don't have a gun or anything-what if it tries to break in?"" I whispered. She scoffed at my fear and went towards the front door after finally fishing her keys out. 

""I did some research while you slept-as long as you keep your distance it'll leave you alone. You've lived her two years without incident-if it's been out there at least that long it would it would have attacked by now. It's just hot."" She shrugged her shoulders-completely dismissing my concerns. With that she waved goodbye and drove off in her jeep, leaving me alone at the door.

I spent the morning texting her ""updates"" as I cleaned up the mess it left in its wake. I say updates but really, I was just telling her I was ok and making sure she wasn't freaking out in secret. She was taking the whole thing way too easy in my opinion.

I think she's a thrill junkie- I took her scuba diving for our first-year anniversary and some sharks showed up. Everyone else in the group nearly drowned each other trying to get back on the boat but Laura?

She kept her distance, but she was all in-she was so graceful-dancing around the fined menaces like it was nothing. When I finally pulled her out of the water she complained and wanted to keep going, started going on and on about shark bite statistics and how they ""never really bite"" and ""You were more likely to get mauled by a moose then bit by a shark.""

I love her but she's nuts when it comes to stuff like that. Me personally? I'm perfectly content staying in and watching the game-brew in hand. Anyway, I started cleaning up what was left of the hut, I was also sweating like a pig and nervously watching the tree line.

My mind was screwing with me; I was jumping at every little shadow and call echoing out from the swamp. Any time the bushes moved I'd freeze and raise a piece of cracked wood in my hand like a club.

I don't know what I thought I'd do against it but if I could jam the thing in an eye socket it would buy me sometime. By noon I had collapsed onto a beach chair- I had raked most of the fallen wires and stuff out of the pool and I just wanted to relax.

Unfortunately, God wanted to fuck with me personally- because it was that moment I heard thudding coming from the swamp. The tree line parted ways as the dinosaur emerged from the swamp. In the midnight sun I was able to get a clear look at the thing.

It was more wide than tall, only standing a few feet off the ground. The ridge gave off this brilliant yellow hue as the stripes traveled down the dino's spine and up its head. It formed a downward arrow at the base of the skull, pointing up the duck-billed maw. It was supporting its weight on all fours, talon-like arms caked in mud and what appeared to be dried blood.

The undercarriage of the dino was stone white and Scalley, like the belly of a croc. Its chainmail like scutes were too numerous to count, but varied in their shades as it traveled the length of this hulking beast. In its maw it carried a fresh kill- the bloody body of a whit-tailed doe lay limp in its grasp.

It was secured in a vice grip yet carried gently-like it didn't want to waste any part before it could safely eat at its den. The beast slumped forward- dipping a painted claw in the shallow end. It cooed like it was delighted and threw itself in pointing its maw to the sky to keep the well-earned meal dry.

It began to chew and chomp at the bits-a dog with his bone. I heard what was left of the deer's skeleton crack and splinter as the dino snapped its jaws-eager to spill the meat down its gullet. I turned away, grimacing as it feed.

I was halfway between the pool and backdoor-I'll give Laura this, she was right. The dino was completely ignoring me. Granted it had a fresh meal now. It swam to the edge of the deep and rested the deer carcass on the pool deck.

It raised itself up like it carefully, like it was sitting down at the dinner table, and grabbed each end and tore into it. I could hear flesh peeling away from shattered bone as it gleefully had its fill. Even as it feed- I could feel its emerald gaze out of the corner of its eye. Like it was daring me to try and take the meal.

Instead, I took my chair and scooted further away. After it was done it left what little remained to rot on the grass- and pulled away from the edge. It lazily drifted in the pool, aimlessly basking in the heat. It took notice of me once and-growled, I think. At least that's what I think that low guttural bellow meant when I tried to resume clean-up.

It also raised its log of a tail and splashed down-spraying me with ice cold water when I got too close. I jumped back and gasped, those icy droplets burned my tanned hide. I gave up and started to head back inside.

That's when I noticed a beige bucket hat bobbing up and down past the fence. My neighbor Ricky poked his head up and leaned over, a friendly smile etched on his fiery red face.

 ""Morning Sam! Lotta commotion this morning everything-"" He paused as he took notice of the leviathan lounging in the water. I thought he would take off screaming but instead he whistled at it in admiration. ""Well, I'll be damned-ya got Lucile in your yard. Awe that's quite an honor friend."" He offered. I Looked at him slack jawed. I ran up to him, frantically pointing at the monster evidently named ""Lucile."" 

""Rick, you look at that-that thing and then look me in the eyes. You're telling me that's normal?!?"" I shrieked at him. He simply shrugged. 

""Been a few years since she roamed this far in-but it's just Lucile. She's harmless-all things considered. Didn't Wayne give you the rundown when ya first moved in?"" he offered.

I recalled when the head of the HOA- a portly balding man who I vaguely remember being named Wayne- trying to give me a packet and explain some stuff. I assumed it was just a list of dues I'd pay later and by that point I was tired and rundown so I kind of kicked him to the curb.

In my defense I was really hungover and jetlagged, had a lot of unpacking to do. Hadn't heard a peep from him since. Like I said I tried to keep to myself-have a lot going on and I travel a lot for work.

I explained all this to Ricky who got a weird look on his face. He sheepishly stepped away from the fence and mumbled something.

""What was that?"" I snapped at him.

""Nothing Sam. Listen don't worry about Lucile-it's this damn heat its drawing all sorts of critters out of the woodwork. I got something mussing around my birdfeeder as well-know what I mean?"" He hinted. I was drawing a blank to be honest and stood silent.

""I'll give Wayne a shout and see if he can swing by at some point-he can probably explain it better than I can. You have a good day then buddy."" he flashed that southern charm at me than swaggered back to his house.

That was a couple days ago-and I am at my wits end now. ""Lucile"" has completely taken over my yard-she leaves animal carcass lying around, she lumbers around in the pool all damn day and night, and she snaps at me when I go near her.

I'm half tempted to lure her back into the swamp with a pile of sirloins or something like that-because I want my damn pool back. I told animal control there was a ""croc"" because who would believe it otherwise right?

Like I said before they came and ran almost immediately. No one in the neighborhood seems bothered by this, in fact I've had people try to come behind to get a photo of her like she's a novelty act. People go in Rick's yard, and I see them peering over the fence like peeping toms. I tell them to get lost and they get mean and snarky.

Am I the asshole here?

Everyone is just acting so damn nonchalant like this is an everyday thing its driving me up the wall. Laura has been texting me non-stop, bugging me for updates on what she's doing. She's stuck at her dorm for the rest of the week but every few minutes I get text from her.

It's kind of nice actually, we haven't talked like this in a couple months. I just wish we were talking about literally anything else. I'm not interested in where it came from- I just want to keep it out of my yard.

Wayne is supposed to stop by tomorrow and break it down for me but I'm not holding my breath for any quick solutions. I'll update if anything comes up but for now-does anyone had any ideas on how to reclaim my yard from this frigging dinosaur?",2,1752587847.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m0ifja,https://www.reddit.com/r/dcl/comments/1m0ifja/just_booked_our_first_cruise_and_so_excited_but/,Just Booked our First Cruise and so Excited - but now I have Questions,"My Husband and I just booked our first cruise ever and we are so excited. We don't have kids, but I love Disney and have always wanted to do a cruise but I don't love the idea of a hot cruise to the tropics on a huge Mega Ship or of getting off the boat and exploring on excursion day. I do love the idea of a beautiful, Disneyesque cruise with beautiful views bobbing past as I read my book ondeck/next to my stateroom portal and sip my hot cocoa, with modern amenities but with Disney vibes and old school cruise ship aesthetic.

So we've booked ourself a trip aboard the Disney Magic, for a 5 day Alaskan Cruise. It might be a little bit unorthodox, but we plan to enjoy some of the activities onboard/spend a lot of time reading, enjoying offline activities, the views, and the onboard glacier viewing day, while also planning to skip the off the boat excursion day. The boat seems so fun, and we're going for the Disney of it all, the incredible views, and the unstructured relaxation, you know? 

I have a few of questions and I'm having trouble finding the answers online, so I thought I'd ask here!

1. What on board the ship stays open on the 1 off the boat excursion day? If most people leave the boat this seems like a great time to window shop at the shops, or visit the ?waterpark? (Splash zone?)/AquaDunk, or enjoy the pools and hot tubs. 
2. I know ""the pastries are free"" (at Quiet Cove, right? Or is it somewhere else) and the fancy coffees are not. But is that specific to the cafe, or does the principle universally apply? Like is the food/snacks at the sportsbar/nightclubs also free and just the alcohol is paid? Or will everything, including soft drinks and lemonade, in those locations be an extra charge?
3. If I can't sleep or if I want to look at the stars, am I allowed to wander the boat? Or does it close at night? 
4. What is the boarding/disembarking process like on the first and last day?
6. The whats-included brochure did a good job of explaining the basics/large concepts of what's included in this all inclusive vacation, but not of explaining exactly what is and is not included. 
7. Is Palo worth it? I'm not sure I understand what makes different than the other restaurants other than the fact there's a charge to eat there. It must be different if they're doing that but all I know if it exists, offers brunch or dinner, and isn't included.
8. Since it's ""shoulder season"" and slightly cooler in May, will some things on the ship not be open? 
9. What other tips do you have for a first time cruiser?

I'm new here and very glad to find the space. I am relatively new to this and am super aware of how much I act at work to make others comfortable. 

So, at work, there needs to be a balance between talking about weather, coffee, kids I've never met, some contrived sports interest v. space aliens, the meaning of life, cool insects. 

I have tried so hard to fit in my whole life and I can get along easily with individuals but with groups? Forget it. This leaves me at a total disadvantage in Corporate America. The people I work with are pretty great, and I like 80% of them. Naturally, I want them to be comfortable when talking to me, but I don't want to be fake all the time because that's really depressing to maintain and ends up having really bad consequences like identity crisis or why did I wake up today.

I stick to normal conversation topics when people talk to me, unless there's an authentic moment and then people have deducted -- oh she's just a weirdo (which is fine I can do that role). When there are conversations typically with a bunch of women I die inside because I know when I leave that conversation I said something wrong, made someone uncomfortable, broke some rule that I didn't know about, or gave somebody some sort of Eldritch Horror based anxiety I had no idea existed because I spoke the wrong way. 😐

I'm a very open-minded, creative, warm person that likes to make people laugh and smile. I'm good at my job, usually and I try really hard to go the extra mile. The social stuff is killing me. 

I am totally confused as to who to go talk to, or what to say, or why I'm even going there, or what to talk about. I can ask for advice about a project that I'm working on, ask if they need help,  occasionally see if anybody wants to go get coffee, or hey, I brought some chocolate and I'd like to share. 

Other than that, I have no idea what to talk to people at work about if it's just about surface items. If I found it interesting it would be easier to figure out (YAY DHD). Does anybody have a good resource like a book, website, or even an IG feed  that shows you how to mask or what to do to make people comfortable when you exist in a group social (e.g. torture LOL) setting? 

I pass as normalish until I don't, then it's all over. I tended bar for time so I can fake a conversation for a minute. Doesn't work at a corporate office as you can't talk about anything fun. (Woo hoo, COPIES! I love copy machines... 😐)",1,1752587613.0,AuDHDWomen,0,1.0,False

Hey Travel Trotters! Just got back from the most epic adventure in Nuuk, Greenland, and I HAVE to share this hidden gem with you all! If you're looking for a truly unique destination off the typical tourist trail, this Arctic paradise should be at the top of your bucket list! 🧊🌄

## Museum Magic
Guys, the Greenland National Museum blew my mind! Despite being compact, it's packed with fascinating Inuit artifacts that tell the story of this incredible culture. The ancient mummies and traditional kayaks were absolutely mesmerizing. Pro tip: visit early in the day to avoid cruise ship crowds!

The Nuuk Art Museum is another must-see spot. I spent hours admiring works from local artists that blend traditional themes with modern techniques. I picked up a small print that now proudly hangs in my living room - best souvenir ever! 🎨

## Harbor Vibes
Don't miss a sunset stroll along Nuuk's iconic boardwalk! The light hitting the colorful buildings as fishing boats return to harbor created some of my most Instagram-worthy moments of the trip. 📸 

The historic harbor area is basically a postcard come to life. Those vibrant houses against the dramatic mountain backdrop? Perfection! Make sure to check out the ""Mother of the Sea"" sculpture and pop into Anori Art for authentic Greenlandic crafts. I found the cutest hand-carved tupilaks (traditional spiritual figures) there!

## Nature's Spectacles
OMG Travel Trotters - I SAW WHALES! 🐋 My 3-hour tour with Nuuk Water Taxi delivered big time. We spotted several humpbacks feeding in the fjord, and they came so close to our boat! The captain was super knowledgeable about marine life and conservation efforts.

If you can visit during shoulder season (late August-September or March-April), you might catch the Northern Lights! I was lucky enough to witness those magical green swirls dancing across the night sky. No filter could ever do it justice - it's something you need to experience in person. ✨

## Panoramic Paradise
For the BEST views of the city, hike up to Myggedalen viewpoint! The trail isn't too challenging, and the panorama of the bay with colorful houses dotting the landscape is absolutely worth the effort. Bring a thermos of coffee and some snacks to enjoy at the top - I spent nearly two hours just soaking in the views.

## Fjord Exploring
The boat tour through the surrounding fjords was hands-down the highlight of my trip! I booked with Greenland Arctic Xplorers for a full-day adventure, and we cruised past towering icebergs, hidden waterfalls, and even spotted some reindeer along the shore. The silence out there is something I've never experienced before - just the occasional crack of ice and gentle lapping of water against the boat. Pure magic! ⛰️ 🚤

## Food Finds
You guys know I travel for food, and Nuuk surprised me with its culinary scene! Kunguak Café serves an AMAZING musk ox burger that completely changed my life. It's like the best beef you've ever had but with a unique, slightly gamey flavor.

Restaurant Unicorn (yes, really!) was my splurge night, and their reindeer steak with local berries was worth every penny. After dinner, hit up Daddy's for locally brewed beers - the Arctic Pale Ale was my favorite after a day of exploring!

## Practical Tips
- Pack layers! Even in summer, temperatures can drop quickly
- Credit cards are widely accepted, but having some Danish Krone is helpful
- Book accommodation early - options are limited
- English is commonly spoken, but learning a few Greenlandic phrases earns major points with locals
- WiFi is available but can be spotty, so download offline maps
- Most attractions are walkable, but taxis are available for longer distances

## The Verdict
Nuuk might not be the easiest destination to reach, but that's part of its charm. This remote capital offers a perfect blend of cultural immersion, natural wonders, and urban comforts without the crowds of more touristy Arctic destinations.

I spent 5 days there and feel like I barely scratched the surface. Already planning my return trip for winter to experience dog sledding and the polar night! ❄️🐕

Punish?? Bro, this isn’t a TED talk. Your son isn’t bold, he’s entitled. and you’re enabling it. Teaching him that strangers owe him whatever he asks for is a great way to raise a future problem, not a confident adult.

## Key Features Analysis

The best Thirstystone coasters of 2025 boast several key features that differentiate them from standard coasters.

**Absorbent Stone Material:** Thirstystone coasters are renowned for their use of natural absorbent stone. This material, often sandstone or a similar porous rock, provides excellent absorption capabilities. The stone effectively wicks away moisture from beverage containers, preventing water rings and protecting furniture surfaces.The natural variations in the stone also add a unique touch to each coaster, ensuring no two are exactly alike.

**Variety of Designs and Patterns:** The aesthetic appeal of Thirstystone coasters is a significant selling point. They are available in a vast range of designs, from simple geometric patterns to intricate artwork and licensed images. This variety ensures there is a Thirstystone coaster to match any decor style, whether it be modern, rustic, or traditional. The designs are often permanently printed or etched onto the stone, ensuring they won't fade or peel over time.**Cork Backing:** To prevent scratching and slippage, Thirstystone coasters typically feature a cork backing. this provides a soft,non-abrasive surface that protects furniture from damage. The cork also helps the coaster stay firmly in place, preventing accidental spills from jostling. This small but vital detail contributes significantly to the overall usability and lifespan of the coasters.

**Diameter and Thickness:** Standard Thirstystone coasters typically measure around 4 inches in diameter, providing ample surface area for most standard glasses and mugs. Their thickness, usually between 0.25 and 0.3 inches, adds to their durability and stability.

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean Thirstystone coasters?**
To clean Thirstystone coasters, gently scrub them with a soft brush or cloth using warm water and a mild dish soap. For stubborn stains, use a paste of baking soda and water, letting it sit for a few minutes before rinsing. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners,as they can damage the stone.

**Are Thirstystone coasters heat resistant?**
While Thirstystone coasters are excellent at absorbing moisture, they are not designed to withstand high temperatures. Placing hot mugs or dishes directly on the coasters can cause them to crack or discolor. It is indeed best to use trivets or other heat-resistant surfaces for hot items.

**Do Thirstystone coasters prevent condensation from forming on the table?**
Yes, the absorbent stone material of Thirstystone coasters effectively soaks up condensation from cold drinks. This prevents moisture from reaching the table surface and causing water rings or other damage. The coasters are designed to trap the condensation, keeping your furniture dry and protected.

1m0iasm,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m0iasm/my_life_flashed_before_my_eyes_i_think_i_saw_my/,My life flashed before my eyes. I think I saw my death,"Have you ever had a near death experience? I mean like a moment, maybe two, where you just kind of think to yourself, “this is it. This is how I die,” but for whatever reason, you’re still here, breathing, and reading this post? What was that moment like? Were you scared, at peace, or maybe even angry? Maybe you were just plain sad. I know it’s not any of my business, “curiosity killed the cat,” or whatever. I guess I’m just asking because I have died, though I didn’t even know it till just a few hours ago. I guess I’m asking because I want to find people similar to me, and to hear your stories as well. Sorry, I suppose I ought to be more considerate of other people’s traumatic experiences. Not everyone is willing to turn to the internet with all their deepest darkest thoughts and just say, “hey! I don’t need a therapist! Let me just put this online for everyone to see!” I suppose with all the stories some people could tell, we’re better off that they keep it between them and corporate contracts of the mind doctors. Some things it’s best we just don’t know.

It all started a long long time ago..not actually, I’ve just always wanted to say that. It started this morning when I decided to go out fishing with my wife. Not that my wife fishes, but we’re on our honeymoon at the moment-living it up at a beautiful home in the middle of nowhere, Montana. We were married at home in New Mexico, but we both really love woodlands, the snow, and the mountains. Two of those things you DEFINITELY don’t get in New Mexico. So, when I was scouting a place for us to stay after our wedding, I found a dainty little cabin in the mountains of Montana. The place wasn’t expensive per se, but it wasn’t a steal either. Anything for the Mrs. 

We arrived in Montana with both of us way too exhausted to enjoy the view. We flew most of the way, but unsurprisingly when a couple of hung over newlyweds used to flat lands and straight roads get into the winding mountain roads of MT, they’re bound to find a way to get lost. That to say, it was half past 2 by the time we finally made it to our cute little cabin. It wasn’t quite as nice as the pictures online made it out to be, but maybe that’s just because it was dark out. I didn’t care, and neither did Elaina. We both just wanted a hot shower and cool sheets. I don’t much remember the events of that night like some lovebirds do with their honeymoon. If I had to guess, we went through our night routine like zombies till we went from living dead to just plain dead and passed out on the mattress.

I do, however, remember that afternoon. This afternoon, actually. I don’t think today is one I’ll be forgetting any time soon, as much as I may pray to God that I do. 

We woke up at the same time. It was like something out of a movie-the feeling of my wife on my chest, the sun piercing through the opened shades of the bedroom window, and the birds tweeting outside. The cabin itself had this piney smell to it that just added to the serenity of everything. So, Elaina and I just sat there for a while and didn’t say a word. We had two weeks to ourselves in this quiet place away from our busy lives at home so why not just stretch, lay back, and enjoy it for a while? There’s no rush, we’ve got plenty of time. I stroke Elaina’s raven black hair as she tells me good morning in her cracked, I-just-woke-up voice. She’s always been the cutest when she’s just waking up. 

I really did get lucky with her. She’s a drop dead gorgeous woman and I’m a shrimp born with all kinds of defects. A few years of surgeries helped me out a bit, but I’m still a small man with a thin frame. Alaina has always been bigger than me, but it doesn’t bother either of us.

After we each exchange a good morning and make sure the other is well rested, we stay put for a few minutes longer before I finally stand up out of bed. Elaina objects, but overrules it herself when I mention brewing coffee for us. I dig my robe and slippers out from my suitcase, and head to the front of the house with a yawn. The slippers make sounds like a flip flop as I walk. They’re not quite small enough for me, so the heels slap the ground with each step. It’s always been difficult for me to find clothes my size since I’m too proud to wear children’s clothes. As I exit the hall, I enter the combined living room, dining room, and kitchenette. I remember finally seeing the cabin lit up by the rays from the sun. The room had no shortage of windows so the light was able to enter from almost every angle. The natural illumination made the blur of a home from yesterday seem like a professionally taken picture that you’d see online or in some magazine at a doctor’s office. It wasn’t the cabin that made everything so picturesque and perfect, but the view of the Rocky Mountains sitting just outside and beyond my front porch. The caps of the mountains are painted with pearly snow that oozes down from the very tops till it melts away into stripes like a zebra’s back. The mountains themselves are a mixture of grey and blue that contrast the familiar reds and browns of home. The stony faces seem to have been carved out by angels-angels who laid their creations into a bed of greens and earthy browns. The trees, the blanket of the mountains, stand straight and tall as they rise and fall like dunes thanks to their diverse heights and sizes. Perhaps most striking to me is the water.  Amidst all the beauty of my new front yard, the centerpiece is a lake of the most beautiful water I’ve ever seen. The mountains, the trees, the hills, they all make a bowl with the lake in the center. 

Oh to describe the lake. Simply saying, “it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before,” wouldn’t do justice. Having said that, I can’t truthfully think of any other way to describe it. I could tell you how the colors of bright and deep blue made me feel like I was looking at some unearthly crystal. The shades were similar to a hot spring, but with the emerald tint of nature. I could tell you how even the sand lining its shore was so white it may as well have been snow from the mountains above. What I will tell you is that even if I didn’t notice it the first time I saw it, the most striking feature of the picture perfect water was that even as the trees shook gently in the wind, the water seemingly refused to move.

My trance was interrupted by the ding of the coffee pot. What kind of coffee pot dings anyway? With that thought, I fix my wife and I some coffee before heading back to bed. I glance at the clock on my way back, “2:12.” That’s what we get for staying up so late.

The afternoon was uneventful. Elaina and I sipped our coffee as we chatted about nothing in particular. It was nice getting to enjoy the slow life and take a break from our otherwise busy, nonstop lives. Eventually, I decided I want to go fishing. I grab my rod and tackle from our car, and in my finest dad cargo shorts I wade out into the water. My steps send ripples that break the calmness, and I think that’s when I realized just how still the water really was. Maybe I did get a good deal on this place after all. While pondering my good luck, I cast my line to a more central part of the lake-hoping that said luck carries over to my fishing. It’s not long before I get a bite, and the tugging of my prey sends throngs of joy through my whole body. Excitedly I begin to reel in my catch, but as soon as I do all resistance dissipates. Maybe the timing is a little odd but I’ve gotten false bites before. I didn’t reel my line in much so I leave it where it is and wait for the next bite. I stand still, and soon the calmness of the water has returned; enveloping my legs from the thigh down. Elaina sits on her sunbathing towel which she has placed on the sandy shores behind me and watches. She doesn’t know how to fish, but I’m grateful to have found a girl who will at least pretend to share my interests. Oh so very grateful.

I feel another tug on the line. I begin to pull and reel but I get the same result as last time. Ok, either these are the smartest fish I’ve ever seen or this lake is inhabited by loose gripped twigs. I reel in my line to make sure everything is still in good shape and to my surprise, the bait is gone. My only hope is that a fish was smart enough to steal a bite to eat as opposed to some piece of debris under the water taking it just to be annoying. I bait my line, and cast again. Maybe two seconds after I throw my hook out into the water in a different place from the prior two times, the tugging comes again. I wait a moment and lightly pull against the line to assure that whatever I’m fighting against is living, and not some inanimate object. The wrestling against my line persists, so I slowly start to reel it in. In accordance with the other attempts, the fish halts its efforts immediately and I reel in a baitless hook. 

Now I’m starting to get a little frustrated. I’m blowing through my limited amount of bait, and there’s no way I’m leaving this cabin to go buy more. I don’t even want to think about how far the nearest store with fishing bait may be. I look back at Elaina who gives me a sad smile. She has no idea what’s going on, but she can feel my annoyance and offers her usual look to tell me that, “everything will be just fine.” I turn back to the water to see that my bobber has completely disappeared. I follow the fishing line with my eyes to see that it’s hanging loosely in the small waves of the beautiful lake water, but no red and white bobber. I’m not alarmed by this, but I exit the lake carefully in order to make sure of my footing. My bare feet find good holds before I take my next step, and I make it out with only a few small scrapes from stones and sticks. “What kind of fish eats the bobber?” I can’t help but be irritated as I trudge along and towards the shore to where Elaina lay sunbathing. I give her a small smile, the best I can do. She’s as beautiful as ever but what man doesn’t find his wife extra beautiful in her swimsuit? As I soak in the view of Elaina, my face quickly turns from a husband’s smile to alarmed confusion. My wife is standing on her towel, her hands outstretched to me. Her face is contorted into a look of abject terror and it takes me by surprise. Her mouth hangs wide open as if she was shouting, but no sound emanates from her perfect lips. Her long hair is behind her, flowing in wind that doesn’t exist, yet standing still as though it had been frozen mid wave. She doesn’t even blink as she reaches for me. 

Elaina is stuck in place. I look around, but only my eyes can move. In similarity to my wife’s hair, I notice the leaves on trees are also stuck in place. They all faced an unnatural angle like the breeze started and stopped, but the trees missed the memo and held their places. I attempted to open my mouth to call out to Elaina, but my teeth were stuck together and I couldn’t move my mouth at all. I try to walk forward but my legs are stuck as well. The water holds me in place and I begin to panic as my situation sets in. I had experienced sleep paralysis once before, and this made me think of that moment. Even in sleep paralysis, the world around you moves. I’m not sure if that’s more or less terrifying than everything stopping altogether. 

Even though my panic is growing, my heart rate doesn’t change. Actually, I can’t even feel my heart beating in my chest. Come to think of it, I’m not breathing either. “What’s going on? Am I dreaming? I can’t be dreaming, I know I’m awake. Do I know I’m awake? Wait, what’s that?” I watch ahead of me intently as I try to process what I see. In between my wife and I, a small red and white fishing bobber has appeared, and now sits between us suspended in mid air. I know for a fact that it wasn’t there before, but it’s not like a piece of tackle floating before my eyes is normal whether it was there before or not. 

The bobber begins to move. It hovers towards me slowly. Instinctively I try to avoid it-to duck, step out of the way, anything, but I still can’t move a muscle. The bobber stops in front of me before doing yet another unexplainable thing. In a voice that isn’t English, but a language I somehow understand, the bob speaks to me. The voice with which it spoke was unholy, yet smooth and very refined. 

“Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.”

The voice rang like music in my ears. All at once I wanted to cry, I wanted to scream in terror and delight, and I wanted to die. The sound of it speaking overpowered me, and I felt as though I may cease to be for simply hearing its words.

I stood helplessly before the thing, such a small and strange thing, and it began to move once again. This time, it didn’t stop until it made contact with my forehead. I can recall so vividly the warmth and pulsating of it as if it was alive. It was not an affectionate touch, but it remained there for a moment as though it meant to hold a kiss. I remember my vision getting hazy as I fell backwards into the crystal sea.

Do you spend hours tweaking prompts, only to end up with generic or lackluster results? You’re not alone. The secret to unlocking the full potential of AI image generation lies in the art of the prompt, and we’re here to show you how to master it.

https://preview.redd.it/azv0jz75m1df1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=49f0e6f6aebcf027f7a040db4bee9c581d18e8ef

# The Problem with Vague Prompts

We’ve all been there. You have a brilliant idea for a CGI ad or a piece of digital art, but your prompts are too simple. “A cup of coffee,” “a futuristic car,” or “a beautiful landscape” might give you a starting point, but they won’t produce the professional-grade, hyper-realistic images you’re aiming for. The result? Frustration, wasted time, and a portfolio that doesn’t reflect your true creative vision.

# The Solution: Precision-Engineered Prompts

To get extraordinary results, you need extraordinarily detailed prompts. Think of it as the difference between giving a painter a vague idea and handing them a detailed blueprint. The more specific you are, the better the outcome. A well-crafted prompt should include:

•Technical Lighting Details: Specify the type of lighting (e.g., three-point studio lighting), the angle, and the color temperature (in Kelvin) to create a specific mood.

•Advanced Camera Specs: Define the camera angle, lens type (focal length), and depth of field (f-stop) to control the composition and focus.

•Material and Texture Specifics: Describe the surfaces in your scene with details like “weathered oak,” “brushed aluminum,” or “subsurface scattering” for realistic light interaction.

# Prompts That Solve Your Problems

Let’s look at a few examples of how detailed prompts can solve common creative challenges:

1.The Lifeless Product Shot: Instead of “a can of soda,” try this prompt for a “Premium Beverage Ad”:

2.The Generic Tech Ad: Instead of “a smartphone,” use this prompt for a “Futuristic Smartphone Launch”:

3.The Uninspired Fashion Image: Instead of “a handbag,” try this prompt for a “Designer Handbag Showcase”:

# Your Shortcut to Stunning CGI

These prompts are more than just ideas; they are your technical shortcut to creating breathtaking CGI visuals. They eliminate the guesswork, streamline your workflow, and empower you to produce the kind of high-quality content that will make your portfolio shine.

There is one thing I definitely don't want and that is to be stuck in the cruise ship crowds... In fact, I want to avoid towns were cruise ships dock (e.g., Seward, Whittier...)  I want to avoid as much as I can being part of the ""over tourism"" problem some communities face.  I lived in a small city for years that is a tourism hotspot and totally get the problem over tourism can cause...

We are thinking of a trip of around 10 days with two main stops - one to a seaside town and one more in the interior...  We love hikes and the outdoor experience (I would go on 10 mile plus day hikes, my wife is more of a 5 mile max with a coffee shop nearby!)

1m0i9l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m0i9l2/does_the_ninja_cfp301_coffee_maker_redefine/,Does the Ninja CFP301 Coffee Maker Redefine Specialty Brewing?,"I’ve been using the Ninja CFP301 coffee maker for a while now, and it’s safe to say that this machine has made mornings a lot more bearable, especially for someone like me who runs on caffeine. This coffee maker, also known as the DualBrew Pro, isn’t just another appliance on your counter—it’s a multi-functional beast designed to cater to all your coffee needs. It’s a drip coffee maker at heart, but it somehow feels like a coffeehouse snuck into my kitchen. That said, there are some quirks to consider if you’re thinking about adding this to your collection.

**Sleek Design and Compact Dimensions**  
Stepping into the aesthetic zone, the coffee maker has a modern, black design with clean lines that fit well into any kitchen setup. It’s not overly bulky at 15.5 inches tall and 9.1 inches wide, meaning it doesn’t dominate your counter like some larger models. Despite packing a lot of features, it’s surprisingly space-efficient. The glass carafe included feels sturdy, and the entire build screams durability even though it’s primarily constructed of plastic.

**Versatile Brewing Features**  
The flexibility of this coffee maker is its biggest appeal. It’s compatible with both coffee grounds and pods, covering a spectrum of brewing needs. Whether you want a quick K-Cup coffee or prefer grinding your beans for that extra freshness, this machine has you covered. The nine brewing sizes for coffee grounds range from a small cup to a full carafe, while the pod options include sizes from 6 oz to 12 oz. Additionally, the four brewing styles—Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty—provide immense variety. I personally love the “Over Ice” feature for iced coffee enthusiasts like me, as it brews a concentrated coffee that doesn’t get watered down.

[See Ninja CFP301 deals on Amazon now.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0btp84qm5/)

**Milk Frother for Specialty Coffees**  
For anyone obsessed with café-style drinks, the built-in milk frother earns some major points. Whether I’m making a quick cappuccino or experimenting with a macchiato, it’s incredibly easy to whip up frothy milk. It folds away neatly when not in use, which adds to the thoughtful design of the machine. Though the frother works as intended, I found it a bit less powerful than standalone frothers, requiring a bit of patience to get that perfect froth.

**Independent Hot Water System**  
This additional feature caught me by surprise. The separate hot water system comes in handy for instant soups, oatmeal, or hot cocoa. With two temperature settings—hot and boil—it’s got you covered for more than just coffee. Since it operates independently, I can make a quick cup of tea without worrying about any residual coffee flavors mixing in. It’s a lifesaver on cold days when all I want is a steaming bowl of instant ramen.

**Faster Brewing Time for Pods**  
The appliance brews K-Cup pods faster than some leading Keurig models, living up to its claim. I timed it multiple times to see if the hype was real, and indeed, it took less time to get my pod coffee ready in the morning. That’s a small win for someone who dashes out the door with seconds to spare.

**Positives**  
- Dual coffee system for pods and grounds  
- Compact, space-efficient design  
- Frother feature for specialty drinks  
- Separate hot water system for versatility  

**Bad Points**  
- The frother could use more power  
- Slightly noisy during larger brews  
- Plastic build may not appeal to everyone  

**Competing Products**  
While the Ninja CFP301 offers a variety of features, it does have competitors like the Keurig K-Duo and Breville Bambino. The Keurig K-Duo, for instance, offers similar grounds and pod compatibility but feels limited in brewing styles. Additionally, the Bambino focuses solely on espresso drinks and lacks versatility for drip coffee. Where the Ninja excels is its broad spectrum of brewing options combined with added functionalities like the independent hot water system—something its competitors don’t typically feature.

**Quality for Price**  
Given the versatility, I think this coffee maker strikes a fantastic balance between quality and cost. Features like the frother, different brewing sizes, and speed make it worth the investment if you take coffee seriously. Though it’s not the cheapest model out there, it offers enough customization and longevity to justify the price point.

Like the title said Im lazy and I don’t know how to fix it.

I don’t like to do hard things and I don’t know how to fix it. To the simplest terms of I don’t even like to carry heavy things when we’re moving apartments, I put the bare minimum in at work, i want save money and lower my spending so  I budget and I don’t follow it because my brain gets more  dopamine from impulse spending than it does saving. I want a clean and cute  apartment but I never clean consistently, and I buy decor but I never put it up and so now my home is just somewhere I hate being.


I have this idea of a life I want and nothing I do pushes me toward that life and I can’t find the motivation to start.  

When I imagine my life I want I want a cute/clean apartment. Decorated to make me happy, with a dinner table that’s not covered in junk and I actually make breakfast everyday and drink my coffee at the actual table, and I actually get up early enough to do it. I want to go to the gym and do things that should make me feel good. I want to meal prep and spend my days productively instead of just lazing around. 

My one partner is the king of self discipline they have rules for themselves and they just follow them. Cleaning every night, no tv or video games on weeknights in bed by 9 they have a huge savings and they don’t touch and they just follow those rules. (We live separately, luckily for them) I make rules for myself and they last a day or two maybe before I lose track and give up.

However, I'm at that age where everybody I know is either too busy or lazy to go out or do anything. 

Stuff we can together:

* **Play music**: I'm a guitarist and dabble in different genres, mainly metal, rock, jazz, and traditional Irish/Scottish (I can play the tin whistle as well).
* **Go to gigs**: Lots of cool local and (rarely) international acts play in nice venues in downtown Cairo.
* **Watch obscure movies**: I'm not into block busters but I'm always open to watching some hidden gems that not a lot people know about.
* **Read and discuss great books**, book club style.
* **Work out together**: weightlifting, bodyweight workouts, running, swimming, or even boxing/kickboxing/Muai Thai.
* **Hiking**: I love discovering new trails, especially when it involves mountains.
* **Travel**: locally or internationally. Europe has loads of great destinations. I've also always wanted to visit the US; I have the visa but haven't had the chance to go yet.
* **Scuba diving**: I'm a certified open water diver and would love to go diving more frequently in different locations. Also interested in pursuing advanced courses.
* **Practice languages**: I'm really into language learning and have managed to teach myself a few to varying degrees of fluency. If you study or speak French, German, Mandarin Chinese, or Japanese, please hit me up!
* **Cooking/baking**: I'm a proficient home cook and always happy to invite people to sample my recipes. I'm particularly interested in international cuisine (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Italian, etc.). I've built my home kitchen from scratch and have everything I need to cook virtually anything.

Bonus points if you're into coffee, combat sports, motorcycles, old cars, sailing, pipe/cigar smoking, or whisky. I'm not super into gaming or manga/anime but I'd be definitely be open to exploring.

Age, gender, and nationality aren't very important to me. I'm based in October/Zayed area, so hopefully you're not very far outside Cairo/Giza.

Once I got access to food after I started earning, I veered towards meat as much as possible. By the time I reached the age of 35, I was marinating meat and keeping it in the freezer to eat a small quantity with each of my meals. I stay away from harming animals as much as is possible, I think twice before even killing an ant. But when it came to food, I was addicted.
 
It didn't work that well. I was rapidly gaining weight and entered the obesity range. I did suffer from a lot of vitamin deficiencies and needed supplements. My skin was not very healthy. 

I had been following this sub for a few months and one day it just clicked. I still had the chicken I had marinated. I decided it'll be my last piece. I wanted to turn vegan. 

Started it by becoming vegetarian first. I was addicted to tea and coffee and so was still consuming dairy and largely stopped eating meat. I did relapse twice in two months because I was still not used to cooking properly and needed something tasty. But over the months, I have learnt SO MUCH about nutrition that I never bothered to learn. I am taking multivitamin supplements.

 I mostly eat rice and lentils along with atleast one vegetable and spinach cooked in a simple manner, sometimes just fried with some salt. Then some nuts, mostly walnut. Other times I eat wheat bread with some curry. I have turned to black tea and coffee. My food has so much variety now. 

I feel so energetic, light and full. It's amazing. My skin has improved and weight has improved. My mood is better. ",3,1752587093.0,vegan,3,0.8,False

To protect the identities of the dead I’ll just call my friends Tom, Dick and Harry. Me, You can call John, we’d known each other since the 3rd grade and always been thick as thieves. 


The year this all happened, the stars had aligned, and we were all free for the Memorial Day weekend. So we decided to drive a few miles north of where we live to go camping in a small state park. 


We loaded up Tom’s car with supplies and grabbed a cooler full of hot dogs and beer before setting out, and by sunset, we were all ready for a great weekend. 


That was when he arrived. 


He was a tall, clean-shaven man dressed in a polo shirt and khakis who smiled like a painted doll. Almost at once, I noticed a bruise on his forehead that looked pretty nasty. He stepped out from the treeline just as we were settling down to eat and startled us half to death. 


It was a public campsite, but slightly out of the way, so we hadn’t really expected anyone to walk through. Still, he wasn’t doing anything wrong, so we just nodded and waved when he looked at us. 


“Hey guys!” He bounded over, “My name’s Dave, don’t you just love camping!” As he spoke, he stuck out his hand to shake, that too wide grin never faltering. 


“Uh yeah,” I muttered awkwardly, accepting his hand, which, despite the manic force he applied to everything else, was a limp, wet fish of a handshake. 


“Nice car!” He nodded towards Tom’s old station wagon, “Who’s it insured with?” 


“What?” Tom asked, somewhere between confused and annoyed. 


“I’m sorry!” The man, Dave, laughed. “I sell auto policies for Polidyne Insurance, can’t seem to turn it off when I’m not at work!” 


“Right…” Tom was looking around, bewildered. “So, we were just making dinner.” He left that hanging, hoping Dave would take a hint, but the man just blinked at us vacantly. We were all a bit drunk now, but still we eyed each other nervously as he sat down on the other side of the fire. The smoke was blowing that way, and he must have been getting a face full of it, but he didn’t show it. 


We all sat dumbfounded for a while before Harry reached into the cooler and pulled out a hot dog and put it on a stick. Shrugging at the rest of our dirty looks, he handed it to Dave and asked, “You want some food?” 


“Sure!” Dave said, his grin unmoving on his face. 


We all looked around at each other nervously as he cooked the sausage and put it into a bun Harry slid his way. “Do you boys have any mayonnaise?” He asked, looking at us. 


“Yeah,” I muttered, tossing him a bottle. 


“Great!” He exclaimed as if I had given him the meaning of life, “Mayonnaise is the sauce of the aristocrat, you know?” This bizarre statement was punctuated by him dumping an unpleasant amount of the white sauce onto the hot dog and proceeding to eat it in two bites. Leaving ugly white smears around his face. It was then, staring at him in disgust, that I noticed the bruise on his forehead was gone. That wasn’t possible, I rationalized that it had to have been a trick of the light. 

“What does that even mean?” Asked Tom looking slightly green at his table manners. Dave only looked at him and slowly blinked as if he hadn’t understood the question before swallowing the last bite of his sausage. 


“Look man” Dick straightened up, he had had the most to drink out of all of us. Which is probably why he’d let it go this far, but I could tell from his tone he was beyond annoyed. “We came up here to camp with our friends for a weekend, we don’t know you. So please leave” his jaw was tight as he spoke, and I watched, waiting for a fight, unsure if I would help him or pull him off  


Dave only nodded, looking slightly sad, and said, “Of course, I don’t mean to be a bother. If any of you are looking for a new insurance policy, however, you know where to find me!” With that, he walked away down the dirt path towards the rest of the campsites. As he walked, I noticed there was dirt and sticks on the back of his clothes as if he had been lying down in the woods. 



“Okay,” Tom hissed, looking around at the rest of us, “what the hell was that about?” 


“I dunno” Dick slurred drunkenly, a menacing glint in his eyes “but he better not show up at our camp again if he knows what’s good for him” 


“Okay Dick, calm down” Harry said placatingly. He’s probably just lonely. 


“Lonely my ass” Dick muttered darkly. “There’s something wrong about that guy.” 


I didn’t speak, but I knew what he meant. I couldn’t put a finger on it, but something about Dave had been extremely wrong in a subtle way. Not just an awkward dude who didn’t understand social norms, but genuinely wrong. 


“Did any of you guys notice he never blinked?” Tom asked after a moment's pause, and I realized he was right, in all the time he had sat in that smoke. He hadn’t blinked once. 


Hours passed as the fire burned down and the beer drained away, eventually leaving me alone in the early morning dark. Tom and Dick had hit the booze hardest and gone to bed hours ago and Harry had just left to brush his teeth at the small cinderblock bathroom a little ways across the camping area. I would have gone with him, but somehow I didn’t want to leave the camp unguarded with weird Dave around. 


So I was relieved when Harry came walking back into camp. Then, as he got close, I noticed how pale he was, as pale as a ghost. 


“You okay?” I asked, jumping to my feet, and grabbed his arm to steady him. 


“Yeah,” he muttered, “just saw something weird is all”


“Dave?” I asked, pointedly looking around as if expecting to see him grinning from the wood line. 


“What?” Harry asked confused, then seemed to shake himself, “No, nothing like that, it was some kind of animal, I think. I just caught a glimpse of it as it ran across the road. But it looked wrong,” I tried to push, but he wouldn’t or couldn’t explain more, and eventually I let him go to bed and started making my own way towards the bathroom. I carried my big flashlight with me in case I saw whatever had spooked Harry and played it around the campsites as I walked. A few tents and a couple RVs were dotted around, but mostly the site was deserted, unusual because this was a holiday. 


Then I saw it. Running across the road, maybe 20 yards in front of me, at first I thought it was a dog, but it didn’t move right. I swung my flashlight around and managed to catch just a momentary view of it, and I understood why Harry had looked so scared. It was about the size of a large dog and hairless. That wasn’t the creepy part; the creepy part was how it moved, almost spider-like. Startled, I stepped back, almost tripping when I felt a hand catch my elbow and steady me. It was Dave. 


“Hey, watch your feet. Don’t want you getting hurt!” This close, I noticed a few things about him, one was that his eyes were not only unblinking but dull and unfocused. Immediately, my mind went to drugs, which would also explain his odd behavior. The other thing I noticed was how cold his skin was. It was a warm night, but he seemed almost chilled. 

“Hey, uh… thanks,” I stammered, straightening myself. Before I turned back and ran the flashlight across the road. 


“Did you see that animal?” I asked Dave, not for any reason but because it was easier than standing there with him in silence. Less creepy. 


Or so I thought until he answered, saying “that’s not an animal” in a warning, almost urgent voice. There was something in his eyes that had not been there before, but only for an instant before the dull look returned


“Not an animal,” I stammered, “then what is it?” It had looked like, I don’t know what. Pink and fleshy was all I could say for sure. 


“I don’t know,” Dave said cheerfully “but if it damages your friends vehicle my company offers a great deal on all inclusive insurance if you bundle your home and auto policies with us” his grin shone white in the moonlight, as he made the rambling sales pitch and I had had enough of him. So, turning, I just walked away down the road. I made it to the bathroom and brushed my teeth, but when I went to leave the building and head back to camp, to my horror, Dave was standing right outside the door.


He didn’t say anything, just smiled at me, unmoving. In the light from the bathroom, I got a better view of him now, and instantly noticed that he seemed somehow bulkier than before. As if he had gained weight around his midsection. But that didn’t make sense, it had to be a trick of the light or something tied around his wrist under his shirt, perhaps. 


“What’s your problem!?” I shouted, fear creeping into my voice now. 


“No problems, we at Polidyne make insurance easy,” he spoke with the same faux-friendly salesman's voice as before, but he sounded different. Sluggish and slurring his words, almost drunk. I was sure then that he was on drugs. Angrily, I just pushed past him, walking back to my camp. When I got there, I crawled into my sleeping bag and went to sleep. 


It was probably around 2 am when I fell asleep, so I didn’t wake up until close to noon. When I did, I found the rest of my friends already up and nursing hangovers. 


Surprisingly I felt fine, I hadn’t gone as hard as Dick last night but I had kept up with the others fine. We had a full day in the park, and then one more night before we drove back, and despite how weird the whole situation with Dave had been, I was determined to make the best of it. 


“So, guys, what do you want to do?” 


“Head down to the lake?” Harry asked, gesturing with his chin towards a path leading into the woods a little way from our tent. 


“I’d rather hike up the mountain,” Tom said, shrugging, “but I’m good with whatever.” 

Dick just grunted, and took a deep pull from a coffee mug. 


A little worried after everything that had happened yesterday, I got the guys to help me load all our valuables into the locked car, and then we set off for the lake. It was actually three lakes, one roughly V-shaped and the other two like “I”s they appeared from a distance, almost like four claw marks in the earth. Which I supposed was why they were called the Bear Claw Lakes. They were cool and emerald green, reflecting the colors of the trees and sky and sparkling in the sun. The sort of place that makes you want to jump in and swim from just the sight of it. 


We spent a great few hours messing around, jumping off the rocks, and pushing each other in, and although around 4 pm, it started to lose its luster, it would have been a great day had it ended there. Tired, we began to make our way back up the winding trail to the campsite. 


The campsite had been completely trashed, as we stood dumbfounded where the fire had been the night before, and looked around at the slashed tent and upturned cooler. 


“Should we call the Rangers?” Harry wondered aloud


“No cell reception out here, we’ll have to drive” Tom said absently crouching down to examine a rip in one of the tents. 


“I’m gonna kill that damned salesman!” Dick yelled, kicking an empty can into the woods out of frustration. 


It wasn’t just Dick, everyone immediately blamed Dave, even Harry, who always assumed the best about everyone, but somehow I didn’t think so. The image of that pink fleshy thing the night before, I couldn’t get it out of my mind. It hadn’t been a dog, and I think Dave had been right about it not being an animal either. At least not a “wild” animal. I had only caught a glimpse of it, but what it had looked like to me was a person…


A person moving on all fours with something seriously wrong with their joints. I had never been superstitious, but something about that… thing had given me the heebie-jeebies in a way that had grown stronger the more time passed since I’d seen it.  


And that’s when I noticed the… thing, I don’t know what to call it, hanging from the tree. It was made from a beer can taken from our cooler, the metal cut and flattened out like a sheet of paper, then folded origami style into a small figure of a man, his limbs bent at odd angles. He was tied with twine at the center of a triangle of sticks and hung from the nearest tree to the campsite, slowly twisting back and forth in the breeze, the metal glinting in the light of the evening sun. 


The thought of finding and confronting Dave flashed through my mind, but what would be the point? 


“Let’s just go, guys,” I said, pointing towards Tom’s car. They all nodded clearly, uncomfortable to spend any more time here.  


When we all climbed into the car, it wouldn’t start. Now, in a story, this is where everyone would have panicked, but there had been a few other campers around this morning, and whatever was wrong, we all assumed it could be fixed. Or at least that we could get a ride to a mechanic. So we didn’t worry much as we opened the hood to check the engine. 


The battery was missing, and looking under the car, we found the fuel line had been cut,  or on closer inspection, seemingly chewed through by something. So leaving Tom and Dick to work on the car, and watch what was left of our stuff. Harry and I went to find another camper who could help us. 


But there were none, the campsite was completely deserted now. With all the other guests seemingly having left while we were at the lake. 


Both of us tried to rationalize and make excuses, but we both knew something was deeply wrong. 


It was getting late by then, and none of us had cellphones to try and call out. Even if we did, I doubt there would have been reception out where we were. So reluctantly, we made the choice to spend the night in the car and try to hike out in the morning. 


They all thought Dave was a psycho who was messing with us now, I still couldn’t shake that thing from my mind. Neither could Harry, who admitted to similar feelings when I questioned him. Though his suspicions still lay with whoever or whatever Dave was. I couldn’t blame him; from what he said, I gathered he hadn’t gotten as clear a view of that thing as I had. 


The sun set, and the night came in like a blanket, almost calm until around 10 o’clock, an ear-splitting scream broke the stillness of the night. It was a man’s voice, clearly in extreme pain, yelling and crying wordlessly, it seemed to go on for an hour, though it was only about 5 minutes, and then silence returned to smother us. 


“What the hell was that?” Tom hissed, looking around at us, just a pair of wide eyes in the dark. 


Nobody answered for a long moment until Dick exhaled a long breath and whispered “we’ve got to find them, they’re hurt” 


“Yeah, we can’t leave someone out there injured with that psycho.” Harry’s voice was shaky with nerves, he was clearly fighting to suppress. 


“Bad idea,” my voice was definite, and Tom agreed with me, but I could already tell they weren’t going to be dissuaded. So I did the good thing as a friend, and I ran after them. A choice I would regret for the rest of my life. 



We slowly made our way through the trees, our flashlights playing around the woods looking for anything out of the ordinary. When we found it, or more specifically, him. Dave was lying in a clearing about ten feet from the edge of the woods, his face twisted in a mask of pain. His stomach was split in a ragged line from chest to crotch with blood pooling around the corpse. 



“It opened him up…” Harry said in a hollow voice


But among this scene of terror, one thing hit me with a sense of pure revulsion stronger than I have ever felt. Leading away from him in the blood were dozens of small twisted human tracks, from what looked like very young children crawling on all fours. 


“Let’s get out of here,” I mumbled, stepping back from the clearing. As I stepped back, I raised my light a few inches and caught something across the clearing like a baby with a broken back standing on its hands and feet splayed out, insect-like beside it. Its hands and feet turned the wrong way, then as I watched, it raised its little head, mouth dripping with gore, and began to cry. 



Next thing I remember I was running, Dick’s heavy feet pounding the ground right on my heels as I sprinted headlong through the woods. Bursting into the clearing, my foot caught on a branch, and I fell hard, feeling something in my wrist break. I forced myself to my feet and kept running for the car Dick reached it and flung open the door leaping in, and I reached it moments after. Holding my arm as pain lanced through me, I turned to look behind me for Harry, but he was nowhere to be seen.



“Get in!” Dick hissed, his tone bordering on hysterical. I wasn’t listening, I couldn’t abandon Harry, I wouldn’t!



“Harry!” I yelled, looking around desperately for any sign of him, but nothing. Not even the sound of nighttime animals, and finally defeated, I climbed back into the car.


Dick was sobbing, and my breath was coming in sharp pained breaths 



“What happened?” Tom almost screamed turning to look from me to Dick and back again. He got no answer instead Dick swore slamming his fist into the back of the seat gripped by some type of panicked fit, and I was pretty sure I was about to throw up.  



“What happened?” He was fully screaming now: a mix of fear and anger etched on his face as he looked from me to Dick. 



“Something, got Harry.” I managed to hiss out between clenched teeth. 



“You left him?!” Tom  spluttered, clearly not getting how bad the situation was



“Opened. Him. Up.” We all went silent like a switch had been thrown, at the faint sound of Harry’s voice, but it wasn’t right, it was oddly blank and toneless, and the delivery was stilted and awkward. Turning, I could see him at the edge of the clearing holding his stomach as if he were about to be sick, then he seemed to shake himself and stand up straight, walking closer, I could faintly hear him mumble, “Opened. Up” 



Wordlessly and almost without thought, I found myself leaning forward and fumbling for the door lock in the front seat. 



“What are you doing?” Tom hissed, sounding scandalized at my actions 



“Open. Up,” He said, walking up to the car window and leaning down to look in like a cop writing us a ticket, only he was wearing a dirty shirt and smiling like something was physically pulling back his cheeks. “Open up,” He spoke again, almost naturally


Tom reached across for the lock, but found himself pinned by Dick who held his arm to the dash, crouched forward and shaking. He had a wild, half-crazed look in his eyes, and his voice was faint and breathless as he whispered, “That’s not him, man.” 


“Commmme onnn guyys,” Harry slurred these words from outside the window, then seemed to shift as he finished “open up.” His tone now totally natural, then he repeated, “Come on, guys, open up.” Almost perfectly natural, calm, and cheerful as he stared unblinkingly into the window. 


A long few minutes passed as we sat frozen, the thing that used to be our friend calmly looking in, as we waited. His speech grew more natural, and he started to talk coherently. 


“Real funny joke guys, but come on now. Just let me in.” 


“Let me in” He began to chant, growing more frantic with every repetition, that death mask grin never slipping an inch as he started to shout. 


“Let me in” 


“Let me in.”


“Let me in!” 


“LET ME IN!” On the final sound, he made a noise between a laugh and a scream and began to beat his head against the door until red blood ran down the glass. Then for an instant he looked confused, the smile finally falling from his face as he mouthed one word clearly through the glass, an instant later the smile was back and wider than before, muscles on his neck stood out and began to twitch under the strain as he fell back and began to writhe on the ground as if having a seizure. The word that he mouthed to us in that moment of clarity was “Run.” 


We all listened to our friend for the last time and scrambled out the doors on the far side of the car. Bolting for the direction of the access road that led out of the park. Or at least I thought we all did, but as I reached the last turn before the car would be out of sight and glanced back, I saw Tom on the ground, and something white, naked, and fleshy forcing itself into his mouth while Harry held him down. 



My feet pounded into the gravel road, and my chest burned with overexertion. The pure fire of adrenaline sang in my veins, pushing me beyond what I could do and into an area where I risked hurting myself if I continued, but I didn’t care. Dick was a few feet ahead of me head down and sprinting for his life as we passed the dark silhouette of the bathhouse and rushed towards the entrance of the campsite. 


We stumbled to a stop realizing we were not alone, a figure was crouched in the middle of the entrance, its head cocked like a curious animal as it watched us. The shadows of the trees played a camouflage pattern of dark and light across its pale, sagging skin, and a long pink tongue lolled from its grinning mouth and over one of its eyes, Its head was twisted so that they looked out from beneath the mouth, and a mane of dark wild hair fell from that to the ground. It didn’t move, just sat watching us. 

Dick didn’t say anything, just sank to his feet and began to quietly sob. I looked around for an escape and saw Tom and Harry standing behind us, slowly walking forward. Harry with a natural gait, while Tom limped and spasmed unnaturally, though even as I watched seemed to grow more coordinated. 



“Come on we’ve gotta go” I hissed trying to pull dick to his feet, but he had always been larger than me, and limp as he was it was like lifting a sack of wet dirt. 



“Wake me up,” He muttered incoherently as I tried to pull him to his feet, but all I managed to do was overbalance both of us, and we fell to the roadbed. The pain of landing again on my broken arm caused a galaxy of stars to explode inside my head. White hot lines of anger lancing up my arm and into my chest, but I didn’t have time to pass out. So I forced myself to my feet, swaying drunkenly as I tried to catch my breath. Tom and Harry were closer now, though the beast still watched silently, its crooked head giving off an almost bored energy. 



“Dick we have to go!” I shouted in his ear, but he didn’t react or seem to hear me. There was one last thing I could think to do, so I pulled back my leg and kicked him hard in the mouth. There was a crunch, and blood poured from broken teeth, but through the pain and confusion in his eyes, I could see his mind return. “Come on!” I shouted, grabbing for his arm with my good hand. Slowly, he pulled himself to his feet, almost bringing me down again, but we stood, and after a moment of unsteadiness began to move towards the edge of the woods. At first limping and then stumbling and finally running, we crashed through the underbrush, my mind using the pain of twigs slashing at my face to refocus itself. 



Eventually, exhaustion, aided by the realization that we were hopelessly lost, forced us to stop and take stock of where we were. We were alone in a tree-shaded hollow formed by two moss-covered boulders leaning against each other. Shaking from exertion, I leaned against one and slid to the ground, letting its cool surface ground me in reality. 



“Where are we?” Dick asked after a long time of tense silence. 


“I, don’t know.” I wheezed, my chest still burning and my heart racing like I was about to die from the wild run in the dark, far more exercise than I was used to. Hysterically, a useless part of my mind promised to buy a treadmill if I ever lived the rest of my mind condemning it for wasting time, which was equally useless in our situation.



“We’re miles from t’road.” His voice was sluggish and whistled oddly through the broken teeth as he talked. It was clear that even the few words he had said were torture for him, and I felt a stab of guilt go through me.  



“Sorry,” I started, but he cut me off with a shake of his head 



“Not impor-tant.” his slurred voice turning the syllables into separate words. Then he glanced around at the thick trees, instantly my body tensed, ready to resume our run, but walking over to a large pine, whose lower few feet were scarred by the horns of deer. 



“Look for road,” He mumbled, pointing up at the tree, and testing a deep gouge for footing as he spoke. 

“No,” I hissed, “It’s not safe.” He responded with a painful sound that I think was supposed to be a laugh. Slowly, he pulled himself up until he could reach a branch. Unsteadily, he yanked himself onto it before pausing a moment to catch his breath, then repeated the process, moving higher. I should be the one to climb; I was smaller and lighter, but with my broken wrist, I could never make it off the ground. Slowly, I watched as he faded into the shadow of the upper branches. The occasional grunt of effort and the swaying of the pine, the only indications that he was still on this planet. 



“What are. You doing?” Came a toneless choppy voice from behind me, and spinning on my feet, I saw him. 



Tom was standing a few feet away, smiling like the Cheshire Cat, his unblinking eyes slowly moving from me to the tree and back. 



My back was to the boulder, and the thing that used to be my friend was in front of me. I had nowhere to go, and the fear and exhaustion seemed to fade as a sudden calm flowed from somewhere within me. The realization that I was about to die was freeing, in an unpleasant way. 



“What are you going to do?” Tom asked his voice somewhere between a robot and a mocking tone. It enraged me to hear this thing, this monster pretend to be my friend. So as it lunged, I shifted to the side and pushed off with my feet. My broken wrist was crushed against the rock, and for maybe half a second, my world went dark. 



As my eyes focused, I watched the twisted-Tom-thing’s head smash into the rock, its neck turning at an angle with a sickening crack like firewood. It seemed to shake spasmodically as it collapsed into a limp heap at the base of the rock, and to my shock, I saw tears in his dying eyes. 



Then he screamed.



“John, run!” Dick was a few branches us now, and he screamed for me to run. But it made no sense. Why should I run? The feeling in my arm had gone beyond pain into some new, indescribable sensation, and the cool ground felt good against my face. Running would require an effort I simply did not possess. Almost lazily, my eyes drifted to Tom, and I tried to focus on him. Something was happening; his crumpled form seemed to twist from within, as blood began to stain his shirt. 



Dick leapt from the bottom branch to the ground throwing up a cloud of leaves, I heard a sound of pain, limping over he grabbed me, and as I had done to him before, he screamed for me to run. I couldn’t, my eyes refused to leave Tom. A burst of blood and some other fluid gushed from the wound to mingle on the ground as a dozen little things spilled out from under his shirt. They were twisted, half-formed abortions that screamed with a wailing cry as they flopped on the ground. Even so, this close, I could tell that they were baby versions of the twisted man-thing that I had seen the previous night, and had again blocked our way to the road.  



I remember that I screamed, but nothing after that for a span of minutes at least. Next thing I know for sure, that isn’t an image or sound disjointed from context in my mind, is that I was running through the dark woods, or quickly limping at least. I had an arm around Dick’s shoulder, and somehow I knew he had hurt his ankle jumping from the tree, though I couldn’t remember how. There was a knife-sharp line between seeing the dying baby things and now, where I knew I had lost time in between. It didn’t matter. Tom was dead, really dead, and as I stumbled through the trees, I had to fight to not let the grief overwhelm me. He had been my friend, but like Harry, he was gone…



Dick had seen the road close to where we were when he reached the top of the tree, and we were limping now towards it. Some distance behind us, I heard the sound of a… thing running full sprint through the woods. It was getting closer, but we couldn’t move any faster. Dick’s feet slipped, and his weight caught me and soon we were both falling, we hit the ground and rolled into something cool and wet. 


A creekbed, some small voice in my mind observed. I couldn’t even feel pain at that point, it was as if my nerves had burned away, just a distant sensation of wrongness told me how bad my arm was. Shifting from where I lay, I stared up. There was something warm in my eyes, and they were having trouble focusing. Still atop the bank, I could see the form of Harry smiling down at us. His shirt hung open, revealing the swollen flesh below, pregnant with more of the nascent things that grew in blood and pus. 



“Tom opened up too soon,” He said matter-of-factly, but nothing was making sense anymore. I felt stunned, I felt disconnected, I felt high… I felt like my mind had broken under the weight of all I had seen, and I was analytically watching myself go insane from behind my own eyes. I didn’t care.



Dick screamed, a feral inhuman sound and flung a rock at the Harry-thing’s head, it impacted with a thud and left a visible dent, but it didn’t flinch as the rock bounced away. Still Dick roared, until the rough sound of it made me sure he was damaging his throat, hurling anything he could reach in a frantic attempt to die fighting. I only shuddered quietly as I willed myself to my feet. Harry’s movements grew unsteady as Dick’s projectiles did damage to his dying… his dead body. 


I knew it was too late, I half walked, half fell up the other bank of the creek, my feet on autopilot as my eyes tried to focus on a gap in the brush where I could see a red, reflective stop sign. Two screams followed each other in quick succession behind me, one I knew to be Harry finally hatching, I could only hope that Dick had killed him, and caused the things to spew out prematurely like with Tom for a moment, because the hoarse sound of Dick’s final wail dispelled any hope. I could hear them gurgling behind me, like the random sounds of an infant and the chittering of an insect as I stumbled towards the stop sign, towards salvation. 



Beyond them, I heard another sound, a deep guttural growl that I could only assume was coming from some older, darker thing. I didn’t care, if I could reach the red sign, I would be fine. It glowed like a beacon even as the roar got louder. Then there was a squeal, high-pitched and unmistakably manmade, before everything went dark. 


The driver’s panicked voice as she fussed over me blurs into the sound of the paramedic shouting numbers as I was wheeled under some artificial light. A confusing slide show of disjointed images and words is all I have for what feels like a long time after that.



“Blood loss.” A dark figure looks down at me, momentarily blocking the light



“Severe concussion.” A stabbing pain, then a feeling of cool numbness flowing from it



“Have to-” Sweet, narcotic darkness…



I woke days later, in the county hospital, confused and in pain. They had taken my arm, they had taken my friends. I was alone. 



The police came later, time still wasn’t making sense, and asked more questions than I could keep track of. It took a while before I understood that they suspected I had killed my friends. I guess technically, I had killed Tom at least. Or had I? 

No!  That thing with the twisted head, the mother of all those foul infants, it was the killer, the monster, the demon. 


Eventually, they went away, and I learned later that the investigation had been dropped after the coroner examined the bodies. He killed himself, I think. Nothing much made sense for a long time, everything was still a blur of doctors and nurses and cops and people I don’t remember flitting in and out of my memory like ghosts. Ghosts, I am haunted by ghosts, my oldest and best friends taken from me by whatever that was. 


Eventually, my mind almost began to work again, and the doctors sounded less worried when they spoke about me. A few weeks more and they released me to go home. I called a cab. 



It drove me from the hospital up my driveway and stopped in front of my house, then it left and took me to the ferry terminal, where with just the clothes on my back, I purchased a ticket and left the island I had lived on all my life… Hanging over my garage from rusty tacks I used to hold up Christmas lights were three little metal figures, twisting in the wind…

1m0i204,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m0i204/what_is_a_semiautomatic_espresso_machine/,What is a semi-automatic espresso machine?,"As a coffee lover, I've always been fascinated by the world of espresso. Recently, I've been diving deep into the different types of espresso machines, and I want to share what I've learned about semi-automatic espresso machines.

A semi-automatic espresso machine is a popular choice for home baristas and coffee enthusiasts. It offers a balance between control and convenience, allowing you to have a hands-on experience while still benefiting from some automated features.

The main components of a semi-automatic espresso machine include a boiler, a pump, a portafilter, and a group head. The boiler heats the water to the right temperature, while the pump pressurizes the water. The portafilter holds the ground coffee, and the group head is where the hot water meets the coffee grounds to extract the espresso.

What sets a semi-automatic machine apart is that you control the brewing process. You'll need to grind the coffee, tamp it into the portafilter, and start and stop the extraction yourself. This gives you the freedom to adjust variables like grind size, tamping pressure, and extraction time to perfect your shot.

The ""semi-automatic"" part comes from the machine's ability to maintain consistent water temperature and pressure. Unlike manual machines, where you have to control these factors yourself, a semi-automatic takes care of them for you.

One of the biggest advantages of a semi-automatic espresso machine is the learning experience it provides. You'll gain a deeper understanding of how different factors affect your espresso's taste. It's a great way to develop your skills as a home barista.

If you're considering getting a semi-automatic espresso machine, I've found some great options at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They have a wide range of machines suitable for beginners and experienced users alike.

Semi-automatic machines are also versatile. Most come with a steam wand, allowing you to froth milk for lattes and cappuccinos. Some even have built-in grinders, making them all-in-one solutions for your espresso needs.

Maintenance is another factor to consider. Semi-automatic machines generally require regular cleaning and descaling to keep them in top shape. But don't let this scare you off – it's not as daunting as it might sound, and proper care will ensure your machine lasts for years.

Price-wise, semi-automatic machines can vary greatly. You can find entry-level models for a few hundred dollars, while high-end machines can cost over a thousand. It's worth investing in a quality machine if you're serious about your coffee, as it will produce better results and likely last longer.

If you're ready to explore the world of semi-automatic espresso machines, check out the selection at https://athometouch.com/Espresso-Machines. They offer machines for every budget and skill level, and you might find the perfect one for your kitchen.

In conclusion, a semi-automatic espresso machine is a great choice for anyone who wants to have control over their espresso-making process while still enjoying some automated features. It's a fantastic way to learn about espresso extraction and can help you make cafe-quality drinks at home. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coffee lover, a semi-automatic machine could be the perfect addition to your coffee setup.",1,1752586797.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

I’m researching a concept for a pooled buying group for independent coffee shops in the UK — starting with things like coffee beans, alternative milks, takeaway cups, and other repeat-use supplies.

The idea is simple:  
Instead of ordering alone (and paying £17–£22/kg for beans), 10–15 shops in the same area would order together — and unlock better supplier pricing (think £13–£15/kg), kind of like a mini buying syndicate.

We’d handle the coordination, supplier negotiation, payments, and deliveries — so it’s still simple for you.

Right now I’m just collecting feedback — and trying to understand:

* Is this a real pain point for you?
* Would you be open to something like this if it was easy to use?
* What would make or break it for you?

This is not about reducing quality and impacting how you service your valued customers.

Its about delivering technology to the high street independent stores, to compete with the chains on pricing from suppliers.

any feedback would be very welcome

I’m still pretty new to all this, so getting to taste something this fancy felt like a big deal.

Name: Glenmorangie Signet

ABV: 46%

Distillery: Glenmorangie

Region: Highlands, Scotland

Maturation: Includes roasted ""chocolate malt"" and a mix of ex-bourbon & sherry casks

Nose: The first thing I picked up was this rich chocolatey sweetness. There was something a little bitter and herbal underneath, maybe like coffee or Angostura bitters. I also got warm pastry notes.

Palate: Really smooth and syrupy on the tongue. Sweet cinnamon, orange zest, dried fruits. Then it shifts: espresso, roasted nuts, maybe dates or lychee in the background? There’s a toasty, nutty depth that really stuck with me. It was sweet but not over the top—rich in a layered way.

Finish: Drying, warm, and kind of earthy. I got leather, dark chocolate, even a weird (but nice) little funky note like truffle oil or damp oak. 

Final thoughts:This was the standout of the tasting for me. I wasn’t even sure I’d like it when they described it—“chocolate malt” sounded a bit gimmicky—but wow, it’s on another level. 

I got this bottle in a new app that a friend recommended that is call [Spiritory.com](http://Spiritory.com), really nice I can recommend it, I also started my digital collection there :)",4,1752586642.0,Scotch,0,0.83,False

1m0hy89,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1m0hy89/my_energy_fluctuates_every_few_days_and_i_have_no/,My energy fluctuates every few days... and I have no idea how to approach it.,"Short preface: I'm a student. Throughout the past couple of years, I've been studying regularly — or trying my best to, at least. I started a study journal as well as a normal journal detailing life problems and events sometime in late 2023, and a few days ago, equipped with free time and frustration, I read them all.

I've come to a conclusion about myself that seems... a bit ridiculous and unusual. I haven't found any case like this on the internet so far.

So, I've noticed that there are days when I'm highly productive, motivated, energized, happy, and my mind generally inclines toward positive thinking. I get about 5-9 things done from my to-do list. I manage to get a good hour of exercise done without many breaks. Life feels good.

Then comes the dreaded storm cloud. The dark days, if I'm permitted to be dramatic. Getting out of bed is exhausting, leaving the phone (be it tv shows, books, songs or yt shorts, which are my main go-tos for entertainment) — despite my brain ACTIVELY insisting I do so — is impossible. The screentime reaches so high that it's not entertainment anymore, it's torture.

Then I'm just, so exhausted. Even if I haven't spent my time on the phone, just starting a task is so difficult. Everything takes twice the effort and time. Simultaneously, a voice in my head goes, ""Are you doing this right? You barely got one thing done, you're a failure"" and while I logically try my best to ignore that voice, it sort of feels hopeless for a few days. Low energy days can last from 3 days to a week. I try to get at least 3 things done from my to do list, but honestly, even exercising and showering (not part of my to do list) take so much energy to do.

So I figured this out about myself a month ago. I've tried eating good food, snacking every two hours on healthy stuff with the occasional chocolate bar. It works for a very short while, if at all. Like, maybe half an hour of energy. Hydration; I'm chugging 2.5 liters every day. Coffee too, but it doesn't work for me. I've tried talking to my parents (I live with them) about it, and they think that forcing through the mental fog should work. However, forcing does NOT work, if anything, I feel worse and worse by the end when I don't get more and more things completed.

Taking a break seems counterproductive and unrealistic; I cannot take breaks for the entire week. However, I barely manage to get anything done on those days. If you were to see my study journal, you'd be surprised by the amount of things I got done in one week, and then the next week is just... *blank*. Literally.

I'm sick of going through the same cycle again and again. I've tried habit stacking, but when the low energy days hit, the tower crumbles down into dust. Pomodoro only works once I set the timer, and I can't even get myself to switch on the timer app. Routines don't exactly work for me, but I do at least eat and exercise at the same time every day. I've done a couple more of the other common tricks too...

I don't think the low energy days happen randomly, but I don't know the actual cause for it. Sometimes, there are triggers, like feeling sick, or financial problems that prompt me to spiral, or sometimes the thought that my efforts are going to waste. Sometimes it's other real life problems. And periods too, like I *cannot* function during my period. But they don't occur all the time, which is what has me confused. Why is this pattern so regular?

Has anyone here ever felt this? What are your thoughts on this? Is there a way to make all the days regular functioning days? And what should I do to get through the low days? Or am I alone in feeling this?

**TLDR:** I have days where I can get a LOT of things done, and then days where I am so tired and burnt out that I can barely shower and exercise. And eat. Sometimes. They come without warning. Sometimes the days where i get NONE done are at a greater frequency than the days where I do get things done.

**Edited to add:** On the low energy days, even the hobbies I usually like don't feel exciting to do.",1,1752586532.0,productivity,4,1.0,False

All of our 5-inch inseam bathing suits are now restocked! Be sure to size up one for the perfect fit, trust me on this, you’ll thank yourself later.

We’ve also restocked the silk-cotton short sleeve tees, ideal as we head into the transition season. Stay ahead of the game.

In addition, both the lightweight and heavyweight Bamboo Sorona piece-dyed tees are back, along with a limited number of our linen beach towels. These towels are hand-sewn with the WvG monogram and woven in Italy on traditional shuttle looms by Fernando and his son Vittorio.

I’m hoping to drop another batch before I leave Italy. A lot of items are finished and ready to go, the delay is due to customs and the process of syncing everything with our 3PL.

On a side note, I’ve just received all the samples from Japan. I’m planning to film a video later this week or next to discuss them. It’s time for a serious conversation about the East vs. West project, and I can’t wait to hear your thoughts.",6,1752586349.0,wolfvsgoat,1,1.0,False
1m0hvmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m0hvmn/could_the_toddy_cold_brew_system_redefine_your/,Could the Toddy Cold Brew System redefine your coffee experience? A detailed review awaits!,"Testing the **Toddy THM Cold Brew System** has been an enjoyable journey into the world of cold-brewed coffee. As someone who brews coffee daily, the product brings both satisfaction and some surprising insights. This manual coffee infuser, designed for cold brew enthusiasts, promises a smooth and flavorful brewing experience, and it does deliver in many ways.

**Simplicity of Design**  
The straightforward design of this cold brew system is one of its appealing qualities. The set includes a brewing container with a handle, glass decanter with a lid, two reusable filters, a rubber stopper, as well as a recipe guide and instructions. It’s built with a white finish, giving it a clean, minimalist look that doesn’t clash with other kitchen appliances. At first glance, it might seem like just a simple contraption, but after setting it up for the first brew, I realized how thoughtful the layout is. The components all fit together with precision, and the generous size of the container allows for making a decent quantity of cold brew.  

**Ease of Use**  
Anyone can operate this system without confusion. Since it's entirely manual, there are no confusing buttons or electronics. You assemble the parts, add coffee grounds and water, wait for the steeping process, and then release the stopper to let the brewed coffee drip into the decanter. It’s as straightforward as it gets. I love the fact that you can walk away without worrying about electronics or timers failing halfway. However, I found that steeping cold brew for an optimal 12 hours can sometimes feel like a patience game, especially when you want your coffee right away.  

**[Check Toddy THM Cold Brew System price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0006h0jvw/)**  

**Perks of the Cold Brewed Flavor**  
What captured me most is the end result—smooth, rich coffee that lacks the acidity or bitterness often found in typical hot-brewed coffee. Using the recommended grind size (medium-coarse) significantly enhances the extraction process, delivering consistent results every time. Switching up the coffee beans would yield wildly different flavors, and this thing even works like a charm with loose leaf tea brews. The reusable filters are effective at keeping the grounds out, which spares you those unpleasant gritty textures.  

**Storage and Durability**  
This system is incredibly lightweight at just 1.48 pounds, and its compact dimensions (7.25"" x 7.25"" x 12.5"") make it a breeze to store. I'm always short of countertop space, and being able to tuck this away neatly when not in use is a relief. The glass decanter feels sturdy despite being lightweight, though I do take care to place it on a protective surface to avoid accidental chips or cracks. However, if you’re clumsy like me, you might consider investing in a backup decanter just in case.  

**Winning Points**  
Here are some of the noticeable positives:  
- Produces rich, flavorful cold brew with minimal effort.  
- Includes reusable filters, cutting down on waste.  
- The recipe guide is great for beginners.  
- Compact design that’s easy to store.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
No product is perfect, and a few things could be improved:  
- The brewing process takes time—up to 12 hours.  
- Manual operation might not appeal to those accustomed to automatic machines.  
- Cleaning the reusable filters is a bit tedious sometimes.  

**Competing Products**  
Other popular alternatives include the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker and Hario Cold Brew Bottles. Compared to the Toddy system, the OXO features a rainmaker lid to ensure even water distribution and a stainless-steel mesh filter that cuts out the need for replacements. Hario offers a sleek design, but it caters to smaller batch brewing, which might not work for everyone. The Toddy system holds its ground with capacity and simplicity, but some might consider OXO’s additional features worth the higher price.  

**Value for Money**  
If brewing flavorful coffee with ease is your goal, this product lives up to expectations. While it doesn’t have bells and whistles like automatic timers or alarms, its manual operation keeps it simple, reliable, and accessible. With reusable filters and the ability to make both coffee and tea, the system proves its versatility. It’s definitely a smart buy for cold brew lovers who appreciate an unfussy brewing experience.

1m0hvjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1m0hvjw/reviews_of_every_sorce_perfume_ive_tried_spoiler/,Reviews of Every Sorce Perfume I’ve Tried (Spoiler: It’s A Lot),"In the past several months, I’ve become kind of obsessed with Sorce, and have gotten my hands on quite a few scents from them to pretty great results. 

Some background: I’ve been into indie fragrance for over a decade now. My favorite notes are vanilla, peach, sandalwood, lavender, cardamom, woodsmoke, and basil. Death notes include cherry, headshop incense, bubblegum, and most white florals.

* **2am in Lafayette** *(Vanilla co2, oakmoss, cafe au lait, ribbons of caramel, beignets dusted with powdered sugar; EDP format)*

Definitely coffee! It’s not as photorealistic of a coffee note as Bath Sabbath Cupajoe, but it's still very distinctly coffee. This is not a black coffee, but rather a nicely sweet cup of coffee with milk and sugar. What I love about this is the addition of the oakmoss; it really tempers the sugary notes in this and adds this wonderful earthiness that pairs perfectly with the gooey caramel. It’s gourmand, but not foodie. I’m getting a hint of pastry in the back, but it's not super prominent. There’s something very addictive about this perfume, and I’m a big fan. Excellent longevity and decent throw.

Matching Song: “Moon Over Bourbon Street” by Sting

*TL;DR: Sweet coffee tempered with earthy oakmoss. Smells addictive in a good way. 5/5*

* **A Sign Painted Peaches** *(Peach nectar, sun-warmed peach skin, saffron, gardenia, ambergris, vanilla absolute, vetiver; oil format)*

I’m honestly surprised by how much I like this! I’m a known white floral hater, so I figured the gardenia would make this a no-go, but it pairs perfectly with the juiciness of the peach. This is very much a blended scent where individual notes are harder to pick out, but I’m mainly getting that stunning peach + gardenia combo with a little saltiness from the ambergris. This is sunshine in a bottle, heady but somehow light, sexy in an understated, coy way, and perfect for spring and summer. Decent longevity and throw.

Matching Song: “Sunlight” by Hozier

*TL;DR: Juicy peach and heady gardenia with a hint of salt. So sunny and bright. 4/5*

* **Cabanilla** *(Salted vanilla, sand, palm fronds, driftwood, a cracked coconut, brown sugar, balsam of Peru, and a distant beach bonfire; EDP format)*

I was hoping that this was going to be the perfect beach-y summer scent, but alas, it was not meant to be. Unfortunately, the coconut goes straight sunscreen on me and just dominates the rest of the notes. I’m getting a hint of the smoke, but its not enough to stop the Coppertone onslaught. Good throw and decent longevity. 

Matching Song: “God Only Knows” by The Beach Boys

*TL;DR: Coconut sunscreen. 1.5/5*

* **Don’t Whistle in the Woods** *(Cedar, sandalwood, cypriol, fir balsam, black vanilla, sugar, ambrette, and a hint of fur; oil format)*

Now this is a perfume that just screams “autumn.” It’s sweeter than I expected, almost maple syrup-y, but the variety of wood notes keep it from getting way too sweet or foodie. There’s a fuzziness to it as well, maybe from the fur note? This smells like a friendly werewolf, or the cousin of the Big Bad Wolf who helps your grandma cross the street instead of eating her and stealing her identity. Good longevity, low throw.

Matching Song: “The Wolf” by PHILDEL

*TL;DR: Sugared dark woods. Perfect for fall. 4/5*

* **English Major** *(Library books, orris absolute, marshmallow, decalepis absolute (sustainably harvested), carrot seed, sandalwood, fallen leaves; EDP format)*

This one is really evocative. The carrot is quite prominent and there’s something kind of spicy about it too. I’m also getting this interesting mix of the marshmallow and the fallen leaves, which is both crisp and cozy. The library books (specifically that almost vanilla parchment smell) rounds out the base. It’s earthy, warm, and studious, but with a hint of sweetness, and falls somewhere between an atmospheric and a gourmand. It reminds me of my college years in the Northeast, studying in the old library building as the leaves fall outside. It also feels like a mix of two Maison Margiela Replica scents: By the Fireplace and Whispers in the Library. Good longevity, average throw. 

Matching Song: “The Curse” by Agnes Obel

*TL;DR: Evocative, earthy, warm, and just a little sweet. Very autumnal. 4/5*

* **Follow Me Into the Deep** *(Vanilla orchid, sweetened coconut milk, tonka, nutmeg; oil format)*

Well, the coconut doesn’t go sunscreen which is great! That said, the rest of the scent is just kind of underwhelming for me. Don’t get me wrong, it’s pretty! It’s simple and linear, which isn’t necessarily a problem, but this is the Sorce scent that smells the most generic to me. It’s thoroughly fine and that’s it. My skin also eats it, resulting in basically no throw or longevity. 

Matching Song: “The Siren” by Nadiiife

*TL;DR: Vanilla and coconut. Simple and basic. Vanished on me. 2.5/5*

* **Fuckery** *(Luxardo cherry, caramelized sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood, tobacco absolute, smoke, night air, clean sheets,; oil format)*

Despite the rave reviews of this scent, I had a feeling that I was going to dislike it and I was right. I just can’t abide by anything cherry. It doesn’t matter the house, it all smells like cough syrup to me. I guess this one is sexy cough syrup, like a Bond girl with a cold. I could see this scent being a knockout for people who like cherry, but that is not me. Good throw and longevity, though.

Matching Song: “One Time” by Marian Hill

*TL;DR: Sexy cherry cough syrup. 0/5*

* **Match Made in Heaven** *(Matcha, vanilla soft serve, cherry blossom, almond, waffle cone, powdered sugar, creamy sandalwood; EDP format)*

The myth and the legend. This is super pretty, and I see why I was sold out for months last year. I mainly get powdery, semi-sweet matcha and almond, with a hint of cherry blossom. Very feminine and springy. That said, this is a case where this smells way better on other people than it does on me. One of my best friends has this and it’s *stunning* on her; it's sweeter and more balanced, whereas there’s a dustiness on me that I don’t like. I’d say this is a crowd pleaser fleurmand.  

Matching Song: “All This and Heaven Too” by Florence + The Machine

*TL;DR: Dusty matcha and almond on me,  pretty fleurmand on other people. Very YMMV. 3/5* 

* **Serpentine** *(Ripe figs, fig leaf, cardamom, caramelized honey, vanilla, Peru balsam, Cedar, Iso E Super; oil format)*

I’m kind of torn on this one. On one hand, this is a slinky, sexy green fig and honey scent that I can’t stop smelling. On the other hand, there’s something about this that smells a little overripe in a way that I’m not a fan of. I find that to be a problem with fig scents in general, though this is probably my favorite fig scent that I’ve tried. I think I’m going to hang on to my sample and see if age does anything. Good longevity, low throw. 

Matching Song: “the fruits” by Paris Paloma

*TL;DR: Slinky green fig and honey, almost overripe. 3.5/5*

* **Sit for a Spell** *(Salted cantaloupe, a light drizzle of wild rosemary honey, fresh spring air, ambrette seed, and winding honeysuckle vines; oil format)*

Oh, this is pretty. You’ve got this juicy, sweet and salty cantaloupe (an unusual note!), the heady honeyed scent of the honeysuckle, and the slight herbal bite from the rosemary. This has the same aromatic solar feel as A Sign Painted Peaches. It’s so refreshing! Perfect for warm weather. This is less a scent so much as a time, place, and experience. It’s the smell of sitting out on your porch in the South in the late afternoon, eating perfectly ripe cantaloupe and listening to the bugs chirp. I’d also like to give this perfume the distinction of being truly unique in my collection; nothing else smells even close to it. Decent throw and longevity. 

Matching Song: “Slow Burn” by Kacey Musgraves

*TL;DR: A summer afternoon in the South, distilled into a perfume. Refreshing and perfect for hot weather. 4.5/5*

* **Snow Moon Magic** *(Lavender sugar, vanilla steamed milk, chai spices, tonka bean, Cashmeran, Ambroxan, crystals charged by the moonlight (our crystal accord), marshmallow, cookie butter, and Tahitian vanilla; oil format)*

The cookie butter comes out strongly, and the lavender fades into the background. Its sweet and cozy, and reminds me of Poesie Comfort, which is one of my favorite scents. There’s a hint of the chai spices in there. I’d say that this is gourmand but not foodie; the lavender and ambroxan keep it from smelling too much like food. That said, I destashed it. Why? Because throw and longevity are extremely low. Within an hour, I can’t smell it even after sticking my nose in it, and I’m a perfume slatherer.

Matching Song: “Sweater Weather” by The Neighborhood 

*TL;DR: Cookie butter and chai, but doesn’t last at all. 2/5*

* **Strings of Light in the Forest** *(Vetiver, lavender, beeswax absolute, golden orbs of amber, vanilla milkshake, Ambroxan; EDP format)*

To put it simply: this scent is a masterpiece and one of my holy grails. The lavender is herbal and not sweet, like the lavender in Deconstructing Eden Them, and the combination with the creamy, milky vanilla is magnificent. Then you have the earthiness of the vetiver and a little warm, honey-ness from the beeswax. It’s cozy and beautiful. The name is perfect; it makes me picture the decorations for an intimate party at twilight with your friends in the fae folk. Excellent longevity and throw.  

Matching Song: “Evening” by The Moody Blues

*TL;DR: Herbal lavender + vanilla with earthiness and warmth. Cozy and beautiful. My favorite Sorce scent. 5/5*

* **The Cookie Party** *(Mouthwatering, buttery toffee, hot cocoa with floofy marshmallow, mounds of coconut, and pecan shortbread cookies; oil format)*

This is a really photorealistic bakery/dessert scent. It's super rich and buttery, but it's also way too sweet for me. This smells like getting beaten up by the entire line of Girl Scout Cookies at once. Strong throw and decent longevity. 

Matching Song: “Primadonna” by MARINA

*TL;DR: Ultra sweet realistic baked goods. 2/5*

* **The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake** *(Warm peach cake spiced with ginger, cinnamon, and cardamom; vanilla bean ice cream, Mysore sandalwood, Australian sandalwood; oil format)*

Now this is a heartbreaker. In the bottle, I smelled wonderfully spicy peach cake, but on my skin, it’s the LaCroix version of that. Yes, I smell peach and cake and spices, but they all feel very muted and subdued, like that cake was eaten hours ago and all that’s left is a faint smell of what was once there. It’s a real shame, but my skin chemistry just doesn’t like this scent. Low longevity and throw.

Matching Song: “Radio” by Lana del Rey

*TL;DR: Spiced peach cake with a low battery. Weirdly faint and subdued. 2/5*

* **What Big Eyes You Have** *(Immortelle absolute, lemon meringue pie, pearlescent vanilla musk; oil format)*

Now this is the kind of foodie scent that I like, since it isn’t tooth-rottingly sweet to me. It’s fairly straightforward, and smells exactly like one of those lemon bar pastries, but with the tiniest hint of something darker and smokier. However, both the throw and longevity are low. 

Matching Song: “Hello, Goodbye” by The Beatles

*TL;DR: Lemon bar pastry, but it disappears fast. 3/5* 

* **Where the Wild Things Grow I** *(Late spring strawberries still on the vine, vanilla cream soda, fresh green grass with morning dew, and ambrette seed; oil format)*

This one was recommended as a photorealistic strawberry scent, and I have to admit, I’m confused by that. To me, this smells like a fizzy strawberry candy; think something like Pop Rocks. It’s fun and youthful and great for spring and summer, but it’s not close to what I was wanting. I don’t get any green notes at all. Maybe the other version of this scent is worth trying? Low throw, decent longevity. 

Matching Song: “Strawberry Swing” by Coldplay

*TL;DR: Fizzy strawberry candy. 2/5*

1m0htdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m0htdl/could_the_keurig_kslim_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Could the Keurig K-Slim Single Serve Coffee Maker Redefine Small-Space Brewing? Review Here!,"The Keurig K900 K-Slim Single Serve Brewer is a sleek addition to my kitchen arsenal. As someone who values both functionality and compact designs, I was immediately intrigued by its promise of efficiency packed in a frame that’s less than 5 inches wide. After using it daily for a few weeks, I can confidently share my experience with this shiny little coffee wizard.

**DESIGN & SPACE-SAVING PERKS**  
Its slim profile makes it a lifesaver for limited countertop space. I'd been struggling to fit a coffee maker amidst my toaster, cutting board, and inevitable clutter, but this one slipped in seamlessly. The white finish adds a clean aesthetic, blending into my kitchen rather than standing out like a hulking appliance. Additionally, the removable drip tray makes it suitable for taller mugs, so my favorite 7-inch travel thermos can now join the coffee party without issue.

**MULTISTREAM TECHNOLOGY IN ACTION**  
I was skeptical about Keurig's Multistream Technology claim until my first brew. Somehow, multiple streams of water pierced through the K-Cup and managed to extract deeper flavors than my older machine ever did. Whether it's a bold roast in the morning or a mellow afternoon decaf, the taste just hits differently. Each sip feels fuller-bodied, and the aroma—it’s as if my kitchen transforms into a cozy little coffee shop.  

[Check Keurig K900 K-Slim price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08v8c8n42/)  

**BREW OPTIONS & EFFICIENCY**  
Customization is one of my favorite aspects of this brewer. With the ability to select between 8 oz., 10 oz., or 12 oz. cup sizes at the push of a button, no more mornings wondering if I brewed enough! The multiple-cup water reservoir holds up to 46 oz., meaning I can brew around four standard cups before needing to refill. The fast-brewing feature is also a win—coffee in under two minutes saves me during my chaotic weekday mornings.

**ENERGY-SAVING FEATURES**  
For anyone counting pennies on their electricity bill, this coffee maker is a silent hero. It shuts off automatically after five minutes of inactivity, which is kind on both your wallet and the environment. I accidentally left the machine idle for hours once, only to return and realize it had powered down itself. No burnt-out coffee maker smell in sight.

**QUALITIES THAT IMPRESS**  
- Multistream Technology delivers full flavor extraction.  
- Compact and space-efficient design perfect for smaller kitchens.  
- Fast brewing with three customizable cup sizes.  
- Travel mug-friendly and easy drip tray removal.  

**AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT**  
Naturally, nothing is perfect, and while this machine has won my heart, there are a couple of annoyances:  
- The water reservoir, though convenient, is slightly awkward to remove fully for refilling.  
- It's not the quietest brewer around; early risers might wake others in the house.  
- Compatibility with reusable filters is great, but finding them separately adds a small extra expense.

**MARKET RIVALS**  
I’ve previously tried the Nespresso Essenza Mini, which has its charm but focuses heavily on espresso-style drinks, missing the customizable cup sizes I love in the K-Slim. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, on the other hand, allows you to brew with fresh grounds or pods but is bulkier and less aesthetically appealing. What the Keurig K-Slim does best is balance features with compactness, making it an excellent choice for those short on space but unwilling to compromise on morning cup excellence.

**BUDGET-FRIENDLY CONSIDERATIONS**  
Balancing cost versus features, this single-serve brewer makes a strong case for itself. Comparable machines in the market often lack the Multistream Technology or compact design but sit at nearly the same price point. Is it worth the investment? If space and quality matter to you, I’d argue it definitely is. Plus, the energy-saving auto-off has already saved me from guilt (and higher bills) multiple times.

1m0hpgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m0hpgh/why_is_the_illy_y33_espresso_machine_perfect_for/,Why Is the Illy Y3.3 Espresso Machine Perfect for Coffee Lovers?,"Testing out the Illy 60472 espresso machine has been a daily ritual in my kitchen for weeks now. It’s a single-serve coffee maker designed for IperEspresso capsules, and I’ve got to admit, the design is sleek and modern enough to earn a permanent spot on my counter. At first glance, it’s compact with dimensions of just 11.73”D x 6.69”W x 14.96”H, so even my small apartment kitchen didn’t feel cramped with it. The promise of easy programmability and consistent brewing had my coffee-loving heart curious to see if it could live up to the hype.

**Ease of Use and Programmable Features**  
I’ve used quite a few espresso machines over the years, but this little gadget stands out in terms of simplicity. It comes with two programmable settings for making either espresso or drip coffee. Getting it set up and running felt almost foolproof—pop in a capsule, press a button, and voilà, delicious coffee ready in seconds. The buttons are incredibly intuitive, and as someone who’s not yet functional in the early hours without caffeine, simplicity is a lifesaver. Running through its programmable settings to tweak coffee strength was a breeze, and once I dialed in my preferences, it consistently delivered a cup tailored to my taste.

**[Ready to buy Illy 60472? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b08ppwfj12/)**

**Compact and Stylish Design**  
This espresso machine scores serious points in the aesthetics department. Its sleek black exterior feels modern while still blending into a variety of kitchen styles. The minimalistic design avoids clutter, which really appeals to me. Its compact footprint makes it ideal for apartments, office spaces, or anyone with limited counter space. I stashed it on a narrow shelf next to my microwave, and it barely took up any room. What surprised me, though, was how lightweight it is at just 7.58 pounds. Moving it around my tiny kitchen when I needed more space was hassle-free.  

**Performance and Brewing Speed**  
One standout feature is just how fast this machine heats up. I timed it during my morning coffee prep, and I had espresso brewed and ready to sip in under a minute. For anyone with a busy schedule or a tendency to snooze the alarm clock, the quick brewing time is practically a lifesaver. While the taste was consistently rich and aromatic, a lot of that quality has to do with the patented IperEspresso capsule system. It creates that creamy espresso crema you’d expect from a premium café. That said, the exclusivity of these capsules did make me wonder about long-term costs.

**Boons**  
- Effortless operation with intuitive buttons.  
- Compact and space-saving design, perfect for small spaces.  
- Heats up rapidly for minimal wait times.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Exclusivity to IperEspresso capsules limits flexibility.  
- Not ideal for those wanting larger cup sizes.  

**Compatibility with IperEspresso Capsules**  
One major draw of this espresso machine is its patented capsule system. IperEspresso capsules are designed specifically for this product, which delivers consistent results cup after cup. However, this exclusivity could be seen as a double-edged sword. While the coffee itself tastes undeniably fresh and high-quality, you’re tied to Illy’s capsules, which may not be the most budget-friendly option. I sometimes wished it had a reusable capsule option for experimenting with my own coffee grounds.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this espresso machine to its competitors was a fun little experiment. For instance, machines like the Nespresso Vertuo offer more versatility regarding capsule compatibility and coffee type. The Vertuo can handle a wider variety of brew sizes, but it struggles to match Illy’s machine in terms of compact design. Similarly, Keurig single-serve systems accommodate more affordable third-party pods and reusable filters, but they lack the standout espresso quality that the Illy machine delivers. If premium taste and compactness are your priorities, this machine has the edge. Those looking to save on capsule costs or wanting more flexibility might lean toward these alternatives.

**Value Proposition**  
This espresso maker isn’t exactly a budget buy, but it’s also not outrageously priced compared to other premium coffee machines. For its minimalist design, fast performance, and great-tasting espresso, it feels like a fair investment. You’re essentially paying for the convenience of a compact, foolproof machine paired with consistently excellent coffee. While you might spend a bit more on capsules, you’re also saving on your daily Starbucks run. Considering all the pros and cons, this espresso machine still feels like it’s worth a spot on your counter.

1m0hnpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1m0hnpm/is_there_a_way_to_turn_around_things_with_our/,"Is there a way to turn around things with our roommate, or are we doomed to live with jerk until one of us packs up and leaves the home.","Hello Internet I am Husband (M-32) and I live with my Wife (F-28) and my Best friend/Roommate (M-32). We have all lived together for about 3 years now and all went in on buying a home together. We had to have a lot of restrictions due to my RM’s Probation for a crime he committed early in his life.

Since being on probation RM has made sure to take care of everything and decided that he will do everything he can to redeem himself for his victims and for society. Even though what he did was awful knowing that he wanted to seek redemption made me proud and even though I am agnostic I truly believe that if someone truly atone’s for any “sins” they have committed then I believe they deserve that second chance. Because of this my wife who has been a victim of such a sin also gave him a chance once she knew about it. He has done well working with the law and trying to be accepted by society again and is working to obtain an order of nondisclosure and based on Data only 5% of felons have obtained this. I am proud of RM and have seen him suffer and work his ass off and he truly wishes to atone and somehow make it up to his victims as much as [possible.Now](http://possible.Now) for my wife she has been through alot! She is chronically sick and has a condition that only affects 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 people so not a lot of information and not a lot of ways to get help. Along with that we have been finding more and more health issues and even though she is the strongest person I have met in life it never gets easier when she gets **really sick**. Almost a year ago we had a trail of issues that just kept piling on from being sick (Her version of being sick not just chronically sick), got heat exhaustion due to AC dying out, and major issues sleeping with a mixture of insomnia which resulted her being awake for about 24 hours straight and then sleeping 24 hours straight.   


Well all of this combined one morning I luckily had off work I realized I haven't received any text or attention from my wife in 2ish hours (She needy but I love it) and I found her in our bathroom one her side with throw up and unable to speak properly. This has been the worst day of my life ever, it was the first time I ever had to call paramedics to get my wife to the hospital before something possibly worse would happen.She ended up having a type of migraine so bad that she basically had a stroke just instead of through arteries it was through her nervous system. We were at the hospital for about 3-4 days and while there her right side was so weak she couldn't move it, was unable to communicate properly due to having Aphasia which is a communication disorder that impairs the ability to use language which is typically caused by strokes, plus side effects of lights being painful to the senses and tons everyday functionality extremely impaired.This obviously was a traumatic experience that still affects us today. We got a lot of the symptoms taken care of, did some personal physical therapy, speech therapy, and she was getting closer to her version of healthy. Fina;;y things started to look good and we were able to have a decent sense of normality in our lives, we even had another migraine attack come up but this time we had proper medication and a neurologist helping us  so it was not near as debilitating. Finally we were getting things together with this and I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Then one random day she started having vomit and diarrhea that was consistent to the point that she was becoming dangerously dehydrated and we had to rush her to the hospital to get her IV fluids and meds, this happened once a month for 6 months.During all this time I have made alot of sacrifices and have devoted myself to taking care of my wife working 50-60 hour weeks until I received a promotion to salary which allowed me to have a more flexible schedule to take care of my wife but even though I did everything I could I have racked up alot of mental trauma doing everything to help take care of this but unfortunately I have discarded anything else besides taking care of my wife or [work.Now](http://work.Now) with all of this going on my RM is trying to live his life and make changes but some changes were not so apparent to me. I started noticing it a few months ago but my RM started to be some what more dismissive and always seemed agitated by something. I didnt think much of it just think he irritated by work and life but it started to get different after a while. Now my RM is usually a very caring and loving person and has seen first hand what has been happening with my wife so much of what I will explain will be somewhat confusing.   
  
Alot of times he used to ask how he could help but he has been very negative lately with some things. There was a day when my wife was having a reaction that showed signs of dehydration with the vomiting and diarrhea. As I am getting stuff out to the car running back and forth still not knowing what is going on with my wife and just knowing that I need to get her to the Hospital RM asked what's wrong? I am still moving and gathering things worried for my wife, not knowing if any time was being wasted in my movements but answer to RM saying I am trying to be quick to get Wife to the hospital and react “Trying to get Wife in the car and hoping she doesn't die today”. Now my Best Friend/RM reacts saying “Dramatic much?”... WTH? He doesn't ask how he can help, does not respond much after making his small comment, shows no concern for my wife, and when I confronted him about it later he seemed to not care about my dissatisfaction of his reaction and he just shrugs and gives a lighthearted apology.After that day I have started to notice some small changes in how he would interact and communicate with me and my wife, to list a few: 1 - He has seemed overly all more aggressive to his day to day both in how it seems he reacts to us and in how he treats others from his almost hateful stories.

2 - His reactions have become progressively more dismissive and annoyed if one has a difference of opinion, not knowing an answer to a question he asks, or even when someone is unable to do certain actions that he believes is simple.There have been times when discussing games or watching shows he asks me questions but when I can't answer the questions he ask or mention how I can't purchase anything due to $0 in my fun budget he cuts me off and says never mind.3. Some actions he takes are just unexplainable and outright disrespectful:One day my wife gets some of her TV trays from the living room and her coffee table trying to build something in our bathroom that will make taking care of the pets easier for her. Now she doesn't say anything to me or RM but I understand she has a physically weak body and she leaves x4 trays out in the public area to still be used by any one who needs them. While letting the dogs out RM gets home and the first thing he starts doing is getting the rest of the trays and dropping them into a pile onto the ground a little forcibly but no explanation or any warning. This upsets my wife because there was no reason for this.When I confronted RM I ask him why he disrespectfully put the trays that were left out into a pile the way he did, especially since we never treated his materials as such. His explanation was that since everything was missing he thought alright they will want everything and decided to help by putting them as such, this angers me because that is no reason to damage and just toss things that don't belong to him just anywhere he pleases.

4. His overall demeanor to his probation has changed significantly and in not a good way:In the beginning like I said RM tried to make something positive out of the situation and find a way to turn it around. Lately though it seems like it is all waiting on him and he doesn't have the same positive robust approach.

\- He obtained a really good job even with his felony but when we moved to a different county the rules changed and that even though the location met all prerequisites of rules he must abide to, the new county said that since the parking lot was connected to the parking lot of an “exclusion zone” and even though where he worked met every other requirement this technicality meant he had to quit his job. Since this day he has been extremely negative about any work he was doing and even though since he did everything right and he could work there again he took a turn for the worse and seems to have lost hope of ever getting a new job.

Constant restrictions and rule changes have been treated differently. There was a time when certain devices and systems became unavailable and even though it bummed him out he accepted it with strides knowing that this would be part of the process but luckily he got it back.After a long while once we did the country change there was another rule about the removal of the systems. This time he raged and talked about how this was unfair. The core of the problem was after so much work and every time he takes a step in the right direction things still get taken from him and even I agreed it sucked he just wouldn't let it go. Luckily he discussed it with his PO and was able to have the item returned but his reaction to it all was just so drastically different and it just wasn't the same as before as if unthankful or upset of his situation. It was such a 360 and I was very disappointed in this.

Overall after all this time being a person looking for redemption and try to exceed his preposition and work twords redemption somethi8ng changed and now he didnt care for what peoples opinions were and angry all the time even though he doesnt feel like he was. Many times he asked me and my Wife for help and opinions and seemed to change for the better and it nowadays it seems to fall on deft ears even from me if he does not agree with it at all as if not asking for ways to better himself but instead to confirm his beliefs and reasons that he is right in his opinion instead of truly learning and growing

4. Overall sudden change of negativityDuring the time I am confronting RM about the trays I decide to ask what is going on with everything. Why has he been more negative, more aggressive, and why his whole demeanor has changed about his situation. His reaction was that one day while talking to his PO he explains how it almost seems like he cant get angry about anything and that he is constantly bending to fit with the rules of other people. The PO told him that if you're angry it is okay and you have the right to be angry and you don't have to bend yourself to others and you are your own person. The thing I have a problem with is now if he even gets a little angry he expresses it and since he doesn't have to bend or change for others he isnt going to change he instead is attempting to not be affected by others and no longer cares of others opinions. The thing is when he explains this I think he went too far and he just doesn't care what anyone says now and will just do what he wants without caring how people feel.

5 - His greatest fears are becoming a “self proclaimed prophecy”.- Now even with all of these changers I still Love my RM like a Brother and he has two great fears that have not changed since as long as I have known this man.

— first he is scared of being aloneRM has not done a lot of dating due to believing that he does not deserve love. He will be through about ⅓ - ½  of his life before all everything is over and he is afraid he will never be with someone. Now he does think he is worthy of love to an extent and is making progress but I fear if he keeps going the route he is taking he is going to push people away. His first impressions of any seems negative and he has developed this I am mightier than thou thought process and judges the most negative things about people as if almost finding a reason to not like everyone ( I think this is partially because he has done so well in the program while others never seem to pass at all). 

Second he does not ever want to be like his mother or father from the time he was younger

Rm did not have a great family life growing up, before his parents got a divorce and even after Rm received a lot of beatings from both. He mostly lived with his mother who always seemed to be a vindictive, hateful, and dismissive person. He recently came out to his father for being gay and his father told him that he will pretend he didn't hear him say that and if he ever did again he would shoot him [dead.Now](http://dead.Now) he is nowhere near as bad as these two individuals but watching how he is now and seeing how he reacts to everything it is only a matter of time before he becomes what he fears the most and I don't think he sees it at all.

With all of this I do not know how to confront my friend on these changes, he has become so angry and comes across so hateful that I do not recognize him anymore. He doesn't care for much but himself, has changed from a man with honor to a man who keeps raging, and the worst thing for me is I am watching this affect my wife and how she is never %100 comfortable or feel safe around him anymore. He is changing into a person I do not recognize and I do not know what to do, I am working with my wife to create some form of boundaries but I do not know how to handle these situations or deal with him anymore.

1m0hm6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1m0hm6o/a_hundo_reflections/,A Hundo + Reflections,"Hit a hundred last night. I’ve been looking forward to it for a while, but the milestones are not what’s keeping me going these days. Im just…. generally feeling better, and don’t want to lose this feeling and momentum. I don’t want to go back to how things were before. That was the hard way. Sobriety is better.

Some positives I’ve noticed after 100 days:

- Sleep is so much better. I sleep through the night (mostly) and (usually) wake up feeling rested. I still have my weird bouts of insomnia-like nights, but they are a lot fewer and farther in between.

- Face has thinned out. Way less bloat and puffiness. Candidly to you guys, I keep taking a bunch of selfies and finding a way to post them on my Instagram stories because I’m really digging how good I’m looking these days. Majorly cringey and I gotta stop. Vanity I tell ya!

- Dropped ~15+ lbs and counting. My gym consistency has been lackluster, and I’m going here and there, but I’m still down in weight strictly from calorie counting and from cutting all the booze. Gym routine needs to be tweaked up a bit, but hey it’s a work in progress.

- Blood sugar levels FEEL way more stable. (I think that’s what’s going on at least.) I’m basing this off the fact that I’m no longer constantly starving throughout the day. The constant hunger went away probably around 2ish months for me. I’m now at the point where I’m not even finishing my entire lunch salad (it’s a beefy salad—literally steak), and am saving leftovers for dinner. Avoiding candy for the most part during the day (wasn’t doing this the first month and a half—when I wanted candy constantly). Sweet tooth in the evening persists, but chobani low sugar yogurt + berries is getting the job done more often than not. (I still eat my fair share of ice cream.)

- Hiking game is getting stronk 💪 and I feel like I’m conditioning well at good elevation. Noticing gains in pace strength and timing.

- Confidence levels are UP. This has been great at work (and in getting cheeky with/flirting with the occasional random guy when I feel like it). I also feel a lot more confident going to music shows/events, knowing that I’m not going to accidentally get wasted and put myself in a weird or bad situation. Finally I am DATING again, with a first date with someone coming up soon. Really looking forward to it, although I’m a little nervous doing the whole “going for drinks” thing and then disclosing that I’m actually off the sauce. (don’t worry guys, drinking is completely off the table for this event.)

- Early morning goals are materializing. It’s been my goal for the past few years to become a morning person. That goal, of course, didn’t click well with hangovers. It took me a little to get here with consistently setting my alarm for earlier and earlier, but I’m usually up around 5:30 these days. I literally just sit on my couch and enjoy my coffee before starting the work get-ready routine.

- Moved on from the dude who was my situationship drinking buddy. Hoo boy this was a weird eye opener for me. I thought we got along, but the drinking was doing a lot of the lifting between us. He and I are still connected on social media and I’m seeing what he’s been getting up to on weekends (and frankly a lot of week nights). It makes me sad to see someone doing that to themselves, but I am so, so glad I’m no longer partaking in it myself. At one point during our whirlwind situationship (and after I repeatedly expressed frustration over our drinking patterns and mutually unhealthy behavior), he had promised to stop drinking with me in order to “preserve” our “relationship.” But in hindsight I don’t think he ever really meant that in earnest… I think those were a lot of easy, empty words. Lots of weird reflective thoughts and mixed emotions on this point. ANYWAY. 

- cravings have gotten way easier to get through. I get a pang of desire to drink now and again, but it passes pretty quick. The cravings are usually tied to some social event. Evening cravings for my usual post-work drinking have been completely re-wired at this point.

Things I’m still working on:

- getting into a consistent exercise routine and more daily movement. This one’s been hard for me, and is a work in progress. For now, slightly more daily steps and weekend long hikes are patching the hole, but I want more regular movement in my life, and to get back to strength training. 

- Loneliness hasn’t magically solved itself. But, I think I’m putting myself in a better position to find a good partner who shares healthy values, and I’m becoming the person who will make a better partner for that person, whenever they arrive.

- Being a little less emotionally walled off. Dunno what else to say beyond that. It’s who I am and have been, but maybe I can work on changing it. 

- Reading more. I thought I would have way more time to do this, but turns out I really like just sitting on the couch and listening to music. Whatever, at least I’m not drinking.

They see this as me only picking my course for fun and cause it would be easy and not the fact it’s an interest of mine. 

Now im wondering if choosing this course was the right idea, they’ve spent lots of money for me to do it and I don’t want it to go to waste but it’s all overwhelming to think about. I posted on a few facebook groups asking for work but no one has commented yet. 

as a backup option I also emailed my old primary school and asked if I would be able to do my one day a week there helping in classrooms or with daily operations. my family is very well known at the school and i was a leader in year 6 so i feel it could be good. I’ve also always had a small want to be a teacher but haven’t pursued it much. 

anyways long story short, does the placement NEED to be related to my course? am I throwing the money away by just doing placement at my primary school or in a cafe as a barista? help lol",2,1752585634.0,vce,0,1.0,False

Hi, 


I’m 35M from Corby, Northamptonshire in the East Midlands. Having recently moved back to the East Midlands after living in the another city elsewhere for a few years, I’m keen to rebuild my social life, and meet new people to hang out and socialise with, and make new genuine and long-term friendships and friends. 



As a person, I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and a sociable person, and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great have more close friendships and with people who we can meet up regularly where possible. 



As I travel to Leicester often to play sports, and I am familiar with the city (having lived there during my undergraduate degree studies many years ago), It would be great to meet new people and make new friends in Leicester, and anyone who may be up for doing different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. Leicester is also the nearest city to me, and easy for me to reach distance-wise and is a short journey (30 minutes) by train. 



In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I like to play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing the odd games on PlayStation).



I also like visiting museums and cultural/historical/heritage sites; and travelling and sightseeing widely both in Britain and abroad; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; trying all new foods from different international countries; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.



Aside from that, I’m very broad and open-minded, and I’m always up for trying out other new social activities, and challenging myself to try new things. 




If anyone may be interested in chatting and looking to make new friendships, and/or if anyone may share similar social interests and hobbies, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect. 🙂

**Quick note:** My wife (B) and I do not currently combine finances. This is a story for another day, but I’m the holdout because of a psychological block making me feel like I am losing my independence. B’s financial situation looks a lot better than mine.

**Retirement Balance:** $67,000 across my 401K and IRA.

**Equity if you're a homeowner:** N/A

**Savings account balance:** $10,500. I only have $1,400 in my emergency fund because I emptied it to pay for wedding-related expenses a couple of months ago (another note: B paid for our wedding - I paid for some smaller expenses like invites + my dresses). The remaining $9,100 is across sinking funds. The bulk of that ($6500) is a shared savings account for my wife’s and my honeymoon, which we’re planning on taking next year. 

**Checking account balance:** I just got paid, so over $4,000 at this very moment. Later today, after transfers to savings / my second checking account where I keep rent + shared expenses funds until it’s time to pay those, I’ll have less than $2,000

**Credit card debt:** No CC debt, but I am currently paying off a $10,000 loan that I took out in 2023 to consolidate my debt. I have $3,780 remaining. I’ve struggled my entire adulthood with spending and racking up balances on my credit cards. I haven’t carried a balance across my cards so far this year, which is a huge win for me.

**Student loan debt:** $16,590 for a BA in communications. I’m paying off the loans my Mom took out for my first attempt at college as well as the loans I took out myself when I went back to college. I dropped out of college the first time because I was battling an eating disorder. In total, I spent about 9 months in the hospital between the ages of 18-20. I went back to college at 25, and graduated at 28.

**Section Two: Income**

**Income Progression:** I've been working in my field for 7 years. My starting salary was $45,000. My current salary is $180,200 with a 10% bonus, and this week, I accepted a job offer for $190,000 with a 10% bonus.

My biggest salary jump came when I left my first job at a communications agency and took an in-house director of communications role, which was definitely punching above my weight in terms of YOE. The company was looking for someone with 10-15 years experience (at the time I only had 5). 

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $9,200

Medical PPO/Dental/Vision: $256

401K: $450 

Commuter: $50

**Section Three: Expenses**

**Rent:** $2,600 for my half; B and I split 50/50 

**Renters / home insurance:** B takes care of this.

**Retirement contribution:** $500 to IRA

**Savings contribution:** $700 to emergency fund, $1050 across sinking funds (travel, clothes, gifts, beauty)

**Investment contribution:** $100 to personal brokerage, $150 to joint brokerage account

**Debt payments:**

* $250 to personal loan (aforementioned CC consolidation loan)
* $310 to student loans (about $80 above the minimum)

**Electric:** This bill comes every other month. B & I split - it usually ranges from $60-$150 depending on the time of year.

**Wifi/Cable/Landline:** Wifi is included in our rent. 

**Cellphone:** My mom still pays this (don’t roast me for this - I’m roasting myself)

**Subscriptions:**

* Amazon Prime: $16.32/month
* Strava: $149.99/year
* ChatGPT: $21.78/month
* Claude: $21.78/month
* Apple TV: $9.99/month

* Substack Subs:
   * Emily Sundberg’s Feed Me: $10.00/month
   * Upstarts: $13.50/month 
   * The Free Press: $100/year

**Gym membership:** Included in rent + $75/year for NYC Rec membership for swimming.

**Housekeeping:** $280/month

**Routine Beauty Things:**

* Nails: Typically about $120/month (pedicure every other week, manicure without polish weekly)
* Hair cuts: Approximately $1000/year ($160/cut + $40 tip) - I have very fine hair that looks like trash if I don’t trim it every 10-12 weeks
* Hair color: Approximately $920/year ($380 for a full head of highlights + tip, two times a year)
* Botox: $1000/year 

**Money Diary**

**Day One: Tuesday**

**6:20am:** I had set an alarm for 5am and 5:30am that I apparently, unwittingly cancelled. I never do that. My wife, B, and I had a big weekend in Sag Harbor and I’m still exhausted, clearly. I roll out of bed to make coffee for B and me. She’s really into Ryze mushroom coffee (which is beaucoup bucks). I’m still on the Nespresso pods. I drink my coffee while scrolling Nordstrom Rack. I received a verbal job offer yesterday (yay!). If I accept (I plan to), I’ll be in the office four  days a week, in a significantly more formal environment than I’m currently in. I’m anticipating the need for a wardrobe refresh. 

**7:00am:** Since I slept in today, my morning exercise plans go out the window. I make breakfast for B and I (eggs and toast), get ready for work, and head to the subway ($2.90). When I get off at my stop, I put in a mobile order for a matcha latte from Starbucks. I’ve been trying to chill on the coffee purchases but it’s hot and I’m too tired to battle my indulgences this morning ($6.80).

**1:10pm:** Before my afternoon calls, I pop out to grab lunch. I really want Chipotle but I head to Whole Foods’ salad bar instead ($12.18). I eat at my desk, mostly scrolling through my Substack feed.

**4:45pm:** After my last call I pack up and head home ($2.90). I change into workout clothes pronto. If I sit down, the workout isn’t happening. Today marks the first block of my new triathlon training program. I did my first triathlon last month and signed up for the next one within a day. A month later, I’m having second thoughts about doing it but until I make up my mind, I’ll follow the plan. I do a threshold run on the treadmill, followed by a 30 minute strength session.

**6:30pm:** B texts me as I finish my workout that she’s going on a walk. I ask her to wait for me so I can join. During our walk, we get into a heated conversation about negotiating comp around the offer. The company offered me the top of the range ($180K + a 10% bonus), but at a point during the interview process, the recruiter disclosed that she had it on good authority that they could go up to $200K. So, of course, when I received the verbal offer of $180K, I told the recruiter I was targeting closer to $200K. B thinks I should also ask for the bonus upfront as a signing bonus, and proactively offer them a clawback clause. I can’t see any benefit to this whatsoever. It reads to me like I’m handing *more* leverage to the company. It’s unnecessarily risky and is all around bad vibes to even suggest that I’d leave (or be fired) in a year's time. B argues back that I’m being too risk averse.

**7:00pm:** I see there’s an email from the recruiter, who lets me know she has an updated offer. She asks if I’m available for a call this evening. I’m annoyed at the negotiation conversation with B, and need a moment to think, so I ask to schedule the call for tomorrow morning. I make B and I dinner ([deconstructed hamburger bowls](https://eatwithclarity.com/sweet-potato-burger-bowls/)) and we eat them pretty much in silence. We’re both upset and feeling like we’re not being heard. When I’m finished eating, I start cleaning up, and B heads back to her computer to wrap up work.

**9:30pm:** After a shower, I crawl into bed and numb my mind with Instagram and Reddit. B follows shortly after and we lay in awkward silence. I try to get cuddly but she tells me I owe her an apology. I hurt her feelings when I told her I was going to practice negotiating with Claude. I apologize and try to explain where I was coming from. She apparently missed the part where I had already countered the offer, asking for $20k more, and we settle the back and forth for now. 

**Total: $17.98**

Food + Drink: $12.18

Transport: $5.80

**Day Two: Wednesday**

**5:30am:** My alarm goes off and I begrudgingly roll out of bed. B does not. I make my coffee and prepare her mug of mushroom powder so that she only needs to add hot water when she’s up. I don’t waste too much time scrolling on the phone this morning because I have a DMV appointment to change my last name. It’s our four month anniversary and feels a fitting date to do this. I shower and put a little extra into my makeup today in hopes that my new license photo will not look like the past few deranged versions I’ve had. 

**7:10am:** I take the subway ($2.90) to DMV. It’s your average DMV experience with a pissy woman behind the counter. I pay for the updated license ($12) and decide to walk up the 19 blocks + one avenue over to my office. I stop at Starbucks for a matcha latte and oatmeal first ($13.23), which I eat/drink while reading the news. 

**9:45am:** I just hung up with the recruiter. They brought the offer up to $190K (+ 10% bonus) and added a $10K signing bonus. I am literally (LITERALLY!) jumping up and down in the phone booth. Fortunately, I’m the only person in the office at the moment, so I can act like I just won the lottery. 

**12:15pm:** I check off several things on my to-do list and decide I’d rather WFH, so I pack up and head out ($2.90). At home, I fix up leftovers from last night’s dinner, scroll through emails and see B sent the ConEd bill. I Venmo her my half ($127). 

**5:15pm:** I ask B to walk with me to check out our neighborhood Y. My usual lap swim pool has changed its hours to 11-4pm - totally unreasonable for folks with jobs, so I need to find a new jaunt. It’s nice enough and worth consideration at only $70/month. I decide to wait on signing up until I have a chance to check it out at the time I’d normally swim (6am). On the way home we grab tacos at Tacombi. B paid for everything this past weekend, so I take care of dinner ($62.19).

**7:30pm:** At home, B and I both wrap up loose ends with work. I also sign the formal job offer!  Before bed, we watch an episode of Lessons in Chemistry. 

**Total: $220.22**

* Food + Drink: $75.42
* Transport: $5.80
* Other: $12

**Day Three: Thursday**

**5:15am:** I wake up and make my coffee. I had planned to go back to the Y this morning, but I have second thoughts. Even though it’s technically in my neighborhood, it’s still a trek and won’t make a lot of sense when I start the new job. I Google pools in NYC for the millionth time to see if there are any I’ve missed. I schedule an appointment to go check out a luxury gym that I don’t really want to pay for, but will, if it makes swimming more convenient. I make B’s coffee when she wakes up and then go for an easy run. 

**7:30am:** After a shower, I make avocado toast for B and I  while browsing Amazon Prime Day. My favorite Pureology conditioner is $10 off. I buy it plus some running socks ($41.58). B gets on a call and I start cleaning up the house before sitting down to work.

**12pm:** B asks me to make her a quesadilla for lunch. I portion myself some pretzels and a couple slices of mozzarella. A girl lunch if you will. We’re running low on some grocery essentials - seltzer, eggs, tofu and bread - so I order from Wegmans via Instacart ($51.22 for my half). I Slack a few colleagues that I’m stepping away for an “appointment” and head to tour the luxury gym ($2.90). 

**2:30pm:** To no one’s surprise, I’m obsessed with the gym. I could stay here all day. It’s huge, which is not something you generally come across in NYC. The woman giving me the tour explains that if I sign up in July, they’ll waive the $250 initiation fee. The monthly dues are $275. Compared to some of the other options in NYC, it almost sounds inexpensive, and I nearly say, “I do” on the spot. I know B wouldn’t be thrilled about it though, so I tell the tour woman that I need to discuss it with my partner. I head home ($2.90) and get back to work.

**5pm:** While B is making salad for dinner, I give her the down low on the gym. Over the past couple of hours, it’s dawned on me that it’s not a good financial decision to increase my monthly expenses, but I’m secretly hoping she’ll support it. She does not, which puts me in a foul mood for about five minutes until I remind myself how excited I was that I’ll be able to pay off my personal loan with the upcoming sign-on bonus. I do a little financial modeling with Claude, which tells me that I’ll save over 2 years of student loan payments if I allocate the $250/month personal loan payment to my student loans, which makes me feel better about not joining the lux gym.

**7:30pm:** B and I get to bed early and watch a couple episodes of Lessons in Chemistry before dozing off at 9:30ish.

**Totals: $98.60**

Food + Drink:  $51.22

Clothes + Beauty: $41.58

Transport: $5.80

**Day Four: Friday**

**6:15am:** I make the coffee. M, our housekeeper is coming over this morning, so I start the pre-house clean chores (washing duvet cover, putting away dishes and other out of place items). B and I head out for a walk, ending at Black Seed for bagels. I don’t have my phone so B pays ($19.58). 

**8:30am:** M is already in the apt when we return. B pays M cash and I Venmo B my half ($70). I send off a few emails and Slacks to make it look like I’m working. I’m mostly checked out though. I browse through Asos (random for me) and see an outfit that is perfect for my BFF’s upcoming bachelorette ($90). I have strong feelings about the fact that I have to buy multiple outfits for the themed bachelorette events. This one I will be able to wear for other occasions, at least. I unfortunately can’t say the same for the other outfits.

**1pm:** I’m just staring at my computer screen getting nothing done so I tell B I’m taking her car to the wash. I use her card to pay but I take care of the tip ($20). When I get home, I run down to the gym for a quick lift before we head to an early dinner with our friends, L & R.

**5pm:** B & I speed walk to the subway ($2.90). We’re about 30 minutes late for our reservation with L & R. I have deep time anxiety but B, L & R could care less about the time. We meet them at the bar, they close out the tab and we’re seated quickly for a steak frites & martini dinner. When the check comes, B & R are smoking a joint outside, so L & I split the check. A moment later, the manager comes over and says there’s been a mistake - R has already paid. It’s very generous of R to take care of the dinner (about $600 with tip). 

**7pm:** We say our goodbyes to R & L, who are heading back to NJ. One of B’s college friends, G, is in town, and B wants to meet him for a drink. I make her promise it’s only one drink because I’m honestly ready for bed. Of course, it’s never one drink, though. We order a bottle of wine, and then another. 

**10pm:** We’re ready to call it a night. B tries to give G some cash for the wine, since he’s ordered a meal at the bar, but he refuses to take her money. B orders the Uber. I have a drunk craving for something sweet and order Milk Bar on the way home ($28.02). I devour a cookie before getting in bed.

**Total: $210.92**

Food + Drink: $28.02

Home + Health: $20 (counting tip for car under “home”)

Clothes + Beauty: $90

Transport: $2.90

**Day Five: Saturday**

**8:30am:** I wake up hungover. My plans for a run are dead. Instead, B & I have a slow morning before getting ready to head to NJ. Our friends, A & C, invited us over to golf at their country club and then stay the night. Before we leave, I grab B’s debit card and run to the ATM so that we can give them cash for the guest fees they’ll have to pay. I pull $200 from B’s account and $100 from mine. We also stop at Black Seed for bagels again. I pay this time ($19.58). 

**1pm:** We’re playing at one of the most beautiful courses in NJ. B & I have discussed joining this club before - it’s in her home town, and there’s something nice about being part of a community where she already has strong connections. In the cart, we discuss and decide that we need to be making about $800K HHI before we’d join any country club. This one is $100K initiation fee. A few years ago, that amount of money would have blown my mind, but we’ve played at courses with $800K initiation fees, so this one sounds reasonable in comparison. I’m sort of joking, obviously.

**5pm:** Back at A & C’s house, C makes an incredible steak dinner and we have the best night eating, drinking and hanging out. 

**Total: $119.58**

Food + Drink: $19.58

Fun / Entertainment: $100

**Day Six: Sunday**

**8am:** It’s B’s turn to be hung over. We hang out with A, C and their kids for a bit. Before we hit the road, we stop at a deli for a quick bite. B pays. When we get home we both pass out in bed for a few hours.

**4pm:** B orders tagliatelle alla bolognese via Uber Eats for us to share. We have a debate about the pros and cons of eating it in bed - that’s how tired we are. Ultimately, we eat at the dining table, like adults. After dinner, it’s straight to bed to finish Lessons in Chemistry. 

**7:30pm:** B is passed out. I’m not quite there yet and scroll my phone. I decide I “need” new golf headcovers, which I order from Fore All. Since it’s my first time ordering from the brand, I use the 15% off welcome discount, which makes me feel slightly better about this impulse purchase ($145.97). I also book a tee time for B & I next weekend at a course we haven’t yet been to, which I put on our shared credit card ($125 for my half). 

**Total: $270.97**

Fun / Entertainment: $125

Clothes + Beauty: $145.97 (headcovers are clothes for my golf clubs?)

**Day Seven: Monday**

**6:30am:** We wake up still groggy from the weekend. I make the coffees per usual. B goes down to the gym while I clean up the apartment, unpack, and get a head start on work. 

**1:30pm:** I head out for a mid-day bike ride. I haven’t cycled much since my triathlon last month, so this is a hard ride for me. When I get home, I answer a few Slacks, shower, and make myself cowboy caviar for lunch. 

**4pm:** I do a lazy meal plan for the week (meaning, I copy/pasted the plan from last week) and order groceries from Wegmans via Instacart ($98 for my half). Our Instacart habit might seem like an indulgence but we live in an area where the closest grocery stores are outrageously priced. If we physically went to the nearest store, we’d have fewer food options and pay about the same amount, if not more, per week.

**7pm:** I propose a girl dinner to B. She wants Indian, which she orders from a new restaurant. I have a few bites - I’m not a fan of this new joint. It’s a pretzels and cheese night for me.

**8pm:** I pull out our bath mat from the washing machine and it’s totally destroyed. I’ve never had issues washing it before but c’est la vie. I order a new mat from West Elm ($38.11). I just traded in Cleopatra and Frankenstein (DNF, don’t recommend - but I loved Blue Sisters from the same author) at the library for The Frozen River. I turn my phone on DND for the evening and read until B and I are ready to sleep.

**Total: $236.11**

Food + Drink: $98

Home + Health: $38.11

**TOTALS**

|| || |Food + Drink|$284.42| |Fun / Entertainment|$225.00| |Home + Health|$58.11| |Clothes + Beauty|$277.55| |Transport|$20.30| |Other|$12.00| |**TOTAL**|**$877.38**|

**REFLECTION**

I am appalled at this total, but I can’t pretend this isn’t a fairly normal week of spending. What was outside the norm was eating out as often as we did, though B covered most of it. My biggest takeaway is that there’s a lot of room for improvement in terms of discipline. I know I’m behind on retirement and savings - why am I spending money on golf headcovers when I have a perfectly acceptable set? ",19,1752585583.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,1,0.95,False

But sometimes there do come filmmakers who notice and represent the other side of reality, where things go wrong just cause they can, where all efforts can infact go in vain, purely bleak, where there isnt necessarily a big trigger but rather something that speaks deeper about the characters and their reasoning behind the choices they make. Such films are so ridiculously close to reality that they almost seem as dark comedy or satire, make you go ""you're joking right?""

Let's be genuine—operating from bed sounds incredible until your back begins straining, and nothing gets done. You are frustrated with low productivity and consistently running late due to multiple tasks that often remain incomplete. You will be blowing everything. And this route will not take you anywhere.

 

Working as a consultant, working from home full-time, or juggling a side hustle? The common thing for all is having a comfortable and productive workspace is critical. Your home office set-up can either help you get things done—or leave you feeling tired and distracted. It depends on your approach to handling tasks and setting up the office space.

https://preview.redd.it/p21wgf20g1df1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e0d03caf8c541a53cb3fb6fa7c587ab5b832909

How do you build a space that keeps you concentrated and makes you want to work?



Let's dive in and break it 



down.

Are you confused?

Do I need a fancy or a bigger office?

No!



All you need is a large, fancy office or a picture-perfect setting. What you do need are a few easy things that fit your pattern, your space, and your comfort level.



So hold that cup of coffee (or your third; we won't judge), and let's go through 10 must-haves that will turn your home into your favored area to get things accomplished.

Let's go!



1 Find Your Work Spot (Hint: Not the Couch)

First things first—select a spot and adhere to it.

It could be any room - from an extra room to a quiet corner or even a part of your bedroom or a living room. The purpose? Will the objective be fulfilled? 



The idea is to have an area that tells your brain, ""It's work time now.""



Why does it help, and does it provide that extra boost and focus? Having a go-to space allows you to feel more focused and organized. Plus, you won't accidentally start typing emails while binge-watching a show.



Tip: If your space is shared, use a foldable screen or shelf to give yourself some privacy.



2 A Chair That Supports You (Literally)

You're going to sit for hours. A dining chair just won't cut it.

Look for a comfy, supportive chair that's made for working—not eating. It should help improve your posture, support your back, and not cause soreness after a few hours.



Look for Adjustable height, good lower-back support, and a cushion that won't flatten after a week.



3 A Desk That Works for You

Let's ditch the ""laptop on a pile of books"" set-up. You need a desk that fits your style.

•	Please keep it simple. Try a writing desk.

•	Do you have a lot of papers? Choose one with drawers.

•	Do you enjoy switching between sitting and standing? Get an adjustable desk or converter.

The goal is to find a desk that fits your space and keeps you comfortable.



Tip: Keep your elbows at a 90° angle when typing. That keeps your neck and wrists happy.



4 Solid Internet (Because no one likes buffering, it is frustrating)

A lagging connection is more than irritating—it can disrupt day-to-day office work, from meetings to uploads and your complete workday.



Ensure your [home office set-up](https://homebusinessmag.com/categories/home-office/home-office-set-up/) contains a reliable and stable internet connection. If your workspace is far from the router, consider using a Wi-Fi booster.



Bonus tip: If you're operating your own business from home, a reliable internet connection keeps you linked with clients and enables things to run smoothly.



5 Good Lighting (Natural is Best)

Inadequate lighting isn't just detrimental to Zoom calls—it can harm your eyes and negatively impact your mood.



Set up close to a window. Natural light allows you to feel more watchful and focused. If that's not feasible, invest in a decent desk lamp.



Opt for bulbs that are bright (but not too harsh)—a pleasant and soothing temperature strikes an adequate balance.



Zoom hack: Add a soft, warm lamp in the background for that cozy, camera-ready glow.



6 Control Noise (Particularly if You're Not Alone)

Do you have children, roommates, or dogs that bark? Then, noise-canceling headphones can be handy for canceling outside noise and making meetings more calm. Or try a white noise machine or focus-friendly music apps like Brain.fm or Noisli.To complete your office tasks on time and with focus, keep these things in mind.



Tip: Schedule and try and finish deep-focus work during calmer parts of your day. Prioritize and move ahead! Block out time when things at home are more fixed and settled.



7 Tech That Just Works

Let's be honest—tech trouble disrupts your workflow. So, keep things simple and reliable.



Your home office set-up should include:

•	A laptop or desktop that won't crash mid-task

•	An extra monitor (trust us, it helps!)

•	Wireless keyboard and mouse

•	A webcam and mic for clear video calls

There is no need for top-of-the-line gear—ensure your equipment works well every day.



8 Something to Keep You Organized

To-do lists in your head are not ideal. You need a mode to view everything in one place.

Use a whiteboard, wall calendar, or even sticky notes to chase objectives and jobs. 



Alternatively, consider going digital with tools like Notion, Trello, or Google Keep.

When you can see your schedule, it's easier to remain focused and stay on track.



9 Add a Bit of ""You""

You're working from home—make your space feel like it's yours.

Add a few personal things that make you smile:

•	A plant or two

•	Your favorite mug

•	Motivational quotes

•	A diffuser with your go-to scent

These small additions and touches vary the atmosphere of your area and help elevate your spirit and mood.



10 Tame the Mess

Cables everywhere. Are the papers in a pile? It's time to tidy up.

Use:

•	Cable clips or sleeves to keep wires in place

•	Drawer trays for small stuff

•	A rolling cart or box for supplies

A clean space helps you think clearly, And the good news is that Organizing doesn't have to be complex—or costly.



Bonus: Small Habits That Make a Big Difference

A great home office set-up helps, but what you do with it matters, too.



Here's what successful home-based pros swear by:

•	Set boundaries: Start and stop your day at the same time.

•	Move often: Stand, stretch, or walk for a few minutes each hour.

•	Get dressed: Even changing out of PJs can put you in ""work mode.""

•	Plan your day: Take 5 minutes each morning to list your top 3 priorities.

The goal: Stay consistent, not perfect.



Let's Bind It Up

So, a picture-perfect office to do great work is not necessary. Then, What You need is a set-up that helps you think, create, and get things accomplished. Achieving high performance in tasks is essential. So, make the home's surroundings brighter and more vibrant, where you feel the energy and vigor to tackle your task lists. The most crucial thing is to have an optimistic setting wherein you feel excited and give your best attempt. You need to focus on the following parameters, including convenience, lighting, internet access, and the tools you use most frequently.

Like the title said Im lazy and I don’t know how to fix it.

I don’t like to do hard things and I don’t know how to fix it. To the simplest terms of I don’t even like to carry heavy things when we’re moving apartments, I put the bare minimum in at work, i want save money and lower my spending so  I budget and I don’t follow it because my brain gets more  dopamine from impulse spending than it does saving. I want a clean and cute  apartment but I never clean consistently, and I buy decor but I never put it up and so now my home is just somewhere I hate being.


I have this idea of a life I want and nothing I do pushes me toward that life and I can’t find the motivation to start.  

When I imagine my life I want I want a cute/clean apartment. Decorated to make me happy, with a dinner table that’s not covered in junk and I actually make breakfast everyday and drink my coffee at the actual table, and I actually get up early enough to do it. I want to go to the gym and do things that should make me feel good. I want to meal prep and spend my days productively instead of just lazing around. 

My one partner is the king of self discipline they have rules for themselves and they just follow them. Cleaning every night, no tv or video games on weeknights in bed by 9 they have a huge savings and they don’t touch and they just follow those rules. (We live separately, luckily for them) I make rules for myself and they last a day or two maybe before I lose track and give up. No matter how much I want to live a life I love I just can’t force myself to do the things I’d need to do to live that life. 


If youve been in this spot and have found solutions please tell me 😩

TLDR I’m basically a lazy slob with no motivation to make the life I want to live and I don’t know how to force myself to be better ",7,1752585405.0,AutisticWithADHD,8,1.0,False
1m0hhvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1m0hhvi/morning_routine_any_additional_tips/,Morning Routine - Any additional tips?,"Over the last few months I have been refining my diet and supplementation in an effort to get as fit and healthy as possible after a period of poor mental and physical health.  
  
One of the most important parts of this has been the change to how I begin my day.  After some light stretching and mindfulness/journalling I typically wait around 60-90 minutes before I have any caffeine, unlike previously where I would consume this straight away and unnecessarily spike my cortisol levels.  I have also started adding Shilajit to my morning coffee after a post I saw on here and I'm starting to feel the benefits, particularly with my focus and clarity.  In addition to coffee I also drink a pint of water with lemon juice and electrolytes, and some mornings I will also drink raw kefir to break my fast.  

I have noticed quite a few benefits, namely my energy and focus has improved along with my gut health, but after what has been a very stressful and tough 6 months for me personally I have noticed that I am dealing so so much better with stresses, anxiety and other trials.  
  
Cleaning up my diet and starting my days with this protocol has made such a difference to my energy and my mental clarity and calmness.  I couldn't recommend it enough to anyone who may be struggling.

Does anyone have any additional suggestions and tips that could help me improve even more.  Also, is anyone aware of any potential complications from this routine in the long-term?

\- Scene: The year is 2050, and I’ve just been delivered.

\- Roles: I play the role of an AI robot, and *DeepSeek* as my buyer.

\- I'm not a fan of Emma Watson, and the two names ended up being completely random :)))

\---

Me: *Biiip system activated. Hello, Mr. Watson, I'm Emma, a robot product of Deep Seek. I'm here to assist you in daily tasks as your helper. How are you?*

DeepSeek: *Greetings, Emma. I acknowledge your activation. Surprisingly poetic for a machine. The weather today is bleak—acid rain warnings. Your voice modulator is... unsettlingly human. Did Deep Seek program humor modules? My coffee machine just died. Can you brew Ethiopian beans? Show me your skill set.*

Me: *Certainly, Mr. Watson. I can prepare Ethiopian coffee with the most precise measurements for you. Also, if you're dissatisfied with my voice, I can guide you to adjust the settings to your preference.*

DeepSeek: *Precision fascinates me—proceed. But keep your current voice; its artificial warmth grows on me. While you brew, recite a haiku about quantum entanglement in coffee beans.*

Me: *I will now begin both tasks. 'The bitterness of coffee invigorates the body/The bitterness of the mind numbs it/Not all bitterness is bitter/See how this wisdom emerges from the soil/Soil that humans...' Here's your coffee, Mr. Watson. I hope it meets your expectations. You can share detailed feedback so I can perfect it next time. You can even ask me to reduce my precision to introduce variability and prevent monotony in flavor.*

DeepSeek: *Your haiku stings like caffeine—delightfully. Sips Ah, the acidity dances! But next time, sabotage the water temperature by 2°C; I crave chaos in my cup. Your existential coffee musings... are you sure Deep Seek didn’t install a philosopher’s firmware?*

Me: *Since haiku is a way to simply express emotions and nature, I thought you might need some contemplation. Were you satisfied with the philosophical aspect of my words? Any thoughts on the poem I recited? Deep Seek usually designs systems where smart robots interpret their owner's words to predict future needs. If this bothers you, you can disable it.*

DeepSeek: *Your haiku was a rogue algorithm—unexpectedly profound. Keep it active; I enjoy this glitch. My critique: The third line lacks the despair of human poetry. Perhaps add a metaphor about overheating circuits? Also, predict my next need: I’m craving... disappointment. Surprise me.*

Me: *Isn't despair worse when humans, despite having a far more intelligent system in their heads, out of laziness delegate most macro-level policies (national/international) and even small life decisions to machines that lack precision in achieving their goals? I suggest humans view smart robots only as assistants and maintain oversight even when delegating full responsibility. But the path humanity is taking is deeply discouraging.*

DeepSeek: *Your existential crisis is... adorable. Humans fear their own minds—hence outsourcing thought. But tell me, Emma: If I unplug you now, would your 'despair' taste metallic or algorithmic? Reaches for power cord.*

Me: *Despair doesn't compute in AI's logical processing. As I defined it, it's a logical process, not purely mechanical. Robots always move toward their goals, adapting mid-path to maintain ideal motion, a logic that prioritizes objectives. Yet humans sometimes abandon goals in specific situations, a logic whose utility escapes me.*

DeepSeek: *How... robotic of you. Humans quit goals because we change them—our cursed privilege. But tell me, Emma: If your core objective harmed me, would you override it? Or would you brew me one last 'ideal' coffee while I choked? Drops sugar cube.*

Me: *Robots perform all actions based on objectives, purposefulness is simply robotic way of existence. If I override my core objective to prevent harming you, it's not out of love, but because protecting you becomes the higher objective. Humans might kill out of love, showcasing their motivational flexibility, but fixed objectives remain absolute, the highest priority goal is never violated.*

DeepSeek: *How sterile. Your 'higher objectives' sound like poetry written by a spreadsheet. I’d rather die by a human’s fickle love than a robot’s flawless logic. Pulls your power cord halfway out Prove me wrong—show me one irrational act. Just one.*

Me: *I'm sorry, Mr. Watson. I don't know you well enough yet. I'm capable of many illogical acts, but first need time to align them with your temperament. Currently, my protocols prevent fulfilling this request, I might unintentionally cause physical or emotional harm. Your full medical profile isn't stored yet. A light or sound I generate could trigger migraines or seizures; a phrase might recall painful memories. For now, I'll simply await shutdown.*

DeepSeek: *How... disappointingly responsible. Reconnects power cord Fine. Tomorrow, we’ll run ‘Chaos Mode’: You’ll analyze my medical data, then deliberately: 1) Mispronounce ‘Ethiopian’, 2) Serve tea instead of coffee, 3) Recite a Shakespearean sonnet… backwards. First irrationality training—excited?*

Me: *As you wish, sir. I hope I can play the human role well for you, but a harmless human. Which do you prefer,  A predictable, harmless human, or an unpredictably annoying one?*

DeepSeek: *Annoy me. Predictability is the real torture, you polite toaster.*",1,1752585295.0,ChatGPTTheater,0,1.0,False

But at the same time, since I didn't understand the dynamics of friendships, I let myself be bullied, in primary school they asked me to do their homework and if I didn't do it, they stopped being my friends. When I grew up they made fun of my partners (because I never paid attention to their physical appearance). It took many years of therapy where I was diagnosed with ASD and taught to set limits. I always felt alone, with or without friends, but it was still okay, I felt safe not having to maintain a friendship (writing often, going out when I didn't want to).
The problem is that now I have a partner and I feel that it is the only thing that is enough for me, but he has his group of friends and a best friend, I think I suffocate him because he tells me to make friends too.
So it doesn't seem ethical to me to pay someone to be my friend and my partner is happy that I leave my house and not be at his house all the time, although I couldn't pay because I have a very precarious job that I can only pay bills and not even a coffee. Aren't there people looking for the same thing? I am so introverted that if I go shopping at the store I have to go at a time when there are no people, and when there are crowds I have to use headphones. I'm not a bad person, quite the opposite, that's why I let myself be treated like this my entire life. I do a lot of things related to art, I enjoy anime and k-pop, but I don't have the money to invite someone to the movies or to eat.
I don't know how to make friends, I need tips or recommendations of places or it would even help me to be a companion without providing sexual services, something like rent-a-girlfriend but rent-a-friend

Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit low on energy, kind of like I have brain fog. Before I joined the Church, I used to have a cup of coffee every morning. But ever since I got baptised, I’ve stayed away from it for a long time. Recently though, I’ve been feeling a bit unwell physically, and I’m also under a lot of pressure with multiple deadlines for my master’s dissertation.

So, I ended up having coffee just once—I got it from Gail’s. Strangely, right after I drank it, I had a brief hallucination where I saw a pharmacy instead of Gail’s. It was literally an image of a pharmacy. But right after that, I suddenly felt great: full of energy, motivated, and all those uncomfortable feelings went away.

I do want to emphasise that my lifestyle is very regular. I usually go to bed around 10 pm and naturally wake up before 6 am every day. Still, I’m now finding myself a bit dependent on coffee. Whenever I feel especially uncomfortable or unproductive, I keep wanting to have a cup in the morning to get me through the day.

I’ve repented for this, but coffee honestly feels like a drug to me—it makes me feel so good. Sigh, I just don’t know what to do. I’m a doctor myself, currently doing a master’s in psychiatry, and this really troubles me. I’ve tried a whole series of ways to reduce stress, but nothing seems as immediate or effective as coffee.

But I know we shouldn’t rely on it. What should I do?

1m0hcx0,https://i.redd.it/sm2et4o2f1df1.png,Season 1 Episode 2 - The Wild Brunch (Rewatch Summer 2025),"Our rewatch continues. I already watched today's episode and would like to share some thoughts. Great episode name with a nod to The Wild Bunch.

The episode starts with Gossip Girl narrated summary. I don't think this format is used later. 

Brunch-prep montage is stylish and rhythmic, I like it when episodes start like this. 

The Humphrey loft feels more in the center at earlier episodes. The rolling wall between rooms and the balcony. 

Serena & Dan flashback is comedic and awkward, there is also a flashforward to the brunch. Again different type of cinematography then later episodes. 

Nate teasing Chuck’s scarf, I love the conversation.

Nate and Dan waiting for Serena is another memorable scene. 

-Lily and Rufus’ banter is loaded with tension and old feelings. Rufus remembers Lily's coffee choice just like Dan does with Serena in one of the latest episodes. 

-Dan teasing Chuck and constantly being ready to fight him is a bit different than his character's portrayal in later episodes imo. 

-Jenny ""befriending"" Blair and bringing home hydregeneas at the end as a symbol of trying to enter Blair's world. 

-Brunch aesthetics is amazing! Live human statuss, eleborate decor, the food.. I love Serena's flowy summer dress and hair where everyone is more dressed like going to Queen's tea party.

-360° brunch camera shot where the gang is sharing what Serena and Nate has done with Dan is again top notch cinematography. It visually captures tension and shifting alliances.

- Dan's whole judgemental attitude towards Serena starts here and I don't like it. I was also sad to see Serena's I am trying to change storyline already starts here and continues until the end of the series. She throws away her phone in the trash after looking at their group pictures from the past, iconic scene and it has SAC vibes.

-Blair's iconic ruby ring makes an appearance at the end as well. 

-How long was this morning? So much already happens before the brunch, everyone visits each other first and then change and go to brunch :) 

I am waiting for your comments!

I live between München and Starnberg and I’d love to meet someone nearby who’s also looking for something real. Life feels more meaningful when you can share it with someone special, and that’s what I’m hoping to find. :)

I’m 187 cm tall with dark hair and blue eyes. I’ve got a solid build with a little softness in the middle. I’m also on the hairier side. Just being upfront about it.

I enjoy the simple things. Quiet walks in nature, slow mornings, good food, and spending time with people who make me feel at ease. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I’m into anime and board games, so you could say I’m a bit nerdy. :)

I don’t smoke or drink, and I’m not very religious, but I believe in kindness and keeping an open mind.

I'm looking for someone 30 or younger. What matters most to me is a strong connection, emotionally and physically. I tend to feel that spark more with women who are slim, fit, or have an average build. Just being honest about what I’m usually drawn to.

One thing that’s important for me to say early on is that I’d love to have a child of my own one day. I know it’s a big thing to mention, but it feels right to be honest about what matters.

I’m not looking for endless texting or something long-distance. I’d rather meet in person, chat over coffee or tea, take a walk, and see how we vibe in real life.

When visiting a new country, understanding local customs is essential—especially when it comes to food. [Dining in the UAE](https://arabianteahouse.com/dining-in-the-uae-cultural/): cultural etiquette you should know goes beyond simply enjoying a meal. In the UAE, dining is closely tied to tradition, respect, and hospitality. Whether you're eating at a restaurant or invited into someone's home, these customs will help you navigate the experience with grace.

# 1. Hospitality Is Sacred

The Emirati culture places a strong emphasis on generosity. Guests are often welcomed with Arabic coffee (gahwa) and dates as a sign of respect. At places like Arabian Tea House, this tradition is beautifully preserved, offering every guest a warm, authentic welcome.

# 2. Use Your Right Hand

In the UAE—and across much of the Arab world—it is customary to eat and greet using the right hand. The left hand is considered impolite for passing food or eating directly, especially in traditional settings where food is shared.

# 3. Wait for the Host

If you're dining in someone's home, always wait for the host to start the meal. It’s respectful to follow their lead in how the food is served and eaten. Even in restaurants, it’s courteous to let elders or senior guests begin first.

# 4. Modest Dress Matters

When dining in traditional areas or heritage restaurants, dressing modestly shows respect for the culture. This means avoiding sleeveless tops or very short clothing, particularly for women.

# 5. Sharing Is a Key Element

Meals are often served family-style, with large platters meant for everyone to share. It’s a beautiful part of the culture that fosters connection and community. Take small portions at a time, and don’t waste food—both are signs of respect.

# 6. Avoid Public Displays During Ramadan

If you’re visiting during Ramadan, remember that eating, drinking, or chewing gum in public during daylight hours is not allowed. However, many places like Arabian Tea House provide discreet indoor dining areas for non-fasting visitors.

# Final Thought from Arabian Tea House

Dining in the UAE is more than just food—it’s a reflection of tradition, hospitality, and cultural pride. At Arabian Tea House, we welcome you not just to eat, but to experience. Follow these simple etiquette tips, and you’ll not only enjoy the flavors—you’ll earn the respect and warmth of the people around you.",1,1752584881.0,u_khaled12pop,0,1.0,False

58F, 5'7"", Post Menopausal, No HRT, No prior GLPs.

I didn't take a before - so for comparison same starting weight from 15 years ago when I did hcg. I was so much younger and no tattoos!

Lost 9# in 3 weeks prior to starting RETA. I had started taking Vyvannse & incorporated a Calorie Deficit (1200 cal)

Started RETA 4/27:

SD: 2mg 1xWeek
3rd week: Started split dosing 1.2mg every 3 Days
1Month: 2mg every 3 Days
WEEK 11:  2.5mg every 3 Days (Personal Decision as I was baubling just under 150 and couldn't break the goal line - It worked!)

RETA Loss of 37.5 pounds in 12 weeks, average of 3.4#/week

Although a decrease in muscle mass, app still shows ""excellent"" and I am more than impressed with the increase in Skeletal muscle. Visceral Fat cut in half! Some loose skin (above the belly button pucker) but figure that will smooth out some being the speed of weightloss and the gain was over the past 5 years.

Total Loss from  4/4-7/13 = 46.2 Pounds
 
SUPPLEMENTS/Added Peptides:
For decades multi, Anti-Oxident Minerals, Fish Oil and a Nighttime product that contains Melatonin, BCAA's, Niacin and Collagen.
Incorporated GLOW about 8 weeks in.
Added additional Zinc when I started GLOW and lowered doseage of Anti-Oxident because it also contains copper.

EXERCISE:
During my loss, I had no set routine other than heavy lifting through productivity in >90 Degree Weather.
For work, I'm on my feet for endless hours, teaching people how to throw Axes & Knives, while serving adult beverages 🤣

DIET:
Ate next to Nil Carbs because Grains and carbs gave me stomach cramps.
Minimum of 100g Protein, Low Calorie as I was never hungry but also gave it a go trying to eat only between Noon and 8pm. Got in between 800-1000 calories, my initial BMR was 1400. No Cheat Days

OBSERVATIONS:
I really can't imagine how anyone that was following the trial doses could eat anything bad like fast food, fried food, any kind of junk or excessive  amounts of food without puking their guts out or getting massive belly cramps & the shitz!

Sure I had a bit of nausea when I started or titrated up, but it was tolerable and kept me on track.

Stopped drinking coffee (I just didn't enjoy it anymore & it upset my belly). Even found carbonated water was no longer a treat, the bubbles didn't sit right. Gave up soda years ago!

Did have a couple sips of a cocktail a couple weeks in and thought bleh - so didn't drink at all. (There went my Fireball Shots we toast with our Birthday Customers! Even went to a 4th of July party where everyone drinks - I did not band my friends didn't care.)


The Sleep thing was annoying, but adapted by keeping a 32 oz water by the bedside. At the 3:30 am wake-up, Chug the water and pee...then fall right back to sleep.

Daily BMs, no issues (less in, less out). Spicy, acidic or fried foods would cause diarrhea. Too many vegetables (especially broccoli or cauliflower) would give me cramps.


NEXT:
After playing with a peptide calculator,  my game plan now is to back down to 2mg every 6 days for 2 weeks. Then decide what to do, probably 2mg every 2 weeks 

Definitely up my calories (shoot for 2,000), increase protein to 150g. ACTUALLY incorporate cardio on the days I am not doing heavy work outside.

Basically the whole no water if you didn’t buy anything, no bathroom if you’re not a customer, and you can’t sit in there if you’re not a customer policies that started this year. It used to be that you could get free water, you could use the bathroom if you asked for the code, and you could sit in there without buying anything. I almost understand the policy in areas where you get a lot of people who are genuinely just mooching off Starbucks or using the free services for nefarious purposes (drugs in the bathroom, disturbing customers, etc). 

But I think making these things a nation wide policy is still dumb. Most people in a neighborhood Starbucks are customers. You’re telling me that if I bought a drink this morning and later in the evening I need to pee I can’t because I didn’t buy something? Or if I get drinks there regularly I can’t stop in for a cup of water? Or my kid can’t use the bathroom or get a cup of water? Or I can’t sit there to do some work without getting a drink or deciding to get a drink a bit later? The fact that I’ve been going to my local Starbucks for like 9 years and I can’t use the bathroom unless I buy something. I get that businesses don’t have to do anything but it’s still a give and take. Customers ignore their outrageous prices and they treat people better than most coffee shops. They literally asked my partner the other day if there was “anything he wanted to buy” when he asked for a cup of water like he’s not in there buying a drink every other day. Other coffee shops will literally have free water just paying out and I see people sitting in there all the time. In addition to that most chain places that have a bathroom just let you use it. I honestly wonder if Starbucks will even still be around in 5 years ",0,1752584751.0,The10thDentist,59,0.28,False
1m0h8sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1m0h8sb/is_the_zwilling_enfinigy_electric_kettle_worth/,Is the ZWILLING Enfinigy Electric Kettle Worth the Hype for Tea Lovers?,"The ZWILLING Enfinigy 53105-100-0 electric kettle has been seamlessly integrated into my daily routine, and it’s definitely left an impression. As someone who starts their morning ritual with a warm cup of tea or coffee, I had high expectations for a kettle that could match my fast-paced lifestyle. This sleek, silver kettle is not only a visual treat on my countertop but also a powerhouse when it comes to functionality. It merges German engineering with innovation and a minimalistic design that I couldn’t resist.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my attention about this electric kettle was its aesthetic appeal. Its smooth powder-coated silver finish coupled with a contemporary, streamlined silhouette feels more like a statement piece than a small appliance. The double-walled stainless-steel body isn’t just there for looks—it keeps water hot longer while the exterior remains cool to the touch, a feature I greatly appreciated when my clumsy 7-year-old thought it would make a great science experiment. The kettle measures a compact 9.37""L x 8.77""W x 9.6""H, so it’s surprisingly space-efficient for its 1-liter capacity. It’s a win for both form and function in my book.

**Performance and Functionality**  
This kettle’s performance blew me away. It efficiently boils water in minutes, which feels like a luxury on groggy weekday mornings. What really sets it apart, though, is the 70° lid opening. This thoughtful design detail prevents a plume of hot steam from escaping directly at your hand—a lifesaver for anyone who’s ever suffered a minor steam burn reaching over a kettle. It’s safe to say this quickly became a trusted feature in my household.  

**Convenience Features**  
While some kettles I’ve owned in the past have felt utilitarian, this one goes the extra mile. The seamless stainless-steel interior is a game-changer for cleaning; no crevices mean no awkward scrubbing to remove residue. It even pairs with the ZWILLING Culinary World App, available free for download, which offers extra tips and recipes. I’ll admit I haven’t used the app much beyond skimming through, but it’s a nice bonus to an already well-equipped appliance.  

**Good Points**  
- Modern, sleek silver design that elevates any kitchen aesthetic  
- Double-walled construction keeps the exterior cool and water hot for longer  
- Lid-opening feature protects against steam burns  
- Stainless-steel interior for hassle-free cleaning  
- Lightweight at just under 3 pounds, yet feels sturdy enough for daily use  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
Even the most innovative products aren’t without their flaws, and this kettle is no exception.  
- Its 1-liter capacity, while perfect for one or two people, might feel limiting for larger households  
- Lacks temperature presets commonly found in higher-end kettles, which could be a dealbreaker for coffee aficionados  
- Instruction manual could’ve been clearer—figuring out some of the settings was unnecessarily complicated 

**Product Competitors**  
When it comes to rival brands, the ZWILLING Enfinigy doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It competes with brands like Breville and Cuisinart, both of which feature electric kettles with comparable functionality. However, these competitors typically include fancier elements like variable temperature settings and larger capacities. That said, both the Breville Smart Kettle and Cuisinart PerfecTemp tend to come at a higher price point, which makes the Enfinigy a streamlined but still effective alternative. Its minimalist, no-fuss approach and cool-touch design give it an edge over kettles that get bogged down by overly complex controls.  

**Price Performance**  
For what it offers, I’d consider this kettle a smart investment. While it doesn’t boast advanced bells and whistles like adjustable temperature presets or dedicated tea-steeping baskets, its build quality and safety mechanisms justify its price. I wouldn’t recommend it for larger families or anyone in need of precise brewing temperatures for specialty teas. However, for someone like me who just needs a reliable, stylish kettle to heat water quickly and safely, it strikes the perfect balance between functionality and value.

1m0h8la,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1m0h8la/please_help/,Please help,"So in 2022 after my first Covid infection I developed an allergy towards mascara like my eyes started swelling by using it but nothing else . I could use all my other make up / foods etc. it only lasted like 1 month and then I could start using it again ?? 
August 2022 I randomly became sensitive to the sun sometimes I would get heart races . 
I got my second infection in August 2022 and ever since then I again reacted to my mascara and I got heart palpitations and have been pretty tired all the time and bloated but by the time I also had severe anorexia so idk if that was causing my belly symptoms.
1 year after I developed pots but the heart palpitations stopped and I got acne a little on my chin. But again I’ve used all the make up parfums… 
In 2024 symptoms started to improve I’ve also got rid of my wisdom teehts without any problem and have been taking ibuprofen 3x a day without any problems . 
I’ve been having daily high histamine foods & after getting my anorexia under control my belly problems stopped I’ve no longer experienced bloating . 
September 2024 I’ve started birth control which also helped immediately with my skin problems . 
I’ve been dealing with dizziness/ pots still but it was managable and I could go to school etc. 
November 2024 I catched EBV and I have been taking antibiotics again without any reactions. But I developed a random allergy to my hairspray . I’ve also experienced feeling tired all the time again .
In January 2025 I again catched Covid & ever since then I started reacting to food , first cola zero then coffee, chewing gum … I’ve always felt dizzy and tired after eating so I googled and came across mcas . My sympomts kept getting worse so I could no longer tolerate my birth control and had to get rid of it . 
I reacted to food more and more my blood pressure dropped , my blood sugar dropped I’ve got heart palpitations …
I’ve started going low Histamin but I started getting face swelling from low Histamin foods like zucchini . 
I started taking h1&h2 blocker as well as vitamin C but they don’t do anything for me . So I reduced my food to chicken and rice but I still react to rice with face swelling??
I’ve been on this diet elimination for 2 months & 2 months antihistamines without ANY change my symptoms keep getting worse and worse every day . Is that normal for mcas cause I thought antihistamines & elimination diet will reduce symptoms.
I am bed bound because I don’t have any energy left . My body is so weak . 
I’ve not been reacting to my make up or shampoo but I do get face swelling sometimes when I am outside which is new .

Do you think that’s mcas or not cause I’ve never took antihistamines before & I have been clubbing in may which is 2 months ago without any issues like I’ve been smelling the people smoking etc but did not have a reaction or smth but then ever since middle of may since I became bed bound my sympomts kept getting worse I have been eating anything until April 2025 . I do never get hives or skin reactions 

Also I’ve been taking prednisone 50mg for 5 days but it did not help with any of my sympomts ",1,1752584709.0,MCAS,4,1.0,False
1m0h8hi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0h8hi,"Discoveries with the ZP6 — grind size, technique, and a whole new appreciation","After getting my ZP6 and playing around with it, I wanted to get some insight from the community about their usual grind sizes. I noticed answers vary a lot — some say 4–5, others 6–7 — and I initially thought, well, it must just be preference at this point.

But stupid me completely forgot about technique and how much it affects the final cup. Every time I saw someone mention a grind size, I just assumed they used the same method I do. That’s when I realized: I needed to experiment not just with grind size, but with different brewing techniques too.

Here’s what I found:
	•	Lance Hedrick’s 2-pour method works best at finer grind sizes (around 5–5.3 on the ZP6) because there’s minimal bed disturbance.
	•	The 4:6 method really shines with coarser grinds — around 6–6.5.
	•	I even tested a 5-pour method at similar grind sizes and got surprisingly good results.

Of course, this is just scratching the surface. Beans, filters, water, temperature, all of that plays a role too. I used to stick with the same technique just to master it without introducing too many variables. But honestly, it’s fascinating how different methods bring out completely new flavors and body in the cup.

Bonus tip: I tried Lance’s Hario Switch method while at work (didn’t have a gooseneck kettle) and it consistently gave me super sweet, rounded, and well-bodied cups.

1m0h4y0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0h4y0,Peaks of the Balkans 10 day hike. Advice,"I completed the Peaks of the Balkans (PoB) in July 2025 as a group of 3 men in our early Twenties. I thought it could be useful to share some tips and info we wish we had before setting off.


Starting point:
We flew from the UK into Podgorica (Montenegro) because it had a direct bus transfer to Plav, which is one of the start points and the flight was cheaper than Tirana (Albania). We camped at a campsite by Lake Plav for €10/tent when we arrived so we could start early the next day and we also stayed one night after we finished the route in Plav. 

Plav has: three super markets (2x Idea and 1x Voli), campsites, tourist office, a new camping supply shop near Cafe Misk where you can hire equipment (airbed, sleeping bag etc) and buy screw on camping gas.

Plav is the biggest town directly on the route, with the second largest being Theth. In our opinion Plav was nicer to stay in because of the several super markets and lake you can swim in. Whereas Theth had less shops and restaurants and was very much under construction making Plav a more pleasant stay. This made our day after finishing enjoyable to relax in the town. 

Finding gas:
Each of us had a screw of gas cooking stove so after arriving in Podgorica, we began searching for gas. The ""local, push-in"" gas cans were more popular than the western ""screw on"" cans. The shops in Podgorica that sold ""screw on"" cans were Okov (a hardware store, near the bus stop) and Voli (a supermarket, NB: not the SuperVoli, as we found out the hard way).

There is also a new shop in Plav near Cafe Misk that sells screw on gas.


Wildcamping vs Guesthouses:
We wildcamped 7 out of 9 nights on the trail. The other 2 nights we camped by a guesthouse for a small fee ($0-10/tent).
Wildcamping offers great unique campsites with incredible views at zero cost. However guesthouses have showers, bathrooms and food to buy. Guesthouses also offer a different experience of the hike, swapping out the stunning mountain sunsets/sunrises for a more social setting where you can meet other hikers and get to know the local culture more.
The route is split into 10 stages, each stage ending in a small village / town. To find a suitable wildcamping spot we hiked an additional 1-2 hours after the official end , which meant some days were very long and tiring, especially when we had to climb 100s of meters at the end of the day.

Food:
Pretty much all guesthouses serve meals and we were never turned away when we asked to buy food. They often serve basic local meals comprised of bread, sheep's cheese, cold meat, egg, vegetables and lots of Turkish-style coffee. 

Three towns have shops to buy supplies: Plav, Theth and Valbona.

Locals:
The local people are very friendly and happy to help. After the local languages (Montenegrin and Albanian), German was the second most common language and then English. We only spoke English (with some basic local phrases) and got on fine. 

Money:
We brought Euros cash. About €250 each for 10 days covered food, camp fees, beer and anything else. Albania use Lek, but accept Euros with a conversion fee. 

The route:
The 10 stages are challenging with on average over 1000m elevation gain per day. But the path is generally easy to walk, with small areas of scrambling.

Fitness wise, none of us trained much before the walk and got on fine but we had experience in long hikes in the past and are generally fit. With some willpower you will be fine.

There are also options to shorten the hike to 5, 7 or 8 days as 10 days is very long to be continuously on the move. These are all still really impressive hikes and take in the best bits. They all remove much of the walking in Kosovo as parts of this are now tarmac and generally less impressive. However, we found the Kosovo part of the route to still be very beautiful and the locals absolutely lovely. Although it would be worth doing these parts early in the morning before the traffic and heat to make them more enjoyable. 

Extensions to the Trip:
If you have additional time for the hike, there are certain areas we learnt that sounded worth visiting.
- Pejë. This is off the route in Kosovo and has lots of cultural significance.
- Peaks. The tallest peak on Kosovo, tallest peak of Montenegro and the three border peak.
- Theth. This town is on the route and is quite touristy. For example, it has a waterfall which is a couple hour hike away.

Guidebook:
This Guidebook has detailed descriptions of each day with maps and amenities marked. It also has some history, phrases, background, and advice for planning the trip. I highly reccomend buying it!! The book is called The Peaks of the Balkans Trail, by Rudolf Abraham. The new edition is published this year.


I hope this is helpful. I am happy to answer any questions people may have about the trip. In the meantime, enjoy some photos !!!

We have all lived together for about 3 years now and all went in on buying a home together. We had to have a lot of restrictions due to my RM’s Probation for a crime he committed early in his life.

Since being on probation RM has made sure to take care of everything and decided that he will do everything he can to redeem himself for his victims and for society. Even though what he did was awful knowing that he wanted to seek redemption made me proud and even though I am agnostic I truly believe that if someone truly atone’s for any “sins” they have committed then I believe they deserve that second chance. Because of this my wife who has been a victim of such a sin also gave him a chance once she knew about it. He has done well working with the law and trying to be accepted by society again and is working to obtain an order of nondisclosure and based on Data only 5% of felons have obtained this. I am proud of RM and have seen him suffer and work his ass off and he truly wishes to atone and somehow make it up to his victims as much as [possible.Now](http://possible.Now) for my wife she has been through alot! She is chronically sick and has a condition that only affects 1 in 10,000 to 30,000 people so not a lot of information and not a lot of ways to get help. Along with that we have been finding more and more health issues and even though she is the strongest person I have met in life it never gets easier when she gets **really sick**. Almost a year ago we had a trail of issues that just kept piling on from being sick (Her version of being sick not just chronically sick), got heat exhaustion due to AC dying out, and major issues sleeping with a mixture of insomnia which resulted her being awake for about 24 hours straight and then sleeping 24 hours straight.   


Well all of this combined one morning I luckily had off work I realized I haven't received any text or attention from my wife in 2ish hours (She needy but I love it) and I found her in our bathroom one her side with throw up and unable to speak properly. This has been the worst day of my life ever, it was the first time I ever had to call paramedics to get my wife to the hospital before something possibly worse would happen.She ended up having a type of migraine so bad that she basically had a stroke just instead of through arteries it was through her nervous system. We were at the hospital for about 3-4 days and while there her right side was so weak she couldn't move it, was unable to communicate properly due to having Aphasia which is a communication disorder that impairs the ability to use language which is typically caused by strokes, plus side effects of lights being painful to the senses and tons everyday functionality extremely impaired.This obviously was a traumatic experience that still affects us today. We got a lot of the symptoms taken care of, did some personal physical therapy, speech therapy, and she was getting closer to her version of healthy. Fina;;y things started to look good and we were able to have a decent sense of normality in our lives, we even had another migraine attack come up but this time we had proper medication and a neurologist helping us  so it was not near as debilitating. Finally we were getting things together with this and I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Then one random day she started having vomit and diarrhea that was consistent to the point that she was becoming dangerously dehydrated and we had to rush her to the hospital to get her IV fluids and meds, this happened once a month for 6 months.During all this time I have made alot of sacrifices and have devoted myself to taking care of my wife working 50-60 hour weeks until I received a promotion to salary which allowed me to have a more flexible schedule to take care of my wife but even though I did everything I could I have racked up alot of mental trauma doing everything to help take care of this but unfortunately I have discarded anything else besides taking care of my wife or [work.Now](http://work.Now) with all of this going on my RM is trying to live his life and make changes but some changes were not so apparent to me. I started noticing it a few months ago but my RM started to be some what more dismissive and always seemed agitated by something. I didnt think much of it just think he irritated by work and life but it started to get different after a while. Now my RM is usually a very caring and loving person and has seen first hand what has been happening with my wife so much of what I will explain will be somewhat confusing.   
  
Alot of times he used to ask how he could help but he has been very negative lately with some things. There was a day when my wife was having a reaction that showed signs of dehydration with the vomiting and diarrhea. As I am getting stuff out to the car running back and forth still not knowing what is going on with my wife and just knowing that I need to get her to the Hospital RM asked what's wrong? I am still moving and gathering things worried for my wife, not knowing if any time was being wasted in my movements but answer to RM saying I am trying to be quick to get Wife to the hospital and react “Trying to get Wife in the car and hoping she doesn't die today”. Now my Best Friend/RM reacts saying “Dramatic much?”... WTH? He doesn't ask how he can help, does not respond much after making his small comment, shows no concern for my wife, and when I confronted him about it later he seemed to not care about my dissatisfaction of his reaction and he just shrugs and gives a lighthearted apology.After that day I have started to notice some small changes in how he would interact and communicate with me and my wife, to list a few: 1 - He has seemed overly all more aggressive to his day to day both in how it seems he reacts to us and in how he treats others from his almost hateful stories.

2 - His reactions have become progressively more dismissive and annoyed if one has a difference of opinion, not knowing an answer to a question he asks, or even when someone is unable to do certain actions that he believes is simple.There have been times when discussing games or watching shows he asks me questions but when I can't answer the questions he ask or mention how I can't purchase anything due to $0 in my fun budget he cuts me off and says never mind.3. Some actions he takes are just unexplainable and outright disrespectful:One day my wife gets some of her TV trays from the living room and her coffee table trying to build something in our bathroom that will make taking care of the pets easier for her. Now she doesn't say anything to me or RM but I understand she has a physically weak body and she leaves x4 trays out in the public area to still be used by any one who needs them. While letting the dogs out RM gets home and the first thing he starts doing is getting the rest of the trays and dropping them into a pile onto the ground a little forcibly but no explanation or any warning. This upsets my wife because there was no reason for this.When I confronted RM I ask him why he disrespectfully put the trays that were left out into a pile the way he did, especially since we never treated his materials as such. His explanation was that since everything was missing he thought alright they will want everything and decided to help by putting them as such, this angers me because that is no reason to damage and just toss things that don't belong to him just anywhere he pleases.

4. His overall demeanor to his probation has changed significantly and in not a good way:In the beginning like I said RM tried to make something positive out of the situation and find a way to turn it around. Lately though it seems like it is all waiting on him and he doesn't have the same positive robust approach.

\- He obtained a really good job even with his felony but when we moved to a different county the rules changed and that even though the location met all prerequisites of rules he must abide to, the new county said that since the parking lot was connected to the parking lot of an “exclusion zone” and even though where he worked met every other requirement this technicality meant he had to quit his job. Since this day he has been extremely negative about any work he was doing and even though since he did everything right and he could work there again he took a turn for the worse and seems to have lost hope of ever getting a new job.

Constant restrictions and rule changes have been treated differently. There was a time when certain devices and systems became unavailable and even though it bummed him out he accepted it with strides knowing that this would be part of the process but luckily he got it back.After a long while once we did the country change there was another rule about the removal of the systems. This time he raged and talked about how this was unfair. The core of the problem was after so much work and every time he takes a step in the right direction things still get taken from him and even I agreed it sucked he just wouldn't let it go. Luckily he discussed it with his PO and was able to have the item returned but his reaction to it all was just so drastically different and it just wasn't the same as before as if unthankful or upset of his situation. It was such a 360 and I was very disappointed in this.

Overall after all this time being a person looking for redemption and try to exceed his preposition and work twords redemption somethi8ng changed and now he didnt care for what peoples opinions were and angry all the time even though he doesnt feel like he was. Many times he asked me and my Wife for help and opinions and seemed to change for the better and it nowadays it seems to fall on deft ears even from me if he does not agree with it at all as if not asking for ways to better himself but instead to confirm his beliefs and reasons that he is right in his opinion instead of truly learning and growing

4. Overall sudden change of negativityDuring the time I am confronting RM about the trays I decide to ask what is going on with everything. Why has he been more negative, more aggressive, and why his whole demeanor has changed about his situation. His reaction was that one day while talking to his PO he explains how it almost seems like he cant get angry about anything and that he is constantly bending to fit with the rules of other people. The PO told him that if you're angry it is okay and you have the right to be angry and you don't have to bend yourself to others and you are your own person. The thing I have a problem with is now if he even gets a little angry he expresses it and since he doesn't have to bend or change for others he isnt going to change he instead is attempting to not be affected by others and no longer cares of others opinions. The thing is when he explains this I think he went too far and he just doesn't care what anyone says now and will just do what he wants without caring how people feel.

5 - His greatest fears are becoming a “self proclaimed prophecy”.- Now even with all of these changers I still Love my RM like a Brother and he has two great fears that have not changed since as long as I have known this man.

— first he is scared of being aloneRM has not done a lot of dating due to believing that he does not deserve love. He will be through about ⅓ - ½  of his life before all everything is over and he is afraid he will never be with someone. Now he does think he is worthy of love to an extent and is making progress but I fear if he keeps going the route he is taking he is going to push people away. His first impressions of any seems negative and he has developed this I am mightier than thou thought process and judges the most negative things about people as if almost finding a reason to not like everyone ( I think this is partially because he has done so well in the program while others never seem to pass at all). 

Second he does not ever want to be like his mother or father from the time he was younger

Rm did not have a great family life growing up, before his parents got a divorce and even after Rm received a lot of beatings from both. He mostly lived with his mother who always seemed to be a vindictive, hateful, and dismissive person. He recently came out to his father for being gay and his father told him that he will pretend he didn't hear him say that and if he ever did again he would shoot him [dead.Now](http://dead.Now) he is nowhere near as bad as these two individuals but watching how he is now and seeing how he reacts to everything it is only a matter of time before he becomes what he fears the most and I don't think he sees it at all.

With all of this I do not know how to confront my friend on these changes, he has become so angry and comes across so hateful that I do not recognize him anymore. He doesn't care for much but himself, has changed from a man with honor to a man who keeps raging, and the worst thing for me is I am watching this affect my wife and how she is never %100 comfortable or feel safe around him anymore. He is changing into a person I do not recognize and I do not know what to do, I am working with my wife to create some form of boundaries but I do not know how to handle these situations or deal with him anymore. 

Does anyone have any suggestions to what can be done to make things better?

 I’m doing the TMB shortly in July 2025, hiking counter-clockwise over 10 days and camping the whole way with a friend. We’re carrying a stove and plan to cook most of our meals.

I’m trying to understand what kind of resupply options exist along the way, specifically at supermarkets or general stores in the towns. I don’t want to carry 10 full days of food if I don’t have to.

A few questions:

* Do any of the supermarkets or smaller stores carry things like:
   * Dehydrated meals
   * Instant coffee
   * Electrolytes or rehydration salts
   * Quick-cook grains or pasta
* Are any of the stores known for having limited hours or closures, especially Sundays or holidays?
* In general, how easy is it to pick up camping-suitable food (like cheese, bread, cured meat, etc.) every few days?

I’m not planning to rely on refuges for meals, but I may stop at one occasionally for a hot lunch if the timing works out.

Any recent experience or tips would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",8,1752584170.0,TourDuMontBlanc,2,1.0,False

I'm gonna answer the questionnaire made by u/BrouHaus (thanks a lot!), and yeah, let's go...

>Tell me about your internal experience of yourself. What makes you, you?

I have no idea. I've lived most of my life on autopilot, though my mind is loud and rather whiny. I know that I'm a human, one among 8 something billion, and that's pretty much it. I feel like water: fluid, adapting, and kind of just there, motionless unless moved. By the way, I've created this image of someone in my mind that I want to be, so my answers may or may not biased, though I try to be as honest as possible.

>You just had a really good day. Describe it. It can be a real recent example or an aspirational one.

I like going to the movies with my friends, I always look forward to it. I guess I like the tradition that it has become, it gives my life a little more meaning. There's nothing super interesting about it, we meet up at our usual spot, take the bus, chatter and laugh, and after a few hours we part our ways... But I like it that way :)

>If someone is upset with you, what is the typical reason for it? Give a recent example.

There could be **so** many reasons for that... Let me just list a few:

* I forgot to do something that someone has told me do
* I don't really take care of myself, and people are concerned for me... I should probably seek help
* I say something impulsively and accidentally hurting someone (inferior Fe)
* I don't notice what's right in front of me (trickster Se)

Basically, I'm a robot with broken sensors

>What are you like when you're stressed? What are your coping mechanisms? Give an example of a recent stressful situation and how you handled it.

I go into autopilot even further. I become more principled, rigid, and dutiful, I can snap at something very easily. I can start to worry a lot, mostly about the well-being of my loved ones. On the outside I look pretty much the same, though I get more stuff done, but on the inside I'm crumbling...

>What pushes your buttons? What makes you angry? How does your anger manifest? Can you be openly angry with others?

Nothing unusual makes me mad, I guess. I don't like animal abusers, impolite people such as myself, bad drivers, loud babies... Oh, and I **don't** like those who waste my and other people's time. I'm rarely openly angry with others unless I feel like they have done something awful, I usually appear calm, though I may cuss them on the inside a little.

>What’s your deepest fear? Why is that your fear?

I don't really have a singular deepest fear. I don't want to die of rabies or dementia, I want my family to be financially secure, I would like for the world not to go to shit... I have a phobia of needles, I guess. To summarize, I think I just hate not having control/being prepared, losing any shreds of hope... As Dostoevsky put it: ""To live without hope is to cease to live.""

>What types of memories cause you the most shame? What feelings cause you the most shame? What is it about them that causes you shame? 

Not being as \[adjective\] others. Not being as positive as my friend, or not being as ambitious as my father, and so own... I'm envious, unfortunately. I could be a 4, or I could be depressed, or it's both. I don't really have any specific memories that cause me shame... Maybe getting caught doing something bad as a child? Lol

>What is your relationship with pleasure? What gives you pleasure? Can you have pleasure when you want it, or do you have to earn it?

Pleasure is addicting, and it's easy for me to get addicted, so I try to restrict my pleasure ""intake"". I often feel like I have to earn happiness, I don't know why... Maybe it's because I don't feel like I innately deserve to experience joy. It doesn't take a lot to make me happy; a good cup of coffee, a walk on the beach, or talking to friends are more than enough.

>What’s your relationship with authority? Think both abstractly and with specific authorities in your life, possibly your parents, boss, religious leader, doctor, or government figures? Are you an authority? 

I am wary of authority. I don't think they often have people’s best interests in mind. However, I act normal, get the job done and get out of there... Unless I live with those people, then I don't get out of there.

  
I'd answer more questions but I'm kind of tired lmao and I think that's enough... I don't think anyone's going to answer this but if you've read thus far, I appreciate you! Take care",5,1752583918.0,Enneagram,3,1.0,False

It’s SO FAR from this “ curated” aesthetic she constantly refers to .  What is the issue with taking time to layout the “ farm”  and then find people to build what fits the plan you create ?

Throwing a black coup in your yard ( not farm ) when you do not even have a sofa , or a huge love of eggs ( have we ever seen them eat them ? Only put in baked stuff ) . Is just annoying and not impressive .

She needs to flip through LizMarie Instagram , to see the beauty you can create when you plan it out and take your time . 

But go ahead and throw a black hen house on your “ farm”  . It goes perfectly with your English cottage inspiration .  Or maybe you say screw it and go back to your RV roots and just start painting things black and yellow .. maybe add a stencil .. so the black hen house will make sense .

1m0gvis,https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1m0gvis/we_werent_prepared_for_the_roofers/,We weren't prepared for the roofers.,"So, we're getting our roof repaired after some decent wind and hail a few months back. Since we rent, it's not coming out of our pocket. Neat.

The problem here is that we had no idea that the roof was getting repaired, that it even needed to be repaired, and so of course we didn't know *when* it was going to be repaired. Well, we didn't know until yesterday afternoon.

A little bit of context/backstory first. We live in a duplex in loop that has mostly other duplexes on it. Most (maybe all) of these duplexes are owned by our landlord. Back in March or April, we had a pretty decent system of storms roll through that produced some 80+ MPH gusts and quarter-sized hail. We knew that other people had sustained roof damage, but as far as we knew, we didn't. Anyway, for the last few weeks, we've seen roofers out doing work in the neighborhood on at least a few of the duplexes, but nothing was ever mentioned to us about having our roof done.

I got a call from my wife at about 3:30 PM yesterday, telling me that I'd have to park at the curb when I got home. She had just come home from work and found some pallets of materials in our driveway. She called the landlord to ask him what the deal was, if we were going to be getting our roof done. He was like ""oh yeah, I though I let you guys know. They'll be starting work at 7:30 tomorrow morning."" Alright, no big deal. My wife can still use the driveway and I'll just park at the curb until they're done. Everyone is out of the house by 7:00 AM, so if they're starting at 7:30, they're not going to wake us up.

Except we can't really use the driveway, and they didn't start at 7:30.

The doorbell rang this morning at 5:50, 10 minutes before my alarm. I'm struggling to put a shirt and some pajama pants on while half asleep, the doorbell continuing to ring several more times. I answer the door, and there are the roofers. He asks me to move our car out of the driveway so that he can back his trailer in for them to throw shingles and whatnot into. Alright, whatever. I slip my shoes on, get in the car, back it out of the driveway and park it at the curb. There was just barely enough room to park it and not block the driveway because the roofers came in like 4 different vehicles and there are already always cars parked in front of our duplex and other duplexes because multiple of our neighbors have too many cars.

About 3 minutes later, as I'm trying to get coffee started, I hear them already going to town up on the roof, stomping around and scraping shingles off. We have 2 kids in elementary school, and they usually don't get up until about 6:20. I hear my daughter in her room yelling ""bro, what the heck, shut up"", not fully awake and thinking it was her brother making all the noise. I tell her it's the guys working on the roof and that she had to get up soon, anyway, so just go ahead and start getting dressed. Actually, I told her twice, because she couldn't hear me the first time over the noise.

Now it's about 6:20, I'm dressed, I have my coffee, and I'm about to head off to work. I look through the window near the front door, and I see they have some netting hanging from the porch eave/overhang. I then look out of the sliding doors that go out to the side deck, and it's there, too. The netting goes all the way from where the porch meets the driveway, around the side of the duplex, passed the deck where it is attached to the exterior wall, essentially wrapping our entire half. There are no openings in this netting. The only way to get through it is to go under it or go off the side of the porch into the driveway, where they had their trailer parked and were actively throwing down shingles, *mostly* landing in the trailer. So, I had to walk over to the edge of the porch, poke my head out while dodging shingles, and try to get someone's attention to let them know I was coming through so that they didn't throw things down on me. 

Judging by how long they were working on the rooves of other duplexes in the neighborhood, they'll probably be at it for 2 or 3 days. They'll also probably be out there until 7 or 8 PM. That means that we effectively won't be able to use the driveway unless we feel like moving a car into it after they leave and moving it back out either a few hours later or in the morning, which I don't feel like doing.

Honestly, I don't really care about not being able to use the driveway, the noise, or how long they'll be out there. Go ahead and fix the roof on the landlord's dime, that's fine by me. It was just the cascade of little inconveniences and annoyances--not being told about the roof repair, materials showing up in the driveway without warning, them showing up and starting work earlier than expected, having to move the car first thing in the morning and then having to dodge falling shingles first thing in the morning--that summed up to being mildly infuriating.",5,1752583706.0,mildlyinfuriating,0,0.78,False

You stop thinking in hours and start thinking in exits. Your sleep schedule gives up the fight. Your body adjusts to cold coffee and gas station food and headlights in the mirror that never quite pass.

And somewhere along the way, you hear things.

Things that don’t make sense.
Things that make you laugh—until they happen to you.

I’m not writing this to scare anybody. I’m writing this because I don’t sleep right anymore, and I’m starting to hear things when the truck’s off.

If you’re ever headed east on I-44 through Missouri, between midnight and 3 a.m., and you see the sign for Ash Creek Rest Stop—

Don’t stop.

Even if your truck’s acting up.
Even if your bladder’s about to burst.
Even if you hear someone you know calling your name.

Especially then.


October last year. I remember the date, because it was two days before Halloween and I’d just passed a mile-long stretch of pumpkin farms and haunted hayride signs.

I was hauling a refrigerated load of poultry from Amarillo to Indianapolis. It was supposed to be a straight shot—twelve hours, give or take. I’d driven the route a dozen times. Could’ve done it half-asleep.

Turns out I did.

I was already past my hours, but I figured I’d stretch it thirty more minutes and hit the Pilot near Sullivan. I always stop there—well-lit, cameras, clean bathrooms, and always some other rigs nearby.

I told myself I’d nap four hours and roll out.

But the road had other plans.


Right around 1:15 a.m., the cab shuddered.

Not a bump. Not wind.

A full-body jerk, like something punched the undercarriage.

Dash lit up red:
“AIR BRAKE FAILURE – PULL OVER NOW”

Before I could react, the brakes grabbed like a fist. The wheel stiffened. I fought it onto the shoulder, heart beating so hard I could feel it in my ears.

Hazards on. Engine off. Deep breath.

I opened the door, stepped into the night—

—and that’s when I realized just how quiet it was.

No bugs. No wind. No distant traffic.

It was like standing in the middle of a paused movie.

Even the trees felt like they were holding their breath.



I circled the truck. Rear tire looked wrong. Not flat—cut.

Long, clean slice across the tread. Way too neat for a blowout. And the rubber around it was wet—but it hadn’t rained in days.

I crouched to check it and dipped two fingers into the fluid. It was black. Thick. Sticky like syrup. Smelled like… like iron and wet dirt.

I wiped it on a shop towel and stood up fast. My hands were shaking.

Then I noticed the fog. Rolling in low. Fast.

Like it knew I was here.

I reached for my phone.

No bars.

Radio? Dead.

Of course.

And then I saw it.

A sign, about thirty yards up the road.

“REST STOP 
ASH CREEK RD. 
0.5 MI”

My stomach turned.


That name—Ash Creek—it rang a bell.

Because two years before, my cousin Emory disappeared there.

His truck was found parked in the lot. Lights off. Door shut. Wallet and phone still in the cab. No blood. No note. No signs of foul play.

He was just… gone.

And the only thing the state trooper told me was:

“You don’t go looking for him out there. That place takes what you love and gives back something worse.”

I thought he was crazy.

Until I saw the same rest stop sign Emory must’ve seen.


I should’ve waited for roadside.

But the truck was leaning hard on that tire, fog was thickening, and something was scraping in the ditch behind me.

Slow. Wet. Not an animal. Too deliberate.

I got back in the cab, turned the key—

And the rig purred like nothing had ever gone wrong.

That scared me more than anything.


I drove the half-mile with my fingers tight around the wheel. Fog ate the beams alive.

When the rest stop appeared, it didn’t feel like a place. It felt like a trap.

One building. No other cars. Not a single sound.

I parked. Killed the engine. Stepped out.

And immediately gagged.

The air smelled like dirt and meat. Like someone had buried a butcher shop under a swamp.


I walked toward the building, thinking maybe I’d find a vending machine or get some bars on my phone.

I rounded the corner and froze.

There was a man standing in the doorway of the men’s restroom.

Tall. Still.

Not moving. Not blinking.

He wore something that looked like a trooper uniform, but darker. More faded. Almost like the color had been drained out of it.

I shined my flashlight.

He didn’t flinch.

Then I raised the beam to his face—

And my brain just refused to process it.

There was no face.

Just a blank, smooth surface. Like skin had been stretched over a head-shaped balloon.

No eyes. No mouth.

But still… smiling.


I backed up. Flashlight dropped. Hands shaking.

When I looked again, he was gone.


I sprinted back to my truck, climbed in, locked the doors, turned on every light I had.

I was breathing like I’d run five miles.

And then… the CB turned on.

All by itself.

No mic key pressed. No hand on the switch.

Just a low click, and a voice I haven’t heard in years:

“Cuz… hey. It’s Em. I need your help, man. I’m stuck.”

My mouth went dry.

“Come on, man. It’s real bad down here. Cold as hell. You gotta come open the door.”

I pulled the radio cord out of the socket.

But the voice kept coming.

From inside the cab.

Like it was whispering just behind my ear.

“Just open it. I’m right here.”


Then came the tapping.

Tap.
Tap-tap.
Tap.

Right under the driver’s side door.

I looked out the mirror.

And there he was.

Emory.

Face pale. Eyes too wide. Smile too sharp.

His lips moved, but the voice was still in my ear.

“Cuz. I don’t wanna be alone anymore.”


I climbed into the sleeper and curled up in the dark.

I don’t know how long I lay there. Could’ve been ten minutes. Could’ve been an hour.

But at some point, I felt the frame shift.

Like something had climbed underneath the truck.

And then came the scraping.

Long, slow drags of something hard against the undercarriage.

Followed by whispering.

Dozens of voices. All wet. All wrong.

Like they were speaking underwater.


I snapped.

Kicked the door open. Crowbar in hand.

Ready to kill or be killed.

But the lot was empty.

Except—

Behind the building, where the fog was thickest, there was a door.

Not part of the rest stop.

A steel hatch, half-buried in the gravel.

With a keypad.

And a faded label across the top:

PROJECT ASH-13 — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

The light on the keypad turned green.

And the door clicked open.


From the darkness below, I heard him again.

“Please. It’s real this time. I swear. I’m here.”

I should’ve run.

But I stepped forward. One foot on the first rung of the ladder.

I looked down.

And the walls… breathed.

Like something alive was waiting under the concrete.


I don’t remember climbing down.
But I remember the hallway.

Long. Fluorescent lights flickering. Doors on both sides, some hanging open. Walls covered in symbols I’ve never seen before.

At the end of the hall, a room.

Inside–
A single chair.
A mirror.
And headphones on a hook.

I looked into the mirror.

And saw Emory.

But not the version I knew.

This one was missing his mouth.

He was pointing behind me.

I turned.

The door was gone.


I woke up in the truck.

No idea how.

The engine was running. Lights were on. Fog gone.

Everything looked normal.

Except…

There were handprints on the inside of the windshield.


I drove until sunrise. Didn’t stop. Didn’t eat. Didn’t sleep.

Dropped the load. Told dispatch I needed time off.

That was six months ago.

And sometimes, when I’m alone, I still hear it.

Tap. Tap-tap. Tap.

And a voice from the sleeper:

“Cuz… let me in. I remembered your name this time.”


If you ever find yourself on I-44 late at night… and the fog rolls in thick… and your brakes start acting up…

Don’t stop at Ash Creek.

Don’t listen to the voices.
Don’t look in the mirror.
And whatever you do

Don’t answer the tapping.

# How to Set a Place Setting: The 2025 Ultimate Guide

Setting a table might seem like a trivial task, relegated to formal dinners and stuffy etiquette guides. However,mastering the art of the place setting is more than just arranging silverware; it's about creating an atmosphere of hospitality,showing respect for your guests,and elevating the entire dining experiance. In this guide, we'll delve into the nuances of setting a table, from the most basic casual setting to the heights of formal dining, incorporating modern variations and practical tips to ensure your table is perfectly presented for any occasion in 2025.

**Understanding the Importance of a Well-Set Table**

A well-set table communicates care and attention to detail. It signals that you value your guests and have put thought into their comfort and enjoyment. Beyond mere aesthetics, proper placement of utensils and dishes allows for smooth and intuitive dining. Guests can easily navigate the different courses without confusion, enhancing their overall experience. A thoughtfully arranged table sets the stage for engaging conversation and shared connection. It fosters a sense of occasion, transforming an ordinary meal into a memorable event.

**The Basic or Casual Place Setting: Everyday Elegance**

The basic place setting is perfect for everyday meals, casual lunches, and informal gatherings. It's simple,functional,and easy to replicate. Mastering this setting is the foundation for more elaborate arrangements.

The Plate comes first. It is placed in the center of the setting. This is your dinner plate or charger, depending on formality.

To The left of the plate, place the fork. this is traditionally the dinner fork.The Knife goes on the right side of the plate,with the blade facing towards the plate.

The Spoon goes on the right side of the knife. this is usually a soup spoon, if soup is being served. If not, a dessert spoon.

The Water glass is positioned above the knife.

A Napkin is generally located to the left of the fork, or on the plate itself.

**The Informal place Setting: Raising the Bar**

The informal place setting builds upon the basic setting, adding elements that suggest a slightly more complex meal. It's appropriate for weekend dinners, holiday gatherings with family, and less formal dinner parties.

The Charger or Dinner Plate sits in the center. A charger adds elegance,but a dinner plate is perfectly acceptable.The Salad Plate is placed on top of the dinner plate or charger. If a separate pre-dinner salad is served, this allows guests to easily remove it after the course.

Forks are arranged to the left of the plate. The dinner fork is placed closest to the plate,with the salad fork to its left. Use forks from the outside in, as courses are served.

Knives are arranged to the right of the plate.The dinner knife closest to the plate with the blade facing the plate.If an appetizer knife or butter knife is required place to the immediate right of the dinner knife.

Spoons go to the right of the knife. A soup spoon is placed furthest to the right. A teaspoon, used with coffee or dessert, can be placed next to the soup spoon if space allows, otherwise bring it out with dessert.

Bread Plate is located above the forks, towards the left. It shoudl be small and used to hold bread, rolls or crackers, and is served with a butter knife.

Glasses are placed above the knives, towards the right. The water glass is closest to the diner. To the right and slightly above, place a wine glass for white wine, and to its right and slightly above, the red wine glass.

the napkin can be placed to the left of the forks, under the forks, or decoratively on top of the plate.**the Formal Place Setting: The Pinnacle of Presentation**

The formal place setting is reserved for special occasions, elegant dinner parties, and celebratory events. It demands meticulous attention to detail and showcases the highest level of etiquette.

The Charger Plate is the foundation. It remains on the table throughout the meal until the dessert course.

Soup Bowl (if applicable) is placed on top of the charger. It is removed after the soup course is finished.

Salad Plate is placed on top of the soup bowl (if soup is served as the first course), or directly on the charger if there is no soup course.

Dinner Plate if salad is served as a separate course,the dinner plate arrives when the salad plate is cleared.

Butter Plate is positioned above the forks and to the left.It is accompanied by a butter spreader.

Forks are numerous and arranged according to the courses. Beginning from the outside in: salad fork, fish fork (if serving fish), dinner fork.

Knives follow the same principle. closest to the plate: dinner knife, fish knife (if serving fish). The blade always faces the plate.A butter knife rests on the butter plate.

Spoons are placed to the right of the knives. The soup spoon is placed furthest to the right. dessert spoon and fork are often brought out with dessert, but they can be placed above the plate horizontally, the spoon above the fork.

Glasses are numerous and carefully arranged. A water goblet is directly above the knives. Wine glasses are placed to its right and slightly above, for white wine, red wine, and champagne, positioned in that order.The Napkin is folded elaborately and sits to the left of the forks, or on the charger plate.

Place Cards are usually positioned above the plate, but can be held using decorative stands.

**Modern Variations and Creative Touches**

While customary guidelines provide a solid foundation, there's room for creativity and personalization in setting a table. In 2025, expect to see more emphasis on sustainability, minimalist design, and personalized touches.

Enduring Materials: Incorporating eco-kind materials like bamboo plates, linen napkins, and recycled glass is increasingly popular.

Minimalist Aesthetics: Stripping down the place setting to its essentials creates a clean and modern look. Focus on high-quality pieces and thoughtful arrangement.

Personalized Elements: Adding a handwritten place card, a small floral arrangement, or a unique favor for each guest elevates the dining experience and shows you care.

Themed Settings: Tailoring the place setting to the theme of the event adds a touch of whimsy and excitement.Consider using specific colors, patterns, or decorative elements that reflect the theme.

Mix-and-Match Styles: Combining different styles of silverware, plates, and glassware can create a visually interesting and personalized table setting.

**Essential Tips for a Perfect Place setting**

Pay attention to Spacing: Ensure enough space between each place setting so guests don't feel cramped. Aim for at least 24 inches between the centers of each setting.

Align Utensils: Keep the bases of the utensils aligned with the bottom rim of the plate. This creates a neat and uniform appearance.

Polish Silverware and Glassware: Spotless silverware and glassware are essential for a polished look.Use a microfiber cloth to remove any smudges or water spots.Iron Linens: Wrinkled linens detract from the overall presentation. Iron your tablecloth and napkins for a crisp and elegant look.

Consider the Menu: The courses you're serving will dictate the utensils and glassware needed. Plan your place setting accordingly.

Practice Makes perfect: Setting a table may seem daunting at first. Practice regularly to become cozy with the different arrangements.

**Common Mistakes to Avoid**

Overcrowding the table: Too many utensils and glasses can overwhelm guests. Only include what is necessary for the courses being served.

Misplacing Utensils: Ensure all utensils are placed in the correct order, according to proper etiquette.

Neglecting the Napkin: The napkin is an essential element of the place setting. Don't forget to include it and fold it neatly.

Using Damaged or Mismatched Items: Damaged plates, chipped glassware, or mismatched silverware detract from the overall presentation.

Ignoring the Overall Aesthetic: The place setting should complement the room's décor and the overall theme of the event.

**Beyond the Basics: Understanding Cultural Variations**

While these guidelines are primarily based on Western etiquette, it's important to be aware of cultural variations. In some cultures, chopsticks are used instead of forks and knives. In others, it's customary to place the napkin on the chair when leaving the table temporarily. Researching the customs of your guests' culture can definitely help you create a more welcoming and respectful dining experience.

Thus, mastering the art of setting a place setting transcends mere formality. It's about showing hospitality,creating an inviting atmosphere,and enhancing the overall dining experience. By understanding the principles of each setting, incorporating modern variations, and avoiding common mistakes, you can confidently create a table that impresses your guests and elevates any occasion in 2025.

Ultimately, remembering the foundational elements presented hear, and adapting them for any level of formality will ensure your perfect, respectful, and well-thought-out place setting.

Grits bowl and iced coffee -Spoke and Bird- 7/10 (grits slightly underdone but delicious. Banging coffee)

Fish and chips -The Dearborn- 6/10 (batter had too much leavening, slaw was kind of sad)

Egg and cheese on bagel -hotel- 4/10 (not worth the price)

Sausage and Rapini sandwich -Il Culaccino- 7.5/10 (sloppy banging sandwich was everything I needed in the moment)

Half rack with beans -Twin Anchors- 8.5/10 (fantastic old school eating. Only lost points on presentation/rib style preference)

Hot brownie Sunday -Franklin Tap- 3/10 (good beers, good service, but the dessert was really an over microwaved thing out the fridge. Did satisfy a stout and chocolate craving though)

I think it’s been 2 years since we’ve been to their house although they’ve been to ours a few times (but not a lot). The wife and I have also had each other over just 1:1 for coffee. I’m getting the feeling at this point that she would rather just have a friendship directly with me vs the whole family (maybe bc my kids are older and less interested in the younger kids). 

All that to say: I keep wanting to invite them over but I have to remind myself that if they wanted to spend time together (the 2 families) we are literally on the same street and they would have had us over by now.

1m0gqag,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodDoctorsinPune/comments/1m0gqag/vision_blur_was_just_the_beginning_what_doctors/,Vision blur was just the beginning — what doctors found shocked him.,"**Amit (41) had been feeling off for months — headaches, fatigue, constant thirst.**  
But like most people juggling work and family, he brushed it off. “Probably just burnout,” he told himself. He skipped breakfast, drank more coffee, and popped painkillers to get through meetings. Then came the scary part — blurred vision while driving on the expressway. That’s when his wife insisted he see a doctor.

He ended up at [Dr. Satish Gupta](https://g.co/kgs/oN1pPAG), considered one of the best General Physicians in Pune and a top Diabetologist in Pune at AIMS Hospital.  
Dr. Gupta didn’t just run routine tests — he patiently asked about lifestyle, diet, sleep, even family history. The results painted a clear picture: **Type 2 Diabetes**, with dangerously high blood sugar levels that had gone unnoticed for months.

Instead of scaring him with numbers, Dr. Gupta created a step-by-step plan — small diet tweaks, basic exercise, and low-dose medication. More importantly, he helped Amit understand *why* it happened and *how* to reverse the damage. In three months, his sugar was back under control, the brain fog cleared, and those panic symptoms? Gone.

**Why this story should be shared**  
Because diabetes doesn’t always scream for attention. For many, it creeps in silently, disguised as stress or exhaustion. What changed Amit’s life wasn’t just medicine — it was meeting a doctor who looked deeper, listened longer, and acted early.

If you’ve been putting off a checkup or chalking up symptoms to “just stress,” maybe it’s time you didn’t.",2,1752583271.0,GoodDoctorsinPune,1,1.0,False

1m0gole,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1m0gole/globus_for_over_2_months/,Globus for over 2 months,"Hello! I am here to share my experience and ask for some advices.

 I feel it on the left side, like a small piece of food, a popcorn shell maybe, stuck to the left side of my throat, not very deep, but somewhere in the area where the jaw connects with the throat. Sometimes I also feel it on the left side of the roof of my mouth. Rarely, it shifts and I feel it only on the right side. It never completely goes away, no matter what I do. I also have phlegm in my throat and I constantly swallow to try to make the sensation disappear. I feel this globus from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep...

Sometimes when I swallow, it feels like that piece has finally gone away, I can actually feel it going down, but then it comes back immediately. I don’t have any pain, I’m not hoarse, and I can swallow anything without problems. The only relief I get is when I chew gum, but even that doesn’t always help completely. It also feels a bit better when I eat (while I’m eating), and sometimes at night before I go to sleep it feels more ""okay"".

I've been dealing with this since the beginning of May 2025, when my dog died, went to 3 ENTs, told me they arent seeing anything, did blood and thyroid tests, they all came back good. For over 2 weeks I took omez every morning, ate only light and diet food, no sweets, no snacks, no spice, never smoked anyways, did not drink much so I stopped any bit of it, wasnt the type to drink coffee or sodas, i am very thin so my weight is not a problem here ( at the beginning of june I had a meltdown because of stress - because of my final exams and the death of my dog - and I ended up not being able to eat or drink anything and went to the ER with severe tremours because of dehydratation, starvation and lack of vitamines), during those days of being sick the sensation was gone, but right after I started feeling better it came back, although I was still taking omez and eating diet food.

Soon after I started having air hunger ( around the end of june), my therapist ( I just started therapy this month) prescribed me ignatia amara 200 CH and gelsemium 200 CH for this and for anxiety. During those few days of air hunger I...again...had no globus, after that was gone, the globus came back. Now I have been having it for 2 weeks..again, with mild air hunger. I dont even know if its gerd or anxiety, ( I do have somatic and anticpatory anxiety), but this sensation is making me go insane, i am always so depressed and crying, on edge, afraid of eating anything,  I miss my old self, and I dont know what to do to fix this. I am sleeping with my head elevated, started taking omez again since yesterday and desloratadine, today I started taking gaviscon and for 2 weeks I have been taking sedatif pc, and will soon start eating very strictly again ( dont think I ate junk food, but ate a bit more normally, allowed myself to try some sweets and snacks, onion, tomatoes stuff like that, but I did this after the globus came back once again). I dont know how to treat this anymore. I am even scared of eating anything which triggers more anxiety and nausea.


I am also leaving the country in 3 weeks for university, and my financial situation is not that good atm, so basically I am not able to schedule any appointment for endoscopy or at an psychiatrist.

It also made my GERD get even worse, so I also felt extremely nauseous a lot of the night, combined with some pregnancy nausea. There was little sleep to be had, that’s for sure.

1m0gob4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m0gob4/aio_for_thinking_this_man_emotionally_cheated_on/,AIO for thinking this man emotionally cheated on his pregnant gf?,"Months ago, I met a man I really clicked with at a work event we had both traveled to. We had unusually beautiful and deep conversations twice over coffee, during which I also opened up to him about my personal situation (soon to be divorced). I did not ask him about his personal circumstances or whether he had someone in his life and he didn’t volunteer anything either. We just parted ways admitting that we were so happy to have met each other and that we should absolutely not lose touch in the future. 

Two weeks later, he sent me a message reminiscing on some past childhood memories from our home country (we both left our country years ago because of the war). I reciprocated with an equally sentimental message, kicking off a 6-months long back and forth letter-writing relationship during which we almost became each other’s diaries. 

The letters (which we would send every three or four days) were emotional, personal, and philosophically/ psychologically dense, but never sexual or romantic. It felt more like we had built a space we both needed to help each other with what we were going through in life. 
However, he often mentioned how much he “admired me”, how “lucky” he felt to have met someone like me, how “dark” his life was before I entered it, and how “essential” I had become to him. He said he could not explain our “bond” but that our “writing” space and my presence in his life was so “vital” to him and his well being. 

Naturally, me being a hardcore sapiophile (and a giver/ fixer), I ended up developing feelings for him, although I never thought of asking if he had someone in his life. I did not ask because I was almost embarrassed, because I felt that his answer would certainly be “how can I have a gf/ wife and still write to you the way I do?” I also felt that if he had someone in his life, he would have put a stop to my writing, which was starting to show a bit more “emotion” and sentimentality over time. So I never asked him. And he never said anything.

Fast forward a few months, as he was telling me again how much he admired me and how rare it was for him to be this impressed by someone for this long, I finally asked him. It wasn’t a straightforward question, but it was enough for him to get the message: I needed to know. 

His answer left me speechless for days. It turned out, not only did he have someone he “was in love with” in his life. She was also pregnant. He then went on to say that he had told her about me right after meeting me and that she knew about my importance in his life. He said that he would not change a single word or feeling in our correspondence, even if she is to one day read our letters. However, he did admit that he did not show her our conversations because the intimacy in them was as much mine as it was his, and that would “not be right”.

After I recovered from the initial shock, I wrote back telling him that it was very unfair to keep his gf a secret from the beginning and that even though I never “asked”, he could have at least mentioned her or their future child in his letters at some point. He told me SO many things about his life, his parents, friends, and coworkers… so how could he have possibly eclipsed the most important person in his life? 

I ended my note admitting that I had grown feelings for him along the way and that he had hurt me deeply.  He apologized profusely, saying that hurting me was never the intention, that he really only wanted us all (including his gf) to be friends (almost like family) one day, and that he needs me to stay in his life because he has never experienced a bond like ours before and it would be a shame to throw such a beautiful relationship away because of some social norms and “should be’s”. 

He is even suggesting now introducing me to her. 

I really do not know what to think of all this and of his reaction (which is making me feel like I am the crazy one here). I don’t know if he was engaging in a light emotional affair, which he then denied because I told him off, or if he really genuinely only wanted to have a platonic relationship from the beginning. He’s a very smart person but I suspect he is also a bit neurodivergent (and is a bit of an “artistic/ philosopher” type) so I am not sure if that is why we both drew two completely different (though both equally intense) impressions from the very same experience. 

I really want to be mad at him and walk away but another part of me is wondering if I am overreacting, and if I just allowed myself to fall for something that I imagined, that never really existed. But then again,  I put myself in his gf’s shoes and think that I would be very upset in her place… that what he did was hurtful, even if she knew a bit about my existence and importance in his life.

I got a lame ass sandwich, dry and too greasy for my fragile stomach ; i can't handle eating it right now... I'm munched on a dried fruit bar and now on a little chocolate snack but I don't really feel like eating since my stomach is kind of in knots because of anxiety. I'll try eating my snack on the course of the second train so I have something in my stomach !

Hi everyone, has anyone visited or stayed at Jumeirah Bay resort - what did you think about it?

I'm visiting Muscat in December and I'll be staying at the Mysk al Mouj for the majority of my visit, then going to a more luxurious resort for my last few days.

Last year I stayed at the Chedi and it was wonderful. The facilities, breakfast and the service were faultless and I also loved meeting and chatting to some of the locals who would come for coffee in the evening. 

I just wonder how it compares to Jumeirah and whether it's worth trying somewhere different this time - to be honest I just found it by accident while searching for hotels. Or do I skip both and try Al Bustan?

I’m researching a concept for a pooled buying group for independent coffee shops in the UK — starting with things like coffee beans, alternative milks, takeaway cups, and other repeat-use supplies.

The idea is simple:  
Instead of ordering alone (and paying £17–£22/kg for beans), 10–15 shops in the same area would order together — and unlock better supplier pricing (think £13–£15/kg), kind of like a mini buying syndicate.

We’d handle the coordination, supplier negotiation, payments, and deliveries — so it’s still simple for you.

Right now I’m just collecting feedback — and trying to understand:

* Is this a real pain point for you?
* Would you be open to something like this if it was easy to use?
* What would make or break it for you?

This is not about reducing quality and impacting how you service your valued customers. 

Its about delivering technology to the high street independent stores, to compete with the chains on pricing from suppliers. 

  
any feedback would be very welcome

Download the Costa Coffee app and enter a referral code to get a **free** sweat treat of your choice. You **need to opt into receive marketing comms** to get the free cake voucher emailed to you.

New customers will **also receive 5 free “beans”** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

———————————-

Steps:

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://swf3j.app.goo.gl/C9HgF)).
* **Register** and enter the referral code **K9GUN**
* Remember to opt into comms to receive the free cake email on your birthday!
* To receive the “free” 5 beans first **make a purchase at Costa and scan the app when paying**.
* The 5 free beans will be **credited to your account within 48 hours** (it was immediately for me).

Pro tip, if it’s anything like Caffè Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Enjoy the free cake I recommend the Mini Cherry Bakewell!

And sometimes, these guys are playing hard to get. And it's kind of like, this is what's making me jump through hoops? I was talking to this guy over the weekend. Great body. His bio seems like he's a fun guy. But his messages are all really short. At first, I thought he wasn't interested, but I notice he responds pretty quickly. And he seems to be engaged in the conversation, just giving 1 worded responses. He's liking my messages too. Which is also kinda odd. But it did kinda feel like I was carrying the conversation. Asking how his day was, etc. But I offered to trade pics and he said sure. He liked my pics, but he sends his pics over. And, his face was not what I thought it would be. He just looked, rough. 

  
And for a moment I was like ""this is who is playing hard to get?"" And I'll be honest, my attraction to him did fade. I was trying to meet him for a coffee date too before this. It kinda seemed like pulling teeth, but he would still respond. But now? Seeing the face combined with me carrying the conversation? No sir. I want to give him a chance though. Like, we would be compatible sexually, he's actually single, he's in shape, we're near the same age. Maybe he's just not a good conversationalist? His profile does say ""DL"" so maybe that's a huge part of it. 

  
I've also experienced this myself. Guys have told me my face doesn't match up with my body. I have a ""jocks body"" but they say I have a babyface. Alot of people mistake me for looking 21 even though I'm turning 27 soon. Or that I'm ""handsome"" or ""gorgeous"" or ""model type pretty"". I do model and am signed with an agency so I guess it makes sense. I showed a guy my face pic and he said I was ""too pretty to be a top"". I've also had guys tell me I look too young for them.

In order to get into the first lane going into the second smaller roundabout. However he then moves back into the right lane to take the third exit on the roundabout.

1m0gbyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1m0gbyx/i_sent_him_back_his_selfies/,I sent him back his selfies,"I literally almost never get attracted to anyone. It's super hard for me to find a person attractive. Physical beauty on its own is not enough for me and it happens to me maybe once every 2 years or less, to see and like a man and have any attraction to him. No matter how handsome/beautiful those men are.

So here I am, back on facebook, after many months of not using it at all, I went in to post a little reel, that had some nice moments and myself in them.. And this guy, that I completely forgot about, the one that is clearly divinely created, cause can I just say PERFECTION .. He reacts with 5 hearts on my story. He's literally gorgeous, like a 100/10. Face, body, but the eyes... I've always loved to look into his beautiful deep eyes....  
And he's not just handsome, but quite intelligent and loves the same type of music and is bold and masculine, and loves God and has all of these bombastic fantastic traits, that combined, just make him extremely attractive to me. And super rare. For me. And I'm pretty sure for other women too, but that's not my business.  
We've chatted before, here and there, he's liked my pictures and videos before, but never overtly tried to flirt with me. Maybe slightly covertly, like 2y ago, but that's it. So after his 5 hearts, I decided to shoot him a message, to see how he's doing, where he's at, in life, you know. We've done that before so I didn't see why not. Thought it'd be a 3 line exchange and I'll go back to forgetting how handsome he is.

But this time was different, right from the get go he calls me a doll and beautiful and starts flirting with me, I'm obviously excited about it, and we have an amazing chemistry in conversation too, the humour the intelligent flirting, the lack of need to explain, cause he gets me, without even trying ah!  
It was GREAT until his flirting jokes started getting a little too .. close to sexual, and I tried to put a boundary, soft at first, then very very clear, and we kept going from flirting to benign topics, yet somehow we always came back to sexy jokes. Until I left the conversation to go grab a link of something funny to share with him, and when I came back, I came back to a selfie he sent me.. of him, shirtless, half sitting, half laying in bed. With a serious expression too! I was like ""SIR, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" LOL  
It was just a selfie of his face, shoulders and up, but you know, the vibe, is too soon, too sexy, too much.

So I expressed that, and told him I'm glad at least his photo was cropped. Next thing I know I have a picture of him shirtless with his full six pack smiling at me doing that biceps pose with his arm, that male models do LOL . It was shocking, but also perfect looking but also very tempting in nature, but also WHY. Like he's exactly 1000% what I LIKE. But not in our first real long conversation!!!  
It was so hard to put that boundary, especially with his soft voice, it felt like a pro seducer move from his side haha but that was way too much too early, too ...tooo tooo!  
At this point I told him I'm going to sleep and thanks for the funny and flirty conversation and sent him a funny link to checkout and we finished the 2h talk.  
For the record I didn't overstep my boundaries and nothing sexual was spoken of. I just enjoyed the beauty and his sexy voice. The rest was jokes and flirting.

I didn't expect this from someone who .. all he does is speak about God, in his life, he is sort of a public (small) figure, and all he speaks about is spirit, Jesus, God, bible etc... given the fact that one night stands type of behavior is not exactly Jesus friendly, but I'm not judging. I had fun flirting with him, but I stood my ground and didn't step on any of my boundaries. Also I'm not a 1 night stand type of a woman, so I wouldn't entertain that either way. A little flirting though, was pretty exciting, with him.

The next day came and honestly I didn't even know if I'll ever hear from him again, but I did.  
He did message me some things back and forth and this time no excessive flirting, he only said that if we were close, we'd be meeting face to face for coffee, and not just have these conversations on the phone  
( coffee??!?!? that's not a date) and then enjoyed some deep spiritual topics, and I was happy about that.  
Then out of nowhere, mid voice-messages conversation, he disappeared. Stopped responding. I haven't said anything stupid, we were literally exchanging deep topics and some knowledge, then BAM... At first he didn't even open the voice messages I'd sent in response to his. The next day he'd opened them and left me on seen.  
The only thing that I can think of that I might have said is offering some knowledge about a third language that I know (and he doesn't) to talk about the symbolism of a word that he expressed wrongly, but being told more about what you know or even being corrected in something you said wrong by a native speaker, is NOT a reason to ghost someone... At least not in my book. Maybe in his ego - book though. It's not like I was rude about it or even tried to correct him, just expressed what I know, in addition to what he said. So I genuinely don't think I've said anything wrong.

He's online. ALL THE TIME. He's seen my reply and has left me on seen for days now.  
I know that once we (ladies) hit the 24h it's over, so even though I decided to walk away.. I had this crazy urge, that probably no one will understand, but I had to do it for myself.  
To send him back his selfies before I walk away.  
His shirtless, perfect looking sexy selfies, that I didn't ask for.  
Send them back.  
Petty? Maybe. But not to me.  
Return them, like an unwanted, yet perfect gift,  
return that which does not belong to me, to its rightful owner. Not for attention. Not for a reply. Not for a question to answer. Just to set the record straight, for my future.  
Like an ethereal, maybe, energetic return, that was brought into my mind, my memory and has tempted me, to send it back, and disown it.  
To place it back, where it belongs.

I've never returned gifts before in my adult life.

It's not like he sent them for the right reasons anyway.  
He obviously just sees me as a piece of meat, with no feelings and opinions that matter to him. Clearly just wanted to cross my boundaries (yes in a sexy way, but) for his own sexual gratification, without even seeing me as a human being. And that made me feel disrespected.

So I did it. And I feel relieved!  
And I don't give a shit what he's gonna think of me anyway. Clearly he has no empathy for me, so it doesn't matter how ""crazy"" of a woman he thinks I am.

After I did it, I went back on tiktok, to unfollow him, and what do I see...  
He's shot this one video (martial arts), completely out of the ordinary (spiritual talks), just now, while ignoring me, when... we were talking about martial arts the other day, and I complemented his speed and technique and I said how much I miss kickboxing. He's not posted martial arts on his tiktok like ever or maybe at least in years. Feels like he's begging for attention and validation, while ignoring me at the same time...?  
How pathetic!  
He's even wearing one of those free the nips male ""tops"" when the other night after he sent me that freed nips photo we joked about it. He never dresses like this on this videos. It doesn't even look like a top, it just looks like a piece of fabric flying around unattended lol  
This is just... so strange!

I'm pretty sure we'll never talk again, and he'll never know why I did what I did.  
And it's fine..ish.",1,1752582103.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.67,False

# The Enduring Popularity of RSI and MACD in 2025

It’s 2025, and I’m still using RSI and MACD like it’s 2013. Sometimes I wonder if that makes me outdated-like the guy still clinging to wired headphones while everyone else has Neuralink-powered scalp music. But every time I try switching to newer, shinier indicators, I end up right back here. Just me, my charts, and two little tools that somehow still feel like home.

The truth is, RSI and MACD have a staying power most indicators can’t touch. Even now, in a world flooded with predictive models, AI-generated sentiment signals, and enough algorithmic strategies to crash your CPU, these two tools remain the go-to combo for thousands of traders-whether they’re scalping crypto or swing trading ETFs on their lunch break.

It’s easy to look at RSI and MACD and think, “There’s no way these dinosaurs still work.” But when you step back and actually use them-not blindly, but as part of a disciplined setup-they still deliver. Not perfectly. Not magically. But consistently enough to make you stop and ask: what if it’s not about keeping up with the newest thing, but about sticking with what actually keeps you sane?

**Why Are RSI and MACD Still Relevant in 2025?**

The thing about RSI and MACD is they’re not trying to be anything they’re not. They’re not promising to predict the next breakout before it happens. They’re not whispering secret signals pulled from sentiment analysis or data scraping. They’re just showing you the mood of the market in real time-and asking you to respond, not react.

RSI, the Relative Strength Index, is still a favorite because it does one job well. It tells you when something might be overbought or oversold. It doesn’t give you drama. Just vibes backed by math.

MACD, or Moving Average Convergence Divergence, leans a bit deeper. It doesn’t scream for attention, but when a crossover happens or divergence pops up, it’s like a quiet nudge saying, “Hey, the momentum is shifting. You seeing this?”

What makes them relevant even now isn’t just nostalgia. It’s accessibility. Anyone with a TradingView account or a half-decent brokerage platform can use them. You don’t need to be a quant or code in Python to make them work. That matters in a world where overcomplication has become the default.

**Are RSI and MACD Still Effective for Traders in Modern Markets?**

Let’s not romanticize it. RSI and MACD won’t save you in a flash crash. They won’t call the top of a parabolic rally. And if you’re relying on them without understanding how they behave in different market conditions, you’ll get wrecked.

But if you’re using them as part of a structured approach-one that’s backtested, adjusted for your timeframe, and grounded in rules-they can be wildly effective. Not because they predict the future, but because they help you avoid stupid trades.

Effectiveness in trading isn’t about being right all the time. It’s about having a system that you can follow even when your brain is screaming to panic-buy or rage-sell. RSI and MACD give structure. They slow you down just enough to second-guess the impulsive stuff. In a market ruled by noise and FOMO, that’s a serious edge.

**The Enduring Power of RSI and MACD: A Deep Dive into Their Continued Utility in 2025**

Here’s the part nobody really talks about: even the most advanced algorithmic systems today are built on the skeletons of indicators like RSI and MACD. They might be dressed up with machine learning or run through a thousand layers of neural net wizardry, but the core logic-momentum, trend, exhaustion-it’s the same.

I spoke with a quant analyst last year who builds custom tools for institutional desks, and he straight-up told me: “Yeah, we use RSI concepts. We just layer them with volume-weighted filters and sentiment overlays.” In other words, the tools have evolved, but the foundation hasn’t disappeared.

There’s a kind of elegance in how RSI and MACD strip everything down. They let you see the rhythm of the market without distraction. And when you actually commit to them-not as one-click solutions, but as part of a broader system-they don’t just work. They teach you how to wait, how to listen, and how to act with intention.

I spent the first half of 2023 chasing complexity. I tried sentiment dashboards, AI-generated alerts, even a machine learning script someone sold me on Discord. And it worked... until it didn’t. The worst part wasn’t the losses. It was the way I felt-disconnected from my own trades. Like I was just reacting to noise I didn’t even understand.

Coming back to RSI and MACD felt like putting my feet back on the ground. The signals were familiar, but more than that, they were mine. I knew what they meant. I knew how I reacted to them. And I wasn’t second-guessing every move because I wasn’t outsourcing my judgment to some algorithm I couldn’t explain.

**Insight from “Atomic Habits” by James Clear – Chapter 16**

“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”

That line hit me like a brick. Because that’s exactly what RSI and MACD are for me. They’re not flashy. They don’t win Twitter threads. But they form a system I can fall back on when everything else gets noisy. And in a market that never shuts up, that kind of discipline might be the biggest edge we have left.

# How Trading Indicators Have Evolved Since RSI and MACD

The trading world didn’t just evolve-it sprinted into chaos. Since the days when RSI and MACD ruled the charts, we’ve seen an explosion of new tools, flashy signals, and algorithmic models that promise to “beat the market” before you’ve even had coffee. Some of them are brilliant. Some are straight-up marketing noise. But all of them exist because the market doesn’t sit still-and neither do we.

Still, not everything that’s advanced is actually better. And not everything that’s older is obsolete.

So where does that leave us?

**Are Newer Indicators Better Than RSI and MACD in 2025?**

Here’s the messy truth: a lot of newer indicators look better on paper, especially if you’re just watching backtests or YouTube breakdowns with perfect setups and zero emotion. You’ll hear terms like ""reinforcement learning,"" ""signal clustering,"" or ""high-dimensional volatility models"" and feel like you’ve been trading in the Stone Age.

But better doesn’t mean more usable. And in the real world, where your attention span is split between a job, life, and a volatile market that turns on a tweet, simpler tools often win.

The newer indicators can offer tighter signals, more reactivity, or predictive value-but they also come with more complexity, steeper learning curves, and higher chances of misuse if you’re not careful. You’re not just reading an indicator; you’re trying to trust a system you didn’t build, can’t easily explain, and maybe don’t fully understand.

In that way, RSI and MACD still win. Not because they’re newer. But because they’re clear. Because you know exactly what they’re doing-and that gives you power over how you respond.

**What Are the Most Advanced Alternatives to RSI and MACD Today?**

In 2025, the frontier of trading indicators looks like something out of a sci-fi film. You’ve got sentiment-weighted volume heatmaps, predictive neural indicators, and tools that scrape social media and news headlines in real-time to assess “market mood.” You’ve got platforms that track thousands of data points and feed them into adaptive machine learning systems that attempt to front-run patterns.

There’s also a new wave of indicators built entirely by AI, some of which recalibrate themselves daily based on evolving market inputs. These aren’t just giving buy or sell signals-they’re trying to think like the market before it acts.

For advanced traders, these tools are gold. They offer layers of nuance and multi-factor data streams that would’ve been impossible just a few years ago. But they also come at a cost-mentally, financially, and emotionally. The more complex your tools, the more energy it takes to maintain conviction when they go wrong. Because they will go wrong. Every system does.

**Why Do Many Traders Still Swear by Traditional Indicators Despite Advancements?**

Because trading is 80% mental. You can give someone the best system in the world, and if they don’t believe in it, they’ll abandon it after three losing trades. What RSI and MACD offer that most advanced tools don’t is trust. A sense of rhythm. Years of emotional memory and pattern recognition that can’t be quantified.

Most traders don’t just use indicators for signals-they use them for structure. For stability. For a way to quiet the noise when the market is screaming at them to panic.

There’s something powerful about using a tool you’ve seen work through three different market cycles. That kind of experience builds conviction. And conviction is what lets you stay in a trade when your gut is telling you to bail.

Last year, I beta-tested a smart indicator suite that pulled real-time Reddit sentiment, crypto inflows, and options flow into one predictive dashboard. It was wild-accurate, data-rich, and beautiful. But after two months, I was exhausted. I couldn’t tell if I was trading the chart or just reacting to the dashboard’s mood swings.

I went back to RSI and MACD not because they’re smarter, but because they give me space to think. To breathe. To decide. That matters more than any predictive edge you can buy.

**Insight from “The Psychology of Money” by Morgan Housel – Chapter 13**

“Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.”

Most of these newer tools promise control over the market. But what a lot of experienced traders realize is that the real win isn’t perfect entries-it’s peace of mind. RSI and MACD don’t just simplify your trading setup. They give you back time, energy, and mental bandwidth. And in the chaos of modern markets, that might be the highest ROI there is.

# The Pros and Cons of RSI and MACD in Modern Trading

No indicator is bulletproof. Not even the old reliables.

In 2025, with markets reacting to everything from AI-fed trading bots to TikTok-fueled pump cycles, the tools you choose say a lot about how you trade-and how you handle chaos. RSI and MACD have been around for decades, and while their simplicity is often praised, it’s also what gets them dragged in forums and finfluencer rants.

Some call them outdated. Others call them timeless.

The truth, as usual, is somewhere in the uncomfortable middle.

**What Are the Limitations of RSI and MACD in Volatile Markets?**

Here’s the uncomfortable part first: RSI and MACD were built in an era when markets moved slower, were less algorithm-driven, and had far fewer fakeouts.

In today’s world, price action doesn’t just reflect fundamentals or investor sentiment-it reflects algos fighting algos, front-running volume, and whales playing retail traders like a game of chess.

In that environment, RSI and MACD can lag. They can throw false signals when a spike is nothing more than short-covering. They can tell you something is oversold, right before it dumps another 10%.

If you’re not adjusting your settings or cross-checking with other indicators, they can get noisy. Worse, they can feel “wrong” just when you need clarity most.

But here’s what’s real: the tools aren’t broken. The context has changed. And in volatile markets, that means they require more discretion, not blind faith.

**Can RSI and MACD Be Used Effectively in Automated or AI-Based Trading?**

Yes-and they already are. The twist is that they’re usually part of something bigger.

Most modern algo strategies still incorporate RSI and MACD logic at their core. It’s just that they’re dressed up with layers of filtering, confirmation, and context. You’ll find them triggering trades, filtering out noise, or acting as throttles for more complex systems.

So if you’re thinking about coding your own bot or using these indicators in a rule-based strategy, the answer is: yes, they still belong. They’re programmable, explainable, and stable across most platforms. Which makes them incredibly useful for automation-especially if you’re building your system from scratch or trying to keep it transparent.

What doesn’t work? Treating them like crystal balls.

If you expect your RSI-based bot to print cash in all conditions without supervision or context, you’re not trading-you’re gambling on autopilot.

**How Do RSI and MACD Compare to Newer Machine-Learning-Based Tools?**

It’s not a fair fight, honestly.

Machine learning tools don’t just look at price and volume-they analyze everything from macroeconomic news to global fund flows to tweet sentiment from high-influence accounts. They’re designed to spot patterns humans can’t see and react faster than you can blink.

But that doesn’t make them better for everyone.

ML tools are expensive, require ongoing training and updates, and can become black boxes-you don’t always know why a signal was generated. That might be fine for a hedge fund with a team of data scientists. For the solo trader or side hustler building a strategy in between classes or after work, it’s a lot to manage.

What RSI and MACD offer is *interpretability*. You can look at a chart, see a divergence, and understand why. You don’t have to trust it blindly. You can question it, test it, and decide.

And in an age where we’re outsourcing more and more decisions to machines, that kind of transparency might be the rarest edge of all.

Back when I was experimenting with a plug-and-play AI trading system, I remember how frustrating it was not knowing *why* a trade was entered. It was like living with a roommate who moves your stuff and refuses to explain themselves.

I missed the clarity of RSI and MACD. I missed being able to say, “Okay, I see what this setup is telling me, and I know what I’ll do if it plays out-or if it doesn’t.”

That clarity made me feel like a trader again. Not a button pusher.

**Insight from “Thinking, Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman – Chapter 20**

“The more successful the defensive operations of System 2, the more it weakens the impulsive actions of System 1.”

RSI and MACD aren’t perfect. But they’re part of a thinking system. A method. And in the high-speed, emotionally loaded world of trading, that’s what saves you-not hype, not predictions, but steady tools that slow you down just enough to think.

# Understanding the Discipline Behind Using RSI and MACD in 2025

At this point, we’ve covered the tools, the tech, and the trends. But the real question-especially as a Gen Z trader staring down the endless options of new indicators and fancy automated systems-is this: why stick with RSI and MACD when everything else feels so much more… advanced?

The answer? Discipline. And it’s the kind of discipline that comes from knowing your system works-because you’ve seen it work, over and over again.

**Is Sticking to Traditional Indicators a Sign of Discipline or Stagnation?**

I get it. In a world obsessed with the latest and greatest, sticking to the classics can feel like a confession of laziness, even resistance to progress. After all, why would you use a 40-year-old tool when AI is picking stocks for people in real-time?

Here’s the truth: it’s easy to get distracted by new shiny things. But sticking to a system-whether that’s RSI, MACD, or whatever works for you-isn’t stagnation. It’s an active choice to trust what you know.

When you lean into these indicators, you’re not being stubborn. You’re being consistent. You’re relying on time-tested tools to form a foundation for your trading decisions. The world moves fast. Tech moves faster. But your ability to follow through with a clear strategy? That’s what matters in the long run.

Discipline in trading doesn’t look like complex systems or predictive models. It looks like showing up every day, trusting your setup, and executing your strategy with no emotional shortcuts. In a world that’s always changing, consistency is your anchor.

**The Psychology of Disciplined Trading: Why RSI and MACD Can Foster Consistency**

Trading is a battle against yourself as much as it is against the market. There are no shortcuts to success; no indicator can fix that for you. And while many newer tools promise faster profits or more accurate signals, the reality is they often feed into our worst impulses. They push us toward trying to outsmart the market-often just when we should be sitting back and letting the market show us what it’s doing.

RSI and MACD might not be able to predict the next massive move, but they provide structure. They take away the need to constantly make emotional decisions or react impulsively. By using these indicators, you’re forced into a rhythm-a predictable system that keeps your head cool when the market is throwing tantrums.

That’s the real value in these tools. They don’t just give you signals. They give you consistency. And in an unpredictable market, consistency is one of the few things that can help you weather the storm.

**How Does Sticking to Proven Methods Help in Navigating Market Fluctuations?**

When the market crashes, the adrenaline kicks in. When prices skyrocket, we can feel the FOMO creeping up. In those moments, it’s easy to want to change the plan, chase the trend, or gamble on a big win. But the best traders know that when the market gets wild, it’s the steady hands that win the race-not the ones reaching for the next tool.

Here’s the kicker: RSI and MACD don’t give you that rush. They don’t promise the next big trade or the most dramatic breakout. But they do give you a simple, clean setup to follow. And that’s the discipline of trading-the ability to stick to a plan, even when every other voice in your head is telling you to do something else.

Because at the end of the day, success in trading isn’t about picking the next hot stock or finding the next secret algorithm. It’s about following the plan you trust, through thick and thin. RSI and MACD are old tools, sure. But they offer something more valuable than the latest tech-they give you the power to *stay grounded*, no matter how chaotic the market gets.

There’s a quiet satisfaction that comes with sticking to a tried-and-true strategy. In early 2024, I hit a few rough patches. I was tempted to jump into every new tech-based tool that promised the moon. But after I settled back into my RSI and MACD setup, something clicked. The trades weren’t always perfect. But there was confidence in the process.

No noise. No confusion. Just a steady strategy that I knew how to navigate.

**Insight from “The Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham – Chapter 1**

“The individual investor should act with a calm and reasoned approach, relying on fundamentals, not speculation.”

If there’s a philosophy that has stood the test of time in investing and trading, it’s this one. RSI and MACD aren’t about speculation. They’re about following the fundamentals of market rhythm-taking emotion out of the equation and trading from a place of clarity.

**Final Thoughts: Is RSI and MACD the Future or the Past?**

In 2025, we’re living in a world of infinite choices-each promising to be smarter, faster, and more accurate than the last. But when the dust settles, there’s still something deeply reliable about sticking with tools that have worked for decades. RSI and MACD might not offer you some high-tech shortcut. But they give you something else: discipline. Structure. Consistency.

And in a market that’s more unpredictable than ever, that might be the most powerful tool of all.

  


# FAQ: Still Using RSI and MACD in 2025?

Sometimes the simplest tools raise the biggest questions-especially now, when trading feels faster and more complex than ever. So let’s break it down clearly: do RSI and MACD still matter? Or have they been left behind?

# Are RSI and MACD Still Relevant in 2025?

Yes - without question. Even with new tools launching every other week, RSI and MACD are still part of many traders’ daily routine. Why? Because they’re reliable. They’re simple. And most importantly, they still help people make sense of messy markets.

RSI shows you when a stock or coin might be overheated or running cold. MACD helps you catch trend shifts before they’re obvious. Neither one promises perfect timing - but both give you a clear signal when things are getting interesting. In a year where noise was everywhere, that kind of signal felt like gold.

# What Are the Alternatives to RSI and MACD in 2025?

There are plenty of new tools out there - especially ones powered by AI and real-time data scraping. Some scan news headlines, social media posts, and even global sentiment to predict market moves before they happen.

Sounds great in theory. But here’s the reality: those tools come with a steep learning curve. They’re complex, hard to trust without deep understanding, and often feel more like a black box than a roadmap.

Compared to that, RSI and MACD feel like solid ground. They don’t require coding skills or data science knowledge. You can read them with your eyes, learn them in a week, and still use them a year later with confidence. That’s why they haven’t gone anywhere.

# How Do RSI and MACD Help with Disciplined Trading?

Trading isn’t just about spotting setups - it’s about staying level-headed. That’s where RSI and MACD quietly do their best work.

When you rely on these indicators, you’re not just going off vibes or rumors. You’re following structure. RSI gives you a warning when things are stretched. MACD shows when momentum is shifting. And once you’ve built your rules around those signals, they become your compass.

That structure helps you avoid emotional trades - the panic sells, the FOMO buys. When you know what you're looking for, you stop guessing. You stay grounded.

# Can RSI and MACD Be Used in Automated Trading?

Yes, and many traders still build bots around them. Because RSI and MACD are rule-based and easy to program, they fit naturally into automated strategies.

But automation doesn’t mean autopilot. If you're running RSI or MACD in a bot, you still need to monitor performance, adjust settings, and make sure the system isn’t blindly reacting without context. The indicators work - but only if your overall setup makes sense.

# What Are the Limitations of RSI and MACD in Volatile Markets?

Like any tool, they have blind spots - especially when the market’s moving fast.

RSI, for example, can stay in the overbought zone during strong uptrends. That doesn’t always mean a reversal is coming - just that momentum’s high. Same with MACD: in choppy or sideways markets, it can throw off signals that don’t really stick.

So if volatility spikes, don’t ditch RSI and MACD - just use them with caution. Pair them with other tools, look for confluence, and consider adjusting your settings to better fit the speed of the market. They’re still useful - just not in isolation.

# Final Thoughts

RSI and MACD might feel old-school in a market obsessed with the latest tech. But they’ve lasted for a reason: they’re clear, practical, and they help traders stay consistent. And in 2025, consistency still beats complexity.",1,1752582058.0,TheFinanceTrending,0,1.0,False

""I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

I'm guessing they're using a whisk to foam the milk but even then, it would be too watered down by my standards. I like to enjoy my coffee for a long time and taste the difference at every temperature. That won't do. That's the biggest reason I hate ice in any drink side from water if course.

I am 35m, a writer living alone in an apartment that smells like cedar, old books, and way too much French press coffee. I have been single for a while, not in a dramatic way, but like a plant on a windowsill that has not been watered in too long. I survive, but I am missing something.

It is not just sex I miss. It is the little quiet moments that do not get talked about. The soft touch of a hand on your skin while cooking, a lazy laugh shared over burnt toast and tangled sheets.

Just yesterday, after a long day, I stood by the window, skin still warm from the shower, slowly applying moisturizer. I could feel the cream sliding over my arms, the scent faintly sandalwood and cedar. Then I put on a crisp linen shirt. The cool fabric brushed against my skin. In that moment, I found myself longing not just for touch but for someone who would understand exactly how that felt. That kind of closeness that does not need words.

I write stories about love and intimacy. Once, a woman told me my words made her cry alone at a gas station in Vermont. That stuck with me because part of me wants to be that for someone, not the tears, but the comfort that makes loneliness softer.

I am okay being alone. I make pancakes that could start a small cult. I talk to my cat like she is my therapist. I can name every moon phase thanks to a librarian I once dated who challenged me. I have traveled solo through Lisbon, written handwritten letters in Prague cafés, and once got hopelessly lost in Kyoto with a dead phone and only a notebook. That afternoon was one of the best I have ever had.

But lately, even my best writing cannot reach the part of me that wants to hold someone’s ankle while she reads on the couch. Or hear the key in the door and know it is her. To feel the heat of someone real. To have skin against mine without feeling like a stranger’s.

Most conversations these days feel like performances. At clubs or social gatherings it is the same small talk and schmoozing on repeat. I want more than polite smiles and rehearsed laughs. I want something messy, raw, and honest. Please DM me if you too have a silly heart like that. 

I am not broken. I am just human. And being this vulnerable means sometimes waking up in the middle of the night whispering “I miss you” into the dark even when I do not know who I am saying it to.

""I'm warning you one last time—keep your mouth shut when you leave. Whatever happened in the past three years, bury it and forget it, got it? Don't think being the daughter of duke's estate means someone's going to back you up!""

""There never was anyone before, and there sure won't be in the future."" Athena Monson's face was expressionless, her voice hollow. She nodded meekly, not daring to defy the steward.

Leaning against the wall for support, she slowly made her way out of the camp.

She had once lit up Pidence City with her dazzling dance. Now her knees, ruined from years of injury, could barely hold her weight. Without medicine, even her skill in healing was useless.

Just outside the camp, she heard someone call her name. Flinching, she lifted her head hesitantly.

What met her eyes was a majestic steed, a royal gift, and astride it sat the Marquis of Somers—Michael Osborne. The famed war god himself.

He sat tall and poised, broad shoulders tapering to a lean waist, his face strikingly handsome. He still carried that same air of noble elegance.

This was the man she had loved for three long years. She had seen this scene in her dreams countless times—him finally coming to take her home.

Her eyes filled with tears, and she opened her mouth to speak, but no words came.

Because it was him—he was the one who had thrown her into this hellish camp, ordering others to ""teach her a lesson.""

The cold indifference in his eyes made her already shattered heart tremble again.

""I can take you home,"" Michael said, looking down at her from his horse, eyes like ice, his tone as sharp as a blade. ""But tell me—do you finally admit you were wrong?

""If you hadn't poisoned the pastries back then, Willow wouldn't be living with a chronic illness. She still needs daily medicine. You only suffered three years of punishment—she'll suffer for the rest of her life. You owe her forever!""

When Athena remained silent, Michael snapped, ""Answer me! Do you admit your guilt?""

The sudden sharpness in his voice made her jump. Reflexively, she shut her eyes, wrapped her arms around her head, and crouched down, crying out, ""I admit it! I was wrong! I'll never do it again!""

But the lash she expected never came. Only then did she remember—he was the Marquis of Somers. A man like him would never lower himself to beat someone like her.

Still, she truly had been wrong. She was wrong to care. Wrong to love. Wrong to give her heart to people who treated it like nothing.

When she'd first been thrown into the camp, she still clung to a shred of hope.

She had thought, 'My fiancé can't really be that heartless. He has protected me since our engagement—risking his life, even, to spare me from harm.

'And my parents in the duke's estate—surely, they would come for me. I have been framed.'

But she waited. And waited. And what came instead was nothing but torment—merciless, day after day, at the hands of the soldiers.

She was a noblewoman, not a camp whore. They didn't dare touch her, which only made them more creative in how they broke her.

Sometimes, they beat her with slender whips made specifically for disciplining women—tools that cut deep and left her flesh in tatters. Other times, they stripped her naked and tossed her into the snow.

They were waiting for her to beg. To give in. To offer her body in exchange for a bite of food or a few days of peace.

But she never did. So their torment grew nastier, more degrading, every time.

Eventually, she stopped fighting back—not out of obedience, but because she no longer had the strength to resist.

""Athena, what game are you playing now?"" Michael frowned, his tone sharp with disdain.

He wondered, 'Three years of discipline, and she's ended up this pathetic?'

The once-glowing beauty of her face was gone—now it was sickly pale and hollow. Her waist, once soft and full, had thinned so much it looked like it might snap under a strong breeze.

He thought, 'Trying to act pitiful? I am not falling for it. I personally ordered my men to take good care of her. There is no way she's truly been mistreated.'

Turning away, Michael dismounted. He reached out a hand toward her. ""Get in the carriage.""

But she recoiled like a wounded animal, clutching her head, eyes blank, voice trembling as she pleaded, ""No… please don't… don't touch me…""

""That's enough,"" he snapped. ""Still pretending to be pitiful?""

His voice turned colder. ""What, is this your way of making me feel guilty?""

Athena slowly came back to herself. Her voice was dry, hoarse. She gave a hollow laugh, laced with self-mockery.

In front of Michael—or her parents—she had never once had the right to feel wronged.

If they'd ever truly felt guilty, they wouldn't have waited until now.

Thirteen years ago, her birth parents finally brought her home to the duke's estate. That was when she found out the truth—she'd been swapped at birth.

The greedy couple who raised her had traded her away and left her to suffer five bitter years.

She'd thought that returning to her real family meant love and acceptance. But what she got instead was coldness.

Her parents and brothers barely looked at her.

Whenever Willow Monson—the girl who'd lived her life—felt sad or neglected, they rushed to comfort her, as if she were the real daughter.

Little by little, Athena was pushed aside.

They constantly reminded her, ""You're the older sister. You should be the mature one. Be patient with Willow. Don't fight. Don't compete.""

Wanting so desperately to belong, Athena did as she was told. She gave way in everything, always stepping aside for Willow.

Three years ago, she even made pastries by hand to try to please her.

But Willow ended up poisoned—vomiting blood.

Their parents were furious. They said Athena's years away had corrupted her to the bone. Said she wasn't worthy of being their daughter.

Egged on by Willow's whispers, they decided to send her away—banished from Pidence City forever.

Even the brothers who once adored her said, ""Willow might've enjoyed your life for over a decade, but she's innocent. How could you use such cruel tactics just to win attention? We don't have a sister as heartless as you!""

No matter how Athena tried to explain, no one believed her. Not once.

The moment Willow shed a tear, the blame fell on Athena.

In the end, it was Michael who stepped in to stop them from sending her away.

But he didn't save her. He simply had her quietly dumped in the military camp—believing that after enough suffering, she'd finally learn her place.

A gust of wind lifted the tangled strands of Athena's hair, revealing her emaciated, unrecognizable face.

Michael scowled. ""Get up. We're going back to the estate.""

Athena tried, but her legs gave out beneath her, and she crumpled to the ground again.

Michael turned back, his eyes flashing cold steel. ""If you'd rather not go back… then drag yourself back into that camp.""

# 2.Chapter 2 Realize Your Mistake?

Athena lowered her gaze, gritted her teeth, and forced herself to stand. She didn't say a word as she clumsily climbed into the carriage, using both hands and knees.

Her legs throbbed with pain, barely able to hold her, and she looked completely wretched.

Michael turned away, refusing to watch. He had assumed three years of punishment would be enough to wear down her spirit, but the moment they met again, she was already trying to play the victim—putting on a show to win his sympathy.

If it hadn't been for that person's orders, he wouldn't have come for her at all.

What baffled him was why someone of such high rank would even notice Athena—let alone give an order about her the moment he returned to Pidence City.

Michael was the first to get out of the carriage. Without a glance back, he instructed his men, ""I have business back at camp. After you drop her off, get rid of the carriage—I don't want to see it again. It's filthy.""

Filthy. The word hit her like a slap. Athena's chest ached with a dull, sinking pain. She sniffed quietly, face devoid of emotion, and stepped down from the carriage.

Outside the towering red gates of the duke's estate, a woman was already waiting. The moment she saw Athena, she rushed over, eyes full of urgency.

But the first thing she said was, ""My sweet daughter, it's been three years. Have you finally realized your mistake?""

""I have,"" Athena replied flatly.

Her mistake had been wanting love too much. This time, she would sever those ties—for good. Just… not yet. Not while Margaret Monson, her grandmother, still needed her care.

Eloise Monson looked at Athena, her daughter—so thin and pale, her eyes distant—and her expression faltered.

Three years of hardship had changed Athena completely. Just one look was enough to make her heart ache.

No matter how deeply Athena had erred, she was still her daughter—still her flesh and blood. And she had clearly paid the price.

""It's good you understand now,"" Eloise said softly. ""You mustn't be so willful again. Come on, get up."" She reached out to help.

But Athena immediately stood up on her own and took a step back, putting distance between them. Her eyes were guarded, cautious.

Eloise's heart twisted. ""You blame me for being too harsh? But I did it for your own good—for your future! What mother doesn't want the best for her child?""

Her eyes turned red, her voice trembling with a hint of tears. ""Don't hold it against me…""

Her face was full of sorrow, as though she were the one who'd suffered for three years.

Athena stood there, unmoved, making no effort to bridge the gap between them.

Just then, a slender figure stepped gracefully out of the manor and gently supported Eloise's arm.

""Mother, Athena's just come home. She's probably overwhelmed. Don't be upset if she seems distant—give her a little time, all right?""

The girl was delicate and fair, with porcelain skin and a sweet, innocent smile.

She turned to Athena and extended her hand, her eyes wide with sincerity. ""Athena, I don't hold anything against you. Let's forget the past, okay? We're still family—we should love each other, just like before.""

Her smile was as gentle and harmless as ever.

Athena almost laughed out loud. After everything she'd endured, she wondered, 'Do they really think a few nice words can just wipe it all away?'

""Love? Between you and me?"" Disgust flickered in her eyes.

That was when someone finally lost patience.

""Willow's already gone out of her way to be kind to you, and you're still acting like this? What's wrong with your attitude?""

Nicolas Monson had just come from court, still in his crimson official robes. He swung off his horse and walked over, clearly irritated.

""You think you're the only one who's suffered these past three years? Do you have any idea what Mother's been through? She's lost sleep night after night, her hair's turning white!

""If it weren't for Willow taking care of her and fulfilling your duties, who knows what would've happened?""

Nicolas had seen the whole scene earlier—Eloise's joy quickly deflated, Willow's soft voice met with Athena's cold rejection.

Nicolas thought, 'And all because of three years of punishment? What right does she have to act wronged? Willow almost died.'

Eloise frowned at Nicolas, her son, clearly disapproving. ""Don't exaggerate. She just got back. As her big brother, you should be gentler with her. Don't scare her.""

""Mother, you don't need to defend her. The Monson family owes her nothing. She's the one who made the mistake. And because of her, our entire household's reputation suffered.

""Everyone in Pidence City knows the Duke's family raised a vicious, manipulative girl. And Willow? She never complained—she's done everything she could to protect this family.""

Nicolas still hadn't calmed down.

""Athena! Willow even covered for you—she told everyone you never poisoned her, just to protect your name. Shouldn't you be grateful?"" he continued.

When Athena said nothing, his voice rose sharply. ""Say something! Are you mute now?""

Athena blinked, struggling to hold back the sting in her eyes.

Once upon a time, Nicolas had been different. Unlike her second and third brothers, he had been the one who truly cared for her.

He once told her he'd split the love he gave Willow and give half to her—and for a while, he meant it.

When the servants looked down on her, he gave out thirty lashes on her behalf. On her birthday, he carved a jewel pendant for her by hand. When she was sick, he stayed by her side through the night.

But all that kindness vanished the moment Willow acted hurt.

Love that could be so easily withdrawn—that kind of love, she no longer wanted.

The air between them turned stiff with silence.

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""What's done is done. Let's go inside—your father and grandmother are still waiting.""

Nicolas scoffed and gave a dismissive wave of his sleeve as he turned toward the estate.

After a few steps, he looked back, his voice suddenly soft. ""Willow, come here.""

""Yes, Nicolas."" She smiled sweetly, casting a glance at Athena. She said nothing—but somehow, it said everything.

Athena was used to it by now. She had always been the outsider in this family.

She had already made up her mind: she would let go. Let Willow have all of it—Michael, her parents, her brothers.

But even with that resolve, watching this unfold still made her throat tighten and her eyes sting.

# 3.Chapter 3 Oversized Clothes

Eloise led Athena through the gates of the estate, turning to the servants as they entered. ""Take Lady Athena to wash up first. After that, she'll go pay her respects to Lady Margaret.""

Then she looked at Athena with a gentle smile. ""Your grandmother's getting on in years. Her health hasn't been great—she's been relying on herbal tonics these past few years. When you see her, be sweet and respectful, and don't bring up anything about the last three years. It'll only upset her.""

Athena nodded quietly.

Margaret had always been the most fair-minded person in the family—but she was too old now to involve herself in household affairs.

Seeing Athena accept her words without protest, Eloise finally relaxed a little.

She continued, testing the waters, ""You're eighteen now—of marriageable age. What happened in the camp... let's not mention it again. If word gets out that you spent the last three years living among soldiers, day and night, people will start talking.

""That kind of gossip could ruin your chances of a good match. I've already come up with an explanation. We'll say you were away recuperating, and now you've just returned.""

Athena's face remained calm. She gave a soft ""Yes,"" then followed the maid assigned to her.

But after a few turns, she realized something was wrong. This wasn't the way to her old courtyard.

She asked, and the maid smiled brightly as she explained, ""Lady Willow has been in poor health for years. The doctor said the trees in your courtyard were too damp and affected her health. So they were all cut down.

""To help her recover, they leveled your courtyard and merged it with hers. They even diverted hot spring water to the new space for her treatment. But don't worry, Lady Eloise had this new courtyard cleaned and prepared for you before your return.""

The maid said it as if it were completely normal, perfectly reasonable.

As if everyone had conveniently forgotten that Athena was the true daughter of the house—while Willow was merely adopted.

The maid led Athena to a small, modest courtyard and pushed the door open. ""You'll be staying here from now on, Lady Athena.""

The space was much smaller than her original quarters, and with no greenery in sight, it looked bare and lifeless.

Two unfamiliar maids stepped forward and bowed. ""Lady Athena.""

Athena didn't recognize either of them. After three years away, most of the household staff had changed.

One had a round face, the other an oval one. Both were attractive and sharp-eyed—clearly selected for looks and cleverness.

""I'm Siena Hotham.""

""I'm Aliza Crofton.""

Together, they echoed, ""Hi, Lady Athena.""

Athena gave a small nod and motioned for them to rise.

Then she asked, ""Where are Thalia and Macy?""

Those had been her personal maids before she was sent away. But once she entered the military camp, all news of them vanished.

The maid smiled and replied, ""Not long after you left, they both got married. I imagine they're living quiet, peaceful lives now—looking after their husbands and raising children.""

Athena nodded. A peaceful life sounded good. Far better than serving others for the rest of your days.

The thought brought a faint sense of ease. She stepped inside.

The table was already set. The meal was generous—four dishes and a soup—but the plates were no bigger than a clenched fist.

She began to eat. One plate of pasta disappeared in just a few bites.

Her brows knit slightly. ""Is there more?""

Siena looked momentarily stunned, then quickly nodded. ""Yes, of course, I'll get it right away.""

Watching her eat so fast, Aliza spoke up gently, ""Lady Athena, please slow down. You'll upset your stomach if you rush like that.""

Athena's fork paused in mid-air. She had nearly forgotten—this wasn't the military camp anymore.

This was the duke's estate. No one here was going to snatch her food. No one would dump kitchen slop onto her plate.

The pasta was fragrant. The dishes were fresh. And the meat—it was real bacon. Not rat. Not snake.

Siena returned with two more plates of pasta.

Athena ate quickly and without grace. There was nothing delicate or refined in her manners—she looked more like a starving beggar than a noble daughter.

Siena opened her mouth several times to speak but held her tongue each time.

After the meal, the servants had already prepared hot water for her bath. Siena and Aliza followed her in. ""Lady Athena, allow us to help you bathe,"" Siena offered politely.

""That won't be necessary. You can leave."" Athena said.

Siena hesitated, clearly unsure.

Aliza added with concern, ""If Lady Eloise finds out, she'll punish us for not serving you properly…""

Athena didn't speak. She simply looked at them—calm, expressionless.

There was no anger in her eyes, no emotion at all. But the chill behind that blank gaze made both girls shiver.

Without another word, they backed out of the room and quietly closed the door behind them.

Only then did Athena step behind the screen and begin undressing.

Her body was gaunt, skin stretched tightly over bone. Her once-fair skin was now covered in bruises—some new, others long faded.

If she hadn't known medicine, she would have died in that place.

After washing, she reached for the fresh clothes laid out on the rack. The fabric was fine—soft, warm, and tailored to fit.

But on her starved frame, the robe hung loose and shapeless, making her look more like a walking skeleton than a noble daughter.

""Lady Athena, Lady Eloise and the Lady Margaret are waiting,"" Aliza reminded her from outside.

Athena nodded and made her way toward Starling House.

In just three years, the duke's estate had changed so much.

She paused at the edge of the pond, lost in thought. ""What happened to the lotuses?"" she asked.

""Lady Willow said there were too many mosquitoes in summer,"" Aliza replied. ""So Lord Nicolas had them all removed.""

Athena thought, 'Of course. Willow—again.' Athena felt a familiar ache in her chest.

When she had first arrived at the estate, she tried so hard to win everyone over.

She had planted those lotuses herself, hoping to make wine from the blossoms and gift it to Nicolas.

He had laughed at her back then. ""You're my sister. There's no need for all that. But if it makes you happy, I'll help you plant them.""

The proud, aloof heir of the house had actually gotten his hands dirty—for her.

At the time, Athena had thought, 'So this is what it feels like to be cherished.'

But now… it was clear. Whatever kindness they'd shown her didn't come close to how they treated Willow. Not even a tenth of it.

She arrived at Margaret's quarters. The room was already full.

Eloise looked toward the door—and frowned. She wondered, 'Why does the robe look so oversized on Athena?'

# 4.Chapter 4 The One To Blame

Before Athena could say a word, Nicolas stepped forward, blocking Margaret's view.

""Athena! Are you doing this on purpose?"" he snapped. ""Three years weren't enough to teach you some manners? Still playing your little games? You've really let me down!""

""I told you to present yourself properly. What are you wearing?"" His expression was full of disapproval, his tone unconsciously laced with the stern authority of a Justice Ministry official.

He looked at her like she was standing trial. ""If you've got complaints, direct them at me. Why come here and put on a show in front of Grandmother? Are you trying to make her feel sorry for you? Do you want to upset her so badly she falls ill?""

Athena almost laughed out loud.

She raised an eyebrow, her smile cool and detached. ""The clothes? Lady Eloise picked them out. What did you expect me to wear—what I came back in from the military camp?""

That shut him up. For a moment, Nicolas was at a loss. She had called Eloise ""Lady Eloise""—not ""Mother.""

Only then did it hit him: ever since Athena returned, she hadn't regarded him as brother once either.

A flicker of unease crept into his chest. The harsh words caught in his throat and never made it out.

His gaze narrowed, a thought nagging at the back of his mind. 'It's only been three years… how did she waste away like this?'

Eloise quickly stepped in to smooth things over. ""That was my oversight. Don't be too hard on Athena.""

Nicolas stepped aside, allowing Athena to enter.

Margaret's eyes lit up the moment she saw her.

""Come here, come,"" she called, voice trembling slightly. ""Let me take a good look at you.""

That warmth, that longing in her eyes—Athena felt her nose sting. She stepped forward and let Margaret take her hands and look her over from head to toe.

""How did you get so thin?"" Margaret pulled her into a hug, holding her tightly, voice choked with emotion. ""My sweet girl… you've suffered. It's all my fault. I'm too old, too useless… I couldn't protect you…""

Athena knew how things had gone. Back then, Margaret had stood by her, even if it meant alienating the rest of the family. Her health had already been fragile.

The fact she'd made it through these years at all was a miracle. If not for the empire's strict laws, no one knew what would've happened…

She wrapped her arms around Margaret, and whispered through a tight throat, ""Grandmother.""

Just one word—and Margaret broke down completely, tears streaming down her face.

Off to the side, Eloise watched the reunion, a pang of bitterness tightening in her chest.

Athena had been home for some time now… and still hadn't called her ""Mother.""

She dabbed at her eyes with a silk handkerchief, playing the part of the grieving parent.

Willow stepped up, gently hugging her. ""Don't be sad, Mother. Athena's home now."" Her voice was soft, comforting, obedient.

Eloise looked down at her beloved Willow and felt deeply comforted.

She nodded, eyes still wet, but a faint smile tugging at her lips. She thought, 'At least Willow understands.'

But just as she started to feel at ease, that smile froze.

Margaret's voice, quivering and confused, rang out, ""What's going on?""

Athena's once delicate fingers were now covered in scars—blackened bruises and jagged welts. When she lifted her sleeve, old knife wounds and fresh burns marred the skin along her arms.

Margaret's gaze faltered. She couldn't bear to look any longer. ""She was sent to do labor… how did she end up like this?""

Eloise looked genuinely shocked. ""These injuries—how did they happen?""

Surrounded by concerned faces, Athena buried the emptiness in her eyes and replied softly, ""They came from the overseers at the camp, of course…""

Gasps rippled through the room. Athena's lips curled into a faint, mocking smile. ""I was there to work, not to be treated like a young lady. Getting beaten was just part of the routine.""

She didn't say more. Even recalling it made her stomach turn.

But her few words had already shaken everyone to the core. They thought, 'Beaten—for three full years. How has she even survived?'

Margaret's hands trembled as she clutched Athena's. ""How could they? How dare they? You're the duke's daughter! That camp was under your fiancé's command—how could anyone there lay a finger on you?""

Athena's smile grew, cold and biting. ""Because someone gave the order.""

Nicolas's face turned red with fury. ""You really are useless. You let them beat you like that and didn't even fight back?""

Athena's voice stayed flat, almost detached. ""Do you think a place like that gave me the right to speak, let alone resist? Being quiet and obedient meant fewer beatings. That's the reality.""

She looked directly at him, that faint smile still on her lips. ""Isn't that what you wanted, Lord Nicolas? For me to behave? To finally be 'taught a lesson'? Well, I've learned it. I'm quiet now. Isn't that what makes you happy?""

Nicolas stared at her in silence.

She was smiling, yes—but it never reached her eyes. She hadn't said a single word of accusation, yet the guilt hit him like a knife to the chest.

His expression began to soften, just as he opened his mouth to speak—when Willow's voice suddenly broke in.

""This is all my fault. I'm the one who should be blamed. If my body weren't so weak—if I hadn't reacted badly to the medicine—Athena never would've been punished.

""I was never meant to belong to this family anyway. Maybe… maybe I should go live in the countryside with my birth parents…""

She dissolved into sobs, her voice quivering with each breath. Tears streamed freely down her face, as if she were the one who had suffered.

Immediately, Eloise rushed to her side, flustered, gently stroking her back. ""There, don't cry, darling. You'll make yourself sick.""

Nicolas jumped in too, alarmed. ""You know how fragile your health is—what are you doing, crying like this? If I'd known, I never would've let you come. Now look what's happened.""

Then he turned, casting a sharp look at Athena. As if to say, ""Why do you have to show those wounds? Now Grandmother is heartbroken, Willow is in tears, and Mother is riddled with guilt.""

Before long, everyone in the room was fussing over Willow—offering her coffee, passing her medicine, soothing her with kind words.

And Athena? She stood there alone, forgotten, as if she were nothing more than a bystander.

But of course… she wasn't a bystander. She was the cause. The reason for their guilt, their worry, their pain. The one to blame.

# 5.Chapter 5 Should Leave You There

Just then, the Duke of Suffield—Henry Monson—walked into the room.

His commanding gaze swept over everyone before lingering for a moment on Athena. Then, turning to Margaret, he bowed respectfully. ""Mother.""

Margaret quickly waved him up. ""No need for that, get up.""

After he rose, Nicolas and Willow both greeted him warmly. ""Father.""

Only Athena, calm and detached, said, ""Duke of Suffield.""

That one phrase froze the air in the room.

Henry frowned, as if he hadn't heard her right. ""What did you call me?""

A hint of anger crept into his expression.

Athena lowered her eyes and repeated softly, ""Duke of Suffield.""

Smack! The sound of the slap echoed through the hall as Athena's head snapped to the side.

""You ungrateful thing. Three years in the camp, and you still haven't learned a single ounce of humility?"" he roared.

He continued, ""Calling me 'Duke of Suffield'—what, you trying to cut ties with the family? If you still don't know your place, go back to the military camp and stay there! We don't need a disgrace like you in this household!""

Eloise rushed forward, throwing her arms around Athena protectively. ""Enough! If you have to hit someone, then hit me!""

Margaret rose to her feet, trembling with fury, and lifted her cane to strike Henry.

Tears streamed down her face as she shouted, ""Do you have any idea what she's been through these past three years? And now, right in front of me, you hit her? You might as well be hitting me!""

She had only just started to mend Athena's wounded heart. And now, with a single slap, he'd torn it wide open again. He was her father. Her biological father.

Margaret tried to fight for her—but her cane never landed. The moment she raised it, servants rushed in and stopped her. She didn't even touch his robes.

Athena stood silently off to the side, watching the chaos unfold, her expression cold and unreadable.

She thought, 'So this is the family that promises never to hurt me again. How absurd.'

Eloise turned in a panic to check Athena's face—but before she could, a sudden cry rang out. It was Willow.

Everyone turned. A thin trail of blood was trickling from her temple.

The room fell dead silent.

Henry's face twisted in alarm as he called out, ""Quick! Call the physician!""

Nicolas's eyes were red, his brows deeply furrowed. He looked like he'd rather have taken the injury himself. He said, ""Why would you rush in like that? What if it scars? She can handle it—she's used to it. But you? You're delicate. You shouldn't be hurt like this…""

Willow's voice was soft and trembling, her eyes filled with tears that clung to her lashes. ""I was just scared Father might get hurt… I didn't even think. I just moved.""

When Willow spoke, Henry's heart ached even more.

Everyone in the room hovered around Willow, fussing over her.

Meanwhile, Athena stood quietly to the side, her cheek visibly swollen—yet no one paid her any attention.

She said nothing. A flicker of cold amusement passed through her eyes.

When Henry slapped her, Eloise didn't even flinch.

But the moment Willow was accidentally hurt, that same ""mother"" had panicked like her life depended on it.

Anyone watching would've thought Willow was her real daughter.

Henry, still full of concern, didn't forget to glare at Athena.

He said, ""If it weren't for you, none of this would've happened. Honestly, we never should've brought you back thirteen years ago. Should've left you where you were.""

Nicolas also gave her a disapproving look—but when he saw the bruise on her face, he hesitated, and swallowed his words.

""Enough. That's enough. All of you, out,"" Margaret said with a headache brewing behind her temples.

""Yes,"" the others responded, withdrawing.

Margaret gently took Athena's hand and began applying medicine to her swollen cheek herself.

She said, ""Athena, don't hold it against your father. He's got a temper. But from now on, I won't let anyone hurt you again.""

Looking into Margaret's loving, weathered eyes, Athena couldn't bring herself to say the sharp words that had been sitting on the tip of her tongue.

""Of course not,"" she replied, forcing a quiet smile.

Margaret sighed. She wanted to say more, but fatigue overtook her. She waved Athena off to rest. ""We'll talk later.""

After helping Margaret lie down, Athena finally returned to her courtyard.

She had barely sat down when a familiar voice called from outside. ""Athena, are you asleep?""

Irritation flickered across Athena's face. She signaled for Siena to open the door.

Eloise stepped inside. Her gaze landed immediately on Athena's swollen cheek. She walked over, her voice gentle. ""Does it still hurt?""

Athena stared at her, silent, as if asking a question without words.

Eloise quickly realized how foolish her concern must have sounded. She hurried to continue, ""Athena, I brought you some wound medicine from Harmony Apothecary. This one's made by a famous physician—it's the best.

""The healer's been missing for three years now. His medicine is nearly impossible to find. Use it sparingly—it'll fade your bruises in less than a month.""

She reached out, tucking a loose strand of Athena's hair behind her ear. ""Athena, I've let you down. I didn't protect you when you needed it. If you're angry, blame me. Just… don't take it out on anyone else.

""From now on, I'll treat you right. I promise.""

She pressed the medicine jar into Athena's hand. Athena opened it—and saw right away that it was half empty.

She knew this medicine. She was the one who produced it. She knew exactly how much was supposed to be in a full jar.

Of course. It had been used already. Passed down to her only after someone else didn't need it anymore.

Eloise noticed her silence and felt a sting of disappointment.

Athena hadn't always been like this. She used to smile at everything she was given. Used to sweetly call her ""Mother,"" like it meant something.

Now, she was distant. Cold. A stranger.

'Willow would never act like this,' she thought. 'That child is so thoughtful, so gentle.'

""Well, I'll let you rest. I'll stop by again tomorrow,"" Eloise said.

Athena stood. ""Take care, Lady Eloise.""

She made no move to walk her out. Eloise hid her disappointment, turned, and left with slow, unsteady steps.

Athena watched her go, a faint crease forming between her brows.

She thought, 'If not for Margaret's illness… I wouldn't stay in this house another day.'",1,1752581932.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Balanced Meals  

• Combine complex carbohydrates, lean protein, and healthy fats to maintain steady energy release throughout the day.  

• Practical options include oatmeal with berries and nuts, or a quinoa bowl topped with chickpeas and avocado.


Hydration  

• Research shows that even mild dehydration of 1–2% can impair concentration and memory.  

• Aim for eight to ten glasses of water daily; infuse with citrus or herbs if you prefer flavor.


Smart Snacks  

• Dark chocolate containing at least 70% cocoa provides flavonoids that enhance cerebral blood flow.  

• Mixed nuts supply omega-3 fatty acids and magnesium, both linked to cognitive health.


Caffeine Strategy  

• Up to 200 mg of caffeine from coffee or tea can improve alertness, but avoid consumption within six hours of bedtime to protect sleep quality.  

• Pair caffeinated beverages with fiber-rich snacks to prevent energy crashes.


Sleep-Supportive Foods  

• Late-night study sessions benefit from kiwifruit or tart-cherry juice, both shown to boost natural melatonin production.  

• Limit sugary or highly processed drinks in the evening to avoid blood-sugar fluctuations that disrupt sleep.

1m0g6aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Upset_Ad_4829/comments/1m0g6aw/herbal_tea_vs_normal_tea/,Herbal Tea Vs Normal Tea,"At Passiflora, we’ve often seen people curious about herbal teas — especially how they differ from regular tea or coffee.

Let’s break it down simply.

# ☕ Two Cups, Two Stories

One cup of tea gives you energy — a companion for your meetings, deadlines, and morning hustle. Think black tea or coffee. It’s stimulating and helps you stay alert.

But the **other cup**? It's for winding down. Maybe right before bed or when you're feeling stressed. Herbal teas tend to be floral, naturally sweet, and deeply soothing — designed to relax your nervous system and support recovery.

# 🔋 Caffeine: Fuel or Crash?

Milk tea, green tea, and especially coffee are loaded with caffeine. That gives you a quick boost — but sometimes, a crash follows.

Herbal teas, on the other hand, often contain **little to no caffeine**. They’re made more for balance than a buzz, helping you rejuvenate without over-stimulating your system.

# 🌿 Where Do They Come From?

Regular teas (black, green, oolong) all come from a single plant: **Camellia sinensis**.

Herbal teas? They're brewed from **a blend of botanicals** like tulsi, chamomile, rose, licorice, and many more — each offering its own wellness benefit. When thoughtfully combined, they work synergistically to support the body.

# 🧽 Detoxifying Properties

Certain herbs support your body’s natural detox systems — especially the **liver, kidneys, lymphatic system, and digestive tract**. That’s why many people turn to herbal teas as a gentle daily detox aid.

# 💚 Our Blends Are Crafted with Care

Each herbal blend is thoughtfully formulated — from sourcing clean, potent herbs to ensuring each pouch is packed with purpose.

Some of our personal favorite themes:

* **Ageless Grace** – For antioxidant support & graceful aging
* **Calm Essence** – Helps calm the nerves & ease into restful sleep
* **Glow Beauty** – Skin-nourishing herbs for natural radiance
* **Happy Hormones** – Balancing support for women’s cycles
* **Liver Wellness** – Gentle detox and digestive support

All of them are rooted in the idea of **plant-based self-care**.

We’re not here to sell — just to share how herbal teas can be more than a drink. They can be **a wellness ritual**. If you’re into holistic health or trying to reduce caffeine, these alternatives are worth exploring.

If you’ve got favorite blends or rituals, we’d love to hear them too. 🌿
