Refuses to untangle Mercy at times when she is right near her feet and jokes about how the cat could hurt herself instead of helping the cat. 

Says she is tired after walking a few feet.

Went to a standalone store yesterday and they were doing in-house orders only as they turned off their online ordering. No biggie, I could wait. 

There were three employees - one was on register and hopping onto help when she could (a couple people ordered nitro and she did those plus food) and one other was doing basically everything else. 

The problem I kinda saw was who I think was manager just stocking food and labelling it. They had maybe 3 food orders in the 15 minutes I was there. He ignored the growing line of people ordering and waiting for drinks, the poor bariatas were trying to get 15 orders done at once and he very blatantly kept his back to the entire counter. As someone who's workd retail I have an idea of when employees purposefully put blinders on to ignore customers. 

I'm want to report it but don't want to report it if it's something he was required to do right then and there
He was basically pulling food out from the back and label dating it. I don't love complaining especially when the two others were really hustling (and one woman in front got super huffy they wouldn't break a $50 bill for a tall hot coffee üôÉ)

I (31 F) have lived where I live for about a year and a half. I have 4 roommates, which sounds like a lot but this is a big house. One of my roommates, I'll refer to her as P, quickly became a good friend. I thoroughly enjoy being around her and I appreciate her help around the house. That makes this much more awkward. 
A few weeks ago, I realized that at least 3 of us who live here consistently have diarrhea or other stomach issues. I started paying attention and noticed that P almost never washes her hands before cooking for everyone. 
For context, I am serve safe certified and it is well known that the most common cause of gastrointestinal problems is contaminated food, which includes food prepared by unclean hands. I have tried sharing information about food safety with her multiple times. About a week ago I stopped eating food that she cooks. I no longer have stomach issues, and the other two roommates still do. 
Today, I finally said that I'm tired of having diarrhea. She interrupted me to sat that ""well its probably because you drink coffee or because you've been swallowing phlegm."" I have had a cold but I don't swallow my phlegm anyway. 
I feel like my concerns  have been dismissed repeatedly. I can't make my point because she won't let me finish. Other things have started happening to. She even interrupts me when I talk to my fianc√©, and she usually does so in order to say something to him. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to talk to her.

He committed both EI and CI against me from my childhood into my adulthood. The way it came out was embarrassing. Something I kept secret for so long came out in front of my mom and stepdad and my husband. So much pent up anger and confusion came boiling over. I had a mental breakdown. I went from spending 2 hours on the phone with him one day to direct no contact. Everyone immediately blocked him. He filed a missing persons report on me (he lives in a different country). 

He had emotionally manipulated and groomed me into care taking for him and guilting me into spending time with him and saving him from himself and his depression and loneliness. He caused a lot of damage after what he did to me growing up. He said and did a lot of creepy and sexual things, but the worst were the long FULL body massages he give while basically grinding on me. At a young age I thought this was just a way of being affectionate. He was always overly affectionate, spooning me and holding onto body parts he should have kept his hands off. It wasn't until I was a teenager that I started to protest, but when I'd argue that no one else I knew really did this kind of thing with their parents he'd always insist it was innocent and loving and get his way complaining that human beings need touch and as a divorcee with no friends he was starved and sad all the time. Things escalated when I moved out of my mom's house and into his at 18. This continued till I was 19, got a boyfriend and moved out. He would insist I was the only reason he had to live for.

I told my stepsister last year when we were catching up and she admitted that she'd had a couple unsavory experiences alone with my dad. 

I'm struggling right now because even though I know I'm right for what I did, the inner child in me wants to check up on my dad and make sure he's okay. It wants to step back into a caregiving role. My brain has only been playing the happy memories now instead of the grody ones and I find myself missing him and questioning if I did the right thing by cutting him off so suddenly and so finally. 

His friend (a dear family friend I've known since I was in diapers) wants to have coffee with me soon, I'm sure to report back to my dad. I don't know what to do. Has anyone reopened contact with their parent? Was it a good idea? Horrible? Worth it? Useless? Cathartic? Traumatic? 

I need help figuring out what to do. Half of me wants to commit to my decision and the other half wants to see what happens if I open that door again. It's weird loving and hating someone at the same time. ",1,1731340749.0,CovertIncest,0,1.0,False

Our kitten was three months at the time and we absolutely fell in love with him. We noticed once we brought him home and he acclimated to us, that he had a big, energetic personality. We chalked it down to age, being free from a kennel, etc.

Now, several months later, his adorable energy has completely wrecked our home and we, now newly expecting our first baby on the way, are at a complete loss of what to do. 

He climbs, scratches and chews everything. EVERYTHING. New curtains? All ripped. New couches, scratched up. I bought a new book I left out overnight? He‚Äôs chewed through the pages. My phone case is scratched, lamps have been broken, my husband‚Äôs brand new expensive hat, torn up. Brand new coffee table? wood is already covered in scratches. Our headboard is completely scratched up as well - I mean it‚Äôs pure chaos. (Worse than a puppy my mom jokes).

We‚Äôve tried so many things. Spray bottles, anti-scratch sprays, feeding to make sure it‚Äôs not a hunger issue, lots of toys and love. This cat is so spoiled but we have tried to balance the love with discipline when necessary as well to no avail. Also he‚Äôs fixed. They told us that would calm him down, but apparently not.

Also the meowing and door scratching. I grew up with cats, never have I met one so vocal. He‚Äôll meow through all hours of the night, high pitched and repeatedly. We live with multiple neighbors next door and Im sure they hear it too. He scratches and throws himself at closed doors until he‚Äôs let in, until two seconds later he decides he wants back out. And then he‚Äôll repeat this until you stop whatever you‚Äôre doing and pick him up to cuddle. (We‚Äôve tried the ‚Äújust ignore him‚Äù pet trick too. BELIEVE ME that does NOTHING). 

His litter also stinks up the entire house (?). We‚Äôve tried different food brands and litter brands. It‚Äôs disgusting. He must go at least five times a day. And of course as cats do, as soon as he‚Äôs finished he zooms around like crazy immediately after, so we‚Äôre left with a super stinky house and a cat jumping on and racing around everything. 

He‚Äôs just so destructive, and it feels like he‚Äôs completely taken over our home. A home that didn‚Äôt feel small until he joined it. We can‚Äôt get another cat to join him, we‚Äôd feel horrible and irresponsible giving him away. He‚Äôs made me cry out of frustration multiple times because he just can‚Äôt seem to relax. We try our best to make our home a beautiful space in this economy with what we can, and for immediately brand new items to get destroyed, my husband and I hardly want to be home.

Suffice to say, I don't know the rules about early or casual dating. I want to do it ethically, empathetically and avoid hurting or ghosting anyone.

But sometimes things just fizzle out without clear closure, so I am not sure about the difference between a mutual fade vs. ghosting and what the rules are. Any rules you can share?

Here are two situations and you can let me know if I am handling it right or what to do? Both these girls told me they aren't big texters btw. For context, I am dating in the US but I am foreign and so are both girls (born and raised in latin america).

1. I went on three casual dates with this girl, our time consisted mainly of drinking and making out in bars. The second and third dates ended up at her place and we slept together on the third date. She then went out of town for several weeks. After seeing her for the last time, I sent her a couple of casual texts to stay in touch. She responded briefly. She never reached out to tell me she got back in town. I stopped texting her anymore, because I wanted to see if she had any genuine interest in reaching out on her own and also because I wasn't really feeling it anymore. So we just let it fade. Was that ok? I feel a bit bad for leaving things unclear. Technically she texted last, with a brief dead-end response to my text, but there was no expectation of a response, so I don't think I ghosted her. I was kind of expecting her to text me to let me know she was back in town, but not sure if that was clear. But I also didn't want to reach out again just to say I'm not really feeling it anymore, given her lack of interest anyway. That feels like hurting her unnecessarily with a rejection she didn't ask for.

Several months later...

2. Went on three casual bar dates with this other girl. Second and third date ended up at mine and we slept together both times. In between dates its always been like 2 weeks, because we both work a lot and we barely text at all in between. She never texts me first, I will occasionally text her and she takes time to respond, sometimes days. Its been super casual communication. She also went out of town for a couple weeks. Never texted to let me know she was back. A few days after coming back she randomly called me at 3am, which I guess was a booty call. I didn't see it, texted her. She responded saying she just called because she was in the neighborhood. I texted last saying ""that's cool, sorry I didn't see it. If you're coming to the farmers market tomorrow (which I know she often does), how about we go for coffee and you can tell me about your trip?"". That was over a week ago and she hasn't responded. I'm fine to let it fade, because I am not really feeling it anymore. Since I texted her last with an invitation, I guess I'm not ghosting and technically she is ghosting me, so I can just leave it and fade, right? I feel kinda weird with the explicit lack of closure though and wonder if she's expecting me to reach out again.

Also, please forgive my inexperience and naivite lol. Thanks!",1,1731340628.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I need to explain it here because i can't verbalise it in therapy right now, just need some support on what to do from here please. 

So, the worst of the triggers is the CSA which i will spoiler for safety. But the post will talk about physical assault aswell both historical and more recent. 

Honestly, its like i've been thrown through a loop recently. I've been doing well to process traumas with a therapist over 60hours worth of therapy sessions at least 40 of them around regulation/trauma processing etc the rest just keeping things going and learning how to safeguard against winter mood changes as i also have bipolar with seasonal affect. 

About 7 weeks ago i was grabbed by the neck by a patient and they also trapped me in a corner and aimed to punch me in the face. I did get out the room though i don't really remember how right now but i did. 

I have since had about 4 panic attacks at work due to feeling like things have gone wrong  being triggered by something someone has said i.e. one patient explained in detail how he was assaulted as a kid (11 yrs old). I was around a similar age when the most traumatic epiosde of CSA happened. 

My therapist asked me last week if i knew why the attack had set off these symptoms recently and i do know but i can't voice it, she knows vaguly what happened but not details and i just can't explain it verbally. I tend to shutdown verbally when this is triggered. But i can write things down to get things out and it helps somewhat. 

Detail is spoilered below. 

>!so i remember being pinned to a wall being assaulted around 10yrs old, felt a hand on the back of my neck, i remember the feeling of my head being held down and being forced to give oral (this appears to have happened multiple times at this age and later at 13/14  but i don't know how many as most of this is body memories, one was a boyfriend when i was around 13/14, i remember being scared and him forcing me to touch him and hold my head down by my neck!<

There is also something when i was around 21 i was living with a friend we both the same sex (female) and she became abusive and she used to hit me in the face for sleeping, once that i remember she tried to strangle me and then kicked me in the ribs as i was on the floor and she was enraged. 

Around the time i was 29 i went out for a coffee date with someone from work (worked on the same hospital site) we ended up at his flat in which he assaulted me and locked me in his flat with him, again i don't really remember all of it. 

Barely anyone really knows any of this apart from the thing that happened at work as it was witnessed by collegues.

I absoutely hate people touching my neck, i can't have it, my therapist also thinks i'm autistic which could be part of the issue aswell. 

I can't seem to ground, stop the flashbacks or panic attacks so i have been to my doctors to adjust my medications to see if this helps and i'm working with my therapist about the new symptoms i'm struggling with, i am practicing self care as much as i can. 

But i'm really questioning why i'm reacting so badly, if its all really worth it if i'm going to feel this bad forever. It feels like two years ago again where i was first diagnosed and its hard to go back there. I keep telling myself that we are in a better position now but its hard to believe it when i can feel everything happening to my body all over again and its affect sleep/eating/work. 

If anyone has any advise i would be greatful. Sorry for the long post and in seperate places i'm really struggling with everything.

I'm not going to complain about my step sisters, my mother remarried when I had long since left home behind and my step father did not have custody so very rarely met them, even if I know they were total vandals brats, and they once stole my future and last birthday gift from my mother, when the were kids. Not my problem, totally their father's, when he used visitation time to take them to his parents place. My elder sister moved out at the earliest time she could after completing highschool, and I have only had contact with her one singular time since then, a singular visit home to mum's for the holidays, I do not care, I COULD say she was definitely the golden child compared to me, the middle child, but really the favouritism was basically mild, it just so happens out of all three daughters, Mum proved who her favourite was through her choices and actions.

My younger sister started breeding young (before 16) producing 3 kids, a boy and two girls with three different males, married none of them. Eventually she found a man who didn't pull the love em, and leave em pregnant, and head for the hills, make yourself impossible to track and apply for child support racket. Her last lover, who got her pregnant chose to stick around,  at least long enough for the spawn of his lawns to reach adulthood, he simply didn't chose to marry my sister. I am not aware of whether or not he is still in the picture now his daughter is grown.

I got bullied out of home at 14, and rendered homeless, by a combination of Middle child who has bully sister antics, and my mum chosing guys to date who assault (non-sexually) her kids when she steps out of the house while they're there behind her back, then denies it or claims the kid deserved to be displined, for minor things. My mother was not adverse to using over the top beatings as punishment/displine to impress her current lover of the time with her 'displine methods', but she only did that once, in a way that left such blatantly obvious marks, she lost custody of all three of us while her divorce was going on, and for two years, before she 'found religion' and of course being suitable church going/petient got custody back,and never got excessively violent about discipline again. I genuinely beleive if she KNEW her lover at any point was being violent toward any of us, because the action left obvious marks he couldn't avoid being seen, and couldn't get away with claiming she's lying because she doesn't like me, she would have sent any such man packing to avoid losing custody of any or all of us again.

Eventually after my mother remarried, she more or less declared a truce and made up, and at one stage moved into a share house with me and my room-mates, when she was between homes and jobs. THen she eventually brought a farm. I ended up living and working (no pay) on her farm when I was unemployed with no way to pay any bills or any rent for 18 months. My younger sister and her defacto moved into the region with the kids, and my mother often took one child in particular to baby sit to give mum a break, (Autistic) she left me alone on the farm to tend to the animals, while she and her husband saught work in the city to pay the bills while they waited for things to become self funding on the farm. My sister's man was suppoused to come regularily to tend to jobs that needed heavy lifting for which he alledgedly would be paid for performing. I was there for 18 months, I only saw him twice. to cut a long story short, my sister took advantage of me being there to turn me into an unpaid over night baby sister, who's be told to sleep on a ratty flea infested couch with her cattle dog, and be given no food, so her kids could have food to eat, many times. SHe also turned me into her unpaid baby siter for her first child for three weeks straight a bawling constantly infant, that ocassion I didn't mind she was giving birth/dealing with a new born.

When I moved out of the farm, I was talked into alledgely LOANING my sister my expensive (saved up for NEW at time of purchase furniture) on behalf of her kids so she could use it until she could save up and buy decent furniture, that wasn't second hand this included a very expensive combination bunk-home office bedroom setting, a double bed, dining table, coffee table, chairs,  and book cases, and couch and matching side seats. In return I got mum's second hand holes, and stained sofa bed with matching recliners, all with holes, and stains, (still looked nice) so I'd have a couch that could pass as a bed, until I got back what was loaned to my sister. Well My sister NEVER intended to return the furniture she 'loaned' or to pay a fair price for it, I had to buy new furniture to replace it all at a time I could hardly afford it. Bad mark number One, later, when mum took her bratty son to give his mum a break while she ha alternative accomadation in the city a suburb away from where I lived, I got talked yet again into doing unpaid baby sitting, when I was sick and sleep deprived and her son turned into such a total terror, I lost my cool, in a bad way and thankfully (For him) I locked him in his bedroom, and got some sleep, before I carried out my threat to kill the total monster. In my defense I was severely sleep deprived, had a migraine, and was an undiagonsed at that time Schizo creature.

My mother learned her lesson, never do that again, or ask me to baby sit HIM again. Being the aunt I was expected to always remember the kids birthdays, but they NEVER rememebered mine, meaning my family. It was during this period, my mother alledgedly brought me a birthday gift in advance, only for it to he stolen by one of her step daughters, before she could give it to me, that was the very last time she even rememebered my birthday intending to give me a gift. (her new at that time religion doesn't beleive in birthday gift giving) I stupidly kept remebering to say happy birthday to those immediate family members i could contact for years, and sent gifts, or at least brought them intending to pass them at the approrpriate time. I finally chose to end gift giving to people who NEVER said happy birthday, or merry christmas to me, in the first place. 

Now the last time i traced my younger sister who's kids are now all adults in alledged committed relationships and are starting to make her a grandma, It was via Facebook, I dared to say Hi on my birthday, tried to engage in small talk, and got cussed out and basically it was the most offensive possible way she could find to AKNOWLEDGE it was my birthday possible. THis after I remembered her birthday, and said Happy Birthday, wished her well, and mentioned if she gave me contact details, I could send her a gift if she mentioned something useful but not to expensive she'd like for her birthday, twice, at that stage. I chose never to make contact with her again.

Now onto my next gripe, I wanted to buy a house, it was fifty thousand dollars, on a quater acre block somewhere rural, solid brick house, three rooms, in decent shape, just vandalised with the need for some minor TLC, I had half that amount saved, but could not get a bank loan (Disabled pensioner) My mother had told me for years she would assist me to get a bank loan or loan me money if I wanted to buy a house in a rural area since their cheap. when I finally found a house WORTH doing it, and asked for that assistence, the answer was I never said that, and I don't have the money, and I'm restoring my own rural home and can't assist you. WHen I talked to my alledgedly well paid and fully employed nephew, to eventully discuss a temporary loan I could pay off at the rate of 1000 dollars a month, using a caravan as collateral (large one), he took his time responding to claim sorry can't help suddenly sick and don't have the money. when around that time he was bragging on face book about how well employed and well paid he was..and kept doing it for the next 12 months. Translation he lied... Not that I really care, I took a shot, he had the right to say NO, I simply don't feel like it, Just because we're family I'm not obligated to assist you. I would have said that's fine, I only asked because I was trying to raise the remaining funds I needed to buy the house before soeone else snapped it up.

I never did manage to buy such a fine and (cheap) house after, my mother is all promises and hot air, my younger sister is possibly an undiagnosed formally schizo if my parents are right about her terrible mood swings and paranoid tendencies and oh yes, my nephew dared to reach out to famuly when he REALLY was sick, and lost his job, and wanted to go to Russia to visit his lovers family, and asked for a loan of much more money than I did, and wondered why the answer was NO.

I suspect I have cancer, I was intending to make my sisters kids my heirs, i have at least 50 thouand dollars worth of physical assets to pass on, (that might get more valuable as time passes) as well as my savings in the share market, when I croak I have decided for some funny reason to prove I'm a cat lover and donate the cash and shares value to a no-kill cat rescue, and the physical assets to the man, who has given me a roof over my head, and buys things when for some reason my funds are cut off temporarily without saying a word, or expecting repayment (he gets repaid anyway) to chose what he wants to keep, and to sell the rest to donate to the chairty of his choice, though odds are high he might croak before I do. We have a totally platonic relationship going on 20 plus years, who says men can't be platonic friends without expecting sex for favors...

to put it succintly when you are the MOST likely to inherit things from family members with no kids you shouldn't burn all your bridges before that happens.

First of all, turns out people CAN warn you about not being able to reply fast! One of the main issues I had with my ex was that he'd leave me on read for hours while playing something with his friends and it would drive me crazy. I tried my best to explain how it was important to me that he at least says 'text you later' before he vanishes, but no. I'd never get that without fighting. I was talking to one of my new friends from that campaign about our characters and he would disappear for like ten minutes and then come back. I thought nothing of it, but then he texted me, 'hey, sorry that I run away and then come back, I'm in the middle of something here and I'd love to talk to you more about it, but I can only do so in two hours.' He knows me for like five days. This gesture sent shivers down my spine because omg it's so nice and sweet and... Yeah, he was just being polite. I need to up my standards.

Then, interest. Did you know that people ask you questions when they're interested in you? I didn't:). My ex and I were (and still are) nerds and for the first two months we'd only talk about books, movies, games, etc. I, however, would ask him about his life, his school, family, friends, what he did outside of games both video and tt... Never got that back. Yes, we did fight about him not asking me about my interests enough. There was a point where I was extremely excited about that one Minecraft YouTuber I've been watching forever and the new merch he just dropped, my ex shut me up saying, 'do I really have to listen to that crap? you know I don't watch him', all after I've spent 2 hrs talking about this new system he found out and I wasn't really interested in it. Meanwhile, this one guy in this group who clearly has interest in me asks me about how my sister's day went just to text with me for a bit more.

Oh, also... People ask you out! That same guy asked me out just for a hangout (cuz I warned him that I've just been broken up with) and took me out to a cafe where they serve different kind of tea because he knows I hate coffee. My ex refused to get me a can of soda once because he couldn't remember which one I liked. We've been together for a year and a half. I only drink coke zero. I even have a gun made out of them in my room (something I did during covid lol it was popular at the time). And, it all breaks my heart, really. I still miss my ex, but the more I talk to other people, both men and women, I realize that I would not come back to him even if he crawled back begging to take him. So, for all people out there who just left their first ever relationship, as soon as you're ready, go make more friends! It's crazy how at some point pink glasses get broken and you no longer idolize a person you thought you'd marry one day.

When I got sober, I had about two weeks where I focused on myself as if I was a psych ward patient tbh. I stayed in my pajamas and worked on hobbies, keeping to myself. My biggest goal was getting through those couple of weeks sober. 

At week three, I got a bursting amount of motivation and began to aggressively apply for jobs. I landed a few interviews, attend many, got call backs, two offers and took a job. 

The job ended up being an absolute shit show and it couldn‚Äôt have come at a worse time in my life. I was working on healing, but I was deteriorating. No matter what, I went to bed sober every night - and every morning I kept telling myself ‚Äútoday is the day it looks up‚Äù. But the days were not looking up and I was losing my ability to function outside of work. I tried my best, but I couldn‚Äôt handle the toxic atmosphere I found myself in.

I quit, feeling the lowest confidence I had in a long time. It was hard to get out of bed and I had convinced myself I would never feel feelings again. I truly didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever know what it would be like to feel giddy or genuinely happy, ever again. 

I got another job offer from my aggressive applying and interviewing. I had only been at the nightmare job for two months so I still had a couple of opportunities still dwindling down. This job was across country and would pay less, but it seemed promising. I knew that either this would make or break me. But it was a risk I was willing to try. 

Right before I left, around 3 months sober, I had been house sitting. I woke up and went to walk to a coffee shop. RIGHT when I got in line, I felt myself break out in a sweat and slowly began losing my vision. I sat down at the nearest chair and struggled to call 911, because I couldn‚Äôt see my screen through the fog. But I got a hold of them and my husband, and they came to check on me. I had low blood pressure and my EKG was not right. This led to me having to get blood work and my heart checked out.

I still moved and began my new job. The people here were incredibly kind and welcoming - the polar opposite of the previous one I had accepted the job for. I felt like I was worth something, and I had a lot of time to focus on myself and my situation because I was no longer worried about work at every break, every evening, and on weekends. I could FEEL the stress leaving my body. 

I did follow up blood work and things are normalizing. I feel a sense of calm and content in my body now. I‚Äôve been laughing and giggling at things and feel joy again. My moods are leveling out. I have found a balance between work and life again.

I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do any of this if I was still drinking. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôd be here. I had a rough start to sobriety and wanted to share my experience, since it was the opposite of what anyone would expect from sobriety. I didn‚Äôt realize the toll that the stress and pressure was having on my body. I guess my one regret was not taking more time to myself during early sobriety. Jumping into that job was an awful decision, but it was a massive lesson learned. I will forever make sure to do what is in my best interest physically and mentally. There is a limit to what we can tolerate. 

I guess I wanted to share this for people who are realizing sobriety isn‚Äôt what it seemed like it would be. For some people, it‚Äôs glitter and gold right off the bat. For others, you may be faced with more challenges and obstacles than you would expect from the way sobriety is talked about. BUT, in the end, the fight is worth it.

I‚Äôm 6 months sober now, feel better than I have in years, and feeling proud to be here. It took a walloping to get here, but I wouldn‚Äôt take back the decision to quit drinking, ever. I couldn‚Äôt have recognized what was going wrong and found ways to change it if I hadn‚Äôt been of sober mind.

For those having a tough time, hang in there.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, and Lorcana. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' a Japanese and a Spanish course on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

BM was recently visited by CPS (accused of physical neglect) and it seems the other child's father has had ENOUGH. They also don't have a court order. We don't really know him but have met him a few times around the holidays. He and BM have never been in a relationship.

My son is 16, he invited 3-5 friends over, and it‚Äôs a good wholesome time. They play hide and seek, they game on the computer downstairs, they play card games, I order 3 large pizzas and provide snacks. It‚Äôs not cheap in this economy but I believe it‚Äôs important for teenagers to socialize in person and not just online/on discord.

I‚Äôve known most of his friends for years. 

The other night after his friends left I noticed my brand new ps5 remote was missing. It‚Äôs my PlayStation; they didn‚Äôt play it, but it was sitting on the coffee table in the living room and it‚Äôs gone. We just moved into our place 3 months ago; we don‚Äôt have tons of furniture, so it was pretty easy to comb the entire house and see that it is in fact gone, not just misplaced. 

I have my suspicion it is his newest friend Mark. Mark has never been to my house before. He was the only newcomer to the party, and I‚Äôve known the other kids a long time and would be really surprised if it were them.

I told my son game night is on hiatus until the remote is returned. I asked him who he thought took it, and he said he finds it hard to believe anyone took it but if he had to guess it would be mark. I asked him to text his friends and see if it somehow got mixed up in their stuff. I‚Äôm not sure he did, he doesn‚Äôt like to ruffle feathers. 


I replaced the controller. I‚Äôm annoyed, but it is what it is. Where do I go from here? No more game nights? Exclude mark on my hunch? 

I hate to ruin a fun tradition but it makes me feel like I can‚Äôt trust these kids in my house if they‚Äôre capable of stealing from me, and I worry about what else they could take.

In other words, multiple times throughout the day I smell strong sensations (things like burnt rubber, rotting garbage, or tobacco/cigarettes). This is accompanied by a ""burning""(?) feeling that is more akin to something like a really minty sensation in my throat, like the feeling when you smell gasoline but ""sharp"" somehow?

This first started in late 2020, I caught a really really bad case of COVID (pneumonia n all). Towards the tail end of it I started experiencing the smells, as well as strong changes in taste. Things like Coffee, Chocolate, or foods with garlic and onions literally tasted like bitter shit. To put it lightly, it sucked. Over time, this has largely gone away and allowed me to eat foods I like again but the smell issue has strengthened if anything. Before, I would be able to go a couple hours between each onset of these smells, but now I'm lucky if I can catch a 5-10 minute break from it.

Its to the point where it's affecting my ability to do work and hobbies, I'm so repulsed and disgusted 24/7 and always on the verge of throwing up, in all honesty I REALLY want to be rid of it. What should I do? What even is this? Who should I contact?

1gov1l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1gov1l8/hr_the_midnight_diner/,[HR] The Midnight Diner ,"It was almost 2 AM, and let me tell you, I was freezing cold and exhausted. I desperately needed a cup of coffee and a hot meal. Keep in mind this was back before smartphones and GPS, back when if you wanted something while on the open road, you actually had to read a billboard and then follow its directions. So, when I saw a big, illuminated billboard, with a picture of a big stack of pancakes, reading ‚Äú*The Midnight Diner: Open 10 PM thru 5 AM, Seven Days a Week‚Äù* I couldn‚Äôt help but take the next exit and find it.



At first, I thought it was closed; there wasn‚Äôt a single car in the parking lot. Even if there were no customers, I‚Äôd have thought for sure there‚Äôd be employees parked; this place was way too far from any nearby town for anyone to walk to. But then, I saw a waitress through the window, so I parked and went inside.



‚ÄúHi there.‚Äù I said, as I entered. There were three other people in the diner; the waitress, the cook, and a solo customer reading a newspaper.¬† ‚ÄúTable for one, please.‚Äù



And then, the waitress walked over to me. For being so young (I‚Äôd have estimated mid 30‚Äôs), she was exceptionally pale, with hair so white I thought it must‚Äôve been bleached. ‚ÄúYes sir, right this way. Can I get you started with anything to drink?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee; cream and sugar, please.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúComing right up.‚Äù She said.

After getting me my coffee, she said ‚ÄúSo, what brings you out on this stretch of the highway, at this hour?‚Äù

‚ÄúBeen driving all day. I‚Äôm going to surprise my girlfriend tomorrow.‚Äù I said.¬†

‚ÄúOh, so she doesn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre coming.‚Äù The waitress said, in an unexpected and creepy way.

I then made something up. ‚ÄúWell, yeah, she doesn‚Äôt, but um, my friends back in the city, they‚Äôre expecting me. I called them, so that they‚Äôd, um, have a couch ready for me to crash on.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow nice of them.‚Äù she replied, but I could tell she knew I was lying.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a grilled cheese sandwich.‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúFries or potato chips for your side?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúFries.‚Äù I answered.

‚ÄúComing up, sweetie.‚Äù She said to me. And shen turned to the cook and shouted ‚ÄúONE GRILLED CHEESE!‚Äù



While I was sipping my coffee, the man in the newspaper took a look at me. Turns out he was even more deathly pale than the waitress; I smiled and waved at him, hoping he‚Äôd just go back to minding his own business. But then, he bared fangs at me, and growled like an angry cat.

	

By then, I didn‚Äôt even care about my food, I just wanted to be out of there. I left behind a $5 bill for the coffee and tip, and made my way towards the door, only for the waitress to stand in front of it and tell me, ‚ÄúWhere you going, sweetie? I haven‚Äôt even gotten you your sandwich yet.‚Äù

I thought for sure she or someone else was about to hurt me. But then, she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only kidding. Go on, if you must.‚Äù and left the entryway.

I ran to my car, and drove out of that parking lot as fast as possible. I thought I could make it back to the highway, and leave that nightmarish diner behind.

	

But then, as I was taking the road back to the interstate entrance, I saw someone standing smack dab in the center of the street. My headlights weren‚Äôt too good, so I couldn‚Äôt see him in detail, but it was definitely a person. I slammed on the brakes, honked my horn a couple times, and shouted ‚ÄúHEY ASSHOLE, CAN YOU‚Ä¶‚Äù before I realized this was the newspaper reader from back at the diner.	

‚ÄúDamn.‚Äù I said to myself, as he approached the car. I had a gun in my glove box; I never went this far from the city without it. I fired at him, and got lucky. I hit him right in the head with my first shot. His body hit the ground, and I kept driving.



‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I shouted to myself, right before a bat flew towards my car. And then, midair, the bat transformed into the diner‚Äôs cook, and he dropped right onto the hood.	

He then smashed through the window, and I fired. I missed the first time, but then hit him twice in the chest. He fell off the hood, and I tried to continue driving, but my car would no longer start. He must‚Äôve damaged something when he landed on it.

‚ÄúWell shit.‚Äù I muttered to myself.



I got out of the car, and continued on foot. My plan was to make it to the highway on foot, then hitchhike my way back to town, and use a payphone to . But then, I heard the waitress say ‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù behind me.

I turned and fired. I missed. I then fired again, only to hear the *clink* of an empty gun being dry fired.

She then ran up to me, grabbed me with near superhuman strength, and then bit me, in the neck. She then began sucking out my blood; I tried to fight back, but this frail looking woman was as strong as a wrestler. By the time she stopped, I felt so drained of blood that I was only barely clinging to life.

‚ÄúYou know, I was going to just kill you, like I do with most of my customers.‚Äù She said, as I was lying on the ground, helpless listening to her as my life was slipping away. ‚ÄúBut as of tonight, it looks like I could use some more help back at the diner. So, what‚Äôs it going to be; should I drain your veins dry and finish you off now, or want to come back to the diner and work with me?‚Äù

I then made my decision.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My new ‚Äúlife‚Äù isn't all bad. Sure, I miss the people I used to know (I never even got to see my girlfriend one last time), but at least my new job isn‚Äôt terrible. It‚Äôs just diner food, nothing too hard to prepare.

But the best part of the new job is the endless free meals. Every night since I turned, the waitress and I have shared the blood of at least one guest, at The Midnight Diner.

Not looking to pack our days super full or rushing around. Wondering if I have left anything out from the itinerary so far. I have no booked hotels as undecided where to stay so far, wanted to decide on when we go to Fuji Five Lakes region first.

Travel back to Tokyo, maybe stay Ueno? If it easy to travel from Hakone to Ueno and subsequently travel to Narita?)

1gouwox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gouwox/fell_in_love_with_my_best_friend_i_dont_know_what/,Fell in love with my best friend (i don't know what to do),"I'm sorry if this is a common topic to talk about... but it is so overwhelming to experience it and I need to at least write it since I can't talk about this with anyone I know. I (23M) met my best friend (23M) when we entered college on 2019. We met each other through friends in common and I remember he was a little shy and a very quiet guy in general. We didn't get to know each other very well at first because we only took like 2 classes together, but I thought he was a very intelligent nice guy and maybe a little cute lol but nothing more.

I know it is wrong but I assumed he was gay (no reason why, just my gaydar literally), so I started talking to him more and more and eventually he came out to me. I wasn't surprised but I was happy to see him experience new things and eventually he met his current boyfriend. Fast-forward the pandemic came and that is the time when we got really close to each other talking on FaceTime, watching movies on zoom, playing online games or purely messages. He always helped me with homework or any important project.

Once we graduated I left the city for work, so I only could be in our city on weekends, and I started to spend every weekend with him for like 6 months straight. The thing is, he started a new job (june 2024) in which it offices are out of the state (like a 6 hour drive from our city), and he told me that his boss eventually would need him to work presenially, so he worked like 3 months remotely. That's when we started to see each other almost every single day, going to the gym, working together (I also had a remote job), grab drinks, coffee, even going to get my car checked at the auto repair.

Since the day he told me he would have to leave, I started feeling weird, like I was losing something, like a part of me dying, I don't know how to explain it. When he left the city and said goodbye to me, I couldn't stop crying as I was hugging him. Feeling that way shocked me because no one else made me feel that way on a goodbye situation. Not even my own family.

At first I thought I was just emotionally dependent on him, but after meditating it, I just can't deny it anymore. I love him, I'm so in love with him and I love everything about him, I dare say I could marry him... when I see his face I just can't stop thinking about kissing him and hugging him so hard. No one else has ever made me feel more safe, heard, cared about, and mostly loved.

I'm not exactly planning to tell him my feelings because I know he doesn't feel the same for me, also he is generally into older guys (like 35+), he is taken rn, and also, and i don't know if this is a bad idea, we planned since college to be roommates and work at the same place. It looks like that time is getting closer (I already had an interview with his boss).

I also feel kinda bad because I know his bf and he is such a nice person, however my friend once told me that he probably won't marry him because of the age difference, and I notice he is sometimes questioning himself what is going to happen with their relationship (his bf is from our city and now it is a long-distance relationship).

I don't know what to do with all this situation, I just feel like every day I'm more in love with him but i don't wanna do something stupid that could ruin our friendship. I just want him to be happy even if I'm not the reason, but these feelings are so strong I'm scared.",1,1731339160.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1gouv95,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1gouv95/state_of_mind_one_year_later/,State of mind one year later ,"It's been a while since I last wrote here. My wife (34 years old) passed away just over a year ago (September 2023). The months have gone by, and I‚Äôm slowly trying to take control of my daily life again, but it‚Äôs a life that feels much duller and sadder than before. The crying outbursts have become less frequent, but the pain is still sharp, and her absence weighs heavily on me. There are still days when I can hardly do anything because I miss her so intensely‚Äîit‚Äôs paralyzing. Today is one of those days. I‚Äôve tried to put my thoughts into words‚Äîit helps during the hardest moments.

¬†Losing your other half is losing a part of yourself:  
\- It‚Äôs the disappearance of all the familiar touchstones that once gave rhythm to daily life.  
\- It‚Äôs living with the constant reality of absence, felt in every moment, from the morning coffee to the quiet of bedtime.  
\- It‚Äôs losing the person with whom you shared an unspoken bond, the one who made even the smallest moments of life meaningful.  
\-It‚Äôs no longer feeling that instant joy just from their glance or smile.  
\- It‚Äôs experiencing brief moments of happiness, only for them to quickly turn bittersweet when you remember that you can‚Äôt share them anymore.

\- It‚Äôs going through the hardest moments of your life without your closest source of comfort by your side.  
\-It‚Äôs being genuinely happy for the people around you who are celebrating milestones in their lives, but at the same time feeling an overwhelming sadness, knowing that for you, those days are gone, and you won‚Äôt have the chance to make new memories together.  
\-It‚Äôs seeing or hearing something new that you want to share with her, only to be struck with the painful reality that you can‚Äôt seconds after.  
\-It‚Äôs feeling time shift, as if there‚Äôs a clear divide between the ""before"" and ""after."" It feels like an eternity since I last held my wife in my arms, yet, at the same time, it‚Äôs almost unbelievable to think it‚Äôs already been over a year since she‚Äôs been gone.  
\-It‚Äôs trying, but never truly succeeding, to accept the unacceptable. She was such a good person, with so much more to give. There is no sense in her untimely departure.  
\-It‚Äôs knowing that you probably still have decades to live without the person you hoped to grow old with.  
\-It‚Äôs grieving not just the loss of the person, but the loss of all the plans, the dreams, the future you imagined together.

It‚Äôs a brutal awakening to the fragility of life. We had everything we needed to be happy, and we were. Then illness came and abruptly took that happiness away. In our thirties, life shouldn‚Äôt be over‚Äîit should be just the beginning of our journey together. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs possible to truly recover from such a loss. One can only learn to live with the absence, to find a way to move forward despite the weight of it (easier said than done). I know my wife wouldn‚Äôt want me, or anyone who loved her, to remain mired in pain. I‚Äôm sure she would want us to continue living, to keep embracing life as she did‚Äîfully and without hesitation‚Äîeven though, for now, that feels impossible.

I've been here for a year and a half and have very much enjoyed working where I am. About 6 months ago we got a new postdoc who was super impressive on paper, but was not super personable and had some red flags interacting with others. Our PI did not run hiring him by us, which was quite unusual. Turns out, as suspected, he is a bully. I talked to folks in his department at his last school, it's a pattern. He screams at grad students, is nasty to other postdocs about their publication record, bullies shared resource lab staff, tries to circumvent institution policies, monopolizes my time (which has kept me from doing independent research), undermines me at every chance, and even disregards regulatory rules. In other words, he makes my life hell. My PI really likes him because of the quality of his work and the fact that he tells my boss EVERYTHING going on in the lab. I am talking the length of other postdocs coffee breaks, the printer being out of ink, whose cells are contaminated, etc.  I managed to make it through because my other coworkers and I lived close to my support system.

Our lab moved schools about 4 months ago and, in that process, many grad students and postdocs have moved on. I moved because my boss is great and, in general, has kept a positive lab environment, save this guy. Now, 4 months in,  it's just me, him, our PI and a few scattered co-advisees in a new town. He has gotten much worse, since I am the only person consistently in lab to direct his aggression towards. He sends me messages 20ish times a day, and often points out what I've done wrong that week at 5:00 pm. He is hellbent on making me look incompetent to my boss. He's a terrible communicator, and compensates with constant, angry communication.

The combination of the hostile work environment and loneliness is starting to actually cause me to mess up. I've been working on it with the employee assistance program, but they aren't super helpful at resolving the issue.  I sent my boss receipts of the messages which crossed the line and it resolved pretty quickly without needing to have a ""talk."" After a month, the postdoc is back on his bullshit.  I am in a Sartre-style hell with a guy who needs a personality transplant and seems to want me fired after moving 2000 miles from home. How do I deal with this dude?

**The Brofist Before the Storm**



The sun beat down on the cobblestone streets of a small, picturesque town nestled in the heart of Sweden. Felix, a lanky teenager with unruly brown hair and a mischievous glint in his eyes, grinned as he weaved through the bustling marketplace. He was Felix Kjellberg then, a name whispered amongst the local kids for his uncanny knack for making them laugh, his hilariously awkward attempts at skateboarding, and his infectious enthusiasm for anything remotely quirky.

Life was simple. It was a symphony of carefree days spent skateboarding with friends, exploring the dense forests surrounding his hometown, and indulging in the simple joys of youth. His biggest worries involved perfecting his next goofy impression or figuring out the intricate strategy for the latest video game release. He dreamt of creating something, something that resonated with people, something that brought a smile to their faces in the same way his antics did to his friends.

One sun-drenched afternoon, his life took an unexpected turn. He stumbled upon a quaint little caf√©, the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and cinnamon rolls wafting out, beckoning him inside. There, amidst the warm, comforting interior, sat a girl. Marzia. She was reading a book, her dark hair cascading down her shoulders, a gentle smile playing on her lips. Felix, never one to shy away from a challenge‚Äîor a beautiful girl‚Äîapproached hesitantly. His usual wit seemed to abandon him, replaced by a nervous stammer. Somehow, he managed to introduce himself and, to his surprise, she responded with a warm, genuine smile.

Their first conversation was a hodgepodge of awkward giggles and clumsy attempts at flirting. They talked about everything and nothing‚Äîhis love for video games, her passion for art, their shared wonder at the world around them. It was the beginning of a friendship, a connection that blossomed into something deeper with each passing day. Marzia ignited a spark in Felix he never knew existed, a desire to be better, to create something that reflected the joy she brought to his life.

Driven by this newfound inspiration, Felix started making videos. They were raw, unpolished, and often utterly ridiculous. He was simply being himself, the fun-loving, slightly awkward teenager with a passion for sharing his goofy experiences. His genuine enthusiasm was contagious, and slowly, his audience grew. The brofists started appearing, the comments flooded with laughter and encouragement. He found a purpose, a way to share his unique perspective with the world, all thanks to Marzia, who became his steadfast supporter, his guiding light.

As Felix's channel grew, so did the challenges. He faced doubters, trolls who aimed to diminish his efforts, and the pressure to maintain relevance in a rapidly changing digital landscape. Yet, he persevered, fueled by his unwavering passion and the constant encouragement from Marzia. He fought his way through the online jungle, learning and evolving with every new challenge.

But life wasn't always sunshine and laughter. There were twists and turns, unexpected setbacks that threatened to derail his dreams. He faced betrayals from those he thought were friends and dealt with the darker side of fame. The pressure to always be on, always be entertaining, weighed heavily on him. There were moments he thought of quitting, of walking away from it all. But Marzia was always there, her unwavering belief in him giving him the strength to continue.

Felix pushed himself harder than ever before, fueled by a desperate need to protect everything he had built, everything he held dear. The constant pressure, the relentless competition, took its toll. He found himself battling not only other players but also the very demons within himself‚Äîthe anxieties, the fears that threatened to consume him. His channel, once a hobby, had become his entire world, a world he was determined to defend at all costs.

Felix's eyes fluttered open. The harsh fluorescent lights of an infirmary were a stark contrast to the sun-drenched streets of his memory. He felt a throbbing pain in his head, a dull ache that mirrored the turmoil in his heart.

Marzia was there, her concerned face hovering over him, a genuine worry etching its way onto her features. She reached for her phone, and with a gentle smile, he saw her subscribe to his channel. The familiar red notification popped up, a tiny beacon in the sterile, cold room.

A surge of unfamiliar power coursed through his veins. It wasn't just adrenaline, not just relief. It was a resolute determination, a newfound fire that had been kindled. He felt it, acutely, a spark of defiance sparked by the simple act of her support.

""I'll succeed,"" he whispered, his voice raspy, but resolute. ""I'll make it, and I'll show them all.""

The brofist, once a playful emblem of his online identity, now roared with the force of a battle cry. It was a promise of victory fueled by a simple, genuine passion for the community and a fierce resolve to conquer any obstacle. The carefree teenager of old was a distant memory, replaced by a determined warrior, ready to reclaim his rightful position and reshape the landscape of online entertainment.

I have DF64 with SSP MP that I use for pourover/espresso. For pourover everything is fine, I love the taste profile for the coffees I drink. But changing between espresso and pourover all the time on DF64 is a bit of a chore (to avoid retention) so I wanted to purchase hand grinder just for pourover with a similar taste profile to SSP MP or a complementary one to SSP if I switch back to pourover on DF.

Two obvious choices are Pietro and ZP6. Which one would you say is the correct choice here?

From what I see from search if I want to upgrade the clarity (and separation) the choice would be Pietro but it shines in washed coffees while ZP6 would be a bit better when it comes to anaerobic ones? Am I correct to assume that?",2,1731337793.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

1goubfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1goubfx/binge_drinking_day_7_post/,Binge drinking - day 7 post,"I meant to write up here Saturday/Sunday but I just felt like I didn't have the time, and I lost the motivation to write. We ended up having a pretty busy weekend, but it was fun. The good news is, I made it Friday without a drink and only 4 Sat/Sun (each). I don't know if it's okay to say that here. But I did have a few drinks and I did not spiral down a binge-drinking episode. I didn't need to rely on my wife either to stop me. It really felt like a mantra in my head, ""I will not binge drink. I will not wake up tomorrow feeling like a dumpster."" In retrospect, I do wish I had taken the 10-15 minutes Sat/Sun to do some writing. Over the last week it has really helped keep me focus on my goals, and set a tone for the day. I'm going to continue to write every day, but I think I will take it off from the world of Reddit.

I think my ability to stay binge-free this weekend was due to a few factors.

  
\>The recency of my last binging, only a week ago. This is still relatively fresh in my head, and it's easier for me to remember how shitty I felt. 

\> Staying focused all week on my goals via writing. I need to keep doing this

\> Doing my best to keep my stress-levels low, especially on Friday. I feel like I try to get so much done on Friday so my weekend can remain open/free. This is great, but unfortunately sometimes it feels like, hey I worked so hard to get everything done today so I can enjoy the weekend. And sometimes, ""enjoy"" it too much.

\>Having 0 real plans with other people this weekend. Sometimes after hanging out with friends/family all day I often feel like I need to stay up and have another drink just to unwind. And that's usually where I can spiral. Realistically, I don't think there is much I can do to control this. I'm not going to just stop spending time with those close to us, but I need to find a way to destress afterwards. Maybe a cup of decaf coffee or a slice of cake idk lol. This is something I need to spend more time thinking about.  

  
Going forward, I know I can at least make an impact with some of these bullets. And although the recency of my last episode continues to fade, I become stronger when I string more and more binge-free weekends together. This upcoming weekend I'm doing some part time work Sat and Sun which should keep me busy, and I don't drink when I'm responsible for this type of part-time work. So I'm very confident I will actual abstain completely from alcohol the next \~2 weeks or so.

  
Thanks to this sub-reddit for being so kind and their support. I'm wishing everyone else here the best of luck.

Checking back, she found everyone all over the place. Sure, the ride was rough, but it could have been worse.¬†

Keith wasn‚Äôt at all pleased. ‚ÄúMadelyn! You never drive a wagon recklessly like that again, do you understand me?‚Äù

At first, her ears drooped. She didn‚Äôt like being scolded by him. However, she only did what she had to do. Offended, her ears pointed forward as if they were her daggers. She threw the reins down.¬†

‚ÄúI just saved everyone‚Äôs life,‚Äù she argued. ‚ÄúCan you stop being Ambassador General momentarily and appreciate that I didn‚Äôt want you captured?‚Äù¬†

He responded, ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù she added, correcting herself.

Natani scolded him in turn. ‚ÄúKeith. Lay off, will you?‚Äù¬†

He flinched. After a pause, Keith crawled over and sat next to her. They sat silently while everyone else collected themselves.¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to be harsh. I‚Äôm grateful you got us out of there. I really am. I‚Äôm just worried about you, that‚Äôs all. You‚Äôre not just my escort, Madelyn. You‚Äôre the king‚Äôs daughter. If something happened to you‚Ä¶‚Äù

When she looked at him, she saw his sincerity and appreciated it.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôve been disobeying your orders, sir.‚Äù¬†

He smiled, touching her shoulder. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt easy, I‚Äôm sure. I couldn‚Äôt ask for anyone better to be watching my back. Sometimes, that means making tough decisions. I think you‚Äôre meant for something bigger than this bodyguard stuff, Madelyn.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMaddie,‚Äù she blushed. ‚ÄúPlease call me Maddie, sir.‚Äù¬†

¬†‚ÄúJust Keith will do, Maddie.‚Äù¬†

They shared a smile. She watched him climb into the back to check on everyone. When Natani tried to get up, he recoiled from his wounds and collapsed. The arrows weren‚Äôt all he had suffered. The back of his green jacket was burned through. There was blood.¬†

Keith asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all this?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù he responded. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just keep going.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Keith insisted. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going anywhere until I‚Äôve looked at you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI second that,‚Äù Lynn added, fixing his hat and adjusting his glasses. ‚ÄúI advise we make camp nearby. This forest will provide all the means we need and cover from the enemy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpoken like a true advisor,‚Äù Aster commended while cradling Vehra. ‚ÄúI think we could all use a break.‚Äù¬†

That night, they made camp surrounded by dense brush. Although they had a fire going, it was kept small. Lynn pushed the embers around. They couldn‚Äôt be too careful, or they might draw some unwanted attention. Maddie assisted Keith with tending to Natani. After much grumbling, they managed to talk him into taking his jacket off. Once off, they found the charred remains of his chest bindings.¬†

Maddie asked, ‚ÄúI thought you didn‚Äôt need those anymore?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOld habit,‚Äù he shrugged as Keith carefully ripped them off. ‚ÄúThere are many things I haven‚Äôt gotten used to yet. To tell you the truth, I haven‚Äôt been going to the bathroom because--‚Äù¬†

Maddie gasped at what they found underneath.

There were burns. Natani flinched when Keith touched the wounds. Maddie remembered he got those when he shielded them from the templars. He couldn‚Äôt stop himself from getting hurt despite using dragon wings as a shield.¬†

‚ÄúI have to do something about this,‚Äù Keith said.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm worried. These could get infected, and I‚Äôm not going to let you try and tough it out--‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI said don‚Äôt worry! Haven‚Äôt you noticed I‚Äôve stopped limping since we left the manor?‚Äù¬†

Come to think of it, he had. Lifting his previously injured foot, Natani revealed it to be fully healed. Maddie blushed when he wiggled his toes and forced herself to look away. Keith had much more fortitude to look it over, dumbfounded.

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDragon magic,‚Äù Natani winked.¬†

Keith slumped and remarked flatly, ‚ÄúAm I going to have to hear that excuse every time something doesn‚Äôt make sense?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhatever annoys you,‚Äù Natani teased before touching his back wounds. ‚ÄúSeriously, don‚Äôt worry about these. They‚Äôll heal themselves.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care,‚Äù Keith responded, taking out some bandages. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wrapping you up.‚Äù¬†

¬†‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need--‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúPlease, Nat. I want to.‚Äù¬†

They stared at each other as something profound came between them. Maddie could see it as her eyes darted back and forth. Whatever was going on, they were struggling to hold it back. She thought they were going to pounce on each other.¬†

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Natani sighed. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt wrap me up like a mummy, ya dork.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúKeep it up, and I will,‚Äù he teased.

There was too much tension between them for Maddie to handle. She left them alone while walking around the campfire to check on Aster. She couldn‚Äôt help but think about them, though. They were growing closer, leaving her to wonder what that would mean for Keith and Alaric and how much blame would rest on her if things got even more complicated.¬†

As for Aster, he had Vehra covered in his cape. He stood vigil over her like a soldier guarding his king. He reminded Maddie of the honorable man he used to be. She didn‚Äôt like how he treated Keith and Alaric, though. She was taught to be open-minded by her mother. As strange as an open mind was in their empire, she told her it was essential to be tolerant of others, even the intolerant who made up most of their home‚Äîher time undercover in the West certainly helped, especially when she made friends with a certain Westerner.¬†

Maddie missed her special friend dearly.

Aster didn‚Äôt look at her when she joined them. He kept still and at attention. He looked funny and could pass as a very severe and grim statue who could take his place amongst the many busts and figures in the royal halls.

Maddie whispered, ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúI took my eyes off her once and thought I lost her forever,‚Äù he responded sadly. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt ever do that again.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt your fault, everything that‚Äôs happened to her. I don‚Äôt know her, but I know you care a lot about her, right?‚Äù

Aster gave the slightest nod.

‚ÄúShe must have cared a lot about you. Don‚Äôt you think she‚Äôd want you to relax just a little now?‚Äù

After a pause, he sighed and did just that. Stretching, his back cracked in several places, and he sat down. Maddie remained standing.

‚ÄúSo what now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat now is we fix her and whatever is wrong with her,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúWhatever is making her like this, we‚Äôll find a cure.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd if we don‚Äôt?‚Äù

Only then did he look at her. Aster appeared worried, causing her to regret asking him. She never knew him to be shaken by many things, but Vehra made him unusually vulnerable. She almost didn‚Äôt like seeing Aster this way.

‚ÄúIf we can‚Äôt, I will still bring her home and look after her. She doesn‚Äôt have any family left, anyway.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you said--‚Äù

‚ÄúI told the runt she did when I thought it would help convince him to rescue her. He only came back to the empire recently. Her parents are dead.‚Äù

Maddie felt bad for Vehra. What little she learned about her was tragic, comparable to what Keith had gone through. Unfortunately, unlike him, she might not have a happy ending.¬†

She needed to know, ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not important now,‚Äù he avoided the subject. He reached in and pushed the hair off Vehra‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring her to live at my mother‚Äôs, where she won‚Äôt be bothered by a world that has long forsaken her. She‚Äôll be happy there where she can have a quiet and simple life. If that means giving up on reclaiming my honor, so be it. I will devote the rest of my life to caring for her.‚Äù¬†

Maddie smiled, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very noble of you, Aster, and it would be the most honorable thing you could ever do.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù

She shrugged, ‚ÄúYeah. I mean, aside from making nice with the General‚Äôs Master and Ambassador. You do owe them an apology and all, but‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

Aster gave her the stink eye.¬†

‚Äú‚Ä¶But maybe you ought to stick to caregiving for the moment. You should only kiss and make up when you‚Äôre ready.

He was taken aback.¬†

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Maddie said, stumbling over her words. ‚ÄúEr, I meant you should make out. Um‚Ä¶I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù¬†

She couldn‚Äôt have walked any faster. Finding Lynn at the fire, she sat beside him and blushed.¬†

He remarked, ‚ÄúWell said, Princess.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù¬†

She didn‚Äôt correct him over calling her a princess, though. He was the only one who could get away with that. After getting to know him better, Maddie understood that formality was all he had. More so than any other Basitin, duty was all he had to live for, having been conditioned for the role of messenger since he was a child when they cut his parts out root and stem, a horrible and archaic practice that her mother outlawed, against the advice of her Generals. Lynn was the last to endure such a gruesome procedure. Yet, somehow, he was always upbeat and rarely lost his smile. Sometimes, Maddie wondered if it was an act.

‚ÄúLynn? I‚Äôd like to think that we‚Äôre friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? You consider us friends, do you? That‚Äôs very nice of you to say.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, I think we‚Äôve been around each other long enough that we can confide in one another.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am an advisor,‚Äù he perked up.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need you to be an advisor. I just want you to be my friend right now.‚Äù

Lynn‚Äôs smile dropped slightly before asking, ‚ÄúIs there something troubling you, Princess?‚Äù

‚ÄúKeith gave me too much credit today. Disobeying him wasn‚Äôt a tough call when we were ordered to, anyway.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe Grand Duke has leadership qualities I seldom see,‚Äù he replied quietly so Keith wouldn‚Äôt hear them. ‚ÄúEven Aster followed his command. Your father planned everything out in advance of our rescue mission. He even managed to figure Master Natani into it without having met him yet. Daman counted on him being a wild card. Tacticians like him are hard to come by. That‚Äôs amongst many qualities I‚Äôm sure your mother saw in him. I‚Äôm sure the first thing she noticed was just how handsome a fellow he is, though‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs all that great,‚Äù she rolled her eyes.

¬†‚ÄúYou‚Äôre worried about him,‚Äù Lynn responded without missing a beat.¬†

‚ÄúI never said that.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúHe had your mother‚Äôs trust and has cared for himself all these years. We‚Äôll see him again.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Maddie grumbled. ‚ÄúI owe him a punch in the face for taking too long on this stupid mission of his. I mean, not that I care or anything, but he left Mom to do all the hard work.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúShe is the best king our country has ever had,‚Äù Lynn declared.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs also the best mom ever.‚Äù

Maddie missed her. Remembering her father telling them to keep his presence secret, she resented him. Daman only decided now to come back into her life like it was no big deal. Worse yet, he ordered her around like some common soldier. It compelled her to write a letter to her mother about meeting him. Despite her instincts telling her not to disobey an order, she had already gotten halfway through it. This was bigger than just following orders.¬†

It was family.¬†

After taking out the letter, Maddie stopped herself from writing anything more. She decided to hold off until later. It had been a long day, and she needed to relax. When the fire cracked, she watched as embers floated up like fireflies. Her attention was drawn to three sets of eyes spying on them from a distant tree. Alarmed, she stood up. Whoever they were, they disappeared after being spotted.¬†

‚ÄúLynn?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs those three troublesome humans we ran into after making port in Edinmire,‚Äù he answered without a care. ‚ÄúThe adrakist was their leader, and there was that blue-haired girl who had such kind words to say to me, remember?‚Äù

Maddie hadn‚Äôt forgotten that fiasco that caused their first diplomatic incident or her first glimpse of human breasts. Remembering how neat they were, she grew flustered.

‚ÄúI enjoyed her company,‚Äù Lynn recalled. ‚ÄúIt might have been short, but I thought she was quite pleasant. You‚Äôre supposed to say this when you grow fond of someone, right, Madelyn?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúYou should tell her that the next time you see her.‚Äù¬†

She could have sworn he was giddy at the prospect. Maddie held her chuckle in, finding him adorable. She had seen plenty of peculiar things, but this was a first and beautiful. She once overheard Lynn confiding to her mother that despite his procedure, he never felt romantic feelings for others and didn‚Äôt care much about the idea of attraction. It wouldn‚Äôt have mattered if he hadn‚Äôt gone through with it. Still, whatever he felt for that weird magician girl suited him.

As for Maddie, she suddenly remembered the third member of that mercenary group, the one who nearly took her head off with her bare hands over a cup of mud water. She could feel her glaring down from somewhere in the trees and immediately shrank behind Lynn.¬†

1gou4gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1gou4gs/i_created_a_new_type_of_baking_scale_am_i_insane/,I created a new type of baking scale. Am I insane?‚Ä¶ Would you use it?,"Looking for a sanity check here. I designed a new type of smart scale and I‚Äôm looking for feedback and thoughts here. Am I crazy? Would YOU use this?

**>> I‚Äôm NOT linking to it. This is a sanity check, a call for help‚Ä¶ lol. <<**

I originally designed it to be a super high end coffee scale but then went overboard and added other features like baking but, maybe bakers don‚Äôt even want what I‚Äôve made.. So I‚Äôm asking‚Ä¶

**A short summary.**

It‚Äôs a smart scale with an app. The app is like a recipe app, but more advanced in it‚Äôs features and also integrated with the scale allowing for so much more than you could ever do with just a recipe app and a standalone scale separate from each other. I‚Äôm a programmer and all the recipe apps I looked at seemed pretty basic, and pretty clunky, so I made a better one.

You can create, modify or import recipes from websites (typical so far). But because it‚Äôs integrated with a scale, instead of just barfing out all the steps and ingredients on one page, Recipes are then broken out into STEPS in the app (you flick through). Step 1: add 1 cup flour. Step 2: add 1 egg. Etc (you can also tap the scale to advance steps and not get your phone or tablet dirty)

**Now the important part**

You do **NOT** hit tare. Each time you measure anything within a recipe step, the weight is stored IN **THAT** step. This allows you to go forward or back through steps and modify if needed. Why? Say you add too much, mistakes happen. You can ask the app to recalculate and it will adjust all other future or previous steps. (ie, I added 12% too much on step 5. Darn. app can add 12% extra to all previous steps and I can go back and add a bit more to each of them. Or just ignore and move on). This also ties into easy portion adjustment etc.

As far as unit conversions go, densities are accounted for. IE 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water clearly do not weigh the same. If you import a recipe it will adjust and account for this and allow the scale to do it's magic.

I‚Äôve built and programmed all this, **it‚Äôs real, it works..** But I feel like I should have asked this BEFORE I created it. My wife loves it.. But, will anyone else? It‚Äôs hard to know nowadays because running ads and marketing is so expensive. Showing someone a product is actually much harder than making the product‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not a large company, I‚Äôm just a guy that made something, I can‚Äôt run $100k worth of ads to find out if people like it.

I get it, some people love measuring cups..  I‚Äôm seeing if anyone here uses scales, would ever consider using a scale if you don‚Äôt currently. Do these features sound interesting?

1gou34g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1gou34g/took_the_sweetest_revenge/,Took the sweetest revenge ,"So my neighbor let's call him Mike, who lives in the apartment across the hall, started to really test my patience. At first, it was just little things, you know, like taking up two parking spots or his dog ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù using my doormat as its personal bathroom. Annoying, but I figured, whatever. I could deal with it. (I think he lived alone and I was new in the neighborhood so I assumed that he was just this grumpy old man)

Then I started noticing my packages going missing. Not just any packages either‚Äîevery single one of my good deliveries: the monthly coffee subscription, my favorite expensive tea, a skincare order. I checked the tracking and it always said ""delivered."" I asked Mike if he‚Äôd seen anything. He gives me this little smirk and says, ‚ÄúNope, strange how stuff just disappears around here, huh?‚Äù And that was it, I knew it was him. The guy looked way too pleased, like he‚Äôd just won the lottery.

So I decided, fine, two can play this game. I ordered a tiny camera online, stuck it up near my door in a little corner, and waited. The very next package delivery, I get a notification from the camera, and guess who‚Äôs helping himself to my box? Mike, walking off with it tucked under his arm like he owned the place. He didn‚Äôt even check to see if anyone was watching. He had that much nerve.

Now I was mad but also‚Ä¶ inspired. So I set up my little plan. I ordered the perfect package for Mike, a nice small box that looked totally legit but with a twist. Inside, I filled it with the nastiest stuff I could think of: I added a glitter bomb, extra-fine glitter, too‚Äîthe stuff that sticks for weeks. And as a little bonus, I got some fish oil capsules, punctured them, and let them sit in the box overnight. By morning, that box was so ripe it made my eyes water just packing it up.

I left it out on my porch, marked it ‚Äúfragile‚Äù to make it look extra tempting, and waited. It didn‚Äôt take more than an hour before I saw Mike on my camera, snatching up the package and strutting back to his apartment with that smug grin.

Then, the waiting game began. For the first couple of days, I didn‚Äôt see him at all. No sign of him in the hallway, no little remarks about my ‚Äúmissing‚Äù deliveries. I figured he was probably scrubbing glitter off his floors and trying to get the fish smell out of his apartment. When he did finally show his face, he looked exhausted, kind of pale, and just‚Ä¶ defeated. The best part was, he still didn‚Äôt say a word to me about the package. He couldn‚Äôt admit to it, which made it even sweeter.

For the next few weeks, my packages showed up right on time, no issues. And Mike? Let‚Äôs just say he kept his distance after that. Funny enough, he moved out a couple of months later, and I like to think the lingering scent and a few stray specks of glitter might have been the final push. Although I still don't know what he did with my skincare products.

The **Stardew Valley 1.6 update** is here, and it's not just any old patch ‚Äì it's a cornucopia of fresh content that'll have you returning to Pelican Town faster than you can say ""iridium sprinkler."" check this out before the news spreads like wildfire!

I've been tilling these digital fields since the game first sprouted, and let me tell you, this update is like finding a prismatic shard in your first geode. The moment I booted up 1.6, I was transported back to that magical feeling of my first spring in Stardew. New end-game content has me staying up later than Pam at the Stardrop Saloon, and the added festivals? They're fresher than Pierre's produce on a Sunday morning.

But wait, there's more! (And no, I'm not channeling my inner Lewis here.) The update introduces eight player co-op, which means I can finally convince my entire friend group to abandon their real-life responsibilities and join me in agricultural bliss. We spent hours last night exploring the new content, laughing over voice chat as we discovered new fish and items. It felt like we were pioneers in a familiar land, each discovery more exciting than the last.

The attention to detail in this update is astounding. New dialogue snippets make the villagers feel even more alive, and I swear I caught Abigail eyeing my new crops with more interest than usual. And don't even get me started on the quality-of-life improvements ‚Äì they're smoother than Harvey's jazz collection.

If you've ever felt the pull of Stardew Valley, now's the time to answer its call.

When we moved here I sold my car because I had to move both of our cars every week due to street sweeping. We kept her car because mine was manual and she couldn‚Äôt drive it, so we decided her‚Äôs was the better option.

Since we started dating (over 2 years now), I‚Äôve been the one to drive us everywhere, so now that I sold my car, I‚Äôm typically the one driving hers around. Whenever we get a parking ticket or maintenance has to be done, I‚Äôm the one who takes care of it.

Now to get to the issue: her school is a 10 minute walk from our apartment, so most days she wakes up 30 minutes before she has to leave, and walks there. Today, I woke up and made her breakfast to go, but she asked me if I would take her to school so she could eat in the car. I told her I really didn‚Äôt want to move the car since around the holidays our street is packed (comm ave for anyone who live in Boston) and finding parking can take 20-30 minutes on street sweeping days. She said it was fine and told me she would be late for class and would eat breakfast here.

For clarification, I made her a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich wrapped in parchment paper and put her coffee in a thermos so that she wouldn‚Äôt be late for class. When she started eating she gave me the cold shoulder and when I asked why, she told me it was ridiculous that I wouldn‚Äôt take her to school over a parking spot. I told her she has never had to worry about parking so she doesn‚Äôt understand why I would prefer her to walk 10 minutes than me to drive 30 to find parking. AITA?

**Edit for clarification: 
- It‚Äôs a sunny 61¬∞ day here in Boston
- She can‚Äôt park on campus because she doesn‚Äôt have a permit to park
- I don‚Äôt need the car, we live 2 minutes from the train station and it can get me anywhere I need to go.
- She wouldn‚Äôt be late if she took the breakfast to go and ate it on the way, that‚Äôs why I wrapped everything up. The only reason she was late was because she stayed behind to eat and argue with me**",199,1731336929.0,AmItheAsshole,177,0.9,False

Kaia smiled as the crisp air kissed her cheeks and her feet crunched through the fresh snow along Landing Street. Grey stone buildings reached up and blocked the low winter sun. Despite the cold, the walk was invigorating. She could have gone in a crawler, but being stuck on the *Sewin Hawk* for so long made her want to stretch her legs.

‚ÄúAfternoon,‚Äù she greeted a pair of shoppers bundled into parkas as they exited M&R Provisions. With a childish grin, she walked inside.¬†

Memories of running down the aisles with her sister and helping her parents stock the shelves flooded back the moment she entered the store. She smiled as she remembered stealing the occasional chocolate bar when her dad wasn‚Äôt looking. The store appeared just as she remembered. Tall shelving, flashy sale holograms, and Old Allan grumbling as he worked on the payment arches.

‚ÄúHey, Allan,‚Äù Kaia called out as she approached.

‚ÄúMadam Kaia! It‚Äôs so good to see you! Master Marinoch is in his office.‚Äù

Kaia grinned. ‚ÄúHow is it you‚Äôre one of the few people who can tell the difference between me and Briya?‚Äù

Her family‚Äôs aged servant shrugged, but Kaia could see his eyes twinkle in delight. ‚ÄúTrade secrets, m‚Äôlady.‚Äù

‚ÄúFine, keep your secrets. Do you know where my mom is?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe stepped out, m‚Äôlady. But your sister is in the back.‚Äù

Kaia laughed. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs how you knew it was me!‚Äù

Allan spread his arms and bowed to hide a smile.

Still chuckling, Kaia left him to his work. She found her sister helping a pair of indentured workers unload a pallet of cereals.¬†

Kaia walked up behind the group and placed her hands on her hips. She lowered her voice to imitate her mother‚Äôs and bellowed out, ‚ÄúWhy on the Great Green Ring are you wasting time? Where is the stacker?‚Äù

One worker‚Äîa pale, thin woman‚Äîjumped, dropping the box she was holding. It broke open and cereal spilled out over the floor.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù the woman stammered in a Lower Shikar Ring accent as she fell to the ground and started scooping it up with her hands.

‚ÄúThe stacker‚Äôs down‚Ä¶‚Äù Briya began, but stopped when she saw who it was. ‚ÄúKaia!‚Äù she shrieked with joy, throwing herself at her twin. Kaia hugged Briya back, soaking in her warmth.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù Briya asked, pulling away with a grin.

‚ÄúWe docked at the orbital transfer station to take on some supplies, so I figured I‚Äôd come down for a visit.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat timing! I got back last week.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs why you were strong-armed into helping around the store. Too much free time.‚Äù Kaia giggled.

‚ÄúYeah, you know Dad‚Ä¶‚Äù Briya rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúAre you at least staying for dinner?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the plan,‚Äù Kaia said. She grew sober and added, ‚ÄúDo you have time to get a coffee? I need some advice.‚Äù

Briya looked back at the pallet and the mess on the ground, then shrugged, a smile spreading across her face as she jumped at the idea to escape. ‚ÄúSure, let‚Äôs get out of here.‚Äù

After giving some directions to the workers, Briya retrieved her parka, and soon she and Kaia were strolling down the street and revisiting old times. They turned off Landing Street and walked down to the scenic promenade. Caf√©s and restaurants lined one side of the street, facing a magnificent view of the snowy peaks of the Gorgan Mountains. At one of the outdoor patios, a group of Zahex pilgrims sipped tea before heading out on the long trail up the mountains to the Sepulchre of the Celestial Veil, the last resting place of Saint Helen. The sight of the pilgrims made Kaia grimace, their thin figures and pale skin unsettling her, as did their lack of colour, contrasting with the usual traits of their race. Once upon a time, these pilgrims relied on her family‚Äôs chain of stores for trip provisions, but that changed with the start of the boycott.

‚ÄúDo you know if Dad has had any luck negotiating with their leaders?‚Äù Kaia asked, nodding at the pilgrims.

Briya shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, they‚Äôve made it some sort of religious edict now.‚Äù

‚ÄúBastards,‚Äù Kaia sighed, feeling just as angry at herself as the Zahex.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù Briya reached out and gripped Kaia‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúNo?‚Äù Kaia sounded snarkier than she intended. ‚ÄúSo someone else alienated the whole fucking race by wanting to exercise her own freedom of choice? Forcing our family‚Äôs business to close multiple locations and almost go into receivership?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess when you put it that way‚Ä¶ it pretty much is your fault.‚Äù Briya grinned.

Kaia glared at her sister, not amused. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo really,‚Äù Briya said more seriously as they entered their favourite caf√©, the Brooding Mare. ‚ÄúYou gotta let this go. We survived. Time to move on.‚Äù

Kaia dropped the subject. Briya didn‚Äôt understand, not really. She didn‚Äôt have to live with the shame of what she‚Äôd done. How was she supposed to have known that leaving her placement at the Zahex Relations Office to join the Navy would have caused such a shit storm? She never asked to be perceived as a heavenly inspired figure by the pilgrims. All she ever wanted was to travel the stars and the Ministry placement kept her planet side, so she had left, and the pilgrims had taken it as her abandoning them.

The women took off their parkas and sat down at a table in the corner, ordered spiced coffee, and reminisced about the last time they were here together. Finally, Briya leaned forward. ‚ÄúSo, what is it you wanted to talk about?‚Äù

Kaia sipped at her drink, enjoying the piquant taste. No one else in the galaxy had quite the same coffee. The local blend was what she missed most about Tophin. With a sigh of pleasure, she put her cup down and told her sister about Admiral Morven and his mysterious offer.

‚ÄúI guess I just wanted to run it by someone,‚Äù she finished.

‚ÄúSounds like an interesting opportunity. Are you going to take it?‚Äù

Kaia closed her eyes. ‚ÄúI dunno. I never aspired to be in anything like the Special Forces. Inferni, I never really even wanted to be in the military. It was just the only way I could get out of that dead end ministry placement. Maybe I should have just followed your path.‚Äù

Growing up, neither of them had been happy living here. They had both wanted to explore the stars. When Briya‚Äôs psychometric tests slotted her in the services stream, putting her on the path to serving on civilian starships, Kaia had been envious.¬†

‚ÄúDo you regret your choice to reject the test results?‚Äù Briya asked.

Kaia looked away, unsure how to answer. Her own psychometric testing had identified a gift for languages that automatically placed her in the political stream. The training was a blast initially, but everything changed when she received her final posting notice. Instead of placing her in the Foreign Service, they assigned her to the Zahex Relations Office here in Saint‚Äôs Harbour, anchoring her to the planet and ending all her dreams of the stars. The only way to break the psychometric contract was to join the military, so Kaia had taken the plunge. Once there, she had discovered a passion for command. Being in control of your own starship as it sailed through the vastness of space had a romantic quality; exploring the far reaches of civilization and rescuing ships in distress. Early in her academy days, she had promised herself that one day that would be her.

‚ÄúIf it means I can‚Äôt get a ship, then yeah. Why should some stupid test we take when we‚Äôre twelve screw everything up?‚Äù Kaia asked with bitterness.

Briya looked around, uncomfortable. She leaned in closer and whispered, ‚ÄúYou know the Emperor Himself created the psychometric hierarchy to pull us from the brink of extinction. You shouldn‚Äôt question His will.‚Äù

Kaia gasped as she realized what she had said. The anger that had been bubbling up within her dropped away, leaving a hollow pit in her stomach. How could she be so stupid? The last thing she needed right now was to incur the Immortal Emperor‚Äôs wrath. Briya was right. The tests were for the greater good. Kaia had even consulted Vicar Indra about her decision to leave her posting at the Ministry. He had directed her to the Scrolls of Binding, which spelled out the fundamentals of the psychometric hierarchy and an obscure passage that allowed her to join the military. That meant the Emperor blessed her change, but everyone else still saw it as breaking the contract. The years of defending her decision, while being called a herator, had soured her against the whole hierarchy. She had not realized how bad it had gotten until now. She closed her eyes and said a quick prayer for forgiveness.¬†

Briya made the symbol of the Holy Ring above her heart and bowed her head, acknowledging the prayer, then she returned her attention to Kaia. ‚ÄúIt seems to me that you have three choices. One, break another contract and end up in servitude. That‚Äôs obviously not a realistic option. Two, you could stay where you are. Sounds like you won‚Äôt get a ship, but at least you‚Äôre an executive officer and still get to travel the stars. Or three, take the plunge and fully commit to the fact that you are a soldier now. Accept Admiral Morven‚Äôs offer, knowing that you‚Äôll see and do violent things, far more than you were initially ready for.‚Äù

Kaia let out a low growl of frustration and sat back in her seat. Why was her need to walk among the stars so strong? She felt bound by an invisible rope that dragged her down a predetermined path. Refusing to let the turmoil at her workplace dampen their time together, Kaia shifted gears, steering the conversation towards a more pleasant subject. ‚ÄúTell me all about your last cruise.‚Äù

Briya gave her a knowing look but didn‚Äôt resist, instead launching into a story about three co-workers and the unlabelled bottles they found behind the bar. Kaia nodded in all the right places, but her distracted mind continued to toy with her options, looking for some sort of compromise.¬†

\*\*\*

The next morning, Kaia woke up knowing what she had to do. She dressed and grabbed a piece of tiger fruit as she hurried out the door to catch Admiral Morven‚Äôs officer before he could check out of the Crossroads Hotel.¬†

The building‚Äôs curved black glass walls and domed roof dominated the city‚Äôs skyline. Inside, she shook off the snow and looked around, unsure what to do next. Gijnat‚ÄôHav was commonly a male Jiuda name, which narrowed her search slightly since there were few Jiuda in Saint‚Äôs Harbour. Her first stop was at reception, but the polite clerk gently explained that she could not disclose her clients‚Äô confidential information. Kaia didn‚Äôt think she looked like a stalker, but she didn‚Äôt press the point. Instead, she went to the bar to search the long way.¬†

Crossroads Hotel was the most expensive hotel in Saint‚Äôs Harbour, and it showed. The building was a cylindrical tube that wrapped around a three-story tree that lived under a glass dome. Kaia moved through the lower level, paying extra attention to the seats that circled the tree base. Seeing no Jiuda, she went upstairs to the restaurant level where several patrons sat eating breakfast. Finally, Kaia spotted a lone Jiuda seated at a table next to the railing that overlooked the tree, eating a breakfast of sausage hash while he scrolled through a holographic terminal. His black cracked scales glittered, and he was almost comically oversized for his artistically crafted spindle chair. He looked up at her approach, his dark red eyes studying her the way a fencer would break down their opponent.¬†

‚ÄúGijnat‚ÄôHav?‚Äù Kaia asked as she came up to the table.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù Gijnat‚ÄôHav whistled in the Jiuda language. He shifted his muscular body around with a casual grace, freeing his legs and hands. He calmly surveyed the room, taking in every detail, and then shifted his gaze towards Kaia. It all made Kaia think *professional killer* with a shiver.

Kaia introduced herself, added, ‚ÄúAdmiral Morven instructed me to give you my decision. I‚Äôm in.‚Äù

Kaia had not expected any kind of delighted congratulations, but Gijnat‚ÄôHav shattered even that low back with a nostril flare of indifference.¬†

‚ÄúDid he leave any instructions or orders with you?‚Äù Kaia asked, perplexed.

The Jiuda hissed annoyance, turned back to his terminal and selected a file, forwarding it to Kaia. When he was done, he returned to his meal as if nothing had happened.

Kaia brought up her Carpi holographic wrist terminal and opened the file. It was a simple text message: *Proceed to Fort Ridge on Guzunov in the Abrore system. Must arrive before 10.550.06.45.*

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it?‚Äù Kaia asked.¬†

The orders, if one could call them that, lacked the Navy‚Äôs standard details. No information about the destination or how to get there. On top of that, it lacked any details about what to expect when she finally reached Guzunov. Gijnat‚ÄôHav‚Äôs only response was another nostril flare. He either didn‚Äôt know or, more likely, didn‚Äôt care. Kaia let out a frustrated huff, then turned and left the Jiuda to eat in peace. Were these sparse orders some kind of test? To see if she could get there on her own? Is this what it‚Äôs going to be like from now on? In that fleeting moment of hesitation, she sensed the familiar tug of destiny beckoning her forward on this unforeseen journey.

Going to keep things as simple and short as i can. I was seeing this guy romantically for over a year, but we never became an official couple. The last week has been an absolute nightmare and i have no clue what to make of any of it.

We've always been close and shared a healthy dynamic with each other, until about a week ago. It was obvious to me that he was burdened with stress in every area of his life, but i still became anxious when his demeanour towards me suddenly changed. He was no longer affectionate and wasn't holding conversations either. I figured i was overthinking so we met for coffee last Monday and i told him my worries. He told me that he thought that 'ideally' we'd be better off as platonic friends. I asked him why, and he said that things felt 'negative'. I asked him to explain, and he couldn't provide any reasoning or examples that pointed towards our dynamic being the problem. I expressed that i felt like our dynamic wasn't the problem, and it seemed to be outside stress that was making things seem worse than what they were, i asked him if he could give the situation time and he agreed. We'd already arranged to go for dinner on the weekend, i asked him if he still wanted to do that and he said yes.

Between monday and friday we didn't talk properly. Friday evening comes around and i call him to find out what the plans are for dinner. He picks up the phone, and we talk for an hour. We talked about our feelings and everything was calm. He kept saying he needed time, and i asked him what that looked like for him. He said i could call him or text him if i wanted to chat, but he wasn't in the headspace to instigate conversations. I asked if he was distancing himself from other people, and he said yes. Suddenly his flatmates invited him to watch a movie, and he said he'd happily call me after the movie finished. Not even 5 minutes after the phone call ended i get a message saying 'i can't do this anymore. I know it's selfish but this is it. I'm sorry'. I was distraught and asked him if he was ending the friendship aswell, and he replied 'friendship won't work. I mean it when i say that this is it'. He later offered to meet up to talk about it in person, but only after one of my friends messaged him (unbeknownst to me) saying i deserved a decent explanation. I told him I'd need that explanation in order to get closure, but I'd have to hear it in my own time. He said okay, and i didn't respond.

The next day he messages again, only saying 'just to be clear, I've made up my mind'. Once again I didn't reply. More than anything it seemed like he was trying to convince himself more than me. But I'm also confused. When i say that nothing happened between us in the lead up to this, nothing happened. There were no arguments, no disagreements. It seems clear to me that he made the decision to end things impulsively. One of my friends made the point that he could've been too afraid to end things over the phone, but that doesn't make sense to me either. If you're planning on cutting someone out of your life, you don't agree to go to dinner, pick up their phone calls, and voluntarily offer to call them back. I wish i could make sense of this. 

I keep getting this sneaking suspicion that he's going to change his mind. He has a tendency of chopping and changing his mind when it comes to most things, but i also know stress can make people impulsive. It's probably worth me mentioning that he's also got an avoidant-attachment style. And before anyone assumes this has something to do with him wanting to see other people, i know it's not. He's a Christian and has no interest in engaging with sexual behaviour as he feels it goes against his personal beliefs, and i know that he doesn't get involved with people because complex emotions tend to freak him out ( he's never been in a relationship in his life, plus he mentioned he was pushing other people away, not just me).

1gotx8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gotx8w/burr_lifespan_replacement_eureka_mignon_facile/,Burr lifespan / Replacement [Eureka Mignon Facile],"I have recently moved from french press / moka to a Gaggia E24. As part of that process I have fallen into the rather deep Reddit rabbit-holes related to coffee, and in that tumble have discovered that it's all (well, significantly) about the grind.



I have for at least 3 years now owned a Eureka MIgnon Facile, which was a nice (big) upgrade from the wee 'blender' grinders I was always using prior. And, happily, it turns out Reddit has revealed to me it is good enough for my current needs as well.



I roast my own beans. Buy 50 lbs at a time (Mexican Chiapas HG), and that 50 lbs lasts about 4 months... so I am grinding roughly 150 lbs of green bean (so +/- 125 of roasted) per year. So: give or take, 350-400 lbs (150-180 kg) to date. Also, I have never screened for stones (had no idea up to a week or so ago that was even a thing.)



At what point do I need to replace the burrs (50mm flat SS) in that machine? Seems to be working OK, but I'm not sufficiently experienced to properly assess that.",3,1731336647.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

We'll be going there in the first week of December and will have 3.5 days to explore Tokyo. We are in our early 30s. Our accommodation is in the heart of Akihabara, very close to the establishments.

Any advice or tips is very helpful.

**Day 1**

* Arrive from Kyoto since our first trip is in Kyoto & Osaka. Probably we'll arrive at 3:00 pm. Check in hotel & rest for an hour.
* Walk a little bit in Akihabara
* Go to Ginza and have dinner there
* Back to hotel

**Day 2**

* Asakusa (Sensoji Temple)
* Ueno Park (optional, if we have extra time)
* Harajuku (have lunch here)
* Explore Takeshita street then rest in a cafe
* The making of Harry Potter (Afternoon @ 2:30 PM)
* Shibuya Sky (Evening)
* Dinner in Shibuya
* Don Quixote (optional, if we still have energy)
* Hotel

**Day 3**

* Akihabara
* Go to Shibuya and have lunch there
* Shibuya crossing & Hachiko (maybe we can do this in the morning as well or in Day 2 before or after Shibuya Sky?)
* For the afternoon, find a coffee shop and rest but I think we have still more time in the afternoon, so is it doable if we include Shinjuku? We really don't have any idea for this day aside from teamlab Borderless.
* teamlab Borderless in the evening
* Go to Roppongi dinner here
* Hotel

**Day 4**

* Disney Sea
* Last minute shopping (any advice where? Don Quixote or in another store?)

If you're planning on cutting someone out of your life, you don't agree to go to dinner, pick up their phone calls, and voluntarily offer to call them back. I wish i could make sense of this. 

I keep getting this sneaking suspicion that he's going to change his mind. He has a tendency of chopping and changing his mind when it comes to most things, but i also know stress can make people impulsive. It's probably worth me mentioning that he's also got an avoidant-attachment style. And before anyone assumes this has something to do with him wanting to see other people, i know it's not. He's a Christian and has no interest in engaging with sexual behaviour as he feels it goes against his personal beliefs, and i know that he doesn't get involved with people because complex emotions tend to freak him out ( he's never been in a relationship in his life, plus he mentioned he was pushing other people away, not just me).

Since my awakening and realization as to who and what I am, a great many emotional ups and downs have occurred, Many many things have come to clarity, many more things to come.  Recently, I have discovered that I am a carrier of the Divine Feminine.  I have met my Masculine, I am torn.  I ask for your advice:

The main thing is, it comes down to a dilemma, and the repercussions of that dilemma:

Option the First:  Do not pursue, despite the callings of my heart, lay it to the side and stick to the mission. The Great Awakening must override all desires.

OR

Option the Second:  Chase after this person whom I have not seen in close to a decade and explain all of the following:

* The 3d World they know is a lie, a beautiful lie, but a lie.
* I am a Starseed, and all of the ramifications of that term.
* Warn them of the swiftly upcoming Global Nervous Breakdown.
* We are twin flames, destined to be together,  despite whatever they currently believe in their 3d existence.
* Ask if they'd like to go for a coffee date, Y'know, just to catch up and compare notes.

If I pursue option the first:  Strong chance we won't get together. I accept that,  Bad side is, there's a chance their soul will be stuck upon the Wheel of Samsara until the end of the next Yuga.  Not a long time from a soul's perception.  Merely 1.73 million years in linear 3d time, give or take a century or two.

If I pursue option the second:  Slim to fair chance they won't go for a second date.

Oh, my fellow Starseeds, I am beside myself with indecision. I walk the streets wringing my hands in a fit of teenage angst.

I beseech you... WHICH OPTION DO I PURSUE?",1,1731336212.0,StarseedHumor,0,1.0,False

I was seeing this guy romantically for over a year, but we never became an official couple. The last week has been an absolute nightmare and i have no clue what to make of any of it.

We've always been close and shared a healthy dynamic with each other, until about a week ago. It was obvious to me that he was burdened with stress in every area of his life, but i still became anxious when his demeanour towards me suddenly changed. He was no longer affectionate and wasn't holding conversations either. I figured i was overthinking so we met for coffee last Monday and i told him my worries. He told me that he thought that 'ideally' we'd be better off as platonic friends. I asked him why, and he said that things felt 'negative'. I asked him to explain, and he couldn't provide any reasoning or examples that pointed towards our dynamic being the problem. I expressed that i felt like our dynamic wasn't the problem, and it seemed to be outside stress that was making things seem worse than what they were, i asked him if he could give the situation time and he agreed. We'd already arranged to go for dinner on the weekend, i asked him if he still wanted to do that and he said yes.

Between monday and friday we didn't talk properly. Friday evening comes around and i call him to find out what the plans are for dinner. He picks up the phone, and we talk for an hour. We talked about our feelings and everything was calm. He kept saying he needed time, and i asked him what that looked like for him. He said i could call him or text him if i wanted to chat, but he wasn't in the headspace to instigate conversations. I asked if he was distancing himself from other people, and he said yes. Suddenly his flatmates invited him to watch a movie, and he said he'd happily call me after the movie finished. Not even 5 minutes after the phone call ended i get a message saying 'i can't do this anymore. I know it's selfish but this is it. I'm sorry'. I was distraught and asked him if he was ending the friendship aswell, and he replied 'friendship won't work. I mean it when i say that this is it'. He later offered to meet up to talk about it in person, but only after one of my friends messaged him (unbeknownst to me) saying i deserved a decent explanation. I told him I'd need that explanation in order to get closure, but I'd have to hear it in my own time. He said okay, and i didn't respond.

The next day he messages again, only saying 'just to be clear, I've made up my mind'. Once again I didn't reply. More than anything it seemed like he was trying to convince himself more than me. But I'm also confused. When i say that nothing happened between us in the lead up to this, nothing happened. There were no arguments, no disagreements. It seems clear to me that he made the decision to end things impulsively. One of my friends made the point that he could've been too afraid to end things over the phone, but that doesn't make sense to me either. If you're planning on cutting someone out of your life, you don't agree to go to dinner, pick up their phone calls, and voluntarily offer to call them back. I wish i could make sense of this.

1gotqbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/diySolar/comments/1gotqbb/solar_powered_camping_questions_and_feedback/,Solar powered camping questions and feedback ,"Just got back from a renissance festival and had a blast but looking to manage my solar system a little better and I had a few questions and ideas that I'm hoping some people can give me a better understanding on. I have a 4s2p system of lifepo4 batteries each 300ah running a renogy 3000 watt inverter. Charge system is renogy rover 30 amp with a 550 watt solar panel. They system is housed in an 8ft emclosed trailer. I did run a hard line from inverter to an outdoor gangbox under tongue of the trailer to run extension cords off of. Mostly use the power to run lights, fans, and a mini fridge for a family of 4 camping and we ran no problems with just us. But decided to use it for a large camping group this weekend.

We camped for a total of 3 days and supplied power for about 7 tents (15 people). First day it ran great but had to much rain to charge leaving us run dry on power for the next day. We did cook dinner in an instapot the first night and ran a coffee maker the next morning and that drain the last of power. Thinking of adding a back up charging supply with a 6500 watt generator (already own) and 30 amp charger running off it. From the research I've done i understand that it should be fine to run both solar and back up charging at same time if I need too. But I think sticking to griddle cooking and running coffee pot while generator runs would cut down on power needs during the day. Leaving the battery system to do the rest during the night. Another thing i came across that I'm think I should upgrade is extension cords. We just threw the extension cords we had in a box and brought them. Ranging from a few 14 gauge to mostly 16 gauge. And ranging in length from a few 10-15 ft to a few 25-50 ft in length. I might be wrong from my understanding but with the voltage loss from the unnecessary length would cause more amps to be drawn to power the equipment. Over all i think with some tweaking and optimization it'd run better but thinking about picking up another set of batteries for a bigger buffer would be nice.",0,1731336120.0,diySolar,0,0.33,False

1gotl1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gotl1p/sector_4/,Sector 4,"Everyone thinks that there is something in their house when they are alone. It's the little creaks, the drips, the small shadows. But nothing is actually there. 

That's what Harry kept telling himself. 

It was his third night alone in the small mining trailer that quietly sat beside the big cactus with the one broken branch. The Arizona wind breathed along the outcroppings and ridges, lightly brushing the dust and making it eddy in little swirls in the moonlight. 
The wind found it's way into the old trailer and lightly moved the claim maps hanging on the brown wall paneling. Harry hated that paneling. It was ugly and smelled like formaldehyde, and it reminded him of his aunt. He sat at the company table in the kitchen, trying to focus on the late paperwork and trying not to think of margaritas and a particular beach on the coast of Cabo. 

The lamp cast shadows across the wall and down the long trailer hallway leading to the equipment room. Harry sighed, punching another equation into the old Casio calculator and listening to the machine buzz and rattle. He shivered. It was too cold. Arizona was supposed to be a warm place. He didn't want to be here; he hated the wind and the cold and the long hours, but he stayed out of dogged determination. ""God hates me,"" he muttered. His last job had been a dead end, just pushing papers and taking orders from Marge, the office queen. When his best friend Bud had called one day talking about a high-paying job on a new mine in Arizona, it had only taken Harry a few moments to decide to quit and head out to the desert. The paychecks were good, and at least Marge was bossing around some other desk jocky at the old office instead of him.
Something creaked in the building and Harry paused, listening. He shook his head, trying to dismiss the fear of the dark that had plagued him since he was a child. That creeping, paralyzing fear that flowed into his body and built horrible visions for him in his bedroom when the door was shut and the lights were off. He swallowed and stood up, both hands on the table. Closing his eyes he breathed deep and listened to the night outside. ""Everything is fine"", he muttered. ""It's only the damned wind.""
Suddenly, from the back of the company trailer, a noise made the hair on the back of his arms stand up. His eyes snapped open, boring into the darkness of the hall. It wasn't a noise like something had stepped into the room, like a creaking board. It was a settling noise, like something very heavy had just been taken off the floor, letting the joists breathe again. The trailer shuddered lightly and then was still. Harry's pulse hammered in his ears. ""Jesus."" He whispered to himself. ""What the hell."" He cursed himself for his cowardice, grabbing his bright yellow mining company flashlight and shining the beam down the hall. The light played across the dusty metal shelves and old coffee cans. He saw nothing. 
Slowly, Harry settled down a little, reaching up and running his hand through his hair. ""Shit job."" He muttered. 

He had just sat down again when he saw something odd. The company had installed a control panel in the trailer almost a month ago, some new safety standard from corporate. It had little lights that tripped when a motion sensor in one of the five main shafts detected movement. Harry was so used to the lights blinking on and off all day that he hadn't noticed until now that the shaft four light had been activated. He stared at it. It was two in the morning, and mining activity had ceased in that sector yesterday afternoon when a link broke in one of the conveyor belts. He felt a lump growing in his throat. Nobody should be in sector four. He had locked the gate personally with one of the big orange padlocks. He forced himself to breath. The trailer creaked again, making him jump. It was loud this time, like big boss John Stern had just walked in. 
Harry's breath drew in ragged down his dry throat as he stood frozen in place, trying to will himself to move. 

He licked his tongue across lips that were dry as sandpaper and clenched his fists. ""Nothing, you idiot. There is nothing in the dark but the dark."" He closed his eyes for a moment, and that's when he heard it. 
From the darkness of the hallway. Like a small, thin, intake of breath. A ghost of a noise, like the sound of air drawn through a soda straw. 
His eyes flew open, and that's when he saw IT. 
Like a part of the shadows had  detached from the pool of darkness and come alive, it slowly swayed on the edge of the room, crouching on thin limbs. Its eyes were fixed on his face, unblinking and narrow, just pinpricks of shimmering white set in a featureless face. A single, long, tapered finger extended into the lamplight and touched the orange shag carpet. It was watching him.

Harry felt a shriek rising in his chest, a primal, terrified scream. His heart, hammering at well over peak rate, was pumping adrenaline into his body and preparing him for the only reasonable course of action. 
He suddenly belted out, ""Oh, fuck this!"" And leaped over the table, scattering papers and shattering the lamp bulb, plunging the room into absolute darkness. Insane fear drove him forward into the door, and the cheap metal slammed open as he bolted through it like an Olympic runner. He didn't even notice the cold night air biting at his arms as he ran toward his truck in the moonlight. His keys were out of his pocket and in his hand even before he had reached his vehicle. Yanking the door open, he vaulted into the old leather seat and slammed the door, punching the locks shut and jamming the key into the ignition. 
The truck roared to life, and Harry switched the lights on high, throwing the truck into drive and spitting gravel in all directions as he fishtailed out of the parking lot. He reached into the glovebox with his right hand, pulling out his Glock 17 loaded with hollow-point bullets, racking the slide back to make sure it was loaded. The weight of the pistol was comforting and he dropped it in the passenger seat, just in case. The truck plowed through a small sagebrush and down a ditch as Harry drove back into the main road, dodging boulders in the dark. He saw the highway up ahead, and felt a little relief. He was almost there. 

Harry never saw the impact that threw his truck twenty feet sideways into the ravine. His world was suddenly turned upside down into a spinning vortex of crunching metal, shattering glass and the smell of oil and gasoline pouring out of the ruptured engine block. The truck sat on two wheels, leaning up against a big rock. Harry stared at what was left of the dash, not understanding. Blood dripped from ruptured knuckles and he could hear a wheezing sound from his left lung. His eye was blurry, and he wiped it with his hand, realizing that it came away sticky. Blood was pouring from a gash in his forehead. He blinked, trying to clear the fog of shock away. He groaned and tried to move, but a stabbing pain in his leg doubled him over and he screamed, grabbing at his thigh. His hand felt something smooth and sharp, and he jolted in horror as he realized he was touching his bone. The truck lights were pointed crazily into the night and a shadow suddenly shifted on the edge of Harry's vision. He clenched his jaw in terror and reached out for his gun. It wasn't there. Harry fumbled desperately in the dark, and he found the polymer grip resting underneath the seat cushion. He snatched it up and pointed the pistol out of the shattered windshield, trembling in fear and shock. Something slammed against the truck again and it rocked crazily. Harry cried out as his head slammed against the steering wheel again. 
Then, it was there, crouched on the hood, buckling the steel sheet under an impossible weight. Harry heard himself scream, a high pitched primal sound of terror. He squeezed the trigger of the Glock, barely seeing what he was shooting at. The gunshots were deafening in the cab of the truck, and Harry's ears only registered a steady ringing as he emptied seventeen nine-millimeter rounds into the hole of his windshield. The slide locked back after the last round left the barrel and Harry dat, dazed, in the scorched smell of cordite and congealing blood. He stared forward, his eyes adjusting to the dark after the flashing gunshots. 
The hood of his truck sat empty. Harry sagged, exhausted, the gun falling empty from his hand. He was spent, leaning against the seatbelt and drawing a short breath. 
The attack was sudden and vicious, and Harry barely flinched as his door was torn away like a piece of tissue paper. The thing snatched him out of his seat, shredding the nylon seatbelts like thin cotton cord. Harry was dimly aware of a spinning sensation as his body flipped through the air like a rag doll, crashing into a sodden pile against the stones and dead wood of the dry creekbed. He lay, his broken leg twisted under his body and one arm bent at an odd angle. He tasted blood and bile in his mouth and he gagged, sucking in quick, ragged gasps of air. He stared out of his one good eye as it approached him on four limbs, like an emaciated ape with a grinning, skeletal face full of needle teeth and long black fingers that seemed to crawl like spiders over the gravel. Harry felt oddly detached, and he briefly wondered if anyone would find him. 
Then, with blackness finally closing in, Harry realized why, all along, he was right to be afraid of the dark.

I just have a single acquaintance here, & someone who seemed like they could potentially be a friend but idk he was probably just doing his job as a bartender & also wanted another client for his tattoo work lmao. After she leaves I‚Äôll have more money for myself that I was fuckin using on her, to buy the gear I had to sell when moving, so I can get back on making music & hopefully play some shows and meet people. Also rejoin a gym. 

Just so you guys can tell me what a fool I‚Äôve been, here‚Äôs some of the shit that happened :)




‚Ä¢While out at a bar, we left at the same time as this random guy and happened to be walking in the same direction. Not even 10 seconds into it she says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my dream man‚Äù to him. He looks at me, and goes ‚Äúno, he is‚Äù to which she replies ‚Äúno you are!‚Äù

‚Ä¢At another bar, we met this group of friends. One of them ended up inviting us to hang out with all them at the tattoo shop he worked at down the street. Shit was going okay we were all just hanging out having a good time, but the one that worked there left to pick up some dranks. She then tells one of the friends ‚Äúyou know, he isn‚Äôt very physically attractive, but his personality makes me wanna have sex with him‚Äù.

‚Ä¢Another time, at a bar she met this other group of friends while I was doing karaoke (lol). After I was done I tried walking up to them but they kind of formed a circle and made it tighter and very visibly excluded me. I said fuck this and walked to our car and accidentally fell asleep. I woke up at like 6am, and after frantically driving to find a coffee shop to ask if they have a charger I could use, I see she‚Äôs at a house not too far away (we share locations). I try going but no one is answering. I go home, an hour or so later she wakes up and tells me she‚Äôs on her way they‚Äôre giving her a ride. She passed out but shit just *did not* feel right. I know it‚Äôs kinda fucked but I looked at her phone, she was messaging the same guy from previous point that night. She‚Äôs telling him she wants to have a threesome with him and his girlfriend ‚Äúso so badly‚Äù, there‚Äôs a few calls back and forth. She *swears* she didn‚Äôt go with him but she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt remember‚Äù whose house she ended up at. 

‚Ä¢She fucked this guy we both knew in school. Embarrassing as fuck because we both knew him in high school but went to different ones, and he had been trying to get in her pants since before we got together and *during* too he kept sending her money on cash app and venmo with the memo asking her to unblock him.

‚Ä¢I overheard her telling our then-roommate that ‚Äúguys with long blonde hair and blue eyes are her weakness‚Äù. She then proceeded to talk about an ex that matched that description, but at that point I just started blasting music cause I didn‚Äôt want to fucking hear it. At the time I just had long hair but I‚Äôm fkn Mexican I have dark hair and brown eyes, that ain‚Äôt me. She‚Äôs also since convinced me to cut my hair now I just look like i could be tapatio guy‚Äôs son, just with tattoos and a labret.

‚Ä¢Was blushing like fucking *crazy* while we were shooting the shit with this bartender (not the one I mentioned above) who looked like this ‚Äúdreamy sk8r boy‚Äù type. He walked away to get what someone else needed, but she then proceeded to ask me how I‚Äôd feel about a threesome within earshot of him.

1gotgfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1gotgfa/spam_this_message_to_bigg_boss_so_that_we_get_an/,Spam this message to Bigg Boss so that we get an entertaining show ,"Six ways of making Bigg Boss Great again (You guys can add more in the comments):

1: Stay Raw to Stay Cool 

It's all about staying and being authentic . Let the players be as they are . Exposing people's game,creating fake love angle and shit is only fodder for insta reels. If they let the contestants be , you will get better content.

2: Getting Reactions Naturally

Based on my previous point, a lot of content shown is mostly fights let's be honest . Everyone likes the kalesh . But the only way you can do it is by giving more tasks. Keep it a balance between physical and mental where they have to speak and also do something sportive or game driven. The reactions would be natural.

3: Bigg Boss should stop intervening 

The reason they started this was because it was a rage in Bigg Boss Tamil. It worked well for them so in the subsequent seasons of bigg Boss, they started doing it in Hindi also . Bigg Boss can be witty at times but don't expose people's game. The feedback of the game should be given only by Salman or maybe you can talk to them seperately in Confession room.

4: Favorites bullshit should be stopped

It was Tejaswini, then went on to Mannara and Munawar and this season we see Vivian and Alice getting that privilege. Even if you don't intend to , it will seek completely scripted. All the talks are surrounding Vivian (be it support or hate) this season. Let it be organic . Give tasks each week to highlight the strength of each contestant every week .  That way , audience can decide who is good and who isn't .

5: The fights over Ration are so boring 

We all are fed up of the Ration fights. Previously with the luxury budget task ,it was better . Now every day it has become fighting for Ration, coffee etc. The show Lockup did really well because the contestants were given food . There was no drama surrounding food. All the drama surrounded was elimination, tasks and cross group enemities. 

6: Bigg Boss Themes suck

The past , present and future is piece of crap. You design the house the way u want. Themes aren't working . Keep it minimal. Last season was 3 houses . That flopped badly too . Don't keep any theme . Let it be neutral and see how things will change . Timeline hilanewala ab kuch nahi hila paa rha hai . Only power he has is immunity so far which the ""Captains"" of other seasons had too.

Bonus : Scrap the Bigg Boss Anthem  

Even ChatGPT can write a better song than the current seasons anthem.  The good old days of waking up to bollywood songs was so much better . Call Bhushan Kumar as one of the housemates lol(he's the owner of T-Series). Copyright issues also won't be there . ",21,1731335389.0,biggboss,10,0.84,False

Went to the doctor and got an EKG and some tests done and it was determined that I had nothing physically wrong with me. I trudged on with the Zyn, not realizing it was probably exacerbating some feelings of stress I already had from work/life. About 2.5 weeks ago  had another mild panic attack, though this one I was able to recognize what it was. Since then, I‚Äôve been a bit on edge and slightly anxious. I was actually fine until Thursday, when I drank some alcohol and used a lot of Zyn, which led to Friday, Saturday, yesterday, and today being a couple days of anxiety. What I realized is that Zyn is definitely making this issue worse for me. I‚Äôve never had any concerns with mental health/anxiety before this year. Never been a huge coffee drinker, and I drink alcohol but maybe 2x a week. The ONLY thing that changed in my life going into this year was Zyn.

Got together when we were 15. 
Kids are 13,14,15 and are all great. 

We had a few years that we did ok sexually but I feel like there's a lack of drive on her end. I maybe get it once a month and I feel like begging/asking kills the spark/vibe. 

We stay busy with the kid's activities and both work. I'm very outgoing and she is not unless it's a parent of one of the kid's from the school. 

I feel guilty whenever I do something without her (which is rare) because of the tone in comments she makes almost wanting a little random argument. I don't waste energy on arguing about little things but I feel we don't have good communication or much in common. Tried a date night and we had nothing to talk about. She pulled up her phone for Facebook scrolling and I sat there staring trying to feel something.

She doesn't drink at all and I will do a couple beers socially or out to eat at like a Texas Roadhouse for example. 

She doesn't have any friends that she hangs out with. She's a really good person but I can not feel anymore bored. This has been going on for the last decade and I feel like I've held on for the kids and stupidly, other people's judgment of ""High School Sweethearts."" 

I feel like there's a gap with intelligence between us as well and it used to come off as funny/ditzy back in high school. I coordinate the kid's schedules, make the payment for bills from our joint account, and other similar things. I don't know if she could handle things like that on her own. 

I work a lot of hours and never miss activities. With that being said, basic housekeeping (she works from home) falls behind daily to where when I get a free night, I have to clean to not feel disgusted. Coffee, food trash, dishes, clothes all over, switch vehicles and hers is a trash pit, animals that I didn't want going to the bathroom in the basement. It's to the point where I haven't had friends inside my house in 7+ years and the kids can never have a sleepover because I'm worried about rumors of the dirty house getting out. 

Finances, we make about 175-200k a year and can't rub 2 nickles together half the time. I made some money moves and had everything besides the house paid off. She's got a credit card or 2 that always ends up getting maxed out. We took the cash we were saving for ""home upgrades"" only for them to be half assed done. I took out a loan on my 401k for consolidation. Then again, fell into the loan stuff. My credit score dropped from 800s to 500s and I currently get garnished for what's been 5 months + already. If I were to leave, I probably couldn't afford it right now.

I got my order, sat on the table and thought of asking for her number. Then I started wondering whether that was ok, since she was working. I was the only client and she was the only person attending, so nobody would've heard, not the clients and not her boss, so I know I wouldn't get her in trouble or embarress her in front of anyone. And despite that we were still in a super crowded place, in a shopping mall, so I don't think she'd feel threatened or in danger at all. But still, maybe she'd feel pressured in some way. The same way there's a boss-employee power differential, maybe there's also a client-attendant differential too to some extent. And if she wanted to refuse, it's not like she could just leave and she'd know I know where she works, which could be a reason for her to be concerned. In the end I decided I didn't want to make her uncomfortable, so I just paid, I said ""you're very pretty btw"" and I left.

So would it have been bad if I asked for her number? Was it bad that I gave her a small compliment? Is there an etiquette to this sort of thing?

Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

1got4ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1got4ch/just_took_our_first_cruise_with_royal_in_over_10/,Just took our first cruise with Royal in over 10 years. We had mixed feelings about Coastal Kitchen. Was our experience an outlier?,"We had a great trip! This was our first time cruising with our kids and the first cruise for my wife and I since our honeymoon over 10 years ago, except for a river cruise in the interim.

A lot has changed on Royal since we had last sailed. We were able to book a 2 bedroom grand suite so that our entire family could be together in a single stateroom. The overall experience was phenomenal, and really enjoyed the thoughtfulness of all the Sky Class amenities. Our disembarkation was brilliant this morning.

The only thing that felt a little bit off was Coastal Kitchen, and I‚Äôm wondering what experience others have had? Is it known to be disorganized and kind of a best-effort, haphazard meal service, or did we just have an atypical experience? We did hibachi dinner at Izumi one night but otherwise did Coastal for breakfast and made advance reservations through our concierge for dinner bother other nights (quick 3-night cruise to test the waters with our young kids).

Certain aspects were great. The host/ma√Ætre d‚Äô was excellent, remembered us, and had the same table available for us at every service. And all the staff, including our waiter, was wonderful and friendly - great with our kids and made us feel welcome. We loved the concept of Coastal Kitchen. The issues came in the service itself.

Every meal had elements of confusion. The kitchen routinely brought out items we had not ordered, despite our waiter reading back the order correctly to us every time. We had to remind our waiter to bring items that were forgotten at multiple meals. Refills of coffee that were requested never came.

The most odd thing was at dinner our final night when I ordered a glass of wine off the wine menu given to us. After 15 minutes of it not coming, I asked about it and was told they didn‚Äôt have it but had Riesling instead if I would like that? I said sure. After 5 minutes, I was told they no longer had it and if I‚Äôd like Moscato instead? I declined the mostaco but accepted a Sauvignon Blanc that was offered next and which finally came as I was finishing my entree.

I‚Äôm not a wine snob. I just found it odd that there was such confusion about what was and wasn‚Äôt available, and why hand out a wine list without a mention or knowledge of certain items being available?

It was not a terrible experience, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt the upscale and polished service that I assumed was on offer. We love the ambience but not sure that access to Coastal Kitchen would be a deciding factor in choosing to book another suite if this is the typical experience. With all that said, is this similar to your experiences there, or did we just experience an outlier?",5,1731334457.0,royalcaribbean,10,0.67,False

I'm John, from the greatest city in the world, Chicago. With a city so big you'd think dating is easy, I wish that was the case. Tired of the dating apps and I've had connections on here before so I figured I'd give it another shot!

I work in a very demanding customer service job, it's not my favorite job but at least it's work. On my downtime on weekdays you can find me binging a double feature of two movies l've never seen before.

I'm a big horror nerd, and I get excited to watch things I've never heard or seen. Currently doing a deep dive into 1970's Italian Horror.

I watch a lot of other stuff too. I basically live on the Tubi app after work. Comedy, action, even some romantic comedies. B movie are also a favorite of mine. I'm literally filled with weird, obscure film recommendations.

420 friendly! I def hit my vape every night after work, it calms me down after a very stressful day. Weekends if I have nothing to do l'll smoke a bit more, but I can def go days without it. Not a deal breaker if that's not your thing!

Outside of watching stuff on weekends I try to stay as active as I can. Summer and fall I love going to the parks out here with my dog, Buddy! He's a 11 year old rescue dog who I got about 4 years ago. He's got my heart and I know you'll love him.

I'm pretty simple! Go out one weekend night a week with friends to shoot some pool and have a few drinks. I tend to visit coffee shops and check out record stores on weekends too. However, I'm also good at being a coach potato on a weekend if it's needed.

I love all kinds of music. Mainly older things like Beatles, Pink Floyd, Nirvana, I could go on and on. I'm definitely a bit of an old soul. 70s and 80s rock, 90s stuff and of course good old emo music from the 2000s

I use to do a lot of comedy in the city. Would write my own sketch shows and produce/be in them. Some of the best times of my life. I'm currently working on a short horror movie script to hopefully film and enter in film fest next year. I'm a creative guy. Guarantee l'd find us the best dates.

I'm looking for my other half at this point. Someone who can push me to be the best version of myself, and someone I can do the same for. Someone who I can laugh with, take trips with and just enjoy the little things.
