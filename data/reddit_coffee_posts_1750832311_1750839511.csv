I‚Äôve been using a Bialetti Venus moka pot (4 tz) for quite a while now - it fits around 17 grams of coffee and I split that between two people. With added milk, it makes roughly 200 ml of quite strong, satisfying coffee per serving.

Now I‚Äôm considering switching to a Ninja espresso machine. I‚Äôve been watching a lot of reviews and test videos on YouTube, and I‚Äôve noticed most people seem to use the¬†double shot basket¬†even when making a drink for just¬†one person.

That got me wondering: for someone like me who usually drinks milk-based coffee (flat white/cappuccino style), is it really necessary to use the double shot filter for one cup? Or would a single shot basket be enough if I‚Äôm planning to add milk anyway?

I‚Äôm trying to avoid overdoing the caffeine while still getting a balanced taste. Would love to hear how others handle this!

""Lily, you must marry that comatose man James in place of my daughter. This is what you owe the Ginger family! You‚Äî""  
  
""I will.""  
  
Lily‚Äôs reply made her foster mother gasp in disbelief. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù  
  
Lily could understand her shock. After all, in this massive capital city, who didn‚Äôt know how madly she was in love with John Jones? She‚Äôd loved him so much she‚Äôd given up her future, her dignity‚Äîeverything.  
  
She had refused her foster mother many times before, all because of John. Her foster mother clearly hadn‚Äôt expected her to actually agree this time‚Äîto marry a total stranger who lay in a vegetative state.  
  
Calm and numb, Lily repeated, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do it.‚Äù  
  
Once it was clear Lily was serious, her foster mother let out a breath of relief before snapping at her again. ‚ÄúOne month from now, the Luke family will register your marriage with their eldest son. They have decided on that day, and it's final. Someone will come to pick you up for the wedding that day. I‚Äôve already accepted the bride price from the Luke family. It‚Äôs what you owe the Ginger family, and I‚Äôm not giving it back. If you dare go back on your word or stir up trouble, I will...‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù Lily cut her off coldly.  
  
‚ÄúThe Luke family is rich. I trust the bride price was generous. You took me in from the orphanage and raised me for sixteen years. Now I‚Äôll take your daughter‚Äôs place and marry into the Luke family. That settles my debt to you and the Ginger family. From now on, we owe each other nothing.‚Äù  
  
With that, she hung up.  
  
Sitting quietly at the dining table, Lily couldn‚Äôt help but reopen the news article she‚Äôd just seen.  
  
It was everywhere‚Äîvideos of John and Elsa Quinn‚Äôs wedding flooded the internet, dominating the trending charts.  
  
In the video, he and Elsa stood hand in hand, surrounded by their friends, vowing to spend their lives together.  
  
The entire internet was offering their blessings, rejoicing that the two had reunited and wishing them a lifetime of happiness.  
  
Everyone except Lily.  
  
Because John was her boyfriend‚Äîthe man she had loved with all her heart.  
  
Four years ago, he‚Äôd been paralyzed in a car accident. The cold-hearted Jones family had abandoned him, and Elsa had gone abroad and married someone else.  
  
Back when Lily was being bullied, he was the one who had pulled her out of it.  
  
She had loved him in secret for so long. On that freezing, snowy night when he had tried to end it all, she brought him home.  
  
She did everything she could to take care of him, to lift him out of the darkness one step at a time.  
  
She‚Äôd heard about a hospital overseas that could help him walk again. To raise the money, she sold her blood, became a punching bag for rich people, ending up with three broken ribs‚Ä¶  
  
She suffered endlessly, but finally, two years ago, she scraped together enough for the surgery.  
  
It was a success. He could walk again. He kissed her and promised he would treat her well for the rest of his life, that he would never let her down.  
  
She had believed that everything they‚Äôd been through was finally behind them, and from then on, it would all be smooth sailing.  
  
She never expected things to fall apart the moment Elsa came back.  
  
Word had it Elsa was gravely ill and only had six months to live. Her last wish was to marry John.  
  
He couldn‚Äôt bear to see the woman he once loved suffer, so the wedding Lily had spent six painstaking months preparing became Elsa‚Äôs.  
  
The wedding dress Lily had sewn with her own hands‚ÄîElsa wore it.  
  
The diamond ring John had custom-ordered for her‚ÄîElsa wore it on her left ring finger.  
  
Through blurred vision, Lily saw a pendant around Elsa‚Äôs neck.  
  
She recognized it instantly.  
  
It was the keepsake her parents had left her.  
  
She had lost it while trying to save John.  
  
He had once told her he found it and would give it to her on her birthday.  
  
But now, just because Elsa had said she liked it‚Ä¶ he gave it to her instead.  
  
Suddenly, Lily realized there was no point in loving someone like John.  
  
She didn‚Äôt call him. Didn‚Äôt beg him to come back.  
  
She simply lit the candle on her birthday cake and stared blankly as it slowly burned down. The whipped cream cake melted into a mess‚Äîjust like her love for John, which had burned to ash overnight, leaving not a trace of warmth.  
  
It was nearly dawn when John finally came home.  
  
When he saw her sitting at the dining table with red eyes, clearly having stayed up all night, his brows furrowed tightly.  
  
‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you gone to bed?‚Äù  
  
Lily ignored his question and said calmly, ‚ÄúJohn, let‚Äôs break up. And tell Elsa to return my parents‚Äô keepsake as soon as possible.‚Äù  
  
John immediately understood‚Äîshe must‚Äôve seen the news about his wedding with Elsa and was feeling jealous.  
  
He didn‚Äôt like it when women got jealous over nothing, but he had never once thought of leaving her. So he softened his voice.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be mad. I didn‚Äôt forget your birthday. This is your gift.‚Äù  
  
He opened a sleek burgundy velvet jewelry box in front of her.  
  
Inside lay a pink diamond necklace.  
  
The exquisite gem shimmered under the light. The centerpiece‚Äîa pink diamond the size of a pigeon‚Äôs egg‚Äîsparkled brilliantly.  
  
It was far more expensive than the pendant her parents had left her. But it wasn‚Äôt what she wanted.  
  
Just like how she no longer wanted him.  
  
John knew better than anyone how deeply Lily loved him, how she couldn‚Äôt live without him.  
  
When she stayed quiet, he thought it meant she was done throwing a fit.  
  
He reached for the necklace, intending to put it on her.  
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want this necklace! I just want my parents‚Äô keepsake!‚Äù  
  
Lily slapped the necklace away and said stubbornly, ‚ÄúThat pendant was left to me by my parents. How could you give it to Elsa? I only want that pendant!‚Äù  
  
*Still throwing a tantrum...*  
  
John‚Äôs patience snapped.  
  
His chiseled face turned cold and hard, like it had been carved from ice, filled with a sharp, suffocating pressure.  
  
‚ÄúElsa really likes that pendant.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so sick‚Äîhow much longer do you think she‚Äôll even get to wear it? Why must you fight over something with someone who's already dying? Lily, when did you become so selfish and heartless?‚Äù        



**Chapter 2 She Bloomed Like a Rose and Entangled Him Without Mercy**



*Selfish. Cold-blooded. Fighting a dying woman over a pendant‚Ä¶*  
  
But that pendant was hers‚Äîleft to her by her parents. What was so wrong about wanting it back?  
  
Did he really expect her to keep sacrificing everything for him after being betrayed so completely? Was she supposed to grovel after being humiliated like that?  
  
*She wasn‚Äôt that pathetic.*  
  
Before she could even say a word, John‚Äôs phone rang shrilly.  
  
It was a call from Elsa.  
  
Her voice was weak and pained. ‚ÄúJohn, I just threw up blood. I feel awful‚Ä¶ Can you come be with me?‚Äù  
  
John paused.  
  
He hadn‚Äôt even managed to calm Lily down yet.  
  
But he figured Lily would never really leave him, and Elsa was already seriously ill. So he made his decision.  
  
‚ÄúElsa, don‚Äôt cry. I‚Äôm on my way.‚Äù  
  
Hearing her choked sobs, he didn‚Äôt bother explaining to Lily anymore. He turned around and left the room without looking back.  
  
As the front door slammed shut, Lily let out a cold laugh and kicked the diamond necklace into a corner.  
  
It had been like this ever since Elsa came back a month ago.  
  
Every time Elsa felt a little uncomfortable or upset, he would drop everything to run to her.  
  
Rain or shine, day or night‚Äîhe was always there for her.  
  
It was like all those sweet whispers he‚Äôd once murmured to Lily, all those promises of eternal love, had been nothing but a dream.  
  
But luckily, it was all about to end.  
  
In one month, she‚Äôd marry James.  
  
Then John could stop worrying about her clinging to him, and go be happy with his precious crush. What a perfect outcome.  
  
Funny thing was‚Äîher wedding day would be on John‚Äôs birthday.  
  
His birthday, her wedding. Two celebrations on the same day. *Poetic, really.*  
  
As far as Lily was concerned, once she broke up with John, he was no longer her boyfriend. She had no reason to stay in his villa.  
  
And it just so happened to be a Sunday. She spent the whole day packing everything she owned.  
  
She sold what she could, tossed the rest.  
  
She‚Äôd contacted the biggest luxury resale company in Capital City. The staff came straight to her door, and her used bags and jewelry sold for a total of twenty million.  
  
She didn‚Äôt transfer a cent to John. She kept it all.  
  
She earned that money. It was hers.  
  
As night fell, Lily shredded the last tie she‚Äôd ever made for John, threw it away, and returned to her room.  
  
She was just about to leave with her suitcase when she noticed the photo on her nightstand.  
  
In the picture, she leaned against John‚Äôs shoulder, smiling brightly. He was gazing down at her with what looked like affection.  
  
John had always hated taking photos.  
  
This one was taken on her birthday last year, after she begged and pestered him nonstop. It was the only photo they had together.  
  
She had treasured it like gold.  
  
As soon as it was printed, she placed it on her nightstand and looked at it every single day. Even on business trips, she would take it with her.  
  
Now, all she felt was mockery.  
  
She smashed the frame against the floor and tossed it in the trash.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
By the time John came home, it was late at night.  
  
He parked in front of the main house and immediately noticed the living room was dark.  
  
The sight made him vaguely uncomfortable.  
  
He often came home late from social events.  
  
But no matter how late it was, Lily would always leave the lights on for him.  
  
That single light in the night had always guided him home. So before Elsa returned, he had never once stayed out all night.  
  
He figured Lily was still sulking.  
  
Knowing her, she was probably curled up on the couch waiting for him to coax her.  
  
‚ÄúLily.‚Äù  
  
He snapped out of his thoughts and walked quickly into the living room, flipping on the lights.  
  
To his surprise, she wasn‚Äôt there.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt dozing on the couch like usual, struggling to keep her eyes open after waiting so long, ready to stumble into the kitchen and make some ginger tea for him.  
  
The living room felt‚Ä¶ emptier.  
  
He couldn‚Äôt quite put his finger on what was missing, but it felt cold.  
  
‚ÄúSir, you‚Äôre back.‚Äù  
  
Hearing him, Mandy rushed out of her room. ‚ÄúDid you drink, sir? I‚Äôll make you some ginger tea.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúNo need.‚Äù  
  
John wasn‚Äôt in the mood. He rushed upstairs and headed straight to Lily‚Äôs room.  
  
She wasn‚Äôt there.  
  
The room itself was empty.  
  
The potted plants by the windowsill were gone. Even her pillows and bedding had vanished.  
  
The space used to be so cozy‚Äîplush toys, crystal bead curtains, whimsical wall stickers‚Ä¶  
  
Now, it was nothing but cold black and white.  
  
The sterile atmosphere irritated him.  
  
He turned around and asked Mandy in a chilling voice, ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Lily?‚Äù  
  
His presence was so cold, it made Mandy shiver.  
  
She drew in a deep breath before answering honestly, ‚ÄúMiss Lily said‚Ä¶ she broke up with you. And that she‚Äôs not coming back.‚Äù  
  
John was stunned into laughter by the nonsense Lily had left behind.  
  
*So she was still throwing a tantrum?*  
  
*Running away from home?*  
  
*She really thought she had guts now, huh?*  
  
‚ÄúMandy, leave.‚Äù  
  
Once she was gone, John dialed his assistant Wayne, face still cold, and ordered him to find out what hotel Lily was staying in.  
  
She had no family in Capital City. In such a rush, she couldn‚Äôt possibly have found a proper place to live.  
  
Running away in anger‚Äîshe could only have gone to a hotel.  
  
Wayne worked fast. It didn‚Äôt take long before he confirmed she was at Capital City First Hotel.  
  
‚ÄúLily, how long are you going to keep this up?‚Äù  
  
John typed the message into the chat app‚Äîbut then he stopped.  
  
And deleted it.  
  
Because he realized the photo frame on the nightstand was gone.  
  
He knew better than anyone how much Lily had treasured that photo.  
  
Even if she was throwing a fit, she must have taken it with her. No way she‚Äôd just walk out for good.  
  
He didn‚Äôt need to message her.  
  
Four years ago, the Ginger family kicked her out. Her biological parents had died when she was six. She‚Äôd had no home since then.  
  
If she didn‚Äôt come back to him‚Äîwhere else could she go?  
  
Since Elsa returned, they‚Äôd argued countless times.  
  
And every single time, she was the one who apologized first.  
  
*This time would be no different. It was only a matter of time.*  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
In the month since Elsa came back, Lily had been plagued by so many negative emotions that she hadn‚Äôt had a good night‚Äôs sleep.  
  
But now that she was free of that cage, she slept like a baby.  
  
Packing up the day before had drained her energy. Her calves were sore and aching‚Äîshe really wanted to stay in bed.  
  
But it was a weekday. She had to go resign from Jones Corp.  
  
All those years with John, she‚Äôd built her life around him.  
  
When he was struggling, she worked herself to the bone to pay for his treatment. After he became successful, she became his personal assistant and cared for him in every detail.  
  
Now that she was done with him, there was no reason to keep that job either.  
  
She wanted to chase her childhood dream‚Äîto become a great voice actress.  
  
‚ÄúLily, my stomach hurts so bad, I can‚Äôt hold it anymore!‚Äù  
  
Lily had just arrived at the secretarial department when the new girl, Yulia Xander, ran up to her in a panic.  
  
Yulia looked absolutely pitiful. ‚ÄúMr. John needs this file urgently. Can you please bring it to the CEO‚Äôs office for me?‚Äù  
  
She was clearly in crisis mode.  
  
Before Lily could even agree, Yulia had already dashed off toward the restroom in a very awkward pose.  
  
Lily didn‚Äôt want to see John.  
  
But it was obvious Yulia was desperate.  
  
She had a good impression of the girl and didn‚Äôt want her getting chewed out by the boss. So she took the file and headed for the CEO‚Äôs office.  
  
The door was slightly ajar.  
  
Lily raised her hand to knock‚Äîthen froze.  
  
She heard Elsa‚Äôs coy, flirty voice.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, my ankle suddenly hurts so much!‚Äù  
  
Her hand hovered over the door, then lightly pushed it open a crack.  
  
Through the narrow gap, she saw Elsa‚Äôs body suddenly go limp‚Äîand fall into John‚Äôs lap.  
  
‚ÄúElsa‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
John seemed startled and instinctively grabbed her waist, probably afraid she‚Äôd get hurt.  
  
But even after regaining her balance, Elsa didn‚Äôt move.  
  
She hooked her arms around his neck, bright and alluring like a rose in full bloom.  
  
‚ÄúJohn, I suddenly want to kiss you. What should I do?‚Äù  
  
As she spoke, her dewy red lips slowly pressed toward his‚Äî  
  
And John didn‚Äôt move away.       



**Chapter 3 Spiraling, Unraveling, Lost in Her Wake**



""Lily...""  
  
Wayne Hunter had come to the CEO's office to give his report.  
  
Most employees at Jones Corp had no idea about Lily and John‚Äôs relationship.  
  
But Wayne, trusted by John for years, knew everything.  
  
Seeing Lily, he instinctively greeted her‚Äîonly to catch sight of what was happening inside the office.  
  
He froze, horrified.  
  
Then quickly slapped a hand over his mouth.  
  
He looked at Lily, his eyes full of awkwardness and sympathy.  
  
""Elsa, I‚Äôm sorry.""  
  
John had been momentarily distracted, stunned for a good ten seconds before he quickly pulled away from Elsa.  
  
""I'm not blaming you,"" Elsa said coyly, cheeks flushed. ""My shoelace came undone.""  
  
Hearing that, Lily‚Äôs dull gaze dropped to Elsa‚Äôs shoes.  
  
Elsa was stunning.  
  
Bright, bold, beautiful in an almost aggressive way.  
  
Today, she wore crisp designer white sneakers, paired with a white blouse and a pleated pink skirt. Youthful and radiant, she looked exactly like a campus sweetheart.  
  
John didn‚Äôt say anything.  
  
But his actions spoke louder.  
  
He gently lifted Elsa onto the desk, then knelt to tie her shoelace. His movements were so careful, they almost looked reverent.  
  
Watching his long, elegant fingers slowly and intently tie the lace, Lily couldn‚Äôt help but remember something.  
  
Back then, when their love was still new, he had once said to her, *‚Äú*Lily, meeting you is the happiest thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. I‚Äôll protect you, treasure you, never let you suffer. Never betray you.‚Äù  
  
She had believed him with all her heart, like a fool, thinking she was the luckiest girl in the world.  
  
One day, while they were walking hand in hand, they saw a guy bending to tie his girlfriend‚Äôs shoelace. She‚Äôd snuggled into John‚Äôs arms and teased, ‚ÄúWould you tie mine if it came undone?‚Äù  
  
He had answered that it was pointless to compare things like that‚Äîtoo childish.  
  
It was obvious what he meant: no, he wouldn‚Äôt.  
  
John was like a cold, distant mountain capped with snow. She thought his aloofness made sense‚Äîit wasn't in his nature to stoop for something so small.  
  
As long as she had a place in his heart, it was enough.  
  
But now, seeing him so tenderly kneeling for Elsa, Lily finally understood. Love could win anyone over if their love was with the right person.  
  
All his so-called principles, all his ‚Äúcan‚Äôts,‚Äù were never about principle.  
  
*He just didn‚Äôt love her.*  
  
And that was fine. They would both start new lives.  
  
It was fine.  
  
She stood outside the door, quietly watching as he tied Elsa‚Äôs laces, then began to massage her ankle.  
  
Watching the way they looked at each other, the unspoken affection sparking between them...  
  
She watched as the boy she had once loved so deeply blurred into a vague, unfamiliar shadow.  
  
When Elsa threw herself into John‚Äôs arms again, Lily didn‚Äôt linger.  
  
She turned and walked quickly toward the stairwell.  
  
""Ms. Lily!""  
  
Wayne had seen everything Lily had done for John over the years.  
  
The moment she turned to leave, he ran after her, worried.  
  
Normally quick with words, he found himself at a loss. That scene just now had been too damning. He didn‚Äôt know what to say to comfort her.  
  
Pushing his gold-rimmed glasses up his nose, he finally spoke awkwardly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt read into it. Honestly, the boss still really loves you. The last time you two fought, he got drunk and kept calling your name. He‚Äî‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWayne, I‚Äôve already broken up with John.‚Äù  
  
Lily knew Wayne meant well, but she didn‚Äôt let him finish.  
  
Ignoring the shock in his eyes, she continued, ‚ÄúHe loves me? He loves me, so he married Elsa on my birthday? He loves me, so he‚Äôs tangled up with her like that, unable to let go? That kind of love‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want it. Wayne, I‚Äôve already written my resignation. Please sign it when you have a moment.‚Äù  
  
Wayne was the head of the secretary department. Lily didn‚Äôt need John‚Äôs signature to quit‚Äîbut she did need his.  
  
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really sure about this? Does the boss know?‚Äù  
  
Wayne had always been loyal to John.  
  
He didn‚Äôt want John getting back together with Elsa, not after she abandoned him when he was at his lowest.  
  
But after Elsa came back, he saw how John had treated her, and he knew it wasn‚Äôt fair to Lily.  
  
Deep down, Wayne understood‚Äîleaving John might actually be the best thing for her.  
  
That night, John got drunk after arguing with Lily; he hadn‚Äôt just called her name. He‚Äôd insisted she was his wife. When Elsa came in, John had pushed her away.  
  
Wayne knew John felt guilty that Elsa was dying.  
  
But somewhere along the way, he‚Äôd fallen for Lily too.  
  
Still, not wanting to make a move without permission, Wayne decided to speak with John before signing anything.  
  
‚ÄúMs. Lily, you‚Äôre giving this directly to the boss? I‚Äôll bring it to him. I‚Äôll talk to him first. If he agrees, I‚Äôll sign it.‚Äù  
  
Lily had wanted to finalize her resignation as soon as possible.  
  
But she didn‚Äôt want to make things difficult for Wayne. She handed over the file and returned to her office to wait.  
  
Even if John didn‚Äôt approve it, she wouldn‚Äôt be coming in tomorrow.  
  
She liked finishing what she started, but there was no point dragging out something that no longer mattered.  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
That afternoon, after confirming Elsa had left, Wayne went to John‚Äôs office.  
  
As soon as he stepped in, he saw John‚Äôs face was thunderous.  
  
‚ÄúBoss‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWho made this coffee?‚Äù  
  
John glared at the cup on his desk like it had personally offended him.  
  
Wayne instantly understood what was going on.  
  
He hadn‚Äôt signed Lily‚Äôs resignation yet‚Äîbut she‚Äôd already given up and stopped working.  
  
The coffee John used to drink was always brewed by Lily herself.  
  
Wayne had tasted it before‚Äîso good that even top baristas would struggle to replicate it.  
  
Compared to hers, anyone else‚Äôs brew might as well have been sewage. Of course John hated it.  
  
Wayne swallowed hard and said honestly, ‚ÄúBoss, it wasn‚Äôt Ms. Lily. She just‚Ä¶ she submitted her resignation. Should I sign it?‚Äù  
  
*Resign?*  
  
John‚Äôs expression darkened even further.          ",1,1750839330.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

In their third year of marriage, Emma's wedding certificate was accidentally ruined by spilled coffee.

When she went to the county clerk's office to replace it, the clerk typed a few keystrokes and looked up with a puzzled expression. ""Ma'am, your marital status shows as single.""

She froze, certain she'd misheard. ""That's impossible. My husband and I got our license right here three years ago.""

The clerk checked again, her expression growing increasingly awkward. ""The system confirms you're single, but Mr. Chase is listed as married..."" She hesitated. ""His spouse is registered as another woman‚ÄîStella Reed. Do you know her?""

Emma's mind exploded with white noise, her ears ringing sharply.

Everyone knew Emma and Dominic Chase had grown up together. She was his first love, the one he'd protected fiercely since childhood.

And Stella Reed?

She was the replacement Dominic had found during the two years Emma studied abroad‚Äîsomeone to fill the void when he missed her too much.

\---

Emma clutched the coffee-stained fake marriage certificate as she numbly got into her car.

Her phone vibrated twice, and Dominic's message appeared on the screen.

\[Baby, I ditched a billion-dollar deal, bought your favorite roses and that strawberry cake you love, just so I could come home early to be with you. I miss you so much. Do you miss me?\]

She stared at the message and let out a hollow laugh that quickly dissolved into tears streaming down her cheeks.

For three years, he'd asked her that same question daily, expressing his supposed devotion.

But all along... he'd been legally married to someone else behind her back.

She remembered when they were children, how Dominic had fallen from a ten-foot tree trying to retrieve her kite, breaking his arm but still smiling as he handed her the kite, saying, ""Don't cry, Em. It doesn't hurt.""

She remembered her fifteenth birthday, when he stood in the rain outside her house all night just to be the first to wish her happy birthday when she woke up.

She remembered her eighteenth birthday celebration, when he rented an entire amusement park and knelt beneath exploding fireworks, saying, ""Emma, when I turn twenty-two, will you marry me?""

She remembered when she left to study abroad, how he'd pressed her against the airport wall, his voice trembling: ""Two years. I'm only giving you two years, and then I'm coming to bring you back.""

During those two years overseas, he video-called almost daily.

Once when she was too busy with essays to answer for three days, she discovered he'd been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.

Through the screen, his bloodshot eyes pleaded: ""Baby, I can't live without you.""

She always reassured him: ""I'll be home soon. Just wait a little longer.""

The day she returned, she didn't tell Dominic, wanting to surprise him.

Instead, when she pushed open the door to his private club room, she found him passionately kissing a girl whose profile looked strikingly similar to her own.

Her bag dropped with a thud, and she fled.

Dominic chased after her like a madman. When she wouldn't answer his calls, he bombarded her with messages. When she refused to see him, he stood in the rain outside her apartment, explaining over and over.

""It's not what you think!""

""I missed you so much these years when you wouldn't let me visit, so I found someone who reminded me of you...""

""I swear, we just hugged and kissed, nothing more!""

""Emma, I was wrong, but I truly love you to the point of insanity...""

Finally, after he stood in the rain for three days and nights, collapsing with pneumonia and still refusing to leave the hospital, her heart softened, and she forgave him.

Afterward, he treated her just as wonderfully as before.

Until after they married, when she discovered his assistant had been replaced by Stella Reed. That ""replacement"" he claimed to have sent away.

He explained again: ""Her parents are sick, and they struggled adjusting to the city life. She begged to come back to North Bay...""

""She applied for my assistant position without my knowledge.""

""She's exceptionally qualified and passed all the selection rounds. I can't just fire her without cause.""

So Emma tolerated it again.

Never imagining that her tolerance would turn her into the butt of a cosmic joke.

As her car pulled into their gated community, Emma's tears had dried.

She took a deep breath, about to push open the front door when she overheard Dominic talking with his friend in the living room:

""I just came from the hospital. Stella's fine, just some minor scrapes. You should stay home with Emma, don't worry.""

Dominic lounged on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed. He frowned and extinguished his friend's cigarette, his voice low and cold: ""How many times have I told you not to smoke in my house? Emma hates the smell.""

""Fine, fine, you obsessive husband,"" his friend teased. ""But I really don't understand‚Äîif you love Emma so much, why did you insist on marrying Stella? Honestly, is she more than just a replacement to you?""

The air stilled for several seconds.

Then Dominic's deep voice broke the silence:

""What if she is?""

""I used to think she was just a stand-in until Emma returned. Then I wouldn't need her anymore.""

""But after sending her away, I dreamed about her almost every night.""

""Eventually I couldn't stand her not being near me, so I brought her back as my assistant.""

""I can't live without Emma, but Stella... I can't let her go either.""

""Emma gets my public devotion, while Stella stays in the shadows with a marriage certificate as compensation. What's wrong with that?""

His friend sighed. ""Aren't you afraid Emma will find out? With her personality, if she ever discovers this, you could die at her feet and she'd never look back.""

Dominic fell silent, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. ""Then she'll never find out.""

Emma stood frozen outside the door, feeling her blood turn to ice. She'd expected to break down sobbing, but found she couldn't even squeeze out a tear.

So this was what absolute pain felt like‚Äîlike having your heart carved out while it still beat.

She thought about how Dominic had tenderly kissed her forehead that morning before leaving; how he'd hold her when drunk and murmur, ""Baby, I can't live without you""; how he'd warm her cold hands against his chest, saying his heart beat only for her‚Ä¶

But it was all a lie.

On her way home, she'd even wondered if he had some desperate explanation.

Now she knew‚Äîhe hadn't chosen between two women. He'd wanted both: one as his public beloved, one as his legal wife.

Fine!

If Dominic feared her finding out, she'd show him what ""never looking back"" truly meant.

She turned and left, immediately doing two things...

Chapter 2

First, she applied to cancel all her identity information in the country.

Second, she changed her name.

The clerk informed her all paperwork would be processed within two weeks.

After two weeks, even if Dominic searched heaven and earth, he'd never find her.

Emma turned and left, her phone buzzing frantically in her bag‚Äîall missed calls and messages from Dominic.

She didn't look or respond.

By the time she returned home, night had fallen.

Dominic stood in the living room, rushing toward her the moment she entered, his eyes filled with obvious anxiety: ""Baby, where have you been? I came home and couldn't find you. I've been waiting for hours, nearly turned the whole city upside down looking for you.""

His concern seemed genuine.

Emma stared at him, her heart seized by an invisible hand.

She suddenly remembered high school, when he'd abandoned a math competition mid-exam to rush back when she was an hour late responding to his message, terrified something had happened to her.

A man who clearly loved her so much, someone she once believed saw her as the most important person in his world. Yet looking at everything now, the love he gave was never truly exclusive.

Her throat felt blocked, making every breath painful, but ultimately, she replied calmly, ""I went shopping and forgot to tell you. Sorry.""

Only then did Dominic finally relaxed, pulling her into his arms: ""Don't apologize. I wasn't angry, just worried.""

As he spoke, he kissed the top of her head, his tone gentle: ""Alright baby, you mentioned the other day you were craving those sweet and tangy BBQ ribs and that herb-crusted sea bass. I'll make them for you right now, okay?""

With that, he released her and headed to the kitchen.

Emma stood at the doorway, silently watching Dominic. He rolled up his shirt sleeves, his long fingers skillfully chopping vegetables, his profile looking especially gentle in the warm light.

She suddenly remembered how, three years ago when she first returned, her chronic stomach problems from irregular eating had hospitalized her.

Back then, Dominic‚Äîa billionaire CEO who'd never cooked‚Äîspent a month learning from top chefs to prepare proper meals for her.

Once, when an international video conference clashed with his cooking time, he propped his tablet in the kitchen, listening to reports while stir-frying, shocking his executives.

He once loved her so intensely, as if his entire universe revolved around her.

But right now? The second his phone buzzed, his expression subtly shifted, and he immediately set down the knife, hastily wiping his hands.

""Baby, there's an emergency at the company. I need to go in."" He removed his apron, his tone casual, even remembering to kiss her forehead. ""I've finished three dishes. Eat first, don't wait for me.""

Emma said nothing, just nodded.

After he left, she approached the dining table, looking at the still-steaming dishes, her chest suddenly too painful to breathe.

She'd just seen clearly‚Äîthat call was from Stella.

Instead of sitting down to eat as he'd asked, she called a car and followed him.

Sure enough, Dominic wasn't headed to the company but to the hospital.

In the VIP wing corridor, the entire floor had been cleared, with only a few doctors and nurses standing outside a room, looking tense.

The hospital director was bowing apologetically to Dominic: ""Mr. Chase, we're truly sorry. It was our negligence that allowed Ms. Reed to slip in the bathroom. We'll assign additional staff and ensure this never happens again!""

Dominic's face was grim, his voice icy: ""If there's a next time, this hospital won't stay in business.""

The director nodded repeatedly: ""Yes, yes, we'll be extremely careful!""

Emma stood at the corner, her fingernails digging into her palms.

His friend had mentioned Stella only had ""minor scrapes."" Yet Dominic had reserved an entire building for her, and now that something had happened, he looked ready to tear down the hospital.

The door opened, revealing Stella lying weakly against the headboard, pale-faced with reddened eyes.

Dominic strode over, grabbing her hand: ""How are you? Where does it hurt?""

Stella's eyes welled up, her voice choked: ""This is all my fault. Getting hit by a car was bad enough, but then falling in the shower? Now you can't even spend time with Emma... What if she gets suspicious? I'm like a walking disaster magnet...""

""Don't talk nonsense,"" he scolded, though his tone remained gentle. ""Just focus on recovering. I'll stay with you these next few days.""

Stella looked up with tear-filled eyes: ""But what about Emma?""

Dominic replied dismissively: ""I'll handle it. Don't worry.""

After a pause, he added: ""We're husband and wife. Isn't it natural for me to stay with you?""

Chapter 3

Emma's blood instantly froze.

Husband and wife? What fine words.

But before she could recover, she watched Dominic remove the prayer beads from his wrist and gently place them on Stella's hand.

""And stop calling yourself a disaster,"" he said. ""These blessed beads‚ÄîI've worn them for seven years. Now they're yours to keep you safe.""

Tears streaming down her face, Stella lunged forward with overwhelming emotion and threw herself into his arms.

Emma stood outside, her vision blurring as if drowning in deep water. Her entire being felt like it was suffocating.

Those prayer beads...

She'd gotten them on her eighteenth birthday, crawling on her knees through the pilgrimage path, performing the traditional prostration every few yards all the way from the mountain base to the abbey summit.

That day, torrential rain had soaked the ground, leaving her knees bleeding and palms raw by the time the abbot finally blessed the beads in the sacred ritual.

When she returned, Dominic saw her battered state and immediately reddened eyes, pulling her into his arms, his voice trembling: ""Emma, have you lost your mind? Who made you suffer like this?""

She'd smiled, placing the beads on his wrist: ""The abbot said these will keep you safe and grant you longevity.""

He'd kissed her, promising: ""I'll wear them for life.""

For seven years, he never removed them. Not during the most formal business occasions, not during their most intimate moments‚Äîthe beads remained on his wrist.

But now, he'd placed them on another woman's hand.

Witnessing this scene with her own eyes, her heart felt like it was being slowly carved open with a dull blade, the pain so intense she could barely breathe.

So his ""lifetime"" had lasted just seven years.

She turned to leave, her steps unsteady as if walking on cotton.

By the time she returned home, night had fallen.

She'd barely entered when her phone vibrated with Dominic's message:

\[Baby, the company has an urgent matter abroad. I'll be gone for a few days. Don't be angry; I'll make it up to you when I return.\]

Emma stared at the screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, trembling slightly as she typed:

\[Is it really a few days for business, or a few days with your wife?\]

But ultimately, she deleted the words one by one, tears falling onto the screen, blurring her vision.

After that, she spent the time packing‚Äîdocuments, passport, bank cards... everything that could prove her identity went into her suitcase.

Three days later, Dominic returned.

He pushed open the door carrying a large bouquet of roses and a strawberry cake, smiling tenderly: ""Baby, I'm back.""

Emma stood in the center of the living room, silently watching him.

He approached, placing the flowers and cake on the table, reaching to embrace her: ""Work was incredibly busy these past few days, requiring my presence overseas. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left you for so long. Don't be angry, okay?""

She shifted slightly, avoiding his embrace, her tone flat: ""I'm not angry. Go take care of your business.""

He paused, then smiled: ""I'm done with work. Now my job is to make you happy.""

He took her hand, his eyes expectant: ""I've prepared a surprise for you.""

Without waiting for her response, he led her to the car.

Half an hour later, they stopped before a concert hall.

Emma walked inside to find the entire venue had been reserved, with people seated around, whispering as they entered:

""Mr. Chase really went all out, renting the entire concert hall just for Emma!""

""Word is he flew in her favorite orchestra from Europe‚Äîthey're playing exclusively for her all day long.""

""That ensemble's fee has skyrocketed lately. This must have cost him seven figures, minimum.""

""Please‚Äîthat's nothing. His reputation for spoiling his wife is practically legendary!""

Emma stood in the brilliant light, surrounded by admiring whispers, while Dominic's tender smile filled her vision.

Yet her heart felt submerged in ice water, painfully cold.

He gave her grand gestures and romance, while giving another woman legal marriage.

He let her live in the spotlight of public admiration, while letting another woman exist on his marriage certificate.",1,1750839181.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

1ljzv52,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ljzv52/the_big_empty/,The Big Empty,"Hey y'all, this is the first short story I've ever written, so don't expect it to be that good lol. Still, any critique is appreciated. Okay, now on to the story. 

My son died two weeks ago. Self inflicted, I should clarify. From what I was told, there was no note. No odd behavior. No signals or warning signs. It was as if God just couldn't wait long enough, and decided to take him right then and there. One day he was here, and then he wasn't. But that's how it always goes, doesn't it? There are very few deaths that are to be expected. I should feel worse than this. I should be isolating myself, and withdrawing from every event like a person grieving does. But the truth is, I'm not sad. Not as much as I should be, anyways. You see, my son and I were never very close. The only reason I know he exists in the first place is because of the angry text I received after I left my ex-girlfriend. She was pregnant, and I was a coward. So I left. Me and him have never talked. I don't think he even knew what I looked like. I only found out what his name was when the funeral invitation arrived in my mailbox. His name was Dustin. Fitting, I can only assume. I haven't the faintest idea why I was even invited in the first place. I was as much of a father to him as a turtle is a mother to her children. When a turtle hatches, they have to crawl, and crawl, and crawl, and hope they don't get picked off before they can make it to the sea. In a way, Dustin was in the same situation. He had to crawl his way through life without a father. I can only imagine what that was like. Of course, I didn't give a sermon at the funeral. What could I even say? That I was the seed responsible for his creation and absolutely nothing else? So I just sat in the back the whole time. Didn't speak to anyone, I hardly even made eye contact with a single person, and, if I did, I immediately looked somewhere else. I was ashamed, and everyone knew it. After everybody had their say, I stood up and left without consoling any of the many crying family members and friends. I don't know them, and they don't know me. In my opinion, it should stay that way. They would be better not knowing me anyways. 

Only two days after my son's funeral, I was sent on another mission. NASA said that they were, ""Testing out the capabilities of a new type of satellite."" Whatever that entails. To be honest, I wasn't paying enough of my attention to the briefing. My mind has been clouded with a never ending high-tide of questions and doubts after I had to watch my estranged son's lifeless body be slowly dropped down into the soil, back with the earth. I'm just hoping that dull responsibilities can distract me from my own nibbling conciounce. 

It's just me and one other astronaut on this satellite. His name is Chris, and he seems reasonable enough. We've slowly been getting used to eachother over the course of a week, and, while I still may not know much about him, I do know one thing. One thing that has delayed me from sleeping almost every night. He talks in his sleep. Loudly. Like he's having a drunken conversation at a club blasting music, and he doesn't realize that he's the loudest drunkard in the room. And every time he does, he says the same three words. ""Help...me...dad."" And every time he does, he turns to face me, eyes still closed, says his line, and then turns the other way. It creeps me the fuck out. It's as if his subconscious knows this vile regret in me exists, and is choosing to actively mock it every time he isn't at the wheel. Every time I've told him about it, he just tells me that no one else has ever said he talks in his sleep, so maybe I'm just hearing things due to a lack of rest, or a change in living climate, or whatever dumb excuse it was that he said. Thankfully, tonight is one of those nights where he shuts up. Maybe, just maybe, I can finally get some shut-eye in this claustrophobic hunk of metal and computers. 


I was awoken by a violent tussle from Chris. He was freaking the hell out, screaming at me like a hawk. ""Eric, wake the fuck up! Something fucking awful happened, man!"" I hoisted myself up and rubbed my eyes, forcing myself to get out of my sleeping bag with a mental slap to the wrist. ""What, Chris? What's so bad that you need to force me up like that?"" He paced around the room like a coke addict with no money, fumbling with every finger and biting every nail. ""Ok, so when I woke up, I tried to contact Houston for a daily check up, right? And when they didn't answer, I looked out the window to check if it was daytime for headquarters, and then..."" His breath quickly caught up to speed with his anxiety. He was breathing in and out so fast I thought he was going to pass out. He stammered out, ""Jesus fucking Christ, dude! What the hell are we going to do?"" He threw his hands behind his head and continued to pace. Not trying to force an explanation out of his panicked state, I take a look out the window myself, and when I do, my heart drops as far down as it can go. Earth was gone. So was the Moon, so was Venus, and so was Mercury. In fact, as far as I could see, every single planet had disappeared as if they were never there in the first place. The only body that remained was the Sun, burning ever brighter now that there were no more planets to absorb it's heat. Somehow, we had not completely floated off into God knows where. In fact, we weren't moving at all. Our satellite was the only thing left, and it was like someone had dropped an anchor into the nonexistent sand below us. I clamp my hands on to the window frame, trying to hold back the vomit that had slithered its way up my throat. This has to be a nightmare, some twisted fear my brain has constructed into a play-by-play for me to witness. But no matter how hard I pinched myself, or slapped my face, or prayed to God that this would end, nothing ever happened. I never woke up. I was stuck here. Stuck in this God-forsaken satellite with limited energy, and even more limited supplies. May God lend out his lucky rabbit's foot to me. All I can rely on is a miracle. 

Chris and I haven't spoken to eachother since. We're both too shell-shocked to form a legible thought out of our heads. The echoes of conversation that have typically ruled these rooms have been replaced with dead air, and loud, ear piercing silence. Eventually, I force myself to talk, a task that used to seem so simple. ""How many rations do we have left,"" I asked. Chris hesitated, not because he didn't know, but because he knew the uncomfortable truth. ""We only have enough for one more week. After that..."" His voice trailed off, his fear restricting him from facing the reality of our situation. He then began to cry. Loud and violent. I'm guessing the full weight of our situation had finally dropped down onto his head harder than an anvil. And if I were a more outwardly emotional man, I would be crying too. The last time I truly cried was when my mother finally flatlined from the cancer that was ravaging her body, consuming her like a starved cannibal. But that was years ago, and I have never once shed a tear since. Not knowing what else to do with myself, I silently make my way into our psuedo kitchen to make us both some coffee. It seems stupid I know, but in a situation like this, what else can you do but hold on to some comfort? Something to take your mind off of the snake's belly that is currently digesting you? As I stare blankly at the machine doing its work, more focused on my own thoughts than my surroundings, I'm jolted out of my conscious slumber to the loud, berating sound of the airlock opening. It was Chris. And I immediately processed what he was doing. He was trying to kill himself. As quickly as I can, I rush my way to the airlock, brushing past walls, and bumping my way through random objects. But by the time I reach him, my worst fears ring true. I watch as Chris jumps out into the black mass of space without a suit. In an instant, his skin turns cold and his veins turn blue, and the shape of his body puffs up and expands, his bodily fluids quickly boiling over and freezing in a process so quick it almost seems like a mercy. I pound on the window so hard that my hand begins to sting. ""Goddamit, Chris!"" But it's no use. My voice falls on deaf ears, and all that remains of Chris is a bloated, floating corpse of what used to be a man. A man with a story, and a family, and dreams. One second he was here, the next, he wasn't. My own worries escape my vocal folds, no louder than a mouse. ""I'm going to die out here.""

It's been two hours since Chris took the leap of faith, and I'm starting to wonder if I should do the same. Realistically, what other choice do I have? Either I die in here, or I die out there. I have no home to return to, and there is no saving me. There is no last second rescue like some sort of shitty action movie. All I'm doing is delaying the inevitable and wasting God's time. But some stubborn, seething whisper within me is begging me to hold on. To not be the coward I was all those years ago. I need to survive. I need to go on. What honor is a man who besmirches his own death? If I was going to die, I was going to go out kicking and screaming. I take my white-knuckled hand off of the airlock door. Not now, not ever. I head back to our quarters. I was hardly awake to begin with, and the trauma of watching the only other human left in existence perish before my eyes has exhausted me to a bitter end. I will be more logical if I'm rested anyways. So I slip into my sleeping bag, and slowly but surely, drift off into sleep. 

After God knows how long, my eyes flutter open, and I'm flung back into Hell. But when I wake up, something is off. It takes a second for my recently rebooted mind to process, but once it does, even more panic sets in. There is no way to turn off the lights in this satellite, but somehow, they're off. And it's not like the power has gone out, I can see the faint glow of the computer screen emenating from the room over. Someone, or something, has caused the lights to go out. Before I can figure out if I'm already losing my mind, another unnoticed detail rears its ugly head into my perception. I'm lying on a mattress. Not a sleeping bag, but a mattress. How is this even possible? There is no way a matress would make it's way up here, and even if it did, it would be affected by the lack of gravity, and yet here I am, lying on the ground on a mattress as if I'm still on a planet with a source of gravity. In fact, I'm no longer floating either. I realize that I feel the full effects of gravity like I'm back on Earth. I try not to freak out, and instead push my muscles, unadjusted to gravity, to stand up so I can rationally reason with the panicked insanity threatening to win me over. As I pull my body up, I am suddenly and violently pulled back down by an arm. There is another person laying on this mattress with me, one that was not there before. I shakily, dreadfully, slowly turn my head to face whatever God forbidden demon that awaits my gaze, and what I see is far worse than any monster hiding in a closet. Staring right back at me is the preserved, lifeless face of my son, Dustin. It's as if he crawled out of that grave and on to this station, eyes pried open and mouth clamped shut in an unnatural taxidermy of the human face. I try to scream, try to move, but he covers my mouth and keeps me held in place. No matter how much I squirm or thrash, he's too overbearing to escape. Through clenched teeth, he forces his glued mouth to open, ripping apart the skin of his lips as he does so. With furrowed brows and an unquenchable fury in his eyes, he then begs agitatededly, yet somehow, at the same time, mericifully, ""Help...me...dad. I'm...so cold...Dad...It hurts...so much...They're consuming me...Please."" As if on que, an uncountable amount of maggots burst out from under his skin, all of them crawling up his arm and into my now held open mouth. I scream, but it's quickly stifled by the maggots as they forcefully wriggle their way down my throat. I can feel each and every one trying to map out the lining of my intestines, and it's excruciating. Any stragglers that couldn't fit into my mouth are now finding other ways of entry, burrowing into my skin and forcing their way down under it. It's as if Dustin is transferring all of his hatred towards his absent father, and that disgrace of a man is feeling that pain a hundred times over. After what feels like an eternity of being treated like soil, the bugs inside me stop moving, and Dustin has been reduced to a wrinkled tuxedo beside me. I grasp at my chest and inhale a breath so sharp it could cut a ribbon. That should have killed me. I should have died a few seconds in, and yet here I am, miraculously moving and breathing and thinking. After a moment of recollection, I force my body to pull itself up, the maggots jostling inside me with each muscle bended, making it a dire effort to complete such a basic task. It's as if I'm relearning to move my body. No, it's more like I'm being thrown out of mama bird's nest and being forced to put effort into my movement for the very first time. Each step and hobble is accompanied by the feeling of an ungodly amount of maggots repositioning themselves with the flow of my movement. Every foot planted down on the ground is a triumph. Any attempt to expel the maggots via dry heaving is met with the unfathomably cringey feeling of a solid wall of maggots filling my esophagus, preventing any possible chance of eviction from my stomach. I need to find a way to get them out, and I need to do it fast. 

I hobble through the doorway like a zombie with a broken leg, groaning out in pain and discomfort with every inch forward. I pull myself through, but I can only handle so much before I inevitably lose balance. I face plant on to the ground, but rather than feeling cold, hard steel, I feel the familiar warmth of a carpet. No longer can I feel the maggots within me, but now, I am met with a new problem. Rather than the inside of a space station like one would expect, I am instead met with the sight of my mother's living room. I once again force myself up, dazed and confused by the instantaneous change of scenery. I haven't seen the inside of my mom's house since she died, and the sight of it makes me sick. But why am I here? How did I get here? I try the front door, but it's locked, and the locks won't budge. I'm assuming that if one door is like this, they'll all be. There's no way out of it. Not this time. From upstairs, I hear the faint melody of classical music. Slowly, I creep my way up the matted steps. And as I look around, aside from the mixture of disgust, fear, and a disgraceful form of nostalgia, I notice that every single picture hung on the walls of this house that has my mother included has my mother's face blurred out. God, why can't I remember what she looked like? Why can't I remember her name? No, this can't be happening. I can't forget her. Out of all people to forget, I can't forget her. Please. I bang my head against the wall. Hard. ""Please, God! What have I done? Let me repent! Please Father, please don't abandon me!...Say something!"" The silence is long, and drawn out. I asked, and that was His answer. Just silence. Just the sound of classical music and small creaks of the old house. I continue my journey, eventually reaching the door of my mom's bedroom. I grip on to the doorknob, and for the longest time I hesitate to enter. I can't see her again. Not after I abandoned her on her deathbed. What will she say to me? What will that feeling of regret do to me once it bubbles back up to the surface? No, I'm done being a coward. I'm done running away. If there's ever anything I can do right in my life, it's this. I push the door open with full force. I'm quickly blinded by a singeing bright light that takes up my retinas, consuming my vision. Once the intensity dies down as my pupils adjust, I'm no longer in the house. I'm in a hospital room, and on the hospital bed in front of me is my mother, her face blurry and impossible to recognize. My voice breaks free in a shakey tone as I call out to her, my guilt almost prying its way out via my tear ducts. But I stop it. Force it down. ""M-mom? Is that you?"" The voice that responds is not the sickly one I grew to despise, the voice that was signifying the end of my only loving parent's life. Instead, my mom sounded like she used to, with that sweet, motherly tone I was nurtured by. It was like listening to silk, and honey, and childhood. ""Of course it's me, silly? Who else would it be?"" She signed off her sentence with a light giggle, as if everything was just how it was. As if I were really back home. As if I just got home from my first day of school and she was comforting me for being so brave. All of these memories of my childhood that I've intentionally repressed for so long come flooding back in a second, causing my head to burst with pain. I fall to my knees beside her and wince. ""Agh, Mom, it really hurts. My head hurts so bad."" She wraps her arms around what she can reach of me and responds with a simple, ""Sshhh, it's ok baby. Nothing will hurt you. Not as long as I'm here."" She hoists my head up, hands on my cheeks, and for the first time in years, I sob. I sob like a child. I sob harder than I ever have before. Through teary eyes and sniffles, I cry out to my mom for forgiveness. ""I didn't...I didn't mean to leave you mom, I just couldn't bare the sight of seeing you dying in front of me. But I shouldn't have left you. I shouldn't have left you."" My head falls on to her and she holds me tightly. ""I know you didn't mean to, honey. We all make mistakes. I'm not mad at you. I could never be mad at you."" I look up at her, face still blurred. ""Mom...why can't I remember what you look like? I don't want to forget you."" She sighed deeply, and I knew what was about to kick me in the teeth. ""I'm so sorry honey, but there's nothing I can do about that. You can't fix what's been damaged beyond repair."" I take a moment to respond. I don't know what to say. 
Instead, I choose to focus on the feeling of my Mom's warmth. I want to stay in her arms forever, never let this moment go. But I can sense that this is yet another fleeting scene. I know I will have to leave soon. ""So that's it? I'll never get to remember what my own mother looked like?"" She simply nodded in response. I can't help but chuckle to myself, shaking my head in disbelief. I want to scream. I want to scream, and thrash, and bash at His Holiness for toying with me, the way a ventriloquist shoves their hand into a puppet, robbing them of autonomy. But rather than dwell on the elephant in the room, I choose to have one final conversation with my mother. The one I never got to have. The one I should've had before it was too late. I know this probably isn't my mother. I know that this could very well just be my purgatory or some insane psychological test concocted by my own delusions and isolation. And yet, I still love her. All of me still wants to treat her as if she really is my mother. So I continue. ""Did you know that I'm an astronaut now mom? I bet you'd be proud of me."" She smiled ever so softly, I could tell, even through those blurred lines. We talked and talked. We talked about all of the things I never told her. Including Dustin, and everything surrounding him. I told her about everything I'd done since she left. Everything she never got to see for herself. After what felt like hours of conversation, I began to feel my eyelids growing heavy. I tried to fight it. I didn't want this to end, I don't want to go back. Please don't make me leave. My brain berates my body, but my body has given up on listening. It knows that this is a fight not worth fighting. So as I kneel down beside her bed and lay my head on her chest, my mom sings to me the tune she used to comfort me with anytime I was scared. The melody is like a drug, washing over my rebellion of sleep. I wanted to say something, one final goodbye before this was truly over. But my mouth wouldn't open, and the words never got to have their say. Eventually, my eyelids closed, and I fell asleep in my mother's arms. One last time. 

I've decided that the airlock is the best way to go. After waking back up in the eerily dark corridors of this satellite and considering all my options, this seems like the most peaceful way to die, all things considered. Maybe I'll finally get to see my mom again. Maybe I'll get to apologize to Dustin, and anyone else I've hurt by constantly running from my problems. But this time, I'm running towards them. With full speed, and full confidence. With one final sigh, I latch open the airlock door, and go through the motions. And finally, with one last leap of faith, I jump out into the big empty. As my vision fades and my thoughts dim, I look out at the Sun. What used to be an everyday normalcy looks so much more beautiful up close. This heavenly ball of light will be what watches over me as I'm caught in the newly grown wings of an angel. I don't think it's ever shone so brightly.

I'm visiting Pula once a year since my father lives there. Unfortunately, he has a very... individual and non-conventional lifestyle and cannot help me figure out some basic questions I have about your wonderful city. 

My first question is - is there a place where I can buy specialty coffee (third wave coffee)? I'm talking about that snobbishly expensive, often single origin stuff that tastes like ""blueberry, elderflower and black tea"" kind of stuff. To add some extra difficulty to the task, I am looking for filter coffee/beans, not espresso. (Hopefully this doesn't offend anyone - I love espresso too, I just cannot drink as much of it.)

I know Cafe Frei and I like their coffee creations, and it's the closest thing I found to a place that cares about high quality coffee, but as of last year they didn't sell coffee beans for home brewing anymore. 

There was supposedly a store called ""specialty coffee at verdura"", but they also didn't sell beans and seemed off guard when I asked them about coffee in general.

We are limited to Pula and surroundings, I have seen that some other cities (mostly Zagreb of course) do sell specialty coffee, but maybe there is some hidden corner in your lovely town that I have been not aware of the last three years? ",1,1750838402.0,pulaHR,0,1.0,False

Quite common in the military, I didn‚Äôt really like it though as it‚Äôs not the sort of place you can always have a joke with them, you could know 100% they were joking, but you‚Äôd still play along with the impossible task because it felt like you had to.

There was an NCO just above me who was a bit of a dick with stuff like this. I was heading somewhere and he asked me to go and sign off a small bit of equipment.

This was a fools errand. But the joke item is so specific to what we were doing at that certain time that it is very hard to explain why it would be a joke. So for this post I‚Äôm just going to say he asked me to get a ‚Äòglass hammer‚Äô.

As I said this was a huge complex, you needed a vehicle to get anywhere. So I went to the stores and asked them, I wasn‚Äôt ashamed, as I said the joke was so specific to us that other units probably wouldn‚Äôt have even got it.

Then to the mechanics, then to the kitchen, then to Comms guys, then to HQ etc

I spent the whole day driving around the base, searching for this mystery item, having coffees and cigarettes, having a laugh with people in other units. Seeing areas I would usually not have an excuse to go.

I wasn't sure.I clenched my jaw, fighting the sting of tears.It was our third wedding anniversary today, not that Carter remembered.Not that he ever cared.I was his secretary in name, his wife in title only.But I wished he would only just forget it and not spend it giggling with another woman.Or maybe I was the other woman because they looked like the perfect couple.‚ÄúDo you remember that one time we went bowling? When you couldn't even hit a single pin for the life of you?‚Äù Meghan's pitchy voice rang out.‚ÄúOkay, now you're exaggerating. That is not how I remember it!‚Äù Carter defended with a light chuckle, tears pricked my eyes.Since Meghan returned to the country two months ago, everything has changed. Carter, who was always distant but at least polite, now treated me like I didn't exist. Meghan was always around, using the pretence of ""cooperation"" to cling to him, and Carter let her.I could only keep hurting in silence cause what could I say? Our marriage had been a mistake from the start, forcedly by circumstance rather than love. Yet I was so happy to marry my crush even though he was just doing his grandfather's bidding.Still, I had hoped. Hoped that three years might soften his heart, that maybe he'll notice how much I loved him. But watching him now, so carefree with Meghan, my hope seemed more foolish than ever.I watched as Meghan tilted her head, flashing him that perfect, coy smile. He leaned closer, his face soft with amusement. My chest tightened painfully. I told myself to walk away, to stop torturing myself.But when I heard Meghans voice again, loud and flirtatious, ‚ÄúOh, K!You haven't changed one bit and I like it‚ÄùIt was followed by another groan of laughter from Carter, I couldn't take it anymore.Before I knew it, I was opening the door. Their gazes immediately snapped at me, and I felt like an intruder.‚ÄúCarter‚Äù, I called out, trying to sound calm even though my voice trembled a bit, ‚ÄúI need to talk to you. It's urgent‚Äù.The laughter stopped. Carter turned to me, his expression hardening instantly. ‚ÄúVeronica!‚Äù, he said sharply, ""I'm busy. Can't it wait?‚Äù.My heart clenched tightly. Wow! He was really busy indeed.Meghan, seated gracefully in her chair, smirked. ‚ÄúOh, Carter, let her speak. I'm sure it's important‚Äù, she said, her tone dripping with mock sweetness.I ignored her, though it took every ounce of self control in me. ‚ÄúI won't take much of your time‚Äù, I said, my voice quieter now.Carter sighed, leaning back in his chair. ‚ÄúFine. What is it?‚Äù, his voice was dripping with annoyance.Meghan stood, brushing imaginary lint from her dress. ‚ÄúI'll step out and give you two some privacy‚Äù she said lightly.But as she passed me, she bumped into my arm, knocking the teacup from my hand, whispering‚ÄúYou can pretend to talk to him all you want but in the end, he'll come running back to the woman he loves. He always does‚Äù.The porcelain shattered on the floor, tea splashing across my shoes and hand. Meghan immediately let out a fake cry even though only a little of it splashed on her wrist ‚Äì that is if it did at all.‚ÄúWhy would you do that?!‚Äù She cried out.‚ÄúI know you don't like me but why would you go this far to prove your point?‚Äù She added a look of sorrow and hurt on her face.I stared at her, my hands trembling from the heat seeping through my skin.I was the one hurt, and she was the one screaming after bumping into me intentionally? She easily smirked at me since her back was facing Carter.Before I could respond, Carter's voice cut through the tension.‚ÄúWhat's going on?‚Äù he demanded, standing abruptly from where he was previously seated.Meghan turned to him with teary, innocent eyes. ‚ÄúVeronica bumped into me, but it's fine. I don't want to make a big deal out of it. I'll just go to the hospital‚Äù.‚ÄúThat's not true,‚Äù I said, my voice sharp. ‚ÄúShe was the one‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù Carter snapped, his voice like a slap and I flinched.‚ÄúWhy can't you just let things go for once? Even if she did something wrong to you, pouring hot coffee on her isn't the right way to go about it! Apologize to Meghan right now!‚Äù.I blinked, stunned. He didn't even let me explain myself, but he was quick to take her words over mine. He didn't even bother to check if I was fine.‚Äú Apologize?‚Äù My voice cracked slightly. ‚ÄúCarter, I didn't do anything wrong‚Äù.Carter's jaw tightened, his eyes cold.‚ÄúI don't have time for this, Veronica. Apologize now!‚Äù‚ÄúIt's okay, Carter. Please don't fight her over me. I'm used to being bullied,‚Äù Meghan sniffled and I stared at her in disbelief.‚ÄúI didn't do anything! You bumped into me!‚Äù I tried to defend myself.‚ÄúI'm not going to ask you again,‚ÄùCarter growled. ‚ÄúDo it and move on‚Äù.My chest tightened, and I felt a hot tear slide down my cheek. I quickly wiped it away, not wanting to cry in front of them. ‚ÄúMove on?‚ÄùI whispered, my voice trembling.‚ÄúCarter, I'm not just your secretary. I'm your wife. Are you really going to take the words of a stranger over mine?‚Äù.The room fell into silence. Meghan looked smug, her arms crossed, while Carter's face darkened.‚ÄúYou're only my wife because of a mistake,‚Äù he said flatly.His words hit me like a punch to the gut. I had always known our marriage wasn't built on love, but hearing him say it out aloud, so coldly, so carelessly, made the hurt more unbearable.Chapter 2No LoveVeronica's POVI took a shaky breath‚Äú A mistake?‚Äù my voice was almost inaudible.‚ÄúDo you have any idea how long I've loved you, Carter? How hard have I tried to make this work?‚Äù My voice broke.‚ÄúThree years‚Ä¶ three years of trying to be someone you could care for and all I'll ever be to you is a mistake?‚ÄùCarter stared at me in silence for about a minute.‚ÄúThere's no love between us, Veronica. Never was. Never will,‚Äù he casually responded, like I didn't just pour out my heart to him.Carter's words hit me like a punch to the chest.My lips parted in disbelief, but no words came out. It felt like he had just confirmed every fear I had buried deep in my heart. Yet he didn't even seem to care.‚ÄúIf it weren't for you forcing me into that situation three years ago,‚Äù he continued, his tone sharp and accusatory.‚ÄúWe wouldn't be in this mess. My grandfather wouldn't have forced me to marry you‚Äù.‚ÄúForcing you?‚Äù I finally managed to whisper.My voice shook, the pain and disbelief laced in every syllable ‚ÄúCarter, you think I forced you?‚ÄùYes, what happened years ago was out of our control but it could have been anyone. His grandfather only approved of me because he genuinely liked me.Carter scoffed, his gaze cold and distant. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt play innocent. You drugged me that night, didn't you? You knew Grandpa would never let me marry Meghan. So you trapped me instead‚Äù.I felt the air leave my lungs, like I was brutally punched in my guts.‚ÄúHow could you even say those cruel words to me like I was some desperate whore? I didn't‚Ä¶ Carter, I would never‚Ä¶..‚Äù‚ÄúSave it‚Äù he snapped, cutting me off.‚ÄúI'm tired of pretending. There's nothing between us, Veronica. So grow the fuck up and stop acting childish!‚ÄùI clenched my fists at my sides, trying so hard to stop the tears that were threatening to blur my vision.‚ÄúYou've hated me for so long for something I didn't do. I loved you, Carter. I still love you. How could you think so little of me?‚ÄùHe laughed bitterly, shaking his head. ‚ÄúLove? If you loved me, you wouldn't have needed tricks to tie me down‚Äù.My heart shattered, but before I could say anything else, Meghan's voice broke the tense silence.‚ÄúCarter, let it go,‚Äù she said softly, placing a delicate hand on his arm.She looked at me with faux pity. ‚ÄúIt's not worth fighting over. Let's just go. My wrist is hurting, it needs urgent attention‚Äù.He sighed, his anger dissipating as he turned toward her. ‚ÄúI'm such a fool, how can I forget such an important matter, Let's go‚Äù.I watched, frozen, as he slipped his arm around her waist and they walked out together.She glanced back at me with a smirk, her victory written all over her face.As the door closed behind them, his words replayed over and over in my head, cutting through my heart like a double-edged sword.I sank into a nearby chair, clutching my chest as the tears spilt over.‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I got a balm for the burn on my hand and returned home alone later that evening for the family dinner.As usual, grandfather was super happy to see me.He had the maids prepare our favorites and even got us some gifts but Carter wasn't there to witness it.Everyone was gathered at the table, including Orthon, Carter's uncle who just returned from the States.Although I hadn't seen him in three years, he looked even more ethereal than the last time I saw him, and he was just three years older than Carter.‚ÄúVee, quite lovely to see you again‚Äù his polished accent was one of the most attractive things about him.He kissed my hand gently and those gorgeous sapphire blue eyes flickered to me.‚ÄúIt's lovely to see you again, Orthon,‚Äù I responded with a wide smile. ‚ÄúWhen did you get back?‚Äù I asked.‚ÄúLast night,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúYou look just as beautiful as I remember‚Äù.My cheeks coloured. He was always one to compliment me every time he set his eyes on me.‚ÄúYou don't look bad yourself,‚Äù I said sincerely.I didn't want to indulge myself too much in his looks because it made me feel like I was cheating on Carter, no matter how harmless it was.‚ÄúAnd where is your husband?‚Äù Master Grayson, Carter's Grandfather asked as I joined the table.‚ÄúOh, he might be running late,‚Äù I mumbled , feeling several pairs of eyes boring holes into my skin.‚ÄúOr maybe he just doesn't care for it,‚Äù Marian Grayson, Carter's mother sneered. The woman saw me as nothing but a gold digger and never bothered to hide her hatred for me.‚ÄúYou should watch your words, Marian‚Äù Grandfather warned, and she muttered something inaudible under her breath.Dinner went well, as long as I ignored the jabs and focused on Grandfather and Orthon. And yes, Carter didn't show up, which was no surprise at all.He was probably having fun with his mistress.Later that evening, Orthon found me sitting alone in the garden, my arms wrapped around myself to hold the broken pieces together as my miserable life played out in my head.‚ÄúVeronica,‚Äù he said gently, sitting beside me. ‚ÄúYou look like you've been crying. What happened?‚Äù He asked worriedly.I forced a shaky smile, wiping at my eyes. ‚ÄúIt's nothing, Orthon. Just a long day‚Äù.He frowned, his kind eyes filled with concern. ‚ÄúDon't lie to me. You've always been stronger than this, but at times, even the strongest people need someone to lean on‚Äù.His words broke me further, but I held myself together. ‚ÄúThank you, Orthon,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúBut I'm fine‚Äù.‚ÄúFine then, don't talk. I'll make you some hot chocolate, you'll feel better after that,‚Äù he said softly, patting my shoulder before leaving.It hurt that someone who wasn't even my husband could care for me this way while my own spouse was aiming over another woman.‚Ä¶..The call from the hospital came late that night.‚ÄúMrs. Carter, your grandmother's condition has worsened. You need to come over immediately‚Äù.I didn't think twice before rushing to the hospital.I rushed to her bedside, my heart pounding with fear.Seeing her frail figure lying in the hospital bed broke something in me.‚ÄúGrandma,‚Äù I whispered, holding her hand. ‚ÄúPlease, stay with me. I need you. You're all I have left‚Äù.She smiled weakly, cupping my face.‚ÄúDon't worry about me, child. You have suffered enough for my sake already‚Äù.Her fingers trembled as she pressed a small business card into my hand.‚ÄúIf‚Ä¶ things get too hard‚Äù she rasped, ‚Äúfind him‚Äù.‚ÄúWho, Grandma? Who should I find?‚ÄùBut she didn't answer.The monitor beside her emitted a flat line, and the nurses rushed in, pulling me away as I sobbed uncontrollably.‚ÄúNo! Please, don't leave me!‚Äù I cried, my voice breaking.But she was gone.Hours passed and I was still in the hospital lobby, sobbing over my Grandmother.As I walked down the hall, I saw Carter step out of a ward.He was surprised to see me but I didn't even have the strength to be mad at me for skipping our anniversary. I just needed comfort.‚ÄúVeronica?‚Äù He called in surprise.My grandmother just passed away, I said, tears threatening to fall. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I need you, Carter. Please‚Äù.Before he could respond, Meghan yelled from inside the ward, ‚ÄúCarter‚Äù, she gasped, ‚ÄúI don't feel well. Something is wrong with the baby‚Äù.‚ÄúBaby?‚Äù My voice rose, stunned. Meghan was pregnant?I looked at Carter, expecting some form of explanation. There was a glint of guilt in his eyes and my heart shattered instantly.‚ÄúLook, Veronica, I‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúCarter!‚Äù She screamed again. ‚ÄúMy tummy hurts. Please‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúI'm sorry, I have to go. I'll talk to you later,‚Äù he said quickly and hurried inside the ward.And just like that, my heart broke into a million pieces.Chapter 3Grandma's funeralVeronica's POVThe church was quiet, the kind of silence that pressed on your chest and made it hard to breathe.I knelt beside Grandma's coffin, my fingers trembling as I placed the plate of apple pie beside her handkerchiefs.It felt wrong somehow, offering her favourite dessert when I knew she wouldn't get to taste it again.‚ÄúYou always said this pie tasted like love,‚Äù I whispered, barely loud enough to hear myself over the pounding of my heart. ‚ÄúI hope you can feel it now, wherever you are‚Äù.My voice cracked, and I bit my lip to hold back the tears. I didn't want to cry anymore. I was tired of crying, tired of feeling like a part of me had been ripped away.A hand landed on my shoulder, startling me. For a moment, I thought it was Carter, and relief flickered in my chest like a fragile flame. But when I turned, it was Orthon.‚ÄúI'm sorry for your loss,"" he said, his voice softer than I'd ever heard it.‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I replied, my tone clipped.I didn't have the energy for pleasantries, not now.But Orthon didn't leave. Instead, he hesitated, his brows furrowing like he was working up the courage to say something. ‚ÄúI'm sorry for‚Ä¶everything else, too. For what my family did. For the pain they caused‚Äù.His words hung in the air, heavy and unexpected.I looked up at him, searching his face for insincerity, but I didn't find any.It was strange to hear an apology from someone who had done nothing but treat me right while the one who was supposed to apologise wasn't even here.‚ÄúI appreciate that,‚Äù I said finally, though the words felt hollow.Orthon nodded, his shoulders sagging in relief, and stepped away.I turned back to Grandma's coffin, brushing my fingers over the lilies arranged around her.The petals were soft and cold, like everything else today.The church doors creaked open, and I heard the familiar sound of polished shoes clicking against the floor. My stomach twisted. Carter.I didn't look up. I didn't need to.‚ÄúVeronica,‚Äù he said, his voice brisk and devoid of emotion. ‚ÄúSorry, I'm late‚Äù.Late! The word hit me like a slap. I straightened, still refusing to look at him, and adjusted the flowers for the third time. My hands shook, but I kept them busy.‚ÄúYou're always late,‚Äù I murmured, my voice low.‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù he asked, his tone indifferent, as though he hadn't just walked into the most painful moment of my life.I turned to face him slowly, my eyes locking on his. He looked pristine, as usual‚Äîhis suit perfectly tailored, his tie knotted flawlessly. Not a single hair was out of place. His expression had a flicker of pity in them but that was it.‚ÄúYou're late,‚Äù I repeated, louder this time.‚ÄúAnd I said I'm sorry about it,‚Äù he replied, shrugging slightly.‚ÄúI had back-to-back meetings. It couldn't be helped‚Äù.My chest tightened, anger rising like a tide. ‚ÄúIt couldn't be helped?‚Äù I echoed, my voice trembling.‚ÄúCarter, this is her funeral. The one person who was always there for me, and you couldn't even bother to show up on time?‚ÄùHe sighed as if I was being unreasonable. ‚ÄúYou're being dramatic. I'm here now, aren't I?‚ÄùHis words felt like a slap, and I took a step back, crossing my arms over my chest. ‚ÄúYou're always here too late. Birthdays, anniversaries, emergencies‚Äîyou never show up when it matters. You just swoop in after the damage is done and act like it's enough‚Äù.‚ÄúI'm not going to argue with you,‚Äù he said, his tone clipped.‚ÄúThis isn't the time or place for this conversation‚Äù.‚ÄúOh, now you care about timing?‚ÄùI shot back, my voice rising, along with my temper.‚ÄúYou've never cared about what I need, Carter. Not once. Do you know how many nights I've sat alone, wondering if you'd even notice if I disappeared?‚Äù‚ÄúYou're being ridiculous,‚Äù he said, his jaw tightening.‚ÄúRidiculous?‚Äù I laughed bitterly, the sound hollow and sharp.‚ÄúDo you even hear yourself? This isn't about a missed dinner or a forgotten date. This is about you never being there when I need you. This is about me finally realizing that I deserve more than scraps of your attention‚Äù.Carter's expression did not change. He didn't flinch or soften.He just stood there, his hands in his pockets, his gaze steady and cold.‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say, Veronica? That I'm sorry? Fine. I'm sorry. Can we move on now?‚ÄùThe finality of his words sank in, and something inside me broke.‚ÄúNo‚ÄùI said, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúWe can't move on. Not from this, not this time around‚Äù.He frowned, finally showing a flicker of confusion. ‚ÄúWhat's that supposed to mean?‚Äù‚ÄúIt means I'm done,‚Äù I said, meeting his gaze with a spirit of defiance that I didn't know I had.‚ÄúI'm filing for a divorce‚Äù.For the first time, his composure faltered, but only slightly. His brows furrowed, and his lips pressed into a thin line.‚ÄúYou're overreacting‚Äù.‚ÄúNo, Carter,‚Äù I said, my voice firm.‚Äú I've spent years underreacting. Years waiting for you to care enough to show up. But I'm done waiting. I deserve better than this. Better than you. I'm leaving you as both your wife and secretary!‚ÄùHe said nothing, his face hardening into an unreadable mask.I didn't wait for him to respond.I turned on my heel and walked out of the church, the sound of my footsteps echoing in the hollow silence. Behind me, I knew he wouldn't follow. He never did.Chapter 4The DivorceCarters POVI stared at the divorce papers in front of me, the harsh, cold words blurring together.When she threw the words at me during the funeral, I thought she was simply bluffing, trying to get under my skin but now, I realised how wrong I was.Veronica, my wife, the woman I had shared years of my life with, was filing for divorce. And I didn't understand why.My heart pounded in my chest, and my throat tightened with panic. The room felt suffocating. This couldn't be happening. Not like this.How could she, of all people, be the one to make this decision? Veronica had always been so meek, so patient.She never demanded anything, never pushed me, never even raised her voice in anger.She had supported me, quietly handling everything while I focused on my work.It was always this way.She has always been a steady presence in my life.And yet, here I was, holding papers that said it was over.I stood up abruptly, pacing the room.The weight of it all was crushing.The last few months had been a blur‚Äîmy focus was consumed by the company's expansion and my need to push forward to ensure everything was in place. I have been absent, I'll admit it.But I didn't think she'd notice. I didn't think she'd feel it, not this badly. And then there was Meghan.Her unexpected return. The pregnancy. It threw me off balance, made me lose my focus, made me do something I deeply regretted.I grabbed my phone and hit the speed dial for my assistant. Lawrence, ‚ÄúGet in here, Now‚Äù.It didn't take long before he showed up at my door. He walked in after a brief knock, his expression neutral but curious. ‚ÄúYes, Mr. Grayson?‚Äù.‚ÄúI need you to do something for me,‚Äù I said.‚ÄúFind out if Veronicas is seeing anyone else. I need to know. This divorce‚Ä¶ it came out of nowhere, and I don't understand why. She's always been so quiet, so patient. Now she's just done with me. I know something is up and I need to find out what‚Äù.Lawrence gave a hesitant nod, but I could see the concern in her eyes.‚ÄúOf course, Mr. Grayson. I'll handle it right away‚Äù.‚ÄúGood,‚Äù I muttered. I just need answers.I turned away from him as he left, my mind spinning.I had been so absorbed in my work that I didn't notice how much I was neglecting her.She was always there in the background, silently taking care of everything. And now, she is gone.I walked over to the window and stared out at the city below.My mind kept returning to the night Meghan returned, the mistake that had changed everything.I had been drunk, and I had made a rash decision I would regret forever.The child was innocent, and I had to make things right for them, but I never intended for it to come at the cost of my marriage.I didn't think it would push Veronica this far.I snapped back to the present when I heard Emily's voice on the intercom.‚ÄúMr. Grayson, the conference call with the investors is in fifteen minutes‚Äù.‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, trying to compose myself as I adjusted my suit.I couldn't let this affect my work.I had to maintain control, to keep everything running smoothly.The call with the investors went as expected‚Äîprofessional, calculated, and efficient. We discussed quarterly projections, new markets, and our strategy moving forward.But even as I spoke, I couldn't fully focus. My mind kept drifting back to Veronica, to what had gone wrong.As soon as the call ended, I leaned back in my chair and rubbed my temples. I should have seen it coming. I should have done something before it reached this point.I looked at the lilies and the designer bag I had bought for her, the same ones I had planned to give her to apologize for everything.What was a gift compared to what I had taken from her? It felt pathetic now, like nothing more than an empty gesture.‚ÄúMr. Grayson?‚Äù Lawrence's voice came from the door again, pulling me from my thoughts.‚ÄúYeah?‚ÄùWas he done already? That would be a relief even though it was highly impossible.‚ÄúEmily said you've been distracted all day. Perhaps, you can take a break or the entire day off if possible. I will stand in for you,‚Äù he offered.I exhaled a breath I didn't realize I was holding.It wasn't what I wanted to hear, but it was a good suggestion. I would much rather hear this than the news that my wife was actually seeing someone else. That would completely crush me.‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, voice weary. ‚ÄúThanks, Lawrence, but you don't need to worry, I can handle myself‚Äù.He hesitated for a moment before speaking again. ‚ÄúSir, I know things have been rough, but I think if this is a family issue, you should focus on resolving it as soon as possible before it escalates‚Äù.‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I murmured, staring at the lilies in front of me again. He had a point. I hadn't meant for it to end like this. I had never thought it would get this far.After Lawrence left, I went back to my desk and began sifting through emails. But it all felt like a blur.Every message, every phone call, every meeting‚Äîit all seemed pointless now. Without Veronica, what was any of this for? She had always been the one who made my life manageable, who kept everything in order.And now I was alone.The lilies on my desk and the bag I had bought for her sat untouched. Maybe I should take his advice and go home. I knew I could change her mind if I tried hard enough.I shut my system and tossed the divorce papers in the trash. I grabbed the lillies and the bags I got for her as well as my keys.With that, I headed home.Chapter 5Chapter 5Having Double MindVeronica's POVI began rethinking my decision as I packed my things.I knew I was doing the right thing but I just didn't know if I was ready to give up my feelings for Carter yet. It felt like I was giving up.Each piece of clothing I packed felt like a small severing of my past life with Carter. This house has never felt like a home anyway. Even with his grandfather's kindness, it just wasn't enough to make me feel like more than a guest.Every item I folded, every drawer I emptied, felt like I was closing a chapter of my life that had long ago lost its meaning.I was so lost in the task at hand that I didn't even hear the door open.""Well, well, well"" came the sharp, condescending voice of Marian Grayson, Carter's mother. ""If it isn't the little gold digger, packing her things.""I froze, a surge of bitterness rising within me.Marian had always looked at me as though I was beneath her, as though I had somehow tricked her precious son into marrying me for the wealth his family possessed.I had never been good enough for her and for years, I had to tolerate her hatred.""What do you want, Marian?"" I asked, keeping my back turned, my voice steady despite the anger bubbling up inside me. ""I'm finally leaving, aren't I?""""Leaving?"" She scoffed, stepping closer with an air of superiority.""Of course, you are. You've had your fun, haven't you? So you can go to hell for all I care. But don't think you can just walk away with everything‚Äù.What is this woman talking about now?Her eyes rested suspiciously on my bag. ‚ÄúWhat do you have in those hefty bags? I don't remember them being that heavily loaded when you moved in. What did you take? Something valuable, perhaps?""Her words stung, but I told myself I wouldn't let her get to me anymore.I had spent years letting her control the narrative of my life, letting her judge me from the sidelines. But not today.I turned to face her, irritation resting on my face. ""I've filed for divorce from Carter,"" I said calmly, the words feeling almost foreign on my tongue, but freeing nonetheless.For a moment, Marian looked stunned, her sharp features softening with a hint of surprise.But then, a smile tugged at the corner of her lips, one that didn't reach her eyes. ""Oh, I'm sure that's for the best,"" she said as if she had been expecting this for a long time.But then, her gaze dropped to my suitcase, and the smile faltered. ""But don't even think that will distract me from what's happening. You didn't pack just clothes, did you? That's why you're trying to stall.""I felt a flash of anger, but I didn't let it show.Marian's voice had a venomous edge like she was trying to find something to accuse me of.I knew exactly what she was looking for.She immediately signalled her maid whom I hadn't noticed until now.‚ÄúEmpty that suitcase. I know she had taken something valuable‚Äù.I watched as the servant stepped forward, unzipping the suitcase and rummaging through it.I watched as she carefully pulled out my grandmother's belongings, including the bracelet. I could feel the sting of Marian's glare, and it made my chest tighten.‚ÄúI already told you.These are all my belongings,‚Äù I sighed, annoyed I was going to have to repack everything.Marian, of course, found something to capitalise on.""That bracelet,"" Marian said, her voice taking on a sharper edge, ""was bought by Carter. It belongs to the Grayson family now. You're not taking it with you.""I almost laughed at the absurdity of it.Of course, she would claim that.She was always so quick to stake her claim on anything that had to do with Carter or the Grayson name.""This bracelet was my grandmothers,"" I said, my voice quiet but firm. ""And I'm taking it with me.""Marian's mouth opened to argue, but before she could speak, I heard the sound of the front door opening.Carter's voice rang out, but it was strained, weary.I turned as he stepped into the room, his eyes scanning the scene. His gaze fell on me, and then it shifted to Marian, standing beside the suitcase.""What's going on?""Carter asked, his voice tense.I felt a coldness in my chest. Here was Carter‚Äîthe man who had never truly known me, the man who had always been too busy with his work, too distracted by everything else, to see what was right in front of him.What was he doing here so early anyway? Didn't he have work to do?‚ÄúYour mother is being dramatic. She is bent on causing a scene,‚Äù I answered coldly and he was taken aback.He had gotten so used to my sweet pushover nature that he didn't think there were other sides of me.‚ÄúDramatic?‚Äù Marian huffed.‚ÄúThis gold digger is trying to leave with our valuables! She thinks she can still keep the gifts given to her while you both are still together‚Äù.I crossed the room, standing before him, my emotions swirling like a storm. ""Carter,"" I said, my voice shaking with everything I had been holding back.""I want to know. Did you ever, even once, buy me a gift? A real gift. Something that showed you knew me, that you cared enough to understand me?""Carter's brow furrowed. He looked taken aback, his eyes searching mine. But there was something else there‚Äîsomething I couldn't quite place.He didn't have an answer to that, of course, because in truth, he had never gotten me a gift. Not even once.I began feeling nauseous and let out a sneeze before I could stop it. Then my eyes flickered down to the bouquet of lilies in his hand. Is that for me?I couldn't help it. A laugh, bitter and sharp, bubbled out of me.It wasn't funny. Not really. But it was everything.It was the culmination of years of feeling invisible, of being so far removed from Carter's true affections that I had become a ghost in our own life together.‚ÄúYou brought lilies?‚Äù I scoffed in disbelief.‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù He retorted.""You really don't know, do you?"" I whispered through the laughter, the sting of tears threatening.""Three years, Carter. We've been married for three years, and you didn't even know that I'm allergic to lilies.""I wiped at my eyes, a mix of anger and sorrow welling inside me.Something flickered in his eyes but I didn't care to know what it was. I turned to Marian.‚ÄúMaybe you should go ahead and ask your son. I mean, look at him. How could he even gift me a bracelet when he doesn't even know the basic things about me? After three years of marriage, the first set of flowers he brings home is a bunch of lilies, which his wife is allergic to. Maybe you can be the judge now and tell me if you really think he has ever considered giving me anything‚Äù.Carter had an embarrassed look on his face when I finished.This was surprising to me though cause the Carter I know, rarely let his emotions show.I took a deep breath and stared at the mother and son.""You fucking bitches,"" I muttered in my mindChapter 6RegretsVeronica's POVHis face was flustered and red with embarrassment, confirming how right I was. My heart squeezed tightly as the truth became clearer by the minute.This man didn't make any effort to know me, even after seven years as his secretary and three years as his wife.‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt for you,‚Äù Carter muttered, pushing them behind him immediately to prove that he was lying. He couldn‚Äôt even look at me, his usual confidence slipping like sand through his fingers. ‚ÄúI... I bought them for my mother.‚ÄùI nearly laughed, the bitterness rising in my throat like bile. Of course you did.‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said, my voice cold and flat. ‚ÄúYour mother.‚ÄùThere was no warmth in the silence that followed‚Äîjust the tension of a thousand unsaid words hanging between us. I folded my arms, holding myself tightly as if the act could keep me from breaking.‚ÄúMom, the bracelet belongs to Veronica. I didn't buy it for her,‚Äù Carter said to Marian but the woman still didn't look like she believed us.‚ÄúCarter, you don't have to cover up for this woman‚Ä¶‚Äù she started saying but he cut her short.‚ÄúI am not covering up for anyone. Veronica has had that bracelet way before we got married. Hand it over to her please,‚Äù he said and that seemed to convince her.Reluctantly, Marian handed over the bracelet to me and I received it with grace. Finally! I couldn't wait to leave this suffocating place.‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I said curtly, tucking it in my bag.‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Marian said, her lips curling into a smile that didn‚Äôt reach her eyes, ‚Äúit seems this little misunderstanding is over. You can leave now, Veronica.‚ÄùLeave.Even though it was the very freedom I needed, it hurt to think that they could dismiss me so quicky.I reached into my bag and pulled out the papers‚Äîtwo crisp sheets that felt heavier than they should have. The divorce agreement and my resignation letter. My ticket out of this nightmare.I sucked in a deep breath, reminding myself that this was the right thing to do, no matter how much it hurt.‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I said, holding them out. ‚ÄúThis is all you need from me.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Carter added and I strugged.‚ÄúYou'll see.‚ÄùBut before I could turn and walk away, I felt it‚Äîa hand grabbing my wrist, stopping me mid-step. Carter.‚ÄúVeronica,‚Äù he said, his voice low and urgent, ‚ÄúThis is a very big decision to just make out of the blue, you can‚Äôt just leave like this. You need to tell Grandfather. You know how much he likes you. Leaving like this will crush him.‚ÄùRight! Of course he was worried about his grandfather's reaction.Master Grayson. The only member of his family who had ever been kind to me, the man who had treated me like a granddaughter when no one else did. For a moment, guilt wavered in my chest, but I shoved it aside.‚ÄúI‚Äôll find time,‚Äù I replied, keeping my tone cool, ‚Äúto talk to him myself.‚ÄùCarter‚Äôs grip tightened, his knuckles going white. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not good enough. I‚Äôm not signing this.‚Äù He shook the papers in his free hand. ‚ÄúThe company still needs you. I still‚Ä¶‚ÄùI let out a loud and bitter laugh. Wow! This was more than interesting. He was chasing me because he still wanted to enslave me at the company so he could flaunt his first love more in my face.‚ÄúThe company? Last time I checked, you had your sweet little Meghan by your side. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll be a great help to you, now that she‚Äôs carrying your child.‚ÄùHis face paled, and for a split second, he looked almost guilty. Good.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúWhat it looks like?‚Äù I cut him off, my words laced with venom. ‚ÄúOh, right. I must be misunderstanding everything because I'm just plain stupid right?‚Äù‚ÄúVeronica, listen to me.‚ÄùBut Marian stepped in then, her voice chiming over his like a bell. ‚ÄúOh, Carter, let her go. Meghan is a lovely girl, and we‚Äôre more than happy to have her as part of this family.‚ÄùI turned to Marian slowly, my lip curling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you are.‚ÄùCarter tried again, his voice breaking with something I didn‚Äôt care to name. ‚ÄúIt was an accident. Meghan‚Äôs pregnancy‚Äî‚Äù‚ÄúAn accident?‚Äù I repeated, cutting him off. The word stung, reverberating in my chest like an old wound ripping open. ‚ÄúThe way you explain things, Carter, everything‚Äôs just one big accident, isn‚Äôt it? And you expect me to believe that, don't you? Yet you've never believed that what happened between us three years ago was an accident as well.‚ÄùThe room went silent. Carter looked stricken, like I‚Äôd just slapped him. Maybe I should have. It would have been a good way to release most of the pain clawing me inside.I didn‚Äôt give him a chance to respond. I turned on my heel, yanking my wrist free of his grip. My steps echoed through the room as I walked away, but his voice chased after me.‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt live without me, Veronica!‚Äù he called, his voice desperate, breaking at the edges. ‚ÄúYou'll surely come running back, I promise you that!‚ÄùThe words hit me like the truck. The audacity of this man.‚ÄúYou have no where to go, Veronica. Without me, you are lost,‚Äù he said.I guess this is what you get when you put your life on hold for someone. They suddenly think that without them, you are nothing. I was so going to prove this man wrong.I stopped just long enough to look back, meeting his eyes with all the cold anger I could summon. ‚ÄúWatch me.‚ÄùAnd then I walked out.The moment the front door closed behind me, I let out a shaky breath. My chest felt heavy, my hands trembling.So many emotions were swirling inside me. Anger, pain, frustration.I could never go back. Not now. Not ever.

As the executive secretary to the president, she had held this position since her graduation. Her parents, including her father who was once the right-hand man of Se√±or San Miguel, perished in an accident that left Se√±or San Miguel disabled.

Following the tragedy, he took on the responsibility of her education and placed her in a boarding school, where she graduated with honors. Despite tempting offers from other companies, Ericka chose to stay loyal to the San Miguel family due to a sense of gratitude. Initially thinking she would be the personal assistant to Se√±or, her fate changed when Monte, Se√±or's eldest grandson, selected her. There was a mysterious attraction she felt, perhaps stemming from a crush since their school days. Monte had always defended her from bullies, earning him the nickname ""popper fish"" due to his unique traits.

She took another look in the mirror, revealing a stern expression. Satisfied, she headed out, each step resonating on the staircase. Ericka proceeded straight to the kitchen.

""Ah, Miss Ericka, i'm so sorry, we do not change the bed sheet. I did not know that you're coming back,"" explained Nanang Perlita.

""I was also surprised when Sir Monte picked me up last night. He mentioned it's more convenient for us to be under the same roof so he can easily ask me questions or vice versa. Besides, he said I really live here, this is my house too,"" she clarified.

The older woman teased, ""Maybe you still have a crush on him, huh?""

""This is purely work-related, Nanay,"" Ericka responded.

""Ericka..."" they heard the call from the elderly San Miguel.

""Oh, it's you, sir,"" she smiled, approaching to bow. ""Allow me to push your wheelchair.""

She guided him to the center of the table. She signaled Nanay Perlita to start serving.

""How are you, hija?"" he asked.

""I'm good. Getting beautiful... hahaha,"" they shared a laugh at her joke.

""Your term is incorrect. It's not just getting beautiful; it should be getting even more beautiful,"" he corrected playfully.

""You and your jokes,"" she chuckled. ""How are you, sir?""

""I'm glad you're back home; at least, I have someone sensible to talk to. Monte is always busy with work. I think he was surprised to realize that he's truly taking over the company, and I won't be involved anymore.""

""I could have stayed elsewhere, i have my home, but sir insisted,"" Ericka explained.

""I personally asked him to bring you back here.""

She felt a sudden sadness, realizing it wasn't Monte who wanted her back.Indeed the man seemed oblivious to others' feelings.

""I would have been content at my own home, Se√±or. Yet here I am, letting you feed me again. I eat a lot, you know.""

""That's fine, hija. I'm used to you eating a lot, hahaha,"" Se√±or chuckled.

""Coffee?""

""Yes, please, and make it your way. I've had enough of Perlita's inconsistent brew.""

Ericka briefly left the elderly man. As she entered the dirty kitchen near the sink, she overheard a conversation between an older house helper and Leona, the new helper.

""It's true that she's the se√±or's daughter."" the elderly helper said with envy in her tone.

""Ow?, some say she's the se√±or's mistress,"" replied Leona.

""Her mother is the se√±or's mistress; that's why she's always around. She didn't finish school but got hired as a secretary. I guess her mother's beautiful looks played a part.""

""Sir Monte is her boss now, right?""

""She wants to seduce him to become wealthy.""

""So, she's flirtatious?""

""Yes, she is...""

""Eheeem.."" their conversation was abruptly interrupted, and they both looked surprised.

""Uhm... Have you been there the whole time, Ericka?"" Manang Lorie recognized her.

Manang Lorie worked alongside Ericka's mother and, being naturally intelligent, became the se√±or's secretary. The rumors about Ericka's mother being the se√±or's mistress had circulated for a long time, but they chose not to entertain such issues. For her parents and the se√±or, such stories were superficial. Perhaps that mindset still persisted today. She felt Manang Lorie's intense gaze, sensing that she was being judged.

""Not really... I just arrived,"" she smiled at them, grabbing the coffee condiments.

""I'll do it, Miss Ericka,"" Leona offered.

""Don't call me Miss... we all receive the same salary here,"" Ericka replied.

""The se√±or might get upset,"" warned Leona.

""Even Manang Lorie just calls me Ericka. You can do the same, or maybe 'ate' so you'll feel more comfortable, as I'm staying here again.""

""Huh? You're coming back?"" Manang Lorie asked.

""Yes, is that okay with you?"" Ericka faced them.

""Well, um, yes. I'm happy that you're coming back.""

""I'll just bring this to the se√±or. He prefers the taste of my coffee.""

As she turned away, she caught a glimpse, out of the corner of her eye, of the two whispering. She promised herself she would talk to them later. Her once peaceful parents' lives were disturbed by idle people. If only she could wake them up and make the household staff realize the truth.

She found Se√±or and Monte engrossed in what seemed like a serious conversation. They glanced at her as her heels tapped on the wooden floor. Se√±or's face was shadowed, a sign that he might not be pleased with whatever he and Monte were discussing.



POV: Monte

His grandfather wanted him and Almira to get married, unaware that they were no longer together. This morning, as he descended, he heard his grandfather asking Ericka to prepare coffee. He approached when the woman left.

""Good morning, Lolo,"" he said, taking a seat beside him.

""How was your sleep in your own house?"" his grandfather teased.

""Lolo, I came back, and your question sounds sarcastic.""

""You're too sensitive,"" his grandfather chuckled, ruffling his hair. ""Coffee?""

""You're already having Ericka prepare it; she probably brought a thermos.""

""When is your wedding with Almira?""

""Lolo, I'm not ready to get married.""

""You're at the right age, Monte. I want to see some little ones running around before I leave this world.""

""What if I just adopt?"" he joked.

""Ah, this kid is crazy,"" his grandfather playfully slapped his hand. ""That's not good.""

""Just kidding.""

""I want Almira. You've been dating her since college, and she comes from a prominent family. It would be better if you marry her. She's beautiful, and your children will surely be stunning.""

""Oh no, lolo, are we dogs that need to be bred?""

""You're really philosophical, Monte. Perhaps you're like that in the office too. How will your subordinates respect you if you're like that?""

""I'm different with you. You're the only one I can be affectionate with."" Since his sister's disappearance, he became distant from people. Even with Ericka, their conversations were strictly business.

Almira's family had many connections, especially in politics. However, he wasn't ready for marriage, and Almira was not the one he wanted as a wife. He was still investigating what truly happened to his sister, and he felt Almira was somehow involved.

Their conversation halted as they heard the sound of Ericka's heels. They turned to look at her, and Monte wondered about her peculiar attire-long skirt and raised hair, making him curious about its length.

This quiet person seemed to have changed. Montana often observed them at the office, always with a smile now. His contemplation was interrupted when he was called by Se√±or.

""Will you have coffee, Monte? Ericka has been asking you for a while now,"" the old man tapped him.

""Yes, please,"" he replied, avoiding eye contact. Did she notice that he was looking at her? Embarrassing, he hoped she wouldn't think he was being inappropriate.

""Any creamer?"" the woman asked.

""Half a teaspoon,"" he responded.

As the food arrived, they were surprised by the abundance. Even Ericka seemed taken aback.

""Se√±or, do we have a visitor?"" Ericka asked.

""No, hija, it's your first day, so I prepared your favorite dishes. I'm sure you don't get to cook like this at home,"" Se√±or said with a smile.

""Oh, I might gain too much weight here...""

""That's okay; you'll still be beautiful even if you gain weight.""

They laughed together, and Montana, just observing, could easily mistake them for a father and daughter. If he didn't know them and his grandfather, he might believe the rumors he hears. But he knows his grandfather deeply loved his late grandmother. After her death, he rarely saw his grandfather at home; he went straight to the cemetery after work.

""Oh, Monte, something's wrong?"" Se√±or asked.

""Nothing, Lolo... let's eat,"" he said, slightly embarrassed. He let the two go first and get their food before he did.

Having home-cooked meals is truly something he missed. He initially resisted returning home to avoid memories of his younger sister, but his grandfather's affection convinced him to come back.

He realized that his grandfather, in old age, seemed to seek the care of loved ones. His mother was alone, and his father was no longer in their lives, leaving them with few close relatives. While he had second cousins, he rarely interacted with them as most were abroad. He mainly conversed with friends.

Ericka thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp dish. If she didn't have a napkin on her clothes, they might be stained with moisture. She laughed because his grandfather imitated her. She smiled when Se√±or asked where she learned such table manners.

When his grandfather suggested Monte try it too, he attempted to eat with his hands. However, he noticed this woman was different, and he found himself noticing many things about her. Although she wasn't his usual type, there seemed to be a unique attraction. He excused himself, Ericka offered to go with him, he refused to and asked her to finish eating.

As he left, he saw Mang Turing tending to the car.

""What happened?"" he asked the elderly man with his back turned.

""Senyorito, it's you. There's an oil leak; it needs to be taken to the casa.""

The enemy's howls grew louder as I neared the river, my only hope of escape. The roar of the water drowned out the wolves, but they were right behind me.

A loud growl behind me caused me to lose my footing and I rolled off the cliff. Looking up, I saw the eyes of the wolf who had betrayed me and slaughtered my pack, the man I once trusted. Before my body could hit the icy water below, I shook awake.

‚ÄúIt was only a nightmare.‚Äù I breathed out, trying to catch my breath. No matter how hard I try, that day will forever haunt my dreams.

Looking at the clock beside my bed, I groaned. I was due to get up in half an hour. With no chance of going back to sleep, I threw off my blanket and climbed out of bed. My body was stiff and sore from the tension of my dream but I needed to work off this anxious energy. Before dressing for my morning run, I left my room and walked down the hallway to peek into my son‚Äôs room. I let out a silent sigh of relief when I found he was still asleep. He was safe and that‚Äôs all that mattered.

I quietly went back to my room to get changed for my early morning run. When I was dressed, I put in my earbuds and started my music before pocketing my phone. Leaving the house, I made sure to lock the door. I had my wolf to protect me but my son wasn‚Äôt old enough to shift yet.

I had run a lap around the neighborhood before Channing, my son, joined me. We did this every morning before he went to school and I went to work. I was still so lost in my nightmare of last night. The run did nothing to ease my anxiety.

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt sleep?‚Äù He asked when I removed one of the earbuds.

‚ÄúI woke up early and decided to get an extra lap in,‚Äù I told him. He gave me a nod and we ran in comfortable silence. We didn‚Äôt need to speak to enjoy each other‚Äôs company.

Unlike most parents, I don‚Äôt keep secrets from him. He knows about his father and why he isn‚Äôt in our lives. His father is also my fated mate. And even though I was only seventeen and unmarked, I still got pregnant. It was my first time. And it was only after I had run did I found out I was pregnant. That‚Äôs when I knew he was my fated mate.

He was also only seventeen at the time and wouldn‚Äôt have known I was his fated. He probably still doesn‚Äôt. The last I heard was he had found his Luna a few months after the attack and they have a son. Not that his life has anything to do with mine. I may despise my mate but I love my son with everything I have. Even though life in a human city hasn‚Äôt been easy, keeping him was the best decision I ever made.

‚ÄúMom, are you sure everything is okay?‚Äù Channing asked me as I handed him a bottle of water. We had finished a lap together before heading home to get ready for our day.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, sweetie. And it‚Äôs my job to worry about you,‚Äù I scolded with a smirk.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a seventeen-year-old high school student, what‚Äôs there to worry about?‚Äù He chuckled.

‚ÄúOne, if you don‚Äôt start getting ready, you‚Äôll be late for school.‚Äù

He cursed when he looked at the clock on the stove. He took off upstairs, leaving me in the kitchen, chuckling and shaking my head. I quickly followed his lead, I needed to get ready so I could drop him at school before I headed to the office.

It never takes me long to get ready. I keep it work formal but I would rather work from home in my pajamas. After I showered, I styled my shoulder-length blonde hair, letting it dry in waves. Applying very little makeup, I didn‚Äôt go to work to impress anyone, I was there to make sure my son had everything he needed and more. I do enjoy my job and I‚Äôve worked hard to be where I‚Äôm at but it wasn‚Äôt my life.

When I was ready, Channing was waiting at the front door for me. The school year only had a few more weeks and then it would be just us for the summer. I was planning on taking some time off before his last year of high school and his hockey season started. Life was always busy for us so I needed to slow down and enjoy the time I had left before he went off to college.

‚ÄúReady?‚Äù He asked, handing me my bags.

‚ÄúYep, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

**Chapter 2**

Ryley

My boss was standing by the front desk as soon as I stepped out of the elevator, holding my much-needed latte. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to deal with him today. I just wanted to get to my office and finish my workload. He was chatting with the receptionist, Marcy. My strides became more purposeful as I made my way to my office, trying to go unnoticed.

‚ÄúGood morning, Miss Halliwell,‚Äù Marcy‚Äôs overly cheery voice rang out when I was almost in the safety of my office. I cringed before forcing a smile. I turned around to see my boss, Mr. Miller, and Marcy, both watching me.

‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù I told them, trying to sound chipper, even though I was anything but. I turned on my heels and headed into my office, closing the door behind me.

The relief I felt after closing my door and I was alone was short-lived when Mr. Miller, opened the door and entered my office. I silently groaned as I placed my latte on my desk before placing my purse and bag on the floor beside my chair.

‚ÄúMr. Miller, what can I do for you?‚Äù I asked him, as I removed my coat, placing it over the back of my chair.

Mr. Isaac Miller was a few years older than me. He took over for his father a few years ago when he decided to retire and spend his golden years traveling with his wife. He wasn‚Äôt a werewolf but his sister was mated to one, which is uncommon. It helped him build his accounting firm. He was trusted in the werewolf community because his sister was associated with the firm. And she was mated to a wolf. He also has some great forensic accountants working for him.

‚ÄúRyley, I need a favor,‚Äù He said, sitting in a chair in front of my desk. My body froze as I looked at him. Whenever I hear those words, my mind automatically goes to a date. If I had a dollar for the number of times I‚Äôve been asked to make another woman jealous, I wouldn‚Äôt need to work anymore.

‚ÄúWhat kind of favor?‚Äù I asked him, suspiciously, and he let out a sigh. It‚Äôs too early for this and I haven‚Äôt even enjoyed my coffee, I thought as I took my seat.

‚ÄúDo you remember the Orion Enterprise case, I had asked you to investigate?‚Äù I remember that case drove me crazy for twenty-four full hours until I finally figured it out. The person who was stealing was good at hiding their tracks but I was better.

‚ÄúYes, I remember. Did something happen?‚Äù I asked him.

‚ÄúI need you to travel to the Orion pack.‚Äù He said. Unfortunately for me, his brother-in-law scented me when I met him and his mate at a work function.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I told him firmly. I won‚Äôt go into packs. I‚Äôm a lone wolf and I don‚Äôt need that kind of drama. If I was from a lower bloodline, I would be considered a rogue but it's not uncommon for a strong wolf to not want to submit under an alpha. I‚Äôm one of those wolves.

‚ÄúRyley, I wouldn‚Äôt be asking if it wasn‚Äôt important. Mr. Orion suspects more fraud is happening within his empire and has demanded I send the person who found the person the first time. You saved his enterprise almost a million dollars.‚Äù He explained as I sipped my coffee.

‚ÄúYou know I have Channing. I can‚Äôt just uproot our lives. He has school and hockey.‚Äù I told him.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt school almost done for the year? And it may be nice for him to be with his own kind,‚Äù he commented and I raised a brow.

‚ÄúYou know what I mean, Ryley,‚Äù he said, shaking his head.

‚ÄúYes, I know what you mean. But I have my reason for keeping me and my son away from that life.‚Äù He sighed as he ran his hand down his face.

‚ÄúHe is one of our wealthiest clients. I need my best on this.‚Äù

‚ÄúFlattery will get you nowhere, Isaac. This isn‚Äôt just my life. And school may be done soon but what about next year? It will be Channing‚Äôs last year, I want him to graduate with his friends.‚Äù I told him.

‚ÄúWhat if it's just for the summer? And I‚Äôll give you a bonus now and one at the end of the summer.‚Äù He pleaded.

‚ÄúIf I do this, Isaac, Channing, and I need our own home. I won‚Äôt stay at their pack house. I will need my own office, and weekends and all the other days I request are guaranteed off. This is one of the last summers I have with Channing, and I won't be wasting it. Also, I will only answer to you. Mr. Orion doesn‚Äôt hold any authority over me. I will respect his pack rules but I won't be forced to submit. And I won‚Äôt start until after school is done for the year.‚Äù When I was done explaining my demands, Mr. Miller had a grin on his face. He‚Äôd be handsome if he wasn‚Äôt my boss.

‚ÄúDone,‚Äù He exclaimed, standing up.

‚ÄúOh, and Isaac, I‚Äôll need my first bonus in the form of a teal green sports car,‚Äù I called out before he could leave my office.

‚ÄúSend me a picture and the specs. I‚Äôll send over all the documents Mr. Orion has sent to me, so you can get started. Thank you, Ryley.‚Äù He said before leaving my office, closing the door behind him. I slumped back into my chair, groaning.

Channing will be getting his dream car, but is it worth going back into a world I ran from seventeen years ago?

‚ÄúThis could be good for him. He‚Äôll be able to train and interact with others just like him.‚Äù Lily, my wolf said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to keep him safe. We are a Luna wolf; I won‚Äôt be forced to submit. I let someone get close to me and look at what happened to our family and pack. I can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt lose Channing.‚Äù I sighed.

‚ÄúI will do everything I can to keep our pup safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you will. You‚Äôd kill an alpha if you had to. I just don‚Äôt want things to come to that. I don‚Äôt want to have to deal with a council that turned their backs on my family. It‚Äôs better if everyone thinks the future Luna of the Aurora Mountain pack is still dead.‚Äù

**Chapter 3**

Alpha Blake

It‚Äôs been of a couple of weeks. After noticing some of the accounts weren‚Äôt adding up, I sent an email to my friend Isaac. Isaac Miller and I have been friends for a few years after one of my warriors was mated to his human sister. It‚Äôs not uncommon for a wolf to be mated to a human, even though our worlds are pretty separate. We don‚Äôt go around announcing we are wolves to just anyone.

I was surprised when within twenty-four hours, Isaac‚Äôs firm had already located the problem and tracked down the source. Isaac had some of the country's best accountants working for him. After tracking down the person who had stolen almost a million dollars from me, I asked Isaac to send the person who had uncovered the culprit. I wanted all of our finances reviewed. It‚Äôs one thing to steal from me, but no one steals from my pack and gets away with it.

I was relieved when my cell phone rang and Isaac‚Äôs name popped up on the screen. When we last spoke, he seemed hesitant to ask the person to relocate to my pack. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs human, but he has nothing to worry about. I have other humans in my pack.

‚ÄúBlake Orion,‚Äù I answered.

‚ÄúHey Blake, it's Isaac.‚Äù He greeted.

‚ÄúIsaac, I hope you are calling with good news,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúMy employee has made some requests.‚Äù He said and I rolled my eyes. Of course, they would make demands, even though I offered a sizeable bonus. Plus all accommodations will be paid.

‚ÄúAnd what are these demands?‚Äù I questioned.

‚ÄúA house to live in away from the pack house. Their own office, weekends, and all requested time off. And everything has to be done by the end of the summer.‚Äù He explained. I was more surprised by the lack of demands themself.

‚ÄúHow big does the house have to be?‚Äù I asked, knowing already where I would house him.

‚ÄúThey have a teenage son, so at least two bedrooms,‚Äù Isaac answered.

‚ÄúNo wife?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the two of them. School is almost done for the year. After they will relocate for the summer until the next school year starts.‚Äù That sounded reasonable. I wouldn‚Äôt want to pull my son out of school with just a couple of weeks left.

‚ÄúI agree to those terms.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood to hear. I‚Äôll send over the exact date of their arrival after I give them the good news. And Blake, if you have any issues, please bring them to my attention and I will handle the situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill do, thanks again,‚Äù I said before ending the call. I wonder what issues he was referring to.

‚ÄúDad, who was that?‚Äù My son, Aspen asked, walking into my office. He was the spitting image of me but with his late mother‚Äôs, my fated mate's eyes. It reminds me, I always have a piece of her.

‚ÄúI finished my exam. I have a few hours until the next one.‚Äù He shrugged, taking a seat.

‚ÄúWe will be having a couple of humans as our guests for the summer. The forensic accountant and his son.‚Äù I told him.

‚ÄúStill worried there‚Äôs another thief among the companies?‚Äù

‚ÄúOne can never be too careful, son. I employed hundreds of people. If someone was able to get through our security, I‚Äôm sure others will try or are trying. It‚Äôs not like people don‚Äôt know how wealthy we are.‚Äù I sighed.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs bad about being an alpha‚Äôs son. You never really know who is your friend. And the girls only care about being Luna. It‚Äôs exhausting.‚Äù He confessed.

‚ÄúWhy do you think I never remated? No one could replace your mother, for one, but then all the woman wanted was to be Luna. They didn‚Äôt want a single dad. It was just easier to raise you myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you will get a second chance?‚Äù He shrugged.

‚ÄúAnd how do you feel about that?‚Äù I asked him. I know he missed his mother, I did every day. I don‚Äôt want him to feel I‚Äôm replacing her or him.

‚ÄúIt would be nice to see you happy again. And I‚Äôll be going off to alpha training next year. I just want to make sure you are taken care of.‚Äù He said and I sighed.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm the parent here. Shouldn‚Äôt I be worried about you?‚Äù I gave him a pointed look and he chuckled.

‚ÄúI would be less worried if you didn‚Äôt work so much. You need to get a hobby outside the pack businesses. Once I take over you will have a lot of free time on your hands.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, is that how it is? Just going to throw your old man out on his ass?‚Äù

‚ÄúI would feel better if you had a woman to keep you company.‚Äù He grinned.

‚ÄúScram. Don‚Äôt you have an exam to study for?‚Äù I grumbled, looking back at my paperwork.

‚ÄúMaybe, but you should think about what I said. You could have a second chance out there. I just don‚Äôt want to see you a lonely old man.‚Äù He teased.

‚ÄúGo study before I put you to work,‚Äù I retorted.

‚ÄúYes, Alpha, sir, ‚Äú he saluted me, before leaving my office. He left me shaking my head at his antics.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right you know, it may be worth it to visit other packs to see if we do have a second chance,‚Äù Gunner, my wolf, chimed in.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I feel like I‚Äôd be cheating on Mia. She died giving us Aspen and then I just move on to someone else.‚Äù I sighed.

‚ÄúShe would want us to be happy. She understood the risk of her bringing our son into the world and she still took that chance.‚Äù He retorted.

‚ÄúBecause she lied to me about those risks, until it was too late. I love Aspen but I never would have allowed her to risk her life like that. We could have adopted.‚Äù I exclaimed. He whimpered while retreating and my stomach twisted painfully with guilt. He too lost his mate that day. My son‚Äôs birth was the happiest and saddest day of my life. And second chance or not, no one can replace Mia.

**Chapter 4**

Ryley

I was finishing stuffing my clothes into my last suitcase. The last two weeks flew by and it's now the day we leave our home for the summer. Channing was over the moon when Mr. Miller delivered my bonus personally. And even though I was happy to give my son something he‚Äôs been wanting and working hard for, my stomach twisted painfully. If I‚Äôm discovered, there will be no coming back. I‚Äôd been running from that life for seventeen years and now I was about to move into the wolf‚Äôs den.

I sighed as I placed the suitcase on the floor and sat down on the edge of my bed. I regretted my decision as soon as I accepted Mr. Millers' offer. And I was hoping Alpha Orion wouldn‚Äôt agree to my demands. So imagine my disappointment when Isaac came back to my office later that day to get the exact date of when we could relocate and the details for the car. I should have been more demanding. I know The Orion pack is wealthy and I should have used that, But I wasn‚Äôt that person to demand money. It wasn‚Äôt about the money, it was about my simple life with my son.

I took in a deep breath as I tried to swallow down my fears.

‚ÄúMom, you ready?‚Äù Channing asked from the doorway of my bedroom.

‚ÄúReady,‚Äù I answered, taking another deep breath.

‚ÄúEverything will be fine, Mom. I won't let anything happen to you,‚Äù Channing said, giving me a side hug, as I stood up from the bed.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not me I‚Äôm worried about. And I‚Äôm the parent here. I should be reassuring you.‚Äù I told him and he chuckled.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll always have your back, Mom. I‚Äôll take your bag out and you can lock up the house,‚Äù he squeezed me tight before picking up my suitcase and leaving my room. Channing has always been the boy to see the glass as half full and never half empty. He was so full of life and enjoyed the unknown. I, on the other hand, feared not knowing. The last seventeen years have always been me not knowing how I was going to feed him, clothe him, or even how I was going to pay rent. I liked being in control.

I spent a few minutes going into every room to make sure nothing was forgotten. When I was satisfied everything was either off or locked, I locked the front door. Channing was already sitting behind the wheel of his car with the music blaring. I made eye contact with him before climbing behind the wheel of my SUV. It was packed full of all of our things. After finding a song I like, I started the four-hour drive with Channing following behind me. The further I drove from home, the house I worked so hard to buy, the further my stomach sunk. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something bad was about to happen.

I was thankful my windows were heavily tinted as I pulled up in front of the Orion‚Äôs pack house. I needed a moment to gather myself and to calm my nerves before exposing who I was. A lone wolf. I was in the middle of deep breathing when my phone rang through the speakers. Blowing out a breath, I answered.

‚ÄúRyley Halliwell.‚Äô

‚ÄúMiss Halliwell, this is Mr. Dillinger. I need your help with a matter of a personal nature.‚Äù He said. I had worked on his accounts before, for his company, but never personal.

‚ÄúOf course, Mr. Dillinger, what can I do for you?‚Äù I asked him.

‚ÄúI need you to go over my personal finances. I believe my wife isn‚Äôt being truthful and I need to prove it.‚Äù He sighed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm already on a case but if you could email everything you‚Äôd like me to review, I can try to get it back to you by Monday evening,‚Äù I told him.

‚ÄúThank you, Miss Halliwell. Mr. Miller told me you were relocating for the summer and offered for someone else to handle this matter but I trust you. I know you are the best.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you for your trust and understanding. I‚Äôm sorry for your circumstances,‚Äù I told him, sincerely. I only know him professionally, but he seems like a good man. He pays his employees well. And the turnover of his employees is very low. He can‚Äôt be that bad if his employees are loyal.

‚ÄúKeep me posted.‚Äù He said before ending the call.

I‚Äôm never getting any sleep this weekend. I sent Isaac a text to let him know that I would be looking into the matter for Mr. Dillinger. My phone chimed, alerting me to an unread email. Mr. Dillinger had sent me over everything he wanted me to review.

I placed my phone in the center console before going back to my breathing.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get this over with,‚Äù I breathed out before opening the door and stepping out of my SUV.

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Andre Mackenzie, PhD Student***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 22nd, 2125*

I‚Äôd lost track of the number of times I was grateful for my synthetic voicebox.

Standing around and talking about the same thing over and over for hours would‚Äôve killed my old larynx. Then again, it would‚Äôve been well-practiced from all the tours I‚Äôve gone on.

I‚Äôd attended conferences before, but this was my first time actually presenting at one. *The North American Society of Cybernetics Engineering Conference*. This particular event was officially a conference, but was really more half-convention.

My presentation area, a humble little desk I‚Äôd been assigned, had a few computer screens displaying some of my other prototype modeling work. But most notably, the desk displayed my mostly-working arm. It was a frankenstein of a model, complete with wires jutting out of it and blocky placeholder components oriented in odd angles. It was about as eye-catching as one could expect at a place like this, and plenty of people came to have a look.

‚ÄúIncredible! Does it feel different from a normal limb?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you planning on making your own company?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you design them yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, you‚Äôre that guy from the movie?‚Äù

The answer to all of those questions was yes, but in long-form. Sometimes *very* long-form. I‚Äôd have the occasional professor or other kind of really smart person come around and ask about something deeper than surface level (literally). I‚Äôd mostly come to this conference because I thought it‚Äôd be very helpful to get some opinions from other professionals in the field. In that respect it was‚Ä¶ marginally helpful. I learned a little about cooling and a few ways I could streamline power distribution.

But most people saw me, *Macks Damage*, and pursued the most immediate line of questioning that came with that title. Everyone wanted to know how I was nearly obliterated and put back together. It was still very fun, if slightly disappointing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine most days,‚Äù I said, answering a question I‚Äôd been asked a dozen times by now. At least the person asking it looked to be one of the last that had been slowly filtering out. My time slot ending coincided with the end of the conference‚Äôs second day, which meant I was free. ‚ÄúBut it could be a lot better. I‚Äôm planning to make a whole new set of *everything*.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven your eyeballs?‚Äù they sarcastically asked.

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I deadpanned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna put a heads-up-display in them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa. So you could, like, see my body temperature and stuff?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúDoubt I‚Äôd use it for organic material very often, but sure.‚Äù

They paused, taking another sweeping look at my limbs. ‚ÄúThis is *so* cool. Wish I could ask more questions, but I have to go and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre also busy. You‚Äôll still be here tomorrow, right?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúProbably.‚Äù

They beamed a response and a goodbye, and took off. I packed up my humble table of its tools and cleaned up. I slipped my prototype limb into its ‚Äúspecial‚Äù case. That was also on my long list of things to improve. It felt wrong to have this hugely complex prosthetic I‚Äôd worked on for countless hours boxed up in a guitar case I had lying around.

The second best part of conferences was everything else. Food, drinks, and in general fucking around while I wasn‚Äôt blabbing on about synthetic muscle polymers. It was pretty great, reminded me of being on tour. I‚Äôd probably hit up a bar and then head back home, and then it'd be my turn to ask questions tomorrow.

I was nearly done packing when a voice said from behind me, ‚ÄúUh, hey there.‚Äù

I stuffed my laptop into my bag and zipped it before turning to address the stranger. I was surprised when I had to look up at him. He was taller than me by at least a head, wearing a Hawaiian button-up tucked messily into cream-colored slacks. He also had the notable quality of appearing completely lost.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù I answered.

‚ÄúWhoa, cool arms,‚Äù the man casually said, apparently just noticing them. ‚ÄúCould you help me out for a sec?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe, depends.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this Center 2E? I‚Äôm supposed to be at a presentation in‚Ä¶‚Äù he checked his smartwatch. ‚ÄúTwelve minutes ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is 6B.‚Äù

‚ÄúWelp.‚Äù He pursed his lips. ‚ÄúIt seems I‚Äôve got a lot of free time now.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúWhat are you missing?‚Äù

He waved a dismissive hand. ‚ÄúSome engineered protein thing. They‚Äôre making all sorts of combined transcription-translation proteins, and I thought it‚Äôd be cool to see some of that more in-depth.‚Äù

I snapped my guitar-made-arm-case shut. ‚ÄúDefinitely not in the right place. This is the NASCEC conference. Well, the end of its second day, anyways.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòNassec‚Äô? I feel like I‚Äôve heard of that before.‚Äù He glanced at the guitar case. ‚ÄúSome kind of music thing, right?‚Äù

*This guy really is lost.* I unsnapped the case and turned it around for him to see. ‚ÄúDecent guess, but no.‚Äù

His eyes widened. ‚ÄúWhoa. So I wandered into some kind of cybernetics conference? Definitely not the worst thing to wander into. D‚Äôya think I could catch part of it tomorrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you technically have to pay admission, but nobody‚Äôs gonna check. Assuming you sneak in through whatever way led you here.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy kinda guy.‚Äù He bobbed his head, smiling. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôve got an arm in a guitar case. How did that happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt bother to find a dedicated case in time.‚Äù I snapped it back shut and shouldered my laptop bag. ‚ÄúHow does someone end up on the opposite side of a convention center from where they‚Äôre supposed to be?‚Äù

‚ÄúI, uh, tried to follow the arrows. Also, this mobile app for my conference is really poorly designed. Also, you only answered half my question.‚Äù

I chuckled. ‚ÄúWhat, never seen a guy with a cybernetic arm or three before?‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw several with just one outside earlier which I‚Äôm no longer questioning the unusual frequency of, but three is the most. Maybe I *should* come back here tomorrow. I have so many questions.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot uncommon,‚Äù I said, making to leave. I only half-considered my next words. He seemed easy-going enough. ‚ÄúI was gonna swing by the bar about now. Wanna come?‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst round‚Äôs on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm. I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre not going to a coffee shop this late.‚Äù He glanced backwards, then checked his phone. ‚ÄúI was gonna attend this new attendee reception networking thing, but‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs never going to top getting tipsy and talking about cybernetic arms.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù I said, beginning to walk. ‚ÄúSo who do I have the pleasure of buying a drink for?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! Uh,‚Äù he stuttered, falling in step beside me. ‚ÄúName‚Äôs Andrew. And you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúAndre. Current PhD student and aspiring prosthetic engineer,‚Äù I replied. It was almost refreshing in a strange sort of way to talk to someone who didn‚Äôt know me from screaming into a microphone or a dramatized feature-length film.

‚ÄúGreat to meet ya. So‚Ä¶ *aspiring?‚Äù*

‚Äì

I took us to one of the city‚Äôs many hidden gem bars. Synth jazz played overhead, and the place was busy enough to have a good atmosphere without being obnoxiously loud.

My new acquaintance was apparently not used to sudden excursions, especially with a ‚Äúcool cyborg guy‚Äù, as he put it. I rolled my eyes at that, but supposed it was better than being called the Terminator. I bought us a few drinks.

Andrew was fun to talk to, especially after a jello shot or two. It turns out he was also a PhD student, focusing on molecular genetics, which explained the protein presentation he‚Äôd missed. He was here for an entirely different conference, and had flown out from the United States.

‚ÄúAh, so you‚Äôre a Yank!‚Äù I exclaimed. ‚ÄúThat explains a lot!‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, whatever,‚Äù Andrew waved a hand. ‚ÄúI could drive for an hour and be back in Freedom Land. From what I‚Äôve seen in my whole nine hours of being here, Montreal is just a US city but more French.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpoken like a true Yank. I know for a fact you can‚Äôt find *these* in the US.‚Äù

‚ÄúBacon cheese fries?‚Äù He scoffed, putting one into his mouth. ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôre just *yanking* my chain‚Ä¶ sorry. But I‚Äôll admit they do taste pretty damn good.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey taste that good ‚Äòcause they were made in Canada.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes and took a drink. ‚ÄúHow do you even‚Ä¶ *eat* them?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike this.‚Äù I shoved a handful in my mouth.

He blinked. ‚ÄúThanks. I guess the better question is how do you *metabolize* them? You told me you‚Äôve got artificial organs along with all your limbs, but‚Ä¶ which ones?‚Äù

‚ÄúBasically everything from here down,‚Äù I said, chewing, gesturing to a point roughly above my beltline. ‚ÄúKinda, anyways. If you‚Äôre wondering how I metabolize food, I‚Äôve got some weird electrochemistry stuff going on. Synthetic membranes, some‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMembranes?‚Äù Andrew interrupted, leaning forward. ‚ÄúDoes it use a passive gradient? Or are there pumps that help push nutrients? Wait, no no, what‚Äôs your gut microbiome look like? How did that fare?‚Äù

He asked questions so quickly, it was like he was trying to decide which one was best to ask but his mouth wasn‚Äôt even considering that as an option. I enjoyed it. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a small amount of recirculation that happens since half my intestines got melted. As for my microbiome, I actually had to get a transplant done. Doctors pumped me *full* of antibiotics after the accident, which was real nice of them, but had the side effect of completely fucking obliterating everything living inside me.‚Äù

He rubbed his chin. ‚ÄúThey tend to do that. Wait, so, how seamless is the connection between your prosthetics and your actual body? Also, what‚Äôs your daily calorie intake? Since‚Ä¶ y‚Äôknow.‚Äù

I took a swig of my beverage. ‚ÄúLess than you for sure, with your unusual lankiness. And it is *not* seamless. It‚Äôs actually pretty fucking awful somedays.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù He frowned, tapping his empty glass. ‚ÄúThat sucks. Is it with the nervlinks, or‚Ä¶ Sorry, I don‚Äôt know enough to complain with you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîit‚Äôs pretty great. I get to walk around and scream my throat out just like I normally would. But phantom limb sensations suck ass. They aren‚Äôt as bad since I got these new ones a while ago, but still. That plus a bunch of other things that compound on each other, I won‚Äôt bore you with the details.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn. I can‚Äôt relate, but I‚Äôm sorry about that.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill got a good head on me, though. Speaking of, ready for another round?‚Äù

He glanced at his empty glass. ‚ÄúEhh‚Ä¶ I probably shouldn‚Äôt. The last thing I need for tomorrow is a terrible hangover.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, I know what you need.‚Äù I smirked, and called a waiter over. ‚ÄúTwo *Triple Threats* on tap, please.‚Äù

‚ÄúTriple Threat?‚Äù Andrew asked once the waiter was gone.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs *Doctor Sam‚Äôs* Triple Threat to you.‚Äù

He snorted. ‚ÄúThat sounds like what a heavyset biker guy would name his motorcycle.‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt knock it ‚Äòtill you try it. And I would think you of all people would know what it is.‚Äù

He shrugged.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got, like, special enzymes or inhibitors or whatever that make it better. No hangover and you still feel good. *Real* good. Oh, it‚Äôs also got weed in it.‚Äù

He raised two disbelieving eyebrows. ‚ÄúYou just ordered me an edible? A drinkable? What even is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs technically a beer, I think. It uses barley, but they‚Äôve got special engineered yeast that produce the special whatevers that make it good. And then they add in whatever else.‚Äù

His eyes lit up. ‚ÄúOh! *That!* I do know what that is! Genetically engineered yeasts are so cool. That‚Äôs how they get the cannabinoids into the drink. They‚Äôve designed a whole pathway of enzymes to get the yeast to turn sugars into them, along with your usual alcohol. But the filtration process filters out a lot of the larger proteins, so they add in the enzymes that bind acetaldehyde later in the process.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Chemistry ‚Äòn shit. Tastes good, too.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the coolest part is that they used the pathways that *already existed* in cannabis plants and simply optimized them for the conditions they use in the brewing process, like‚Ä¶‚Äù he paused, thinking through the alcohol fog, ‚Äú‚Ä¶temperature or whatever. All that and they still can‚Äôt make a better rubisco.‚Äù

I grinned. ‚ÄúYou talk a lot about science crap. I like it.‚Äù

He paused at that. ‚ÄúMaybe I don‚Äôt need another drink.‚Äù

‚ÄúMayyybe you do. I wanna hear what you‚Äôll go on about with even less inhibitions.‚Äù

The waiter came back around with two beautifully red effervescent drinks. I thanked them and raised Andrew a glass.

He shrugged and lifted his own. ‚ÄúSure. But you gotta tell me in detail how those things link to your brain, because I‚Äôve been thinking about it ever since you brought up phantom limb sensations. Or, no, tell me the real reason you have a prosthetic in a guitar case, and why you‚Äôre fine with bringing it to a bar.‚Äù

I nodded and clinked his glass. While I took a big gulp, Andrew took a sip.

‚ÄúGood, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Kinda‚Ä¶ banana-y? Maybe some citrus in there too? Very tropical.‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno what the hell‚Äôs in it. Anyways, guitar case! It‚Äôs my dissertation work. And if it gets stolen, whatever. It‚Äôs a prototype and I‚Äôm already planning to use my university‚Äôs assemblers to make another.‚Äù

He nodded, taking a drink. ‚ÄúA whole dissertation. Is it a stupid question to ask why you‚Äôre going for a doctorate?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah probably. I mean, look at me. I‚Äôve been in the market for some *actual good* cybernetics for a while, and decided I was the best person to do that. So here I am. Procrastinating on writing my dissertation and having a good time doing it.‚Äù

He laughed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in that same boat soon, I bet. So you get your doctorate, what then? What‚Äôs your end goal, I guess?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe end goal? Getting some non-shit limbs on myself. Not just non-shit, but I want some *seriously good* stuff attached to my poor stumps. I‚Äôve also been playing with the idea of making my own power armor.‚Äù

‚ÄúPower armor!‚Äù he exclaimed. ‚ÄúCool! Using that myolin stuff?‚Äù

‚ÄúA hell of a lot more than what‚Äôs in these,‚Äù I said, tapping my arm. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs *very* cool. Fall-from-a-skyscraper-without-a-scratch cool.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow far could you jump in one?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, thirty meters, easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many football fields is that?‚Äù he asked, before giggling to himself and taking another sip. ‚ÄúOh man, my head‚Äôs warm.‚Äù

Despite the awful joke he so obviously set me up for, I laughed. ‚ÄúLightweight. But yeah, I‚Äôve got a few ideas. Make my own workshop and do cool shit every day. That answer your question, Wander Stilts?‚Äù

‚ÄúWander‚Ä¶?‚Äù He wrinkled his nose. ‚ÄúOh, whatever. That was my first time getting lost in a while. Plus I‚Äôve never been here. Also, that‚Äôs body-shaming.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can body shame me, if it makes you feel better,‚Äù I teased.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôll pass.‚Äù He took a sip. After another moment, he unsurprisingly asked another question. ‚ÄúSo what design are you gonna go for?‚Äù Andrew asked. ‚ÄúLike, cosmetics. On your limbs and armor I mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ good question. I have a few in mind, but that‚Äôs not one of my priorities at the moment.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should think about hexagons. Or maybe a bunch of double helices like DNA. That‚Äôd look awesome. Oh, and do gold-on-black.‚Äù

I snorted. ‚ÄúGolden hexagons. So you want me to look like a beehive.‚Äù

He put his hands up in surrender. ‚ÄúOr hot pink helices. I don‚Äôt judge.‚Äù

I shook my head, smiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it. So what about you? What‚Äôs your end goal after you become ‚ÄòDoctor Steel‚Äô?‚Äù

‚ÄúScheele,‚Äù he corrected amusedly. ‚ÄúAlthough that‚Äôd be a pretty metal name‚Ä¶ Sorry again. But my end goal is to figure out what my end goal is. I dunno. Go join a lab researching some origin of life stuff. Or maybe something working with plants, or protein design. Or maybe I could shift focus and work on artificial organs. We‚Äôd make a good duo.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want to get a second degree, sure. Those synthetic organs are no joke. *So* much chemistry.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah. I wonder what it's like to grow-slash-fabricate an organ for someone and then just‚Ä¶ give it to them? How would that feel? Giving someone a thing that‚Äôs literally *them*, but not, and also kinda yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúDunno,‚Äù I said, finishing the last of my drink. Andrew was a third through his own. ‚ÄúBut I know how it feels to be on the other end. It‚Äôs good.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, crap,‚Äù he mumbled, frowning. ‚ÄúSorry, I haven‚Äôt got enough things to stop words from coming out at the moment, which isn‚Äôt an excuse, but I just‚Äî‚Äù

I waved a silencing hand. ‚ÄúHeh, shit. Even if that was offensive, I‚Äôm far past caring about how people see me. I mean, it was definitely rough at times. Hell, I was put back together not twenty kilometers from here. You lose all your limbs and it‚Äôs so‚Ä¶ *intensely personal*. Then they slap some new ones on you, say ‚Äògood as new!‚Äô and you just can‚Äôt help but wonder if they‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù

The student across from me fell silent.

‚ÄúI mean, you know. I‚Äôm pretty much over it by now,‚Äù I added.

He nodded slowly, turning his glass around with two fingers. ‚ÄúYou know‚Ä¶ biology is really something else. People only three hundred years ago were so perplexed by living processes that they thought we ran on a completely different operating system than the rest of the universe. How wild is that?‚Äù

I snorted. ‚ÄúYeah, I can imagine how they‚Äôd react to metal limbs.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù he scolded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre *alive*, and that‚Äôs probably the craziest thing in the world.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I get it. It‚Äôs a fuckin‚Äô miracle I‚Äôm alive. Seriously.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all alive. A few prosthetics doesn‚Äôt‚Äî I‚Äôm, uh, I mean to say that the fact that something *can* live is so incredibly‚Ä¶ incredible. We each have a few dozen trillion cells, each of them doing a trillion different things. But a single cell doesn‚Äôt think, and neither does a synthetic muscle fiber.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶That‚Äôs also part of it. I‚Ä¶ I want them to be *me*. Like, I own these, I can make ‚Äòem look however the fuck I want them to, but they‚Äôre not *mine*. My cells are doing all this crazy shit, but that‚Äôs my DNA. No one else has it. These arms and legs? To an extent, yes, but‚Ä¶‚Äù I shook my head.

‚ÄúPeople get organ replacements all the time, grown from their own cells. They didn‚Äôt *make* it per se, but their body accepts it and the organ accepts the body. I don‚Äôt think it should matter where that person‚Äôs body ends and ‚Äòartificialness‚Äô begins. It all works together to make that person be a person. I‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt mean to compare lab-grown organs to other things, but it‚Äôs kind of special. Beautiful, if you‚Äôre feeling really poetic.

‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm not feeling very poetic?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúYou just call the body a machine and move on, maybe. It‚Äôs pretty lame and undercuts basically *everything* cool your body does, but‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not super far from the truth. We‚Äôre all just bags of chemical reactions.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd as an added bonus, we‚Äôre aware of that fact.‚Äù

He leaned back in his seat and stared up at the ceiling. His cheeks were flushed red and his eyes had a drunken glaze, giving a faraway look to them. I followed his gaze. He was probably looking far past the ceiling, at that moment.

‚ÄúWe are made of star stuff,‚Äù I mumbled.

‚ÄúA way for the universe to know itself,‚Äù Andrew finished.

I pursed my lips and thought for a moment. ‚ÄúYou know, my voice isn‚Äôt even my ‚Äònormal‚Äô voice. You can hear this‚Ä¶ twang to it. Haven‚Äôt spoken an organic, home-grown word for over a decade.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhoa. Never would‚Äôve guessed.‚Äù He took a final swig, emptying his glass. ‚ÄúDo you like it?‚Äù

I lightly chuckled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost track of the number of times I‚Äôve been grateful for it.‚Äù

‚Äî

Hey! So this was really fun to write. I had no idea what to do with it for a while and was *very* close to writing a double-hazard Hazardous Recovery x Occupation Hazard ficnap, involving one particular angry Yotul (I mean come on, it's basically begging to be written!). But then I wrote a small bit of dialogue between these two grad students, and it exploded into something way bigger than I thought it could've. So this is the result! I hope 3000 words of two dudes talking was enjoyable.

‚ÄúYou should be standing at the altar right now, not here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah! That‚Äôs it!‚Äù My sister Megan's breath hitched between kisses, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness, ‚ÄúYou're going to be late.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. She can wait,‚Äù came the familiar voice of my mate, just before their words were drowned by the sound of more kisses.

‚ÄúRight now, you're the only thing that matters.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot too deep‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to get pregnant.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not your call.‚Äù

The next second, the unmistakable sound of fabric tearing‚Äî

While I remained standing at the altar, looking straight ahead.

It was the night of our Mating Ceremony.

I stood before the altar adorned with silverleaf flowers, clutching our engraved vow rings. My heart thudded in my chest, heavy with nerves but full of hope.

I believed that once my mate held my hand, our destinies would forever intertwine under the Moon Goddess‚Äôs witness.

But the next moment, a Beta rushed over, his expression grim as he whispered something to the pack elder.

A hush swept over the crowd. Uneasy murmurs followed.

I turned toward the resting chambers, a knot of dread tightening in my chest‚Äî

Until a warrior opened the door leading there. And in that moment, my entire world shattered.

There stood my mate, bare-chested, and in his arms‚Äî

Was my sister, Megan, the one I had nurtured, protected, and trusted with everything.

She looked straight at me, her lips curled into a triumphant smirk.

The crowd erupted‚Äînot in cheers, but in cruel laughter.

Blessings turned into whispers. Whispers into sneers. Sneers into open mockery.

I stood frozen, and the ring slipped from my fingers, hitting the ground with a crisp clink‚Äîlike the sharp echo of a heart breaking.

‚ÄúLauren, what‚Äôs done is done. Just let him go‚Äîto your sister,‚Äù my mother urged softly at my side.

My mind went blank.

Tears streamed down, but I couldn‚Äôt even feel them.

My parents murmured gently, trying to soothe me, as if that would ease the betrayal.

‚ÄúI now declare that the bride tonight... is Megan, not Lauren.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù

A low voice cut through the chaos.

The crowd fell silent and parted instinctively.

Landon, Alpha of the neighboring Seafall Pack, stepped forward in a sleek black suit. His face was cold as stone, but his eyes burned with fury.

He was mysterious, rarely seen in public.

He stopped in front of me, dropped to one knee without hesitation, and reached out a hand:

‚ÄúBe my Luna. I‚Äôll show everyone that you are the only one worthy of honor.‚Äù

I glared at my mate and my sister, then turned to Landon‚Äîand placed my hand in his without a second thought.

What should have been a mating ceremony with my fated mate, became the moment I was claimed by a different Alpha.

After we sealed the mate bond, he treated me with the utmost tenderness.

But despite our efforts, we were never able to have a pup of our own.

One day, in the gentlest voice, he said... maybe I was the reason we couldn't have a child.

Desperate, we sought the help of a witch.

Her potion worked‚Äîand for the first time, I was expecting a child.

From then on, Landon treated me with even greater care and devotion.

I believed‚Äîtruly‚Äîthat he was my home. My fate.

Until the day I overheard his conversation with a friend.

‚ÄúLandon, that was cruel. Luna Lauren‚Äôs been nothing but good to you‚Äî

How could you have the witch transfer Megan‚Äôs child into Lauren‚Äôs womb just because Megan didn‚Äôt want to go through labor? You turned her into a breeder.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the child's due in two months. What then?‚Äù

He was silent for a moment. Then sighed.

‚ÄúOnce the child is born, I‚Äôll give it to Megan. It‚Äôs what she‚Äôs always wanted.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Lauren?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs for Lauren, I‚Äôll tell her the child didn‚Äôt make it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôll stay by her side for the rest of her life.‚Äù

So that was it.

His gentleness, his care‚Äî

All for her.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you afraid Lauren will find out?‚Äù

After a pause, Landon replied,

‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really believe that?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe trusts me,‚Äù he said, voice steady.

‚ÄúIf I say it‚Äôs true, she won‚Äôt doubt me. She never does.‚Äù

There was a silence. Then his friend lowered his voice:

‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt regret it.‚Äù

Landon gave a faint laugh. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù

I stood outside the door, my fingers digging into my palms. There was no pain. I‚Äôd gone numb.

I had only come to bring him afternoon tea.

Now, all I felt was a gaping hole in my chest, as if something had been viciously torn away.

The cold wind pierced through me.

I stumbled back to the pack house and didn‚Äôt even bother turning on the lights.

Collapsed onto the sofa, I shivered uncontrollably.

Tears slipped silently down my cheeks‚Äîtoo drained to even wipe them.

Then I heard the door click open.

He was home.

**Chapter 2**

The sound of shoes on the floor grew closer.

He walked up to the couch and bent down slightly, his voice gentle and tinged with concern.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you turn on the lights? The maid said you didn‚Äôt eat... Is your stomach bothering you again?‚Äù

He reached out, gently brushing aside the hair on my forehead. His brows furrowed in genuine concern.

‚ÄúLauren, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

He knelt down, his palm covering the back of my hand as he spoke softly,

‚ÄúYou have to eat‚Äîit's not good for the child.‚Äù

I stared at him. At his tender, considerate expression.

So... love could be acted out after all.

Four years ago, at my Mating Ceremony, it was Landon who stepped forward and made me his Luna.

Back then, I thought he was the one who had pulled me out of my nightmare.

After becoming his Luna, I supported him, helped him strengthen his pack, year after year.

This year, with the help of a witch, we finally conceived a child.

Everything was perfect.

He held me in his arms, saying this child was the gift he had longed for. His smile was gentle, and his eyes so warm they almost melted me.

But it turns out... it was all just another carefully crafted lie.

If he could act‚Äî

Why couldn‚Äôt I?

I blinked slowly and curved my lips into a faint smile.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Just a little tired.‚Äù

My voice was soft, tinged with fatigue‚Äînothing unusual.

He sighed in relief, coaxing gently,

‚ÄúAlright. Get some rest early.‚Äù

Fine.

Then let‚Äôs keep acting for another three days.

In three days, this performance will end.

The next morning, Landon accompanied me to a prenatal checkup.

He was attentive the whole time, asking the doctor countless questions.

The pack doctor chuckled, ‚ÄúAlpha really dotes on Luna.‚Äù

He held my hand, his gaze gentle.

‚ÄúThis is a child we‚Äôve waited so long for. Of course I‚Äôm going to take good care of both of you.‚Äù

As we stepped out of the exam room, we bumped into Megan.

She wore a loose dress. The moment she saw us, a flash of pride flickered in her eyes.

I looked at her belly‚Äîconspicuously padded‚Äîand sneered.

No wonder she‚Äôd said it was ‚Äúsuch a coincidence‚Äù that we were expecting a child at the same time. She‚Äôd been waiting for this moment all along.

She walked over, smiling brightly.

‚ÄúLauren, when‚Äôs your due date?‚Äù

As she spoke, her hand reached toward my belly.

I gave her a cold look‚Äîand slapped her hand away.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù Megan‚Äôs expression darkened instantly, A flicker of anger flashed in her eyes.

She opened her mouth to retort‚Äîbut I lowered my head and pressed a hand to my stomach, voice weak,

‚ÄúMy stomach... it hurts a little...‚Äù

She stopped mid-sentence. That smugness on her face disappeared immediately.

Landon supported me at once, concern in his voice,

‚ÄúWas the checkup too long? Do you want to go back and rest?‚Äù

He sounded so worried, but I saw it clearly‚Äî

His gaze was on Megan the whole time, silently trying to soothe her.

I lowered my lashes and murmured,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the restroom.‚Äù

He frowned, wanting to follow.

I waved a hand. ‚ÄúNo need. Just wait for me here.‚Äù

He hesitated, then finally nodded.

‚ÄúBe careful.‚Äù

I turned into the restroom.

But the moment the door closed‚ÄîI saw him hurrying off. Just as I expected.

He‚Äôd gone to comfort Megan.

Quietly, I followed. I stood at a distance and watched him coaxing her, his voice low and soft.

Megan pouted, narrowing her eyes in suspicion.

‚ÄúDo you have feelings for her? She embarrassed me just now and you didn‚Äôt even defend me. Are you still holding on to her?‚Äù

Landon sighed helplessly.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just thinking of the child. After all, she‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt finish.

Instead, he reached into his pocket and took out a delicate jewelry box.

Opening it, he pulled out a brand-new bracelet and gently placed it on her wrist.

‚ÄúThe bracelet you wanted last time‚ÄîI got it for you.‚Äù

Megan‚Äôs mood visibly improved. She smiled coyly,

‚ÄúThe stock you recommended last time made me a ton of money. Got anything new for me?‚Äù

I stood there watching the scene, suddenly finding it all absurd.

Landon‚Äîusing everything that once belonged to me to please her.

I turned and walked away.

Pulled out my phone. Dialed a number.

‚ÄúHello. Just confirming the time of the procedure.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, everything will be ready tomorrow.‚Äù

Behind me, familiar footsteps suddenly stopped.

‚ÄúTomorrow?‚Äù Landon‚Äôs voice held a trace of confusion.

‚ÄúWhere are you going?‚Äù

I turned around, meeting his gaze with a faint smile.

‚ÄúI booked a maternity photo shoot. I want to take a family portrait... something to remember this by.‚Äù

**Chapter 3**

His expression shifted slightly, a flicker of hesitation passing through his eyes.

I arched my brows deliberately, my tone light and casual.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong? Don‚Äôt you want to come with me?‚Äù

He opened his mouth but avoided my gaze.

‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs not that... I just worry it‚Äôll tire you out. And I‚Äôve got a pack meeting tomorrow‚Äîhow about another day?‚Äù

I looked at him and let out a soft laugh, my voice warm and considerate.

‚ÄúOf course. Pack business comes first. I‚Äôll go on my own.‚Äù

He seemed relieved, smiling as he reached out to lightly ruffle my hair with practiced affection.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always so thoughtful. What would I do without you?‚Äù

The morning of the procedure, just before leaving the house, Landon suddenly took out a small bracelet and gently put it on my wrist.

‚ÄúThis is for you,‚Äù he said with his usual gentle tone and soft gaze.

I looked down‚Äîit was the matching bracelet to the one he gave Megan. A freebie.

My fingers clenched slightly. I looked up at him and smiled softly.

‚ÄúThank you. It‚Äôs lovely.‚Äù

He smiled too, ruffling my hair again as he murmured,

‚ÄúLauren, you‚Äôre always so good to me.‚Äù

Before heading to the hospital for the procedure, I decided to stop by my parents‚Äô house.

But before I even reached the door, I heard voices drifting out clearly.

Megan‚Äôs spoiled, complaining tone:

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so special about Lauren? She hit me yesterday!‚Äù

My mother‚Äôs gentle voice trying to soothe her:

‚ÄúJust be patient a little longer. Didn‚Äôt we already help you take her fianc√©? This time will work too. Don‚Äôt rush.‚Äù

My father sighed heavily.

‚ÄúEnough. You‚Äôve already become the Luna of Lauren‚Äôs first mate. If your mate‚Äôs Alpha parents ever find out how this child really came to be, there‚Äôll be a lot to pay‚Äîfor all of us.‚Äù

Landon‚Äôs voice chimed in, soft but steady:

‚ÄúMegan, don‚Äôt worry. I brought the prenatal report from yesterday‚Äîit‚Äôs all good. We just need to wait now.‚Äù

He paused, then added,

‚ÄúRyan, Amanda, please don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôve got this. For Megan, I‚Äôll do anything.‚Äù

My fingertips went ice-cold.

It felt like all the blood in my body had stopped flowing.

So... they all knew.

All this time... they‚Äôd been in it together. I was nothing more than a pawn.

A maid knocked to deliver coffee.

Landon opened the door casually‚Äîthen froze.

Lying quietly at the threshold was the broken bracelet he had just given me that morning.

His expression changed instantly.

He gasped, eyes darting in panic as he bolted to the door and looked around frantically.

Then came the calls. Over and over.

When I finally picked up, his voice was trembling with anxiety.

‚ÄúLauren, where are you? I can explain‚Äîjust listen, okay?‚Äù

I kept silence.

His voice grew increasingly frantic.

‚ÄúLauren! Please‚Äî Where are you?!‚Äù

Then, over the phone, a nurse‚Äôs voice came through clearly in the background:

‚ÄúLauren Whitman? Please sign here before the procedure.‚Äù

On the other end, Landon sounded like he had been punched in the gut.

He choked, then exploded into hysteria.

‚ÄúProcedure? Where are you?! What are you talking about?!‚Äù

He was screaming now, voice completely unraveling.

I stared at the screen for a moment, then gently swiped my finger.

Call ended.

But some days, I still miss him. And I hate that I do.

I miss the version of him who used to hold my hand when I was anxious. The version who would send long messages just to make me smile. The one who knew how I liked my coffee and always made sure I got home safe.

I keep replaying those parts of him like a highlight reel, even though I know how things ended. I know how badly it hurt when he made me feel like a stranger. I know how empty I felt sitting next to him while he gave all his emotions to someone else.

Why does the heart hold on to the soft parts and ignore the ones that broke us?

I am not trying to get back with him. I do not even want to speak to him again. But I am tired of missing someone who made me feel so alone in the end.

Archivist: Statement of Narciss Vermillion regarding... his own perfection. Statement taken directly from subject, 12th March 2017. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.
Statement begins.

[A needle scratches across a wax cylinder before the voice begins - honey-smooth yet mechanized, like a phonograph pretending to breathe]

Narciss: Tell me, Archivist‚Äîwhen you hear your own voice on those tapes, does it¬†ache,¬†knowing how rough and unrefined it sounds? Your pores alone are a tragedy. That jawline? A crime against geometry. Those eye bags. Do you store your last remaining sanity in them? How anyone could come to love such an imperfect face is something I cannot fathom. And yet here you sit, judging horrors far beyond your uneven little comprehension. But not to worry. We'll work on you later.

Archivist: Please start your statement. I want to know how you became.. 

Narciss: You mistake me for something that¬†became.¬†How quaint. You know, your little patron played a huge role in who I am. Who I always was.
I‚Äôve always known people were watching me.
Not in the paranoid way‚Äîat least, not at first. It was just the way the world worked. Eyes followed you. Voices murmured. Every laugh, every stumble, every misplaced word was noted, filed away, judged. I learned early that to be seen was to be¬†measured. The degree of the scrutiny only intensified when I finished university and got a job as a plastic surgeon. Because the people around me were trained to notice imperfections.
And I was always found to be... lacking. 
It started with small things. My nose was too wide. My lips too thin. My laugh too loud, my voice too quiet, my posture too stiff, my walk too loose. I tried to fix them. First with makeup, then with exercises, then with little rituals I read about or heard women gossiping about‚Äîhold your tongue just so, tilt your chin just right, smile without showing teeth, but not too tight. It did fix some things, but it wasn't enough.

And then I found the mirror. Or rather, the mirror found me. I don't know where it came from, but one evening i found it laying on the surgical table. It showed me the truth of who I really was. The truth of just how many things needed to be fixed.
The first time I looked into the mirror, it showed the state of my pores. They weren't just visible. They were gaping.¬†Craters in my skin, oozing thick sebum. Strangely, I'd never noticed just how much they stood out... that's when i decided to fix things. I gagged, but my hands were already moving, digging into my cheeks with nails that weren‚Äôt mine. The pain was distant, muffled, like I was watching someone else peel back their own face. 
But when I looked up, my skin was as smooth as a doll's. The next day the only things I heard from others were praises and compliments. Oh, how smooth my skin had looked! What products have I been using? How did they not notice it before?
The next evening the mirror showed me my horrible posture. So I tore out my ribs. They didn't want to go, adamant on keeping my body so very deformed. But I was stronger. 
Snip. Twist. Tear.
I ran my fingers along my new spine‚Äîa slender rod of polished acrylic.
Better.
Oh, how well did I carry myself! Did I do any exercises? Was I willing to share?
I fixed my body first. My new cheekbones gleamed like polished ivory. My lips stung with injected¬†nectar ¬†that made them glisten. All the tense muscles, the imperfect bones, I had refined them all.
I was a piece of art.
 And people began to notice fast. I quickly became known in the quickly developing world of plastic surgery. Celebrities began flooding in, begging to be operated on by me. And I helped them.
But then came the eyes. I saw them in the mirror that night. That was the first time fully understood how disgusting human eyes are.¬†The way they wobble in their sockets. The red veins that riddle them are like cracks in cheap porcelain. And their color! The disgusting brown that had always reminded me of mud. When I pried them out with a speculum, I heard them¬†pop¬†like overripe grapes. The new ones were smooth glass orbs, the irises painted in perfect swirls of aquamarine. They didn't dry out. They didn't cry. And I was content. But they bothered my clients so very much. And for the first time in a while, the whispers of contempt returned.
I had wondered what imperfections they were noticing in my form for a while. I begged the mirror to guide me, to show me what more needed fixing. But my reflection was perfect. And then I realised that humans have more than one sense. I had no flaw that could be seen, my skin was perfect to the touch. But true refinement touches every sense.  Perhaps the sound that my organs made was too much for them to handle?
That night, a considerable amount of silicone dissapeared from the neighbouring clinic. 
I poured it into me through my tear ducts‚Äîa warm, syrupy polymer that coated my insides. I felt it slither down my throat, filling my lungs, my stomach, my veins. When it hardened, my organs didn't squelch anymore. No more wet, animal noises when I moved. 
I worked on my scent next. Now it was not the crude musk of sweat and oil, but the eloquent notes of jasmine and chilled mercury from a perfume bottle that I stored right in my stomach.
The last thing I took from myself was my voice. I had hated the grating stumble of human speech that sounded too coarse coming out from my cherry-red lips. 
My vocal chords snapped when I tore them out with pliers. I did not have the patience to remove them in a more careful way. After all, they were the last thing stopping me from reaching perfection. I replaced them with the most intricate piece of machinery. Now what your ears pick up is a sonnet of perfectly curated notes.
[A pause. Then clicking noises, accompanied by a shallow screeching sound]
I know that you may be thinking that I'd forgotten about the last sense. And indeed. What about my taste? Oh, Archivist... you would¬†weep¬†to know how I‚Äôve perfected it. My tongue is lacquered in liquid silver. No bitter edges, no clumsy textures. Even the words I speak leave behind the aftertaste of¬†something¬†better than human.
[A sigh, like a violin string snapping]
But you? You¬†reek¬†of coffee and desperation. I can¬†hear¬†the dryness in your throat when you speak. And that¬†taste¬†of fear on your lips? Unrefined. Unfiltered.¬†
[Deliberate wet clicking noises]
When was the last time you¬†truly¬†looked in a mirror? I reckon its been a long time. We really must do something about that.
[The recording warps violently]
[Click]
.....
[Click]
Statement ends.

Archivist: What an unpleasant man.... thing. He certainly gives himself too much credit. While sitting next to him the only scent I've picked up was that of decay and cheap plastic. And that God awful sound of rubber...  I think I'm going to remember it for a while.
[Faint rustling of pages]
Narciss Vermillion indeed was a renowed surgeon. Once, at the very least. There is a clinic called ""Refinements"" still run under his name, but it was established as far back as 1939. I sent Sasha to investigate the address, but all she came across was an empty decimated building full of mirrors. She said the glass felt too warm to the touch. However, she did manage to find a photograph of a rather.. weird nature. I have attached it to the original notes about this avatar.
From what I can assume, he is the work of either the Flesh or the Stranger. What unsettles me most, though, is his self-awareness. Or rather, the lack of it. Most avatars don't reflect on their nature, they simply are. Narciss, however, is fully aware of what he himself has done to his own body, but is either extremely delusional, or believes in his own flawlesness to the degree that he chooses to avoid understanding how he truly looks. Sasha mentioned that seeing him on the way out, she said she got the ""Uncanny Valley"" feelings from him... I had to look that up. He also kept persuading her to get her neck removed.

I have everything, I still do things, I have a loving partner and a few close friends. I just feel as if there's no true satisfaction from anything. 

I still have my wants and desires, but I feel so disconnected from them. as if my soul isn't there and my brain is just running on muscle memory. I want to move in with my partner in the future, I still spend money on things I like, I still do things, download games to play, but I just feel like something in my body is missing. something that would have let me truly feel.

I still feel. I still cry a lot, I still act excited. but I don't truly feel connected to anything. my body lives, but the person who was there is long gone. it's nearing a year now since I started feeling like this. I'm only 18, it will be 1/19th of my life spent empty.

my partner loves me, I love my partner. I enjoy impulse spending. I drink coffee sometimes in the morning. I go out occasionally. I hang out with my friends. but I feel like it's all just muscle memory. like, what would the person that's missing right now do?

I'm tired of this. I wanted to live, I wanted a future, but now I don't really want anything much at all.

1ljzfqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ljzfqi/aio_for_calling_my_boyfriend_a_loser/,AIO for calling my boyfriend a loser?,"‚Ä¶I know you should never call people nasty words. But I think he is. In this post I want to be completely honest and I need your honest opinion.

I (31F) have been with my boyfriend (33M) for 10 years. These 10 years have been very turbulent in terms of disagreements. My problems have always been that I am very sensitive and I get upset quickly. My love language is that I want it like in the movies and I know it‚Äôs unrealistic, but it would be a dream scenario. His problems are that he shuts down in conversations and in everyday life he rarely shows the love that I wish for. In our country it is normal to call your partner ""honey"" (translated differently in my language). He has never called me that or anything sweet. He thinks it's cringe. He is bad at giving flowers, buy small gifts - just what I would call general love.

The beginning of our 20s was the worst. We were really bad at communicating and almost overnight in my mid-20s, I woke up and told myself that I was showing the worst version of myself, because I knew I had a lot of love to offer. I started seeing a psychologist, read a lot about communication, gave him space during arguments and tried to be the best I could. It took years and I'm still not there, but I'm trying.

My boyfriend, on the other hand, hasn‚Äôt changed as much as I would like - and as he has promised over the years. He promises in every conversation that he'll try, I just never really get to see it. He sets the agenda for when it's important to talk about different things. If he doesn't want to, well then he doesn't want to and shuts down. He looks into his computer screen when I'm sitting next to him and trying to have a discussion. According to him, I suffer from a 'victim mentality', which has resulted in me talking about my own mistakes in every discussion when I mention his because I'm afraid of appearing like that. His love language is also still the same (i.e.... de nada).

You probably think we should just break up, right? I know, but it's hard when you love someone. He‚Äôs my best friend.

A few weeks ago we had a long and good talk about our relationship. I said that I was at the end of my rope now and that this was now or never - I'm too old for this and I want to start a family on a good foundation. I said what things I wanted him to work on and he said some things he wish I work on. I also told him that I wished he showed more respect and love. I said that I missed him sometimes and wished he would join me on small errands because I miss his company and feel like we only have actual dates. Yes yes he would definitely do that. I even suggested couples therapy and I‚Äôm willing to work extra so it doesn‚Äôt effect our budget, but no no no he was really insisting that we work on this together.

The other day I asked if he wanted to go for a ride because I needed some air. No, he was tired. I drove myself and left it at that, but I noticed that once again I got a no. I haven't seen the shadow of a flower and I know he's been to several places where they can be bought. I even said that he could pluck some of the flowers from our garden as a nice surprise because some of them would wither within a few days - not a flower in sight and they‚Äôre dead. I haven't heard a loving word. I've tried giving him breadcrumbs and saying something cute here and there and when I asked the other day if I was pretty enough because we were going out, that was the only time during these weeks I was told that I was beautiful.

Which brings us to yesterday. I was going out to buy coffee half an hour away (I'm the only one who drinks it) and I asked if he wanted to come along. Nope, he didn't want to. I then politely said that this is the reason I'm not asking anymore. He looks at his computer screen and says that he doesn't want to discuss this and I can't stand a no. When I continue, he says ""I'm not answering you on this anymore because you‚Äôre going in circles"". Again, it's a case closed. That results in me calling him a loser‚Ä¶ Saying that he‚Äôs a loser who makes promises all the time and makes me feel like nothing. Shame on me. He right away called me a b and something else nasty in our language. Said that I was a drama b who couldn‚Äôt take a no for an answer. Then I left.

When I came home I completely broke down in front of him. Told him that I was tired of this and that he couldn‚Äôt even look at me when I was talking to him and shutting me down everytime I had something to say. He told me (while he was looking at the screen) that I am completely wrong about it. I couldn't take a no and I am making myself the victim. I am solely to blame for our discussion and it is solely my fault that I was called those things yesterday. I suffer from victim mentality and I put myself on a pedestal. I said again that I called him a loser because I mean it. A loser for never showing he loves me, promising me gold and green forests, but never keeping it. Playing male chauvinist and trying to decide when my feelings are worth listening to. This resulted in him saying that he‚Äôs tired of having such b girlfriend and then shutting down completely and stopped responding. He went to bed and got up to work thing morning without a single word.

But here we are, 10 years later in a house we recently bought because love makes one blind. I think he deserves to hear what I think of him. He's heard me say ""I really want so and so"" for years and I‚Äôve heard him say he would change.

I don‚Äôt want to keep respecting a person who doesn‚Äôt respect me. I feel he deserves to hear the truth and I don‚Äôt care if we break up over this. I‚Äôm done being forgiving over broken promises. Am I overreacting? 

TL;DR. My boyfriend keeps breaking promises and that resulted me in calling him a loser. ",2,1750836900.0,AmIOverreacting,10,0.6,False

Okay, fellow Redditors, I need to share my newfound obsession.  I work from home, and let me tell you, the background noise used to drive me absolutely bonkers.  My kids, the dog, the garbage truck that seems to roll by every hour ‚Äì it was a constant battle to stay focused on calls.  I'd constantly repeat myself, get frustrated, and honestly, sometimes I just felt like a total mess on those conference calls.  I tried several noise-canceling headphones before.  Some were okay, but none were truly amazing, and most just felt bulky and uncomfortable.

Then, I stumbled upon these AI noise reduction headphones.  Seriously, the difference is night and day.  I'm talking crystal-clear calls, even when my toddler is having a full-on meltdown in the next room (true story!). The AI is super smart. It filters out background noise beautifully without muffling my voice or the other person's. I don't know how they do it, but it's magic.  I've never experienced such consistently clear and reliable audio quality.


Before these headphones, I was constantly worried about background noise messing with important calls. I'd be stressed before every meeting, wondering if I‚Äôd be clearly heard. Now? Total confidence.  I actually feel more professional and in control on calls. It's a small thing, but the peace of mind is huge.  The difference in my productivity is actually amazing. I'm spending less time repeating myself, less time apologizing for the chaos around me, and more time actually getting work done.  I swear I‚Äôve seen at least a 10-15% increase in my efficiency ‚Äì and that translates directly to less stress and more time for things I enjoy, outside of work.

Plus, they're surprisingly comfortable. I wear them for hours at a time, and they never hurt my ears or give me headaches ‚Äì even after back to back calls.  The design is really sleek and modern, too.  It‚Äôs a surprisingly important benefit.


One thing I didn't expect?  The battery life is amazing. I typically use them for 4-5 hours of calls per day, and I often make it through the whole day on a single charge.  The Bluetooth range is also really good. I can easily walk around my house without losing connection, which is perfect for those times when I need to grab something or move to a different spot for better lighting.  I've even used them while traveling, and they‚Äôve been incredibly helpful in noisy airports and coffee shops.

I did a ton of research before buying, reading reviews on tech blogs and comparison sites. I even checked out several other brands and models. What convinced me, ultimately, was reading others‚Äô personal experiences, similar to what I‚Äôm sharing now.  People kept raving about the clarity of calls, even in loud environments, which is exactly what I was looking for.  You know the feeling, right? That confidence boost when you know you're communicating effectively? I got that and so much more.


Seriously, these headphones are a game-changer (sorry, I had to use that one!). I found them on ursupermart.com, a site I've used for other tech gadgets before. If you're looking for AI noise reduction headphones, I‚Äôd highly suggest checking them out.  These have improved my workflow significantly.  The return on investment has been super quick, because it‚Äôs not just about the price; it‚Äôs about the increased productivity and the reduced stress.

In their third year of marriage, Emma's wedding certificate was accidentally ruined by spilled coffee.  
  
When she went to the county clerk's office to replace it, the clerk typed a few keystrokes and looked up with a puzzled expression. ""Ma'am, your marital status shows as single.""  
  
She froze, certain she'd misheard. ""That's impossible. My husband and I got our license right here three years ago.""  
  
The clerk checked again, her expression growing increasingly awkward. ""The system confirms you're single, but Mr. Chase is listed as married..."" She hesitated. ""His spouse is registered as another woman‚ÄîStella Reed. Do you know her?""  
  
Emma's mind exploded with white noise, her ears ringing sharply.  
  
Everyone knew Emma and Dominic Chase had grown up together. She was his first love, the one he'd protected fiercely since childhood.  
  
And Stella Reed?  
  
She was the replacement Dominic had found during the two years Emma studied abroad‚Äîsomeone to fill the void when he missed her too much.  
  
\---  
  
Emma clutched the coffee-stained fake marriage certificate as she numbly got into her car.  
  
Her phone vibrated twice, and Dominic's message appeared on the screen.  
  
\[Baby, I ditched a billion-dollar deal, bought your favorite roses and that strawberry cake you love, just so I could come home early to be with you. I miss you so much. Do you miss me?\]  
  
She stared at the message and let out a hollow laugh that quickly dissolved into tears streaming down her cheeks.  
  
For three years, he'd asked her that same question daily, expressing his supposed devotion.  
  
But all along... he'd been legally married to someone else behind her back.  
  
She remembered when they were children, how Dominic had fallen from a ten-foot tree trying to retrieve her kite, breaking his arm but still smiling as he handed her the kite, saying, ""Don't cry, Em. It doesn't hurt.""  
  
She remembered her fifteenth birthday, when he stood in the rain outside her house all night just to be the first to wish her happy birthday when she woke up.  
  
She remembered her eighteenth birthday celebration, when he rented an entire amusement park and knelt beneath exploding fireworks, saying, ""Emma, when I turn twenty-two, will you marry me?""  
  
She remembered when she left to study abroad, how he'd pressed her against the airport wall, his voice trembling: ""Two years. I'm only giving you two years, and then I'm coming to bring you back.""  
  
During those two years overseas, he video-called almost daily.  
  
Once when she was too busy with essays to answer for three days, she discovered he'd been hospitalized for alcohol poisoning.  
  
Through the screen, his bloodshot eyes pleaded: ""Baby, I can't live without you.""  
  
She always reassured him: ""I'll be home soon. Just wait a little longer.""  
  
The day she returned, she didn't tell Dominic, wanting to surprise him.  
  
Instead, when she pushed open the door to his private club room, she found him passionately kissing a girl whose profile looked strikingly similar to her own.  
  
Her bag dropped with a thud, and she fled.  
  
Dominic chased after her like a madman. When she wouldn't answer his calls, he bombarded her with messages. When she refused to see him, he stood in the rain outside her apartment, explaining over and over.  
  
""It's not what you think!""  
  
""I missed you so much these years when you wouldn't let me visit, so I found someone who reminded me of you...""  
  
""I swear, we just hugged and kissed, nothing more!""  
  
""Emma, I was wrong, but I truly love you to the point of insanity...""  
  
Finally, after he stood in the rain for three days and nights, collapsing with pneumonia and still refusing to leave the hospital, her heart softened, and she forgave him.  
  
Afterward, he treated her just as wonderfully as before.  
  
Until after they married, when she discovered his assistant had been replaced by Stella Reed. That ""replacement"" he claimed to have sent away.  
  
He explained again: ""Her parents are sick, and they struggled adjusting to the city life. She begged to come back to North Bay...""  
  
""She applied for my assistant position without my knowledge.""  
  
""She's exceptionally qualified and passed all the selection rounds. I can't just fire her without cause.""  
  
So Emma tolerated it again.  
  
Never imagining that her tolerance would turn her into the butt of a cosmic joke.  
  
As her car pulled into their gated community, Emma's tears had dried.  
  
She took a deep breath, about to push open the front door when she overheard Dominic talking with his friend in the living room:  
  
""I just came from the hospital. Stella's fine, just some minor scrapes. You should stay home with Emma, don't worry.""  
  
Dominic lounged on the sofa, his black shirt unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed. He frowned and extinguished his friend's cigarette, his voice low and cold: ""How many times have I told you not to smoke in my house? Emma hates the smell.""  
  
""Fine, fine, you obsessive husband,"" his friend teased. ""But I really don't understand‚Äîif you love Emma so much, why did you insist on marrying Stella? Honestly, is she more than just a replacement to you?""  
  
The air stilled for several seconds.  
  
Then Dominic's deep voice broke the silence:  
  
""What if she is?""  
  
""I used to think she was just a stand-in until Emma returned. Then I wouldn't need her anymore.""  
  
""But after sending her away, I dreamed about her almost every night.""  
  
""Eventually I couldn't stand her not being near me, so I brought her back as my assistant.""  
  
""I can't live without Emma, but Stella... I can't let her go either.""  
  
""Emma gets my public devotion, while Stella stays in the shadows with a marriage certificate as compensation. What's wrong with that?""  
  
His friend sighed. ""Aren't you afraid Emma will find out? With her personality, if she ever discovers this, you could die at her feet and she'd never look back.""  
  
Dominic fell silent, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed hard. ""Then she'll never find out.""  
  
Emma stood frozen outside the door, feeling her blood turn to ice. She'd expected to break down sobbing, but found she couldn't even squeeze out a tear.  
  
So this was what absolute pain felt like‚Äîlike having your heart carved out while it still beat.  
  
She thought about how Dominic had tenderly kissed her forehead that morning before leaving; how he'd hold her when drunk and murmur, ""Baby, I can't live without you""; how he'd warm her cold hands against his chest, saying his heart beat only for her‚Ä¶  
  
But it was all a lie.  
  
On her way home, she'd even wondered if he had some desperate explanation.  
  
Now she knew‚Äîhe hadn't chosen between two women. He'd wanted both: one as his public beloved, one as his legal wife.  
  
Fine!  
  
If Dominic feared her finding out, she'd show him what ""never looking back"" truly meant.  
  
She turned and left, immediately doing two things...  
  
Chapter 2  
  
First, she applied to cancel all her identity information in the country.  
  
Second, she changed her name.  
  
The clerk informed her all paperwork would be processed within two weeks.  
  
After two weeks, even if Dominic searched heaven and earth, he'd never find her.  
  
Emma turned and left, her phone buzzing frantically in her bag‚Äîall missed calls and messages from Dominic.  
  
She didn't look or respond.  
  
By the time she returned home, night had fallen.  
  
Dominic stood in the living room, rushing toward her the moment she entered, his eyes filled with obvious anxiety: ""Baby, where have you been? I came home and couldn't find you. I've been waiting for hours, nearly turned the whole city upside down looking for you.""  
  
His concern seemed genuine.  
  
Emma stared at him, her heart seized by an invisible hand.  
  
She suddenly remembered high school, when he'd abandoned a math competition mid-exam to rush back when she was an hour late responding to his message, terrified something had happened to her.  
  
A man who clearly loved her so much, someone she once believed saw her as the most important person in his world. Yet looking at everything now, the love he gave was never truly exclusive.  
  
Her throat felt blocked, making every breath painful, but ultimately, she replied calmly, ""I went shopping and forgot to tell you. Sorry.""  
  
Only then did Dominic finally relaxed, pulling her into his arms: ""Don't apologize. I wasn't angry, just worried.""  
  
As he spoke, he kissed the top of her head, his tone gentle: ""Alright baby, you mentioned the other day you were craving those sweet and tangy BBQ ribs and that herb-crusted sea bass. I'll make them for you right now, okay?""  
  
With that, he released her and headed to the kitchen.  
  
Emma stood at the doorway, silently watching Dominic. He rolled up his shirt sleeves, his long fingers skillfully chopping vegetables, his profile looking especially gentle in the warm light.  
  
She suddenly remembered how, three years ago when she first returned, her chronic stomach problems from irregular eating had hospitalized her.  
  
Back then, Dominic‚Äîa billionaire CEO who'd never cooked‚Äîspent a month learning from top chefs to prepare proper meals for her.  
  
Once, when an international video conference clashed with his cooking time, he propped his tablet in the kitchen, listening to reports while stir-frying, shocking his executives.  
  
He once loved her so intensely, as if his entire universe revolved around her.  
  
But right now? The second his phone buzzed, his expression subtly shifted, and he immediately set down the knife, hastily wiping his hands.  
  
""Baby, there's an emergency at the company. I need to go in."" He removed his apron, his tone casual, even remembering to kiss her forehead. ""I've finished three dishes. Eat first, don't wait for me.""  
  
Emma said nothing, just nodded.  
  
After he left, she approached the dining table, looking at the still-steaming dishes, her chest suddenly too painful to breathe.  
  
She'd just seen clearly‚Äîthat call was from Stella.  
  
Instead of sitting down to eat as he'd asked, she called a car and followed him.  
  
Sure enough, Dominic wasn't headed to the company but to the hospital.  
  
In the VIP wing corridor, the entire floor had been cleared, with only a few doctors and nurses standing outside a room, looking tense.  
  
The hospital director was bowing apologetically to Dominic: ""Mr. Chase, we're truly sorry. It was our negligence that allowed Ms. Reed to slip in the bathroom. We'll assign additional staff and ensure this never happens again!""  
  
Dominic's face was grim, his voice icy: ""If there's a next time, this hospital won't stay in business.""  
  
The director nodded repeatedly: ""Yes, yes, we'll be extremely careful!""  
  
Emma stood at the corner, her fingernails digging into her palms.  
  
His friend had mentioned Stella only had ""minor scrapes."" Yet Dominic had reserved an entire building for her, and now that something had happened, he looked ready to tear down the hospital.  
  
The door opened, revealing Stella lying weakly against the headboard, pale-faced with reddened eyes.  
  
Dominic strode over, grabbing her hand: ""How are you? Where does it hurt?""  
  
Stella's eyes welled up, her voice choked: ""This is all my fault. Getting hit by a car was bad enough, but then falling in the shower? Now you can't even spend time with Emma... What if she gets suspicious? I'm like a walking disaster magnet...""  
  
""Don't talk nonsense,"" he scolded, though his tone remained gentle. ""Just focus on recovering. I'll stay with you these next few days.""  
  
Stella looked up with tear-filled eyes: ""But what about Emma?""  
  
Dominic replied dismissively: ""I'll handle it. Don't worry.""  
  
After a pause, he added: ""We're husband and wife. Isn't it natural for me to stay with you?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Emma's blood instantly froze.  
  
Husband and wife? What fine words.  
  
But before she could recover, she watched Dominic remove the prayer beads from his wrist and gently place them on Stella's hand.  
  
""And stop calling yourself a disaster,"" he said. ""These blessed beads‚ÄîI've worn them for seven years. Now they're yours to keep you safe.""  
  
Tears streaming down her face, Stella lunged forward with overwhelming emotion and threw herself into his arms.  
  
Emma stood outside, her vision blurring as if drowning in deep water. Her entire being felt like it was suffocating.  
  
Those prayer beads...  
  
She'd gotten them on her eighteenth birthday, crawling on her knees through the pilgrimage path, performing the traditional prostration every few yards all the way from the mountain base to the abbey summit.  
  
That day, torrential rain had soaked the ground, leaving her knees bleeding and palms raw by the time the abbot finally blessed the beads in the sacred ritual.  
  
When she returned, Dominic saw her battered state and immediately reddened eyes, pulling her into his arms, his voice trembling: ""Emma, have you lost your mind? Who made you suffer like this?""  
  
She'd smiled, placing the beads on his wrist: ""The abbot said these will keep you safe and grant you longevity.""  
  
He'd kissed her, promising: ""I'll wear them for life.""  
  
For seven years, he never removed them. Not during the most formal business occasions, not during their most intimate moments‚Äîthe beads remained on his wrist.  
  
But now, he'd placed them on another woman's hand.  
  
Witnessing this scene with her own eyes, her heart felt like it was being slowly carved open with a dull blade, the pain so intense she could barely breathe.  
  
So his ""lifetime"" had lasted just seven years.  
  
She turned to leave, her steps unsteady as if walking on cotton.  
  
By the time she returned home, night had fallen.  
  
She'd barely entered when her phone vibrated with Dominic's message:  
  
\[Baby, the company has an urgent matter abroad. I'll be gone for a few days. Don't be angry; I'll make it up to you when I return.\]  
  
Emma stared at the screen, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, trembling slightly as she typed:  
  
\[Is it really a few days for business, or a few days with your wife?\]  
  
But ultimately, she deleted the words one by one, tears falling onto the screen, blurring her vision.  
  
After that, she spent the time packing‚Äîdocuments, passport, bank cards... everything that could prove her identity went into her suitcase.  
  
Three days later, Dominic returned.  
  
He pushed open the door carrying a large bouquet of roses and a strawberry cake, smiling tenderly: ""Baby, I'm back.""  
  
Emma stood in the center of the living room, silently watching him.  
  
He approached, placing the flowers and cake on the table, reaching to embrace her: ""Work was incredibly busy these past few days, requiring my presence overseas. Otherwise, I wouldn't have left you for so long. Don't be angry, okay?""  
  
She shifted slightly, avoiding his embrace, her tone flat: ""I'm not angry. Go take care of your business.""  
  
He paused, then smiled: ""I'm done with work. Now my job is to make you happy.""  
  
He took her hand, his eyes expectant: ""I've prepared a surprise for you.""  
  
Without waiting for her response, he led her to the car.  
  
Half an hour later, they stopped before a concert hall.  
  
Emma walked inside to find the entire venue had been reserved, with people seated around, whispering as they entered:  
  
""Mr. Chase really went all out, renting the entire concert hall just for Emma!""  
  
""Word is he flew in her favorite orchestra from Europe‚Äîthey're playing exclusively for her all day long.""  
  
""That ensemble's fee has skyrocketed lately. This must have cost him seven figures, minimum.""  
  
""Please‚Äîthat's nothing. His reputation for spoiling his wife is practically legendary!""  
  
Emma stood in the brilliant light, surrounded by admiring whispers, while Dominic's tender smile filled her vision.  
  
Yet her heart felt submerged in ice water, painfully cold.  
  
He gave her grand gestures and romance, while giving another woman legal marriage.  
  
He let her live in the spotlight of public admiration, while letting another woman exist on his marriage certificate.

1ljz796,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ljz796/my_internship_had_a_file_i_wasnt_supposed_to_open/,My internship had a file I wasn't supposed to open,"Ever since I started college, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do with my education. I had always been interested in software, electronics, and files, so I knew I definitely wanted to work in the tech field. I had coded a few apps and small games but never truly built a great portfolio ‚Äì which is why I was so shocked to see the email in my inbox.

The weeks after graduating had been a blur, waiting to hear back from the handful of places I had applied to with my new degree. Most days, I just sat at my computer, wondering if I had made the right choices in life.¬†

*Was I just going to be stuck‚Ä¶ just another college graduate with nothing to show for it?*

Then, one late-night evening, the email slid into my inbox:

***‚ÄúHello Anthony! We write to you from an up-and-coming company in the tri-state area, Aletheia Systems! Aletheia Systems, in short terms, is a brand new entrepreneurial adventure we decided to start that just aims to make people‚Äôs lives easier:‚Äù***

*‚Ä¶Aletheia Systems‚Ä¶ where have I seen that name?*

***‚ÄúYou may have seen some of our apps out there! Aletheia Systems Journaling, Schedule Easy by Aletheia Systems, etc.‚Äù***

*Is this just some stupid advertisement or what?* I thought to myself as my cursor hovered over the delete button. But something kept me reading on. As my eyes quickly skimmed the words, I realized what the point of the email was.

An internship.

My hands trembled as I clicked ‚ÄòReply.‚Äô I didn‚Äôt even care what the position was or if it was even paid ‚Äî I was going to take this chance, no matter what.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be working with Aletheia Systems!‚Äù I yelled as I ran downstairs to tell my parents, who were busy making dinner.

Little did I know, that single click would change everything ‚Äî and not for the better,

As I pulled up to the mundane Aletheia Systems building, a wave of nervousness hit me. The plain white concrete exterior, with barely any windows and not even a single logo on the outside, gave me a knot in my stomach. I lived about fifteen minutes from the address the email had given me, but I had never seen this building before.

It looked like it had been here for a decade and hadn‚Äôt seen an upgrade since *Flappy Bird* was released.

*Didn‚Äôt they say they were up and coming? How does this building look so old? Why have I never seen this place before?* I thought to myself.

I didn‚Äôt really care, though. I‚Äôd learned shortly after accepting the internship email that the position was paid ‚Äî and handsomely compensated for the amount of work they‚Äôd outlined.

The streets around the Aletheia building were far too quiet for a Monday afternoon. There was a coffee shop across the street with a few patrons sitting in the window. A bus stop stood right outside the building, but it looked like a bus hadn‚Äôt picked anyone up from there in years.

I had to buzz the front door just to get in, which made sense. Most tech companies I‚Äôd seen in the area required ID badges ‚Äî and duh, I didn‚Äôt have one yet.

A loud static buzz came over the intercom so I assumed it was my turn to speak.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ hello?‚Äù

‚ÄúHi! Welcome to Aletheia Systems! What is the purpose of your entrance today?‚Äù

There was a delay ‚Äî a weird seven seconds of silence before she responded. Her voice was awfully cheerful, as if someone had a gun to her head. But I supposed it made sense. She was the first interaction people had with the company.

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ I have an internship with you today?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, Anthony! How wonderful you‚Äôre here. Mr. Avern told me all about our new intern. Please! Come in.‚Äù

Her voice was *too* cheerful, but maybe she really loved working at Aletheia. Still, it was strange ‚Äî too polished, too perky, like a customer service bot trying to sound human.

Would appreciate your insight on the milk forther cup size, I tried searching online and in review videos but couldn‚Äôt find an answer.
If you can please help me understand if theres a difference in the cup size between es701 and es601.
From what I understand, on the es601 i saw it was 8oz, but I heard 701 may have bigger cup?

Im looking for a model that has 12-16oz so I can make 2 cappuccinos at one go.


If you can please write your milk cup size, model, and whether its EU or US it would be of great help.

I've now been to Paris 3 times, and I'm about to spend 10 days there at the beginning of next month. Paris is a GINORMOUS city so even if I've had the opportunity to explore and find nice eating spots etc, there's ALWAYS room to improve and discover something new. Also, I've seen lots of the ""traditional"" museums, but I'd love to go to some smaller art gallery or some hidden gem that you don't usually find in normal guides.

So here I am asking your help:

1) what are your favourite spots for breakfast? I'd love some nice caf√®s, the more local the better, and if you know places where I could find a nice chai latte you'd make me very happy (I absolutely despise coffee).

2) your favourite restaurants? Whatever big or small, but I'd love to avoid touristy/basic stuff and really focus on the one a local (or a very experienced tourist) would find

3) your favourite art spots? I'm talking galleries, smaller museums, but also alleyways, shops etc, where do you go when you want art around you?

4 bonus) your favourite photo spots? I am not really a big instagram girlie (my profile is private, it's just an ""archive"" for my memories) but for that same reason I love having pictures to remember my travels by. I'd like some good spots with a nice background.

1ljz4uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Problem_Solvrs/comments/1ljz4uu/gaming_chair_ergonomic_gaming_chair_for_back_pain/,Gaming Chair: Ergonomic Gaming Chair for Back Pain,"Gaming Chair: My Back (and Productivity) Finally Thank Me!  Ergonomic Multi-Function Winner!

Okay, Reddit, I'm spilling the tea on this amazing gaming chair I finally got after months of searching.  As a work-from-home dad who also loves gaming and dabbles in streaming, I needed a chair that could handle it all. My old chair?  Let's just say it was more medieval torture device than ergonomic seating. My back was screaming, my productivity was tanking, and I was starting to resemble Quasimodo.

So, the quest began.  I dove headfirst into the world of ergonomic gaming chairs, comparing specs, reading reviews (so many reviews!), and generally losing my mind.  I even tried a few that promised the moon and delivered‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say disappointment.  

Then, I found it: a multi-function gaming chair that‚Äôs actually changed my life (or at least, my back pain situation).  This isn't some overpriced gimmick; it's a genuinely comfortable and adjustable chair that's improved my posture, eased my back pain, and even boosted my productivity.  Seriously.

What sold me? The insane adjustability.  You can tweak everything: lumbar support (amazing for my lower back!), headrest, and armrests.  I can adjust the height, the recline, even the armrest width. It's like it was designed by a committee of back-pain-suffering, gaming-obsessed, work-from-home dads. üòÇ

The multi-functional design is a game-changer. I use this chair for everything: long gaming sessions (yes, even those 12-hour marathons!), hours of work on my laptop, and even relaxing with a good book or movie.  No more switching between chairs ‚Äì this one does it all. That's a huge win for my sanity and my back.

The biggest surprise? How much it improved my posture.  I used to slump like a melting candle, but this chair encourages me to sit up straight.  I've noticed a real difference in my energy levels and focus. I'm getting more done in less time.  I'd estimate my productivity has gone up by at least 10-15%, maybe even more.  That's a pretty significant return on investment, right?

The build quality is fantastic. This isn't some flimsy thing that'll fall apart after a few months. It feels incredibly sturdy and well-made. I'm confident this chair will last for years.  It's a long-term investment, not a quick fix.  That means I won't be replacing this anytime soon, saving me money in the long run.

I know what you're thinking: ""Sounds too good to be true.""  I thought the same thing! But after weeks of using it, I'm a true believer. The comfort is unbelievable, the adjustability is mind-blowing, and the multi-functional design is incredibly convenient. It's fixed my back pain, improved my posture, and boosted my productivity.  What more could I ask for?  Maybe a built-in coffee maker? ü§î  Just kidding (mostly).

I got this amazing chair from ursupermart.com, and I‚Äôm seriously considering getting a second one for my wife.  She‚Äôs been eyeing it ever since I got mine.  If you're looking for an ergonomic gaming chair that's also great for work and relaxation, I highly recommend checking this one out.  It's seriously a lifesaver.

This chair has been a total game-changer for my workflow. Before, I'd constantly fidget, trying to find a comfortable position, losing valuable time and focus. Now, I can easily adjust the lumbar support, headrest, and armrests to perfectly fit my needs, whether I'm working on a project, streaming a game, or just relaxing with a movie. The increased comfort has directly translated to improved concentration and efficiency. I'm getting more done in less time, and that's a huge win for a busy work-from-home dad. The adjustable height is also a key feature; I can easily adjust the chair to fit my desk perfectly, ensuring proper posture and preventing strain.  This is something I didn't fully appreciate until I experienced it.

Here‚Äôs the link if you‚Äôre curious: https://go.ursupermart.com/rnRvzP

I've also found that the chair's breathable fabric helps keep me cool during long gaming sessions, which is a huge plus.  I used to get so sweaty and uncomfortable, but this chair has completely changed that.  It's little things like that which make a big difference.  Plus, the sleek design looks great in my home office.  It doesn't look like a clunky gaming chair; it's stylish and professional.

Another unexpected benefit is that my kids actually fight less over who gets to sit in it!  It's become a bit of a family favorite, which is a bonus I didn't anticipate.  I guess a comfortable chair is a universal language. üòä

Seriously, do yourself a favor and check it out. You won't regret it. This is a long-term investment in your comfort and well-being. Plus, think of all the extra time you'll gain from increased productivity! It's a win-win, really. And your back will thank you. üòâ

The multi-functional design is a lifesaver. I use this chair for everything: long gaming sessions (even those 12-hour marathons!), hours of work on my laptop, and even relaxing with a good book or movie. I don't need separate chairs anymore. This one chair does it all. That alone is worth its weight in gold (or at least, in reduced back pain).

One thing that surprised me was how much it improved my posture. I used to slump all day, but this chair encourages me to sit up straight. I've noticed a real difference in my energy levels and focus. I'm more productive, and my back feels way better. I'd say my productivity has gone up by at least 10-15%, maybe even more.

1ljz2yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ljz2yk/throwaway_short_storythoughts/,Throwaway short story--thoughts?,"The boy was hunched in the doorway. He stood wretchedly, and Charlie looked at him, wretched too. He pushed back the hood: hearing aids in, no bruises on the boy's pinched, toplit face. He pulled him into a tight hug, firmly clapping him on the back, and then they were both inside the little box of an apartment.

""Are you hurt? Let's calm down a little, Quinn."" Charlie worked as he spoke, unzipping the boy's hoodie and shifting him towards the dim kitchen, pulling down a glass from the cupboard and filling it with tapwater, reaching into the fridge to get something for himself. 

He stayed like that for a time, with the door open, letting the cold air cleanse his panic. In the yellow fridge light, bruises revealed themselves on Quinn's pale neck. He watched them dance as the boy gulped down the water. 

The living situation was not good; he knew this. He'd left before it could be made clearer to him just how ""not good"" things could get, and the guilt led him to do stupid things, like opening the door in the middle of the night.

Charlie waited.

""I'm sorry,"" Quinn's voice was thin and rumpled. He leaned heavily against the wall, as if the weight of the glass in his hand was his tipping point, and Charlie suddenly had the feeling that this boy was much older than the boy he'd left behind. ""Dad kicked me out. I'll be able to go back in a few days, you know he how comes around, but...""

As his voice trailed off, Charlie put his beer back on its shelf, and closed the fridge.

They sat. Quinn's glass rattled against the the surface of the coffee table as he put it down. His whole body was one big shiver as he launched into the story, and Charlie found himself not listening as much as he felt he should have. The edges of the story were frayed by Quinn's exhaustion, and Charlie's empathy enervated by time and distance.

The story was this: words were exchanged, blows were exchanged, and a door was closed firmly behind him. A different story than usual. One sided was how things usually went, and, always, Quinn was on the receiving end.

""He called her a bitch,"" Quinn said.

Charlie waited.

""He called her a bitch... and some other stuff."" 

Charlie nodded. ""Alright. Shower in the morning. The office is how you left it. There's more blankets in the ottoman."" 

\*

As he put out his cigarette, Charlie noted the time. *No school today, Quinn,* he thought to himself. He wouldn't push Quinn. When he made his own escape there was no one to push him, he thought. A man pushes himself.

He found Quinn in the kitchen, back turned to him, lit by a grayish glow from the westfacing window, and as he washed the smoke from his hands he thought out loud. He talked about how their mother had been when Quinn was littler, how she'd wear red or white polish on her nails and how she'd wiggle them at him, the nails; how she would tap on hard surfaces for him to feel the vibrations; how she'd picked up sign language like a forgotten tool, like a pair of neglected safety scissors rather than a fresh out of the box syntax. He turned to find Quinn disappeared from the room, and found him again in the living room hunched over a bowl of cereal, hearing aids nowhere in sight.

He thumped over indignantly, letting his footfalls signal his approach, and signed, ""I told you to bring your charger the last time you pulled this.""

Quinn, mouth and hands full, only raised his eyebrows, as if to ask how exactly he might have packed a bag, under the circumstances.

Charlie fought an eye roll. He hated when the kid tried to be funny at his expense, but he would cut him some slack today. ""I'll call the office up there to have them excuse you.""

Quinn shook his head. He chewed, swallowed, put down the bowl. ""No,"" he signed. ""Too many absences. Track after school. Test in third period.""

Charlie's hand rose to the bridge of his nose, worked away at the feature that they shared. A sinus headache was building under the skin. All across his forehead, between his eyes, was a mounting pressure. A deep breath never did help, but he took one anyway.

""What time am I picking you up."" Not a question.

Quinn was silent, chewing again, but watching Charlie's face.

""You're not walking. Use Coach's phone before practice so I know when to come.""

Quinn turned his eyes back to his cereal. He was still in the hoodie and jeans from the night before.

\*

The ride was short and taciturn. Charlie's car spoke more than the two brothers, muttering as he took the potholes in the road without slowing.

""Good to see the city's kept its charm,"" Charlie said. As he stopped, one street over from the school, he locked the doors, and concealed a smile as Quinn tried the handle. He put on a serious face. ""Call me before practice starts.""

Quinn gave a small nod, the fight gone out of him for now, but Charlie pushed a little further.

""You know I have to let her know you're here?""

Quinn was silent and still. His face said nothing. And Charlie unlocked door.

As he drove off, he found none of the usual correspondence on his phone. None of the secret, worried texts from their mother, verifying Quinn's frequent flightpath had led him to Charlie. No written or spoken threats from her SOB husband. At a red light, he hesitated with his thumb over his mother's name. He pulled a cigarette from the pack instead, letting it rest unlit in his mouth as he decided.

\*

His mother stood in the doorway, straight as pin and more sharp. Her hair was pulled back bravely. She wore a turtleneck, a browbone shiner, and no nail polish at all. ""Everything is fine,"" she said, and the bruised eyebrow quivered in assent.

""Everything is fine,"" Charlie echoed, mockery in his voice despite his efforts. He hated to see her like this. But she did it to herself. 

""Antonio needs a few days to cool off. Quinn has to learn when it's a bad time to butt in. And to stay out of adults' business."" The words were flat, a rote recitation. Her mouth was tight, and she kept her hand on the knob of the closed door behind her.

""What are you even talking about? Have you seen him? He's got 'adults' business' tattooed around his fucking throat. Big handprint,"" he slapped his own neck,"" right here. If he unzips that hoodie you'll be lucky if you don't see the truancy officer before the week is out.""

His mother looked through him, waiting for him to finish. From behind her, through the closed front door, there came the sounds of a scorned thing skulking about, looking for a left sock, grumbling over coffee. Charlie thought that if that thing came just a bit closer, made just a bit more noise, he might push right past his mother, thin as petal, and trample it to death. But the thing retreated further into the house, as if it could feel the vibrations of Charlie, his anger a warning plume, and he found himself screaming at a woman, watching her wilt, and retreating to his car to beat the steering wheel and cover his own face in his hands.

GUESS WHO'S DINNER NOW Novel All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty‚ÄîEvery new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn.","Chapter 1

All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty‚ÄîEvery new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn. Only those who emerged unharmed the next morning were considered blessed by the Forrester ancestors.

What once had been just a formality turned into a nightmare when Callum Forrester, the current heir, took a bride.

His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted.

Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself.

Later, Callum married seven more times over the years, and horrifyingly, each bride met the same fate on her wedding night in that chapel.

Police investigations yielded nothing conclusive, and each death was eventually ruled a suicide.

Rumors spread throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome claimed the Forrester estate was haunted, others whispered about dark rituals. No family would risk sending their daughter there anymore.

But today, I stood before Mrs. Forrester in a crimson dress, my posture graceful yet determined.

""Mr. Forrester is exceptionally handsome,"" I said. ""I've admired him from afar for years. I'm willing to be his ninth wife.""

I looked her directly in the eyes. ""Don't worry. Your ancestors may not have liked the others, but they'll certainly like me.""

\---

My family ran a small bakery on York Avenue.

Before dawn each morning, my sister would help our parents with the work‚Äîkneading dough, preparing fillings, making pastries, brewing coffee. She excelled at everything and never let me help.

""Melody, you're meant for academics,"" she would say. ""Just focus on your studies.""

""We'll support you all the way to success!""

Eight years ago, on the day I was announced as Manhattan's valedictorian.

My sister, dressed in a pristine white gown, shyly boarded the luxurious wedding car sent by the Forrester family.

Everyone envied her good fortune. While serving coffee one morning, she had somehow caught the eye of Callum Forrester, heir to the family fortune, and was now marrying into wealth and privilege.

I was happy for her too, not because of the Forrester fortune, but because of the shy, joyful look on her face before she left:

""Melody, don't worry about me. Callum is truly kind, and his family has been welcoming,"" she said, holding my hands. ""I need to fly higher so you can go further. You'll always be the sister I'll protect with everything I have!""

That night, I dreamed my sister had a beautiful baby who called me ""Auntie"" in the sweetest voice while clutching my shirt.

But the next morning, the shocking news of my sister's death shattered our world.

I raced to the Forrester estate, arriving just as they carried her out on a crude stretcher.

My sister's once delicate hands were now bruised and gray. Her fingertips were bloody, all ten nails forcibly torn off, the flesh raw and mangled.

Despite everyone's attempts to stop me, I yanked back the sheet covering her.

Her death was horrifying‚Äîa gaping wound across her throat, her body twisted unnaturally, her eyes bulging like a fish's.

Her pristine white gown was soaked through with blood, a pool of it staining the stretcher beneath her.

I felt the world spinning as I collapsed to the ground.

But then I heard my father's sickeningly servile tone as he kowtowed to Callum.

""This terrible incident must be Victoria's fault‚Äîshe simply wasn't worthy of the Forrester ancestors' blessing.""

""Mr. Forrester, you're young and successful. You'll definitely find a much better wife in the future. Please don't waste your grief on someone so worthless!""

Though we weren't wealthy, my father had always been kind to us sisters, never speaking harshly to either of us.

When relatives once mocked him for having ""worthless daughters,"" he had grabbed a kitchen knife and confronted them.

Now I couldn't believe these words were coming from his mouth.

""Who would've thought I'd marry a mental case? Killing herself in the chapel on our wedding day‚Äîwhat terrible luck!""

""Get rid of her quickly. The sight is giving me a headache.""

Callum's face was dark with annoyance, showing no grief or pain as he turned to leave.

My sister treasured life above all else and had promised to protect me forever‚Äîhow could she possibly have committed suicide?!

Red-eyed, I moved to confront them, only to be struck hard across the face by my father.

""It's your sister's fault for not being fortunate enough to marry into such a good family!""

""Stop embarrassing yourself and come home with me now!""

I saw stars from the impact as my father dragged me away amid the whispers and stares of onlookers.

The incident caused an uproar throughout Manhattan, prompting a special investigation team from the state.

Shockingly, the conclusion matched Callum's claim‚Äîmy sister had committed suicide.

The Forrester estate had stringent security, and all surveillance footage was perfectly preserved. The recordings clearly showed that after my sister entered the chapel, no one else went in. The audio recordings captured even the sound of mosquitoes flying but recorded no screams.

Chapter 2

Outside the chapel doors and windows, everything remained peaceful until the next morning when Callum and his mother opened the door and discovered my sister's body.

The medical examiner carefully checked every suspicious detail and ruled out homicide.

Everyone calmly accepted this conclusion‚Äîeveryone except me.

After spending the summer break crying, I enrolled at Princeton University as planned.

Not because I cared about my future, but because it had been my sister's greatest wish for me.

I abandoned the popular finance major and instead chose the obscure field of criminal investigation.

After completing my undergraduate studies, I continued with a combined master's and doctoral program. I studied harder than anyone, terrified of missing any knowledge that might help me solve the mystery of my sister's death.

Eight years later, I returned to Manhattan again.

Much had happened with the Forrester family during my absence. After my sister, Callum had married seven more wives.

These seven women came from vastly different backgrounds, with varied appearances and personalities.

Yet each bride had died by apparent suicide in the family chapel on her wedding night.

Particularly noteworthy was the eighth wife, married just six months ago‚ÄîDarla Thompson, a butcher's daughter from the marketplace. She weighed nearly 300 pounds and was strong enough to knock out a grown man with one punch, with a notoriously volatile temper.

Her father had gambling debts of $500,000, and the Forresters, desperate for a bride, had promised her $20 million in cash and ten commercial properties in Marina City if she survived the night.

Darla tried‚Äîbut didn't make it out alive.

Callum had attempted to persuade his family to abandon the chapel ritual, but Mrs. Forrester insisted it was a tradition passed down through generations that could not be broken.

This led to rumors spreading throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome said the Forrester estate was haunted by malevolent spirits determined to end the family line; others whispered that the Forresters were sacrificing brides to feed otherworldly beings in exchange for their incredible wealth.

Whatever the truth, no family across the country was willing to send their daughter there anymore.

Yet on my second day back in Manhattan, I dressed in a striking crimson dress, applied flawless makeup, and appeared at the Forrester estate's entrance.

""Tell your mistress I'm willing to be Callum Forrester's ninth wife.""

News of my request to marry Callum spread through Manhattan like wildfire.

Though Manhattan wasn't small, gossip traveled faster than any virus.

""I heard Melody Vincent just returned yesterday and is already offering to marry Callum Forrester. Both sisters are just gold-diggers!""

""Poor Mr. Vincent‚Äîhe used to brag about how brilliant his daughter was, but look at her now, falling at the feet of money just like her sister.""

""Money aside, those Forrester rumors should give anyone pause. Looks like the Vincent family might lose both daughters to that cursed place!""

Everyone in Manhattan branded me as a shallow gold-digger.

The fact that I was a Princeton graduate with a doctorate made the contrast all the more shocking and thrilling to them.

Inside the Forrester estate, Mrs. Forrester had me brought to her.

""Melody Vincent, do you truly want to marry my son?"" she asked, studying me with interest.

""More certain than gold is pure!"" I replied with a smile.

""Everyone knows Mr. Forrester is refined, gentle, and friendly‚Äînot to mention his net worth recently surpassed ten billion. What reason could I possibly have not to like him?""

Mrs. Forrester responded with a cold laugh.

""I knew you couldn't genuinely care for Callum!""

The disgust in her eyes was unmistakable.

But I knew she had no choice.

""Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush,"" she said.

""You haven't forgotten what happened to your sister in our family chapel eight years ago, have you?""

""During the eight years you've been away, a new bride has died in that chapel each year. What makes you think you'll live longer than they did?""

Chapter 3

Mrs. Forrester's piercing gaze fixed on me.

I smiled faintly.

""Don't worry, Mrs. Forrester. I'm different from those ordinary women. Your ancestors may not have liked them, but they'll certainly approve of me!""

I stared back at her with proud confidence.

She studied me for a long time before finally nodding in agreement.

""Go prepare yourself. Only by surviving tonight can you prove you're different from the others!""

She dismissed me with a wave.

I smiled, knowing all truths would be revealed tonight!

When I returned home, my parents were already waiting.

""What madness is this? Who gave you permission to agree to marry Callum Forrester?!"" My father's face was flushed with anger.

My mother anxiously wiped away tears, her eyes filled with sorrow as she looked at me.

But as I faced my father, I felt nothing.

""Since when have you cared who I marry?"" I asked, staring into his eyes.

""What nonsense! Why wouldn't I care? Don't you know about the Forrester rumors? Going there is practically suicide! Are you trying to put me and your mother in an early grave?""

My father desperately tried to make me see reason.

But I only coldly asked: ""If you truly cared, you wouldn't have let Victoria die in vain back then.""

My father's entire body trembled, his lips quivering.

""Melody, don't speak to your father like that. Your father‚Ä¶"" my mother began.

""Shut up!"" he snapped harshly when my mother tried to defend him.

Then he glared at me intensely.

""Fine, since you've made your decision, I won't interfere anymore.""

""From this day forward, you are no longer my daughter!""

My father drove me from the house despite my mother's desperate pleas, but he remained unmoved.

After leaving, I bowed deeply toward my parents' home.

""Dad, Mom, your daughter has been unfilial.""

""If I can uncover the truth, I promise I'll return to care for you properly!""

I whispered before turning toward the end of the alley.

Callum's wedding procession was even more extravagant than eight years ago‚Äîa line of Rolls-Royces that anyone would envy.

""Well, that's it for the Vincent family line!""

""All those years of fancy education, and that Princeton doctorate isn't worth squat, is it?""

The neighbors lining the alley had all come out to mock me with their cruel taunts.

Yet I boarded the car without hesitation.

The procession moved slowly, taking half an hour to reach the vicinity of the Forrester family chapel.

But when we were still about five hundred yards from the chapel, the driver refused to go any further.

""Miss Vincent, may God be with you. We wouldn't go near that place even if you killed us,"" the driver said, turning to me.

I nodded slightly, then got out and looked ahead.

Perhaps it was the poor weather, or perhaps the area truly was heavy with malevolent energy, but the summer night suddenly felt bone-chillingly cold.

The dark alley ahead resembled a path to hell, yet I walked forward with determined steps.

A few minutes later, I stood before the Forrester family chapel.

The door creaked open, and Mrs. Forrester stood in the entrance beckoning to me.

Perhaps it was her overly pale makeup, but I couldn't shake the impression she resembled a paper effigy.

Mrs. Forrester thrust a prayer book into my hands.

""Go. Recite the prayers,"" she instructed coldly.

""Read them through once, then again. I advise you not to fall asleep‚Äîotherwise... well, who knows what might happen.""

Her eyes held a strange mixture of contempt and pity as she looked at me.

Beside her, Callum emerged from the chapel with several others.

He glanced at me dismissively.

""Your sister was much prettier than you, but it doesn't matter now. I'd marry a pig if it survived the night!""

Callum's face was filled with arrogance.

I silently clenched my fists.

I remained convinced that Callum had done something to my sister!

Now my enemy stood before me, yet I could do nothing‚Äîthe frustration was unbearable.

""May I enter now?"" I asked, looking at Mrs. Forrester.

She didn't speak, merely gesturing for someone to open the inner doors of the chapel.

I walked step by step toward the unknown abyss, my heart growing heavier with each step.

The door slowly closed behind me.

As the last sliver of light disappeared, I found myself in complete darkness.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, candles on the walls ignited, their flickering light making everything around me seem eerily distorted.

My heart raced involuntarily, especially when I first glimpsed the portraits of Forrester ancestors on the walls‚Äîmy fear reached its peak.

Ahead, memorial tablets were arranged neatly, with a prayer mat placed on the floor.

I took a deep breath, gathering my courage to approach, kneeling on the mat.

Then I opened the prayer book, trying to calm myself.

But just as I prepared to begin reciting, something suddenly occurred to me.

""Let me out! Let me out right now!""

""I know what's happening!""

""I know why all those brides died mysteriously!""",1,1750835441.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1. Long time no see! üëã 


Hi guys, it‚Äôs me again. 25F Chinese living in Canada. Estranged from my family in China for half a year. Had a staff from Chinese Embassy visited my apartment to check up on me right after. I received so many replies and likes after I posted that experience. I want to thank everyone for your support, advice and kindness. It helped me feel so safe and confident in my decision. 

After that post, I sometimes get recognized by some other Reddit user when I reply to their post. They would say ‚ÄòI remember you, I saw your post, I support you, or even ‚ÄòI hope I can also go NC and heal one day‚Äô. Seeing the impact of me sharing my authentic experience, I really want to give an update. I hope this can help others feel less alone, more connected, and maybe even more hopeful.

2. Going NC was scary. Physical stress. Existential crisis. üòµ‚Äçüí´


Going NC was really hard. It was the hardest the decision I ever made.

I sit on the toilet the whole night after I blocked my parents everywhere. My body kept shaking and my nerve system was panicking, fear and anxiety over the roof‚Ä¶ it felt like I was going to stop existing. Am I alive or dead? I was an adult who had lived in 2 different countries alone, but separate myself from my parents still gave me so much physical distress, like a kid who couldn‚Äôt survive without their parents. 


Mental wise, breaking the enmeshment was also extremely scary. All my life I had been in survival mode, doing whatever it took to please my parents. I had developed so many coping mechanisms, internalized so much shame and criticism, always put other people‚Äôs feelings and needs before mine or I would feel scared and guilty‚Ä¶ all of that, just to survive.


Who am I ?

What is my worth without my parent‚Äôs approval?

What do I like?

How do I want to live? How do I want my day to be like?


There were so many problems I had to find answers from my heart but I didn‚Äôt even dare to think about. Though I tried my best to be avoidant, deep down I was having a silent existential crisis. I could hear 100 different voices of my abusers telling me how worthless and burdensome I was bc I took the wrong path of NC. I knew I had to ignore their standards of my worth but‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs my new standard? I didn‚Äôt know. I just felt very lost and scared.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

3. The first 3 month after NC. Work! üí™

I was lucky (or desperate, not-able-to-function) enough to be healing full time in the first 3 months.
These are the things I spend all my time awake doing: 

1) cry in bed and grieve my childhood, process emotions that felt strong and important; 

2) read other survivors‚Äô post on Reddit to get inspired + share my thoughts with lovely internet strangers;

3) read all the recommended psychology books for family scapegoat; 

4) talk to a trauma therapist (NARM Certified) every week and work on my therapy notes between sessions; 

5) deal with panic attacks whenever I realize something scary. 
(Panic attacks were the worst. It felt like the end of the world over and over again)

P.s. Thanks to myself for dropping Uni and use that tuition money for therapy, ADHD assessment and medication, dentist visits‚Ä¶ instead üòÇ (I had a pretty bad insurance and all these services were very expensive. I gotta do what I gotta do when it comes to stop neglecting my health.)

        As an Asian kid, grinding through a stem degree is always more important than anything else. But at that point IGDAF. Panic attacks were killing me. I just wanted to survive. I would to give up anything to get mentally better and have less frequent panic attacks üòÇüòÇüòÇ)

4. A heartfelt moment ‚òÄÔ∏èü™¶üå≥‚ù§Ô∏è

One day in the beginning of spring I was on a random ride outside. I let the window down and saw the sun shining above a cemetery. The wind was gentle, trees were green and tall, the marble gravestones reflected the sunlight into the space above them, creating a peaceful atmosphere. I heard my own voice in my head saying ‚ÄòIt feels so good to just live life without feeling ashamed.‚Äô


Since then, I started to face the shame and learn to embrace my true self behind the shame‚Ä¶ to respect and follow my inner voice, and to debate my parents toxic criticism in my head and throw the blame back on them. 


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

5. Life changes drastically (accumulated) ‚ùì‚ùóÔ∏èüí∞üçï


Slowly but steadily I got better at feeling my feelings. (lol sounds weird. But if u have Cptsd u understand) By listening and following my inner voice, I see myself making healthy changes and exercising my autonomy. 

1) I pick up old hobbies like journaling and yoga. They help me connect with my younger-self with gratitude and compassion.
 (Gosh it feels so good to finally enjoy my hobbies again without the feelings of guilt and shame after a whole decade)

2) I try to meal prep on the weekends so I can have an easier time next week. I follow a dietician‚Äôs recipe to  cook healthy and nutritious meals.

3) I explore the possibilities of self-employment in creative industries, to accommodate my neurodiversity and CPTSD. 

4) I move from downtown to the suburbs for space, quietness and nature. 

5) I start to seriously follow a weight training program to build strength and feel safer in my body‚Ä¶ 

6) I‚Äôm able to clean the house and organize my stuff way better 

None of these things were possible if my parents are still in my life. I would only get shamed and punished for wanting things. 

For a long time I felt like such a failed adult bc I had no clue how to fix ‚Äòsimple life problems‚Äô like retail therapy and binge eating. Now I see how my parents enabled my binge eating habits since I was 14 and sabotaged my job opportunities since I was 18. üò≠But yeah, after half a year of NC, I stop binge eating completely, and keep up with my spendings pretty well. I have better things to do than eating so I just eat something simple then go back to do fun stuff and chill. Seeing my BMI getting better every week and my spendings serving my true purposes every end of the month makes me feel so in control of my life.

Sometimes when I walk in my clean and organized home, I suddenly remember that as a kid, our home was like a pile of trash. Mom was a hoarder who would scream at anyone for suggesting to throw away or donate something. Dirty plastic bags and bottles squeezed into every cracks of space. 

Like, how? This is my life. And that was my life, too. How can they be so different?!! I guess I am in charge of my own life now. Wow?????!!!!!! ü§Ø

6. Social life and Relationship üï∫

I‚Äôm still feeling like an introvert. I would still get triggered by socializing with people I don‚Äôt know sometimes. I don‚Äôt like it but I can handle it better now. I have a small group of family and friends who I feel safe and warm around. Sometimes I go to a coffee shop just to get surrounded by strangers who are enjoying their drinks. This feels like a good way of socializing. Even though I don‚Äôt talk to anyone, I feel connected because we‚Äôre all enjoying our time.

My partner and I are together for one and a half year. (My mom tried to sabotage us after the half year mark. ) I don‚Äôt get the butterflies in my stomach feeling anymore when I see him. But whenever I get lost in a shame spiral that all I want to do is lying in bed all day, neglecting my own needs and just feeling depressed, he would look really hurt and try hard to be there for me. Somehow I would feel like ‚Äòyeah there‚Äôs always someone who deserves my authentic self, even when I don‚Äôt think I deserve to be authentic.‚Äò Then I somehow just have the energy and motivation to get out of the bed to take care of myself and go on with my day. I don‚Äôt understand this but I like it üòÇüòÇ

...And I still don't understand how I deserve someone like that.

Every Saturday morning she wakes me up with kisses, smiles and says, ""Let's go to breakfast, we have a croissant meeting."" It's already her tradition to have breakfast at a cafe in nice weather. We go to our favorite cafe, order croissants, coffee and ""it"" begins.

She pulls out a notebook. A small one with a helloy kitty cover. And starts writing in the notebook the moments of the week that she's grateful for. Right in front of me. No pathos. Just:

- ""Thank you for coming to meet me at work yesterday.""
- ""Thank you for being kind and caring.""
- ""Thank you for putting up with my bouts of aggression and negativity.""

And then she puts down her pen, smiles, and says, ""Now it's your turn.""

And I start writing her something, but I don't even know what to write. Sometimes it's cute. Sometimes it's funny. Sometimes I just draw a heart and sign it, ""Thank you for being there."" And sometimes I write vulgar things like I want to lock myself in a cafe bathroom with her and make love to her.

No one knows about it. It's just a private thing. The people in the cafe probably think we're doing crossword puzzles, but really - we're collecting our little thank yous like a photo album, only in words.

I don't know why or why not I'm writing this. I guess just to say - if you think the little things aren't important, they are. Someone can change your day, your week, your life with one sentence in a notebook.

Overall experience:- 8/10 ü¶öüåøüçï‚öΩ

As a newly opened cafe the food was tasty as well the service was quite fast. Pricing wise it was cheap as the target audience is students. The cafe has a laid back and relaxing vibe which makes the overall ambience more peaceful. The serene feels in the evening or morning and soothing peacock squawks just adds up to that. Feels like you're sitting amid nature , as the arai tekdi is right beside it.  Also the cafe is right next to a turf . 

Let's talk about the food :- üßÄüçïü•ûü•§

1. Nutella fruit pancakes ü•û:- 8/10 
Ample amount of fruit which were sweet and citrusy at the same time ,and the nutella taste balancing the overall dish .  With that the pancakes were also sweet and has their own flavour . Although I feel the nutella amount shouldve been some moree .  


2. Paneer (something) pizza üçï:- 7/10 

Im not a big fan of pizza and haven't tried much , but this had a soft crust , perfectly cooked , with soft moist paneer and the smoked flavour of barbeque sauce made it more tangy and falvour full . 


3. Cold coffee and kitkat shakeü•§ :- 6.5/10 both 

In my words the beverages had zero ( ‡§≠‡•á‡§∏‡§≥) 
The consistency was thin like milk and made it drinkable as the flavours were enhanced . 
Though , coffee had  less sugar and kit kat was a bit on sweeter side rather than chocolatey.


4. Loaded NachosüßÄ :- 7/10 

It was loaded with cheese and other veggies with salsa and some sauces . For me the veggie part was a bit more. But it was cheesey and tangy . 


5. Masala Chai ‚òï :- I didn't try so I don't know ü•π 

But the smell was soo good , the spice aroma ü§åüèªü§åüèª also it was raining ü•π so sone pe suhaga .

Chapter 1  
  
On Juneteenth, the most viral TikTok was about me.  
  
The caption read: ""Tycoon Rhys Harmon Takes Son to Celebrate His True Love's Birthday‚ÄîIs He Finally Divorcing Viv?""  
  
I quietly hit repost. And then started taking down the balloons I'd prepared for our wedding anniversary.  
  
Within minutes, my phone was buzzing non-stop.  
  
""Honey,"" my husband's voice was panicked, ""I saw your post - let me explain. Our son kept begging to go to the Freedom Festival, so I...""  
  
In the background, our son's voice rang out cheerfully: ""Daddy, Auntie Mel says I can sleep over at her house tonight!""  
  
I surveyed the wreckage around me.  
  
The balloons had deflated from waiting all day, the anniversary cake's frosting dried and cracked from sitting untouched.  
  
""Don't bother explaining,"" I heard myself say, ""I understand everything.""  
  
But Rhys, this time‚Äî  
  
I'm done with both of you.  
  
...  
  
I was curled up on the couch watching TV when Rhys walked through the door with our son.  
  
In the past, I would have rushed over immediately to take his coat, then kissed my son's little cheeks.  
  
But today, I didn't move a muscle.  
  
""Mommy, why aren't you coming to kiss me today?"" my son whined.  
  
""Viv, why aren't you taking my coat?"" Rhys added, his tone casual but pointed.  
  
I just turned up the volume on the TV. ""Too busy.""  
  
Hearing this, Rhys composed himself as he hung up his coat and removed the Mickey Mouse hat from our son's head, placing it on the rack.  
  
Then he turned to me with a sigh: ""Viv, you can't seriously still be sulking about that minor thing, can you?""  
  
""Our son suddenly wanted to go to the Freedom Festival, and I couldn't exactly ruin his excitement, could I? Since I couldn't handle him alone, I asked Melody to come along. How many more times do I need to explain this?""  
  
Our son, standing nearby, huffed angrily, ""Mommy, you're being weird again! Auntie Mel never makes grumpy faces like you do!""  
  
Rhys patted our son's head before turning his gaze back to me.  
  
""See that? Even our son can't stand your attitude, Viv, why can't you understand? When I try to appease you, I'm doing you a favor. If you're going to throw tantrums, could you at least show some restraint?""  
  
""I'm not angry,"" I replied, my voice unnervingly steady. ""I understand everything.""  
  
In fact, I couldn't understand more clearly.  
  
Like last year, when I was bleeding out after my car accident, and he impatiently told me over the phone, ""I've got something urgent to handle. I'll come later‚Äîjust call an ambulance yourself!""  
  
Meanwhile, our son was shouting in the background: ""Daddy, come quick! We found Auntie Mel's kitten! Hurry up and come comfort her so she stops crying!""  
  
So, I had to lie in a pool of my own blood, dialing 911 myself.  
  
In the ambulance, the EMT asked if there was any family they could contact, and I replied with a trembling voice, ""I have no family.""  
  
While I was in loss, Rhys's eyes scanned my face repeatedly before he finally exhaled wearily.  
  
""Viv, do you really have to be like this?""  
  
I met his gaze steadily. ""Like what?""  
  
Silence crystallized in the air between us.  
  
Suddenly, he pulled a velvet box from his briefcase and tossed it carelessly onto the couch.  
  
""Here. Happy anniversary.""  
  
I glanced at the necklace inside the box, noticing the pendant engraved with the letters ""ML""‚ÄîMelody's initials.  
  
I couldn't help but smirk bitterly.  
  
Even my anniversary gift was someone else's leftovers.  
  
Yet on Melody's birthday, he'd spent an entire afternoon with our son at the bakery, making her cake from scratch, though he'd never cooked before.  
  
""Thanks,"" I said, my voice emotionless.  
  
Rhys jumped to his feet. ""Our son and I carefully picked this out for you, and you can't even smile? Don't you like it?""  
  
I traced the glaring ""ML"" on the pendant: ""I like it. Thank you.""  
  
Suddenly, his expression looked like he'd been struck by lightning.  
  
After all, in the past, no matter what gift he gave me‚Äîeven if it was just corporate swag from company events‚ÄîI'd treasure it like a priceless artifact and sweetly say, ""Thank you, honey.""  
  
Every single time, for years, without fail.  
  
Even for our anniversaries, I'd start preparing three months in advance‚Äîcustom photo albums, video montages‚Äîeven flying to whatever city he was working in to surprise him.  
  
But now? Hah!  
  
I stood up from the sofa, tossed the box into the trash can without a second thought, and headed for the door.  
  
When my hand barely touched the doorknob, Rhys suddenly grabbed my arm, clearly annoyed. ""Viv, where the hell are you going this late? Our son is waiting for you to tuck him in.""  
  
I looked at him, almost amused. ""That's funny, Rhys.""  
  
""When I used to ask where you were going at 3 AM, you told me I had boundary issues.""  
  
""Now that I've stopped asking, you're even angrier and checking up on me instead.""  
  
With that, I walked straight out the door.  
  
As the door clicked shut behind me, I heard his suppressed roar:  
  
""Always with the drama! If you don't come back tonight, don't bother coming back at all!""  
  
His voice carried the certainty that I'd turn back, afraid of losing everything.  
  
But I didn't break stride, my eyes filled with contempt.  
  
In his mind, I'd always be that pathetic clown‚Äîdesperate, dependent, with no other options.  
  
But even clowns get tired of their masks.  
  
This marriage had become too suffocating.  
  
So‚ÄîI chose to quit.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
In the bar, my cousin raised her glass and teased me, ""Well, this is a surprise! Our family's perfect little housewife isn't at home waiting on her 'king' and 'prince'? What happened?""  
  
""You're too young to be this nosy,"" I laughed, playfully pushing her shoulder. ""Just remember to invite me next time something fun comes up.""  
  
My cousin scoffed, ""Like you'd ever leave your precious boys behind.""  
  
I couldn't blame her dismissiveness.  
  
Because during these years with Rhys, I'd turned myself into an isolated island.  
  
Friends' invitations to gatherings? ""Maybe next time,"" I'd always say.  
  
My half-finished oil paintings on the easel? Buried under thick layers of dust.  
  
Even my favorite bookstore‚ÄîI hadn't visited in ages.  
  
With this, I downed my drink in one go. ""Actually, I can leave them behind.""  
  
If they could discard me so easily, then naturally, I could do the same.  
  
At 3 AM, I stumbled home reeking of alcohol.  
  
Rhys sat in the living room with dark circles under his eyes, his suit wrinkled like pickled vegetables, his tie askew.  
  
Honestly, his disheveled state‚Äîa first in our five-year marriage.  
  
Seeing me return, he exhaled deeply, the corner of his mouth twitching upward:  
  
""You're back. Realized you can't live without me and our son after all, huh? I thought you'd actually have the guts to leave for good. Since you obviously can't survive without us, how about you start behaving yourself?!""  
  
Without answering, I walked straight over and sat down beside him, letting out a drunken hiccup.  
  
His brow furrowed instantly.  
  
""Viv, you went out drinking in the middle of the night? With who?""  
  
I suddenly remembered all those times he'd come home late from ""business dinners,"" stinking of alcohol. Whenever I'd ask questions, he'd snap impatiently: ""It was work. Can you stop interrogating me every single time?""  
  
Now the tables had turned‚Äîhe was the one demanding answers.  
  
Our son, awakened by the argument, padded out barefoot.  
  
Smelling the alcohol, he wrinkled his nose and retreated to Rhys's side.  
  
""Mommy, you stink! Auntie Mel is nothing like you‚Äîshe always smells nice, like a fairy!""  
  
""And she often bakes cakes and makes ice cream for me. All you do is get angry and make me do homework. You never let me eat anything fun. You always look ugly, and now you smell bad too!""  
  
I gazed at my son‚Äîmy son whom I carried for ten months, my son for whom I'd endured over three thousand sleepless nights of feeding during these five years‚Äîmy eyes exhausted and numb.  
  
I don't let him eat ice cream because it upsets his stomach, easily causing diarrhea, which then leads to fever.  
  
For five years I've cared for him day and night, but he can't see my hard work‚Äîyet after meeting Melody just a few brief times, she's all he talks about.  
  
Suddenly, Rhys flicked on the ceiling light. His eyes gleamed with approval of our son.  
  
""Listen to what our son is saying. Are you even acting like a mother anymore?""  
  
""This endless drama over Melody‚Äîdon't you think you're blowing everything out of proportion? I've told you repeatedly, there's nothing between Melody and me. Why can't you get that through your head?""  
  
""Look, salary determines who has a voice in this house. You work at that design firm making next to nothing. Since I'm the one supporting you, get this straight: you're the one who can't survive without us.""  
  
I didn't want to hear another round of their judgment. So I stood to retreat to the bedroom.  
  
""Whatever you say is right,"" I muttered.  
  
Hearing this, Rhys took a deep breath, his voice rough:  
  
""Viv, why do you always act half-dead during our arguments? Do you even care about how I feel?""  
  
I ignored him, but in the next second, dizzy from drinking too much, I lost my balance, sharply banging my shin against the coffee table as I fell backward.  
  
At the same time, Rhys practically dove forward, his palm cushioning my head before it hit the floor.  
  
""Viv! Damn it, be careful!""  
  
I pressed against his chest to sit up, my eyes completely detached.  
  
""Don't touch me.""  
  
He looked utterly shocked upon this, clearly not expecting my coldness. Finally, he let me go.  
  
Without looking back, I retreated to our bedroom and passed out.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
When I woke up again, it was 5 AM.  
  
Despite my hangover from the previous night, my internal clock still woke me up right on schedule.  
  
Over all those years, for every breakfast, Rhys would drink freshly ground hand-drip coffee, while our son only ate freshly made bacon sandwiches paired with fresh milk delivered that same day.  
  
The father and son had impossibly delicate tastes‚Äîcomplaining that the nanny‚Äôs cooking ""had a fridge smell"" and dismissing outdoor breakfasts as ""unhealthy.""  
  
So every morning, I'd get up two hours early just to ensure they could enjoy something fresh and healthy by 7 AM, but today, I forced myself to roll over and go back to sleep.  
  
Some time later, a series of knocks jolted me awake, and I opened the door with disheveled hair to find my son, Noah, standing there.  
  
""Stinky mommy! Bad mommy! Why aren't you up making breakfast for me and daddy? I'm starving!""  
  
I yawned and replied casually, ""I'm taking the day off.""  
  
""No way!"" He suddenly lunged forward, pounding his little fists against my nightgown. ""Auntie Mel says good mommies make food even when they're sick!""  
  
""Well, I'm not your good mommy. Ask the housekeeper if you're hungry.""  
  
Hearing my refusal again, Noah suddenly transformed into an enraged little beast, plopping down on the floor and bursting into tears.  
  
""The housekeeper's food is disgusting! Daddy, mommy won't cook for me! Call Auntie Mel to come over‚Äîher breakfast is amazing, and she actually WANTS to cook for me!""  
  
Rhys poked his head out from downstairs, dark circles under his eyes suggesting he hadn't slept all night.  
  
""Viv, don't take your anger out on the child.""  
  
""If you're tired and don't want to cook, I can call Melody over.""  
  
I said nothing, just walked straight into the bathroom where I thoroughly washed up and applied makeup before putting on my suit, ready to leave.  
  
Before I could get downstairs, I heard Rhys talking to Melody on the phone.  
  
As I passed by him, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.  
  
""Going out? There's hangover soup I made for you on the table. Drink it before you leave.""  
  
I yanked my hand away from his. ""No need, thanks.""  
  
With that, I grabbed my car keys and headed out.  
  
The moment the door closed behind me, I thought I heard the sound of a glass shattering against the wall.  
  
Rhys was furious.  
  
My steps faltered momentarily, but I didn't turn back‚ÄîI kept walking straight to the design firm.  
  
Years ago, when I followed Rhys to this city, I had big dreams, but after his casual ""it's better to have stability after marriage"" comment, I gave up an invitation to study abroad and abandoned my aspirations.  
  
After having our child, I became trapped in domesticity where everything related to family came at the expense of my work hours and rest time, yet my sacrifices went unrecognized. Instead, my husband and our son dismissed me day after day until finally, they chose another woman to trample on my dignity.  
  
Taking a deep breath, I entered the director's office and submitted my resignation, to which the director looked shocked yet somehow unsurprised, nodding and saying, ""You were always meant to spread your wings. Have you decided where you're going? And when?""  
  
I fingered the acceptance letter in my bag‚Äîan offer from Cambridge University's School of Architecture‚Äîand replied, ""England. The day after tomorrow.""  
  
While packing up my desk, my colleague Jen sidled over and asked, ""Viv, I heard you're headed to England. What about Mr. Perfect and Noah?""  
  
I flipped face-down the family photo on my desk, burying the image of the three of us hugging into darkness as I answered, ""We're getting divorced. They'll have a new wife and mother.""  
  
Jen seemed about to say something but ultimately remained silent.  
  
By the time I left the design firm, night had fallen.  
  
When I arrived home and the motion sensor lights flickered on, I spotted suitcases in the living room where Rhys was stuffing Noah's jacket inside while our son stood nearby, clutching his new dinosaur backpack with anticipation.  
  
Near the door, a gift box emblazoned with Herm√®s logo sat brazenly in the entryway‚Äîthe exact designer bag Melody had posted about wanting on social media.  
  
Hearing me enter, Rhys didn't even bother to look up as he stated, ""Last-minute business trip. Taking Noah with me.""  
  
Suddenly his phone rang, and he answered immediately, with Melody's laughter leaking through the speaker, making him narrow his eyes like a contented cat‚Äîan expression I knew all too well, exactly how he looked when he pursued me five years ago.  
  
Noticing me watching, he instantly wiped the smile off his face, ended the call, and challenged, ""Since you clearly don't want to take care of Noah lately, I'm taking him with me. You don't have a problem with that, do you?""  
  
I remained silent without arguments or protests as he efficiently tied his shoelaces, took our son, and left.  
  
The door slammed shut so forcefully that our wedding photo fell from the wall, the shattering of the glass frame making a crisp, almost pleasant sound.  
  
I crouched down, picking up the fragments piece by piece, suddenly feeling incredibly light.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a burl wood coffee table requires careful consideration of several features. From the type of wood and finish to the size and shape, each aspect contributes to the table's overall aesthetic and functionality.

**Wood Type & Origin**

Burl wood is a unique growth found on trees,characterized by it's irregular grain patterns and swirling textures. The type of tree from which the burl originates substantially influences the wood's color, density, and overall appearance. Popular burl wood types include redwood, walnut, maple, and oak. The origin of the wood impacts sustainability and the rarity of the burl, with some regions offering more uniquely patterned burls than others.For instance, california redwood burl is known for its reddish hues and intricate patterns, while walnut burl often displays rich browns and darker accents. Selecting a table made from sustainably harvested burl wood is crucial for environmentally conscious consumers.

**Size & Dimensions**

The dimensions of the coffee table are essential for ensuring it fits seamlessly into your living space. Consider the size of your room and the surrounding furniture when determining the appropriate dimensions. A coffee table should ideally be about two-thirds the length of your sofa and positioned approximately 18 inches away from it. The height of the table should also be considered, usually matching the height of your sofa cushions for pleasant access. Larger rooms can accommodate larger,more ample tables,while smaller spaces may require more compact and space-saving designs. Specific measurements, such as length, width, and height, should be carefully compared to your available space to prevent overcrowding or a disproportionate look.

**Shape & Design**

Burl wood coffee tables come in various shapes and designs, each offering a different aesthetic appeal. Common shapes include rectangular, oval, round, and freeform or organic shapes that follow the natural contours of the wood. The design can range from minimalist and modern to rustic and traditional, depending on the base and finish.A sleek metal base paired with a polished burl wood top creates a contemporary look, while a solid wood base with a raw, unpolished burl top evokes a more rustic feel. The shape and design should complement the existing decor and reflect your personal style preferences.

**Finish & Treatment**

The finish applied to the burl wood significantly affects its appearance and durability. Different finishes can enhance the wood's natural grain,protect it from moisture and scratches,and alter its color. Popular finishes include oil-based finishes, which penetrate the wood and provide a natural, matte look; lacquer finishes, which create a hard, glossy surface; and polyurethane finishes, which offer excellent protection against wear and tear. The treatment of the wood, such as kiln-drying, is also crucial for preventing warping and cracking over time. A well-finished and treated burl wood coffee table will maintain its beauty and integrity for years to come.

**Base Material & Construction**

the table's base is just as important as the burl wood top, contributing to the table's stability, style, and overall durability. Common base materials include metal,wood,and acrylic.Metal bases, such as steel or iron, offer a modern, industrial look and provide excellent support. Wooden bases can be crafted from solid wood or engineered wood, offering a more traditional and cohesive aesthetic. Acrylic bases provide a obvious, minimalist look that allows the burl wood to take center stage. The construction of the base should be sturdy and well-crafted to ensure the table's stability and longevity.

**Sustainability & sourcing**

Ethical sourcing and sustainability are increasingly important considerations for consumers.Look for burl wood coffee tables made from responsibly harvested wood, sourced from well-managed forests or salvaged from naturally fallen trees. Certifications such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) ensure that the wood has been harvested in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. Choosing a table made from sustainable materials not only reduces your environmental impact but also supports responsible forestry practices.

Chapter 1  
  
All of Manhattan knew about the PECULIAR TRADITION in the Forrester family, New York's wealthiest dynasty‚ÄîEvery new bride had to spend her wedding night alone in the family chapel, praying until dawn. Only those who emerged unharmed the next morning were considered blessed by the Forrester ancestors.  
  
What once had been just a formality turned into a nightmare when Callum Forrester, the current heir, took a bride.  
  
His bride was found dead in the chapel, her throat slashed with a gruesome wound, her limbs grotesquely twisted.  
  
Every security camera was reviewed, but the footage clearly showed no one had entered the chapel that night except the bride herself.  
  
Later, Callum married seven more times over the years, and horrifyingly, each bride met the same fate on her wedding night in that chapel.  
  
Police investigations yielded nothing conclusive, and each death was eventually ruled a suicide.  
  
Rumors spread throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome claimed the Forrester estate was haunted, others whispered about dark rituals. No family would risk sending their daughter there anymore.  
  
But today, I stood before Mrs. Forrester in a crimson dress, my posture graceful yet determined.  
  
""Mr. Forrester is exceptionally handsome,"" I said. ""I've admired him from afar for years. I'm willing to be his ninth wife.""  
  
I looked her directly in the eyes. ""Don't worry. Your ancestors may not have liked the others, but they'll certainly like me.""  
  
\---  
  
My family ran a small bakery on York Avenue.  
  
Before dawn each morning, my sister would help our parents with the work‚Äîkneading dough, preparing fillings, making pastries, brewing coffee. She excelled at everything and never let me help.  
  
""Melody, you're meant for academics,"" she would say. ""Just focus on your studies.""  
  
""We'll support you all the way to success!""  
  
Eight years ago, on the day I was announced as Manhattan's valedictorian.  
  
My sister, dressed in a pristine white gown, shyly boarded the luxurious wedding car sent by the Forrester family.  
  
Everyone envied her good fortune. While serving coffee one morning, she had somehow caught the eye of Callum Forrester, heir to the family fortune, and was now marrying into wealth and privilege.  
  
I was happy for her too, not because of the Forrester fortune, but because of the shy, joyful look on her face before she left:  
  
""Melody, don't worry about me. Callum is truly kind, and his family has been welcoming,"" she said, holding my hands. ""I need to fly higher so you can go further. You'll always be the sister I'll protect with everything I have!""  
  
That night, I dreamed my sister had a beautiful baby who called me ""Auntie"" in the sweetest voice while clutching my shirt.  
  
But the next morning, the shocking news of my sister's death shattered our world.  
  
I raced to the Forrester estate, arriving just as they carried her out on a crude stretcher.  
  
My sister's once delicate hands were now bruised and gray. Her fingertips were bloody, all ten nails forcibly torn off, the flesh raw and mangled.  
  
Despite everyone's attempts to stop me, I yanked back the sheet covering her.  
  
Her death was horrifying‚Äîa gaping wound across her throat, her body twisted unnaturally, her eyes bulging like a fish's.  
  
Her pristine white gown was soaked through with blood, a pool of it staining the stretcher beneath her.  
  
I felt the world spinning as I collapsed to the ground.  
  
But then I heard my father's sickeningly servile tone as he kowtowed to Callum.  
  
""This terrible incident must be Victoria's fault‚Äîshe simply wasn't worthy of the Forrester ancestors' blessing.""  
  
""Mr. Forrester, you're young and successful. You'll definitely find a much better wife in the future. Please don't waste your grief on someone so worthless!""  
  
Though we weren't wealthy, my father had always been kind to us sisters, never speaking harshly to either of us.  
  
When relatives once mocked him for having ""worthless daughters,"" he had grabbed a kitchen knife and confronted them.  
  
Now I couldn't believe these words were coming from his mouth.  
  
""Who would've thought I'd marry a mental case? Killing herself in the chapel on our wedding day‚Äîwhat terrible luck!""  
  
""Get rid of her quickly. The sight is giving me a headache.""  
  
Callum's face was dark with annoyance, showing no grief or pain as he turned to leave.  
  
My sister treasured life above all else and had promised to protect me forever‚Äîhow could she possibly have committed suicide?!  
  
Red-eyed, I moved to confront them, only to be struck hard across the face by my father.  
  
""It's your sister's fault for not being fortunate enough to marry into such a good family!""  
  
""Stop embarrassing yourself and come home with me now!""  
  
I saw stars from the impact as my father dragged me away amid the whispers and stares of onlookers.  
  
The incident caused an uproar throughout Manhattan, prompting a special investigation team from the state.  
  
Shockingly, the conclusion matched Callum's claim‚Äîmy sister had committed suicide.  
  
The Forrester estate had stringent security, and all surveillance footage was perfectly preserved. The recordings clearly showed that after my sister entered the chapel, no one else went in. The audio recordings captured even the sound of mosquitoes flying but recorded no screams.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Outside the chapel doors and windows, everything remained peaceful until the next morning when Callum and his mother opened the door and discovered my sister's body.  
  
The medical examiner carefully checked every suspicious detail and ruled out homicide.  
  
Everyone calmly accepted this conclusion‚Äîeveryone except me.  
  
After spending the summer break crying, I enrolled at Princeton University as planned.  
  
Not because I cared about my future, but because it had been my sister's greatest wish for me.  
  
I abandoned the popular finance major and instead chose the obscure field of criminal investigation.  
  
After completing my undergraduate studies, I continued with a combined master's and doctoral program. I studied harder than anyone, terrified of missing any knowledge that might help me solve the mystery of my sister's death.  
  
Eight years later, I returned to Manhattan again.  
  
Much had happened with the Forrester family during my absence. After my sister, Callum had married seven more wives.  
  
These seven women came from vastly different backgrounds, with varied appearances and personalities.  
  
Yet each bride had died by apparent suicide in the family chapel on her wedding night.  
  
Particularly noteworthy was the eighth wife, married just six months ago‚ÄîDarla Thompson, a butcher's daughter from the marketplace. She weighed nearly 300 pounds and was strong enough to knock out a grown man with one punch, with a notoriously volatile temper.  
  
Her father had gambling debts of $500,000, and the Forresters, desperate for a bride, had promised her $20 million in cash and ten commercial properties in Marina City if she survived the night.  
  
Darla tried‚Äîbut didn't make it out alive.  
  
Callum had attempted to persuade his family to abandon the chapel ritual, but Mrs. Forrester insisted it was a tradition passed down through generations that could not be broken.  
  
This led to rumors spreading throughout Manhattan‚Äîsome said the Forrester estate was haunted by malevolent spirits determined to end the family line; others whispered that the Forresters were sacrificing brides to feed otherworldly beings in exchange for their incredible wealth.  
  
Whatever the truth, no family across the country was willing to send their daughter there anymore.  
  
Yet on my second day back in Manhattan, I dressed in a striking crimson dress, applied flawless makeup, and appeared at the Forrester estate's entrance.  
  
""Tell your mistress I'm willing to be Callum Forrester's ninth wife.""  
  
News of my request to marry Callum spread through Manhattan like wildfire.  
  
Though Manhattan wasn't small, gossip traveled faster than any virus.  
  
""I heard Melody Vincent just returned yesterday and is already offering to marry Callum Forrester. Both sisters are just gold-diggers!""  
  
""Poor Mr. Vincent‚Äîhe used to brag about how brilliant his daughter was, but look at her now, falling at the feet of money just like her sister.""  
  
""Money aside, those Forrester rumors should give anyone pause. Looks like the Vincent family might lose both daughters to that cursed place!""  
  
Everyone in Manhattan branded me as a shallow gold-digger.  
  
The fact that I was a Princeton graduate with a doctorate made the contrast all the more shocking and thrilling to them.  
  
Inside the Forrester estate, Mrs. Forrester had me brought to her.  
  
""Melody Vincent, do you truly want to marry my son?"" she asked, studying me with interest.  
  
""More certain than gold is pure!"" I replied with a smile.  
  
""Everyone knows Mr. Forrester is refined, gentle, and friendly‚Äînot to mention his net worth recently surpassed ten billion. What reason could I possibly have not to like him?""  
  
Mrs. Forrester responded with a cold laugh.  
  
""I knew you couldn't genuinely care for Callum!""  
  
The disgust in her eyes was unmistakable.  
  
But I knew she had no choice.  
  
""Look, I'm not gonna beat around the bush,"" she said.  
  
""You haven't forgotten what happened to your sister in our family chapel eight years ago, have you?""  
  
""During the eight years you've been away, a new bride has died in that chapel each year. What makes you think you'll live longer than they did?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Mrs. Forrester's piercing gaze fixed on me.  
  
I smiled faintly.  
  
""Don't worry, Mrs. Forrester. I'm different from those ordinary women. Your ancestors may not have liked them, but they'll certainly approve of me!""  
  
I stared back at her with proud confidence.  
  
She studied me for a long time before finally nodding in agreement.  
  
""Go prepare yourself. Only by surviving tonight can you prove you're different from the others!""  
  
She dismissed me with a wave.  
  
I smiled, knowing all truths would be revealed tonight!  
  
When I returned home, my parents were already waiting.  
  
""What madness is this? Who gave you permission to agree to marry Callum Forrester?!"" My father's face was flushed with anger.  
  
My mother anxiously wiped away tears, her eyes filled with sorrow as she looked at me.  
  
But as I faced my father, I felt nothing.  
  
""Since when have you cared who I marry?"" I asked, staring into his eyes.  
  
""What nonsense! Why wouldn't I care? Don't you know about the Forrester rumors? Going there is practically suicide! Are you trying to put me and your mother in an early grave?""  
  
My father desperately tried to make me see reason.  
  
But I only coldly asked: ""If you truly cared, you wouldn't have let Victoria die in vain back then.""  
  
My father's entire body trembled, his lips quivering.  
  
""Melody, don't speak to your father like that. Your father‚Ä¶"" my mother began.  
  
""Shut up!"" he snapped harshly when my mother tried to defend him.  
  
Then he glared at me intensely.  
  
""Fine, since you've made your decision, I won't interfere anymore.""  
  
""From this day forward, you are no longer my daughter!""  
  
My father drove me from the house despite my mother's desperate pleas, but he remained unmoved.  
  
After leaving, I bowed deeply toward my parents' home.  
  
""Dad, Mom, your daughter has been unfilial.""  
  
""If I can uncover the truth, I promise I'll return to care for you properly!""  
  
I whispered before turning toward the end of the alley.  
  
Callum's wedding procession was even more extravagant than eight years ago‚Äîa line of Rolls-Royces that anyone would envy.  
  
""Well, that's it for the Vincent family line!""  
  
""All those years of fancy education, and that Princeton doctorate isn't worth squat, is it?""  
  
The neighbors lining the alley had all come out to mock me with their cruel taunts.  
  
Yet I boarded the car without hesitation.  
  
The procession moved slowly, taking half an hour to reach the vicinity of the Forrester family chapel.  
  
But when we were still about five hundred yards from the chapel, the driver refused to go any further.  
  
""Miss Vincent, may God be with you. We wouldn't go near that place even if you killed us,"" the driver said, turning to me.  
  
I nodded slightly, then got out and looked ahead.  
  
Perhaps it was the poor weather, or perhaps the area truly was heavy with malevolent energy, but the summer night suddenly felt bone-chillingly cold.  
  
The dark alley ahead resembled a path to hell, yet I walked forward with determined steps.  
  
A few minutes later, I stood before the Forrester family chapel.  
  
The door creaked open, and Mrs. Forrester stood in the entrance beckoning to me.  
  
Perhaps it was her overly pale makeup, but I couldn't shake the impression she resembled a paper effigy.  
  
Mrs. Forrester thrust a prayer book into my hands.  
  
""Go. Recite the prayers,"" she instructed coldly.  
  
""Read them through once, then again. I advise you not to fall asleep‚Äîotherwise... well, who knows what might happen.""  
  
Her eyes held a strange mixture of contempt and pity as she looked at me.  
  
Beside her, Callum emerged from the chapel with several others.  
  
He glanced at me dismissively.  
  
""Your sister was much prettier than you, but it doesn't matter now. I'd marry a pig if it survived the night!""  
  
Callum's face was filled with arrogance.  
  
I silently clenched my fists.  
  
I remained convinced that Callum had done something to my sister!  
  
Now my enemy stood before me, yet I could do nothing‚Äîthe frustration was unbearable.  
  
""May I enter now?"" I asked, looking at Mrs. Forrester.  
  
She didn't speak, merely gesturing for someone to open the inner doors of the chapel.  
  
I walked step by step toward the unknown abyss, my heart growing heavier with each step.  
  
The door slowly closed behind me.  
  
As the last sliver of light disappeared, I found myself in complete darkness.  
  
Whoosh!  
  
Suddenly, candles on the walls ignited, their flickering light making everything around me seem eerily distorted.  
  
My heart raced involuntarily, especially when I first glimpsed the portraits of Forrester ancestors on the walls‚Äîmy fear reached its peak.  
  
Ahead, memorial tablets were arranged neatly, with a prayer mat placed on the floor.  
  
I took a deep breath, gathering my courage to approach, kneeling on the mat.  
  
Then I opened the prayer book, trying to calm myself.  
  
But just as I prepared to begin reciting, something suddenly occurred to me.  
  
""Let me out! Let me out right now!""  
  
""I know what's happening!""  
  
""I know why all those brides died mysteriously!""",1,1750834080.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

1. Crab Tomato Cream Spaghetti with Ricotta Cheese from 4Ps- my sister said it was a requirement for our trip; I realized why when I ate this pasta -- so rich and creamy!   
2. Banh Xeo from a random stall at The New Playground - wasn't expecting much since this is in a shopping complex but wow was I ever so wrong! Flavorful and perfectly crispy, it hit the spot after an afternoon of shopping  
3. Egg Coffee and breakfast from Little Hanoi - I tried a loooot of coffee on this trip but this one really hit the spot paired with our egg meals  
4. Can't remember the exact names of the dishes but this is the spread from Man Moi - this place was a bit fancier, but it was highly recommended if we wanted to eat authentic vietnamese cuisine. 10/10 would go back, but do let me know if there are other options we can try with the same vibe!",8,1750833994.0,VietNam,5,1.0,False

Chapter 1  
  
I kicked my ex in the balls and jumpstarted my fortune with the breakup cash his mom and his new girl threw at me.  
  
Being a rich bitch feels amazing.  
  
But that damn ex? Like a cockroach that just won't die.  
  
So I did what any self-respecting future billionaire would‚ÄîI got myself a hot college boy on payroll.  
  
Now my ex is sobbing like a soap opera:  
  
""You promised me forever, remember? You said we'd be soulmates!""  
  
I held my baby boy's hand and shrugged,  
  
""Yeah. Sounds like a Hallmark card to me.""  
  
\---  
  
Took me three sentences to squeeze two million bucks out of two different women.  
  
Not bad for a broke trust fund kid.  
  
Back when my family still had money, everyone said Declan and I were made for each other.  
  
Golden couple. High school sweethearts. Meant to be.  
  
What a joke.  
  
That only worked when my last name still meant something.  
  
Now that our family business tanked, all those people suddenly decided I was ""not on Declan's level anymore.""  
  
Today, his mom invited me for lunch.  
  
She showed up with pearls, Botox, and enough entitlement to fill the country club.  
  
She opened her Prada bag and pulled out a check.  
  
""Five hundred grand,"" she said.  
  
""Walk away from Declan. End the engagement.""  
  
I stared at that half-a-mil like it was the Mona Lisa.  
  
Teary-eyed. Heartbroken. Oscar-worthy.  
  
""Mrs. Whitmore,"" I said, voice trembling.  
  
""I love Declan. How could you insult my feelings with just five hundred thousand dollars?""  
  
I deserved an Emmy.  
  
Truth is, I didn't hear anything after she said ""five hundred grand.""  
  
She gave me this tight smile and leaned in.  
  
""Sweetheart, men come and go. But money in the bank?""  
  
""That's forever. And let's be real‚Äîyour family could really use it.""  
  
Translation: You're broke, honey. Take the money and disappear.  
  
I'm not stupid.  
  
But five hundred K? What am I, a charity case?  
  
I sighed, dabbing the corner of my eye.  
  
""Since we've known each other so long‚Ä¶ Make it a million.""  
  
""Think of the extra half as a donation to your precious Whitmore legacy.""  
  
She didn't even flinch.  
  
Just nodded like she wanted the mess gone quickly and quietly.  
  
And there it was.  
  
Two checks. Sitting pretty on the table like twin angels sent by the IRS.  
  
""I'm sorry you don't believe in my love for Declan,"" I whispered.  
  
""So I'll step aside.""  
  
She left without another word.  
  
The second that door clicked shut, I snatched the checks off the table and wiped away my fake tears.  
  
""Bingo,"" I whispered. ""Thank you, universe.""  
  
One million dollars for dumping a guy I didn't even want anymore?  
  
Blessed. Truly blessed.  
  
While I was still admiring my new fortune, the door opened again.  
  
Enter: Barbie.  
  
She was sweet-faced, fake-nailed, and so desperate for Declan it was embarrassing.  
  
Everyone knew she'd been orbiting him for years. Never crossed the line though‚Äî‚Äòcause I was in the way.  
  
Now? With the engagement off? Girl came ready to pounce.  
  
She didn't even sit down before snapping,  
  
""Name your price. Just stay away from Declan.""  
  
I almost laughed out loud.  
  
Another sugar angel sent straight to my Venmo.  
  
Honestly, who fights over a guy who flirts with everyone but commits to no one? If it weren't for our parents' pre-nup agreement, I wouldn't have touched him with a ten-foot pole.  
  
I tilted my head, sipped my coffee, and smiled.  
  
""Two million,"" I said. ""Pay up, and he's all yours.""  
  
She gasped like I'd just slapped her mother.  
  
""Are you insane?! That's extortion!""  
  
""Wait, are you saying your love's not worth two million?"" I said sweetly. ""Yikes.""  
  
Her face turned red‚Äîrage or shame, I couldn't tell.  
  
She whipped out her checkbook and scribbled zero after zero like she was signing a deal with the devil.  
  
Then slammed it on the table.  
  
""You really think Declan's family will ever accept you? Your whole family's going down in flames.""  
  
I took the check, kissed it like a prom queen, and smiled.  
  
""Thanks for your concern, hon. Now run along and enjoy your man.""  
  
She grabbed her bag and stormed off with one last threat:  
  
""You better hold up your end. Or I'll make sure you regret it.""  
  
The second she was gone, I FaceTimed my bestie.  
  
""Girl. You are not gonna believe the day I've had.""  
  
""I just made two million playing breakup broker. I think I found my calling.""  
  
""Do you think the universe can send me, like, five more sugar donors?""  
  
I stared at my brand-new checks like they were lottery tickets.  
  
Sure, two million might be pocket change to billionaires, but to my family?  
  
It's the damn lifeline we've been praying for.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I met up with my bestie, the one who's been my ride-or-die since we were in diapers.  
  
Her family's filthy rich, total old money vibes.  
  
When my family tanked and the rest of my so-called friends ghosted me, she stuck around like nothing changed.  
  
""No way. You're telling me someone actually fell for that?""  
  
She looked at me like I just told her I robbed a bank.  
  
""You played her like that? Aren't you scared she'll come after you?""  
  
""Amanda, c'mon. I didn't ‚Äòplay' anyone,"" I shrugged.  
  
""I just‚Ä¶ left Declan. That's all.""  
  
I sipped my coffee, chill as hell.  
  
""I just moved faster than the gossip mill.""  
  
""If she'd waited two more hours, she'd have heard I dumped his ass from someone else anyway.""  
  
It wasn't manipulation. It was strategy.  
  
""But hey, if she really does come for me, promise you'll bail me out?""  
  
I grabbed Amanda's arm, pretending to cry into her shoulder.  
  
""I'm just a poor little heiress trying to survive, help me, sugar mama!""  
  
She rolled her eyes.  
  
""Oh please. I got your back, obviously.""  
  
""So... what did Declan say about the breakup?""  
  
I snorted.  
  
""What do you think? Dude probably popped a bottle the second I was out the door.""  
  
""Less drama for him, more space for his ego.""  
  
""He threw a party? Then you throw one too! You can't let him win!""  
  
""Amanda, babe, my family's broke. Like, borderline foreclosure.""  
  
""You want me to throw a party for that?""  
  
She waved me off.  
  
""It's not totally over yet.  
  
I heard your dad's trying to land a deal with Veridian Tech. Worst case? I'll cover the party.""  
  
I'd heard whispers of that too, but come on.  
  
Veridian's massive. That deal's a long shot.  
  
Still, I didn't throw a party‚Äîbut somehow, I ended up at a bar that night anyway.  
  
Thanks to Amanda dragging me out.  
  
And guess who I ran into?  
  
Yep. Declan.  
  
I was sipping tequila at the bar when I saw his smug ass walk in.  
  
Instant migraine.  
  
I got up to leave‚Äîlast thing I wanted was a run-in‚Äîbut of course, he had to open his damn mouth.  
  
""Elara Vaughn?""  
  
Oh God, here we go.  
  
""What are you doing here?""  
  
I didn't even look at him.  
  
""Pretty sure your mom told you‚Äîwe're done.""  
  
Declan looked like he had somewhere else to be. Preferably anywhere I wasn't.  
  
God, he was always so painfully average‚Ä¶ and yet somehow so smug.  
  
""I didn't come looking for you,"" I said flatly.  
  
""You walked up to me, remember? I haven't moved an inch.""  
  
He crossed his arms.  
  
""This place isn't safe for a girl like you. Go home.""  
  
""Excuse me? If you can be here, I can be here. I'm waiting for someone, actually.""  
  
""Who?""  
  
He didn't buy it for a second.  
  
""A hot college boy.""  
  
His jaw twitched.  
  
Broke or not, I still had taste. And standards.  
  
And apparently, enough cash to entertain the idea of a boy toy.  
  
""Speak of the devil,"" I said as I spotted a very pretty boy walk in. ""There he is.""  
  
And just like that, I strutted off.  
  
""Hey, baby,"" I said sweetly, leaning on the bar next to him. ""Wanna grab a drink?""  
  
He smiled like he'd been waiting for that all night. ""Sure thing. My treat?""  
  
He ordered us both drinks, cool as hell, but shot a glance at Declan behind me.  
  
""That guy staring at you‚Ä¶ friend of yours?""  
  
""Nope,"" I said. ""Probably a problem, though.""  
  
""‚Ä¶A problem?"" he blinked. ""Am I about to get punched?""  
  
I grinned. ""Eh, maybe. You scared?""  
  
He laughed, but I could tell he was still unsure.  
  
Then I dropped it.  
  
""You need cash?""  
  
He blinked.  
  
""Yeah‚Ä¶ kinda. Why?""  
  
I smiled.  
  
""I'll be real. What if I‚Ä¶ sponsored you?""  
  
He stared at me like he wasn't sure if I was serious.  
  
I was. Too many shots deep and pissed off at the world.  
  
And honestly? He was way too hot to ignore.  
  
""Sure,"" he said with a lazy grin.  
  
""You offering room and board? Health insurance, maybe?""  
  
I almost choked on my drink. ""Sure. Full package.""  
  
Even I couldn't believe I said that out loud.  
  
He just smiled wider.  
  
God, his smile should be illegal.  
  
And Declan?  
  
He stormed out the second I leaned closer.  
  
Bye-bye, Mr. Ex.  
  
Hello, arm candy.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
The next morning, I woke up sprawled across my giant king-size bed.  
  
Sunlight poured in through the windows.  
  
Birds were chirping. The air smelled weirdly like‚Ä¶ steak?  
  
I blinked.  
  
Steak?  
  
Wait.  
  
Where the hell was I?  
  
Last I remembered, I was at a bar. Now I'm home?  
  
And why does it smell like someone's cooking French steak?  
  
I sat up slowly, dread curling in my stomach.  
  
Maybe Amanda brought me home and made me breakfast?  
  
No way.  
  
Amanda can't cook for shit. She once blew up a toaster trying to make Pop-Tarts.  
  
I grabbed my phone‚Äîalready on speed dial with 911‚Äîand picked up my old baseball bat from under the bed.  
  
Don't ask why it was there.  
  
Then I heard it.  
  
Clattering in the kitchen.  
  
Someone was in my kitchen.  
  
I crept closer, bat raised, ready to swing.  
  
And then I saw it‚Äîa guy.  
  
A tall one, with broad shoulders and a perfect back, cooking like he belonged there.  
  
I gripped the baseball bat, heart pounding, ready to whack the guy if he made a move.  
  
But he must've sensed it‚Äîhe turned around, smiling right at me.  
  
""You're up? Want some steak? Just grilled it.""  
  
""Uh‚Ä¶ who are you, exactly?""  
  
I quickly hid the bat behind me, but obviously, he'd already seen it. Real smooth.  
  
As soon as I got a good look at his face, the memories hit me‚ÄîI actually did bring home a hot college guy last night!  
  
Well, technically he brought me home.  
  
""And what's the bat for?""  
  
""Ahem. Thought I'd, uh... get some cardio in.""  
  
""I'll take a steak, thanks.""  
  
I tossed the bat onto the couch like it was no big deal.  
  
Then plopped down at the table, shamelessly waiting for my steak.  
  
I mean, I already paid for the boy, didn't I? Might as well enjoy the meal.  
  
And damn, kid's got skills‚Äîthis steak was worth every dollar.  
  
It's been two months since I ""sponsored"" my college boytoy.  
  
Thanks to our new partnership with Veridian Tech, my family's financial crisis is finally over.  
  
The $3 million my dad had borrowed from my ex's mom and his wannabe fianc√©e? He gave it all back to me.  
  
I wanted to turn it down, but‚Ä¶ well, with mouths to feed and bills to pay, I took it.  
  
And I handed that $3 million straight to my sweet little puppy.  
  
He looked at me like I was handing him the moon.  
  
Guess he'd never seen that much cash before‚Äîcan't blame him.  
  
Not everyone's lucky enough to have a sugar mama like me.  
  
Now that the family company's bounced back, I'm back in the spotlight as the classic rich-and-beautiful Elara Vaughn.  
  
And thanks to the Veridian Tech collab, my clout's only grown.  
  
Everybody wants to cozy up to me just to get near Veridian.  
  
Joke's on them‚ÄîI don't even know anyone at Veridian Tech.  
  
And just when the suitors started lining up like it's The Bachelor, guess who pops back up?  
  
Declan.  
  
Tonight's a gala hosted by Veridian Tech, and I'm here repping the Vaughn family.  
  
I barely get through the door before Lucian Graves pulls me aside with a plate of food.  
  
Right‚Äîforgot to mention.  
  
Lucian is the college kid I ""sponsored.""  
  
Before I can even get a bite of cake, my phone buzzes with an anonymous text.  
  
""Take my money and stay away from Declan. Don't embarrass yourself.""  
  
Excuse me?  
  
""I didn't take your damn money. Don't spread lies.""  
  
I look up and catch this sweet little blond thing giving me a death glare from across the room.  
  
Takes talent to throw shade from that far away.  
  
That's when I realize what ""money"" she's talking about.  
  
And now that I'm paying attention, a lot of people seem to recognize me.  
  
Soon I'm swarmed‚Äîeveryone wants to talk, network, whatever.  
  
""Elara, may I have the honor of your first dance tonight?""  
  
""Nope.""  
  
Before I can even say no, Lucian shuts it down with a roll of his eyes.  
  
""Might want to wait your turn. As her date, I get the first dance.""  
  
He turns to me, offering his hand.  
  
""May I?""  
  
With his hand already there, it'd be rude to say no‚Ä¶ and honestly, I didn't want to.  
  
Lucian lit up when I said yes, then turned to the poor guy like he just won the lottery.  
  
""Sorry, pal. If you're not needed, you can see yourself out.""  
  
Smug little bastard looked downright adorable doing it.  
  
Of course, the other guy didn't think so‚Äîhe shot Lucian a glare.  
  
""You've got some nerve, punk. Not sure how long you can keep this act up.""  
  
""And you? You're just a damn escort.""  
  
That pissed me off.  
  
Yeah, okay, when we first met, I did joke about ""sponsoring"" him. But all we've done is hold hands.  
  
There's no contract. It's just dating‚Ä¶ with flair.  
  
We're basically a couple.  
  
We just happen to have met under slightly... unconventional terms.  
  
And who the hell gave this loser the right to judge?  
  
I yanked Lucian behind me and let the guy have it.  
  
""Is that how your mom taught you to talk to women?""  
  
""Get rejected and suddenly it's open season on character assassination?""  
  
""For your information, we're in a serious relationship.""  
  
I could hear Lucian chuckling behind me.  
  
Laughing? Seriously? The guy just called you a hooker and you're giggling?  
  
Now I'm starting to wonder‚Ä¶ who even started this ""sugar mama"" rumor?  
  
Because I sure as hell didn't tell anyone.  
  
Wait.  
  
Oh my god. That dumbass Declan better not have actually believed that crap.  
  
""Who told you we were in a sugar arrangement? Declan?""  
  
""No one had to tell me. If you're doing it, don't act all shy when people call it out.""  
  
But the guy looked away when he said it. Bingo.  
  
Now I remember where I've seen him‚Äîhe's one of Declan's little cronies.  
  
Figures. Typical insecure man‚Äîcan't win, so he lies.  
  
But before things could get messier, a rep from Veridian Tech arrived.  
  
""Elara Vaughn?""  
  
It was Nathaniel, their Director of Strategy‚Äîgreeting me personally.  
  
In full formal tone, no less.  
  
This kind of recognition doesn't come cheap.  
  
I kept it classy.  
  
""Director Nathaniel, it's a pleasure.""  
  
""And who's this gentleman with you?""  
  
""This is my boyfriend, Lucian.""  
  
I said it loud and proud.  
  
Everyone nearby turned their heads. That line got attention.

This space is warm and grounding. The rattan furniture, soft green walls, and neutral tones give it a calm, earthy energy. I added little touches like folded clothes, a hanging plant, and a small writing desk to make it feel real ‚Äî like a space for quiet mornings or rainy afternoons.

üõÅ Bathroom
This room was inspired by serene spa-like interiors. I used hexagonal tiles in a green and white palette, and added bonsai trees, candles, and a deep soaking tub to give it that meditative stillness. It‚Äôs meant to feel like a private little retreat ‚Äî somewhere peaceful to unwind.

Chapter 1  
  
Scarlett Devereaux was renowned in elite circles as the ultimate seductress, with her perfectly curved red lips and those captivating cat-like eyes that could seduce anyone with just a glance.  
  
While Jackson Blackwell was the epitome of the perfect heir of high society‚Äîuntouchable, disciplined, and maddeningly self-controlled.  
  
No one would've guessed that these two polar opposites secretly tangled in heated passion in the back of his Maybach at midnight, desperately devoured each other in charity gala bathrooms, or that he'd grip her waist against his vineyard's floor-to-ceiling windows until her legs gave out beneath her.  
  
After yet another night of abandon, the shower's gentle patter filled the bathroom.  
  
Scarlett lounged against the headboard, dialing her father's number:  
  
""I'll marry that dying Miami heir for the fortune, but I have one condition..."" she said coolly.  
  
Her father's voice crackled with barely contained excitement. ""Name it! Whatever you want. If you're willing to marry him, I'll give you anything!""  
  
""Let's discuss it when I get home."" Her voice was soft, but her eyes remained cold and calculating.  
  
Scarlett hung up and was about to dress when she noticed Jackson's laptop sitting nearby.  
  
The Instagram was open, showing a message from someone labeled ""Lily.""  
  
\[Jackson, there's a thunderstorm. I'm so scared...\]  
  
Scarlett's fingers trembled slightly.  
  
Just then, the bathroom door suddenly swung open as Jackson emerged, water droplets trailing down his collarbone. His shirt hung open at the top, two buttons undone, lending his typically austere appearance a hint of sensuality.  
  
""Something came up at the office. I need to go,"" he said, reaching for his jacket, his voice maintaining its usual coolness.  
  
Scarlett curved her lips into a smile. ""Off to the office, or running to your precious soulmate?""  
  
Jackson looked confused. ""What?""  
  
""Nothing,"" she replied, sliding barefoot from the bed, her pale feet sinking into the plush carpet.  
  
His eyes darkened as he caught her chin between his thumb and forefinger, tracing her swollen lips. ""Be good. Don't cause trouble.""  
  
As the door closed behind him, Scarlett's smile vanished instantly.  
  
She called a car and followed him.  
  
Half an hour later, the car stopped outside a hotel. Through the rain-streaked window, Scarlett watched as Lily Bennett, dressed in a flowing white dress, ran out from the hotel entrance.  
  
Jackson strode forward, removing his suit jacket and draping it over her shoulders before sweeping her into his arms.  
  
""It's freezing out here. How could you come outside without a coat, hmm?"" he chided gently.  
  
His movements were so practiced, so natural, as if he'd done this a thousand times before.  
  
Scarlett clutched the door handle until her nails dug painfully into her palm.  
  
As she watched Jackson carefully carrying Lily into the hotel, she suddenly recalled the first time they'd met.  
  
Back then, she'd been fighting bitterly with her father, had actually cracked his skull open during one particularly vicious argument. He'd shipped her off to his best friend's son for ""discipline,"" claiming his rebellious princess needed her sharp edges smoothed out.  
  
When they first met, Jackson was sitting in his penthouse office at Blackwell Industries, his gaze icy cold behind those gold-rimmed glasses.  
  
She was determined not to stay.  
  
So she constantly made trouble.  
  
On her first day, she spilled coffee all over his custom Italian suit worth hundreds of thousands. Yet Jackson merely gave her a passing glance: ""Italian cashmere, air-shipped yesterday. Put it on the Devereaux account.""  
  
On the second day, she deliberately threw important meeting documents into the shredder. Jackson didn't flinch, reciting the entire contents from memory, leaving the executive board stunned into silence.  
  
On the third day, she drugged his coffee and set up cameras, planning to capture embarrassing footage she could use to blackmail him.  
  
Instead, she became his remedy.  
  
When she woke the next morning, her entire body ached. Furious enough to commit murder, Scarlett found herself pinned against the floor-to-ceiling windows for another round.  
  
""Scarlett,"" he whispered against her ear, his voice husky with desire, ""be good.""  
  
Just that simple endearment‚Äî""Scarlett""‚Äîshattered her defenses.  
  
No one had called her that so tenderly since her mother died.  
  
From that day forward, their relationship transformed entirely.  
  
Every time she acted out, Jackson would simply haul her into his office. Everyone assumed he was scolding her, when in reality he was bending her over his desk until her legs gave out.  
  
Gradually, Scarlett realized she'd become addicted.  
  
Was it his expertise? Or was she just that lonely?  
  
She couldn't tell.  
  
All she knew was that she'd fallen. Hard.  
  
So on his birthday, she spent the entire day decorating his villa‚Äîroses, candles, music‚Ä¶ She'd even bought an engagement ring.  
  
But Scarlett waited the entire night, watched the candles burn down and the roses wilt, and still he never showed up.  
  
Until three in the morning, when her phone suddenly pinged with a breaking news alert‚Äî  
  
\#Billionaire CEO Picks Up Childhood Sweetheart at Airport#  
  
The photo showed Jackson carefully helping a girl in a white dress into his car, looking at her with unbearable tenderness.  
  
The comment section exploded:  
  
""OMG! The CEO and his innocent princess! I'm DYING over here!""  
  
""Holy shit! Isn't that Jackson Blackwell and Lily Bennett from Kingston Prep? They were THE couple back in the day!""  
  
""I went to school with them and can confirm! Mr. Blackwell was ice-cold to everyone except Lily! If she hadn't gotten sick and gone abroad for treatment, they'd be married by now for sure!""  
  
Thud!  
  
The phone slipped from her fingers and clattered to the floor.  
  
Scarlett couldn't believe her eyes.  
  
If Jackson already had someone in his heart, what was she? Just a convenient fuck whenever he wanted?  
  
Trembling, she called Jackson's number, desperate for an explanation, but her calls went straight to voicemail.  
  
After the final failed attempt, Scarlett set down her phone and walked into Jackson's study‚Äîa room he'd explicitly forbidden her to enter.  
  
When she pushed the door open, it felt like she'd been struck by lightning.  
  
The room was filled with photos of Lily‚Äîgraduation photos, vacation snapshots, even candid pictures of Lily sleeping.  
  
The always-composed, always-controlled Jackson Blackwell had done something so... obsessive.  
  
Any need for answers evaporated.  
  
Scarlett started laughing, the sound unnaturally harsh in the empty room.  
  
As she laughed, hot tears spilled down her cheeks, dropping onto the hardwood floor.  
  
Red-eyed, she destroyed the entire villa.  
  
When Jackson returned the next day and saw the devastation, he simply called for cleaning staff.  
  
He didn't even spare her a second glance, as if her behavior was precisely what he expected.  
  
Scarlett watched in silence as the maid swept away the engagement ring box with the rest of the debris.  
  
He had no idea what had been inside.  
  
No idea that she had wanted to spend her life with him.  
  
No idea that when that ring hit the bottom of the trash can, she decided she would never love him again.  
  
""Miss, where would you like to go?"" The driver's voice pulled her back to reality.  
  
""Home,"" Scarlett said, opening her eyes, her voice cold. ""Take me back to the Devereaux estate.""  
  
Upon arriving at the Devereaux mansion, her father immediately rushed to greet her. ""Scarlett, you're really willing to marry into Miami?""  
  
From the staircase, her stepmother watched expectantly.  
  
""Yes,"" Scarlett replied, her eyes turning frosty. ""But I mentioned a condition, didn't I?""  
  
""What is it? Name it!""  
  
""I want to‚Ä¶"" Scarlett enunciated each word clearly, ""sever all ties with you as father and daughter.""  
  
The air suddenly felt thick and unbreathable.  
  
Her father's face contorted with rage. ""Have you lost your mind? Do you even know what you're saying?""  
  
""Perfectly clear,"" Scarlett's voice was ice-cold. ""You cheated while married. To make room for this homewrecker,"" she gestured toward her stepmother, ""you drove my mother to jump to her death. From that day on, I stopped considering you my father.""  
  
She stared at her father's ashen face. ""Now Miami's dying heir is offering five hundred million for a bride to bring him luck, and you've been pressuring me for three months. If I didn't agree, were you planning to drug me and drag me there?""  
  
""If that's how it is, what difference does it make if we're legally related or not?"" She smirked cruelly. ""You can bring your mistress's daughter home and make her the Devereaux princess instead.""  
  
Her father trembled with fury. ""Fine! We'll sever ties! But that Miami heir reportedly won't make it to the end of the month. You MUST marry him before then!""  
  
He laughed coldly. ""As for your stepsister, she just returned from abroad a few days ago and has been staying at a hotel. Since you're so willing to step aside, she'll move in tomorrow!""  
  
Scarlett laughed bitterly, her heart aching. ""Rushing to raise another woman's daughter while rejecting your own. You really are one of a kind.""  
  
She turned to leave, but her stepmother, Victoria, blocked her path with fake concern. ""Scarlett, how can you speak to your father this way?""  
  
Scarlett stopped dead.  
  
She slowly turned, her eyes blazing with years of suppressed hatred. ""What's wrong? Feeling like you can finally act the part of the lady of the house now that I'm leaving? Let me make something crystal clear, Victoria Bennett.""  
  
She advanced step by step. ""Even with my mother dead, nothing changes the fact that you're just a homewrecker that everyone despises! Even if your precious daughter becomes the Devereaux princess, she'll never escape the stain of having a mother who's nothing but a cheap mistress!""  
  
Victoria's face turned deathly pale as she stumbled backward.  
  
Scarlett stormed away, each step feeling like walking on broken glass.  
  
Only when she reached her room and closed the door did she slide to the floor as if all her strength had been drained, burying her face deep in her knees.  
  
The next morning, the sounds of moving and laughter woke her.  
  
""What's going on?"" She flung her door open. ""Can't a person get some fucking sleep around here?""  
  
The housekeeper stammered: ""Miss Devereaux... your stepsister has moved in...""  
  
Before he could finish, a familiar figure appeared at the staircase‚Äî  
  
Lily Bennett, wearing a white sundress, stood there looking delicate and vulnerable.  
  
Scarlett's blood instantly turned to ice!  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Scarlett could never have imagined that her stepmother's daughter, who had been ""recovering abroad"" for years, would turn out to be Jackson's precious Lily.  
  
Life had just handed her the cruelest joke imaginable.  
  
A moment later, Lily approached her with a sweet smile. ""Sister, I'm so sorry I disturbed your sleep...""  
  
Before she could finish, Scarlett slammed the door shut with a thunderous bang.  
  
""Scarlett! Where are your manners?!"" Her father roared from outside. ""Clear out your room! If Lily likes it, this will be her bedroom from now on!""  
  
Scarlett laughed bitterly, immediately starting to pack her suitcases.  
  
Outside, she could hear fragments of conversation‚Äî  
  
""Uncle Richard, is Scarlett angry?"" Lily's voice was soft as honey.  
  
""Don't worry about her. She's been spoiled rotten since childhood.""  
  
""But...""  
  
""Don't worry, she'll be married off to Miami soon. After that, this house will belong to you and your mother.""  
  
Scarlett's hand paused momentarily before she smirked even more darkly.  
  
She quickly booked an end-of-month flight to Miami and continued packing.  
  
Half an hour later, she wheeled her luggage out of the room.  
  
In the living room, her father, Victoria, and Lily sat on the sofa watching TV, fruit and pastries arranged on the coffee table, looking every bit the picture-perfect family.  
  
Scarlett walked straight toward the door without a glance in their direction.  
  
""Stop right there!"" her father commanded. ""What are you doing now? Don't forget what you promised!""  
  
""Don't worry, I always keep my word,"" Scarlett replied without turning around. ""But for these next two weeks, I'd rather not stay somewhere that makes me sick to my stomach.""  
  
She checked into the Presidential Suite at The Langham, Boston's most expensive hotel and embarked on a shopping spree of epic proportions.  
  
She bought the most exquisite wedding dress, bid millions at auctions for antique jewelry to serve as her dowry.  
  
Even if she was just a ""lucky charm"" bride, she would arrive in Miami like a queen.  
  
Her phone buzzed relentlessly in her bag. Scarlett only checked it after purchasing her final diamond necklace.  
  
Thirty-eight missed calls, all from her father.  
  
She had barely swiped to answer when his furious voice exploded through the speaker: ""Have you lost your fucking mind?! You've blown through thirty million in ONE DAY! Are you trying to bankrupt me?!""  
  
""What's the rush?"" Scarlett laughed coldly. ""Once I'm married, you'll have five hundred million coming your way.""  
  
""But that money hasn't arrived yet! If you keep spending like this, the company will declare bankruptcy tomorrow!""  
  
Scarlett's smile turned vicious.  
  
That was exactly what she wanted.  
  
The five hundred million? She'd already planned to have it transferred directly to her personal account after the wedding.  
  
She wanted to see if Lily and her gold-digging mother would still cling so desperately to a broke old man once the money disappeared.  
  
Did they really think everyone was as foolish as her mother? The woman who had stood by her father while he built his empire from nothing, who worked herself into the hospital with stress, only to be driven to suicide in the end?  
  
Thinking of her mother, Scarlett's heart contracted painfully.  
  
Her phone vibrated again with a text from Jackson: \[What's got you in a mood this time? Why didn't you come to the office today?\]  
  
Scarlett stared at the message for a long time.  
  
For the past year, under the guise of Jackson ""disciplining"" her, she'd reported to his office almost daily.  
  
But now that she was about to marry someone else, what was there left for him to discipline?  
  
When she returned to the hotel carrying over a dozen shopping bags, she found her luggage piled unceremoniously in the lobby.  
  
""What the hell is going on?"" she demanded coldly.  
  
The receptionist looked uncomfortable. ""Miss Devereaux, your card... was declined. According to hotel policy...""  
  
Just then, her phone buzzed with a message from her father: \[If you want to sever ties, stop using my money. I've frozen all your accounts.\]  
  
Scarlett stared at the screen for a long time, until her eyes burned.  
  
Finally, she replied with just two words: \[Fine then.\]  
  
Scarlett then dragged her suitcase down the street.  
  
Her flight wasn't until the end of the month, and now she had nowhere to go. Where would she sleep? What would she eat? How would she survive?  
  
Her suitcase was full of wedding dresses and dowry items she couldn't sell. As for borrowing money...  
  
She'd rather sleep on the street than beg from those vultures in her social circle who were waiting to see her fall.  
  
She had just settled on a park bench when a drunk man staggered over.  
  
""Hey beautiful, all alone?"" he slurred.  
  
""Get lost!"" she snapped.  
  
""Don't be like that, sweetie. Keep me company for a while...""  
  
The moment his greasy hand touched her shoulder, Scarlett raised her hand to slap him.  
  
""ARGH!""  
  
Jackson had appeared out of nowhere, viciously twisting the man's wrist.  
  
Before Scarlett could react, she found herself and her luggage bundled into his car.  
  
""Let me go!"" she protested.  
  
Jackson gripped her flailing wrist. ""What drama are you causing now?""  
  
His voice deepened. ""Homeless, and you still wouldn't come to me?""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Those words made Scarlett's nose sting with unexpected emotion.  
  
In the past, whenever she'd fight with her father and run away, Jackson would drive around the entire Boston looking for her, then carry her back home on his back.  
  
""What drama are you causing now?"" He would always ask in that same tone.  
  
She would cling to his back, breathing in the crisp scent of cedar that always surrounded him, naively believing that perhaps he cared for her, even a little.  
  
But now she realized no one was more manipulative than him!  
  
He clearly didn't have feelings for her, yet he slept with her anyway.  
  
Then he'd return to his study to moon over Lily's photographs.  
  
She couldn't understand why she wasn't enough compared to Lily.  
  
In terms of family background, beauty, figure‚Äîhow was she inferior?  
  
Why, of all people, did he have to fall for Lily? Specifically Lily?  
  
""Let GO!"" Scarlett's eyes welled up as she bit Jackson's hand hard.  
  
He frowned slightly but said nothing, simply starting the car.  
  
Jackson drove back to his estate, carrying her luggage inside without hesitation.  
  
""Same as before,"" he said, unbuttoning his cuffs, his tone leaving no room for argument. ""Stay until you're ready to go home.""  
  
Scarlett stood in the entryway, her fingernails digging into her palms. ""I'll only stay for two weeks. After that, I'm leaving this place forever. I'll pay you rent, and I won't bother you anymore.""  
  
""Won't bother me anymore?"" Jackson slowly raised his eyes to look at her, his gaze unfathomable behind those gold-rimmed glasses. ""Are you sure you can manage that?""  
  
Those words cut into her heart like a knife. Scarlett's chest constricted painfully.  
  
So he had known all along.  
  
He'd seen how she'd transformed from initial hostility to complete devotion.  
  
She was hopelessly in love with him.  
  
But what about him? He kept his heart fixated on Lily while coldly watching Scarlett fall deeper and deeper?  
  
""Lily..."" Scarlett suddenly spoke up, ""is my stepmother's daughter. Did you know that?""  
  
Jackson paused in the middle of removing his tie. ""I found out today.""  
  
After a moment of silence, Scarlett couldn't help asking: ""What exactly is your relationship with her?""  
  
""We were at school together,"" Jackson poured himself a glass of water and took a deliberate sip. ""Same university. We worked on the student council together. She saved me during a car accident once, then her health deteriorated and she's been recovering abroad ever since.""  
  
With that, he looked directly at Scarlett, his eyes containing a warning. ""I know you have issues with your stepmother, but this has nothing to do with Lily. Don't target her.""  
  
All the words Scarlett wanted to say became stuck in her throat.  
  
She had planned to ask ""Do you love her?"" but now it seemed laughable.  
  
Seeing how protective he was, what was left to ask?  
  
She turned and retreated to the guest room, slamming the door behind her.  
  
That night, for the first time ever, Jackson didn't come to her.  
  
Scarlett lay in bed, staring at the ceiling blankly.  
  
Of course. His precious Lily was back now. Why would he still bother with her?  
  
The next day, Scarlett deliberately slept until noon, hoping to avoid Jackson.  
  
But when she opened the door, she discovered he was still home.  
  
He sat on the couch, gold-rimmed glasses perched on his straight nose, flipping through a financial magazine.  
  
""Awake?"" he asked without looking up.  
  
""You're not at the office?""  
  
""It's the weekend.""  
  
Scarlett made a noncommittal sound, taking a few pastries from the refrigerator, intending to retreat to her room.  
  
But Jackson suddenly spoke up: ""Change your clothes. We're attending an event together later.""  
  
Scarlett wanted to refuse, but realized she'd rather be out in public than alone with Jackson in the house.  
  
So she changed and went with him.  
  
Only upon arrival did Scarlett discover this was Lily's welcome-home party.  
  
She turned to leave, but Lily enthusiastically caught her arm: ""Sis, I'm so glad you came! Don't fight with Uncle Richard anymore. He was so worried after you left home that he didn't eat for a whole day.""  
  
Scarlett laughed coldly: ""So you know he's just your 'uncle'? Then whether I fight with him or leave home, what business is it of yours? Are you the goddamn neighborhood watch? Mind your own business.""  
  
She yanked her arm away and walked into the private room, catching a glimpse of Lily tearing up and looking pleadingly at Jackson.  
  
Jackson gave Scarlett a dark, warning glance before gently stroking Lily's hair and saying something that made her smile through her tears.  
  
Scarlett's heart stabbed with pain as she tipped back a flute of champagne in one gulp.

He wasn't on my radar at all, and I'm not sure how to respond, if I should accept or politely decline. 

I'm not exactly interested in this guy. He's nice and outgoing, hardworking, polite and respectful. 
But I don't really feel the attraction. I do know it can grow, but the desire isn't really there. 

Another thing to consider is that he's autistic. Now, DO NOT take this out of context and come after me, there's nothing wrong with that, I have some Neurodivergence as well. But it's given me the experience of not having the easiest communication with him in the past, and fidgety people make me kind of anxious. 
I'm not a great communicator. Working on it. 

I also do not drink coffee. Never have due to allergies and that it would probably make my anxiety worse.

1ljyant,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1ljyant/anyone_else_tried_these_keto_acv_gummies_and/,Anyone else tried these keto ACV gummies and actually noticed a change?,"So I‚Äôm not usually one to post reviews, but I‚Äôve noticed **Keto ACV Gummies** getting mentioned more often lately, especially in conversations about stubborn weight loss. Since I‚Äôve actually been trying them for the past 6 weeks, I figured I‚Äôd share what‚Äôs real (and what‚Äôs not) from my own experience.

I went into this as a total skeptic. I‚Äôve tried everything from intermittent fasting to low-carb to just giving up and eating cereal for dinner. But the **ACV keto gummies** trend caught my eye because it didn‚Äôt require a total lifestyle overhaul, and I honestly needed something low-effort that might still do *something*.

**Why I even gave keto gummies a shot**  
I‚Äôm a full-time remote worker, mostly glued to my chair. My energy crashes mid-afternoon, and it‚Äôs been harder to keep the weight off now that I‚Äôm not as active. I didn‚Äôt expect a miracle from some **keto gummies for weight loss**, but I figured I‚Äôd test it for a month and see what happened.

I did a little research beforehand. A lot of the brands push the idea that these **keto ACV gummies** help your body enter ‚Äúketosis‚Äù quicker, meaning instead of burning carbs for energy, your body burns fat. The gummies I used claim to contain full-spectrum **BHB salts** and **apple cider vinegar**, and yeah, the label looked pretty much like every other best keto gummies ad you‚Äôve seen.

**Week 1 ‚Äì immediate fat burn?? Not quite**  
Some reviews promise you‚Äôll lose 5 lbs in the first week, but I didn‚Äôt drop weight instantly. What *did* happen was that I wasn‚Äôt craving snacks like usual. I normally go through crackers, peanut butter, and leftovers while working late, but during that first week, my appetite just‚Ä¶ decreased. I wasn‚Äôt expecting that.

Energy-wise, I did feel a bit more focused. Could‚Äôve been placebo, but I wasn‚Äôt falling asleep at my keyboard, and I only had one cup of coffee each day instead of my usual three.

**Week 2 to 4 ‚Äì subtle but noticeable**  
By the end of the second week, the scale showed 3.6 lbs down. I wasn‚Äôt doing anything extreme with food, but I was more aware of my meals and snacking way less. If you‚Äôre wondering **does keto gummies work for weight loss**, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not instant, but it may support your effort if you‚Äôre even *mildly* mindful.

One surprising thing was how I wasn‚Äôt bloated at all. Usually, I feel puffy by the end of the day (probably from random carb overload), but during this phase, my stomach just felt... flatter? It could be the **ACV** in the gummies helping with digestion. I know some people use apple cider vinegar on its own, but this form was a lot easier to take.

If you're curious about what I used, this is the same kind I got: [**Keto ACV Gummies - see full info here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2L8QR5SR/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)

**Week 5 to 6 ‚Äì real fat loss or just water weight?**  
Around week five, I plateaued. No more scale drops. But I *did* notice a change in how my clothes fit. My jeans, which used to pinch at the waist, actually felt comfortable again. That was more meaningful to me than the number on the scale.

One thing to point out: I looked up the **keto gummies ingredients** and the main ones were BHB ketones, apple cider vinegar powder, pectin (instead of gelatin), and stevia. It‚Äôs nice they didn‚Äôt use artificial sweeteners or dyes. No weird aftertaste either, which is rare with **ACV keto gummies**.

I didn‚Äôt experience any obvious **keto gummies side effect**, but I‚Äôve read some people get headaches if they don‚Äôt drink enough water while taking BHB products. That wasn‚Äôt an issue for me.

**Are keto gummies the magic answer? No. But‚Ä¶**  
Here‚Äôs the thing. If you're expecting to drop 30 lbs while eating pizza and never exercising, this won‚Äôt work. But if you‚Äôre trying to cut cravings, support your energy, and give yourself a gentle push toward ketosis, these might help.

I‚Äôve seen people ask **how does keto gummies work** \- in theory, the BHB salts help your body shift into ketosis faster, which means it may begin burning fat instead of carbs for energy. That‚Äôs the basis for most **keto weight loss supplements**. Whether you‚Äôre in full ketosis or not probably depends on your overall diet, but for someone not doing strict keto, I still felt benefits.

Also, I saw someone post about **keto gummies CVS**. I didn‚Äôt see the exact ones I used at CVS, but there are knockoff brands that seem to be flooding stores now. Some are legit, but some look pretty sketchy. I stuck with one that had reviews and real ingredient info, like this one here:  
[**Keto Gummies Review ‚Äì product info and details**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2L8QR5SR/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)

**Final thoughts**  
If you're looking for **do keto gummies work**, my answer is: *They helped me, but only because I also put in a little effort*. I didn‚Äôt overhaul my life, but I paid more attention to what I was eating, and the gummies seemed to reinforce those better choices.

I‚Äôd call it a **support tool**, not a solution. And not all **keto gummies reviews** are equal - some people have unrealistic expectations, others probably never even tried the product. Just track your own results and take the hype with a grain of salt.

Let me know if anyone else tried **ACV keto gummies** and what your experience was like. I‚Äôm still debating if I should continue beyond month two or test something else next.",1,1750832433.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False
