1meewf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Costa/comments/1meewf6/unsure_if_this_is_the_right_job_for_me/,Unsure if this is the right job for me,"Hey! I jjst started a new job at Costa and I've had 5 shifts so far. 

I have plenty of barista experience as both a barista and also a waitress who loved to make the coffees. I'm not new to a coffee machine or working on my feet. 

My last job was really good and I'm going to miss it but unfortunately the owner of the business is retiring and decided to sell it (as well as all of the older staff leaving while I was away for 6 months). It was a very very fast paced job and I loved it. I was very good at my job and I loved talking to people and having good banter with my co-workers. 

Now that I'm back from my 6 month study abroad I got a new job at Costa, and its okay. The location is really convenient, barely a 5 minute walk from my appartment and they're willing to let me work weekends while I'm at college. 

There's two problems that I've found while working there. The first problem I'm not sure if its a real problem or I'm just experiencing change. 

The Costa I work at is not very busy, it can get busy but that never lasts for long. It's usually a very steady stream of one or two customers coming in at once. There's rarely a line longer than 5 people. Oftentimes I've struggled to manage my time because I'm so used to having to do everything with speed. I find it difficult to slow down and take my time. Have any of you dealt with this and do you get used to it? Or do you still crave that crazy rush lol. 

The biggest problem I have is my co workers. At my last job I had great craic with all of my co workers and got along with them pretty well. My manager was very fair and fun and chatty as were all my other coworkers. Here at Costa though, I try to strike a conversation with all but one of mh coworkers and i barely get a response. I am aware that this is probably due to me being new and they need more time to warm up to me but it feels more than them not knowing me well. Two particular coworkers act annoyed and almost offended that I would talk to them. They also don't let me work the till or coffee machine despite me being capable and have done so on other shifts with other coworkers. When i ask questions they act as if I am stupid and belittle me in a very condescending way. It doesn't really bother me because I know that I can do my job well with and in a few weeks I will have everything down. 

I'm not worried whether they like me or think I'm annoying or bad at my job, I just worry for the culture that I'm going to have to subject myself to if I want to keep working there. It's not the end of the world, but it does make me miss my old job and I'm wondering if you have any advice or simillar experiences?

When we first got him, he was really easy to play with. Running around the coffee table, all sorts of flips, etc. He always had his preferred toys but he went nuts for them whenever we pulled them out.

As of 2-3 months ago, he has started batting/nipping at us, particularly my fiance. It doesn't seem mean, more playful, but it can be kinda scary and he has drawn blood with his claws. It feels like we're his prey when he does this. At the same time, he's dramatically less interested in the toys he used to love, and when we can get him to play it's only in really short bursts. He doesn't play until he's tired the way he used to. He is just as snuggly as ever. 

Here is what I have tried:

* Lots and lots of new/different styles of toys. Not interested in any of them.
* Vet says he's in perfect health.
* Watching Jackson Galaxy videos on how to play with him; didn't make a difference.
* Ignoring him when he bats/nips instead of giving him attention. This sort of worked for me and he hasn't nipped at me in a while, but he still does it to my fiance despite my fiance also trying this.

Nothing particular changed in our apartment/lifestyle that I can pinpoint as the cause.

Any other advice? Do other people's cats do this and what worked for you? Do you think it might be because he and my fiance are both male? Is it gender-related? I would honestly just love to get him playing again.",3,1753998967.0,cats,0,1.0,False

From customer onboarding in fintech to compliance checks in financial services and real-time ticketing in ICT. They‚Äôre faster, cheaper and don‚Äôt need coffee breaks.

But here‚Äôs the plot twist: In South Africa, where unemployment is high and transformation targets are real, is this tech revolution helping or hurting?

On one hand, AI agents free up human teams to do more complex, high-value work, strategy, innovation, client relationships. On the other hand, if not integrated responsibly, they risk reinforcing the same inequalities transformation was designed to fix.

It all depends on who‚Äôs designing the systems and whether AI is being used to replace people or to retrain them.

Some consulting firms are already building hybrid models: AI + people + data, with a sharp eye on B-BBEE, skills development and SED impact. Done right, AI doesn‚Äôt kill jobs, it creates new ones. Think prompt engineers, AI trainers, digital compliance officers. Roles that didn‚Äôt even exist 5 years ago.

So here‚Äôs the question: Should your business be using AI agents? Probably.
Should you do it blindly? Absolutely not.
Done with intention, AI can be a catalyst for actual transformation not just a way to cut costs.

Curious? Ask yourself what your data, people and compliance processes would look like if you built them today. That‚Äôs where the real opportunity lies.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Medvedev vs. Popyrin: A Parlay of Precision and Puns**

The ATP Canadian Open‚Äôs third-round clash between Daniil Medvedev and Alexei Popyrin is a match of contrasts: a robotic Russian tactician vs. an Australian rollercoaster. Let‚Äôs dissect this like a tennis-shaped Sudoku puzzle, blending stats, spreads, and slapstick.

---

### Parse the Odds: Medvedev‚Äôs Immaculate Machine vs. Popyrin‚Äôs Wild Card

Medvedev (-3.5 game spread, 1.71 implied odds) is the ATP‚Äôs version of a Roomba on hardcourts‚Äîrelentless, efficient, and slightly unsettling in its consistency. His 15-8 hardcourt record this year and a 4-1 head-to-head edge over Popyrin (including a recent straight-sets thrashing at the Italian Open) make him a statistical titan. Popyrin (+3.5, 1.98), meanwhile, is a defending champion with a seven-match Canadian Open streak, but his 4-5 form in his last five matches suggests he‚Äôs a late-night infomercial for ‚ÄúHow to Win a Title, Then Forget How.‚Äù

The total games line sits at 22.5, with both Over and Under at 1.83 odds. Given Medvedev‚Äôs tiebreak victory over Dalibor Svrcina (7-6, 6-4) and Popyrin‚Äôs nail-biting win over Nicolas Arseneault (7-6, 6-3), both players are coming off matches where tension was the main event. But Medvedev‚Äôs precision (he‚Äôs the only man who could serve aces into a coffee mug) likely keeps games tight.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Shoelaces

Medvedev‚Äôs only ‚Äúinjury‚Äù this year is the collective exhaustion of his opponents, who‚Äôve grown numb from facing his 128 mph first serve. Popyrin, however, is a human version of ‚ÄúThe Little Engine That Could‚Äù‚Äîhis seven-match Canadian Open streak is impressive, but his recent form (4 losses in 5) reads like a cautionary tale about relying on momentum.

Recent matches? Medvedev survived a tiebreak like a man escaping a sinking Titanic,

I've been smoking quite a bit over the last few months. Pretty hard times. Been doing an internship with zero prospects of being hired, low salary, been studying for multiple tests and job interviews... I simply started smoking again. 
I started buying tobacco again. 

We started chatting, we were long distance, we waited to meet each other. It happened, we tried to make it happen again. I visited him, I remember at the time I was thinking ""what if this is my chance to be happy?"". We had wonderful times together, bur also awful times. It's weird. I felt we were on this rollercoaster together and both of us incapable of changing the dynamic, even though everything was so new. 

I came back home and kept hating my routine and smoking, even if sometimes it gives me nausea (I found out that coffee early in the morning gives me nausea, and I usually drank coffee and smoked right after). We kept calling each other's, texting, being cute to each other's. But sometimes we argued.
And we were apart. 

Long story short: it ended a few weeks ago, after I visited him the second time (he couldn't visit because I don't live in my own and I didn't want for him either to waste money in hotels). 

I'm thinking about the things I didn't like about him, his behavior... And I noticed that I've basically quitted smoking. 
It is also true that I recently took one of my last tests, at least for now. So that kind of stress is over. 
  But I think that my body is saying ""look, you're doing good even without it, even without him"". And it's a bit sad. Because sometimes we were discussing that I smoke too much. He didn't judge me but this was an issue for me. And now that we aren't together anymore, I've stopped. Like this was the answer all the time. 

Have you guys experienced something similar? Why the rollercoaster thing? I keep saying myself I need time and I also need to grieve this bond. He would have liked to commit, to try at least... But I felt it was too soon. I felt that the more I was looking for jobs in my city, the more I was going on my separate way. Sometimes I also think I might be attracted to girls. Once, I caught myself thinking ""woa, if we officially date, and we're monogamous like he wants, it means I'll never be with a girl in my life"", and I suddenly became anxious. 

When I was up with him on the rollercoaster the scenery looked awesome, but we had this amazing ability to switch from awesome to awful within seconds.
Can someone relate to what I'm saying? 

I know I need time. But it's sad cuz I don't know whether we'll talk to each other again. I keep thinking about the possibility to meet him in our hometown at Xmas (we were LDR, and we now live in different cities, but we come from the same hometown, no joke, no AI involved). 

He was part of my life for six months. I'm thankful because he gave me a lot, and I'm aware that something inside me was saying that I was not entirely comfortable... But still, it's sad. 

I see girlfriends of mine who are in beautiful relationships, and I ask myself whether it will ever happen to me. Something good that lasts. ",1,1753998490.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1mee9au,https://www.reddit.com/r/moraldilemmas/comments/1mee9au/did_i_fumble_our_relationship/,Did I fumble our relationship?,"I live in a student dorm and I met a girl in December. We kicked it off immediately, eyes locked in at first sight. Chrismtas break was approaching and I had to leave for my homeland. I asked her if we could just have coffee before I leave and she agreed. We talked for like 2 hours, both very interested in one another. She was gorgeous, and she had tattoos on the same body parts as me. We kissed on the first date and I felt super happy on my trip home.

After coming back, it took like a month for us to see each other again. When we did, we met up in my room, we just talked and listened to music. One thing led to another and we just started making out in my bed. That lasted for half an hour until my horny brain thought it was the right time to pull her pants down. When I reached, she said to stop and I IMMEDIATELY stopped. Took my hands off her, we continued talking and started making out again. At the end of the date, she said she is going to her room to masturbate to all of this (never had a girl tell me that, sounded hot).

I asked her out to go on a real date multiple times and she always had an excuse. Now I don‚Äôt judge but after the 3rd time I got pissed and straight up asked her: ‚ÄúAre you playing games with me?‚Äù That ended in a long ass night of texting and saying stuff she might have meant or not. She said I was honestly the best guy she met and might want to keep me for marriage. I was thrilled but I couldn‚Äôt get rid of the idea something was off. 

So I apologised for the tone I used in the text and we met the next morning in her room where she confessed to me that she is dealing with 2 battles in her life: Multiple sclerosis and alcoholism. I was shocked and felt like shit. I immediately went supportive mode, kissed her on the head and told her I want to protect her from all the harm in the world (we were both buzzing with butterflies). After that, we just went silent with me texting her here and there.

Ffw like 2-3 months, we barely hear from each other bc life. We meet in the elevator randomly, she asks me if we can go out again. I say yes. We start texting again and I offer her a dinner at a fancy restaurant. I had done some odd jobs that week and I wanted to spend it all on her. Again, that date comes by and she hits me up with the ‚ÄúSorry, I really don‚Äôt feel like going out.‚Äù I should have just ended it there honestly, but fuck it, I really wanted to see her because I was still struck with butterflies. So I ask her ok, let‚Äôs just take a walk through our neighbourhood.

And this date was horrible. From the get-go, I could feel something different about her. Something was off, as if she had consumed some substance. We smoked weed in a park, chilled and started talking about life plans. This is where I figured out we don‚Äôt really have the same view on life. She talked from a more privileged point of view by saying that people should do whatever they like in life even if it doesn‚Äôt make money. I said the contrary, people should focus on what they are good at but which has the highest financial benefit. And there were other awkward instances where we just weren‚Äôt on the same page (she wanted to go left, I wanted to go right etc.) after that, we went up to my floor, the hallway with a big window. I lit up a cigarette and we were both showing signs that we were tired. I walk her to the elevator and I give her a kiss goodnight, which was our last one.

Some time passes, we don‚Äôt text each other at all. Then I hit her up asking to meet up again. She says yes. But then a few days later out of the blue writes this: 
‚ÄúHey
Ive given it a second thought and I don't find it necessary for us to meet today. You've overstepped the boundary many times and displayed sexual behaviorism that's been inappropriate for the situation. That's absolutely unacceptable to me. Regardless of your reasons, l'd rather keep my safety. It's fine still to say hi when we cross paths or meet in the elevator, but I don't wish to engage in anything beyond that.
Best xx‚Äù
I was flabbergasted.

I cut all contact with her and there was an instance where someone on my floor had OD‚Äôd and we called the ambulance. People from all floors came to see what‚Äôs up and she was also there. She was with her friend. The whole conversation was between me and her friend and I did not even look at her for a second. They left and I could hear her laughing in the elevator. I was devastated but I felt like the righteous thing to do was just ignore her. 

A few more times we saw each other randomly. One time I was wearing her favorite sports fit that I wear and she was looking at me for a solid 10 seconds before I looked back and she quickly walked away. 

Anyways, it‚Äôs not much of a story. It just hurt me because she was the first girl who made me feel warm inside, I hadn‚Äôt felt that rush of love since high school. But every time she ghosted me in texts, I felt cold and uncomfortable. I guess I was just too overly attached to something that was never meant to be.

Give me your honest opinion; how and in which way did I fuck up? Should I have said hi to her after all that drama? Where did she go wrong? I just want to clear things because sometimes I get the urge to text her again but I would never.",1,1753997779.0,moraldilemmas,2,1.0,False

But apparently if you buy anything that isn't beans and rice, you're basically a financial train wreck according to some people. Yesterday my roommate decided to give me a whole ted talk about priorities because I bought a new ps5 controller. This man orders doordash practically every other day but wants to lecture ME about money management. 

Here's the thing though like my rent's paid, bills are current, and I can actually afford the controller. My old one had stick drift so bad that my character would just spin in circles like they were having an existential crisis. But somehow replacing essential gaming equipment makes me financially reckless? I'm out here eating meal prep salads that have seen better days, working 50+ hour weeks, and actually being responsible with my money. But the second I spend $60 on something that brings me joy, suddenly I need an intervention about fiscal responsibility.

When did we decide that being good with money means you're not allowed to enjoy any of it? Like yeah, save for emergencies and retirement, but also maybe don't live like a monk if you can afford not to? Anyone else deal with this kind of financial gatekeeping? It's exhausting having people police your spending when they have zero context about your actual situation.""",31,1753997778.0,Vent,5,1.0,False

Do you feel like you‚Äôre made of contradictions? Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn‚Äôt meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 25, based in Italy currently visiting Germany, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life‚Äôs not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won‚Äôt just get me, but who‚Äôs also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren‚Äôt a priority for you, we‚Äôre not meant for each other.

But this post isn‚Äôt just about politics. It‚Äôs about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go ‚Äúso I was just thinking...‚Äù

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there‚Äôs beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn‚Äôt found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night ‚Äúwhat even is happiness?‚Äù kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who‚Äôll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other‚Äôs chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

If any of this resonates, I'd like to get to know you. Tell me who you are when no one‚Äôs watching. Share your favorite lyric, your latest overthought idea, or just say hi. No filters needed. I'd prefer if we're in the same timezone",1,1753997679.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.6,False
1mee7ji,https://www.reddit.com/r/IMadeThis/comments/1mee7ji/my_babys_nightlight_keeps_turning_on/,My Baby's Nightlight Keeps Turning On,"Have you ever had that paranoid feeling that someone has been watching even when they aren't there? I have no proof to back up this manic episode I had in the middle of the night, but something just isn't adding up.

I have a friend who works in cybersecurity, and he would always mention how baby monitors can get hacked if you use the ones that connect to the wifi. Now I've known this guy my whole life, since he's been my best friend, so I'm not inclined to ever call him a liar. While he did recommend a few, we eventually put one on our baby shower wishlist.¬†

This baby monitor \*can\* connect to the wifi, but we have never done that, due to the safety concerns my friend had mentioned, even though it would be easier to connect to the app on my phone to view what the monitor sees, instead of always waiting for the monitor screen to turn on, which took I kid you not a full minute to power on. It even had excessive features like changing the color of the nightlight and playing calming sounds, which we rarely used since they never helped put her to sleep.

We have the camera plugged into the wall, but we always have to remember to turn the light switch on otherwise the camera won't work since that is how that outlet is set up, and we can't be bothered to move the camera to a different spot on the wall.

One afternoon I passed by our baby's bedroom and the camera's nightlight was on, glowing white. We never turned this on because we never needed to‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶why is it on? I didn't turn it on. Annoyed and confused, I grabbed the monitor, turned it on, waited a full minute for it to load, and sure enough the Nightlight icon was actively on. I go into the settings of the monitor to turn it off.

The Nightlight turns back on 3 seconds later.

I turn it off again.¬†

It turns on again.¬†

No‚Ä¶this is a glitch. It has to be. It doesn't make sense otherwise.¬†

Off.

On.

Off.

On.

No matter how many times I turn it off, it is persistent and fighting my command. So I turned off the light switch, powering down the camera since we didn't need it at the moment.¬†

Finally. It turned off.

But‚Ä¶I still had this creeping possibility lingering in the back of my head. Why?

I scoured the internet to see if anyone else had this problem with this particular model, but to no avail. Surely this has happened before‚Ä¶

That night, as I was laying in bed, I turned to my left to face the monitor and something caught my eye. It looked like dust particles flying across the corner of the screen. I've seen these before, it probably was a bug or dust or something like that. I turned off the monitor screen as I lay my head on the pillow to sleep.¬†

Honestly, I was just happy our kid was finally asleep since we've had some troubles putting her to sleep. We'd be up all night, taking shifts every hour in an attempt to drift her to snores at bedtime. So to see her, peaceful and still on the monitor, meant that we finally got to sleep before we had to go to work in a few hours. Good thing coffee exists.¬†

After a few minutes I then got up to use the bathroom and once I walked out of the bedroom, I immediately froze as I looked at our child's bedroom door that was slightly ajar spilling a crimson hue through the crack. The Nightlight was on in the middle of the night and it was glowing red.¬†

Fighting every possible urge to not scream in the middle of the pitch black night illuminated by one sole angry ray, I slowly creaked the door to enter only to hear the door do the screaming for me as it sounded like it was dying for its last breath as it scrapped at a snail's pace. Once the door was open just enough for me to squeeze through into the room, I got on my hands and knees as I crawled to the outlet. As I reached for the cord to unplug the camera in a desperately quiet attempt to fix the camera, I heard a rustling from the crib that nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked into the crib to see her just changing positions in her sleep, which was typical. Once I could tell she was sound asleep again, I unplugged the cord from the wall‚Ä¶waited a few seconds‚Ä¶then plugged it back in.¬†

The Nightlight was off.

‚Ä¶

And it stayed off.

After a silent sigh of relief, I crawled out of the room, stood up, and went to the bathroom. Once I finished I entered my bedroom, shut my door, and walked over to my bed. As I laid down once again, legs in blanket, head on pillow, blanket over chest, I turned to my left again and remembered I had turned off the screen. I then realized I forgot to check that Nightlight icon on the screen earlier. Was it there? I was so tired I honestly don't remember. If the light was on then the icon was on, so it must have been.¬†

I pressed the button one last time.

I waited for a minute as I counted the passing seconds‚Ä¶

1mee7bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllureStories/comments/1mee7bb/my_babys_nightlight_keeps_turning_on/,My Baby's Nightlight Keeps Turning On,"Have you ever had that paranoid feeling that someone has been watching even when they aren't there? I have no proof to back up this manic episode I had in the middle of the night, but something just isn't adding up.

I have a friend who works in cybersecurity, and he would always mention how baby monitors can get hacked if you use the ones that connect to the wifi. Now I've known this guy my whole life, since he's been my best friend, so I'm not inclined to ever call him a liar. While he did recommend a few, we eventually put one on our baby shower wishlist.¬†

This baby monitor \*can\* connect to the wifi, but we have never done that, due to the safety concerns my friend had mentioned, even though it would be easier to connect to the app on my phone to view what the monitor sees, instead of always waiting for the monitor screen to turn on, which took I kid you not a full minute to power on. It even had excessive features like changing the color of the nightlight and playing calming sounds, which we rarely used since they never helped put her to sleep.

We have the camera plugged into the wall, but we always have to remember to turn the light switch on otherwise the camera won't work since that is how that outlet is set up, and we can't be bothered to move the camera to a different spot on the wall.

One afternoon I passed by our baby's bedroom and the camera's nightlight was on, glowing white. We never turned this on because we never needed to‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶why is it on? I didn't turn it on. Annoyed and confused, I grabbed the monitor, turned it on, waited a full minute for it to load, and sure enough the Nightlight icon was actively on. I go into the settings of the monitor to turn it off.

The Nightlight turns back on 3 seconds later.

I turn it off again.¬†

It turns on again.¬†

No‚Ä¶this is a glitch. It has to be. It doesn't make sense otherwise.¬†

Off.

On.

Off.

On.

No matter how many times I turn it off, it is persistent and fighting my command. So I turned off the light switch, powering down the camera since we didn't need it at the moment.¬†

Finally. It turned off.

But‚Ä¶I still had this creeping possibility lingering in the back of my head. Why?

I scoured the internet to see if anyone else had this problem with this particular model, but to no avail. Surely this has happened before‚Ä¶

That night, as I was laying in bed, I turned to my left to face the monitor and something caught my eye. It looked like dust particles flying across the corner of the screen. I've seen these before, it probably was a bug or dust or something like that. I turned off the monitor screen as I lay my head on the pillow to sleep.¬†

Honestly, I was just happy our kid was finally asleep since we've had some troubles putting her to sleep. We'd be up all night, taking shifts every hour in an attempt to drift her to snores at bedtime. So to see her, peaceful and still on the monitor, meant that we finally got to sleep before we had to go to work in a few hours. Good thing coffee exists.¬†

After a few minutes I then got up to use the bathroom and once I walked out of the bedroom, I immediately froze as I looked at our child's bedroom door that was slightly ajar spilling a crimson hue through the crack. The Nightlight was on in the middle of the night and it was glowing red.¬†

Fighting every possible urge to not scream in the middle of the pitch black night illuminated by one sole angry ray, I slowly creaked the door to enter only to hear the door do the screaming for me as it sounded like it was dying for its last breath as it scrapped at a snail's pace. Once the door was open just enough for me to squeeze through into the room, I got on my hands and knees as I crawled to the outlet. As I reached for the cord to unplug the camera in a desperately quiet attempt to fix the camera, I heard a rustling from the crib that nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked into the crib to see her just changing positions in her sleep, which was typical. Once I could tell she was sound asleep again, I unplugged the cord from the wall‚Ä¶waited a few seconds‚Ä¶then plugged it back in.¬†

The Nightlight was off.

‚Ä¶

And it stayed off.

After a silent sigh of relief, I crawled out of the room, stood up, and went to the bathroom. Once I finished I entered my bedroom, shut my door, and walked over to my bed. As I laid down once again, legs in blanket, head on pillow, blanket over chest, I turned to my left again and remembered I had turned off the screen. I then realized I forgot to check that Nightlight icon on the screen earlier. Was it there? I was so tired I honestly don't remember. If the light was on then the icon was on, so it must have been.¬†

I pressed the button one last time.

I waited for a minute as I counted the passing seconds‚Ä¶

Why?

* The coffee quality has gone downhill for years. Many people say it tastes burnt, watery, or inconsistent.
* The food menu has expanded so much that it feels like a Jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none situation. Most items taste frozen, reheated, or mass-produced.
* It used to be a symbol of Canadian culture and community, but now it feels more like a faceless fast food chain run by a Brazilian holding company. The ‚ÄúCanadian identity‚Äù is mostly just marketing nostalgia.
* Local coffee shops and bakeries could thrive if Tim‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt everywhere on every corner, giving us more variety, better quality, and more support for small businesses.

We kicked it off immediately, eyes locked in at first sight. Chrismtas break was approaching and I had to leave for my homeland. I asked her if we could just have coffee before I leave and she agreed. We talked for like 2 hours, both very interested in one another. She was gorgeous, and she had tattoos on the same body parts as me. We kissed on the first date and I felt super happy on my trip home.

After coming back, it took like a month for us to see each other again. When we did, we met up in my room, we just talked and listened to music. One thing led to another and we just started making out in my bed. That lasted for half an hour until my horny brain thought it was the right time to pull her pants down. When I reached, she said to stop and I IMMEDIATELY stopped. Took my hands off her, we continued talking and started making out again. At the end of the date, she said she is going to her room to masturbate to all of this (never had a girl tell me that, sounded hot).

I asked her out to go on a real date multiple times and she always had an excuse. Now I don‚Äôt judge but after the 3rd time I got pissed and straight up asked her: ‚ÄúAre you playing games with me?‚Äù That ended in a long ass night of texting and saying stuff she might have meant or not. She said I was honestly the best guy she met and might want to keep me for marriage. I was thrilled but I couldn‚Äôt get rid of the idea something was off. 

So I apologised for the tone I used in the text and we met the next morning in her room where she confessed to me that she is dealing with 2 battles in her life: Multiple sclerosis and alcoholism. I was shocked and felt like shit. I immediately went supportive mode, kissed her on the head and told her I want to protect her from all the harm in the world (we were both buzzing with butterflies). After that, we just went silent with me texting her here and there.

Ffw like 2-3 months, we barely hear from each other bc life. We meet in the elevator randomly, she asks me if we can go out again. I say yes. We start texting again and I offer her a dinner at a fancy restaurant. I had done some odd jobs that week and I wanted to spend it all on her. Again, that date comes by and she hits me up with the ‚ÄúSorry, I really don‚Äôt feel like going out.‚Äù I should have just ended it there honestly, but fuck it, I really wanted to see her because I was still struck with butterflies. So I ask her ok, let‚Äôs just take a walk through our neighbourhood.

And this date was horrible. From the get-go, I could feel something different about her. Something was off, as if she had consumed some substance. We smoked weed in a park, chilled and started talking about life plans. This is where I figured out we don‚Äôt really have the same view on life. She talked from a more privileged point of view by saying that people should do whatever they like in life even if it doesn‚Äôt make money. I said the contrary, people should focus on what they are good at but which has the highest financial benefit. And there were other awkward instances where we just weren‚Äôt on the same page (she wanted to go left, I wanted to go right etc.) after that, we went up to my floor, the hallway with a big window. I lit up a cigarette and we were both showing signs that we were tired. I walk her to the elevator and I give her a kiss goodnight, which was our last one.

Some time passes, we don‚Äôt text each other at all. Then I hit her up asking to meet up again. She says yes. But then a few days later out of the blue writes this: 
‚ÄúHey
Ive given it a second thought and I don't find it necessary for us to meet today. You've overstepped the boundary many times and displayed sexual behaviorism that's been inappropriate for the situation. That's absolutely unacceptable to me. Regardless of your reasons, l'd rather keep my safety. It's fine still to say hi when we cross paths or meet in the elevator, but I don't wish to engage in anything beyond that.

I was flabbergasted.

I cut all contact with her and there was an instance where someone on my floor had OD‚Äôd and we called the ambulance. People from all floors came to see what‚Äôs up and she was also there. She was with her friend. The whole conversation was between me and her friend and I did not even look at her for a second. They left and I could hear her laughing in the elevator. I was devastated but I felt like the righteous thing to do was just ignore her. 

A few more times we saw each other randomly. One time I was wearing her favorite sports fit that I wear and she was looking at me for a solid 10 seconds before I looked back and she quickly walked away. 

Anyways, it‚Äôs not much of a story. It just hurt me because she was the first girl who made me feel warm inside, I hadn‚Äôt felt that rush of love since high school. But every time she ghosted me in texts, I felt cold and uncomfortable. I guess I was just too overly attached to something that was never meant to be.

Its been two months since I left. I found hinge on his phone, along with a screenshot of his profile where he manually changed his location. Turns out, he had been logging into the app off and on ever month since January, which is the month we started dating. He denied it, cried and tried to get me to stay. Told me I was the love of his life. Never fully admitted to having the app at all. My trust was so broken, I was and still am destroyed. I loved him a lot. I stayed with him through him loosing his job and an apartment. He would always tell me how much he loved me, he would take me out and surprise me with cooking dinner. I had no idea any of this was going on. 

  
So when he reached out this week-not asking but basically insinuating that I would want to- meet for coffee to ""catch-up"", I was so angry. Does he not understand anything that happened? why is he acting like we mutually broke up.  **When we left each other, I did tell him that I would want to talk again only when he 1. has his shit together (a new job and an apartment), but 2. has changed and understands what he has done.** 

But with time, I realize I don't think he will ever change. He has a dopamine addiction (gambling, weed and alch, and now this- swiping on dating apps and probably other things...). I just feel bad that I blocked him and I'm not giving him an explanation that I have changed and don't want to talk. I mean like yeah, I want to talk. But to the person I first met. Not this cheating, lying, shell of a man. 

My heart aches. It aches for myself because of what he did. It aches that I know what is best for me is to block and not respond to him asking to ""catch-up"". because I know it would set me back so much farther.

1mee344,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mee344,Farmerleaf Spring 2025 Lao Man E Gushu raw puer,"7.2g/100 mL, just off boil

Wash (10s) - aroma punchy young sheng notes but underlying sweetness 

Steep 1 (flash) - bitterness is light so far, but still coats the tongue in typical Lao Man E fashion, a little bit of cacao/coffee bean note mixed in with herbal hay notes. Sweetness already starting up in finish.

Steep 2 (flash) - immediate bite of bitterness on the tip of the tongue, fading quickly but never disappears. Slight smoky or roast vibe that integrates with faint bitterness - continues to present as cacao nibs. Sweetness picking up but still relatively late in finish

Steep 3 (5s) - less intensity of bitterness than a typical Lao Man'E, but still ever-present. Getting sweetness much earlier now. Chocolate covered cherries

Steep 4 (10s) - nearly burnt my mouth in a rush to dig into the next steep, continuing the arc of slightly toasty bitterness, moving to the side as sweetness comes in

Steep 5 (15s) - bitterness steps back literally a fraction of a second after it hits the tongue, sweetness starts to fade in immediately. My face is starting to numb up a bit as the energy is starting to build 

Steep 6 (20s) - bitter yet refreshing, not getting boatload of fruit, but there is a touch of acidity that complements the flavors, sweetness has coated my teeth as well as my cheeks and gums

Steep 7 (30s) - keeping on trajectory, cherry and citrus candy on finish

Steep 8+ (45s+) - as bitterness slowly fades in later steeps, getting some floral notes in the open mouth before fruit candy kicks in

1mee2w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1mee2w7/today_i_finally_blocked_my_cheating_ex_after_he/,Today I finally blocked my cheating ex after he texted me two days ago.,"I 23F finally blocked my ex bf (27M) on imessage today. Its been two months since I left. I found hinge on his phone, along with a screenshot of his profile where he manually changed his location. Turns out, he had been logging into the app off and on ever month since January, which is the month we started dating. He denied it, cried and tried to get me to stay. Told me I was the love of his life. Never fully admitted to having the app at all. My trust was so broken, I was and still am destroyed. I loved him a lot. I stayed with him through him loosing his job and an apartment. He would always tell me how much he loved me, he would take me out and surprise me with cooking dinner. I had no idea any of this was going on. 

  
So when he reached out this week-not asking but basically demanding- that we meet for coffee to ""catch-up"", I was so angry. Does he not understand anything that happened? why is he acting like we mutually broke up. 

  
When we left each other, I did tell him that I would want to talk again only when he 1. has his shit together (a new job and an apartment), but 2. has changed and understands what he has done. 

But with time, I realize I don't think he will ever change. He has a dopamine addiction (gambling, weed and alch, and now this- swiping on dating apps and probably other things...). I just feel bad that I blocked him and I'm not giving him an explanation that I have changed and don't want to talk. I mean like yeah, I want to talk. But to the person I first met. Not this cheating, lying, shell of a man. 

  
My heart aches. It aches for myself because of what he did. It aches that I know what is best for me is to block and not respond to him asking to ""catch-up"". because I know it would set me back so much farther. This week ever since he texted ive felt sad again and down. ",3,1753997357.0,heartbreak,3,1.0,False

1medwmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/passportdiaries/comments/1medwmd/three_perfect_days_munich/,Three Perfect Days: Munich,"Munich: The Bavarian capital. It started as a small monastery settlement on the banks of the Isar River almost 900 years ago. Today, it‚Äôs a city where old-world charm collides with a cutting-edge tech hub.

Munich is beer gardens under chestnut trees, Gothic churches and a skyline pierced with Alpine views. With just under 1.5 million people, it feels both intimate and full of life. Whether the draw is Oktoberfest, art museums, or simply the smell of fresh pretzels in Marienplatz, Munich is a city that doesn‚Äôt try too hard‚Äîit just is.

# Day 1

**Old Town and history underfoot**

Things to do and see  
Start with a slow morning at **Caf√© Frischhut**, a local bakery known for Schmalznudeln (a kind of Bavarian donut). Strong coffee in one hand, sugar-dusted pastry in the other‚Äîclassic fuel.

A few steps away, Marienplatz opens like a stage. The **Neues Rathaus** (New Town Hall) dominates the square with Gothic spires. If you catch the 11 a.m. Glockenspiel performance, you‚Äôll see mechanical figures twirl and joust, a charming tradition since 1908.

Walk toward the **Frauenkirche**, the twin-domed cathedral that survived WWII bombings and remains a symbol of the city.

From there, Munich‚Äôs royal past is on full display at the **Residenz**, a sprawling former palace filled with frescoed ceilings, jeweled chambers, and a courtyard that whispers stories of dukes and kings.

For lunch, grab a seat at **Hofbr√§uhaus**. Yes, it‚Äôs touristy. Yes, it‚Äôs worth it once. Order a Ma√ü (one-liter beer) and roast pork with potato dumplings.

Spend the afternoon wandering **Viktualienmarkt**, Munich‚Äôs open-air market since 1807. The stalls brim with cheeses, fresh flowers, sausages, and jars of local honey.

Dinner? Go for **Dallmayr Bar & Grill**, an elegant spot above a historic delicatessen. After, walk back to Marienplatz‚Äîthe square at night is magic, with soft yellow light bouncing off cobblestones.

# Day 2

**Art, gardens, and a different pace**

Begin with the **English Garden**, one of Europe‚Äôs largest urban parks. Locals surf the standing wave at Eisbach, while further along, beer gardens serve pretzels and radlers beneath tall trees.

Head south to the **Alte Pinakothek**, an art museum housing centuries of European masters. If modern art is more appealing, the Pinakothek der Moderne is just across the street.

Pro tip: The museums in Munich are close together‚Äîpick one or two and linger.

For lunch, make your way to **Schumann‚Äôs**, a Munich classic for simple dishes done perfectly.

In the afternoon, wander Schwabing, once the city‚Äôs bohemian quarter. Small boutiques, antique bookstores, and caf√©s spill onto quiet streets.

Dinner is at **Tantris**, Munich‚Äôs two-Michelin-starred legend. The interior is a time capsule of 1970s design, and the tasting menu leans into local ingredients with a modern spin.

Cap the night at **Zephyr Bar**, known for inventive cocktails.

**Day 3**

**BMWs, beer, and beyond**

If cars are a passion, start at **BMW Welt** and the **BMW Museum**. Even non-enthusiasts find themselves impressed by the engineering on display.

Next, take the U-Bahn to **Olympiapark**, built for the 1972 Olympics. The sweeping tent-like architecture is striking, and there‚Äôs an option to climb to the top of the roof or ride up the Olympic Tower for a panoramic view.

Lunch at **Augustiner-Keller**, one of the city‚Äôs oldest beer gardens, is a must. Order a plate of Wei√üwurst (white sausages) with sweet mustard and a soft pretzel.

https://reddit.com/link/1medwmd/video/l1nqr6ii5agf1/player

In the afternoon, if there‚Äôs time, visit **Nymphenburg Palace**. The gardens stretch for miles, and inside, the mirrored rooms feel like a Bavarian Versailles.

As the trip winds down, return to the city center. Make one last stop at **Caf√© Luitpold**, famous for pastries, and toast to a city that manages to be both traditional and forward-looking.

Hello


I moved in my beautiful apartment few months ago.
The renting market is terrible here in Ireland and I feel VERY lucky to get this one bedroom apartment at an affordable monthly rent. 


From day 1 I noticed that upstairs neighbours were particularly loud. 
I think they are a couple with a kid (I don‚Äôt know the age)


EVERYDAY it is stomping (not walking) with shoes, random items dropped, chair being dragged like the video. It is morning, afternoon, evening, night. Everyday
Skate board and ball play in the morning from,time to time.
We have wooden floor in all apartments


I reached a point where it was unbearable and I let them a polite note 2 weeks ago with a box of pads to stick under their chairs and suggested the use of slippers/socks/rugs
With the pads they could continue dragging their chairs and with slippers/ socks they could continue stomping/running/jumping and with the rugs they could continue being ¬´¬†clumsy¬†¬ª
I can hear them walk and stomp with sock and it is Ok,  but with the shoesüòµ


They ignored the note and the pads and they drag, stomp, drop item even louder and more often now‚Ä¶ 


I have never retaliated when they were noisy, believe me it is extremely difficult to resist because I am going to crack. 


Beginning of this week,  I threw my phone with rage on my coffee table and sent a complaint to my agency. The draft had been ready for days. 
I sent them video recordings but I am,afraid I did not catch the noise properly. 
I sent them my logs as well


Do you think I am overreacting?
My fear is that the agency tells me it is normal noise, it is during the day. 
I am going crazy of this accumulation of noises and repetition. 
Moving would be very difficult due to the market

Nespresso capsules,"Ik heb een Nespresso-apparaatje (originele, niet Vuerto) gekregen van iemand en ben een beetje aan het uitzoeken wat echt lekker is. 

Nu mag ik graag een lekkere espresso drinken, maar zelf thuis *goede* espresso's maken is een best dure en tijdrovende hobby waar ik niet aan wil beginnen (zelfs met het goedkoopste materiaal). Ik drink er ook gewoon niet genoeg van om het te rechtvaardigen en bonen snel genoeg op te maken.

Ik accepteer dus dat ik niet √©chte espresso's zal krijgen uit het apparaat. Ben verder ook geen r/espresso snob of zo, dus heb geen torenhoge eisen, maar ben wel benieuwd hoe ik er het beste uit kan halen!

Nu heb ik altijd een Dolce Gusto gehad en daar is weinig keuze op espressogebied. Bovendien is mijn ervaring dat de koffie naar driedubbel gecremeerde as smaakt. Nespresso-apparaten hebben een stuk meer keuze, gelukkig.

**Ik was daarom benieuwd of er mensen zijn die ervaring hebben met de wat meer niche (specialty coffee) capsules**. Ik zag bijvoorbeeld wat op orcoffee.nl en rumbaba.nl na wat zoeken. Dit lijken kleinere verkopers te zijn, die mogelijk wat hogere kwaliteit koffie verkopen...? Maar voordat ik tientallen van die cups ga zitten kopen, hoor ik graag wat anderen aan ervaring hebben.

Van Nespresso zelf heb ik nu de Ethiopia en Colombia capsules gekocht, omdat dat zo'n beetje de enige twee waren die James Hoffmann te pruimen vond in een video die ik vond (waarbij de rest verbrand of naar tarwe smaakte, of gewoon geen smaak had). Leek me een aardig begin en heb niet direct interesse om m√©√©r van Nespresso zelf te proberen.

It feels like the financial equivalent of kicking someone when they're down. ""Oh, you don't have enough money? Let's take MORE of your non-existent money!""

The math is insane too. A $35 fee on a $4.27 overdraft is like an 820% charge. If credit card companies tried charging that kind of interest, they'd be investigated for loan sharking.

And the best part? The bank processes the largest transactions first specifically so they can hit you with MULTIPLE overdraft fees on the smaller transactions that follow. My $4 coffee triggered a fee, but it was actually my rent payment that put me negative first.

How is this legal? It's literally a poverty tax. ""Oh you're poor? That'll be $35 please.""

Of course I started asking him about his idea, and it was exactly the present I couldn't use, and I hate it when time and money are wasted.

He didn't give me that present. He paid for some of my medicine and coffee that day, but we know each other for three years, so I didn't see it as a present for anniversary, just the act of kindness towards me. I asked if he wanted a massage completely not thinking about that 1 hour present, and I made it while the history video he found for us ended - 23 minutes, even with all this horrible feelings in my body. After that he was walking around acting weird, and I understood that he is extremely upset, several questions later he said: ""why shouldn't I, you promised 1 hour, and made 20 minutes, it makes me not believing your words"".

I have no proof to back up this manic episode I had in the middle of the night, but something just isn't adding up.

I have a friend who works in cybersecurity, and he would always mention how baby monitors can get hacked if you use the ones that connect to the wifi. Now I've known this guy my whole life, since he's been my best friend, so I'm not inclined to ever call him a liar. While he did recommend a few, we eventually put one on our baby shower wishlist.¬†

This baby monitor \*can\* connect to the wifi, but we have never done that, due to the safety concerns my friend had mentioned, even though it would be easier to connect to the app on my phone to view what the monitor sees, instead of always waiting for the monitor screen to turn on, which took I kid you not a full minute to power on. It even had excessive features like changing the color of the nightlight and playing calming sounds, which we rarely used since they never helped put her to sleep.

We have the camera plugged into the wall, but we always have to remember to turn the light switch on otherwise the camera won't work since that is how that outlet is set up, and we can't be bothered to move the camera to a different spot on the wall.

One afternoon I passed by our baby's bedroom and the camera's nightlight was on, glowing white. We never turned this on because we never needed to‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶why is it on? I didn't turn it on. Annoyed and confused, I grabbed the monitor, turned it on, waited a full minute for it to load, and sure enough the Nightlight icon was actively on. I go into the settings of the monitor to turn it off.

The Nightlight turns back on 3 seconds later.

I turn it off again.¬†

It turns on again.¬†

No‚Ä¶this is a glitch. It has to be. It doesn't make sense otherwise.¬†

Off.

On.

Off.

On.

No matter how many times I turn it off, it is persistent and fighting my command. So I turned off the light switch, powering down the camera since we didn't need it at the moment.¬†

Finally. It turned off.

But‚Ä¶I still had this creeping possibility lingering in the back of my head. Why?

I scoured the internet to see if anyone else had this problem with this particular model, but to no avail. Surely this has happened before‚Ä¶

That night, as I was laying in bed, I turned to my left to face the monitor and something caught my eye. It looked like dust particles flying across the corner of the screen. I've seen these before, it probably was a bug or dust or something like that. I turned off the monitor screen as I lay my head on the pillow to sleep.¬†

Honestly, I was just happy our kid was finally asleep since we've had some troubles putting her to sleep. We'd be up all night, taking shifts every hour in an attempt to drift her to snores at bedtime. So to see her, peaceful and still on the monitor, meant that we finally got to sleep before we had to go to work in a few hours. Good thing coffee exists.¬†

After a few minutes I then got up to use the bathroom and once I walked out of the bedroom, I immediately froze as I looked at our child's bedroom door that was slightly ajar spilling a crimson hue through the crack. The Nightlight was on in the middle of the night and it was glowing red.¬†

Fighting every possible urge to not scream in the middle of the pitch black night illuminated by one sole angry ray, I slowly creaked the door to enter only to hear the door do the screaming for me as it sounded like it was dying for its last breath as it scrapped at a snail's pace. Once the door was open just enough for me to squeeze through into the room, I got on my hands and knees as I crawled to the outlet. As I reached for the cord to unplug the camera in a desperately quiet attempt to fix the camera, I heard a rustling from the crib that nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked into the crib to see her just changing positions in her sleep, which was typical. Once I could tell she was sound asleep again, I unplugged the cord from the wall‚Ä¶waited a few seconds‚Ä¶then plugged it back in.¬†

The Nightlight was off.

‚Ä¶

And it stayed off.

I‚Äôm in month 2 of taking 10mg of Escitalopram. 
I‚Äôve been in regular therapy and not drinking coffee for the last 6 months.
& Since taking my antidepressants, I haven‚Äôt had any alcohol (I‚Äôve had a bit of weed here and there but it reacts fine with me).
If I continue all the above, plus regular exercise and healthy eating (which I do all the time anyway) what are the chances I can taper off the meds after 6 months ?

For further context, I‚Äôve not been on antidepressants before, a situation with my mum and dad spun me into despair a year ago but I have now cut them off - that is all to say my depression was caused by an event not its not an ongoing struggle ",0,1753996371.0,antidepressants,0,0.5,False

I got my freebies with it ‚Äî the promotional ones. Two bags of this Chimney Fire Coffee, a 1kg bag of Mont 58 coffee, and a coffee plant. I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the latter, but it looks cool.

Or if you ever will. But if something ever draws you here, if some part of you aches in my direction, I want you to know what it was. What it meant. What you meant.

You were the first place that ever felt like home. Not for what you gave me, but for what you were. I would‚Äôve lived any life as long as it was beside you. Any small, ordinary, wildly imperfect life as long as I got to see your shoulders soften, your eyes light up, your laugh echo through a kitchen that always smelled a little like coffee and late night warmth.

I used to imagine forever as a quiet rhythm with you. Waking up slow. Folding into the day without urgency. Your hand brushing past me as we moved around each other like we‚Äôd always done this. Grocery lists with inside jokes. Arguments that never turned cruel. Silence that never meant distance. The life we were building didn‚Äôt need to be loud. It just needed to be ours.

You once told me I made you feel like the world could stop spinning and it would be okay. That‚Äôs how you made me feel too. Like everything I was, everything I wasn‚Äôt, was enough. You didn‚Äôt have to try to be anything but real, and I loved you exactly as you were. Not the potential. Not the projection. You. In your quiet. In your fire. In your disappearing and reappearing and trying to find peace in a world that never gave it to you easily.

You gave me a reason to believe in more time. More mornings. More years. I anchored myself to the idea that I‚Äôd get to love you a little longer. That somehow, in all the noise of the world, we‚Äôd find each other over and over again.

That was my religion. You were the altar. And I prayed every single day.

Even now I hope you find whatever peace kept slipping through your fingers. And if you ever feel something stir, something ache in the places I used to touch, don‚Äôt mistake it for anything ordinary.  You are worth more than the silence you bury yourself in. And somewhere, in whatever place still lets you feel, I hope you remember this:

Some things aren‚Äôt meant to be replaced. Some loves don‚Äôt echo; they just stay.

You were so deeply loved.

And that love was real enough to last. Even if I didn‚Äôt. ",3,1753996271.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

I have no proof to back up this manic episode I had in the middle of the night, but something just isn't adding up.

I have a friend who works in cybersecurity, and he would always mention how baby monitors can get hacked if you use the ones that connect to the wifi. Now I've known this guy my whole life, since he's been my best friend, so I'm not inclined to ever call him a liar. While he did recommend a few, we eventually put one on our baby shower wishlist.¬†

This baby monitor \*can\* connect to the wifi, but we have never done that, due to the safety concerns my friend had mentioned, even though it would be easier to connect to the app on my phone to view what the monitor sees, instead of always waiting for the monitor screen to turn on, which took I kid you not a full minute to power on. It even had excessive features like changing the color of the nightlight and playing calming sounds, which we rarely used since they never helped put her to sleep.

We have the camera plugged into the wall, but we always have to remember to turn the light switch on otherwise the camera won't work since that is how that outlet is set up, and we can't be bothered to move the camera to a different spot on the wall.

One afternoon I passed by our baby's bedroom and the camera's nightlight was on, glowing white. We never turned this on because we never needed to‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶why is it on? I didn't turn it on. Annoyed and confused, I grabbed the monitor, turned it on, waited a full minute for it to load, and sure enough the Nightlight icon was actively on. I go into the settings of the monitor to turn it off.

The Nightlight turns back on 3 seconds later.

I turn it off again.¬†

It turns on again.¬†

No‚Ä¶this is a glitch. It has to be. It doesn't make sense otherwise.¬†

Off.

No matter how many times I turn it off, it is persistent and fighting my command. So I turned off the light switch, powering down the camera since we didn't need it at the moment.¬†

Finally. It turned off.

But‚Ä¶I still had this creeping possibility lingering in the back of my head. Why?

I scoured the internet to see if anyone else had this problem with this particular model, but to no avail. Surely this has happened before‚Ä¶

That night, as I was laying in bed, I turned to my left to face the monitor and something caught my eye. It looked like dust particles flying across the corner of the screen. I've seen these before, it probably was a bug or dust or something like that. I turned off the monitor screen as I lay my head on the pillow to sleep.¬†

Honestly, I was just happy our kid was finally asleep since we've had some troubles putting her to sleep. We'd be up all night, taking shifts every hour in an attempt to drift her to snores at bedtime. So to see her, peaceful and still on the monitor, meant that we finally got to sleep before we had to go to work in a few hours. Good thing coffee exists.¬†

After a few minutes I then got up to use the bathroom and once I walked out of the bedroom, I immediately froze as I looked at our child's bedroom door that was slightly ajar spilling a crimson hue through the crack. The Nightlight was on in the middle of the night and it was glowing red.¬†

Fighting every possible urge to not scream in the middle of the pitch black night illuminated by one sole angry ray, I slowly creaked the door to enter only to hear the door do the screaming for me as it sounded like it was dying for its last breath as it scrapped at a snail's pace. Once the door was open just enough for me to squeeze through into the room, I got on my hands and knees as I crawled to the outlet. As I reached for the cord to unplug the camera in a desperately quiet attempt to fix the camera, I heard a rustling from the crib that nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked into the crib to see her just changing positions in her sleep, which was typical. Once I could tell she was sound asleep again, I unplugged the cord from the wall‚Ä¶waited a few seconds‚Ä¶then plugged it back in.¬†

I want something that definitely has a fairly prominent spicy (cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or ginger/gingerbread) note, and is sweet but not overwhelmingly so. Maybe pumpkin, but it doesn't have to be. But, I've got this list of options I am struggling to narrow down. Does anyone have any recommendations for which of these I might like best? Or others I am not considering that I might like.

* Pumpkin Chai Tea
* Pumpkin Pie Spectacular
* Gingerbread Noel
* Homemade Holiday Eggnogg
* Honey Cinnamon Rolls
* Forever Winter
* November
* Venetian Waltz

If it's helpful here are some other CP scents I've tried and my thoughts:

* Cozy Blanket - love this one a lot, definitely my fav of theirs so far. I spray it on my bed almost daily.
* Shades of Gray - also love. Subtle but nice.
* The Un-Red - just got this but I like it a lot so far
* Boo Boo Lemon Noel - this smells good but I wouldn't rebuy because it's sooo sweet
* Anchor - initially smells too candle-y but I like it better after it dries
* Energy - I like this a lot. Really like the mint note
* Blackberry Lime Noel - this is nice. Not as overwhelmingly sweet as the lemon noel one
* Black Widow - this is just too hippie-ish smelling for me. I don't hate it but it's not how I want to smell. I would use it up anyway, but it gives my husband a headache so this is the only one of theirs I've tried that I got rid of.

Unrelated to my fall lotion options, I'd love any thoughts on these scents I'm interested in as well:

* Winchester House Kitchen
* Winter's Day
* Myrrh Coffee",3,1753996076.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I've seen these before, it probably was a bug or dust or something like that. I turned off the monitor screen as I lay my head on the pillow to sleep.¬†

Honestly, I was just happy our kid was finally asleep since we've had some troubles putting her to sleep. We'd be up all night, taking shifts every hour in an attempt to drift her to snores at bedtime. So to see her, peaceful and still on the monitor, meant that we finally got to sleep before we had to go to work in a few hours. Good thing coffee exists.¬†

After a few minutes I then got up to use the bathroom and once I walked out of the bedroom, I immediately froze as I looked at our child's bedroom door that was slightly ajar spilling a crimson hue through the crack. The Nightlight was on in the middle of the night and it was glowing red.¬†

Fighting every possible urge to not scream in the middle of the pitch black night illuminated by one sole angry ray, I slowly creaked the door to enter only to hear the door do the screaming for me as it sounded like it was dying for its last breath as it scrapped at a snail's pace. Once the door was open just enough for me to squeeze through into the room, I got on my hands and knees as I crawled to the outlet. As I reached for the cord to unplug the camera in a desperately quiet attempt to fix the camera, I heard a rustling from the crib that nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked into the crib to see her just changing positions in her sleep, which was typical. Once I could tell she was sound asleep again, I unplugged the cord from the wall‚Ä¶waited a few seconds‚Ä¶then plugged it back in.¬†

The Nightlight was off.

‚Ä¶

And it stayed off.

After a silent sigh of relief, I crawled out of the room, stood up, and went to the bathroom. Once I finished I entered my bedroom, shut my door, and walked over to my bed. As I laid down once again, legs in blanket, head on pillow, blanket over chest, I turned to my left again and remembered I had turned off the screen. I then realized I forgot to check that Nightlight icon on the screen earlier. Was it there? I was so tired I honestly don't remember. If the light was on then the icon was on, so it must have been.¬†

The Optimum Nutrition Daily Multivitamin Pack is an essential supplement for those striving for optimal health and wellness.

1medchr,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1medchr/my_babys_nightlight_keeps_turning_on/,My Baby's Nightlight Keeps Turning On,"Have you ever had that paranoid feeling that someone has been watching even when they aren't there? I have no proof to back up this manic episode I had in the middle of the night, but something just isn't adding up.

I have a friend who works in cybersecurity, and he would always mention how baby monitors can get hacked if you use the ones that connect to the wifi. Now I've known this guy my whole life, since he's been my best friend, so I'm not inclined to ever call him a liar. While he did recommend a few, we eventually put one on our baby shower wishlist.¬†

This baby monitor \*can\* connect to the wifi, but we have never done that, due to the safety concerns my friend had mentioned, even though it would be easier to connect to the app on my phone to view what the monitor sees, instead of always waiting for the monitor screen to turn on, which took I kid you not a full minute to power on. It even had excessive features like changing the color of the nightlight and playing calming sounds, which we rarely used since they never helped put her to sleep.

We have the camera plugged into the wall, but we always have to remember to turn the light switch on otherwise the camera won't work since that is how that outlet is set up, and we can't be bothered to move the camera to a different spot on the wall.

One afternoon I passed by our baby's bedroom and the camera's nightlight was on, glowing white. We never turned this on because we never needed to‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶why is it on? I didn't turn it on. Annoyed and confused, I grabbed the monitor, turned it on, waited a full minute for it to load, and sure enough the Nightlight icon was actively on. I go into the settings of the monitor to turn it off.

The Nightlight turns back on 3 seconds later.

I turn it off again.¬†

It turns on again.¬†

No‚Ä¶this is a glitch. It has to be. It doesn't make sense otherwise.¬†

Off.

On.

Off.

On.

No matter how many times I turn it off, it is persistent and fighting my command. So I turned off the light switch, powering down the camera since we didn't need it at the moment.¬†

Finally. It turned off.

But‚Ä¶I still had this creeping possibility lingering in the back of my head. Why?

I scoured the internet to see if anyone else had this problem with this particular model, but to no avail. Surely this has happened before‚Ä¶

That night, as I was laying in bed, I turned to my left to face the monitor and something caught my eye. It looked like dust particles flying across the corner of the screen. I've seen these before, it probably was a bug or dust or something like that. I turned off the monitor screen as I lay my head on the pillow to sleep.¬†

Honestly, I was just happy our kid was finally asleep since we've had some troubles putting her to sleep. We'd be up all night, taking shifts every hour in an attempt to drift her to snores at bedtime. So to see her, peaceful and still on the monitor, meant that we finally got to sleep before we had to go to work in a few hours. Good thing coffee exists.¬†

After a few minutes I then got up to use the bathroom and once I walked out of the bedroom, I immediately froze as I looked at our child's bedroom door that was slightly ajar spilling a crimson hue through the crack. The Nightlight was on in the middle of the night and it was glowing red.¬†

Fighting every possible urge to not scream in the middle of the pitch black night illuminated by one sole angry ray, I slowly creaked the door to enter only to hear the door do the screaming for me as it sounded like it was dying for its last breath as it scrapped at a snail's pace. Once the door was open just enough for me to squeeze through into the room, I got on my hands and knees as I crawled to the outlet. As I reached for the cord to unplug the camera in a desperately quiet attempt to fix the camera, I heard a rustling from the crib that nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked into the crib to see her just changing positions in her sleep, which was typical. Once I could tell she was sound asleep again, I unplugged the cord from the wall‚Ä¶waited a few seconds‚Ä¶then plugged it back in.¬†

The Nightlight was off.

1medc76,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1medc76/cat_helpeyes/,Cat help/eyes,"Hello üëã So my cat started squinting her left eye about three weeks ago, I took her to her vet and they could not find anything wrong with her eye, no ulcers or anything like that. They prescribed her a neomycin ointment to put on her eye after two days of watching her, if she was still showing symptoms, so on that Friday I started giving her the ointment. The ointment seemed to make it worse. She couldn't open her eye for very long with the ointment, and she had rubbed it raw. I took her back to the vet after a few days of using it, because it was not helping or making anything better and she was hiding under my coffee table. I was told to stop using the ointment and to watch her and call the following Monday after about another week, so I did. She had started squinting her right eye, but her left seemed better. I had been struggling to get rid of fruit flies and some gnats on my kitchen after buying bananas, so we were trying to figure out if they might be the cause, but her eyes still looked perfectly fine and healthy. Another vet examined her eyes but still couldn't find anything, but gave her a de-wormer because some fruit flies can carry parasites although it's not very common where I live, in Montana. Now up until this week, her squinting seems to be getting worse. She is squinting both eyes now, but she has stopped hiding as much, she does seem to be a little more irratable and she is scratching her chin and neck, and rubbing her eyes, shaking her head and cleaning herself more than usual. Also she is really liking my bathroom floor mat. Her eyes still look normal, she is playing and eating and drinking and using the litter box just fine. Accept I have noticed a dark squiggle along the iris of her eye that I've never really noticed before, and it kind of shows up and then disappears. She done appear to be a little sensitive to light. Could it be allergies? After calling the vet again yesterday, I was left a voice message saying that they have run out of options to give me, and that the best they could do was give me a referral to a specialist in Spokane Washington. I dont know if i am going to be able to get up there. I am planning to call her vet again for more information about the specialist today. Any help and information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! She is turning 5 I'm August, she is an English short-hair and a calico, I have never had any problems with allergies before with her but I have only had her for a year.

I'm from the town Dutch Bros started in, and I used to work there 20 years ago, when it was a much simpler, different company. 

 My wife and I are struggling to make our mortgage payments, and we have a third kid on the way, and realized that I needed to quit the part-time job I was working from home and go out and get another part-time job that paid better.

 I wish I didn't feel so old and slow. The pace that we are required to move at feels almost impossible for me. Our drive-thru line is almost always full, and the customers are demanding, and often show up looking for TikTok drink creations that they want made picture perfect.

 Don't get me wrong, I love working in coffee, but I've hit an age where I can't really even have caffeine anymore, I have to limit my sugar, most of my co-workers weren't even alive last time I worked at Dutch Bros, and I just feel ancient and ashamed that I haven't gotten a career started before now.
 
 I'm proud that I'm a present Dad, and I have usually been the one home with my kids. I do 90% of the diaper changes and 100% of the night time wake ups, but working this job is just slowly eroding my self-esteem. I'm worried that it moves at a pace that I just can't keep up with, and I don't want to be fired from it.

1medapl,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalintelligence/comments/1medapl/avoidants_in_ltrmarriages_what_does_your/,Avoidants in LTR/marriages: what does your relationship look like?,"First time posting here, and not sure this is the best sub, but I read plenty of nice discussions on here so I thought I might give it a try!

I am a woman who, thanks to childhood trauma, developed a disorganized attachment, which shows in romantic relationships, but also in friendships and family dynamics. I am in therapy because of this. Last year I dated an avoidant guy for little over 8 months. The relationship ended because he deactivated pretty badly, by simply, I think, me being a more or less sustained presence in his life for more than just 3-4 months. I let him run because, ultimately, that‚Äôs his battle to fight, if he‚Äôll ever want to. It was also the kindest and honest thing to do. This being said, this relationship made me think quite a bit, because‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt all that bad? Like, I liked the frequency with which we saw each other (1 x week), I liked the chill vibe and I liked that I have a very very busy life, can come up with a new hobby every weekend, and once we would meet, we would spend the first hour sharing what had happened to us, what we did, and so on. With mutual interest and listening. Also, I always appreciated his gestures of affection (a hot cup of coffee in the morning or a glass of water on the nightstand before going to bed), dunno, I saw so much sweetness in those small things. After that experience I was left wondering what is it that I want in a relationship (currently not interested in dating again but if that interest ever comes back I want to have answers to my questions). Do I want a relationship where there is more breathing space and where I am free to explore all my interests, and then share many stories with my partner once I see them?
So my question here is: avoidants who end up reading this post, and made it to LTR and or marriage, what are your relationships looking like, on a daily basis, in terms of space, communication, intimacy?

TL;DR: avoidant people who are in LTR and or marriage, what is your relationship like with your SO on a daily basis?",3,1753995492.0,emotionalintelligence,2,1.0,False

Now I've known this guy my whole life, since he's been my best friend, so I'm not inclined to ever call him a liar. While he did recommend a few, we eventually put one on our baby shower wishlist.¬†

This baby monitor \*can\* connect to the wifi, but we have never done that, due to the safety concerns my friend had mentioned, even though it would be easier to connect to the app on my phone to view what the monitor sees, instead of always waiting for the monitor screen to turn on, which took I kid you not a full minute to power on. It even had excessive features like changing the color of the nightlight and playing calming sounds, which we rarely used since they never helped put her to sleep.

We have the camera plugged into the wall, but we always have to remember to turn the light switch on otherwise the camera won't work since that is how that outlet is set up, and we can't be bothered to move the camera to a different spot on the wall.

One afternoon I passed by our baby's bedroom and the camera's nightlight was on, glowing white. We never turned this on because we never needed to‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶why is it on? I didn't turn it on. Annoyed and confused, I grabbed the monitor, turned it on, waited a full minute for it to load, and sure enough the Nightlight icon was actively on. I go into the settings of the monitor to turn it off.

The Nightlight turns back on 3 seconds later.

I turn it off again.¬†

It turns on again.¬†

No‚Ä¶this is a glitch. It has to be. It doesn't make sense otherwise.¬†

Off.

On.

Off.

On.

No matter how many times I turn it off, it is persistent and fighting my command. So I turned off the light switch, powering down the camera since we didn't need it at the moment.¬†

Finally. It turned off.

But‚Ä¶I still had this creeping possibility lingering in the back of my head. Why?

I scoured the internet to see if anyone else had this problem with this particular model, but to no avail. Surely this has happened before‚Ä¶

That night, as I was laying in bed, I turned to my left to face the monitor and something caught my eye. It looked like dust particles flying across the corner of the screen. I've seen these before, it probably was a bug or dust or something like that. I turned off the monitor screen as I lay my head on the pillow to sleep.¬†

Honestly, I was just happy our kid was finally asleep since we've had some troubles putting her to sleep. We'd be up all night, taking shifts every hour in an attempt to drift her to snores at bedtime. So to see her, peaceful and still on the monitor, meant that we finally got to sleep before we had to go to work in a few hours. Good thing coffee exists.¬†

After a few minutes I then got up to use the bathroom and once I walked out of the bedroom, I immediately froze as I looked at our child's bedroom door that was slightly ajar spilling a crimson hue through the crack. The Nightlight was on in the middle of the night and it was glowing red.¬†

Fighting every possible urge to not scream in the middle of the pitch black night illuminated by one sole angry ray, I slowly creaked the door to enter only to hear the door do the screaming for me as it sounded like it was dying for its last breath as it scrapped at a snail's pace. Once the door was open just enough for me to squeeze through into the room, I got on my hands and knees as I crawled to the outlet. As I reached for the cord to unplug the camera in a desperately quiet attempt to fix the camera, I heard a rustling from the crib that nearly made me jump out of my skin. I looked into the crib to see her just changing positions in her sleep, which was typical. Once I could tell she was sound asleep again, I unplugged the cord from the wall‚Ä¶waited a few seconds‚Ä¶then plugged it back in.¬†

The Nightlight was off.

‚Ä¶

And it stayed off.

After a silent sigh of relief, I crawled out of the room, stood up, and went to the bathroom. Once I finished I entered my bedroom, shut my door, and walked over to my bed. As I laid down once again, legs in blanket, head on pillow, blanket over chest, I turned to my left again and remembered I had turned off the screen. I then realized I forgot to check that Nightlight icon on the screen earlier. Was it there? I was so tired I honestly don't remember. If the light was on then the icon was on, so it must have been.¬†

I pressed the button one last time.

I waited for a minute as I counted the passing seconds‚Ä¶

1med86f,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1med86f/8day_ring_road_july_itinerary_budget_and_review/,"8-Day Ring Road July Itinerary, Budget, and Review","Hi all,  

I've just returned from an 8-day trip around Iceland and thought I would post our final itinerary and thoughts. While I was initially worried about being rushed in 8 days, we found the trip to be very manageable. We had to pick and choose our stops, but enjoyed the flexibility of campervan travel. Here was our itinerary...

  
**Day 1**

\-Land at KEF and pick up camper van from Rent.is We got a Renault Traffic 3, which was basic but perfect for two people.

\- Grab some groceries at Costco and Bonus

\- Head to Thingvellir National Park for a walk 

\- Check in to Reykjam√∂rk Hverager√∞i Campsite early to battle some jet lag

\- Dinner at √ñlverk Pizza & Brewery

  
**Day 2** 

\- Started our trip around ring road (counter-clockwise) with stops at Seljalandsfoss, Sk√≥gafoss, Dyrh√≥laey, and Reynisfjara Beach. 

\- Lunch at Soup Company in Vik, Crepes from Crepe.is

\- Beautiful drive to Skaftfell Camping

\- Dinner at the campsite and evening hike to Hundafoss

  
**Day 3** 

**-** Glacier hike through Local Guides (4-hour glacier discovery).

\- Fjalls√°rl√≥n and Diamond Beach

\- Head to Camping Hofn before dinner at Pakkhus (10/10)

  
**Day 4**

\- East Fjord drive and coffee in Dj√∫pivogur

\- Roadside lunch at Nykurhylsfoss

\- Vok Baths 

\- Camping at Skipal√¶kur tjaldsv√¶√∞i

**Day 5** 

**-** Stu√∞lagil Canyon

\- N√°mafjall Hverir Viewpoint and Hverfjall Volcano Trail

\- Husavik for Whale Museum, drinks at Jaja Ding Dong, dinner at Nausti√∞

\- Camping and free whale watching from the back of the camper at Camping 66.12 NORTH

**Day 6** 

**-** Coffee in Husavik, Lunch in Akuyeri

\- Koluglj√∫fur Canyon

\- Hvammstangi Campground

\- Local D2 soccer game

\- Drinks at Hladan Kaffihus

  
**Day 7** 

\- Grabok Crater

\- Hvammsvik Hot Springs

\- Camping Akranes tjaldsv√¶√∞i

\- Sunset beach walk/Pony appreciation

  
**Day 8** 

\- Reykjav√≠k for some shopping and walking around

\- Brunch at Sandholt

\- Fagradalsfjall Volcano hike (busy but totally worth it)

\- Dinner/Drying off at Papa's Restaurant

\- Camping at Grindav√≠k Campsite

**Day 9**

\-  return camper van, get to KEF for early flight



**Rough Budget**

The insane cost of visiting Iceland is real. We were constantly blown away by the cost of things at every turn. 1040 ISK parking at most spots around ring road also adds up over 8 days.  We splurged in some areas, especially getting meals out, which we would have cut back if we were tighter on our budget. Here is a super rough budget in Canadian dollars.

\- Camper Van $3500

\- Hotsprings and glacier hike $1000

\- Camping, parking, and gas $1300

\- Food and meals out $1500

\- SIM cards and shopping $200

**Final thoughts**

Iceland overall totally lived up to our expectations. The drive around the island was stunning, and photos truly don't do justice to the expansive beauty this country offers. We were happy to get on the road quickly and get away from the larger crowds that we experienced closer to Reykjavik. Overall, driving was easy, and the country does a good job of providing ample parking at all of the major sites. We found more European travellers while driving the ring road, but recognised more American/Canadian closer to and in Reykjavik. Our favourite stretch of the trip was probably days 3 - 7.

If you are travelling a significant distance (Western Canada for us), give yourself some flexibility for the first two days. We were caught pretty badly with jet lag and had to cut a couple of stops on our first two days. 

Camping was easy, and not having to book ahead made it easy to maintain a flexible schedule. All of our campsites were good; however, Camping 66.12 North and Akranes tjaldsv√¶√∞i were our favourites. Eye masks were necessary for sleeping with the late sun. 

Spots that exceeded our expectations were the Glacier Hike, Husavik, Pakkhus restaurant, Stu√∞lagil Canyon, and Hvammsvik Hot Springs.

Overall, Iceland was amazing and made for a perfect short holiday. We would love to return one day to do more Golden Circle stops, Sn√¶fellsnes Peninsula, and West Fjords. 

Please let me know if you have any questions about our trip and itinerary. This sub was amazing for planning our trip, and I am happy to return to favour for anyone who wants it. 

Skol!

1med71g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1med71g/does_the_presto_02811_coffee_maker_deliver_rich/,Does the Presto 02811 Coffee Maker Deliver Rich Flavor and Elegance?,"The Presto 02811 coffee maker became part of my morning ritual after a mad dash through my kitchen gadgets left me realizing I was long overdue for a reliable percolator upgrade. With its sleek stainless steel design and traditional styling that screams vintage charm, it promised to brew coffee as comforting as the Sunday mornings it invokes. Oh, and it wasn‚Äôt just about how it looked ‚Äî this thing had features to back up its classy fa√ßade. While I couldn‚Äôt resist the appeal of brewing up to twelve cups of coffee in one shot, I dove in to see if it truly delivered.

**Ease of Brewing and Automatic Operation**  
Right off the bat, using this percolator felt straightforward. Fully automatic operation means there‚Äôs no need to fumble with settings or buttons before your first cup. I simply loaded the freshly ground beans into the reusable stainless steel filter basket, added water, and plugged it in. It started brewing almost instantly. The cup-a-minute speed was impressive; by the time I prepped my toast, there were already rich coffee aromas wafting through my kitchen. The signal light was another small yet helpful addition, indicating when the coffee was ready to serve.

   [Check Presto 02811 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b00df5honi/)  

**Classic Design Meets Durability**  
One of my favorite aspects is the traditional, hotel-style design ‚Äî it genuinely feels like a nod to old-school coffee culture. The shiny stainless steel construction not only looks elegant but is easy to clean and retains its timeless appeal over many uses (and trust me, I‚Äôve been rough). Every component made of steel, including the filter basket and perk tube, elevates the quality compared to other percolators with plastic parts. It felt substantial in hand yet surprisingly lightweight for a coffee maker. Storage was also hassle-free, as the cord is detachable, ensuring I could tuck it into tighter spaces when not in use.

**The Coffee Quality: Taste Worth Raving About**  
The coffee? Bold, smooth, and piping hot (but not scalding!). After experimenting with different grounds, I noticed the flavor extraction was consistent. Regardless of medium or fine grinds, it delivered cups that matched caf√®-quality brews without the bitterness I‚Äôve experienced with drip coffee makers. Plus, it kept the coffee warm throughout the morning, making it perfect for a household where everyone rushes in at different times.

**Highlights**  
- Sturdy stainless steel design elevates durability and easy cleaning.  
- Brews coffee rapidly at a cup-a-minute pace.  
- Indicator light helps simplify use by letting you know when brewing is complete.  
- Keeps coffee hot automatically without compromising flavor or freshness.  

**Pitfalls**  
Of course, no product is flawless. As much as I loved the Presto 02811, it did have its quirks.  
- It runs on the louder side during the brewing process. If you‚Äôre seeking peace and quiet during your early mornings, this might catch you off guard.  
- Although the interior components clean up effortlessly, the polished exterior can be prone to showing fingerprints. A microfiber cloth nearby is a must if you‚Äôre particular about appearances.  
- It lacks an option to choose brew strength, so you‚Äôll need to experiment with the coffee-to-water ratio to get your preferred taste.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this with other percolators, such as the Cuisinart PRC-12, was necessary to see its real value. While both can brew up to twelve cups, the Presto edges ahead in overall durability as it has a fully stainless-steel filter. Cuisinart‚Äôs percolator, on the other hand, performs slightly quieter and has a sleeker modern look that some might prefer. Other challengers, like Hamilton Beach‚Äôs coffee percolator, offer a similar brewing speed but fall short in terms of aesthetics and build quality. Where the Presto excels is in being a true kitchen statement piece, with added emphasis on traditional charm and reliability.

**Smart Spending**  
For its features, like brewing speed, automatic warming, and meticulous finish, the Presto 02811 hits the right marks when considering its price-to-quality ratio. While some coffee aficionados might find its lack of advanced brew customizations limiting, the sheer consistency in coffee flavor and durability more than make up for it. It‚Äôs not uncommon to find coffee makers with all the bells and whistles but lacking longevity. What you‚Äôre investing in here is something built to last, while still elevating your coffee routine ‚Äî something every caffeine-driven day deserves.

1med69c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthMomentum/comments/1med69c/does_rosabella_moringa_capsule_re1_provide_the/,Does Rosabella Moringa Capsule RE-1 Provide the Best Natural Energy Boost? Review Here!,"The Rosabella RE-1 Moringa Capsules have been a daily addition to my routine for several weeks now. Before diving into my personal experience, let me set the scene: this natural supplement is composed of pure Moringa oleifera, a highly regarded superfood. Sourced from the horseradish tree, these capsules are designed to boost energy, enhance immune support, and promote gut health‚Äîall while being packed with 46 antioxidants, 27 vitamins, and nine amino acids. The brand promises a natural, plant-based pick-me-up to replace traditional caffeine, so I thought, why not give it a go?

**Design and Practicality**  
The minimalist packaging is both compact and sturdy. With dimensions of 4 x 2 x 2 inches, the bottle easily fits into a travel bag or your kitchen pantry without taking up too much space. As someone who travels frequently for work, I appreciated the no-fuss design. The capsules themselves are of a standard size, vegan, and easy to swallow. I found the unflavored nature of the pills ensured there was no weird aftertaste‚Äîa massive plus since some supplements can linger unpleasantly.  

**Highlights**  
- Packed with 27 vitamins and 9 essential amino acids.  
- Contains 46 antioxidants to promote overall wellness.  
- Each serving (2 capsules) provides 800mg of moringa powder, covering daily energy, skin, and gut balance needs.  

[Check Rosabella RE-1 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b0d52nmwft/)  

**Performance**  
From the first few days of using this supplement, I noticed a subtle yet consistent boost in energy levels, particularly in the mornings where caffeine used to be my go-to. There‚Äôs a noticeable absence of the crash that usually trails my mid-afternoon coffee habit. While I wouldn‚Äôt call the energy levels ""explosive,"" the capsules do provide a steady, balanced sense of vitality. My workouts felt more productive‚Äîpotentially due to the nine amino acids working their magic‚Äîand recovery time felt slightly shorter than usual.  

Skin health also showed marginal improvements over a three-week span. The antioxidants and vitamins seemed to help with maintaining a natural glow, which coworkers actually commented on. However, I can‚Äôt conclusively beat my chest too hard on this since I‚Äôve also been doubling down on hydration‚Äîbut it feels safe to say these capsules played a part.  

**Good Points**  
- Natural energy boost without relying on caffeine or coffee.  
- Excellent for those seeking a holistic, plant-based source of vitamin A, calcium, and iron.  
- Easy to incorporate into daily wellness routines due to its lightweight and travel-friendly packaging.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The lack of immediate effects: Do not expect overnight miracles. It requires consistent use to start noticing changes.  
- At times, I experienced slight bloating in the first week, likely because my body was adjusting to the supplement.  

**Competitors**  
When compared with other Moringa supplements in the market, the competition is tough. Products like Organic India's Moringa Capsules or Kuli Kuli‚Äôs Moringa Powder are also widely loved options. However, Rosabella‚Äôs RE-1 capsules stand out for their clean composition and absence of fillers or synthetic additives, which gives it an upper hand in terms of purity. By contrast, some competitors include binders or extra additives that can dilute the product's effectiveness. That said, Rosabella is a bit pricier than a few of its counterparts, which is something to weigh in depending on your budget.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
While prices for supplements are all over the place, I found the quality more than justified the cost for Rosabella‚Äôs moringa capsules. The third-party testing for quality alone gave me additional peace of mind. Considering key features like the ethical sourcing, vegan-friendly formula, and sheer nutritional density, the investment seems to deliver tangible benefits at a fair value.

\*\*another edit - I think alanon is a great program, I do not judge those who are in it. I literally have reccommend people I know to go to Alanon. However, the reason  I brought up my feelings about alanon is because I was talking about my background and feelings and trying to express hey its hard for me to post here because xyz. My mother is 30 years sober, worked alanon the entire time, and she is still a codependent, abusive and toxic. Thats just her though. But I truly believe it is not the end all be all. I know myself and I have come so far in my life. Even enduring everything I am right now, wow am I celebrating my wins. I wouldnt have been able to put down boundaries or leave 2 years ago. I have been living a life that I imagined 2 years ago. I am so proud of myself and I am struggling yeah but I am making good decisions, keeping a clear head. I don't think things are black and white. I personally plan on continuing mental health care with a Psychologist and my Pscyhiatrist, doing codependency / cPTSD workbooks, reading about alchoholic family systems, and keep doing the work. And then I thought I could come here for support. But it upsets me that the first comments on my post, aftr I literally poured my heart out asking for support, advice, and inspiratino about my situation... the comments are literally just about alanon the program. The one comment ""When you are desperate enough we will be here"" that is a shitty thing to say. Honestly, and solidifies what I don't like about it. Its like a cult. Nothing is black and white, life is a grey area and everyone has a different path to healing. I didn't post this to be pressured to go into a meeting I made that clear and why too. I did come here though, seeking advice and support, and I am taking help from the program. No need to get defensive and say things lik ethat to me. I think alanon is such a great resource and a lifeline for many. I firmly know that I am capable of healing, recovering, learning and moving forward my own way, and it doesnt require alanon. Alanon has changed your life and I am so happy for you. But that doesn't mean thats the only path for everyone else. Priniciples before personalities?

  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

He has tried to stay sober. He has gone a week here and there. And those were the best times. He got arrested two months ago and itwas like the wake up call I was praying for. He was so clear, calm and just said all these epiphanies and just it was so relief for me. He truly wanted to stay sober and never wanted to drink, but also just realized to a deeper level his behavior, dynamics of his family and inner wounds.

We had been talking about this stuff alot the past 6 months before he got arreswted as I am on my own healing journey. We both made huge strides and progress, he put down boundaries on an abusive family member, he was getting ahead, we both made improvements with our communication, we really did move forward and ive been proud of him. And me, We are so farther ahead in life and has accomplished so many goals. And have mad sooo many memories together. I started doing more hobbies with him, new hobbies, we camp al the time now. but I knew it would only go so far if he kept drinking.

He truly has been there for me and done so much for me. And made me feel so seen, heard and not judged. I never felt like I truly had loved someone before and been so loved. He wanted to stop drinking, he would last a week here and there a couple days. I found out later that he had been hospitalized twice for drinking. This scared me. He never told me. But then it always came down to ""I dont want to quit completely, just a few  beers, everyone else gets to drink"" and no matter how much i exlplained it until I was blue in the face, he was jus in denial- sick. He would go from clarity to denial. But we faced hardships in life, I had someone try to break in and get me. and more. His drinking got worse. He got arrested.

Then after jail its like was his come to jesus. He just was so done with it. I really believed him. He felt better. But he never went to an AA meeting or even googled support or even reddit stop drinking group. He didn't get a therapist. He kept procrastinating. We were working on moving though so I kind of understood why? but, He stayed sober. We had a really wonderful month /12..  But he made some comments about wanting to drink a beer. like jokes. I knew it was coming. On 4th of july it was hard for him as we were stressed about housing, traveling looking at places and in a town where everyone was drinking and free booze was everywhere. He ordered a beer and then sent it back. I was upset . Codependent. I told him he needed support but he didn't seek help. Just whie knuckling it. But i just was in denial. I have never been so deeply in love or just had a best friend like this. I have more fun with him than I do anyone. And things felt so different. I told him how great it was, how happy I was. We both talked about how grateful we were that he got arrested. He said that himself. I just love him. I have never met someone so compatible. I truly love him so much, like so many aspects of him. Truly I was convinced we would marry and I was ready.

I also am on a healing journey, recently went no contact with my parents. I have severe PTSD from SA and DV in my early 20s, and I thought I had bipolar disorder. Well this year with the help of my own healing work , spiritual practice, and honestly the support of my partner I had realized with the help of my team that I do not have bipolar, it has been cPTSD from child abuse. I really did credit my partner because being with him it made me analyze my own family system, and also he made me feel so understood and seen and not judged. My life improved in a way. Until his drinking got so much worse. But he has been there for me supporting on this nad Ive told him things about my childhood I thought Id take to the grave, things I thought noone would love me if they knew. Thats why this is so hard because he really helped me. I did all the work of course and got help from the professionals. But he was so supportive. nd I also had been making the mistake of being super heavy and talking about this stuff alot and I realized how it did impact him. I have had a really hard life and horrific things have happened to me. This really impacts him, hes very empathetic and he deeply feels pain when he hears about whawt Ive been through. I credit that it was hard for him . He also saw me panic with PTSD after the intruder and one night i packed bags in a panick, convinced him to get up out of bed by telling him my ex is coming to kill us (I had just talked to DV services who stupidly tiold me they think the intruder watching me was premeditated which caused me to panic). Told him we might get shot, made him pack his bags, told him I was leaving him and fleeing out of state and paid for a motel room for us to stay the night. He takes things at face value and truly believed I was leaving out of state , he woud have to find roommates and he also was just so scared for me.We went to get a motel, then decided to go back home. Then i got scared again and I made him get up. We checked in at 3am.  Later on in the motel room he told me how he is happy we got a motel if it made me feel more safe, and that seeing me like that made him truly understand PTSD more and that he is there for me. He was so understanding. I am in fault too. Which makes this so much harder.

I also am well aware about alanon, codepency , and alchoholics, I will say my mom is sober 30 years, I get it that its pretty predictable why I am in this situation and how codependent I am given my ""alchohlic family system"" and honestly it annoys the fuck out of me. To be honest, I am annoyed I am even seeking help from alanon. I pretty much grew up in AA. My mother got sober right before she got pregnant with me. She is super AA lady, huge speaker meeting, ive been to countless meetins seeing her or her brother take chips, all her friends are sober, she hosts a monthly pot luck. Two meetings a week. AA picnics, daycare, events. Chips. The smell of coffee and cigarettes remind me of my childhood I can recite the steps and the prayer. Thats why I feel so stupid I am in this situation.But the thing is she is so extremely abusive, narcissistic, adn so is my father. Literally I am 31 and she still is so terrible to me. And is emotionally immature and afraid to connect with me. It blows my mind she can devote her entire 30 years of life to recovery with weekly meetings, etc and still be the most toxic person. She is sick. Thats why I am also hesitant towards alanon and aa because I do not think it can replace true mental health care and often even therapists get it wrong. AA is such a huge part of her ego and martyer mentality. She loves the narrative that I am the poor sad bipolar daughter and she is the poor mother. When really, she abuses me and it deeply impacted me. The way she is with me or behind closed doors that her friends would be shocked. She sometimes even talks like a baby voice and says lies and I will call her out on it and she will act dumb its truly disturbing., She has cornerd me walking me into a wall and not moving her body, as if shes trying to fight me and then when I try to move away she will cower as if I am going to hit her and I don't . Shes locked me in a bathroom and so much of her identity is being worried about my bipolar ness while meanwhile abusing me and being terrible to me. And then for everyone in AA Alanon shes the shining example of sobriety. So I really fought coming here. Also I don't have a problem and I dont drink very often but if I even have a toast or wine with family at events she looks at me scathingly, makes comments. She is so harshly judgemental and critical. I drove 12 hours to go see her and have her meet my partner I come in at 7pm at night, super out of it from the drive especially in 80 degree heat and she looks at me nasty and goes ""are you drunk?""... as if I would get drunk and drive that far and bring my boyfriend to meet my parents - drunk. She just thinks the worst of me. And every single time i had a problem, a stress, a worry, she told me to go to alanon. When really I needed a psychologist which I found myself and shes the one who helped me understand how toxic my parents behavior is. My psychiatrist is the one who suggested it was child abuse and he has a Phd MD and more. I have since gone no contact with my parents and they have told the whole family that I am in a manic epsiode and deeply sick and I recieve nasty hateful messages and now I am shunned with no family. Its wild. Yet noone has called me to talk to me to see why I have gone no contact, they told me they don't believe I was abused. My mom told them that I said my dad sexually abused me which she doesnt believe, and noone believes the physical vioelnce done to my brother even though she knows it happens - she allowed it. And was part of it. But yeah long story short I have no family. My partner is my family. So this is why this is so extremely difficult for me. And also probably all of this is why he started drinking so much more (not blaming myself) but I know he is upset for me, hes angry at my parents, and its heavy stuff,

Well the month of sobriety has gone great. Our communication has been great and hes been doing the things I was hoping. He has been so positive, telling me ""Have faith we can do this!"" which is what I usaklly do. We are moving, and he got a job on a commercial fishing boat. Hes done it before but this is week long stays. Super meaningful for him - he was so happy proud of himself. I helped hijm find the job. He mentioned how he was grateful to be sober and so grateful for me . We made plans. But he never took it upon himself to go to therapy, google anything, go to AA, or even reddit support group . This worried me. Then before he left i saw it in his eyes, he was struggling and distant. So proud and excited, but nervous. But most of all he felt guilty he was leaving to the boat and I would have to move all of our stuff out ofour 3bedroom house myself and handle the backyard. Also, we had someone watching me adn try to come in and get me a two months ago, and I have PTSD, so he knows how unsafe I feel in the home. Our neighborhood is bad and we already felt sketched out. He is worried about me being alone, he feels bad I have to do it myself, he knows how unsafe I feel and how I am struggling with saftey and worrying its my past stalker. And hes kept saying that he is scared that if something happened he couldnt get to me,

The irony is, these worries he has about eme, I have to reassure him. I have to comfort him. Hes also comforted me and told me to take care of myself, do what I need to do for me. He is also paying for it all and I assured him that I am happy to handle it all. He facetimed me in the middle of the trip and I could tell he was struggling. Also, he is working from 5am to 10pm doing gnarly manual labor at sea 200 miles out, its one of the most hardest and dangerous jobs so hes exhausted although he loves it. But I started to get nervous. He went to port, and started drinking again. The port he is at is surrounde dby fishermen, bars, and his crew goes and gets beers. I wasnt suprised. And for the past 3 days he has called me and just terrorized me. We will haev good convos, but then later in the day he just will be sooo mean, and if I bring up that so your drinking again? he becomes so pissed off and yells at me as if we hadnt gone through what we just did. Saying hes his own man, and he can drink sometimes, it wont be like how it was. I am afraid hes going to lse his job or his disease will convince him to sneak alchohol on the boat and then he will fall over board or get caught on a line. He wrote sober in the paperwork for his captain when it asks ""do you have an addiction"" and he also mentioned it to captain. So his captain knows hes drinking and I am worried. But fuck it honestly. He has never been this bad. Like for 3 days just berating me being so mean. Then feeling guilty. apolgizing, saying I am right, that he doesnt want to be the mean drunk boyfriend, he feels so bad about himself, alchohol doesnt do anything for him. BUt then an hour later just fucking mean. We finally worked it out but I told him my boundary is that I am not going to be with him when hes drinking. But he has no gone backward an says he will only drink sometimes. or that he doesnt want to stop. At one point he said thsi is the hardest thing I can do. but then he goes back into delusion. He has been kind to mea gain and feels terrible. I had a moment of clarity and told him againhow fucked he has been to me and how deeply this has impacted me, the past 3 days I had barely slept or aet on top of the fear of PTSD being alone here in this house. But then I had something happen.. and hes the only person I can call to lean on. I have no family. My friends are busy and I cant just call him u p. I wish I had a mom. I just want a mom right now but I never had one really even though I did.

So yeah. We made up he made amends etc. But he didn't want to stop and I am done giving chances. also there are more things lie I am only his second girlfriend and 3rd person hes slept with, and hes 28, so what if he wants to explore more? Hes bisexual and has never been with a man, so what if he wants that in the future? What if he relapses again? What really got me. Was that this was the worst 3 days he had. And he says hes so worried about me and hates being away but the irony is so he takes that out on me. HE has says he has so much anger and rage bubbling up inside. I think because he also is out of his hometown, doing things to make him feel good about himself and hes angry at his family. Still.

So this morning he called nd I told him yeah I am looking for housing just for myself now. I won't abandon him. i will still be looking forward to seeing him. im gonna take hijm to his truck and do this rpocess. BUt I found an awesome work trade situation on a farm helping an older woman with her animals. So I can live, work , garden, and be with the farm animals and learn from an older homesteading woman while I get a job an start over. I told him this as they are going out to see today, there wont be alchohol on the boat, and I want him to be able to process this before I meet him. He understood and said he thinks  he need more healing to do. He has mentioned before he thinks maybe he shyouldnt even have a girlfirend and although he doesnt want me to leave him or be without me he would understand if I do because he doesn't want me to hurt. What pisses me off is liek okay then go to therapy? go to AA? CHOOSE to be better maybe? but its a disease and hes young . I dont know, We were doing SO well before.

So yeah. My body physicallly feels weak tired and sick after these past 3 days when I just hd such a peaceful month and week before this. I do not want to go back, and I am 31 I want a family. What really solidified it was these past 3 days when he was raging at me on the phone, it felt like talking to my mom and dad. Like no matter how rational I was, he gaslit me, said things that dont even make sense. Which later he admits and acknowledges and makes aamends which my parents never do. But I thought. What if I have a daughter with him, then he breaks sobriety in the future, and treats her like that?

I am so fucking sad. A part of me hopes that he gets off the boat and he actually does it. I see stories of partners who do get sober and their relationship becomes better again. There are so many great aspects to him and our relationship and I also understand why he drank again given the circumstances. But at this point I am kind of over it. I want a man that I dont even have to worry about. Just easy. But I am probably able to do this because I am not around him. Maybe if we seperate as I found huosing and time goes by, and he get sober and stays sober for a while and is doing the work maybe we can try again? I dont know. What happens if he gets off the boat and hes ready and goes to a meeting? Should I give it time? I dont know. PArt of me is sick of this alanon AA bullshit . I dont even want to drink alchohol myself anymore I completely stopped becaause of all of this. Like it doesnt even sound good I got a tall can of an IPA like I used to and I only drank half bc I am like fuck this shit. Its just so much. It doesnt help an old flame reached out to me. HEs an artist, has a great career, lives in the woods like me, is kind of trippy artist mind like me. Very intelligent which my partner is intelligent but also not really on my level but just a different type of intelligence. He ironically has FASD from his mom drinking when she was pregnant with him so he is a bit delayed almost although very wise and teaches me things all the time. I am not going to pursue my old flame I am not ready but it gives me a glimpse into the life I could have.

Yeah. I am almost out of here within the next 3 days. Then I am going to go camp, go meet with teh lovely farm I am going to be staying at. And then when hes off the boat, pick him up and bring him to his truck where we are moving from. I wpont just bail on him becaue that wouldnt be okay and he has no way to get there. Plus hes financially paying for all of my things to get out of here and get to the farm and live which he should honestly . I also want to see him. Im super sad. I am goign to miss him so so much. He truly is my best friend. I love spending time with him and honestly our relationship most of the time is awesome and happy. I dont know. I have been with people and healed from abusive elationships. Ive dated so many men and been so many dates. He truly is like my best friend, my twin. Its so shitty dating and I have never met someone who just dos my love languages, listens to me, communicates so well with me, loves the things that I like to do, takes me camping, takes care of me financially if I need it, lets me be my crazy wild self solo camping and adventruing and loves me for it. He truly sees me and understands me. So its like fuck alchohol. Fuck his shitty parents for giving him a terrible childhood. He had a horrific childhood - noe xcuse but its just so sad. ITs so so sad to me this is how it ends for us when it doesnt have to be. Ive known people to get sober and change their whole lives. But my mom is sober, but shes still a piece of shit although she stands on a pedstal at AA giving vulnerable women advice (which is scary, and she is super wise and gives good advice but shes also the most sick twisted fucking woman . ) . Im so sad and tired.

I went to alanon meeting once it was nice. And no offense to you guys. I would rather work thiis out when I get my new Psychologist. I really dont want to sit in Alanon meetings. My mother is a sensitive subject and honestly it pisses me off and annys me and like going into ""those rooms"" it really does feel liek at home to me. Which I think is fucked I sat through meetings as a 11 year old listening to the most horrific shit. And my mom would alwasy tell me "" If I wasn't sober, you wouldnt have a mom"" which always made me scared. I really dont want to go sit in an alanon meeting. But I will post here.

After finally returning to the village and settling down, I decided to engage in agriculture, along with other endeavors.

For this purpose, I am putting in order the documents of the lands that were privatized during the time of my family, my father. I also want to buy a few hectares of land.

There are many  agriculture related issues, starting from the fact that the village is on the border. There is water shortage. There is no agricultural machinery. There are no labourers. The prices of agricultural products are low, etc....

I have always thought and I still see today that our land demands are for show. We do not cultivate our lands, but we dream of a greater Armenia.

Of course, I am not against Armenia being big, bigger, so big that airplanes are needed to commute between cities and we have numerous airports.

But those wishes and dreams of ours are worthless if we do not cultivate every piece of land that is in our hands today.

And I have also noticed that the farther an Armenian is from Armenia, the more he loves the land, the more he speaks for the Armenian Cause and dream of the Great, Wilsonian Armenia .

Vano (Sirageghyan) wrote: If you do not live in Armenia, what difference does it make to you, whether Armenia is big or small?

I don't criticize anyone and I don't have the right to do so when they prefer to live outside Armenia. But I, kind of don't believe a person who lives abroad, in Armenia presents himself as more patriotic than someone living on Armenian soil.

And all the dishes never fit in the dishwasher, so I end up washing a bunch by hand and let letting them dry. Or I wash our water tumblers and insulated coffee mugs by hand.  I do the dishes every day, they just never end. 

And then there is the laundry. I try not to use towels more than twice before washing, with 3 people I am always washing towels.

I've been working on a project to help make FM player scouting easier at a glance, and to make some of the more advanced data-analysis adjacent parts more accessible.

This has culminated in [FM-Dash](https://fm-dash.com), named since the goal is to provide a 'dashboard' of your save. As well as sharing this to the public now, I'm also wanting to try and gather feedback from people about certain bits of the project, which I'll detail at the end.

**Here's some of the features it's got so far:**

* Summarizing player stats into categories like FIFA/EAFC (Overall, Pace, Shooting, Dribbling, Defending & Physical)

[This is what you'll see when clicking on a player in most parts of FM-Dash](https://preview.redd.it/o15d5112o9gf1.png?width=2482&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae5591ab631c32f2d0b2aac5cdfa23e03d6181e6)

* Ability to see quickly what percentile your player is in for certain stats such as Progressive Passes/90, Crosses Attempted/90 etc.
* Adding players to wishlists directly (more to come with this feature later on)
* 'Upgrade Finder' will let you find alternatives to players in your team instantly.

https://preview.redd.it/q4tcli1dp9gf1.png?width=3148&format=png&auto=webp&s=79ebaaf9e8a3f69c624bb94a89eafc206bc4f1b5

* Share the data either by sending a link to your mates, or export the dataset as CSV or JSON.

In the near future as well, I'll be posting the source-code on GitHub, along with a feature roadmap, and docs on how to self-host this. Very quick disclaimer too, there's a 'Buy me a coffee' link on the site. That's just for hosting costs, and doesn't lock away any features (nor will it ever).

Credit as well to footygamer from sortitoutsi who provided useful guidance, and is the reason you can see real player faces and team logos. You won't see this in the self-hosted version, but you'll be able to specify a local folder for faces and logos (which yes, means you can use custom ones!)

**As for feedback I'm after, here's the basics:**

* The 'first-time' guide is a bit crap right now. Would you rather see:
   * A video that's as close to a minute as possible just for how to get the scouting view you need and how to export the FM data as a web-page
   * A longer-form video (or multiple short-form videos) showing how to get the scouting view, how to export the data but then also how to use FM-Dash, useful tips and so-on
   * Essentially what's already there, but with pictures showing what things should look like in FM itself.
* How much would you personally want to know about things like how the 'Overall' rating for players are calculated, or 'Value Score', 'SHO' and so on. Do you really care? If you do care, where would you want to be able to see the information?
* Just generally, what weird things do you find while using FM-Dash? Naturally, there'll be bugs, but is there anything you see that's just... odd?

  I'm 40 my fiance is 47. I have a 6yo who has been in his life since she was 2. We have lived ogether going on 3 years in November. We have a large house, 3000sqft. My fiance has offered since day 1 of looking for houses that I can stay home.  He makes very good money. 
 He has always said that he loves my daughter like her own (2000% believe this) and that he will always treat her like his own. She does have a ""dad"" but she rarely goes to his house anymore.
 So my fiance pays all the house bills. I work sometimes 20 hours a week. Sometimes I may go weeks without working. So I pay for me and my daughter's stuff and food for the house. Even when I go without working I don't need to ask for money.
 I stopped asking but I used to ask for help with just dishes. Even once every 2 weeks. He says he doesn't have to bc he pays bill and the dishes aren't his so he shouldn't have to clean them. Well obviously some are bc he eats at home and uses coffee cups and cups.
 The almost 3 years we have lived here he's done dishes maybe 6 times. Has never swept or mopped up(once again not his mess he says) has never cleaned our bathroom in our room or the upstairs bathroom which mostly only he uses it and my daughter uses it a few times a week to pee. 
And he's cooked dinner like a hand full of times if that. Even when I had 4 straight weeks of work. Working 5/6 hours in the morning then going back sometimes at 9 at night and working till midnight. 
 So AITAH for wanting help with dishes once and awhile? He doesn't work a physical job. He is a supervisor in a warehouse. He used to be off Friday, Saturday and Sunday but the last couple of months he's been working Friday. He does wake up at 4am and leaves the house at 6. It used to be 5am and leaves at 7. He works usually till 4ish and is home by 5. I'm not even asking for help when he gets home. Just help occasionally on the weekends and literally just dishes",1,1753994836.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

1mecwdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mecwdf/the_cats_making_my_life_miserable/,The cats making my life miserable.,"My girlfriend and I adopted 2 cats (Cat A and Cat B) a year ago. Plan was getting only one but they were sisters so we get both off them thinking that they would get along and not get bored.

Every morning, Cat A did what cats do (meowing, jumping on us, scratching things including tv, meowing louder etc) to wake us up around 6 am. She wants food or she is bored or she just likes doing it. We did everything we can to stop it. Like closing our bedroom door, leaving dry food out at night so she can have it in the morning, we stop giving them wet food in the morning, we bought tons of toys, we bought feeder, we made her sleeping next to us, we made her sleeping in front of the window where she can see 10‚Äôs of birds in the morning and many more thing we read from online sources, ChatGPT, 3 different vets.

On top of that, Cat A continued this on the day time when I needed to work. I played with her hours sometimes but nothing changed. That said there are moments when the cat A is calm as well.

Cat B is another story. She has on and off ringworms. Like she gets it, we catch it immediately because I am home and I can see, use creams, baths (not the pill yet), clean the house, steam everything, like everything you can imagine at the home, wash everything we can wash, dust everything we can dust. Also we hired professionals to clean the house. Cat A never got it but Cat B seems to never get rid of it permanently.

Since the GF was working full time, she would come home and sleep in 3 hours and leave home in the mornings. I have to deal with Their bathrooms, food, cleaning them, playing with them, making sure when Cat A meows I check her to make sure she is ok. GF would do a lot on the weekend to help!

Not to mention both of them had poop around our kitchen and I had to clean it before even I start my days. Before I made a coffee! Sand is all over every morning etc. you know what I am talking if you have cat.

In a very short time it was clear to me that they were not helping me but I was having many bad days because of it. I communicate this to GF. Her response were ‚Äúwhat were you thinking before we decided to get a cat?‚Äù Or ‚Äú this is part of the pet ownership‚Äù

I got it, she works all day and this is not something that only our cats doing. Totally agreed that I should have thought this better. But clearly, I did not.

I tried my best 10-11 months while I communicated with GF saying, ‚Äú I can not work close to 6 hours even because they always need something. I need help. I feel depressed, dirty, I feel like ring worms going to get me (which it did)‚Äù.

And the cherry on top, we recently moved to a country that we wanted to move since 2 years. But the move and my life became even more miserable. So many vet visits before, and so much money spend on cats, which is worth for the cats, they are a living creatures like us and money is not something should be the reason for me to not happy but because we have them, we had spend a few thousands and most importantly still having really hard time to find a place to live. Everything ending up costing premium and you guessed it right, I can not work that long to make more money for those premium expenses. In the Resul, my life degraded despite I moved to a place I thought would bring happiness.

On top of that, Cat B is having ringworms again. Poor cat probably stressed due to move.

So I asked GF many times to see if she would be understanding what I am going through with these cats and would be open to find a home for our cats. She says it will affect her badly. I got it, I love those cats too‚Ä¶

I don‚Äôt know what to do, what to feel. I am not happy. I need to work hard to get the life I am wanting and it‚Äôs been 4 months, every morning I woke up with this stress.

So now, I am wanting to find a house for the cats. I told this to her and GF is acting like I am the devil.

1mecu5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mecu5r/delve_into_the_best_ice_maker_aglucky_red_review/,Delve Into the Best Ice Maker AGLUCKY Red Review Worth Reading,"Testing the AGLUCKY Z5880-RED has been an icy experience, and I mean that in the best way. Setting it up on my kitchen countertop, I was immediately struck by its vibrant red design. It‚Äôs compact yet sturdy, slotting neatly into my limited kitchen space. For a consistent ice enthusiast like me (and trust me, I‚Äôve made ice for everything from smoothies to chilled beverages), its size and portability are an absolute win. Let me dive deeper into my hands-on experience, sharing both the gems and quirks of this countertop ice maker.

**Stylish and Compact Design**  
One of the first things that grab attention is its sleek and modern red exterior. Measuring just 12.3 inches deep, 8.7 inches wide, and 12.6 inches high, it doesn‚Äôt dominate my countertop yet makes a statement. Whether you're hosting a casual gathering or just craving cold coffee on a sweltering evening, its portability stands out. I tested moving it to my friend‚Äôs barbecue party, and it fit easily in the backseat of my car! On top of the aesthetic appeal, the transparent window on the top adds a nice touch. I could watch as the ice formed, almost hypnotically.

**Efficient Ice Production**  
What really impressed me was its speed. Within 6-8 minutes, nine bullet-shaped ice cubes were ready to chill my drink. That‚Äôs practically faster than waiting for my kettle to boil water! Over 24 hours, it can produce up to 26 pounds of ice. I‚Äôve tested putting it through its paces during a family brunch, and no one was left wanting more ice. This machine works tirelessly. Unlike some other units I‚Äôve tried, it also operates without annoying noise‚Äîgreat for using late at night when everyone‚Äôs asleep. That quiet cooling system definitely feels like a thoughtful design feature.

**Multiple Ice Size Options and Functionality**  
Options make everything better, right? This countertop ice maker offers two sizes of bullet-shaped ice: small and large. I found the large-sized cubes perfect for cocktails, while the smaller ones worked better for crushed ice recipes or soft drinks. The rounded corners of the bullet ice cubes are a surprisingly nice touch; they won‚Äôt poke or hurt your hands while scooping. Moreover, indicators on the machine signal when it‚Äôs full or when it‚Äôs time to add water, which is incredibly handy, considering I tend to lose track during busy kitchen prep.

Check [AGLUCKY Z5880-RED] price on Amazon.

**User-Friendly and Self-Cleaning**  
No one likes tedious cleaning processes. Lucky for me, this unit takes care of most of it. The self-cleaning function simplifies maintenance, giving me more time to enjoy my ice-cold beverages rather than scrubbing parts. Just press a button, and it does its magic. I‚Äôve tested the cleaning cycle a couple of times now, and it seems to be keeping things hygienic and odor-free. Convenience like this is highly underrated!

**Healthy Ice Cubes for a Safe Experience**  
Health-conscious features are becoming increasingly essential in appliances, and this product didn‚Äôt disappoint. The machine produces clean and pure ice cubes, which put my mind at ease. That transparent top isn‚Äôt just for aesthetics‚Äîyou can verify the cleanliness of the process. It‚Äôs ideal if you‚Äôre using ice for a mix of beverages and food, ensuring it won‚Äôt pick up any questionable tastes or odors.

**Advantages**  
Here are the strong points I noticed:  
- Produces ice in just 6-8 minutes.  
- Compact and portable design; perfect for small spaces and gatherings.  
- Two size options for bullet-shaped ice cubes.  
- Quiet operation and energy-efficient cooling.  
- Self-cleaning functionality simplifies maintenance.

**Negatives**  
No product is perfect, and I did notice some areas for improvement:  
- The ice basket‚Äôs capacity isn‚Äôt huge and fills up quickly during parties.  
- Water needs frequent refilling if used continuously.  
- It doesn‚Äôt keep the ice frozen for long, so you‚Äôll need to transfer cubes to storage if not used immediately.

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing this to other portable ice makers like Euhomy and Frigidaire models shows a few differences. While the AGLUCKY shines in speed and quietness, Euhomy machines tend to have larger ice storage capacity, which can be a game-changer for larger parties. Frigidaire‚Äôs units, on the other hand, sometimes edge out in durability, particularly if used outdoors. However, those units often lack the self-cleaning feature, and the red design of the AGLUCKY certainly outclasses the plain options of its competitors. Each brand has its perks, but for style and simplicity, this one stands tall.

**Bang for the Buck**  
This machine offers a lot for its price point. The design, convenience, and functionality make it suitable for homes, offices, or even occasional outdoor parties. You might find other machines that produce slightly more ice or have larger baskets, but as a balance of style, speed, and ease of use, it‚Äôs genuinely hard to beat. The self-cleaning function, in particular, adds even more value by extending its usability. For those on a budget or lacking counter space, investing in this ice maker wouldn‚Äôt feel like overspending.

There‚Äôs a good chance your home already holds more potential than you think. Maybe you‚Äôve walked past the backyard a hundred times and imagined doing something with it like turning that blank space into something more inviting. Maybe you‚Äôve stared out your sliding door, thinking how nice it‚Äôd be to sip your coffee outside without stepping into wet grass.

If that‚Äôs you,[ timber outdoor decking](https://namsoontimber.com/) might be the answer you‚Äôve been overlooking. It‚Äôs more than a surface. It helps you enjoy a better lifestyle now, while steadily boosting your home‚Äôs value for the future. It adds comfort, visual appeal, and function without requiring major renovations. And best of all? It creates a space that feels personal.

You don‚Äôt need to tear down walls to feel like your home just got bigger. Sometimes, all it takes is a beautifully crafted deck. Let‚Äôs explore why it‚Äôs one of the smartest, most emotionally satisfying upgrades you can make.

**1. You Expand Your Space Without Expanding Your Footprint**

You know that feeling of being a little too cramped indoors? It creeps in slowly. Maybe during a birthday party when you‚Äôve run out of seating. Or when everyone‚Äôs crowding the kitchen at the same time.

A timber deck offers breathing room. It creates room for you to relax, entertain, breathe, and flow through your day with ease. It acts as an extension of your home, even though you haven‚Äôt added a single square metre to your indoor layout.

That flexibility matters. Whether you‚Äôre enjoying it yourself or showing the property to buyers. They‚Äôll see extra living space and picture how they‚Äôd use it. And they‚Äôll like what they see.

**2. You Create a First Impression That Speaks Without Saying a Word**

Before someone even steps inside, they‚Äôve already started forming an opinion. And if what greets them is a sleek, well-maintained timber deck, they‚Äôll feel something strong: care.

A polished deck sets the tone. It says you‚Äôve taken the time to invest in your home‚Äôs appearance. The natural warmth and texture of real timber has a way of drawing people in effortlessly. And when you‚Äôve included anti-slip outdoor decking solutions, you‚Äôre not just thinking about looks. You're thinking about their safety, too.

These small decisions leave a quiet, lasting impact. And buyers remember homes that made them feel safe, stylish, and welcomed from the start.

**3. You Add Value Without Going Over Your Budget**

Home improvements can get out of hand. But a deck? It‚Äôs the kind of project where the payoff often exceeds what you spend. You‚Äôre enhancing more than just your home‚Äôs appearance. You‚Äôre making it more functional, more appealing, and ultimately more marketable.

When done right, timber decking is considered a permanent feature. It‚Äôs not a throwaway fix or a trend. It becomes part of the home‚Äôs value story.

And if you're looking for even less maintenance over time, you might explore composite wood decking. It offers a sleek finish with excellent durability, appealing to busy homeowners who want good design without the upkeep.

**4. You Finally Give Purpose to Wasted Outdoor Space**

We all have that one spot outside that doesn‚Äôt get much love. Maybe it‚Äôs the patch of uneven grass no one uses. Maybe it‚Äôs the tiled balcony that collects dust. You walk past it. You ignore it. But deep down, you wish it had a purpose.

Now imagine turning that space into a place where your family has dinner on breezy nights, where your kids play while you relax, or where you simply sit and catch your breath after a long day.

That‚Äôs what a deck does. And with growing demand for balcony and patio decking installation, even high-rise homeowners are making the most of their vertical living. You don‚Äôt need a big yard. You just need smart use of space.

**5. You Speak to Buyers Who Want Thoughtful, Eco-Minded Design**

It‚Äôs not just about beauty anymore. Buyers are thinking about sustainability. They‚Äôre asking whether your materials support the environment. And if you‚Äôve chosen eco-friendly timber decking, that question is answered without you saying a word.

Sustainable timber, especially when sourced from responsible suppliers, adds more than physical value. It gives your home a layer of purpose. A sense of ethics. And for modern buyers, that‚Äôs worth a lot.

You're showing that good design can coexist with better choices for the planet. And that kind of care makes your home stand out.

**6. You Seamlessly Blend Indoor Comfort with Outdoor Freshness**

Ever walk into a space that just feels right? Where inside and outside don‚Äôt feel like separate worlds? That‚Äôs what timber decking can offer.

When you align your flooring levels and colour palettes, your deck becomes a continuation of your interior. That easy flow makes everything feel more open, more intentional, and more welcoming.

And when you use weather-resistant wooden flooring, that connection holds strong, even when Singapore‚Äôs skies decide to test you. You won‚Äôt find yourself stressing when the rain suddenly hits. Your deck keeps its shape, and your lifestyle doesn‚Äôt skip a beat.

**7. You Build a Feature That‚Äôs Made to Handle Singapore‚Äôs Heat and Humidity**

Singapore doesn‚Äôt go easy on materials. From blazing sun to sudden rain, your deck has to be tough. And if you‚Äôre using timber outdoor decking built from durable hardwoods like Chengal or Merbau, you‚Äôre in good hands.

These types of wood naturally resist warping, rotting, and pest damage. With basic maintenance like oiling every six months, you keep them strong and looking great for years. You‚Äôre not just building a surface. You‚Äôre investing in a feature that lasts.

And potential buyers will notice. When they ask, ‚ÄúHow does this hold up over time?‚Äù you‚Äôll have a confident answer.

**8. You Help Buyers Picture Themselves Living There**

People don‚Äôt fall in love with statistics. They fall in love with feelings. When someone stands on your deck and imagines their morning coffee there, or hears laughter from future gatherings, you‚Äôve already made the sale.

A timber deck gives buyers a sense of home before they even walk through the living room. It gives them something to dream about. Something to feel. And when they feel connected, they act faster, with more certainty.

That emotional pull can‚Äôt be forced. But it can be built board by board.

When you invest in timber outdoor decking, you‚Äôre not just building something for the present. You‚Äôre giving yourself more room to live, more chances to connect, and more appeal when the time comes to sell.

Your home should grow with you. It should reflect what you care about. Comfort, quality, sustainability, and style. And a timber deck? It checks every one of those boxes, while giving you a space to breathe, reflect, and enjoy.

So if you‚Äôve been waiting for a sign to start, maybe this is it. You deserve a home that feels like home inside and out. And this one change? It just might be the one that ties it all together.

I don‚Äôt know if I am over- or under-reacting and don‚Äôt really know who to talk to about this.

I (36M) just found out that my wife (37F) met up with a former male colleague today, when she said she would be at work and then continuously lied about when I asked her. She has met up with this guy several times before, but this is the first time she has directly lied. For background we have been together for 17 years, married for 5 years and have two kids (7 and 5). 

She was acting cagey when I asked her what she was doing at work today - she said going into HQ at her work for a 30 minute meeting, which she usually tries to avoid, because of the commute, but today that was no issue at all. Meeting did not seem very important, so I asked if she was doing or meeting anyone else in there and she said no. Later after picking up our kids I wonder where she is because her meeting should have been over long ago. I check her location, because we share via find my iPhone - and wanted to see if she had left, because we needed to go shopping for dinner and she had promised to do it. That‚Äôs when I see that she is at a park and not in the office. I call her to ask if I should take the kids and pick up groceries and she says - ‚Äúyes that would be great, I got stuck at the office, but will leave from here soon‚Äù Didn‚Äôt call her on it as I was with the kids, but definitely felt weird.

She gets home later complaining about being sweaty and just wanting to shower (to be fair she has biked as part of her commute and is in her period at the moment - sorry if that is TMI). I asked her how her day was and why she got stuck at the office today. She again says that she just got deep into researching something she is working on and lost track of time. Something just feels of, but I don‚Äôt want to confront her in front of the kids so I wait until they are asleep.

Confrontation goes something like this: 
Me: Why were you so late at the office today?
Her: Just got deep into some research
Me: So you were just at the office the whole time?
Her: Yes, why do you ask?
Me: Because I checked your location before I called you to see if you where on your way and you where at the park. Why did you say you were in the office?
Her: I was out for a walk with someone
Me: Who?
Her: ‚ÄúName of the former male colleague‚Äù
Me: Why didn‚Äôt you just say that? 
Her: Didn‚Äôt think it would be important
Me: When did you arrange this?
Her: he wrote me today and we found out we were both in the same area and went for a walk
Me: This seems weird - why wouldn‚Äôt you just tell me? Can I see your messages with him?
Her: uh, sure (hands med the messages)
I start to feel stupid here, but still read the messages (they write together on LinkedIn). 

They have been writing all week and planning to meet up all along. They even write stuff like ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait to see you üòç‚Äù.  ‚ÄúLooking forward to it ü´∂‚Äù and sending ‚ô•Ô∏è. Nothing is super flirty in the text other than the emojis (a few of the messages have been edited though) The thread goes back months, but mainly contains messages about meeting up for coffee or wine sometimes. Always in the daytime and mostly in public - one time at his office. They have met roughly once a month for the past 6 months.
To begin with she says she can‚Äôt see the big deal and when I press her about the lying she can‚Äôt really explain why she lied to me about it. ‚ÄúIt just seemed easier‚Äù or ‚Äúyou were creeping me out with you questions so I got nervous‚Äù

The reason I got really mad is:
1. She lied about where she was, 
2. When confronted she lied about how long it has been planned, 
3. When I asked how long the walk in the park was, she said 30 minutes, but I could see from the messages and her location that is was more like 90 minutes - which she then also backpedaled on 
4. When they have met previously she did not mention it until after the fact (when she got home smelling of wine), which have always made me feel a bit weird. 

I am normally not a jealous guy and she has not given me reasons to doubt her in the past, but her interactions with this guy and how she talks about him makes me really uncomfortable.

I feel like a line has definitely been crossed - she lied to me and purposefully hid something from me. I don‚Äôt have anything concrete on if they hooked up or anything like that, but it still feels like she kind of cheated on me. While I was typing this she came to me and said she was sorry that she lied and that she can see it was wrong. She still can‚Äôt explain why she lied but swears that nothing happened and he is just a friend. But I don‚Äôt know how I can trust when she just lied to my face several times without blinking and only confessed when I caught her in lie.

Don‚Äôt know if I can move past it - I still feel like there is more to the story but can‚Äôt prove anything. So please help me out here - am I over- or under-reacting here? What would you do if it was you?

More background:
She only worked with him for about 6 months 2-3 years ago and not very closely. Back then she said stuff like ‚Äúoh he is just so funny and will send me fun memes on teams all day‚Äù and ‚Äúwe are planning on taking a work trip to an office in another country - that would just be so much fun with him‚Äù It felt off at the time, but she got another job and never went on a work trip with him, so I parked it. He is also married, but does not have kids.

When they started hanging out again 6 months ago it started feeling weird again. It usually matched around when we would have small fights about stuff (nothing major). We have been having trouble connecting in general (for longer than the 6 months) and I have been trying to work on it with her, but she seems disengaged and is not really interested in going on dates with me anymore (like at all) or being intimate as much as in the past.

Spent the last five years working in SEO for big brands. long days in the agency world, then coming home and jumping straight into our own projects till way too late. had a few wins, lost just as much. but this one stuck.

Earlier this year we moved in together to work more on our projects. Most nights it‚Äôs just the two of us in the living room, laptops open, empty coffee mugs piling up, trying to figure out how to make this work. arguing about how to make workflows easier for everyone.

I've used n8n almost daily for 2 years, mostly to automate repetitive tasks at the agency. Every time someone said ‚Äún8n can do that‚Äù, i knew what would happen next. I'd be the one building it.. The people asking were usually the real specialists (except for SEO üòâ). They knew exactly what needed to be automated, well better than me. but the learning curve of n8n is steep, so they‚Äôd pass it on.

In the last few months many new tools have launched claiming they can build workflows from text. I tried them all. nice diagrams and for some it does work, but they‚Äôre band-aids. They guess their way through, often use outdated nodes, and you still end up fixing more than you build.

so we started working on our own solution. months of late nights, breaking stuff, starting over. not one magic ai extension, but multiple agents in a chat that actually know n8n. a planner that maps the steps. a builder that connects the right up-to-date nodes. a validator that checks if it will really run in n8n before you export it (without using your API credentials. Don‚Äôt connect your API‚Äôs to tools you don‚Äôt trust)

The goal is simple. You describe what you want to build, the agents guide you step by step, it starts with question cards. Small, clear options you can click. Pick a trigger. Pick what happens next. Add a condition. Every answer adds a node in the preview. If something‚Äôs missing, the agent asks again.¬†

We met through our husbands (who were friends since childhood) 20 years ago. Although we‚Äôve had times when life got busy and we didn‚Äôt see each other often, we never have gone this long. We used to get together with our families (and occasionally just us moms). 

I was the last one to organize a get together at a comedy club and I thought we had a great time. But then the dreaded texting came - we tried to nail down the next outing but they both kept saying how busy they were with their kids‚Äô sports and never offered up an alternative time. 

I tried one more time a year ago with an event husband I were going to. They both took forever to respond and eventually said they couldn‚Äôt come. 

I gave up and decided to see what would happen if I let go of this and focused on other interests and people (and I have gained a lot!)

Well what happened with them? Neither has made a single attempt to get together with me (and it‚Äôs now been 2 years).

Last summer I saw a social media post of their families vacationing together and I cried. 

To be fair, my husband gave up a long time ago on those friends, and the guys have also made no effort. 

But the weird thing is that these two friends still text me on my birthday or other holidays as if nothing has changed. 

One of them, ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù, has a common interest with me and will once in a while text me about that topic - but still make no attempt to get together. 

I recently decided to try again - but only with Sarah, and literally only us two (so not trying to include our husbands or kids). Just keep it simple. 

I asked if she wanted to meet up for coffee. She immediately said yes (but also asked if everything is ok). 

I‚Äôm not sure if/when this will actually happen. 

Assuming it does, I‚Äôm trying to decide my approach. 

I think it‚Äôs best to keep it light and fun. If I say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm hurt you haven‚Äôt attempted to see me in 2 years‚Äù - she will probably feel awful but nothing will change.

## Key Features Analysis

the following are essential aspects of performance and value for consumers considering peppermint-scented air fresheners in 2025.

**Scent Authenticity and Longevity:**

the authenticity of the peppermint scent is paramount. The best air fresheners accurately capture the refreshing and slightly sweet essence of natural peppermint, avoiding artificial or overly synthetic notes. A high-quality peppermint air freshener will feature fragrances with a natural source, whether from peppermint oil or other natural extracts. Furthermore, the scent must have good longevity, pervading the space for a satisfactory period without fading too quickly. This means the fragrance formulation shoudl be designed to release the scent gradually for several hours. A product should deliver continuous freshness, not just a fleeting burst.

**dispersion Method and Coverage Area:**

The method by which the air freshener disperses its scent substantially impacts its effectiveness. Options range from aerosol sprays and plug-in diffusers to reed diffusers and gel-based air fresheners. each dispersion method has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of scent intensity and coverage area. For larger spaces, a plug-in diffuser or aerosol spray may be preferable, providing more widespread distribution. For smaller rooms, a reed diffuser or gel air freshener could offer a more subtle and controlled release.the ability of the air freshener to effectively scent the intended space is a critical metric.

**Ingredients and Safety:**

Consumers are increasingly mindful of the ingredients used in household products, especially those that release into the air. The best peppermint air fresheners prioritize natural and non-toxic ingredients, minimizing the use of harsh chemicals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and allergens. A transparency in labeling allows consumers to make informed choices. Some products may also offer eco-friendly formulations and recyclable packaging for environmentally conscious consumers.Safety for pets and children is also an notable consideration.

**Device or Refill Lifespan:**

For plug-in diffusers and other devices, the lifespan of the refill or the device itself is a crucial factor in determining overall value. A longer lifespan translates to less frequent replacements and a more sustained fragrance experience. manufacturers often specify an estimated lifespan based on average usage. Understanding device longevity helps consumers budget effectively and minimize waste. Consumers should consider the cost per day of fragrance when comparing options.

**Adjustability and Control:**

The ability to adjust the intensity of the peppermint scent is a valuable feature, accommodating individual preferences and the size of the space. Some air fresheners offer adjustable settings, allowing users to control the amount of fragrance released. This feature is especially useful for those who prefer a subtle scent or for adapting the fragrance level to different rooms or times of day. The lack of adjustability can lead to an overpowering scent in smaller areas.

## Core Benefits

The value of a peppermint-centric air freshener goes beyond mere fragrance, touching on various aspects of sensory experience and emotional well-being.

**Enhanced Mood and Energy:** The invigorating scent of peppermint is known for its ability to uplift mood and boost energy levels. The aroma stimulates the senses, promoting alertness and reducing feelings of fatigue. Users report feeling more focused and productive after being exposed to the scent of peppermint.

**Odor Neutralization:** Peppermint is not only a pleasant scent; it's also an effective odor neutralizer. It can mask and eliminate unpleasant smells from pets, cooking, or stagnant air, leaving behind a clean and fresh aroma. Instead of simply covering up odors, peppermint fragrances effectively target the root causes, leaving the air feeling truly clean. This is especially useful in high-traffic areas or spaces prone to lingering smells.

**Improved Focus and Concentration:** The stimulating properties of peppermint can improve focus and concentration.Studies have shown that inhaling peppermint scent can enhance cognitive function and memory. This can be beneficial in office environments, study spaces, or anywhere that requires mental clarity. The crisp and clean aroma helps to clear the mind and promote alertness.

Gel air fresheners also offer longer-lasting fragrance, gradually diffusing the peppermint scent over time. The type of product will affect the length that is able to be enjoyed.

Though, most air fresheners contain diluted amounts of peppermint oil that are unlikely to cause harm if used as directed. it's always best to keep air fresheners out of reach of pets and to consult with a veterinarian if you have any concerns. If used as directed, most should cause no issue to house pets.**Can peppermint air fresheners provide health benefits?**

1mecp7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mecp7l/should_you_try_the_best_coffee_maker_nespresso/,Should You Try the Best Coffee Maker Nespresso Gran Lattissima by DeLonghi,"Nespresso Gran Lattissima by De'Longhi, White, landed on my kitchen counter with promises of premium coffee without ever leaving home. Being a coffee enthusiast, I had my reservations about whether this stylish little machine could pull its weight compared to my barista-made favorites. Over weeks of testing, here's how it lived up to the hype and where it fell a bit short.

**Modern Aesthetic and Practical Design**  
The first thing I noticed about the Nespresso Gran Lattissima was its sleek look. The combination of matte and high-gloss finishes, along with stainless steel accents, made it feel luxurious. It has a compact build, and the glass touch panel adds a tech-savvy vibe to the design. Sliding the drip tray to accommodate different cup sizes felt intuitive and simple. The removable milk container‚Äîgenius! After steaming my morning lattes, I popped it straight into the fridge. It's like this machine considered every little design annoyance of coffee-making and just smoothed them out.

**Versatility for Coffee Cravings**  
My mornings are unpredictable, shifting between the need for a no-nonsense shot of espresso and a creamy cappuccino. This beauty lets you pick from nine beverage options, including foamed milk recipes and flat white. Testing the different drinks was‚Äîit has to be said‚Äîa joyful little ritual. One touch, and I had a cup that could rival any coffee chain's offering in terms of flavor and structure. Even my moody coworker, who dropped by for a meeting, gave an approving smirk after sipping the latte I made for them. That says a lot.

**Check [Nespresso Gran Lattissima by De'Longhi, White] price on Amazon.**  

**Top-Tier Coffee Performance**  
Under the hood, the 19-bar high-pressure pump is the unsung hero of this machine. Every espresso shot had the perfect layer of crema on top, which is a non-negotiable for me. The fast heat-up system was another game-changer. From cold machine to rich espresso? It only took seconds, not minutes, which is critical during those groggy mornings when every second counts. I‚Äôll admit, though, it made me a little too reliant on ""just one more quick cup.""

**Winning Points**  
- Effortless one-touch recipes that genuinely deliver caf√©-quality beverages.  
- Compact and visually stunning design.  
- Sliding drip tray and removable milk container for adaptable and practical use.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Over time, the premium finish can show wear and tear if not cleaned carefully.  
- The milk frothing system, while convenient, doesn‚Äôt offer manual control for users who prefer customization.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing it to similar single-serve coffee makers, such as the Breville Nespresso Creatista Plus, revealed a few insights. While other products might offer slightly more customization options, the Gran Lattissima wins for ease of use. Machines like the Keurig K-Caf√© are more budget-friendly but lack the same sleek efficiency and quality of espresso. If you lean more toward simplicity and reliable flavor, the Gran Lattissima takes the crown. The downside here is the price‚Äîit's not the most cost-effective option, especially for those who don‚Äôt drink milk-based drinks as often.

**Quality for Price**  
Let‚Äôs talk value because no coffee machine should cost as much as a minor appliance unless it earns its keep. Is it worth it? If you‚Äôre all about consistent, quality coffee without extra fuss, yes. However, the expense leans more toward an investment piece. For casual coffee drinkers or those only looking for an occasional treat, an alternative, lower-priced option might make more sense. That said, the convenience and premium design do counterbalance the cost for serious coffee enthusiasts.

Concrete walls vibrated with noise as the crowd surged toward the stage, a pit of thrashing bodies screaming back lyrics into the face of the boy who sang them.

‚ÄúWE DON‚ÄôT NEED YOUR CITY RULES!‚Äù he howled into the mic, veins bulging in his neck, fingers white around the stand. ‚ÄúWE DON‚ÄôT NEED YOUR BARS OR BADGE!‚Äù

The distortion cracked, the drums thundered, and the boy ‚Äî 17-year-old Ben Parker ‚Äî kicked over the mic stand, dropped his guitar, and dove headfirst into the pit.

The Arachnids weren‚Äôt just a band. They were war.

They played in condemned buildings. In abandoned churches and seedy bowling alleys. Their gigs ended in blood, arrests, and sometimes small riots. Ben didn‚Äôt care. Ben was born angry. Born loud. And he didn‚Äôt ask to be named after an old man he never met.

He was the son of a man who used to build better futures for others and a woman who used to believe people deserved second chances. Now his mom, MJ, worked double shifts at a hospital in South Chicago and came home smelling like bleach and broken hearts. His dad, Peter Parker ‚Äî a soft-spoken lab technician at Octavius Industries ‚Äî worked behind a desk under fluorescent lights while drones made coffee and algorithms decided what got researched.

Ben had no idea why Peter always seemed afraid of his own shadow. But whatever haunted the old man, Ben inherited none of it.


---

The night of the bite, it rained like hell.

Lightning forked the sky above Fulton Market as the Arachnids packed their gear into a stolen van. Ben, half-drunk and laughing, was the last one out. He forgot his pack inside the warehouse, so he climbed back in through a broken window.

The warehouse had been abandoned for over a year before they claimed it for punk shows. But what no one knew was it sat next to a quiet offsite Octavius storage lab, sealed and forgotten after some ‚Äúincident‚Äù in 2016.

That night, something was awake inside.

Ben grabbed his pack and turned to go when he saw it: a shattered window on the adjacent wall. Light spilled in ‚Äî green and eerie ‚Äî revealing a heavy steel door pried open. A chill ran through him, and he stepped closer. Something moved inside.

He thought it was a cat.

Then it landed on his shoulder.

The pain was white-hot and fast. Ben slapped it off and caught a flash of red and blue ‚Äî like a glitch in a cartoon ‚Äî before the thing scuttled out through the broken window.

He stumbled outside, dizzy. It wasn‚Äôt the beer. Something was changing.


---

He barely slept that night.

His body ached, muscles pulling tight like piano wires. When he stood the next morning, he cracked the ceiling with his head.

He couldn‚Äôt stop sweating. Couldn‚Äôt sit still. He could see the ants crawling on the sidewalk from his bedroom window. Hear the cars two blocks away. His hands stuck to everything. Literally. His fingertips clung to his phone until it cracked.

When he tried to peel himself out of bed, he ended up stuck on the ceiling.


---

At school, things got worse.

Ben had been a ghost in class before: ditching lectures, failing tests, sneaking out to practice with the band. But today, he heard every heartbeat in the building. Smelled someone‚Äôs lunch from across the hallway. A kid shoved him near the lockers ‚Äî just a stupid bump ‚Äî but Ben whipped around, grabbed him by the collar, and flung him ten feet down the hall.

Everyone saw.

Security was called. He ran. Vaulted the fence. Landed three stories down in the alley and didn‚Äôt even feel it.


---

Ben went home early. Peter was waiting.

‚ÄúI got a call,‚Äù Peter said, arms folded, voice tight.

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou nearly put a kid in the ER.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have shoved me then.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs expression darkened. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre not‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Not you? Good. You spend your whole life hiding, and for what? Punching keys for some fascist science corp that makes drones and disease patents?‚Äù

‚ÄúBen‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. You want me to be scared of the world like you. I‚Äôm not. I won‚Äôt.‚Äù

Peter‚Äôs voice was hoarse. ‚ÄúThere are consequences for touching things you don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

Ben pushed past him. His fingers crushed the doorknob without meaning to.


---

That night, he climbed the Sears Tower.

Not because he wanted to jump ‚Äî but because something inside needed to know how high he could go.

The wind howled around him. Chicago glowed like a firepit below. His hoodie flapped like wings. He stood there ‚Äî 1,400 feet up ‚Äî and spread his arms.

And that‚Äôs when he heard the scream.

A woman. Somewhere in the alley below. Then a gunshot.

He didn‚Äôt think. He leapt.

The fall should‚Äôve killed him.

Instead, he landed on the side of a building like a gecko, springboarding downward in a blur of motion, flipping mid-air, and slamming into the gunman as he raised the weapon again.

The guy went flying. Ben webbed him to a dumpster ‚Äî only realizing he could shoot webs once it happened ‚Äî and checked on the woman, who stared at him like he was some kind of hallucination.

‚ÄúYou‚Äîwhat are you?!‚Äù

Ben blinked. Then smiled.

‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôm unbreakable.‚Äù


---

News of the alley vigilante spread like wildfire.

Social feeds blew up. Blurry videos of a masked figure ‚Äî hoodie, gloves, no costume yet ‚Äî leaping rooftops. Stopping muggers. Tagging his scenes with red spray paint: a crude spider symbol with an anarchy A for a body.

He was already a rockstar underground. Now he was a ghost story for criminals.

The media called him ‚ÄúSpider-Punk.‚Äù

Ben liked it.


---

Meanwhile, Mayor Wilson Fisk watched the chaos from his office atop City Hall ‚Äî the old Masonic Temple rebuilt under his regime as a monument to ‚Äústability and progress.‚Äù Chicago had once called him a savior. He poured money into infrastructure. Bought police drones from Octavius Industries. Turned neighborhoods into surveillance grids.

But the rats kept crawling out of the cracks.

And now one had eight legs.

He clicked the grainy security footage again: the figure in the hoodie, face hidden, body bending like a gymnast on fire, leaping across twenty feet of alley in a single motion.

Fisk grunted. ‚ÄúParker.‚Äù


---

The connection wasn‚Äôt hard to trace.

Octavius Industries had a breach two weeks earlier. One of their experimental cross-species arachnids escaped during transport. Only three researchers had security clearance to that division. One of them was Peter Parker.

Fisk ordered a private black-ops unit to ‚Äúinterview‚Äù Peter. Not at his home. At the lab.

Peter never came home that night.


---

Ben got the call from MJ in tears.

‚ÄúThey said he had a breakdown. He...he left work and didn‚Äôt say anything. The company won‚Äôt tell me anything else.‚Äù

Ben felt a coldness grip his throat.

He knew his dad. Knew he was quiet, anxious, weird. But disappearing like this? Not him.

Ben knew something was wrong.

He donned the mask ‚Äî a makeshift one this time, stitched from old bandanas ‚Äî and broke into Octavius Industries.

The place was a fortress. Automated drones. Electric floors. Retina locks. But none of it mattered now. Ben moved like a blur. His instincts took over. He crawled through air vents like a shadow.

And in the basement lab, he found it.

Not Peter. But video logs. Files. Experiments dating back ten years. Spider genetics. Neural reprogramming. Project MONARCH. All leading to a single thesis: control the brain through arachnid-based neurotoxins.

A weaponized spider, built to enslave rather than empower.

And Peter? He‚Äôd tried to shut it down once. A quiet protest. But Octavius ‚Äî backed by Fisk ‚Äî ordered him to continue under threat of termination.

The spider that bit Ben wasn‚Äôt meant to escape. But maybe‚Ä¶ Peter let it.

Ben took the files. Burned the lab on his way out.


---

Back at the hideout ‚Äî a crumbling church turned punk venue in Logan Square ‚Äî Ben confronted the band.

‚ÄúI know who I am now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd I know what I need to do.‚Äù

Jules, the drummer and his best friend, raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat, like fight crime?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm gonna bring down Fisk.‚Äù

The bassist, Dwayne, laughed. ‚ÄúYeah, okay, and then what? We all get medals?‚Äù

Ben pulled out the stolen files and dropped them on the table.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs experimenting on people. Using tech to control minds. My dad found out and now he‚Äôs gone. I think he‚Äôs being held somewhere. Tortured. Maybe worse.‚Äù

A silence fell.

Then Jules said, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what do we do?‚Äù

Ben looked out the cracked stained-glass window. The city loomed.

‚ÄúWe start a riot.‚Äù


---

That night, they hit a checkpoint.

Fisk had been installing facial-recognition gates all over the Loop. The Arachnids hit one with homemade EMPs, blew a hole in it, tagged it with spider graffiti, and escaped into the shadows.

The footage went viral.

Ben‚Äôs mask was cleaner now. Red and black, patched with leather and duct tape. He moved faster. Hit harder. His spider sense kept him one step ahead of every drone, every cop, every camera.

But Fisk was watching.

And waiting.


---

The trap was set in Bronzeville.

A staged robbery. Innocents in danger. Ben swooped in like always ‚Äî only to find a squad of Fisk‚Äôs new private task force waiting.

They called themselves The Enforcers. Not cops. Not military. But something worse: ex-military with no badges and no mercy.

Ben fought like a whirlwind. Dodging bullets. Tearing down walls. Flipping between soldiers with web-laced fury.

But they had sonic weapons. Pulse emitters. Stuff meant to disable someone with heightened neural activity.

It worked.

He collapsed.

They dragged him into a van.

But just before the doors slammed shut ‚Äî Ben caught a glimpse of a chained prisoner being loaded into a black SUV nearby.

His dad.

Peter Parker.

Bruised. Bloody. But alive.

Ben screamed. Fought. Tore his restraints like paper.

And then he vanished into the night.


---

He didn‚Äôt win.

Not yet.

But now he knew.

Peter was alive. Fisk was scared.

And he was becoming something more than a punk with a cause.

He was a fuse.

And Chicago was about to burn.

You wake up, head to the kitchen, and that first wave of heat hits before you‚Äôve even touched the coffee machine. The air-conditioner‚Äôs been working all night, yet your space still feels sticky, warm, and off-balance. You wonder if the unit‚Äôs too small or faulty. But here‚Äôs the truth: your real issue might be hiding in the walls and ceiling.

When insulation is missing or poorly installed, your air-conditioning works overtime, your energy bills shoot up, and the comfort you expect stays just out of reach. And this happens quietly, day after day. That‚Äôs why partnering with an[ insulation company Singapore](https://excelinsulation.com.sg/) could be the smartest fix you‚Äôll ever invest in not just for your building, but for your wallet and peace of mind.

You don‚Äôt need to live in discomfort. And you certainly don‚Äôt need to accept rising bills as the price of staying cool. Here‚Äôs how insulation experts help you take back control, one area at a time.

# 1. Leaks That Drain More Than Air. They Drain Your Budget

You probably don‚Äôt walk around inspecting your window frames or ceiling corners every day. But that‚Äôs exactly where cool air escapes without you noticing. And when that happens, your air-conditioning system ends up working overtime just to make up for the loss.

Small cracks, gaps, and seams might seem harmless, but they‚Äôre costing you. These spaces allow outdoor heat to sneak in and your cooled air to leak out. It‚Äôs like filling a bucket with a hole at the bottom. You keep paying to maintain comfort that slips away.

A professional insulation team knows how to find and seal these weak spots. Using tools like thermal sensors, they trace where your building is bleeding energy. Then they seal it, reinforce it, and protect it. Once those leaks are under control, your cooling system doesn‚Äôt have to run as long or as hard. And just like that, your electricity bill starts easing back into sanity.

# 2. Real Insulation Works Even When You‚Äôre Asleep

Think of insulation as silent support. You can‚Äôt see it working, but you feel it. It wraps your home or building in a shield that keeps cool air in and heat out, all without moving parts or digital displays.

But here‚Äôs the problem. Not every building in Singapore has insulation that works the way it should. Some have outdated materials. Some were never designed to keep heat in to begin with. If your air-conditioning cycles constantly or never reaches the right temperature, that‚Äôs your clue.

When you bring in professionals who understand thermal insulation services, you‚Äôre not getting a one-size-fits-all fix. They assess your space, understand its needs, and apply the right solution for your structure. Whether it‚Äôs fibreglass batts, spray foam, or reflective foil, the goal is simple: make your space more efficient, with less work on your part.

# 3. Your Roof Might Be Turning Into a Heat Trap

You can‚Äôt control the sun. But you can control how much of its heat makes it into your home or business.

Under Singapore‚Äôs climate, rooftops soak up a significant amount of heat throughout the day. That heat then radiates inward, especially in upper-floor rooms or attic spaces. If you‚Äôve ever walked into a top-floor bedroom or workspace that feels ten degrees warmer than the rest of the building, this is why.

Roof insulation helps block that heat before it travels down. It reflects or absorbs the heat at the top level, preventing it from ever becoming your problem. This isn‚Äôt just for residential units, either. For commercial spaces or warehouses, partnering with industrial insulation contractors can result in major operational savings and far more stable indoor temperatures.

This isn‚Äôt just about feeling comfortable. It‚Äôs about protecting equipment, reducing wear on cooling systems, and making your entire structure work better from top to bottom.

# 4. Your Air-Con Is Tired and It‚Äôs Telling You

Listen carefully. If your air-conditioner has started making more noise, running longer cycles, or needing more repairs than usual, it‚Äôs probably under pressure.

When your space lacks proper insulation, your HVAC system becomes the only thing holding the climate together. That‚Äôs a lot to ask. It cools the room, then cools it again ten minutes later because the temperature won‚Äôt hold. That loop wears out even the best systems.

You can break that loop.

Good insulation eases the strain by keeping your space cooler for longer. When the cool air stays in and the outside heat stays out, your system finally gets a break. Even better, solutions like pipe and duct insulation solutions prevent energy loss in the very routes that carry cooled air throughout your building. This fine-tuning helps the system run smarter and stay healthy longer.

You‚Äôre not just saving on energy. You‚Äôre saving your air-conditioner from an early retirement.

# 5. Older Buildings Deserve Modern Efficiency

There‚Äôs something charming about an older building, the character, the design, the sense of history. But when it comes to energy efficiency, age isn‚Äôt always your friend.

Buildings constructed 15, 20, or even 30 years ago weren‚Äôt built with today‚Äôs cooling standards in mind. Insulation may be missing, thin, or degraded beyond usefulness. That beautiful flat or shop you love? It might be losing energy faster than you think.

But you don‚Äôt have to renovate the whole place to fix it. A trusted insulation company can step in and pinpoint where upgrades will make the biggest difference. That might involve injecting foam into hollow walls, upgrading ceiling materials for better thermal control, or installing reflective panels under the roof.

The goal is clear: transform an aging structure into an energy-efficient insulation property that feels as good as it looks without losing the charm that made you choose it in the first place.

# Comfort, Savings, and Peace of Mind. That‚Äôs the Power of Insulation

Insulation isn‚Äôt about fluff or filler. It‚Äôs about living and working in a space that feels right consistently. You shouldn‚Äôt have to adjust the thermostat every hour or worry about how much your utility bill will spike next month.

Good insulation helps take those worries off your plate. With the right solution in place, your space starts to work with your cooling system, not against it. And that changes everything.

Even your air-conditioning setup benefits. An experienced ACMV insulation specialist understands how air movement, heat zones, and ductwork all connect. Their work strengthens the weak points in your system so you use less energy, enjoy better comfort, and spend less money doing it.

# Ready for a Cooler, Smarter Future? You‚Äôre Not Alone

If your bills keep climbing or your space never feels quite right, it‚Äôs time to listen to what your building is trying to tell you. You don‚Äôt have to accept discomfort or rising energy costs as the new normal.

All it takes is a conversation with people who know where to look and how to help. When you work with an insulation company, you‚Äôre not just getting materials and labour. You‚Äôre getting insight, care, and solutions that actually stick because no one should have to overpay for basic comfort.

1meciur,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1meciur/the_degenerates_reference_manual_for_solo/,The Degenerate's Reference Manual for Solo Tapering (LONG POST ALERT),"### Foreword
First of all, if this post doesn't belong here, then mods feel free to delete.
I'm not offering recovery advice, just a detailed post that builds on existing CA survival literature.

I know that there are plenty of guides on tapering already, such as [Sip and Suffer](http://sipandsuffer.com) and a litany of wiki resources and posts on this subreddit. However, I figured that I'd add my own experiences and create a sort of reference manual on the different approaches to tapering, on different schedules, and with different medicines, as well as logistical concerns based on my own experience.
Everyone is different, so in the case of any anecdotal information, reconcile it with your own experience.

This guide serves as a reference manual to all things tapering; as such, I may (will) be repetitive and state the obvious many times. My goal is to be as detailed as possible in all the strategies I've had success with and provide auxiliary advice as well.

I know a lot of yall are resigned to your fate as CA, but this guide is just another post for those who want or need to cut down.

### Who is this guide for?
This guide is for people who are either too busy or unwilling to seek professional care, for whatever reason.
It's also intended for people curious about the mechanism of dependence and the different tools you have to taper safely and successfully.
This guide doesn't assume you want to stop drinking entirely. In fact, it's designed mostly for people who want to cut down just enough to not be on the verge of death or too drunk to function. 

### What assumptions does this guide make?
Firstly, it assumes your only problem is booze. If you have a problem with any other drug as well (other than weed or nicotine I guess), either don't follow this guide or adjust it to your needs. **DO NOT** follow anything here if you also have a benzo problem.

Secondly, it assumes you are otherwise healthy (especially your liver) and have no history of seizures or DTs in previous withdrawal episodes.

Thirdly, it assumes you are living in the United States.

Fourth, it assumes you are not very kindled.

Lastly, it assumes that you have no allergies to any of the drugs mentioned.

### Disclaimers
1. I am not a doctor, I am just an expert alcoholic who hates the medical system and never benefitted from therapy or meetings. **this is not medical advice**.
2. Everyone is different. You may be drinking more or less than I was, so the strategies included in this document may not fit you perfectly.

### Introduction
You may have heard from the internet, an AA meeting, a fellow alcoholic, or otherwise that *addiction/dependence is a disease*. This is true. Those who say this must also accept the corollary that addiction and dependence is a **solvable physiological problem**.
In light of this, if you are looking to taper, your goal is to treat your dependence like an optimization problem. Your baseline balance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is fucked because your main excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate was upregulated and your main inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, was downregulated during your daily drinking, setting them off balance when your BAC is too low.
Your baseline BAC required to balance these transmitters has been lifted to a local minimum (whether that's 0.08, 0.19, or 0.36, my personal record). Now in order to reach the global minimum (0 BAC needed to be normal), you must use any chemicals, including alcohol in some strategies, that you have on hand in order to shift your local minimum down to the global minimum by slowly decreasing the maxima.

### Section 1. The obvious. What to expect and nutrient requirements.
In the course of maintaining your CNS and minimizing seizure/DT risk with any of the strategies I mentioned, you need to keep the following in mind:

**It will suck**: That's the one thing you can't avoid. You'll be craving, shaking, and your heart will be beating like crazy.

**You'll want to drink**: No matter what your plans are after you get to baseline, you'll want a drink or five. You can have one or two if you think you'll drink like a normal person afterwards, but I recommend at least two weeks of complete abstinence to partially reset your tolerance and make that easier.

### Section 1a: Nutrients
As a CA, you'll need to keep the following in check:

**Thiamine (Vitamin B1)**: Take it every day. You're low on it and you don't want Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

**Magnesium**: Take 1000mg every day. Not only are you likely deficient in it, magnesium also helps stabilize your central nervous system. It'll make it easier to sleep and help just a bit with WDs.

**Folic Acid (Vitamin B9)**: Take it every day. Another essential nutrient you're deficient in.

**Blood sugar**: Keep it up or WDs will be worse. I recommend gatorade with sugar if you can't keep food down yet. Sip slowly if you can't keep liquids down easily either. Use Zofran or other antiemetics to assist with this.

### Section 1b. Food
If you've been drinking daily and all day (especially liquor), chances are your GI tract is both fucked by it and relies on it to function normally. However, you still must eat, even if the food is liquid.

Your best bet is once again to use Zofran to keep as much down as possible. If you don't have access, these two options are the best in my experience:

**Apple sauce**: Sugary, easy to digest. Bare minimum baby food.

**Bone broth with mashed potatoes mixed in**: High in carbs, nutrient-rich, liquid enough, and goes down easy.

When you feel like you can, attempt to progress to solid food again. Eat something high in carbs and comforting but soft, like pasta. Avoid vodka sauce if you're using antabuse to assist with a benzo taper though.

### Section 2. Strategies

### Section 2a. Classic alcohol taper
This is the most painful one and requires the most discipline, but the least resources. Refer to the sip and suffer manual in the foreword for instructions.

### Section 2b. Benzo-assisted alcohol taper
This is a derivative I have tried with success, but is also dangerous and requires just as much discipline, if not more. If done correctly, you can more comfortably taper much faster than you would with the classic taper. As the appendix says, **do not use valium, librium, or other intermediate/long acting benzos.**

You'll need access to the shortest-acting benzo possible, and the restraint to space your drinks as long as possible around the administration of your benzo. See Appendix A for details around benzos and usage instructions.

Basically, you do the following:
Follow the standard taper schedule. When you're ready and have the time, white-knuckle for as close to 12 hours as possible. Then, take one unit of the benzo you have and wait until it kicks in. If you still feel extremely terrible, take one more. After that, **do not drink for as long as possible.** You should endure ideally at least two half-lives of the benzo you took, or that of its longest-lived metabolite. You'll likely be able to sleep a bit more easily (especially if you combine with non-benzo drugs in Appendix B), and this makes it much less work to get through the taper.

I don't recommend this method if you're working while you taper, even if your job is remote. You'll forget things and sleep a lot, and generally be kinda dopey. You can try, but even if you manage to appear barely normal you'll be shit at your job. Unless you're gonna get fired, just take at least the first few days off.

### Section 2c. Chemically assisted alcohol taper (non-benzo)
This method allows you to taper off either more comfortably, more aggressively, or somewhere in between.
Refer to Appendix B for a list of drugs and instructions.

With this method, you utilize whatever you can get to control your CNS, minimize symptoms, and get back to baseline either comfortably or quickly.

I tried this successfully on an aggressive schedule (Decrease by 20-30% of my original drinks per day) with the following stack:

- 300mg Gabapentin 3x/day. Double-dose in the morning if the cortisol spike is really bad, and at other times if you really need it
- Two of those shitty gas station kava bottles spread out across each 24h period
- 1500mg Magnesium spread out across each 24h period
- Zofran an hour before each meal and whenever the morning cortisol-induced nausea kicks in
- 100mg Benadryl before bed
- 80ml Robitussin (Dextromethorphan) all at once before bed
- 6mg melatonin before bed

Because you may not be able to get all of these things, this strategy is very much customizable to your circumstances. Just make sure that you're drinking less each day by as much as possible/survivable.

### Section 2d. Benzo-only taper
If you've managed to somehow secure a substantial supply of either valium or librium, then you are a lucky man. This still kind of sucks on day 1 but it's the easiest method provided you don't drink; as such, I recommend augmenting it with disulfiram (antabuse) to take discipline out of the equation.
You can also combine it with the non-benzodiazepine drugs listed below to make it even easier - refer to Section 2c and Appendix B for further instructions.

Firstly, your goal is not to pop the pills like candy. Your job is to start with a proportionate dose of benzo to your drinking baseline after 12+ hours of no drinking, then taper off of the benzo.
Both librium and valium have a metabolite called nordazepam, which is what will do most of the work - it lasts 200+ hours and accumulates in your system. Day 0 and Day 1 are all about taking a big dose that starts that accumulation, and days 2-4 are about decreasing that buildup slowly. Refer to the table in Appendix A for instructions on a Librium taper. I have not tried this with valium, but given that nordazepam does most of the job, it's not unreasonable to try the same schedule with it.

### Section 2e. Changing plans mid-taper
You shouldn't do it. However, it is much more safe to switch from an alcohol-based taper to a benzo-only taper than the opposite.

For the former, you'll need to survive for about 12 hours before beginning the first benzo dose. If you can, take disulfiram the moment you're certain your BAC is 0. Start at the equivalent benzo dose of whatever day you got to, and throw out all your alcohol. Take the pain and stick to the new schedule.

For the latter, I recommend entirely against doing this. You literally may die; if you survive, your neurochemistry will be fucked. If you do it anyway, expect hell on earth. You'll need to wait until the benzos and metabolites are almost entirely cleared from your system, a process which can take longer than 24-48 hours, right when the possibility of seizures and DTs kick in. If you make it this far, get enough alcohol in your system to get a mild buzz going and then figure out your baseline.

### Section 2f. Tips and reminders
- Unless you're absolutely certain you're going to have a seizure and can't remedy it with alcohol during a taper, refrain from freaking out and taking a trip to the ER. They will keep you there as long as possible, fuck up your taper, and leave you with a fat bill whether you have insurance or not.
- Keep your medical information as compartmented as possible. Don't exactly go doctor-shopping because that will get you flagged, but avoid signing any disclosures and keep track of which doctors know you're a drunk.

### Section 3. Securing drugs and medicines
Some drugs are easier to get than others, but the most useful ones (benzos) are the hardest. This section is all about how to secure each class and ensure that the medical system doesn't flag you.

### Section 3a. Medical Privacy and Disclosure
Generally, you have a good deal of privacy under HIPAA and other protections. This means that doctors can't really go and gossip with each other and as long as you can remain normal for long enough, you can tell a physician, shrink, or other professional what they need to hear to prescribe. There is no central database of alcoholics unless you're a dumbass and sign the consent to retrieve medical records.

The only issue is the insurance company - they may get a claim containing a diagnosis code for alcohol use disorder. If this happens, then your life will be way harder. As such, I recommend paying out of pocket as much as possible for both appointments and meds if you have the means.

I will also note that the hospital system has more shared information. If you go to some ER in the same system as another ER you went to for WDs, they'll know.

### Section 3b. Securing benzodiazepines
Your best bet is to go to a cardiologist or a shrink with a ""panic disorder"". If you're persuasive and lucky, this will get you Xanax or Klonopin. If you go to a shrink, you'll probably need to go through a few weekly sessions and keep up the lie before they prescribe anything.
If you go to the right cardiologist with enough WDs, you might be lucky enough to walk out with a prescription. Explain to them that you have a panic disorder but you want to also get your heart checked out. I managed to get a bottle of xanax filled at the pharmacy right after my EKG was done.
If you're looking to get enough valium to get through a benzo-only taper, you'll have to get a severe anxiety disorder diagnosis. I have no experience in this matter, so good luck.
As for Librium, you're probably shit out of luck because nobody prescribes this for anxiety disorders anymore.

**Regarding buying off the street**: Don't do it. But if you do, have the fentanyl test strips ready and a dealer you trust like family. I have lost friends and family to overdoses before.

### Section 3c. Securing Zofran
Same thing as going to the doctor or shrink with an ""anxiety disorder"", but add that your anxiety attacks involve episodes of nausea and vomiting and that nothing OTC works. You should be able to get this or something similar more easily than the benzos.

### Section 3d. Securing Remeron
Go to the shrink and when it comes to the medication discussion tell them that you tried Prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft, but all the SSRIs gave you too many side effects and you don't like the loss of libido among other side effects. One of the things you struggle with is insomnia. Your friend said they tried Remeron and it worked wonders.

### Section 3e. Securing Gabapentin
You better have nerve pain. I have no idea how to get this otherwise. Sorry.

### Section 4. Post-taper
Once you're down to baseline, your goal is to reset your tolerance as much as possible. Whatever your goal is, whether it's complete abstinence, social drinking, or even just being a controlled FA again, you'll want to avoid alcohol for at least two weeks to get your tolerance back to normie levels.

If you want to drink only socially or just more like a normal person, set a hard cap of 1-4 drinks and stick to it. **Never drink every day**.

If you want to be an FA and drink daily, all I can say is it will be hard. Your tolerance will go up again, so you'll need constant discipline to avoid WDs.
Always spend as much time at 0 BAC as possible in between your drinking to keep your baseline low. Drink only after 5pm (ideally later), and let your system be at 0 BAC during the day. Endure the shakes if you get them because they'll be mild and otherwise harmless. If anyone at work asks, you either had too much coffee or you have a family history of Parkinson's disease.

### Conclusion
I hope this helps any of you fellow boozebags who want to cut down, even if you plan to just go back to drinking.

I know this has been long, repetitive and liberally stating the obvious for any newcomers.

Chairs.

### Appendix A. Benzodiazepines and usage instructions
Benzodiazepines are the gold standard of preventing WDs. The following is a non-exhaustive list of the different ones you'll encounter, their metabolic pathways, and how to use them.

**Caveat 1**: Benzos are all **controlled substances.** That means you'll need to be very persuasive, careful about medical record disclosure, and just plain lucky in order to secure a prescription.

**Caveat 2**: When using benzos to assist with an alcohol-based taper you must be extremely careful. Always use the smallest dose necessary, the benzo with the shortest half-life, and try to maximize the time you drink before and after administration of the benzo. Do it on an empty stomach if you can (or at least a meal with low/no fat), because it will shorten the duration of action and allow you to continue your alcohol taper schedule with lower risk of combining the two.

**Lorazepam (Ativan)**: Ativan is, in my experience, the shortest-acting ubiquitous benzo you'll be able to get. Problem is that it's extremely unlikely you'll ever be prescribed it, and hospitals typically administer it via IV. Unless you want to waste time and money in a hospital bed, I recommend you ignore this - you'll only get it if you freak out mid-WD and go to the ER.

**Oxazepam**: Although it's an excellent short acting benzo and has the added benefit of being easier on the liver, I have never heard of anyone being prescribed it so you'll likely only encounter it as a metabolite of diazepam (Valium) or chlordiazepoxide (Librium).

**Alprazolam (Xanax)**: Xanax is one of the easier benzos (technically triazolobenzodiazepine) to get prescribed. If you can secure a panic disorder diagnosis without getting flagged for a history of alcoholism, you have a good chance of getting this from a general physician, cardiologist, or shrink. Use this as a last resort for quick relief during a traditional alcohol taper to keep yourself steady, and go as long as possible before and after without an alcohol dose because you don't want a blackout and it does have a half-life of over 10 hours. And accept the fact that you'll probably sleep pretty heavy for a decent amount of time, which can be both good and bad.

**Clonazepam (Klonopin)**: Klonopin is also relatively commonly prescribed for anxiety disorders. Unlike Xanax however, its eliminination half-life is longer at up to 60 hours. As such, I'd be even more careful if you use this to augment an alcohol-based taper.

**Bromazepam (Lexotanil)**: This guide is for people in the USA, but if you're living in Europe this is a good short-term crutch to assist with an alcohol taper. Treat it like Xanax; its half life is 12-20 hours.

**Diazepam (Valium)**
Valium is also a pretty common benzo, usually prescribed for generalized anxiety disorder and insomnia. 
This one works great for WDs. It has a half-life of 50 hours and one of its metabolites is nordazepam, which has a half life of up to 200 hours. That means that if dosed correctly, it's a good alternative to Librium that can be secured outside of the context of addiction treatment.
You **should not** use this one to assist in an alcohol-based taper. You will get fucked up.

**Chlordiazepoxide (Librium)**: This one is the gold standard for non-alcohol tapers and is as such the default at every in-patient and out-patient treatment facility. While its own half-life is pretty short at 5-30 hours, like Valium it metabolizes to nordazepam (aka desmethyldiazepam), which like I mentioned has a half life of up to 200 hours.
I've managed to get my doctor to prescribe me it once for a solo taper, but it's unlikely you'll get it outside of a facility.
The ideal approach with depends on how much you've been drinking per day, but generally involves a loading phase (building up the metabolites in your bloodstream) followed by tapering off by 10mg per day.

A common taper schedule looks like this, if you've been drinking around 20 standard drinks a day and have enough librium to implement it. If you don't, scale the schedule to what you have and take the pain. Try to take it with a meal as all benzos are relatively lipophilic (dissolve in fats), therefore fat extends the duration of action:



| Day      | Schedule |
| -------- | -------- |
| 0     | 40mg at each meal time (breakfast, lunch, dinner. meal not necessary but ideal to extend action), and 40mg before bed     |
| 1     | 30mg at each meal time and 30mg before bed  |
| 2     | 20mg at each meal time and 20mg before bed |
| 3     | 10mg at each meal time and 10mg before bed |
| 4     | 10mg when you wake, and 10mg at dinner time or before bed |
| 5     | Nothing. You will still have nordazepam in your bloodstream that will slowly go away, so you can ride off the rest of the taper on that. |

Like Valium, **do not** use this in an alcohol-based taper.
If you find yourself too prone to drinking while on this schedule, do not try this without white knuckling for 12-16 hours then taking disulfiram (antabuse).

### Appendix B. Non-benzodiazepine drugs and usage instructions

**Gabapentin (Neurontin)**: In a pinch, this can also assist with alcohol-based tapers and has the benefit of not being a direct GABA modulator, meaning you can take it without planning it around alcohol doses during a taper.
It's pretty hard to secure unless you already have some kind of nerve pain or go to an outpatient clinic, but it's at least not a controlled substance.
Gabapentin's main function in the context of tapering is stabilizing your CNS. It works by reducing the release of glutamate, which allows your downregulated GABA to catch up. In short, it might not calm you down as much as a benzo but it'll keep the worst away and provide at least a bit of relief from the anxiety and shakes.
Take 300mg, three times a day.

**Mirtazapine (Remeron)**: This one is great for being able to sleep through mild WDs. It's technically an atypical antidepressant, so telling a shrink you've tried SSRIs and didn't like the side effects might work for getting this.
Another great effect of Remeron is that it makes you hungry, which helps you eat during WDs.
Take this before bed and you'll wake up hungry as fuck.

**Ondansetron (Zofran)**: This is a miracle drug for those of you who throw up all the time during WDs. It just shuts off that part of you that can throw up.
Securing it is as easy as saying that your anxiety or panic disorder also causes nausea and vomiting, and any OTC anti-emetics have not worked. However, it depends on your doctor/shrink, so results may vary.
Take it about an hour before eating, or whenever you start to feel the vomiting come on.

**Dextromethorphan**: Available OTC as Robitussin. Its sedative properties make it a good part of your sleep stack. In my experience, its cough-suppressing properties help avoid episodes of dry-heaving if you've already inflamed your esophagus from vomiting. It is also found in Mucinex and Nyquil, but avoid any formulation containing paracetamol or other NSAIDs - you don't want to fuck up your liver even more.
Take it before bed.

**Kavalactones (found in Kava)**: Kavalactones are a family of chemicals found in Kava, which can either be prepared from the root or found at your local gas station in drinkable form. The quality of the preparation may vary (usually dogshit but you have higher priorities right now), but nonetheless kavalactones modulate GABA, and thus reduce withdrawal symptoms. In my opinion it tastes like shit and upsets the stomach a bit, so administer zofran an hour before taking it.
Do not overdo it. One of those bottles combined with the rest of your stack should be enough to help. After that, you'll just get diminishing returns and possible hepatotoxicity (liver damage). 

**Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)**: An antihistamine that makes another good OTC part of your sleep stack. Its effects are barely noticeable on its own, but combined with the rest it's a decent complement.
Take 75-100mg (no more).

**Disulfiram (Antabuse)**: Blocks the activity of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, effectively making you violently hungover the moment you drink. Obviously don't use this in an alcohol-based taper, but if you decide on a librium or valium taper and lack discipline, this will help.
Make sure your BAC is at 0 (white knuckle for 12-16 hours) before first taking it, then take it every day you take the valium or librium.

# Prologue

**They say places like this hold space for healing. I'm not sure I believe that. Not right now.**

**The room is still. Too still. The kind of stillness that doesn't comfort ‚Äî it presses down, heavy and close. Machines blink and breathe for her, soft and steady, like they're whispering things I'm not ready to hear.**

**I sit here, watching. Waiting. Holding onto pieces of something that I'm afraid might not come back the same. Or at all.**

**It's strange how a person can change your world without meaning to. She didn't arrive like a storm or a spark. It was slower than that ‚Äî quieter. Like something shifting beneath the surface, just enough to make everything else tilt.**

**She didn't even know she was doing it. I'm not sure I knew either, not fully. There was no declaration, no perfect moment to name it. Only small things ‚Äî a glance that lasted too long, the way my voice softened around her, how my thoughts started to echo with her in them.**

**I told myself not to read into it. That it was nothing. That I could handle the not-knowing.**

**But I did know. Somewhere beneath all the caution and denial, I knew. And maybe she did, too. In her own way. But we never said it. We left it floating in the spaces between us, unfinished and uncertain.**

**Now I'm here, and she's there ‚Äî and everything we didn't say feels louder than anything we did.**

**I don't know if she'll remember. I don't know if I'll get the chance to tell her. And the idea that she might wake up a stranger to what we almost were... it's a kind of ache I don't have language for.**

**But even if the world forgets, even if she forgets, I won't. I'll hold the weight of it alone if I have to. Because it mattered. Because she mattered.**

**And maybe, just maybe, this isn't the end. Maybe this is just the place where the silence breaks. Where I stop waiting for the perfect moment and start choosing to speak, even if I'm the only one who hears it.**

**This story isn't simple. It never was.**

**But it begins ‚Äî and, in many ways, always returns ‚Äî with her.**

Chapter One: The First Draft

Kelsmore University had the kind of campus that looked like it had been ripped from a catalog ‚Äî all red-brick buildings, manicured hedges, and an endless supply of coffee carts humming in every courtyard. It was old, prestigious, and entirely too overwhelming for someone like me.

My name is Chloe Elise Hart. I was eighteen, freshly moved from the quiet suburbs just outside Santa Monica, and trying to disappear into the background of a program known for producing architectural prodigies and competitive perfectionists.

Most days, I felt like a smudge on blueprints I wasn't supposed to be touching yet.

Studying architecture at Kelsmore had been my dream since sophomore year of high school. It had always felt impossibly far away ‚Äî like something other people did. People with confidence, edge, the kind of voices that filled a room. And now, sitting on the grass outside the Department of Engineering and Architectural Studies, surrounded by older students who already looked like professionals, I wasn't so sure I belonged.

It was the second week of the semester ‚Äî that strange, in-between space where everything feels too new and not quite real yet. I kept my earbuds in, sketching quietly in my notebook, until a ripple of excitement passed through the group near the library steps.

""Is that Josie Everett?""

My pen froze.

I'd heard the name plenty in the past week. She was a senior ‚Äî and kind of a legend. Not just for her work, which people talked about like myth ‚Äî¬†*she designed a cantilever pavilion in her second year,*¬†someone whispered once ‚Äî but for the way she carried herself. Confident. Effortless. Charismatic in that maddening, unteachable way.

I looked up, and there she was.

Josie had short, messy dark hair tucked under a backwards cap, and wore a beat-up denim jacket covered in pins and paint stains. She was laughing with another senior officer from the department, clipboard in hand, like she owned the sidewalk and time itself.

""She's in architecture too, right?"" someone near me murmured.

I didn't answer. I just watched as she scanned the crowd, her eyes bright, her smile easy.

That was the moment. I wouldn't realize it for a while, but that was it. The second my story started to shift.

A few hours later, I was walking back to my apartment when I saw them ‚Äî Josie and a small group of seniors approaching groups of freshmen, inviting them to a casual get-together at a nearby bar. Not an official event, they clarified, just a relaxed night to welcome the newbies.

""Don't worry,"" one of them joked. ""No hazing rituals. We save that for the engineers.""

The group around me laughed. I didn't.

I'd never been good at parties. Especially not when I couldn't tell if I was genuinely welcome or if it was all just... part of some performance. I smiled politely, said I had other plans, and quietly slipped away, heart racing. I didn't want to be the quiet kid. But sometimes, safety wins over curiosity.

I was halfway to my apartment when I heard someone call my name.

""Chloooe!""

I turned and groaned. Adrean.

He was my only real friend on campus so far ‚Äî dramatic, loud, and allergic to solitude. He jogged up to me, cheeks flushed from too much excitement or possibly already a drink or two.

""Tell me you're going,"" he said breathlessly. ""The drinks thing. Everyone cool is gonna be there.""

""I don't think I'm cool,"" I muttered, glancing back the way I came.

He rolled his eyes. ""You're cool by association. You're friends with¬†*me*.""

""Adrean, I really don't think‚Äî""

""Come on, it's not a setup. I promise. No secret initiations, no 'drink until you pass out or you're out of the program' vibes. Just actual humans. Some of them hot. Some of them... Josie Everett.""

I looked away, heat rising in my cheeks. ""She's not‚Äî""

""She¬†*is*,"" he cut in with a grin. ""And she asked¬†*you*¬†to come.""

""No, she asked¬†*everyone*¬†to come.""

""Still counts.""

I hesitated. My heart thudded a little too hard in my chest. It wasn't just the party. It was the idea of being seen. Of being known. And maybe, of standing in the same room as someone like Josie and letting her look at me for more than a second.

""Fine,"" I mumbled, ""but I'm not staying long.""

Adrean fist-pumped the air like I'd just agreed to skydiving. ""That's the spirit!""

..............¬†**Adrean's apartment, 7:13 p.m.**

We weren't even supposed to meet until eight. But I showed up at Adrean's place around seven-thirteen, pretending I needed eyeliner. I didn't. I just needed to not be alone in my own head for another forty-five minutes.

He was in the bathroom doing... something with his hair for the third time. I flopped onto his bed and started scrolling through my phone, not really seeing anything. Just trying to look like I wasn't thinking about Josie. Which meant I was definitely thinking about Josie.

""She invited all the freshmen,"" I said loud enough for him to hear. ""Even the one who eats Cheetos with chopsticks.""

A pause. Then, from the bathroom: ""So?""

""So it's weird. She doesn't even like them.""

Adrean stepped into the doorway with a towel around his neck, still wet from the shower and already vaguely smug. ""Josie doesn't like anyone until they're obsessed with her. That's her whole thing.""

I locked my phone, stared at the ceiling. ""Do you think she's into girls?""

That made him stop. ""What?""

""Josie,"" I said, trying to sound offhanded and absolutely failing. ""Do you think she's experimenting or hiding or just... I don't know. Waiting?""

He tilted his head like I was a particularly confusing puzzle. ""Are we talking about Josie or are we talking about you?""

I sat up. Fast. ""Don't do that.""

""Do what?""

""That therapist voice. That annoying mirror trick. You're not clever.""

He folded his arms, leaned against the doorframe like he was in a coming-of-age movie. ""Okay. But I saw the way you looked at her last week. Like you were trying to memorize her.""

""She said my outfit was 'intense.' That's not a confession, it's barely a compliment.""

""You blushed.""

I got up and wandered over to his bookshelf, mostly to have somewhere else to look. Ran my fingers across the spines of all his fake-deep novels. ""And you think Leo's into you because he once asked what your favorite juice was.""

Adrean gasped like I'd insulted his entire bloodline. ""It was the¬†*way*¬†he asked.""

""He literally said, 'Do you want orange or apple.'""

""There was eye contact.""

I turned to face him, arms crossed. ""You do realize he's probably straight.""

""You do realize Josie is a chaos god who flirts with everything that breathes?""

We stared at each other. Said nothing for a second too long.

""Yeah,"" I finally said. ""But still. There's something off about her lately. Like she's performing too hard. Like... she's hiding something under all that cool.""

Adrean sighed and dropped onto the bed beside the messy pile of clothes he hadn't picked through yet. ""Aren't we all?""

I looked at him. Like,¬†*really*¬†looked at him. The one person who saw through me even when I didn't want to be seen.

""You'd tell me, right?"" I asked. ""If Leo ever‚Äîif something real ever happened?""

He met my gaze. And for once, he didn't turn it into a joke.

""Yeah. I'd tell you.""

I nodded. ""Me too. About Josie.""

He smiled, just a little. ""Even if she ruins you?""

""Especially if she ruins me.""

We sat in it for a moment‚Äîwhatever that was. The fear, the maybe, the both-of-us-not-saying-everything.

Then he held up the ugliest, sparkliest shirt I've ever seen. ""Okay, but seriously, can I wear this, or do I look like a disco divorcee?""

I snorted. ""You look like someone who has extremely specific Spotify playlists.""

""Perfect.""

We laughed. Too loud, too fast. Like we both knew what kind of night it might turn into, and neither of us were ready.

Outside, the city was starting to buzz.

Inside, the storm hadn't even started yet.

And just like that, I found myself walking toward the place where everything would begin. Not with fireworks. Not with fate screaming from the sky.

Just with a bar, a nervous heartbeat, and a girl I hadn't even spoken to yet ‚Äî but already couldn't stop noticing.

The place was called¬†**The Draft Room**¬†‚Äî an ironic name, given that the architecture and engineering students practically lived off drafts. Tonight, though, the seniors had rented out the entire bar, transformed it from a low-lit, industrial-style hangout into something warm and alive, buzzing with music, laughter, and the promise of forgetting about deadlines for a few hours.

Adrean and I were thirty minutes late.

Not because I insisted on being fashionably so, but because he refused to show up ""un-glammed and unworthy of attention,"" as he dramatically put it. He'd spent a solid hour fixing his curls, switching shirts three times, and even borrowing my cologne ‚Äî all in a thinly veiled mission to impress¬†**Leo Cruz**, a hot, tattooed mechanical engineering senior who just so happened to be in Josie's circle.

""You look like you're going to class,"" Adrean said as we stepped out of the rideshare, eyeing my oversized Kelsmore hoodie and baggy black pants.

""I¬†*was*,"" I replied, lifting my laptop bag in defense. ""I was literally supposed to be drafting our joint project today.""

He rolled his eyes. ""Well, you're about to draft a whole new identity. Fun Chloe. Party Chloe. Hopefully not panic-and-leave Chloe.""

I shot him a look, but I didn't disagree.

The second we walked into the Room, the volume of the night hit me like a wave ‚Äî chatter layered over music layered over glass clinks and bursts of laughter. The place was already packed, glowing with the soft amber light of pendant bulbs and wall sconces made from old steel piping. Everyone looked like they belonged. Everyone looked like they knew someone.

And then, across the room,¬†**Josie looked at me**.

She caught my eye before I even had time to process where I was. She was sitting in a booth surrounded by a group of seniors ‚Äî smiling mid-conversation, one hand wrapped around a drink, the other lazily twirling a straw. When her gaze found mine, her whole face lit up.

She raised her hand and waved me over.

""Chloe, right? Come sit here!"" she called.

My breath stalled for half a second. She remembered my name. She wanted me to sit with her. I barely registered Adrean muttering ""Well damn,"" beside me as we moved through the crowd.

The table was a mix of fourth-years and third-years, all loud and polished and intimidating in the way only students who had survived capstone projects could be. Josie scooted over and patted the spot beside her, smiling so brightly it felt... intoxicating.

""You made it,"" she said, like it mattered.

""Yeah, sorry ‚Äî we're late,"" I replied, sliding in awkwardly. ""Adrean had a glam crisis.""

""Rude,"" Adrean muttered, though he was already locking eyes with Leo across the table.

One of the seniors ‚Äî a girl with a septum ring and neon green nails ‚Äî raised her glass and grinned at me. ""Did you come straight from the library or something? You look like you're on your way to a¬†*study date*.""

A couple people chuckled. My face flushed.

""I was going to draft some project ideas after this, actually,"" I said, adjusting the strap of my laptop bag.

Josie gave a sharp look to her friend, holding up her hand like a traffic cop. ""Okay, let's ease up on the freshmen-roasting.""

The teasing quieted. Josie turned to me again and smiled, this time more gently.

""Listen,"" she said, tapping her glass. ""Tonight, we are¬†*not*¬†students. No deadlines. No studio. And definitely no architecture terms at the table.""

She looked around at everyone and raised her brows. ""Anyone says 'render,' 'load-bearing,' or 'conceptual massing' ‚Äî you drink.""

The table cheered in approval. Someone immediately yelled, ""Structural integrity!"" and took a dramatic shot.

I laughed ‚Äî genuinely ‚Äî for the first time since I arrived.

Josie leaned in slightly, lowering her voice just enough so only I could hear: ""Don't worry. I'll make sure you have fun. You're safe here.""

Something about the way she said it ‚Äî¬†*you're safe here*¬†‚Äî hit me in a way I wasn't expecting.

Because I wanted to believe it.  
Because maybe, for the first time in a long time, I did.

......................................................................................................................

*somewhere between restraint and collapse*

The Draft Room was half-empty, half-asleep.

Half the seniors had either stumbled home or passed out at the booths, and the rest were barely holding on. Adrean was long gone ‚Äî At some point between karaoke and his fourth attempt to flirt with Leo, he had disappeared ‚Äî possibly off to make out with someone in a hallway, possibly collapsed in a Lyft, possibly wandering the streets of Kelsmore narrating his own love life in Shakespearean soliloquy. It wouldn't be the first time.

Me? I was still here. Still slightly swaying, the tips of my ears hot and my limbs too light. I'd downed something fruity and neon and terrifying an hour ago, and now I was floating somewhere outside of rational thought. But Josie was still sitting beside me, impossibly composed after what had to be at least a hundred shots of gin.

She barely looked flushed. I, on the other hand, was practically melting into the wood grain of the table.

She scanned the scene and sighed.

""Everyone's dead,"" she said.

I nodded. ""You broke them.""

She smirked. ""Weaklings.""

She turned to me, brushing a piece of lint off her denim jacket. ""You wanna get out of here?""

I blinked. ""Get out... like go home?""

""Like go somewhere else.""

I hesitated. ""It's 1 a.m.""

""Time is fake.""

""I have a lab exam tomorrow.""

She raised an eyebrow. ""Is that a no?""

I don't know what it was about the way she looked at me ‚Äî maybe the tilt of her head, or the playful edge in her voice, or the fact that she asked me and not anyone else ‚Äî but I nodded before my brain caught up.

""Okay,"" I said. ""Screw the lab.""

She grinned like I'd passed some invisible test. ""Good girl.""

My stomach flipped like it had something to say about¬†*that*.

The club was thirty minutes from campus and felt like it existed in another universe entirely. Nothing about it was subtle. Not the name, not the neon lights, not the line of bodies outside swaying like flames in the bass-heavy wind. Inside, it was chaos wrapped in glitter.

People were dancing like they had nothing left to lose. Clothes clung to skin. Lights stuttered across faces like confessions. Everything was loud ‚Äî the music, the bodies, the heat, my pulse.

""This place is insane,"" I said as we squeezed through the crowd.

Josie laughed. ""It's the best.""

It wasn't my kind of place. It was too exposed, too alive, too unapologetic. But then she grabbed my hand ‚Äî just briefly ‚Äî to pull me through the crowd, and suddenly the room didn't matter.

We danced.

Or, Josie danced. I mostly tried to remember how my legs worked while she moved like the music had been written for her. She laughed when I tripped over someone's shoe. I laughed when she spun me into the wrong direction and nearly knocked over a drink. We were both drunk, both sweating, and it felt like I was breathing for the first time in months.

We collapsed into a booth in a cordoned-off VIP area after what felt like hours. A tall guy in designer clothes had waved us in. He clearly knew Josie ‚Äî or wanted to ‚Äî and sent over drinks like he was auditioning for her attention.

I didn't like him.

He kept looking at her like she was a prize to win. I stared him down like a warning label. Josie noticed and nudged me with her knee.

""Chill,"" she whispered. ""He's harmless.""

I didn't care. I didn't want anyone near her. I didn't want anyone else seeing her the way I saw her.

We sat close, legs barely brushing. Her drink rested between her palms, untouched. Mine was gone, though I had no idea when I finished it.

Somewhere in the quiet, she asked, ""Why'd you choose architecture?""

I blinked. The question caught me off guard.

""I like how buildings... hold things,"" I said slowly. ""Emotions. Memories. People think of them as cold and static, but they're not. They feel different depending on who's inside. You know?""

Josie turned toward me fully. ""That's beautiful.""

""It's kind of sappy,"" I muttered, suddenly embarrassed.

""Still beautiful.""

I paused. ""What about you?""

She looked away for a second, her smile dimming just slightly.

""I like control,"" she said. ""Architecture makes sense. Life doesn't. And... I guess I like the idea of shaping something permanent. Something that doesn't leave.""

Her words felt heavier than the music. Like something she hadn't said out loud before. I wanted to ask what she meant ‚Äî if something¬†*had*¬†left ‚Äî but she turned back and smiled again, shaking it off like mist.

""Anyway. I'm drunk and we're being deep,"" she said. ""Tell me something fun.""

I blurted: ""Why are you still single?""

Josie¬†*laughed*. Not a fake, flirty laugh. A real, belly laugh that made her shoulders bounce.

""Oh God,"" she said. ""That.""

I waited.

She looked into her glass. ""Guys like the way I look. But most of them don't really see me. They like the surface. The aesthetic. Not the person.""

I didn't know what to say. So I just... sat with it. Quiet.

And then she turned to me again. ""What about you? Why are¬†*you*¬†single?""

I should've lied.

I should've shrugged or made a joke or said something safe. But my mouth was already ahead of me, the alcohol loosening my spine.

""I'm gay,"" I said.

Josie blinked.

""And that's why I like you,"" I added, too fast, too bold.

Silence.

Immediate, deafening silence.

My brain lit on fire.

""I‚Äîwait‚ÄîI didn't mean‚Äî I¬†*meant*¬†it but not‚Äîlike not in a creepy way‚Äî""

Josie just smiled.

A real one. Soft and warm and untouchably calm.

""I love honest people,"" she said.

Then, gently, she leaned in and pressed a kiss to my cheek.

""I appreciate it.""

And just like that, I melted into the leather cushion, my heart exploding like someone had detonated fireworks inside my ribs.

She didn't pull away. She didn't flinch. She didn't treat me like I was broken or weird or anything other than¬†*brave*.

I turned my head, caught her eyes. Her smile held steady.

And all I could think was:

*This is going to ruin me.*

# Infinite Gastronomic Experiences to Satisfy Every Guest‚Äôs Craving

Secrets Baby Beach‚Äôs dining options will take you on a culinary journey around the world. With a diverse mix of local, Asian, Italian, and South American cuisines, you‚Äôll find a wealth of restaurants to explore. Slow mornings are best spent at Coco Cafe, coffee in hand, savoring premium brews, while evenings can be relished at Oceana, where you can indulge in the finest seafood on the island. After your meal has settled, a few cocktails at the Desire Music Lounge will be exactly what you need.

To mark the occasion, why not savor an exquisite meal together on the waterfront of Baby Beach? Or on those days when you feel like doing nothing and just want some alone time for the two of you, room service is only one call away.

# An Abundance of Exciting Activities to Enjoy at Your Leisure

Creating memories should be at the forefront of every honeymoon, and Secrets Baby Beach delivers a curated selection of activities to make that happen. Sample some fine vinos during a wine tasting led by a professional sommelier, or take a cooking class to learn how to whip up sushi alongside your other half. Beat the heat and get your exercise indoors at the on-site fitness center, or choose to head out and face it head-on for the day with a bike tour to discover new parts of the island.

Whenever you‚Äôve had your fill of resort life, embark on a day trip to see more of Aruba. Go deep underwater and get up close with the island‚Äôs marine life, or tear up some dirt going off-road on a thrilling adventure in a 4X4.

# Deluxe All-Inclusive Packages Covering All Your Needs Throughout Your Stay

When you‚Äôre on your honeymoon, the last thing you want to worry about is swiping your card here or there. To eliminate that concern, Secrets Baby Beach offers an elite all-inclusive experience where everything comes with your booking. Whether it‚Äôs meals at any of the restaurants or drinks at the bar, what you pay upfront covers it all, allowing you to fully focus on enjoying your first vacation as a married couple without thinking about money.

# State-of-the-Art Spa Facilities to Maximize Your Relaxation

Rest and rejuvenation should be at the forefront of your honeymoon, and the spa at Secrets Baby Beach grants just that. Restore your mind and soul using the plethora of facilities available in the pristine treatment areas. Soak in any of the saunas or steam rooms, or book a holistic session for some much-needed alone time. Get your hair or skin pampered in the full-service salon, which uses award-winning products that will leave you feeling brand new after the stress that comes with getting married.

# A Serene Beachside Location Where Paradise Comes Alive

Set on the untouched, curved Baby Beach, where crystal-clear waters gently crash onto glittering sands, Secrets lies in one of Aruba‚Äôs most prized locations. One look outside, and you‚Äôll be greeted by breathtaking vistas of the ever-glowing Caribbean Sea, just steps away from the public areas, where visitors have the opportunity to settle onto a sun lounger and watch the world go by with their other half. Even though the waters at Baby Beach are somewhat shallow, it‚Äôs still a prime place for snorkeling, as there can be some sea turtles and small rays floating around at certain times.

# Calm Pools That Welcome You for a Gentle Swim

After a long day, there‚Äôs nothing more satisfying than a relaxing soak in the swimming pool. At Secrets Baby Beach, you‚Äôll have three different options to choose from: the main social pool where guests can mingle, the infinity pool overlooking the ocean with the soothing sound of crashing waves, and, for members, an exclusive members-only pool for added privacy. Surrounding the pools are Bali-designed cabana beds, which you can reserve at the front desk. If you prefer to warm up instead of cooling off, the two outdoor hot tubs are always a great idea before evening time.

# Start Your Forever Together on Aruba‚Äôs Stunning Shores at the Opulent Secrets Baby Beach

Secrets Baby Beach may be a relatively new addition to Aruba, but its high level of luxury provides the ideal backdrop for any couple who has recently married and needs to recharge their batteries.

Sounded promising since lots of coffee shops like Analog, Monogram, Deville, etc are in these ones. But it is not what we expected...

Here‚Äôs what it really is:

You give out free coffees to people who buy their pass.

You only make money if you sell the pass yourself. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just giving away drinks for free, losing money on product and labor.

The ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù they promised? One social media video. No real reach, no new customers.

And to top it off, many of the people using the pass have been rude or entitled (I get it, it's a free drink but that doesn't give you the right to act like that).

No pay. No exposure. Just expenses and headaches.

TLDR: Coffee pass sounded like good promo, but turned out to be a money-losing deal with no real marketing and entitled customers. Only way to make anything is if you sell the pass. Not worth it for small caf√©s. ",47,1753992903.0,Calgary,6,0.87,False

Before kids, I contributed financially, and after kids, we agreed to divvy up the roles as we did woth me at home and him working. He is an incredible man.

I actually don't mind the work that I do at home but... no matter how much he reassures me that we are each sharing the load well... I feel so guilty.

I feel guilty for not bringing home the extra money we could use to pay off debts, instead of just scraping by. 

I feel guilty that he works so much and I get to spend every day with our kids, and he only gets that on the weekend. 

I feel guilty even when I get to eat something special at home when we went shopping, because he is at work and gets lunch provided, but since he is gone, I will then eat the fruit we bought, or have a slice of cake, or have a nice iced coffee I made.
