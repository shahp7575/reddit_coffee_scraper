1qa3b9a,https://i.redd.it/d7j72ynyvqcg1.png,Strange but true: Tomato juice as a pre-game focus boost,"This might sound dumb, but I’ve been drinking a glass of tomato juice followed by a glass of water before playing CS2, and it’s been helping me a lot. It gives me a clean, awake feeling (not jittery like coffee), and my aim and reactions feel more consistent. I’ve been hitting more shots and I don’t get as tired during longer sessions.

One possible reason is that tomato juice has a good amount of potassium and other electrolytes. Those are involved in basic things like hydration and how nerves and muscles function, so maybe being a bit better hydrated and balanced just makes it easier to stay sharp and steady. Or it could just be the ritual itself putting me in the right mindset.

Probably placebo, but it’s become part of my pre-cs2 routine. Anyone else have weird rituals like this, or specifically tried tomato juice before games?",1,1768148077.0,cs2,0,1.0,False

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like you're just going through the motions, or that there's *more* you could be doing with your time and energy? You're not alone. We're all on this journey to become the best versions of ourselves, and sometimes we just need a little nudge, a fresh perspective, or a practical tip to keep climbing.

Think about it: what if you could systematically, intentionally, and joyfully upgrade your life? It's not about radical, overnight changes. It's about small, consistent shifts that compound over time.

Here are a few thoughts that have been rattling around my brain lately, things that have helped me feel a bit more… optimized. Maybe they’ll spark something for you too.

*   **Morning Rituals Aren't Just for the Instagrammers:** Seriously, what you do in the first hour can set the tone for your entire day. I'm not talking about an hour of intense meditation (though if that’s your jam, go for it!). It could be as simple as:
    *   5 minutes of stretching.
    *   A glass of water *before* coffee.
    *   Jotting down 3 things you're grateful for.
    *   Listening to an uplifting podcast on your commute.
    The key is intentionality. What small act of self-care can you weave in *before* the world demands your attention?

*   **""Deep Work"" is Your Superpower:** In a world of constant notifications and distractions, the ability to focus deeply on one task is incredibly valuable. This means setting boundaries. Turn off notifications, close unnecessary tabs, and dedicate blocks of time to that one thing that truly matters. What's one task you've been putting off that requires your full, undivided attention?

*   **Embrace ""Good Enough"" Sometimes:** Perfectionism can be a sneaky thief of progress. It's better to finish a good project than to have a perfect, unfinished one. When can you give yourself permission to release the need for absolute flawlessness and just get it done?

*   **Listen to Your Body (And Your Mind!):** Are you running on fumes? Our physical and mental well-being are the bedrock of everything. Pushing through exhaustion is rarely a sustainable strategy. Are you getting enough sleep? Moving your body in a way that feels good? And importantly, are you giving your mind breaks? Sometimes the best ""optimization"" is simply rest and rejuvenation. If you're struggling with stress or feeling overwhelmed, it's okay to seek support. You don't have to navigate these challenges alone. Consider exploring [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame) for some guidance.

*   **Curate Your Input:** What information are you consuming? Is it uplifting and inspiring, or draining and demotivating? Be mindful of the books, articles, podcasts, and even the people you surround yourself with. Are you actively seeking out things that nourish your mind and spirit?

These are just a few ideas, and what works for one person might not work for another. The magic happens when you experiment, observe, and adapt.

What are some of your favorite life optimization hacks? What small changes have made a big difference in your day-to-day? Let's share and learn from each other! 👇",1,1768148048.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

SHORT VERSION of the story:

Technically, this wasn't a breakup, but it hit me just as hard.

About a year ago I met a girl on a language app. We clicked instantly, talked every day for \~2-3 months with huge chemistry (shared music, hobbies, life stories, some subtle flirting). She mentioned early on she had a boyfriend, but it never felt like a hard boundary. I was 25-30 and she was 6 years younger.

We even met in her city – what was supposed to be just coffee turned into 10+ hours together, great vibe, no physical stuff. Contact got even more intense after when I got back to my country.

It was smooth until she mentioned a fight with her boyfriend. I tried to support her neutrally (“if you're doing things important to you, don't worry”) and gave some advice. After that – complete ghosting. One month later she apologised briefly for disappearing, I replied calmly, not overly enthusiastic though… and ghosted again. Forever.

It wasn't a relationship, but the closeness and daily intensity felt like one. The worst part: not even one sentence like “sorry, I can't continue”. Just vanished.

It hurt a lot and changed how I see people/connections.  
Would appreciate outside perspective: what really happened here? How to classify this kind of thing? Why do people behave like his?

Thanks for any thoughts.

**TL;DR:** Met a girl on a language app, built intense daily chemistry for 2–3 months with flirting and an IRL meetup, she casually had a boyfriend, ghosted me forever after I gave neutral advice during her fight with him—no explanation, no closure.

Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because we are hitting a wall with our puppy and are very worried. We have a **4-month-old Male German Shepherd** (Captain Jean-Luc Picard) who has been dealing with bloody urine (hematuria) for weeks. I lost my last dog to kidney disease, so the recent lab results have me terrified.

**The Timeline:**

* **Dec 20 -- First Vet Visit:** He started peeing blood. We took him to the vet, confirmed a UTI via urinalysis (bacteria and RBCs present).
   * **Bloodwork abnormalities:**
      * **High Glucose:** 126 mg/dL (Normal: 60-110) – vet suspected stress.
      * **High Phosphorus:** 10.8 mg/dL (Normal: 2.9-6.6) – vet noted this is normal for a growing puppy.
      * **Low Globulin:** 1.8 g/dL (Normal: 2.3-5.2).
      * **CBC Flags:** Low MCV (52 fl) and High RDWc (33.1%).
   * **Treatment:** Prescribed **Clavamox (Round 1)**.
* **Dec 20–26 -- The Success:** The blood cleared up completely while he was on the meds. We thought we were in the clear.
* **Dec 27 -- Urgent Care Relapse:** About 2 days after finishing the pills, the bloody urine returned. We went to Pet Specialists Urgent Care.
   * **Urinalysis:** RBC 6-20/HPF.
   * **Culture:** Sample taken via cystocentesis.
   * **Treatment:** Started **Clavamox (Round 2)**.
* **Dec 27–31 -- No Improvement:** He was still on Clavamox, but there was no change in the bloody urine. The vet suggested an ultrasound and prescribed **Carprofen**.
* **Jan 2 -- Ultrasound Results:**
   * **Findings:** ""Thickened bladder wall"" (0.3 cm) consistent with cystitis. ""Thick medullary rim"" on kidneys.
   * **Status:** He finished the second round of Clavamox, but was still peeing dark brown/red urine. The culture from Dec 27 came back **NEGATIVE**.
* **Jan 6 -- Vet Follow-up:** Still peeing a ton of red urine. Because the culture was negative, they suspected **Sterile Cystitis** and prescribed **Meloxicam**.
* **Jan 6–7:** On Meloxicam with no change. Urine remained very dark/bloody.
* **Jan 8 -- Vet Hospitalization:** We brought him in because his morning urine was ""coffee colored.""
   * **Treatment:** The vet noted dehydration and put him on IV fluids for the day.
   * **Key Labs (Ran Jan 8, results received later):**
      * **UPC (Protein/Creatinine Ratio): 4.8** (Very High - normal is <0.5).
      * **SDMA (Kidney Marker): 16.8** (High - normal is <14).
   * **Plan:** The vet mentioned trying **Adequan** (off-label use to help heal bladder lining) at the next visit.
* **Jan 8–10:** Fluids seemed to help slightly; urine turned dark yellow with blood at the end, rather than fully mixed.
* **Jan 11 -- ER Visit:** When I got the high UPC/SDMA results back from Jan 8th, I panicked, so we went to the ER.
   * **New Bloodwork abnormalities:**
      * **Low Phosphorus:** **<0.2 mg/dL** (Normal: 2.9-6.6) – This was a massive drop from his previous test but they said it could be a misreading and will run again.
      * **Low Total Protein:** 5.4 g/dL (Borderline Low).
      * **Low Globulin:** 1.7 g/dL (Normal: 2.3-5.2).
      * **CBC Flags:** Low MCV (57 fl) and High RDWc (31.8%).
      * *Note:* BUN and Creatinine (0.7) were normal on this visit.
   * **Urinalysis Discrepancy:** Manual review said ""None to Rare"" bacteria, BUT the AI machine (Vetscan Imagyst) flagged **massive amounts of bacteria** (Cocci: 33-184).
   * **Plan:** The ER vet prescribed **Cefpodoxime**, suspecting the bacteria are still there despite the conflicting count.
   * **Referral:** We got a referral for an **Internal Medicine Specialist**.

Current Status:

We are waiting on:

1. Results of the **CK (Creatine Kinase)** test.
2. Results of the **Second Culture** (taken Jan 11).
3. Results of rerun for Phosphorus. 
4. Vet appointment tomorrow (Jan 12) to discuss Adequan.
5. Internal Medicine appointment (waiting to hear back).

**Questions:**

* Has anyone dealt with a ""Negative Culture"" that turned out to be a hidden/resistant infection (like the AI machine suggests)?
* Does this appear more structurally related, kidney related, or UTI related? 
* Has anyone used **Adequan** for bladder issues in dogs?
* With the ""rebound"" pattern (worked once, then failed), does this sound more like a resistant bug or a structural issue?

Any advice is appreciated!

1qa38k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1qa38k1/how_to_be_unforgettable_the_science_of_emotional/,How to Be UNFORGETTABLE: The Science of Emotional Impact That Actually Works,"Let me hit you with something wild: most people you meet will forget you in about 24 hours. Not because you're boring, but because our brains are wired to filter out the mundane. We're drowning in faces, names, and small talk. But some people? They stick. They leave a mark. They become unforgettable.



I spent months diving into research on memory, neuroscience, and human connection (books, podcasts, psychology papers, the whole deal) because I wanted to crack this code. Turns out, being memorable isn't about being loud or trying too hard. It's about creating emotional impact. When you trigger emotions in people, you literally change their brain chemistry. Their amygdala fires up, cortisol or oxytocin gets released, and boom, you're encoded into their long term memory.



The best part? This isn't manipulation or some fake charisma bullshit. It's about genuine connection and understanding how humans actually work. Here's what I learned.



 Step 1: Stop trying to impress people



This sounds backwards but hear me out. When you're trying to impress someone, you're performing. You're focused on yourself, your words, how you look. People can smell that desperation from a mile away.



Instead, make them feel something. The neuroscientist Antonio Damasio found that emotions are the core of decision making and memory formation. People won't remember what you said, but they'll remember how you made them feel. Cliche? Maybe. But it's backed by decades of research.



Practical moves:



 Ask questions that actually matter. Not ""what do you do?"" but ""what's been taking up most of your headspace lately?"" or ""what's something you're weirdly passionate about?""

 Listen like you give a damn. Put your phone away. Make eye contact. Nod. React. Show that their words are landing.

 Share something real about yourself, not just surface level stuff. Vulnerability creates connection.



 Step 2: Be the anomaly, break patterns



Our brains are prediction machines. They love patterns because patterns save energy. But when something breaks the pattern? That's when attention spikes. That's when memories form.



Think about it. You remember the weird professor who taught class in costume. The friend who texted you at 3am with a random life question. The stranger who complimented something specific about you, not just ""nice shirt.""



The book ""Made to Stick"" by Chip and Dan Heath breaks this down beautifully. They call it the ""unexpectedness principle."" When you violate expectations in a positive way, you become sticky in people's minds. This book is insanely good at explaining why some ideas (and people) stick while others fade. It's based on years of research into memorable communication.



How to apply this:



 Do something slightly unexpected in conversations. If everyone's complaining about Monday, talk about what you're genuinely excited about.

 Send voice notes instead of texts sometimes. It's more personal and catches people off guard.

 Remember tiny details people mention and bring them up later. ""Hey, did your sister's interview go well?"" That specificity hits different.



 Step 3: Create peak moments



Daniel Kahneman won a Nobel Prize for his work on memory and experience. His research shows we don't remember experiences as a whole, we remember peaks (the best or worst moments) and endings. This is called the peak end rule.



If you want to be unforgettable, you need to create peak moments with people. Not every interaction needs to be profound, but sprinkle in moments that spike emotions, good or bad (preferably good, obviously).



Try this:



 End conversations on a high note. Don't let things fizzle out. Leave them with a laugh, a thought provoking question, or genuine enthusiasm.

 Do small unexpected things. Buy someone their coffee when they're not looking. Send an article that made you think of them. Show up when they need help.

 Be present during important moments. If someone's celebrating or struggling, be ALL there. No half assed attention.



 Step 4: Tell stories that hit the feels



Facts tell, stories sell. But more importantly, stories stick. Your brain processes stories differently than random information. When you hear a good story, your brain releases oxytocin (the bonding hormone) and multiple regions light up. You're not just listening, you're experiencing.



""The Storytelling Animal"" by Jonathan Gottschall dives deep into why humans are wired for narrative. We've been telling stories around fires for thousands of years. It's how we make sense of the world and connect with each other. This book will make you question everything you think you know about human communication.



Make your stories work:



 Use sensory details. Don't just say ""I was nervous."" Say ""my hands were shaking and I could feel my heartbeat in my throat.""

 Have a point. Stories without a takeaway or emotion are just rambling.

 Make it about them, not you. Frame your stories so the listener sees themselves in it or learns something they can use.



 Step 5: Master the art of presence



This is the hardest one but the most powerful. Most people are physically present but mentally elsewhere. They're thinking about their next meeting, what to say next, or scrolling through mental to do lists.



When you give someone your full, undivided attention, it's like a drug. They feel seen. They feel valued. Research from Harvard shows that people spend 47% of their waking hours thinking about something other than what they're doing. When you're that rare person who's actually THERE? You stand out.



Tools that help:



 Try the Headspace app for mindfulness training. Being present is a skill you can practice. It teaches you to quiet the mental noise and focus on the now.



 BeFreed is an AI-powered learning app that turns high quality book summaries, research papers, and expert talks into personalized audio content based on what you want to learn. Built by a team from Columbia University, it pulls from verified sources to create custom podcasts tailored to your goals.



What makes it useful here is the adaptive learning plan feature. You can tell it you're working on social skills or presence, and it'll build a structured plan pulling from multiple sources. You customize the depth too, anywhere from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. Plus there's a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with mid-podcast if something clicks and you want to explore it further. For anyone serious about continuous growth without the overwhelm, it's worth checking out.



 Put your phone on Do Not Disturb during conversations. Seriously. The mere presence of a phone on the table reduces conversation quality (actual research from the University of Essex).

 Practice active listening. Repeat back what you heard. ""So what you're saying is..."" It shows you're processing, not just waiting to talk.



 Step 6: Show up consistently



One amazing interaction won't make you unforgettable long term. Consistency does. The mere exposure effect (researched by Robert Zajonc) shows that people develop preferences for things simply because they're familiar with them.



But here's the key: consistent doesn't mean boring. It means reliably being that person who brings energy, authenticity, or support.



Consistency moves:



 Check in on people without needing something. ""Thinking of you"" texts hit different.

 Show up to things you said you'd show up to. Reliability is sexy.

 Be consistent in your values and how you treat people. Trust builds over time.



 Step 7: Leave them better than you found them



This is the ultimate move. Every interaction should leave the other person feeling slightly better about themselves or their day. Not in some fake toxic positivity way, but genuinely.



""The Charisma Myth"" by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks down how charismatic people make others feel powerful and valued. It's not about the charismatic person being impressive, it's about making others feel good in their presence. The book is full of science backed techniques on presence, power, and warmth. Best charisma book I've ever read, hands down.



Final moves:



 Compliment specifics, not generics. ""You explained that really clearly"" beats ""you're smart.""

 Celebrate people's wins genuinely. No jealousy, no comparison. Pure hype.

 Offer value without expecting anything back. Share knowledge, make introductions, give help freely.



Look, becoming unforgettable isn't about performing or putting on a show. It's about tapping into what makes us human: emotions, stories, connection, presence. The science is clear. When you trigger positive emotions and make people feel valued, you literally rewire their brains to remember you.



Most people sleepwalk through interactions. Be the person who wakes them up. Be the anomaly. Create those peak moments. And watch how quickly you become someone people can't forget.

To live on the bare minimum, on the crumbs that other people throw at me. To feel on the bare minimum, from the happiness a simple word, a message, gives me. I want to escape this feeling of emptiness, of being just for the sake of being, of thinking just for the sake of thinking, of existing just for the sake of existing.

Many people go through similar things, I have no right to complain, I have no right to cry, I have no right to die. However, I want to complain, I want to cry but I will not die, because I want to escape.

Sometimes I’m only looking for two words. I just want those two words to be for me, to come from you, not from me. Because when I tell them to myself, they don’t work, I don’t believe them, I need someone else to help make me believe them.

I’m fine. I understand. I get it. I want to be there for everyone. I overthink, I analyze, did I do something wrong? What could this or that mean? Are you okay? You don’t look okay.

I just want those two words, I want to hear them, I want you to take my hand, hold my shoulder and, while you look at me, for them to come from you.

Are we all like this? I should say them too. But honestly, does anyone care if I say them? No one asks for help, no one wants to look like this, no one wants to be seen like this.

I am not a priority for anyone. Short messages, read messages that don’t get answered, attempts at small openings that are not reciprocated.

I am the clown, the friend who is only good for meeting up with, laughing, having a coffee and leaving. Why does no one trust me? Why am I only good as a momentary distraction? I want to be more than that. I can be more than that.

“You’re a really cool guy.” That’s not enough for me. If I’m so cool, why am I only good for you to write a laugh in a message from time to time?

What can it cost, how long can it take? It’s just two words, you can say hundreds in less than a minute. Why have I never heard them?

Do I close myself off from the world because the world closes itself off from me, or does the world close itself off from me because I close myself off from it?

I do need something more, I’m not going to hold on like this for the rest of my life; I refuse. The automatic response that everyone carries and few people stop to question.

We all see, but we never look. We all hear, but we never listen. An automatic “fine” to “How are you?” is not fine, sometimes it hides a “bad” and other times it hides a ""help"".

Many of us carry that, because we don’t want to bother others. We don’t want to be seen as vulnerable and we are not strong enough to take off that mask.

I am not okay. I am still waiting for those two words. I want someone to tell me that I am, I want someone to tell me,

I had my second 0.25 shot on Friday, and since Saturday I’ve had almost no desire to eat. I’ve actively changed the way I cook (more protein, vegetables, and grains). For example, yesterday I had breakfast at 8 a.m.: two shop-bought crêpes with apple filling. I didn’t have lunch until 3 p.m., which was mixed grains, vegetables, and some lean pork. I wasn’t hungry at all, but got protein Yogurt as dinner. How is that possible? Is this really how this medication works?

Today for breakfast I had two chickpea–tahini–whey cookies with coffee, and for lunch a salad with grilled chicken and a few potato skins from a kit. I also had a sugar-free matcha latte with one white Oreo and still wasn’t hungry. When I count calories, it comes to around 1,000–1,200 kcal.

Should I be eating more to avoid putting my body into starvation mode? Or does GLP prevent that? My next call with the doctor is only in two weeks.

SHORT VERSION of the story:

Technically, this wasn't a breakup, but it hit me just as hard.

  
About a year ago I met a girl on a language app. We clicked instantly, talked every day for \~2-3 months with huge chemistry (shared music, hobbies, life stories, some subtle flirting). She mentioned early on she had a boyfriend, but it never felt like a hard boundary. I was 25-30 and she was 6 years younger. 

We even met in her city – what was supposed to be just coffee turned into 10+ hours together, great vibe, no physical stuff. Contact got even more intense after when I got back to my country.

It was smooth until she mentioned a fight with her boyfriend. I tried to support her neutrally (“if you're doing things important to you, don't worry”) and gave some advice. After that – complete ghosting. One month later she apologised briefly for disappearing, I replied calmly, not overly enthusiastic though… and ghosted again. Forever.

It wasn't a relationship, but the closeness and daily intensity felt like one. The worst part: not even one sentence like “sorry, I can't continue”. Just vanished.

It hurt a lot and changed how I see people/connections.  
Would appreciate outside perspective: what really happened here? How to classify this kind of thing? Why do people behave like his?

Thanks for any thoughts.

  
DETAILS:

Technically, this wasn't a breakup, but it hit me just as hard.  
I'd like to share the story and hear your thoughts, because ruminating alone and making up all kinds of assumptions without being able to talk it through with anyone is really messing with my head.

About a year ago I met a girl on a language app – I was super passionate about improving my favorite language. I started the conversation, we clicked immediately, and the next day she actually texted me back (which almost never happens on those apps). We kept talking, she casually mentioned she had a boyfriend (not as a boundary, just said he was the same age as me).

The chemistry was insane – similar music taste, tons of shared hobbies, everything just flowed. Then a friend of mine (from her country, total coincidence) suggested a trip to the city where she lived, so I invited her for coffee. She agreed, we switched to WhatsApp, met up… and what was supposed to be a quick coffee turned into 10+ hours of walking around the city, talking non-stop. Great vibe, no touching or anything physical, just pure connection.

We said goodbye, but I was still in town the next day. She joked about not being able to send the coffee money online and said “or cash lol” – I didn’t catch what she was hinting at back then. Anyway, I suggested another walk and we spent the evening in a park after dark. I was honestly surprised she felt safe doing that with a guy 6 years older from another country whom she’d only known for 10 days, but I guess the first day’s vibe was that strong and I’d been very open about myself.

After that the contact got even more intense – basically constant conversation for almost 2 months. We shared life stories, she sent me singing videos, party photos, everything. A few times she dropped something that was clearly intelligent flirting, but I completely missed it because “she has a boyfriend” was stuck in my head. I didn’t realize how much the sheer level of engagement already meant.

Then one day she mentioned she’d argued with her boyfriend (first time he came up since the very beginning – something about not spending enough time together). I didn’t really know how to respond, so I said something like “if you’re doing things that are important to you, you shouldn’t worry” and started giving some life advice (I try not to do that anymore unless someone asks for it).

After that message – total ghosting. Nothing for a month. I didn’t chase, just gave her space.  
When I was finally starting to accept that our “friendship” was over, she popped up with a short “sorry for disappearing, how are you?”. I replied neutrally (not cold, but not super excited), asked the same… and ghosted again. Forever.

I still can’t wrap my head around how someone can be that close to another person for months (short but extremely intense and energetic) and then just vanish without a single sentence.  
It was brutal. Even though it wasn’t romantic, it hurt like hell. One simple “sorry, I can’t continue” would have made a huge difference – I would’ve understood.

I’d really appreciate an outside perspective:  
What do you think was actually going on from her side?  
How would you classify this kind of connection?  
And how do people just disappear like that after months of daily deep talks? It really shook my view of how humans treat each other.

We are going to be Hawaii for 12 days. We are a young couple and I will be 25 weeks pregnant at the time, but we are very active (hopefully I still will be by then!) and prefer activities/experiences to sightseeing but want to still have balance. I LOVE snorkeling, the ocean, and wildlife and want to get a ton of that in, we have our own gear. I know some of the days I have planned are super packed, but I'm having a hard time planning by area and figuring out where to stay. I also have two days unplanned between the two island so need to figure out where to spend those before booking the internal flight. We plan on having a rental car. We like being busier than most people do, but still want to keep things realistic.

Please let me know if my itinerary is insane, if anything you think that would appeal to us is missing, and how we might utilize the two unplanned days even if its just spreading out our current itinerary.

She latched onto me the first week I started (June). I bought her a coffee from Starbucks because she had loudly exclaimed that she forgot her debit card while in the break room as she rummaged through her purse frantically, and as I was going there anyway, she tagged along and I paid for her drink too. That was the start…she began a cycle of needing a ride because she had car trouble, not having enough money for lunch, so I’d share mine. I tried to distance myself, ignoring her texts as the favors became literally daily. Then her mom died (August). I felt so bad so I started packing 2 lunches and would buy her small treats like a candy bar or a muffin (this lasted about 3 months).

She was distraught constantly to the point she would sob at any given moment. In December she went on a date with a guy she liked from her college so I didn’t see or hear from her until yesterday. She caught him stealing money from her purse, and worst of all, it was to take another girl out. She said she knew they weren’t exclusive but she still considered him her boyfriend. 

Sobbing, boogers, the whole ugly bit. I really felt conflicted because, yeah that’s horrible, but I was really fed up and to be honest I don’t even consider her a friend. We don’t talk about anything but her many many many many problems. I was pretty honest with her, and told her how I felt, I pointed out that he wasn’t really her boyfriend because he never said he was, and most importantly, she needs to get her life together. I told her to focus on her school and career and becoming mentally stable. I even suggested therapy. She flipped out and called me a bunch of names and cried even more.

1qa2oqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MelissaRovellibooks/comments/1qa2oqd/release_me_a_sample_of_my_book/,"Release Me, a sample of my book","**Chapter 2** 

Sitting on the plaid living room couch with my sister watching TV, the night began ordinary enough. Curled up beside me was Golden haired Anna, rapt in the mystery occupying our brains. I think it was a re-run of Nancy Drew, and I was antsy. It was summertime and I remember it being hot. Our apartment had few windows and an ancient air conditioner. Though I liked the heat, I hated the south's humidity. 

My attention strayed around the room. Dad was reclining in his Lazy Boy reading a history book and sipping coffee, while Mom was cleaning up in the drab green kitchen. We were a typical 1970's family who ate dinner on TV trays. This should have never happened to us. 

*Vieve!* 

Did something call me? The hair on the back of my neck stood on end. 

I suddenly had the urge to get up. Under a spell, I rose. Even though I had no personal desire to, I mechanically walked across the golden shag rug toward the hallway. In my pink nightgown, I felt so small while my shadow loomed above. As if being called into the dark bedroom I shared with my older sister, my bare feet cautiously treaded over the coarse fibers and then stopped directly in front of the doorway. My toes curled and my fingers clenched. A figure caught my eye and my brain wrestled with it-it was no figment of my imagination and no demon that I could compel to leave. My bony knees knocked together beneath the cotton fabric. 

*Who are you? Are you waiting for me?* 

About my size, maybe four feet in height, it appeared as though a small person stood inside my room, even though bars on the window prevented entry. I peered harder. Moonlight from half-open blinds streaked across its body, so I mistook its skinny form for a skeleton. I had no information in my brain to explain what a grayish-white thing with large black eyes could be, except for the universal term of monster. I knew nothing of aliens and had no reference in my conscious brain in which to compute them. 

We contemplated each other. I only found confusion. My mind kept trying to see through the illusion, to unearth the trick, but I could not. It was real! I backed away terrified. Who would believe me and keep me safe from it? Trying to hold myself together, I apprehensively went to the small apartment kitchen, where Mom dried dishes with her worn hands. Hunched over the sink, she did her chores with precision, never drudgery. She felt happy when household tasks were finished, her mission completed. As a homemaker, her life revolved around my sister and me, and sometimes ... it troubled me. I did not feel I deserved to use up all her healthy years for my rearing and then have nothing to show for it when I left. 

""Is your show over with?"" Her voice was gentle and interested. 

She always cared about what I did, even the mundane. A perfect mother-she broke my heart. I wish she had a normal existence before this one destroyed her. At least she was shielded from the truth behind the scenario, and so was I-for now. 

""No, it's not over yet,"" I said, forcing a laugh, while glancing over my shoulder. ""I just came from my room, but there is a monster in it. I swear I saw something. Isn't that weird?"" 

Her rough hands stopped. The rag halted over the dish as she considered what I said. I held my breath, hoping she would believe me. 

""Don't be silly. There are no monsters."" 

*Then why am I shaking?* 

Just as I thought, there would be no help with my problem. Dad, an accountant, only dealt with the concrete with black and white-not the gray. He would not want to deal with my nonsense. Anna probably knew it was true, but she chose not to remember. Maybe they didn’t want her to, so why can I? I didn’t want to awaken her to the nightmare. 

Distraught, I passed back by my open bedroom door and peered at the creature still standing in front of my window, waiting for me. Black eyes beseeched me. I wanted to cry. My insides tensed as I fought back the tears. Bits of old prayers that I learned as a kid entered my mind. I quickly learned that they were a waste of time. No one would hear them.

*Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.* 

We both knew it was there. That is when I used my powerful human gift-denial. I went back to the couch as if I had lost my soul, sat by Anna, and escaped into TV. What else could I do?

At bedtime, I nervously crept toward my room and turned on the light to scare off the boogeyman. Anna got to stay up later. This was not fair. I was on my own, so I searched around the twin beds, the matching dressers, and the desk. I scanned my shelves of horses and books. Behind the innocence of our room, darkness waited. I know I saw something. Goosebumps plagued my skin. 

*Hello. Are you there?* 

Sighing with relief that nothing was there, I shut off the light, crawled into bed, and lay on my back to keep an eye on things. I hugged my favorite plush bear named Cuddly. I was about to flush the earlier event away, when my eyes met something to the left of my bed. Gray and expressionless, it remained still and silent; but do not think that was any comfort. Though immobile and not threatening me, it had encroached on my reality, shifting it off balance. It did not do anything to startle to me, it stayed where it was at-as if just stopping by for a visit. 

I pulled my Cinderella covers to my chin and clutched Cuddly to my throat. Fearing for my safety, I knew that nothing could protect me. I closed my eyes and opened them several times, but the being remained as it was, watching me. Dark eyes penetrating my brain, it already knew me better than I did. 

On nights that this thing came to see me, it started talking to me. I did not know what telepathy was back then in the seventies. I had been sheltered and never even exposed to science fiction. All I knew was that it showed me mental pictures and spoke with a firm male voice-which struck me as odd-as it did not appear to be either sex. 

He, as I assumed it to be, showed me time-lines of the world's history, beginning with the dinosaurs and explained that catastrophe had destroyed them. For some reason, I started crying. I found the demise upsetting, and the voice told me not to be sad. I couldn't focus on the endless human wars and evil deeds. I wept for the dinosaurs ... for their pain. I was a little girl, not a monster like them. 

""It was horrible for a whole species to be destroyed."" I spoke out-loud, forgetting that I did not need to. It ""spoke"" back. 

""Nothing is ever gone. Anything that has existed can exist again in some place and some time. You just have to want it."" So profound, that was the only thing I ever remember it saying to me back then. That comforted me, even though I didn't really ever want the dinosaurs to come back. I liked the idea that they could. My heart came alive that day with hope. Unfortunately, it needed more to sustain it, more than what these creatures could give me.

I understand what I did had hurt and humiliated him. Words cannot describe how sorry I am for what I did.

Anyways, now that that’s all of the way, I started talking to my ex again and I remembered why I cheated on him. I feel like he makes everything about himself, it felt like the whole world revolved around him, and I was just pushed the side. I just wanted someone to focus on me for once. I just wanted to be the center of attention for once. For context, I made a hinge account behind his back and then he found out the very next day bc one of his friends had seen my account and told him. I know feeling forgotten doesn’t really justify what I did, but I just kind of felt like everything was about him. I got the vibe that his friends didn’t really like me bc every time I would hang out with him and his friends they’d ignore me even when I tried to make conversation, same with his family. I don’t really know what I did prior to the cheating to warrant this behavior but if they didn’t hate me then they sure as hell hate me now. I remember we got coffee the other day and I just remember all he could talk about was himself. He wouldn’t shut up. I could barely get any words in. All I could say was “wow that’s crazy” and “yeah for sure” you know, things like that. He never really asked about me or how I was doing. Every time he texts the most he’ll ask is “How are you?” or “How did you sleep?” and then he’ll go on to talk about himself. I talked to my mom about this and she said she remembered that my high school graduation dinner she said she noticed he seemed a little upset that the attention wasn’t on him and that everyone was focusing on me and I think I noticed that too.

Another thing I realized that’s partially unrelated, but he blocked me back in late August, about a month after I cheated (which is understandable, I would block me too) and then he unblocked me a couple days ago. Why did he unblock me you may ask? Bc I texted one of his friends in November on Snapchat asking about him, the conversation was short as I didn’t want to bother him too much and we never spoke again after that. He then hung out with that same friend a couple days ago. That friend told him that it seems like I missed him and my ex said he would text me. Idk he just feels like he didn’t text me genuinely bc he missed me but because someone told him that I missed him. It was true, I did miss him. I feel bad for what I did. Idk how to feel about all of this. On one hand, it hurts because I feel like it’s been like this my whole life, I feel like I’ve always been ignored by everybody, friends and family alike. But on the other hand, I can’t really say shit to him because I cheated. Cheating automatically discredits me entirely. Again, I’m not trying to justify what I did but I don’t really know who to talk to about this, I just need a place to vent.",1,1768146540.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

In the last week or so mine has started rebooting randomly. Today it even did it mid-making a coffee. 

I know these latest machines basically run an android app, and it looks like the android app is just force stopping due to a crash

It reboots and plays the little boot up chimes. When it did it mid-coffee today the steamer and coffee kept on running during the reboot, then selecting the coffee again after the reboot made it realise the steamer was still going and finish the cycle ok. 

Just a bit annoying!

Then I trier a bit bigge object with mediocore results and by that setted up by me on bambu studio. I checked 7-8 youtube video about the recommended settings. The print was very slow and not even that satysfying.

Now I stepped further tried to put all I learned calibration, ironing, extra walls, out first print, slowing down the head etc etc into this print and took 12 hours to finish but now after 6 hour I can see the hotbed released it partially it warping and even the nozzle hitting a bit.

I've paused the printing tried to raise the hot bed temp to 70° maybe it re stick. But since I'm inexperienced I rather asking you guys and learning from the pros. What can I do? I think its trash and should restart.

In that case can I get settings? To finally have a really good looking print. Azurefilm Orginal PLA I'm using. Printer all factory. Humidity 13%, plate I was cleaning with dry cloth but seems before longer print its better idea to wash and even alcohol clean it.

I enjoy our relationship the way it is even though we aren’t fully poly yet we are still new and exploring and mostly doing superficial or friends with benefits type relationships.

My partner (M33) and I (F32) have been togrther for a year and half. His ex (F35) of five years is also is best friends. 

They are very close. They video call once a week and they text most days. We do long distance so he will often go to her country to visit her when he has to do work in that country. He will spend up to two weeks staying at her house with her current boyfriend as they all get along. 

My problem is that I have asked for boundaries to be set between him and her it has come with a lot of resistance. He continues to claim that he can manage the relationship and that it just takes time for his ex-girlfriend to grow and become comfortable with me.

She has overset boundaries before where I have asked them to stop video calling and she had a whole breakdown and begged to have one just for her birthday. She frequently calls him in a panic over her relationship issues. When he was visiting her, she got really upset with him that he chose to video call with me over meeting up with her for coffee and said that it’s more important to see her than to talk with me because he can talk with me anytime, but he can’t see her all the time. I have a feeling she is jealous that he’s in a relationship.

Recently him and her were video calling, and she randomly asked if I liked her and he answered honestly that I don’t because she adds a lot of unnecessary drama to our relationship and then she flew off the handle and talked about how she doesn’t like me and that I am manipulative and using him for his money . The reason she called me manipulative is because she said I am trying to control him and his relationships with other people by putting boundaries up.

My partner got very upset with her, and they have had a conversation since then where she did some sort of apology where she basically said that she will always be apologizing for her actions because she’s a difficult person and she will apologize for her difficulties for her whole life. Again, I don’t think it was a very proper apology .

We have rules and I know that people can catch feelings and that’s not Something I’m worried about, but I am worried about being hurt by him because I see the way he is handling his female friendship with his ex-girlfriend and I feel like if he ends up seeing someone more than once or regularly while we are apart that I will end up getting hurt by his actions and the breaking of our boundaries that we have.

I just feel kind of confused because I want to trust him that he’ll respect our boundaries but I feel like I haven’t seen that even in a platonic friendship so how can I believe him in a relationship that will involve sex?

I’m really sorry if this is the wrong group to post this in. I just want some advice on how to handle this weird situation through the ENM lens. ",2,1768146405.0,EthicalNonMonogamy,5,1.0,False

Never before however have I even considered going longer. This year I’m strongly considering going longer. Potentially even 6+ months. Even if I don’t continue this past January I am feeling pretty confident that I will dramatically reduce how much I drink. For reference, I would have about 12-16 drinks per week on average probably and mostly socially and on weekends.

“Epiphany” might be a little dramatic especially for such a seemingly obvious observation. I feel like I’m having an epiphany however because I am realizing through the actual experience, just how much time and energy I’ve lost through these habits. It’s one thing to acknowledge this when you’re still consuming but now I’m really starting to internalize this.

I love my friends, and I don’t want to lose them but my relationship with many of the ones I hang out with most is very much bonded soley by drinking. I’ll go out on weekends drinking with them, I’ll have a good time but that will be my entire Friday and Saturday night. I’ll wake up the next morning at like 10:30am, slowly make a breakfast, drink coffee and by the time I’m really ready to start my day it’s noon time and I might be slightly hung over, had bad quality sleep and I don’t have motivation to get anything productive or creatively interesting done such as graphic design work or make music which are two things I’m passionate about but have lost some interest in over the years.

In just 10 days now, no drinking has made a huge difference! It’s also made it much easier to stick to new positive habits that I’m implementing and I’m really excited to see where this takes me.

Don’t get me wrong, I AM more bored on the weekends, I’m LOSING some social interaction,  and I DO miss my hazy IPAs. But the ROI on this is worth it all. At least for the time-being.
With all that said, I do see myself drinking again at some point like I said but I think my relationship with alcohol with be healthier when I come back to it. 1 night during the week 2-3 drinks that night sounds good to me. It’s funny how I’ve been doing this every January for years now but this year, it’s hitting me differently.

Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

I used to think this way. Then I encountered Todd Friel saying ""If you are debating someone and they can no longer tell that you love them, you've lost the debate. It doesn't matter how right you are, Christians are known by their love."" We don't want to just be noisy. The world (at least in America) knows what we believe about most things. Honestly it rarely needs to be stated to be known by the person.

1 Corinthians 13:1 ESV
[1] If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 

I'm familiar with the counterargument, I used to use it constantly ""It's not love to condone someone's sin."" And that's true. But what I'm suggesting is a way that neither affirms nor condones it, but rather makes an open door for the person. To be clear at this point, I am talking about talking to those outside the church. To those inside the church we are called to call to repentance. We don't need people to act better to receive the Gospel. People need to receive the Holy Spirit to accept it. 

1 Corinthians 2:14 ESV
[14] The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned. 

Rosario Butterfield was a gay woman who was invited by a local pastor after she wrote an article condemning Christianity. She and her wife had a meal with the pastor and his wife and they didn't ever try to make her change. But she got another invite for dinner, and another and another. She kept coming because she enjoyed his company. She credits this as the reason she became a Christian (and a fairly famous one at that). She wasn't told she needed to change, she was simply invited into a space where she could.

It has been said there is no hate like Christian love. That is not the love we are to be known by. I'm not calling anyone to deny Gospel truths. But I ask you to consider that people need a space to change. A lot of our evangelism tries to work the same as the street preaching most of us hate. Having coffee with your coworker once and sharing the bridge or another gospel illustration rarely works, but an invitation to share your life opens the door to an entire testimony. What Jesus did was open the door to people who had been shut out of the Temple. He invited them in and spent time with them. He did preach, but let's not focus on just that one aspect. It takes time, but it's an approach that pushes fewer people away with a bad taste in their mouths.",8,1768145456.0,TrueChristian,4,0.83,False

I’ve never posted in this group before, but I’ve seen others ask about marriage and found the responses thoughtful and helpful.

I’m not looking for anyone to criticize my spouse or myself. I’m really hoping for a fresh, outside perspective that isn’t shaped by my own emotions and blind spots. I genuinely want to know how to move forward. I do not want a divorce, I want to salvage this marriage and build a beautiful future together.

I’ll try to lay things out as clearly and neutrally as possible.

**Quick background**

* Started dating: 2022
* Started living together later in 2022 (I owned the house with my sister at the time)
* Married: 2025
* Moved into our first home together: spring of this year
* Ages: 29F / 27M

Since moving into our own home (without my sister), certain differences have become much more noticeable and I feel like we're arguing a lot more. We are currently going to couple's therapy but it only does so much.

**Main concerns**

**1. Feeling like roommates instead of partners**

I often feel like I’m going through life on my own schedule while he’s on his, more like roommates than a team.

We don’t share many interests or hobbies (other than the gym, more on this later). We’ve talked about this in therapy, but it feels like we’ve hit a wall. I don’t expect us to share everything, and I’m happy he has his own interests and friends, but we also don’t really come together in everyday life. For example...

**Typical weekday:** I wake up around 7am, hydrate, walk the dogs, make his breakfast and coffee, and prep his lunch (I do all the cooking). He has me wake him up about 10 minutes before leaving for work (around 8:50am), we exchange a quick kiss, and then he’s gone.

We run a business together with my sister, which is great, but it sometimes feels like the only thing we can talk about meaningfully.

He’s usually at work until 6–7pm. Four days a week (Mon, Tues, Thurs, Fri) he goes to the gym with friends after work. He’ll stop home briefly to drop off his dog, then gets home around 7–8pm. During the day there's brief text interactions, 99% of the time about work. I usually have dinner ready. We’ll watch a show while eating and maybe a couple more episodes after. Most nights he then goes to his computer to play video games or listen to fantasy audiobooks, his main downtime activities. Or I'll watch a show, and he'll lay there listening to his audiobook.

Wednesdays are supposed to be “our night,” but it usually ends up being the same routine: dinner and a show.

Fridays, after the gym, he has a weekly game with friends that he’s very invested in, so he comes home after I’m already asleep.

He typically stays up very late, midnight to 2–3am, while I go to bed much earlier, since I wake up earlier to get the house all together and just don't think it's reasonable for our lives to have that bedtime/wake schedule.

**Weekends:** More relaxed, but the same pattern. I wake earlier, he sleeps in. He spends a lot of time napping, gaming, listening to audiobooks, or occasionally working on the weekend (going into work). We’ll sometimes visit family together. Rarely the dog park or a walk (usually only if I ask, I’ve mostly stopped asking as he's made it clear he does not like going on walks). Nights are usually more TV.

We don’t live in an area with much to do without driving. We’ve tried board games, which are fine, but that’s about it.

I’m glad he goes to the gym and has friends. But overall, this leaves me feeling like we’re living parallel lives. I’m not lonely, I work from home and am comfortable alone, but I don’t feel like I’m in a partnership.

**2. Nearly nonexistent sex life**

Our sex life is extremely sparse. The last time we had sex, I drove an hour to buy lingerie, planned a whole evening (even had a shot of tequila because he ""wishes we could have wine every once in a while together"" (even though I'm proudly sober by choice and he knows this)), even did a lap dance. It was nice, but it was one and done. Nothing since. Before that, things were already stale.

I don’t blame him entirely. I work from home and don’t get dressed up daily. I don’t wear makeup most days. But I do take very good care of myself, stay in shape, and prioritize my health. Still, the lack of desire and physical touch has really affected my confidence. I feel unattractive and unwanted.

I’m actively working on balancing my hormones because I want to be a mom, but his libido also seems very low, between work, gym, napping, screen time and late nights. When we do have sex, there’s little passion it seems like. I don’t even know if this bothers him and I feel uncomfortable bringing it up more.

**3. Difficulty talking about deeper things**

Most of our conversations revolve around work. I’m very health-oriented, love cooking, baking, watching the sunrise/sunset and caring for our home. He’s deeply into fantasy, games, and his online world.

We both lift and value fitness, but we don’t do it together. He goes after work with friends. I go during the day and sometimes on weekends. I’ve invited him to join me on weekends, usually it’s a no, or he’ll just use the sauna. We don’t actually work out together.

He also shuts down around future-oriented conversations. We both want kids, but I’m older and feel urgency; he isn’t concerned about timing at all. I’ve stopped bringing it up because it caused tension, but it makes me sad.

Even light future questions (like ""what holiday traditions would be fun to adopt in the future?"") have been shut down as “that will just cause unnecessary stress,” and dismissed the question all together, which really hurt and led to arguments because (paraphrasing) ""I get so upset so easily and turn something small into an argument just like that"" (but why is it okay that he responds that way, how is that fun for me?) This has been brought up in therapy so there's at least eyes on it.

**4. Frequent arguments and emotional disconnect**

I’m very sensitive and emotionally expressive. He struggles with emotions and doesn’t see himself as raising his voice or reacting harshly, even when it feels that way to me. Raised voices make me shut down completely.

Because I care so much about health, I used to encourage healthier habits for him, which led to resentment. I’ve stopped entirely bringing this up as I respect his choices, and now lead by example, but the damage seems done. Now, almost any concern I bring up (even unrelated to health) gets a defensive or shut-down response. This has also been brought up in therapy but it's still something to mention.

He has very little patience for me.

**How I feel**

I wish I had someone to:

* Go on walks with (where we both want to go, not me feeling like I'm forcing him)
* Be active together (same as above)
* Talk about the future with (same as above)
* Share routines with (mornings, evenings, life rhythms) (same as above, all would be forced now since I don't think it's something he genuinely wants)

I respect his schedule and know I *can* do these things alone, but my heart feels heavy.

We’re in virtual couples therapy. He’s acknowledged his defensiveness, but it feels like there’s more underneath that isn’t being addressed. I’ve tried meeting him where he is, even started listening to his fantasy audiobooks so we’d have something in common (it’s been hard, but I’m trying slowly). I’ve also started going to church on Sundays for myself; he’s very cynical about church due to his upbringing, so I go alone as he's made it clear it's not something he wants to do and ""will go, but doesn't really want to"".

We have a tropical trip booked in March with his parents. We have a blessed life in many ways: good dogs, family, financial stability, a safe home. And yet I don’t know where to go from here. I feel myself slipping into a place of emotional detachment while still being deeply hurt and wanting this to work.

With all this said, he's overall a great guy, this past weekend he intentionally helped me with my baking, spent time just laying in the living room instead of upstairs alone, and visited my family briefly with me. He even went on a walk. This is all because a few nights ago while going to bed I told him I feel really sad about this all (Again) and feel like I get the short end of the stick of his time. So he's likely putting in effort as a result, which I appreciate, but that's actually what prompted me to write this - now I feel like he's only doing that because I brought that up again, not because he genuinely wants to really work on and prioritize our marriage and life together.

**My question**

Is there any advice or perspective that could help me figure out my next steps?  
What would *you* do in this situation if your goal was to salvage the marriage? Can anyone relate or could relate in the past?

We have a DF54 grinder and even with the finest possible setting, a whopping 22g in the basket (Normcore bottomless), spring-loaded tamper and pre-infusion, I get an output of around 60g/30s and don't see any more options to get this lower. It's the finest grind possible, it's well-tampered. No channeling, basket filled up. The output obviously way too much. It also doesn't make a difference if the beans are freshly roasted or have been in a proper sealed coffee bucket for 2-3 or more weeks.

When we recently bought different beans from a specialty coffee shop, it clogged the portafilter despite a more coarse grind and less coffee in the basket. Hell, it even clogged the grinder. Beans clearly make a difference. A big one.

Now it's not news that beans matter and can vary greatly in quality. The clogging beans had seemingly much more humidity in them.

My question is: How do I tell the quality of beans before buying? Is this even possible or rather limited and I can only go by trial and error, testing different beans?

We buy our regular beans at a local store that has sold coffee since 1913, has a wide range of beans of different origins and types, roasts them in the store and offers good support. They're also not super cheap (they're up to 45€/kg). I'd have assumed their beans are fine. And they do look and smell good. But it seems they're just not suited for a decent espresso.

He spends a lot of time napping, gaming, listening to audiobooks, or occasionally working on the weekend (going into work). We’ll sometimes visit family together. Rarely the dog park or a walk (usually only if I ask, I’ve mostly stopped asking as he's made it clear he does not like going on walks). Nights are usually more TV.

We don’t live in an area with much to do without driving. We’ve tried board games, which are fine, but that’s about it.

I’m glad he goes to the gym and has friends. But overall, this leaves me feeling like we’re living parallel lives. I’m not lonely, I work from home and am comfortable alone, but I don’t feel like I’m in a partnership.

**2. Nearly nonexistent sex life**

Our sex life is extremely sparse. The last time we had sex, I drove an hour to buy lingerie, planned a whole evening (even had a shot of tequila because he ""wishes we could have wine every once in a while together"" (even though I'm proudly sober by choice and he knows this)), even did a lap dance. It was nice, but it was one and done. Nothing since. Before that, things were already stale.

I don’t blame him entirely. I work from home and don’t get dressed up daily. I don’t wear makeup most days. But I do take very good care of myself, stay in shape, and prioritize my health. Still, the lack of desire and physical touch has really affected my confidence. I feel unattractive and unwanted.

I’m actively working on balancing my hormones because I want to be a mom, but his libido also seems very low, between work, gym, napping, screen time and late nights. When we do have sex, there’s little passion it seems like. I don’t even know if this bothers him and I feel uncomfortable bringing it up more. 

**3. Difficulty talking about deeper things**

Most of our conversations revolve around work. I’m very health-oriented, love cooking, baking, watching the sunrise/sunset and caring for our home. He’s deeply into fantasy, games, and his online world.

We both lift and value fitness, but we don’t do it together. He goes after work with friends. I go during the day and sometimes on weekends. I’ve invited him to join me on weekends, usually it’s a no, or he’ll just use the sauna. We don’t actually work out together.

He also shuts down around future-oriented conversations. We both want kids, but I’m older and feel urgency; he isn’t concerned about timing at all. I’ve stopped bringing it up because it caused tension, but it makes me sad.

Even light future questions (like ""what holiday traditions would be fun to adopt in the future?"") have been shut down as “that will just cause unnecessary stress,” and dismissed the question all together, which really hurt and led to arguments because (paraphrasing) ""I get so upset so easily and turn something small into an argument just like that"" (but why is it okay that he responds that way, how is that fun for me?) This has been brought up in therapy so there's at least eyes on it.

**4. Frequent arguments and emotional disconnect**

I’m very sensitive and emotionally expressive. He struggles with emotions and doesn’t see himself as raising his voice or reacting harshly, even when it feels that way to me. Raised voices make me shut down completely.

Because I care so much about health, I used to encourage healthier habits for him, which led to resentment. I’ve stopped entirely bringing this up as I respect his choices, and now lead by example, but the damage seems done. Now, almost any concern I bring up (even unrelated to health) gets a defensive or shut-down response. This has also been brought up in therapy but it's still something to mention. 

He has very little patience for me. 

**How I feel**

I wish I had someone to:

* Go on walks with (where we both want to go, not me feeling like I'm forcing him)
* Be active together (same as above)
* Talk about the future with (same as above)
* Share routines with (mornings, evenings, life rhythms) (same as above, all would be forced now since I don't think it's something he genuinely wants)

I respect his schedule and know I *can* do these things alone, but my heart feels heavy.

We’re in virtual couples therapy. He’s acknowledged his defensiveness, but it feels like there’s more underneath that isn’t being addressed. I’ve tried meeting him where he is, even started listening to his fantasy audiobooks so we’d have something in common (it’s been hard, but I’m trying slowly). I’ve also started going to church on Sundays for myself; he’s very cynical about church due to his upbringing, so I go alone as he's made it clear it's not something he wants to do and ""will go, but doesn't really want to"".

We have a tropical trip booked in March with his parents. We have a blessed life in many ways: good dogs, family, financial stability, a safe home. And yet I don’t know where to go from here. I feel myself slipping into a place of emotional detachment while still being deeply hurt and wanting this to work.

With all this said, he's overall a great guy, this past weekend he intentionally helped me with my baking, spent time just laying in the living room instead of upstairs alone, and visited my family briefly with me. He even went on a walk. This is all because a few nights ago while going to bed I told him I feel really sad about this all (Again) and feel like I get the short end of the stick of his time. So he's likely putting in effort as a result, which I appreciate, but that's actually what prompted me to write this - now I feel like he's only doing that because I brought that up again, not because he genuinely wants to really work on and prioritize our marriage and life together. 

Adding based on a comment: I should’ve added that we get along well, we can laugh together, we used to be goofy and silly together more. We both think the other is generally funny! He will just flip me upside down and over etc when things are good and we’re energetic. But there just hasn’t been as much of a zest or love lately due to how things have played out. He still smooches me goodnight, he does deeply care, I know he is ALWAYS there for me if I need him. 

**My question**

Is there any advice or perspective that could help me figure out my next steps?  
What would *you* do in this situation if your goal was to salvage the marriage? Can anyone relate or could relate in the past?

I’ve had two long-term relationships, both started from friendships. So I’ve never actually been on a real first date with someone I barely know. I’m now using Hinge, I get decent matches every week, but I never have the courage to ask someone out.

Not because I’m scared they’ll say no, I’m scared they’ll say yes. And then I’ll have to go.

The idea of a first date makes me freeze. I don’t drink coffee, I cant drink alcohol (since I need drive everywhere), and I’m living in a new country where I don’t know the good spots. I’m scared of not knowing how to greet them, of the first few minutes being awkward, of not knowing what to say. Of just, being weird situation.

What makes it worse is, I can talk and apparently I’m fairly good looking. My job is literally working with people. Most of my friends and colleagues would say I’m confident (even though I’m a big introvert). But for some reason, dating just unlocks this fear in me. Like, deep fear.

I usually make my own masala chai with whole spices and black tea from a bag of Brooke Bond Taaza gifted by a friend from Bangladesh. This Tazo tea bag was a freebie when I bought some decaffeinated tea from one of our members in this group. With this cold I have, I wanted a strong-tasting tea. 

Instructions were to steep for 5 minutes in 250 ml of boiling water. The result was indeed a strong-tasting tea, but not the way I know masala chai to be. It’s usually made with a lot of milk. I personally boil the tea directly in milk. The remedy was 2 teaspoons of Coffee-Mate and a sachet of Splenda.

28 November 2008

I just got adopted by his family. We went to Thanksgiving at his parents’ house and I feel like  I belong. His mom opened the door and hugged me like she’d been waiting years - thirty seconds full squeeze. I almost cried right there.

I brought the coconut cake I baked at 0300 because I couldn’t sleep and wanted the damn thing to be perfect. I swear I kept checking the recipe like it was a mission brief. I gave his Dad a bottle of Crown Royal. He took one look at the bottle and told Eric, “Son, you finally did something right.” I smirked so hard my face hurt.

The house was chaos in the best way—fireplace roaring, football on mute, relatives arguing over carving rights. His niece who is super shy, saw my dog tags peeking out and asked if I was a superhero. I let her hold them. Should have seen her eyes, journal. I think I won her over. 

Late lunch. I had my thigh pressed against his under the table just to feel him and calm my nerves. There is just something about touching him that makes me feel so…comfortable.

The funniest thing happened while we were eating - his Dad asked if I could shoot and when I  told him a lot better than his son, the table erupted. There was no uncomfortable times - they talked as if I’ve always been part of their family. His precious little niece climbed up in my lap. Damn his family has great genetics. I fit. 

After dessert, his Mom pulled me into the kitchen for “coffee help.” Took both my hands, looked me in the eye and  welcomed me into the family. I almost lost it. My family was never this close, journal. 

Later on the back porch with the fog rolling in and the fire crackling inside, I hugged him from behind and told him that I think they like me. I really feel it, journal. They like me. He told me the claimed me. 

As we were leaving everyone hugged me and welcomed me to the family. His Mom said there will always be a place for me. I feel at home. ",2,1768144454.0,lostlove,1,1.0,False

I just finished reading a novel set in Japan that really vibed as something that would fit the AP very well, because it involves a ghost and a limited form of time travel.

Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi 

Spoiler - plot of the book
>!The story revolves around a very distinct time-travel idea. If you sit in a specific seat in the cafe you can travel into the past (or possibly future) to meet someone who was in the cafe at that point in time. There are very specific rules:
You can't change events
You can't leave the seat
You can only travel once
Your visit lasts until your drink goes cold - if you overstay it is fatal
The seat is only available when the current occupant stands up. That person is actually a ghost, the last person who didn't finish their coffee in time.
The ghost will curse anyone attempting to move it to gain access to the seat - they are very powerful.
Only one of the cafe staff can perform the rituals necessary to release the curse or initiate time travel!<

Where it would fit
>!I think it would work really well if this scenario was added to the Leshy's Saloon. If characters can figure out a way to speak to someone in a different time it could help them uncover clues in a very thematic way if the PCs get stuck. Perhaps a previous cycle of an NPC they're close to has strangely inconsistent memories and insists the PC's best friend is someone they've never met, giving the impression of a ripple in a pond that changes every time you drop a pebble. Perhaps they can speak to someone with memories of the night of broken blades...
Anyone with Willowshore Lore or a connection to the saloon would know the story of the magical seat, and that the rules are specific and dangerous so most people will never try!<",2,1768144403.0,SeasonofGhosts,0,1.0,False

I’ve never posted before, and I’m not sure if there’s anything I can do in the situation, but I’d appreciate any advice. 

Yesterday, I picked up my daughter’s friend (both 8) and we had a fun little day planned. We just had a Paris Baguette open in our city, and I was super excited because I’ve been wanting to try them forever. We get to the area and it’s a little strip with a few restaurants that’s being built up, construction, parking lot is tiny, traffic is terrible- it’s a Saturday at 1:30 like duh. We end up driving around the parking lot for probably 10 minutes looking for a spot, and, just as I was about to leave, we found one. We go in, get our stuff, and I ask the girls if they want to eat inside or the car. They say the car so we can leave earlier. If you’ve ever eaten with an 8 year told, they take a millennia to eat their food. We were going to a craft store to get stuff to make bookmarks after then supposed to go to a meetup at the park at 2 and were running behind, so to the car we went. I live in DFW area. I like to be 100% focused on driving when I’m driving. I’m also hungry and super excited to eat this coffee croissant donut that I’ve been dreaming about. We get to the car, I give the girls their food, I’m eating mine and chatting with them. I start hearing honking after about a minute or less. I dismiss it as just the crazy parking lot. Then, I’m turned back talking to my daughter and notice that there’s a big white dodge ram behind me with a tiny man waving and yelling at me asking me to leave holding up ALL the traffic. I shake my head and wave him away. He then gets out of his truck and heads towards my drivers side door. I lock the doors and he’s yelling for me to leave. I yell back that I’m not leaving yet. He heads back towards his truck but starts bitching to the cars he’s blocking that I’m just sitting there not leaving, etc. I’m completely blocked even if I wanted to leave. He finally moves on, I finish my donut and make sure the girls are buckled, and we leave. As I’m exiting the parking lot area, we come across the same guy coming from the opposite direction. He speeds up into my lane as if he’s going to hit my head on then slams on his break as he’s about to reach my bumper. Girls are crying and terrified. I’m getting really worried. 99/100 small men in big trucks in Texas carry firearms, and almost every day we have road rage deaths. He’s completely blocking traffic, tons of witnesses, and stays there for what felt like forever. Finally leaves, and as he gets to my rear drivers side door, he opens his door and slams it into my car. I memorize his license plate number and end up verifying with a witness at a light that it was correct, and get away from Sergeant Deranged. I call non emergency police, they tell me to come to the station and make a report. My car has some significant denting and damage. 
Here’s my question:
I want to hold this man accountable, but not at the expense of my family’s safety. 
Is there any way to file with insurance without giving this man my name or information? 


TLDR: Deranged tiny man damages my car over me not leaving my parking spot quick enough; can I file insurance without him finding any information about me?

1qa1nzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1qa1nzn/jealousy_over_highschool_anime_romance_because_i/,Jealousy over highschool anime romance because I missed out on young love.,"
I'm 23, still single. I'm a guy, bisexual but ain't interested in girls romantically, just with guys ,Introverted, I'm not perfect but I'm not exactly bad looking either, not trying to brag but I do get compliments so there's that but I'm just an ordinary nice person in general.
My point is there's nothing wrong with me. Again I'm not perfect but I'm also not that terrible, just in case you're wondering how come I'm still single. It just didn't happen I guess.

Anyways....

I know this sounds so stupid but, an extreme jealousy washes over me whenever I see highschool romantic anime because it feels like I couldn't related. I wanted to laugh or giggle at the scene along with the audience who probably have the same reaction, but deep down it makes me feel so uncomfortable watching it. I know it's fictional but at the same time, it feels weird seeing two 16, or 17 years old couples kissing, holding hands, even sleeping together (like from Kaguya Sama and Horimiya; which triggers my jealousy the most). It's not just jealousy, it's also about feeling lonely. At first, I thought it's just about highschool animes, but whenever I see highschool students irl, actually kissing, holding hands, I get the same feeling. I hate how much I feel this way. I know it's very wrong and I probably need to talk to someone about this but it's sooooo embarrassing, so I always ends up dealing it with myself. It's actually killing me (yes, that's how serious it is to the point that it bothers my everyday life). 

Look, I'm happy with the rest of the things I have today. I still think I'm lucky. But I can't help but to feel that I missed out a lot of things because I didn't get to experience young love. When I was in highschool, I didn't really care much. But when I turned 21, I think that's when it suddenly hit me that I missed out young love. I have confessed to my crushes before, asked them out, and they all rejected me, in a nice way at least, but that still stung. During college, I only had one crush, but that person already got a boyfriend.

Sometimes I even think about kissing or doing stuff with someone at my age isn't as intense as doing it when you're a teenager. I still can't believe my classmates before have experienced kissing and doing ""it"" at that age. It must've been amazing and eye opening. Doing it now is not the same compare when you're younger.

Yes, I've tried dating as well before I graduated college last year (from dating app because my classmate convinced me because I'm still single) but none of them leads to anything. The last person I dated (they're all casual coffee date btw) we got into talking stage but after a month, he stood me up, he just realized I'm just not his type. So that's over.

Now the thing that bothers me the most is that, maybe I couldn't wait any longer, I ended up doing ""it"" to someone, casually. Hookup, one night stand, fling, tet tat tet, whatever you call it. It feels so.... ironic to lose my first kiss and everything after saving myself to someone special for so long (I was 22 when it happened, last year). I know that sounds so..naive maybe but that's how I wanted it, to be special. So it's not just that I missed out young love, it's also that I lost my first time to someone I don't actually like and I don't genuinely care about. I feel so messed up already. If you're getting frustrated how pitiful of pathetic I sound rn, it's understandable. I'm not posting this to confirm how pitiful I am. Because I still don't think I'm pathetic because I know life is more than this thing. Maybe I just want to rant this to someone who doesn't know me personally.

1qa1ays,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qa1ays/the_cigarette_case/,The Cigarette Case,"🇵🇱Gdańsk, Poland. The 90s.

Kazimierz found the cigarette case one morning on a bench as he walked his usual route through the park to the shipyard, where he worked as a painter. In the gloom, the ugly outlines of creaking cranes loomed, resembling sick birds, and the smell of dampness and rotting autumn leaves seemed to crawl directly into his soul, causing fits of melancholy.

Kazimierz looked around and, seeing no one nearby, picked up the case from the rain-soaked bench. It was silver, looked simple — without inscriptions or engravings. On the move, Kazimierz opened it and saw that it was full.

— O kurwa! — Kazimierz exclaimed with joy. — O kurwa! To dobrze!

He was genuinely happy about the find: his cigarettes had run out yesterday, and Kazimierz desperately wanted a smoke. He took out a filter cigarette with no markings, sniffed it, and, after making sure it was tobacco, lit it and took a greedy drag. His head swam, and with a sigh of relief, he exhaled the smoke, noting that the tobacco was excellent. Pleased, feeling as if on wings, Kazimierz hurried to the gate to make it to his shift on time.

The rusty wind beat against the walls of the smoking area when the crew came out for their afternoon break.

— Got a smoke, Kazimierz? — his partner Tadeusz asked, coughing terribly and spitting up yellow phlegm. — We’ll smoke mine tomorrow.

— Here, — Kazimierz said, opening the case and offering him a cigarette.

— Wow, good tobacco, — Tadeusz said, taking a drag, and again went into a fit of coughing, exhaling smoke.

— Kurwa mać, this painting work will be the end of me, I’ll cough up my lungs, — Tadeusz rasped glumly.

Kazimierz remained silent. He knew about the harm, but he continued to go to this job, as if chained, just like all the other laborers. He saw their thoughts on their faces in the morning and knew what they were thinking when they walked home from work.

The next morning, Kazimierz, as always, woke up earlier than anyone else and left while his son and wife were still asleep. Coffee and a cigarette on an empty stomach were his loyal morning friends. And, opening the case, he saw that it was full again.

— Matko Boska!, that can’t be! — Kazimierz exclaimed and began to carefully examine the case and the cigarettes. Nothing unusual. But he couldn’t believe his eyes and tore up one cigarette: it looked like tobacco, good tobacco, and the smell was right.

— Fine, — he said, snapping the case shut and finding no explanation for what had happened. He lit up, sipping his coffee, looking out the window, and thinking about the miracles that still happen in this world.

So several days passed, and every morning the case was full. Kazimierz, offering the foreman a cigarette in the morning, asked about Tadeusz.

— I called his wife, Agnieszka, last night, — the foreman replied. — She said he died. First, he started throwing up blood, and then he coughed up his lungs into the sink. The ambulance didn’t make it.

— Jezu Chryste… — Kazimierz whispered, his blood running cold, and stepped away. He understood that the case was the cause. The very one from which he had been handing out cigarettes left and right. “Who’s next?” — Kazimierz thought with horror. After smoking down to the filter and burning his fingers, he immediately lit the next one.

— Heard the news, Kazimierz? — the workers asked in the smoking area.

— What news? — he asked, growing cold inside.

— Waldek, our grinder, died. He choked on phlegm in his sleep. How did he manage that?..

Kazimierz shrugged indifferently and, without another word, went back to work.

Over the next few months, a series of accidents and fatal illnesses wiped out almost the entire old crew of their shift. Only Kazimierz and a few other guys who didn’t smoke were left. Just yesterday, after work, when Kazimierz offered a cigarette to a new guy, the man died in a crash, his head hitting the dash as his car swerved into oncoming traffic. The cause of the accident was a cigarette that had fallen onto the seat.

Maybe the cigarette case wasn’t forgotten or lost, but left there on purpose? Maybe someone before couldn’t bear the weight and got rid of it that way?

These thoughts swirled in Kazimierz’s head as he stood early in the morning in that same gloomy park at the familiar bench. He thought: it’s time to leave it, to throw it away for good, enough!

At the same time, he rationalized it to himself: now he was more careful — he only offered cigarettes from the case to random passersby. For his own, he had a regular pack.

— Tomorrow… I’ll throw it away tomorrow, — Kazimierz promised himself and hurried to work, knowing deep down that this “tomorrow” would never come.

That night, his son woke up, needing to use the toilet. Returning, he noticed the edge of the cigarette case sticking out of his father’s jacket pocket. Listening — everyone was asleep — he quietly and carefully pulled out two cigarettes for himself and a friend.

“Well, even if Dad notices, what’s he gonna do? Spank me?” — the boy thought.

Chuckling, pleased with his mischief, he went back to bed.

Will he feel guilt?,"My boyfriend of 4.5 years broke up with me over text and ghosted me for a week, then when we met up to exchange belongings, he seemed so cold and heartless. He conveyed that simply the relationship wasn’t working, I was “too much” and that he wanted someone more warm and kind. When we first started dating when I was 17, I was too dependent and I feel myself thinking back to mistakes I made as a teenager. He moved to another city, and started hanging out in fancy private members clubs while refusing to get a basic job, so he would often have no money for anything. I would have to lend him money for bus tickets, food, coffee and have him get angry when I suggest simple things like getting a taxi at 3am when out, or catching the bus. I became resentful and upset, he would just get angry and defensive, often swearing at me in public. I wanted him to be better, but he seemed happier with other people and would accept free drinks and cigarettes all the time, whilst he has a chronic health condition. He called me controlling for not wanting him to get drunk and smoke, going out til 3am but it could really impact his liver function. I just loved and cared so much, that’s why I got emotional. I became part of his family, his mum wanted to meet me right after the break up and agreed that he had changed for the worse. Now I keep beating myself up about being grumpy, annoyed and upset the past year.

A month on, he still has never apologised for breaking my heart in the most avoidant and disrespectful way. He used to be really sweet. I feel so sad now, and he keeps posting himself wearing suits, partying, drinking wine and hanging out with posh people. Trying to portray to the world that his life is going so well. Do you think he will regret this? What do other men on here think of this behaviour? Just partying after doing something so disrespectful. ",3,1768143062.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

Just that she was working on written consent as stated in her contract. Baldoni’s characterization has never been supported by a shred of evidence.

\- **#17** – requesting the all hands meeting. The one he claims was an ambush and he was invited alone, that was outlined in the protections document.

**December 28th** **2023**: Blake sends a polite professional message to request the All hands meeting stated in the Protections doc. With Baldoni (and Jamey if on set) and the whole team. She gave him the option of alone or that Jamey is welcome. And the team, and someone else redacted if he preferred (legal?).

**December 30th** **2023**: Baldoni rages and stutters to Greenberg that she had the audacity to message him directly, and to invite him alone (she didn’t). That she refused a body double (she didn’t). And complains about dealing with “an actress” (she was a producer and human also) who is re-writing the writer and director. Clearly exerting his position and authority. While demeaning her. Showing no signs of feeling extorted and intimidated by her power. Demanding they get others involved too.

The whole thing is Colleen Hoover’s personal perspective on empowerment through intergenerational trauma. Not about sex. He just does not get it.

Baldoni and Heath never told him the truth. And was acting only on the word of Baldoni and Heath. Without any independent verification or investigation.

# BUSINESS SECRETS OF THE PHAROAHS
**By Mark Crorigan**
*(A British London Publication)*

---

### FOREWORD: THE VIEW FROM THE ZIGGURAT
*(Note: I am aware Ziggurats are Mesopotamian, but the metaphor regarding altitude remains valid).*

The first thing to note when discussing the business secrets of the Pharaohs is an acknowledgement that their era was so completely different from our own that almost all cultural, political, and particularly business parallels we draw between the two eras are, by their very nature, **bound to be wrong**.

However, the modern business landscape is a desert. It is hostile, resource-poor, and populated by tribes of nomads (consultants) who wish to sack your city. To survive, one cannot simply be a ""manager."" One must be a God-King. One must have the stone-faced resolve of Ramesses II and the administrative attention to detail of a Third Dynasty vizier.

I wrote this book not because I am an expert in Egyptology—though I have watched several very good documentaries on the History Channel—but because I am an expert in survival. I have survived mergers. I have survived audits. I have survived sharing a flat with a man who fundamentally does not understand the concept of a ""bill."" This is my gift to you.

---

### CHAPTER 1: THE PYRAMID PRINCIPLE
**Structural Integrity, Verticality, and the Fallacy of the Flat Hierarchy**

Modern HR departments love to talk about the ""flat hierarchy."" They want an ""open culture"" where the intern feels comfortable critiquing the CEO. This is madness. It is the architectural equivalent of a swamp.

The Pharaohs understood that stability comes from **Triangles**.

**The Base: The Broad Back of Labour**
To build high, you need a wide base. In Giza, this was the *Fellahin*—the agricultural labourers. In a modern corporation, these are the temp staff, the data entry clerks, and the people in the call centre who are not allowed to sit down.
* **Management Secret:** You must view the Base not as individuals with hopes and dreams, but as ""blocks."" A block does not need a ""career development plan."" A block needs to be heavy, silent, and capable of bearing a load. If you start asking the blocks about their weekends, you introduce air pockets into the mortar. Air pockets lead to structural failure. Keep the blocks compressed.

**The Internal Ramp: The Hidden Career Path**
For centuries, historians debated how the stones were raised. We now believe they used an *internal ramp*—a spiraling tunnel inside the pyramid, hidden from view.
This is how you must manage your career. To the outside world, you are a loyal stationary object. But inside? You are climbing.
* **The Strategy:** Do the jobs nobody sees. Fix the toner cartridge. Organize the fire safety folder. Be the only person who knows how the server backup works. You are building a ramp of indispensability. When the layoffs come, they cannot fire you, because you are the only one who knows the password to the client database. You have walled yourself in. You are safe.

**The Capstone: The Gold Standard**
The top of the pyramid was capped with *electrum* (a mix of gold and silver) to blindingly reflect the sun. This is the role of Upper Management. Their job is not to ""do"" things. Their job is to blind the shareholders with radiance. Do not resent the Capstone for doing nothing. If the Capstone started moving around and ""helping,"" it would fall off and kill everyone.

---

### CHAPTER 2: MAKE UK COMPANY LAW YOUR ANUBIS
**The Jackal, The Scales, and The Art of Weaponized Compliance**

In the Egyptian pantheon, **Anubis** is the jackal-headed god of the afterlife. He is the guardian of the scales. He oversees the Weighing of the Heart.

In the modern corporate pantheon, Anubis is the **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)** or the **Health and Safety Executive (HSE)**.

Many managers fear regulation. They see guidelines and compliance frameworks as hindrances. This is a peasant mindset. The Pharaoh knows that the Law is not a cage; it is a weapon. It is a cudgel with which to beat your enemies into submission.

**The Hall of Two Truths (The Disciplinary Hearing)**
When a soul died, it faced the 42 Judges of Ma'at and had to recite the ""Negative Confession"" (*""I have not stolen grain,"" ""I have not slain men,"" etc.*).
Modern corporate life has its own Negative Confession:
* *""I have not utilized the company credit card for personal fuel consumption.""*
* *""I have not engaged in sexual relations in the server room.""*
* *""I have not defamed the company on Twitter.""*

You must memorize these confessions. When a rival—let’s call him ""Jeff""—attempts to undermine your authority, do not argue with him. Report him to Anubis. Did Jeff fail to complete his mandatory diversity training? That is a sin against Ma'at. Report it. Watch as Ammit the Devourer (Human Resources) consumes his soul.

**The Canopic Jars of Departmentalization**
Anubis presided over mummification, where organs were separated into jars. You must do the same. Never allow your personal life (The Heart) to mix with your professional life (The Brain).
* **The Liver (Imsety):** This represents your alcohol consumption. Keep this strictly for networking events.
* **The Stomach (Duamutef):** This represents your hunger for promotion. Keep it sealed. If people see your hunger, they will starve you. If you look full, they will offer you more.

**Actionable Insight:**
Buy a copy of the Employee Handbook. Laminate it. Keep it on your desk. When someone asks you to do something risky, tap the book. Say nothing. Just tap the book with the calm, dead eyes of a jackal.

### CHAPTER 3: CHARIOTS OF FIRE
**Fleet Management, Mobility, and the Destruction of the Hyksos**

The Hyksos invaded Egypt in the Second Intermediate Period because they had superior technology: the horse-drawn chariot. The Egyptians were on foot. They were crushed.

In business, your Chariot is your **Company Car**. Or, if you are desk-bound, your **Laptop**.

**Mobility is Power**
The person who can move fastest dominates the battlefield. If you are still using a desktop computer that is chained to a desk, you are an infantryman. You are waiting to be speared. You must demand a laptop. You must demand a dongle. You must be able to work from a Pret a Manger.
* **The ""Hybrid"" Worker:** This is the modern charioteer. They strike from home on Monday, strike from the office on Tuesday, and are ""in transit"" on Wednesday. They are impossible to pin down. They are everywhere and nowhere. Be the mist.

**Scorched Earth Logistics**
When Thutmose III marched to Megiddo, he did not worry about being ""liked."" He worried about supply lines.
Control the supplies.
* Do you control the meeting room booking system?
* Do you have the master key to the stationary cupboard?
* Do you know the code to the photocopier?
These seem like small things. They are not. If you control the paper, you control the message. If you control the coffee pods, you control the morale. Be the Gatekeeper. If people have to come to you for a biro, they acknowledge your supremacy.

---

### CHAPTER 4: THE MONUMENT AND THE GRAFFITI
**Branding, Legacy, and the ""Paperless"" Heresy**

Ramesses II was the greatest marketer in history. He put his name on everything. Even statues that weren't his—he just chiseled off the old name and wrote ""RAMESSES"" on top. This is brilliance. This is ""rebranding.""

**The Hieroglyph vs. The Email**
There is a sickness in modern business called the ""Paperless Office."" It is a lie.
An email is sand. It blows away. A server crash, a forgotten password, a ""reply-all"" disaster—and your legacy is gone.
The Egyptians carved their memos into granite. 3,000 years later, we can still read them.
* **The Strategy:** Print everything.
If you send an important directive, print it. Punch holes in it. Put it in a ring binder. Label the spine.
When the auditors come in five years and ask, ""Who authorized the purchase of these ergonomic mouse mats?"", you will pull down the binder. You will open it. The dust will fly off like the seal of a tomb. You will point to the signature. You will be vindicated.

**The Cartouche (Your Signature)**
Your signature is your Cartouche. It protects your name. Make it illegible. Make it complex. A simple signature is easily forged. A complex signature implies a complex mind—a mind too busy with high-level strategy to form proper letters.

**Erasure of Memory (Damnatio Memoriae)**
When a colleague leaves the company, you must perform the ritual of erasure. Remove their name from the email loop immediately. Throw away their old business cards. Take their mug from the kitchen and put it in the dishwasher. They are gone. They never existed. Their accounts have been absorbed into your empire.

---

### CHAPTER 5: THE LONG SLEEP
**Surviving Stagnation and the Art of Mummification**

Sometimes, you do not get promoted. Sometimes, the Nile does not flood. The harvest fails. You are stuck in the same cubicle for seven years.
Do not panic. This is merely the **Third Intermediate Period**.

**The Natron Bath**
To mummify a body, you dry it out. To survive career stagnation, you must dry yourself out.
* Stop offering ideas. Ideas are moisture; they attract bacteria (criticism).
* Stop volunteering.
* Become grey. Become dry.
If you are boring enough, nobody will fire you. You are part of the furniture. You are a load-bearing wall. They might hate the wallpaper, but they are terrified to take the wall down in case the roof collapses.

**The Ushabti Figures**
Pharaohs were buried with small dolls called *Ushabti*. If the gods asked the Pharaoh to do work in the afterlife, the Ushabti would stand up and say, ""Here I am, I will do it!""
You need Ushabti. You need interns. You need eager young graduates.
When the boss asks, ""Who will collate this data over the weekend?"" you must have an Ushabti ready to throw into the fire.
*""I believe Simon is very keen to gain experience in data collation,""* you will say.
Simon dies so that you may live. This is the order of things.

---

### EPILOGUE: THE SOLAR BARQUE
**Sailing Into the Sunset (Or Retirement)**

One day, if you follow these secrets, you will board the Solar Barque. You will cross the horizon into the West (Retirement). You will have your pension. You will have your carriage clock.

You will look back at the office—that great, stone necropolis of wasted hours—and you will smile. For you were not a slave. You were a Pharaoh. You played the game. You followed the river. You made the law your Anubis, and you avoided the crocodiles.

Now, please, buy a second copy of this book for a friend. I have a garage full of them and the damp is getting in.

I struggled with binge eating on and off but recently lost a ton of weight this summer because I was limerent. Gained it back and more during the school year as I coped with the end of it and a ton of stress from school and binge eating and feeling unable to complete work/horrible executive functioning. Throughout the summer I was taking 30mg vyvanse and 150mg Wellbutrin and thought it was helping me not binge, but tbh I think it was the limerence mostly. As i continued to take this med combo during the fall semester I realized it was making me mentally more hyperactive and distracted and yes, gave me energy and a little euphoria but it was an artificial energy and I still was still unable to start daunting tasks. After talking with my psych she suggested I have adhd and switched me to 36 mg methylphenidate ER with the Wellbutrin.

This is only my third day in the combo but I’m not sure if it’s right for me. It makes me super sleepy when it kicks in and vyvanse did the opposite. I’m not really sure if it’s helping me focus and I’m not really experiencing the quiet kind thing, I just feel like my head is heavy and a little fatigued. Funnily enough the first week I took exclusively Wellbutrin a year ago, I felt like all my executive problems dissipated and my mind was eerily quiet (although it wore off quickly) so I was hopeful that the methylphenidate would do the same. I feel kind of flat vs vyvanse would make me kind of hyper and fun to be around… which I know isn’t what my brain needs but I miss the extra energy that at least allows me to get small tasks done like send emails and apply to internships. I’ve been taking the meds with a protein heavy breakfast and water, today I added coffee to see if it would help. Anyone have any insights or suggestions as to what could be going on or if maybe this isn’t right for me?",1,1768142912.0,adhdwomen,0,1.0,False

I'm looking for someone in a similar boat—someone busy with their own thing who gets that sometimes you just need that physical connection and spark.

About me: I work in tech, but my background's more interesting, spent years as a bartender and yoga instructor, so I've got that people-person thing down. I love to laugh, don't take life too seriously, and can actually hold a conversation. I'm fit, keep active, and genuinely enjoy connecting with people who have good energy.

What I'm looking for: Someone with chemistry and a sense of humor. Someone equally busy who isn't looking for drama or complications, just mutual attraction and good vibes. Could be regular FWB or casual, whatever works. Bonus if you can laugh at yourself and life's absurdities.

What matters: Real connection, honesty, and mutual respect. That's it. No games, no pretense.

1qa14hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNOLA/comments/1qa14hf/trip_report_huge_thank_you_to_this_sub/,Trip report! Huge thank you to this sub!,"Hi everyone! I’ve had this post written in my notes but never got around to posting! So my husband and I are two teachers from NJ and last year we just spent 4 days (Mon-Thurs) in NOLA back in April on spring break! It was also our 2nd wedding anniversary. This sub Reddit was sooo helpful in my planning so I wanted to do a lil’ itinerary review based on all the recs I found here! 

Hotel: we stayed at Hotel St. Marie in the French quarter! I told them it was our anniversary when I booked and they wound up upgrading us to a courtyard balcony room and there was even a bottle of champagne there for us when we arrived!!! The only issue we had was there was a very dirty towel in our bathroom but they replaced all of the towels immediately when we brought this to their attention. The bed was hard as a rock but we were so exhausted every night that it didn’t matter and we slept fine. It was super quiet at night we didn’t hear a thing! It was smack dab in the middle of the quarter and an easy walk to Jackson square or Canal street. Front desk employees were very kind and friendly. 

Monday: We landed around 3pm and took a $36 taxi (no wait at the taxi stand, so easy) to Hotel St. Marie. We got changed and went to our anniversary dinner at GW Fins. You guys… oh my GOD. No one on this sub Reddit is exaggerating. This was 100% the BEST restaurant we’ve ever been to. We had the lobster dumplings, tempura fin wings, the scalibut, and the salty malty ice cream pie. They even brought out chocolate truffles on a plate drizzled with the words “happy anniversary” on it. There was confetti on the table for us and a special menu with “Mr. & Mrs. \_\_\_\_\_” on it. Our server was amazing. I asked my husband a question and two seconds later our server pops up and goes “I can see you have a question” it was unreal. The restaurant is a well oiled machine. Truly this was the highlight of our trip. If you do ONE fancy dinner PLEASE do yourself a favor and book this restaurant. You won’t regret it. After dinner we took an uber (didn’t feel like walking a mile or waiting for a street car) to Frenchman Street. We went to the 30/90 club and the Spotted Cat Jazz club. Both had amazing bands/music! Def an older and more relaxed crowd but the vibes were great. 

Tuesday: We started our day off at Cafe Du Monde (beignets were totally worth the hype) and enjoyed the jazz musicians outside! Don’t forget to tip them! Then we walked to the French Market and explored that area for some touristy shopping. Next we walked up Esplanade to Treme where we ate at Lil’ Dizzy’s for lunch. Y’all… the fried chicken and Mac and cheese and yams were delish. Then we stopped at the Treme Petit Jazz Museum and listened to Al talk about the history of jazz music… his passion for music was infectious and was a cute little spot. After that we ubered back over to Sazerac House and did the tour and tasting. Sazerac is strong DAMN. That night we had dinner at Muriel’s in Jackson Square and I had some of the best shrimp and grits I’ve ever had! We went out on Bourbon St after and went to Cats Meow Karaoke bar and had a BLAST even though it wasn’t super crowded. The MC there (DJ Popsicle I believe is the name he goes by) was such a good entertainer we were loving it. I also had my first hand grenade and WHEEEEW that’s all I needed for the night!!

Wednesday: We took the street car to the Garden District and did a little self guided tour/just walked around and looked at all the pretty houses. Then we stopped at Parasol’s for frozen Irish Coffee and Po’Boys and both were so good— then walked around a stretch of Magazine Street. After, we ubered back (we were on a time crunch and honestly the Ubers were not expensive) to make it to our swamp tour with Cajun Encounters. I loved it!!! The swamp is soooo serene and unlike anything I’ve ever seen and we saw like 5 alligators!! That night we had a more casual dinner at Napoleon House where my husband enjoyed the jambalaya and I had the seafood gumbo and salad (very good, not great, but very good). After that we hopped around to the classic drink spots where we would order one drink and split it just to try all the touristy options (pat o’briens for a hurricane \~yuck, we hated it because it tasted like cough medicine… but the band was fun despite a much older crowd\~ to the vampire cafe for a “blood bag” \~ eh, tasted like a juice box with not a lot of alcohol\~ to Lafitte’s Blacksmith shop for the purple drank \~strong but too sweet\~ and finally we spent the night on Bourbon St again. We are both two people in our early thirties and we were enthralled by all the different options. We hopped around to a bar that was playing hip hop music, to a bar with a cover band playing classic hits, back to Cats Meow because we had such a fun time there the night before (all with a hand grenade in my hand again!! My nightly hand grenade felt just right lol) 

Thursday: we checked out of our hotel and ubered to BearCat CBD for brunch…… guys this was the ONLY true “miss” of the trip. My omelette was watery and the potatoes were insanely over seasoned. It was inedible. We left hungry. the only good thing there was the biscuits. Mind you this place has 4.6 stars we were shocked. After we were able to put our luggage in lockers and walk around the WWII museums for about 3 hours before having to head to the airport to head home! 

We loved NOLA. To all our friends and family who were like “ooh be safe it’s dangerous out there” I give a middle finger. We stayed in all touristy areas and always had our bags close and stayed alert. We had zero issues with safety. Even the unhoused people on the street would wish us a “good morning” as we went on our way. I loved this city and can’t wait to come back and explore all it has to offer!!!!

1qa12e3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SportsJunkies/comments/1qa12e3/another_moronic_jp_take/,Another Moronic JP Take,"There are a million examples where JP has such an idiotic take and so clearly would be the worst hang ever to watch a game with if you had a bunch of guys over. This is a couple months ago but he thought the espn bet app ending was because espn (as a media company) was covering the sports betting scandal with Chauncey billups and it was an industry they should step away from… Could you have a less logical gut reaction to stuff in life than JP? How clueless can you possibly be? Yeah dude espn is going to cut ties with a massive sports related industry they’ve already invested in because of a story that’s going to last a week. He literally sounds like my mom suggesting things.

Valdez immediately goes - Or it’s because it’s not profitable. If ESPN had $150M to make on that, they’re staying in that business. (Also ESPN was incredibly late to the party and ran a terrible app so 0 surprise to anyone that that collapsed. Also how does the ceo of Penn still have a job? Can’t keep one sportsbook upright)

For any regular Junkies listener, the JP comments are CONSTANT. 

Also can we get ONE interesting life story?? Here’s how most of them go: “I was driving Isabella to soccer practice around 4. Or maybe it was 3:30? No it had to be closer to 4 because we picked up her friend around 3:15. But her friend did live kind of close to the soccer field. You know it’s one of those house that sort of backs up into a park?” Like holy shit dude. And then he gets himself into some moronic situation where he has to drive to mechanicsville because Jess’s dad forgot a coffee mug at the rental house or something. And he’ll be like “guess how long it took me to get back home.” And I’m dying for bishop to be like - nobody cares. You’re a moron. Because no one has less patience for JP more than bish",0,1768142691.0,SportsJunkies,4,0.3,False

1qa1185,https://v.redd.it/blka3xv4fqcg1,My favorite Weyler scene 😍😍😍,"Yes, I know.... it’s been seen and re-seen, discussed, analyzed and analyzed again a thousand times, and ....yet I absolutely love their interaction. 

The atmosphere, the foreshadowing, … in a way, you can see their mutual interest forming in real time....even a certain admiration:

\- on his part: for her intelligence, resourcefulness, and eccentricity 

\- and on her side: for his integrity and unmistakable sarcasm.

I remember immediately thinking when I saw them meet: ‘Ah, that’s him, that’s the love interest.’ I didn’t think that for Xavier, nor for anyone else… and above all, the music. Their music. We hear it for the very first time. I love the melancholy that emanates from it.

Of course, there are plenty of other scenes, but this one....I don’t know.....it’s special. Maybe because I myself am an unapologetic coffee lover? And personally, if their final scene were the two of them having a coffee together somewhere… I think I’d be satisfied. 😍

1qa0y0n,https://i.redd.it/24a52f53fqcg1.png,Does caffeine make anyone else’s OCD worse?,"Hey everyone,
I’ve been noticing something and wanted to see if others experience this too.
Whenever I drink coffee or anything with a lot of caffeine, my OCD seems to spike — my intrusive thoughts feel louder, anxiety increases, and my urge to do compulsions gets much stronger. On days when I avoid caffeine, my mind feels noticeably calmer and more manageable.
I know caffeine increases anxiety in general, but I’m curious if this effect is especially strong for people with OCD.
Does anyone else notice that coffee or energy drinks make their OCD worse?
Have you tried cutting back or quitting caffeine, and did it help your symptoms?
Would really appreciate hearing your experiences.

I'm living in UK for many years I'm European originally, so I'd generally want to meet someone within flight or driving distance in the country, not afraid of distance and willing to commit to right person.

Something about me I'm single and forever alone and I hope to change that, just bad luck in life never had luck in love, I'm 5'11 or 180 cm, black hairs and brown eyes.

I do travel a lot by myself and want to find someone who is equally curious about world, especially history of our Europe, I love old cities and small towns, villages.

I love animals a lot especially Cats and Capybaras are my favourite, but I like so many of them it's hard to put all!

I do gaming so would be nice to have someone to do things together, mainly Battlefield, Total War: Warhammer, Resident Evil, Witcher 3, Bloodborne and many more.

I do love Tv shows and movies mainly Gothic Horror, Military, currently loved It: Welcome to Derry! I have so many it's hard to put everything.

And many more intersts like photography, history (medieval and renaissance, antiquity), music (I don't play anything just listening), books and I love coffee ☕ addicted haha.

I sincerely hope to find someone here after many failed attempts, I believe it can happen. I am looking for someone with good communication, who wants to voice call or video call often because texting doesn't get you anywhere from experience. I want real thing and commitment fully and make it real not just online thing so of course meeting in real is important, and also ready for relationship to build something meaningful.

I generally prefer someone who is between 25-37 ( don't mind age gap but not huge) ,i don't know what else, just hoping for good experience and something to change for good, would be happy to exchange pics during chat.",2,1768142310.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1qa0wbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catonsville/comments/1qa0wbt/this_morning_in_catonsville_said_a_lot_about_who/,This morning in Catonsville said a lot about who we are,"Last night, a few Catonsville businesses had their windows broken and some cash taken. It’s frustrating, and it’s upsetting, especially when you realize these aren’t faceless corporations, they’re neighbors who’ve built their lives around opening their doors for the rest of us.

But what really stuck with me was what I saw this morning.

Business owners were out early, not just checking their own places, but walking up and down the street to see who else had been hit. People were stopping to talk, asking if anyone needed help boarding up windows, sweeping glass, or calling insurance. There was a lot more concern for each other than for themselves.

That’s Catonsville.

It’s easy for stories like this to turn into something dark or dramatic online. Broken windows make for eye-catching headlines. But the reality on the ground this morning wasn’t panic or fear, it was neighbors showing up.

These small shops are the backbone of this town. They’re where kids get their first jobs, where people grab coffee, where you run into someone you know, where community actually happens. When one of them gets hit, it affects all of us a little bit.

What makes me proud is that nobody I talked to was saying “I’m done” or “this place is going downhill.” They were saying things like, “Did you hear about so-and-so?” and “Let me know if they need anything.” That quiet, steady way people look out for each other is something you don’t always see until it’s tested.

If you’re able, maybe swing by one of the shops that was affected this week. Buy something small. Say hello. Let them know they’re appreciated. That kind of support matters more than most people realize, especially after a night like last night.

Bad things happen in every town. How a town responds is what actually tells you what kind of place it is. And this morning, Catonsville showed exactly who we are.",39,1768142266.0,Catonsville,8,0.99,False

This is Willis Johnson's son (the founder of Copart) and from time to time, he will host an open house at his garage on Tally Moore Road in Columbia, TN - an easy drive just north of VGG. 

I'm telling ya - if you can coordinate a trip with one of his open houses, you WILL NOT be disappointed. It is an absolutely stunning car collection that spans 3 huge barns and a large outdoor area. Mind-blowing - everything under the sun in immaculate condition.

I feel that if a customer spends around $10 and then asks for a small cup of hot water, it’s reasonable to give it for free rather than charge for it.

On days where I have caffeine, especially later, my sleep quality is just worse compared to low or no caffeine days.

When I quit caffeine cold turkey, my sleep improved a lot. The downside was that my productivity when studying and working dropped hard, and I'd argue thats more important than training performance.

Because of that quitting completely was just not optimal for me. I have ADHD so caffeine genuinely helps me with executive funciton so I now just hard limit myself to one drink a day of choice; a coffee or an energy drink. 

What I’m curious about is how sensitive other people are to caffeine when it comes to sleep? I’ve noticed that if I have caffeine too late, my sleep either tanks or I can’t fall asleep at all, no matter how tired I feel.",2,1768141895.0,decaf,1,1.0,False
1qa0qyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/comments/1qa0qyb/anyone_gone_on_trt_due_to_gout_and_the_associated/,Anyone gone on TRT due to gout and the associated medications?,"So I’m newly 40. On KRYSTEXXA infusions. Been on prednisone, colchicine, leflunamide, methotrexate, folic acid, indomethacin for a year and a half now. (Indomethacin only as needed, so rarely, prednisone usually does the trick but in certain cases I’ve had to use it. I don’t like to though because I can feel it really stress my kidneys) 

I know this condition takes a lot out of us in general but ever since I’ve been battling this I’ve had low energy levels. My diet is solid, I weight all my foods and I know diet is only 10% of this so I’m not worried about that. I’ve done a lot of research and I’m not wondering about the diet piece. I’m wondering if anyone here has explored, with their rheumatologist, getting their testosterone levels checked. It’s been clinically researched and proven there is a direct correlation between low testosterone levels and this condition, let alone a potential side effect of all of those medications. I’m not here to argue about meds. I need them. Without them I wouldn’t be able to go to work. I’ve been flaring pretty consistently since I’ve been on KRYSTEXXA but after a year my levels are starting to come down. I started up in the 15/16s and I’m down to the 6s now. Still have visible tophi but no new ones. 

I head into my bi-weekly infusion on Monday and have an appointment with my Rheumatologist right afterwards. I have blood work done every infusion and the last time I asked him about test levels he said to go to a GP. Why would I do that, have to explain my life story and potentially have someone who wants to give me a wrong opinion when I have him, he knows exactly what’s going on, where I’m at and the fact their is a direct connection between this condition and low testosterone levels. Can’t he just add it to my panel he does every two weeks to see? Then maybe, if I need to, go on TRT. I’ll tell you what. Flaring constantly during this has been a struggle. I’ve somehow kept up with a 4-5 day a week gym routine in an effort to get my weight down after I gained 30 pounds starting prednisone. But I have no energy in the gym, I feel like I’m dragging constantly and it definitely affects my fiancée and I’s sex life. Now I’m sure there is probably an issue mixing steroids but I’m trying my best to get to a low dose and off prednisone and only use it for flares. But my flares have been that bad that for the past year and a half I’ve had to be on it daily. Just really wondering if anyone here has had experience with getting their Rheumatologist to test those levels, was TRT an option or were there other avenues you explored? How did you go about getting them on board? I feel like I shouldn’t have to sell this to him because the science is out there. Sorry for the life story. Just trying to give as much information as possible, I know we are all different and different things work for each of us so there is no one clear path on anyone’s recovery journey here. I’ve been feeling this low energy for a couple years now, there has to be a solution and unfortunately coffee just doesn’t cut it! ",5,1768141885.0,gout,4,0.86,False

It's such a struggle to balance life in this world. Maybe it's just me. I feel like I'm failing at everything sometimes. Work, family, friends, my babies.

Years ago my oldest daughter and I used to wake up before the sun every Sunday. The only day of the week my business was closed. I'd put the Alexa on a Spotify playlist, and we'd dance in the golden sunlight that bega to shine in through the Southern and Eastern facing windows. We'd make coffee for me, hot chocolate for her. And we'd sit on the kitchen island, gently singing along with the music and talking together. As she got older we started doing art projects during this time. Painting fairy doors we'd put outside in the zen garden I was building. Making shrinky-dinks. Sometimes just sitting against the island in the sunlight watching the light fragment over the hanging prisms.

When her sister started getting older she would climb out of her crib and join us. It was never the same but somehow more wonderful all at the same time. Each of us having our dedicated mugs. We started to miss weeks sometimes, life just getting busy, obligations getting in the way.

Nothing has ever hammered home the fact that we cannot hold onto time, quite like having children has. I cry as I fold up an outsized outfit and add it to my donation haul when the girls go through a growth spurt that lands them in the next size.

There's just never enough time. And, once again, maybe it's just me. But when I fall asleep at night and replay the day back through my head, I land on things that I said or did with the girls. Wondering if I'm doing the right thing, saying the right thing. Am I messing them up for life? Do they feel unloved when I discipline them. Discipline is freedom, something I practice in my life. But they are just kids so I try to make sure that it's an age appropriate discipline. Putting laundry down the chute, dishes in the sink after they eat. Maybe it's too much.

In the light of a cold January morning, the earth crusted with snow, we begin again. I went downstairs to get water and by the time I got back up they were sitting in my bed, talking to their dad. He was answering with his eyes closed. Our youngest bouncing at the end, alternating screaming random words at the top of her lungs and cracking up. Then calling me Mommy poopie-butt over and over again, the peak of three year old comedy.

I somehow get them downstairs, telling them to let Daddy sleep in. My oldest especially getting mad as she was in the middle of telling Matt an in depth, convoluted story about what happened on her field trip a couple of months ago. She follows me downstairs, a steady stream of words and tiny-child attitude.

Outside is brighter than it should be, considering the light grey happy sky. The snow is covering everything, making it white and fresh. The girls sit and fight like they've been doing constantly lately. That's mine! No, that's MINE! over and over again.

I want to bottle this moment in time, my body feeling warm and held like a gentle hug in the light from the curtainless windows. I can smell the Japanese incense that a friend brought back for me from his latest trip around the world, burning from the dining room.

Outside the snow starts to gently fall, Bill Withers playing on the Echo Dot. I close my eyes and send a deep thank you that no matter what happens to me I have this moment.",1,1768141854.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I’m reaching out to see if someone from the Black Rifle Coffee team can help me.

I recently purchased a product associated with Black Rifle Coffee, and unfortunately it developed a defect after a very short time of normal use. Because I’m located outside the United States, sending the item back for repair or replacement would result in high import taxes when it returns to my country.

For that reason, I’d like to know if it’s possible to receive replacement parts or guidance for a local repair, instead of shipping the entire item back to the U.S.

I really appreciate the brand and the values Black Rifle Coffee represents, and I’m hoping we can find a reasonable solution together.

Reddit helped me a lot with my preparation. So, I wanted to write my Step 2 prep journey which was a bit different than most of you. A little bit of background: my YOG is 2014, I am an non US IMG, a mother of a toddler, a full time working person in my home country. Unlike many of you, I took almost a year for step 2 preparation because I had to fit my study hours in between everything. I did my dedicated for 2.5 months. In those months, I studied approx.10 hours a day.

UWorld: 1st pass: 65% correct (completed in mid July) ; 2nd pass (50% done): 83% correct

NBME 10: 253 (10.10.25)

NBME 11: 250 (17.10.25)

NBME 12: 244 (28.10.25)

NBME 13: 260 (06.11.25)

NBME 14: 246 (17.11.25)

NBME 15: 267 (22.11.25)

Free 120 (2019): 88% (26.11.25)

Free 120 (2021): 86% (30.11.25)

Free 120 (2023): 80% (05.12.25)

Amboss predicted score: 259

Actual Step 2 Score: **268** (Exam date: 17.12.2025)

Initial Phase: I started my preparation at the beginning of 2025 and took a lot of time to finish Uworld first pass (mid July). In August and September, I couldn't study much.

Dedicated period: At the end of September, I realized, I forgot a lot of things due to the gaps in my prep. I started doing CMS forms which helped a lot filling the gaps. My scores in CMS forms ranged from 70% (starter forms) to 88% (later forms). I did last 3 forms from all subjects and did more from subjects in which I was weaker.

NBMEs and Amboss: I kept doing NBMEs in between CMS forms. In some NBMEs, I did great and in others, not so great. I didn't panic if the NBME went bad. I considered that as a learning opportunity. I took extra time to understand why my answers were incorrect and created differentials. I used inner circle notes in the topics where I was lacking. I did Amboss high yield stuffs. I also did their biostat but it was not that necessary. The other high yield stuffs were great.

What helped me the most: In the last week before exam, I revised all of my incorrect answers from NBMEs and Free 120s. I wish I could revise all of the NBMEs again but I didn't have time. That revision part helped me see patterns in NBME questions that I couldn't see before. At that time, I wished I had gotten more questions wrong.

Exam day: 1st 2 blocks, for me, were the most difficult. I am not a morning person and my brain was still not completely awake. I flagged at least 15 questions in those 2 blocks. But I stayed calm and took a 15 mins break. I had a strong cup of coffee, some protein bars and went inside. From block 3 the exam went a bit smoothly. I took a break after every 2 blocks. That worked very well for me because I had more time during breaks and I could relax and recharge myself instead of hurrying. My secret to stay focused till the end was green tea, It gave me a calming focus.

Question style: I found some questions to be very easy, and some questions were very difficult. The questions in between were tricky and I tried to remember the NBME concepts that I had studied in the last 2 months while doing those questions. That helped me pick the best possible answer. I made the mistake of 'thinking a lot and getting stuck' in the beginning blocks. The clue is to look for the catch words and pick the best possible answer based on that. The deeper you think the harder it will be to pick an answer.

I expected 250 but the actual score exceeded my expectation. I faced a lot challenges during the prep, so I felt really happy after getting the score. I didn't attempt NBME 16. I wish I did it. There were a lot of ethics and QI questions in the exam and I read in other reddit posts that NBME 16 is Ethics and QI heavy. So, don't miss it. I wish everyone the best of luck. Stay calm no matter what and keep practicing.",24,1768141701.0,Step2,6,1.0,False

Wir sind damals auf eine günstige Maschine gegangen, weil erstmal nicht klar war, ob eine Siebträgerroutine gut in unseren Alltag passt und ob wir Spaß dran haben würden. Klingt kitschig, aber ich freu mich jeden Abend drauf, morgens den ersten Espresso zu machen (Kaffee war aber vorher schon ein Ding bei mir, aber Filter = Aeropress und V60).

Jedenfalls: Alles macht Spaß und schmeckt auch so weit, zumindest als Americano oder Cappu. Espresso gelingt mir nur selten trinkbar. Lange dachte ich, das liegt an mir, aber auf dem Papier mache ich eigentlich alles richtig (frischer specialty coffee, routinierte Puck prep, passendes Wasser etc.). Habe mich dann etwas mit den Testungen der Machine befasst (siehe kaffeemacher) und glaube inzwischen eher, dass es deren Defizite wie fatal instabiles Temperaturmanagement sind, die einen leckeren und ausbalancierten Shot eher zur Glückssache machen (dass wir nur medium und dark roasts verwenden, versteht sich von selbst).

Über kurz oder lang würde ich also gern ein Maschinenupgrade vornehmen. Daher meine Frage an euch: Wer hatte auch mal eine Bambino und hat sich für ein Upgrade entschieden? Für welche Maschine? Welche Erfahrung habt ihr mit Geschmack und Konsistenz ggü. der Bambino gemacht?

***Thinking about staying at one of Disney World’s Moderate Resorts? I’m breaking down the pros and cons of these midrange hotel options.***

When it comes to Disney World hotels, the Moderate Resorts sit right in that sweet spot between budget-friendly [Value Resorts](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/disney-world-value-resorts-complete-guide/) and the splurge-worthy [Deluxe Resorts](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/disney-world-deluxe-resorts-guide/). Currently, there are four Disney World Moderate Resorts: 

* [Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/disney-history-coronado-springs-opens/)
* [Disney’s Port Orleans Resort – French Quarter](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/port-orleans-french-quarter/)
* [Disney’s Port Orleans Resort – Riverside](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/pros-and-cons-disneys-riverside-resort-at-walt-disney-world/)
* [Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/disney-caribbean-beach-resort-reviews/)

Each offers a unique mix of amenities, dining, and transportation that can make your stay more convenient and comfortable than the most affordable options, but without the hefty price tag of the luxury ones. Of course, that middle ground also comes with trade-offs…some you’ll love, and others you might find frustrating. Let’s dive a little deeper into both sides of the experience so you know exactly what to expect.

# Moderate Resorts Offer More Options For Getting Around

[Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort is the Skyliner’s main hub, offering easy transportation. Photo by Danny Shuster](https://preview.redd.it/b2mys3pwbqcg1.jpg?width=980&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=727c1d2b140e24ca32c2ee9cbbcdac50bb7fdc2a)

You’re probably planning to spend a lot of time at the theme parks – you’re at Disney World, after all! And, in my opinion, one of the great things about staying at a Moderate Resort is getting around is even simpler and (often) faster. 

Unlike Value Resorts that typically only offer [bus transportation](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/complete-guide-to-disney-world-transportation/) to the theme parks, water parks, and [Disney Springs](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/disney-springs/) (with a few exceptions), almost all of the Moderate Resorts offer at least two modes of transportation to get around.

For example, both of Disney’s Port Orleans Resorts have bus transportation to the theme parks and water parks; they also offer boat transportation to Disney Springs. Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort is home to the main [hub of the Disney Skyliner](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/disney-skyliner-map-how-to-get-to-epcot-hollywood-studios-skyliner-resorts/), which can take you to EPCOT and Disney’s Hollywood Studios, as well as other resorts.

Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort is an exception to this, as it’s a Moderate Resort that only offers bus transportation (but there are other major perks to staying at this resort we’ll mention later!).

With more ways to get around, you not only get a more unique Disney World experience, but it’s often much quicker to get where you need to go compared to bus transportation. With both boat and Disney Skyliner transportation, you don’t have to deal with any traffic. Plus, there’s almost never a long wait to get on.

# Bus Wait Times Can Be Awful at Moderate Resorts

While having more transportation options is a major perk when it comes to staying at a Moderate Resort, you’re likely still going to have to take a bus to get somewhere. And, unfortunately, travel times can be particularly long.

Disney World’s Moderate Resorts are large and, because of this, cover a lot of land. To keep guests from having to walk far to get to the bus stop, most moderate resorts have multiple bus stops throughout the resort. So, you just have to walk to the one that’s closest and wait for the bus. While this sounds great in theory, it can actually end up causing more trouble when getting to and from the parks.

Because the buses are constantly picking up and dropping people off around the resort, the buses aren’t really ever empty. This can make finding a seat particularly difficult, and it can even result in you having to wait for another bus to come if you’re one of the last stops and it’s already full.

All the stopping and going also adds to your overall travel time, meaning you need to plan in more time to get to the parks in the morning if you’re hoping to rope drop.

# Moderate Resorts Offer Bigger Rooms (That Can Fit Up To 5!)

If you don’t want to knock elbows with your family when you’re getting ready for the parks in the morning but don’t have the budget to stay at a Deluxe Resort, Disney’s Moderate Resorts are a great option. There’s more square footage in the standard rooms than you’ll find at Value Resorts, and many of the Moderate Resorts also offer a fifth sleeper option, giving larger families the space they need without having to pay for two rooms.

It’s also worth noting that nearly all of the Moderate Resort rooms have gotten some kind of update over the past 10 years, so they feel freshly revamped (and you’ll also find some fun nods to Disney characters and movies!).

# Everything Is SO Spread Out at Moderate Resorts

[Moderate Resorts like Port Orleans – Riverside are very spread out. Photo by Cliff Wang](https://preview.redd.it/lyh3bbv0cqcg1.jpg?width=980&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c95924ac461f9dafb5b4b6bb1f5b633fcfa1bda)

Like I mentioned earlier, Disney’s Moderate Resorts are pretty massive. But they’re also unique in how they’re designed compared to Value and Deluxe Resorts. Instead of having a ton of buildings piled on top of each other, Moderate Resorts are much more spread out. This ends up creating a more relaxed atmosphere where you aren’t facing a ton of crowds on your walk to your room.

However, getting to and from all of the hotel amenities can involve *a lot* of steps. 

For example, if you’re staying in a standard room at Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort, you’ll have to cross an entire lake to get to most of the resort amenities (unless you’re in the Gran Destino Tower) which can be about five to 15 minutes of walking, depending on your pace and where your room is located.

In my experience, this really only becomes a problem when you’re running behind at the start of your day and after a long day at the park when you’re returning to your hotel with sore feet. But, the tradeoff is your room tends to be much quieter!

# Moderate Resorts Offer More Dining Options

While Value Resorts only have food-court style dining and a pool bar with snacks, Disney’s Moderate Resorts are the next step up. At these hotels, you’ll find at least one [table service restaurant](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/disney-world-table-service-restaurants-best-value-disney-dining-plan/), a nicer [quick-service restaurant](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/best-quick-service-disney-world-hotels/), and at least one bar with snacks.

Having a variety of dining options like this so close to your hotel room can really make a difference in your trip, especially if you plan to spend a day (or even just the afternoons) at your hotel.

Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort is perhaps the best Moderate Resort to stay at if having a variety of dining options is important to you. This resort is also a conference center, so you’ll find even more spots to eat here including multiple table service restaurants, quick-service restaurants, a coffee bar with [some of the best drinks on property](https://www.wdw-magazine.com/best-coffee-at-disney-world-hotels/), a rooftop bar, and more!

The other three Moderate Resorts also offer a great variety, but each one usually only has about two or three main spots to eat.

# The Food at Moderate Resorts Is Heavily Themed

[Sebastian’s Bistro, like all Moderate Resort restaurants, fits the theming at Disney’s Caribbean Beach in menu and style. Photo by Danny Shuster](https://preview.redd.it/xj5xrvi4cqcg1.jpg?width=980&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2e9988f87c0d0f04b23b4483bde205c88f69e83)

You may have more dining options at a Moderate Resort, but if you’re traveling with a picky eater or have specific food preferences it might not matter. While you’ll still find things like Mickey Waffles for breakfast and chicken fingers and fries for lunch and dinner, the menus at the restaurants in each Moderate Resort are tailored to match the hotel’s overall theme.

So, at Disney’s Port Orleans Resorts, you’ll find more southern-style menu options, at Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort, you’ll find a Mexican-inspired menu, and at Disney’s Caribbean Beach Resort, the dishes are Caribbean-inspired.

This can either be a really great thing for you and your family, or a really bad thing. I recommend checking the restaurant menus before deciding where you’ll stay so you know what to expect.

# The Price at Moderate Resort Can Be Great… Sometimes

Moderate Resorts are the middle ground hotel option in Disney World and the price point matches that. So, while you are getting a more affordable nightly rate than the most luxurious resort options on property, you’re still paying more than you would for the basics. In general, Moderate Resorts run somewhere between $300-$500 per night, which can still be pretty steep when you’re planning a longer trip, especially considering most of the rooms have a “motel” style feel with rooms opening to outdoor hallways.

That being said, the Moderate Resort I find to be the best bang for your buck is the Gran Destino Tower at Disney’s Coronado Springs Resort. The tower is newer (having opened in 2019), the rooms are beautiful, and nearly all of the resort amenities are within the tower. All of this combines to make it feel like you’re getting a really good deal on a luxury Disney World Resort.

So, be sure to take into account all of the pros and cons before you decide to book a stay at a Moderate Resort. If you’re looking for something that has more amenities than the cheapest Disney World resorts and don’t want to pay Deluxe Resort pricing, then you can’t go wrong with any of the four Moderate Resorts!",2,1768141449.0,u_wdwmagazine,0,1.0,False

But I was never consistent. I’d sign up for gym memberships, follow complicated programs online for two weeks, lose motivation, and eventually stop. I wanted the identity of someone fit, but I didn’t have the daily habits to back it up.

Last year, I decided to stop looking for the perfect plan and just make movement a non-negotiable. I hit a 70 day streak of working out every single day without missing once. It is an amazing feeling to finally trust myself to follow through. Looking back, there were specific changes I made that took me from struggling to start to actually doing it.

1. I used to force myself to follow complex routines with heavy equipment because I thought that was the only way to see progress. That was a mistake. It made working out feel like a massive project. The biggest shift happened when I gave myself permission to keep it very simple. I stripped everything back to four basic bodyweight exercises: pull ups, dips, push ups, and squats. By focusing on these basics, I stopped feeling overwhelmed.
2. To keep the habit alive, I stopped trying my absolute best every single session. I made a deal with myself that the only rule was to do the exercises every single day. Even if I felt tired or busy, I would still do a few reps. The goal wasn't to reach failure every time, it was to not break the chain. Over time, what started as discipline turned into genuine enjoyment. The workouts became part of my daily rhythm rather than a chore.
3. I realized that the commute to a gym was a huge mental barrier for me. By switching to a home-based bodyweight routine, I removed every excuse. No driving, no waiting for machines, and no specialized gear. I realized that working out doesn’t require a dedicated facility, it just requires a small amount of space and the willingness to start.
4. I stopped worrying about long-term body goals and started focusing entirely on the daily win. I used a simple habit tracker to see my progress. Seeing that visual counter grow every day was highly motivating. It turned the habit into a game where the only objective was to keep the streak alive.

The habit has become so strong now that I don't even think about it. It is just the default thing I do, like brushing my teeth or making coffee. I don’t have a specific body goal, I just want to keep my body active for as long as possible.

If you are like me and you’ve struggled with fitness habits, try simplifying as much as possible. Start small, commit to every day, and focus on showing up. It eventually becomes automatic.

I wasn’t waiting, I wasn’t hoping, I wasn’t doing that thing where you say you’re fine but you’re secretly checking your phone every five minutes. Just me yelling into the abyss and then going back to my day pretending Im a functional human being who totally has their shit together, which let’s be real, I do not. I'm basically a potato with wifi and crippling anxiety.

And then you texted me. Of course you did. Not about anything important, just some random, dumb little message. Something I would have ignored if literally anyone else sent it, except apparently when it’s you my brain immediately forgets how to function. 

I was at work, trying to look like a productive adult instead of the chaos gremlin I really am, and then your name lights up my phone like it never left. And I smiled. Immediately. Like an idiot. Like I had zero control over my own face. I’m sure people noticed. They probably thought I lost my mind. 

We didn’t fix anything. Obviously. Just talking about literally nothing. And somehow that was enough to make my brain chill for like five whole minutes. Like, oh. There you are. You’re still you. This still feels like this. Cool. Great. Love that for me.

Nothing actually changed, and I know that. One text doesn’t erase the past or magically make me stop thinking about you. But it reminded me why you still matter, why other people just don’t hit the same, why I apparently can’t stop overthinking and laughing at myself while crying into my coffee. Annoying as hell. And hilarious if you think about it too much, which of course I did.

Maybe it was coincidence. Maybe you were bored. Maybe the universe saw me doing “fine” and said absolutely not. Probably all three. I’m not trying to read into it, except I totally am. Obviously. Can’t help myself.

Anyway. I’m glad it happened. Genuinely. Thanks for the random text. Thanks for the dumb, ridiculous smile I had at work. Thanks for reminding me that you’re still out there somewhere, still making me act like a complete fool. I'll go back to pretending I’m chill and unaffected and very normal about all of this.

Sleep deprivation made reality dreamlike, a thin gossamer curtain just waiting to be yanked aside. 

 

*“We left off on quite the cliffhanger, I must admit. When ghosts crawl into nonoperational satellites and bring them back to life, a story can go anywhere. It can turn into a romance, with dead spouses reconnecting with their grieving partners. Or it can shift into comedy, provided that the spirits are pranksters. It can even become a political thriller, for crying out loud. Imagine that, a murdered senator preventing the election of his assassin. Hell, I’d see it. Without the porcelain-masked entity’s influence, anything could have happened. But that bitch had planned for everything, and so we’ll keep our genre horror. Wielding specters like puppets, she kicked her efforts into high gear.*

 

*“But that’s getting ahead of ourselves. I’m guessing that you have some questions about the haunted satellites, and so I’ll try to explain the phenomenon. Bear in mind that I’m no scientist, so I can’t tell you the exact physics.*  

 

*“To begin with, I should elaborate a bit on the nature of ghosts. Ghosts are just energy, you know, an intelligent force acting over a length of space. Our spectral form is malleable, however, capable of acting mechanically, thermally and electrically. Because of this, we can cause a room’s temperature to lower one moment, and make the lights flicker the next. We can even set objects into motion, once we’ve learned the ability.* 

 

*“Our energy forms keep us insubstantial, and generally invisible. It is possible to solidify into solid matter, but eventually even the strongest specter will revert back into its energy state.* 

 

*“When the good ship Conundrum breached the Phantom Cabinet, it attracted much spirit attention. As the only solid object in the land of the incorporeal, it was an anomaly, one worthy of intense examination. Of particular interest was its communications system. Phantoms who’d never dreamt of advanced technology were able to study it at leisure, to figure out its capacity for near-instantaneous communication. Data could be sent across thousands of miles, as long as there was something positioned to receive it.* 

 

*“Now, transmissions from inside the Phantom Cabinet were impossible, as it exists just outside of ordinary time and space. But beyond the Cabinet, that’s a whole nother story.*

 

*“As mankind’s worst enemy—its darkest reflections given form—the porcelain-masked entity knew of satellites, and how a ghost could shift itself into pure data if properly instructed. From there, it could send pieces of itself from satellite to satellite, or even back down to Earth, using the devices’ transceivers and antennas. This allowed her spirit recruits to visit any place there was reception. Later, after my own Phantom Cabinet escape, I used these methods for a more benign purpose…this little radio broadcast.* 

 

*“Haven’t you wondered how your satellite radio is still running, when you haven’t charged it once since we began? That’s me. At one time, I could even manifest physically.* 

 

*“Like I said before, the ghosts could only manifest near Douglas, although their radius of activity was steadily expanding. So how, you might wonder, could they possess satellites thousands of miles away? The answer might surprise you.* 

 

*“You see, Emmett old pal, there were effectively two Douglas Stantons: the earthbound introvert we used to hang out with and the portion of his spirit he’d left behind in the Phantom Cabinet. Just as manifestations could spiral out from his earthly body, they could do the same from his spirit body, which propped the Phantom Cabinet open just outside of synchronous orbit. From any nearby satellite, they could project part of their consciousness wherever, while still remaining within range of Phantom Douglas. By keeping a toehold in that Cabinet-adjacent satellite, they benefitted from a cosmic loophole, allowing them to operate globally.*    

 

*“I hope that exposition cleared things up some, because I don’t know how to state it any clearer. Besides, it’s time to revisit the star of our story.*

 

*“The rest of senior year passed uneventfully for Douglas. He wasn’t invited to any other parties, and Etta and Karen never spoke to him again, but at least he wasn’t bullied.* 

 

*“Sadly, during these last few high school months, a romance with Esmeralda never blossomed. Although they shared a mutual attraction, it went unvoiced, leading to aching glances and nothing else. Each felt that the other had snubbed them, victims of a misunderstanding. Esmeralda ended up dating the football team’s star fullback, while Douglas…I’m sure you can guess. If he wasn’t drifting through the Phantom Cabinet, he was staring into a book or a television screen.*   

 

*“When graduation rolled around, Douglas didn’t even bother to walk. It seemed so pointless at that point, parading past rows of people who couldn’t care less about him, dressed in a ridiculous cap and gown. He doubted that there’d be any applause when his name was called, even if his father actually bothered to show up. Instead, he popped by East Pacific High’s front office a week later for his diploma, ignoring the secretary’s pitying gaze.* 

 

*“With humanity’s future being so grim, he knew that college applications were pointless. Either he would die, or the world would soon swarm with ghosts. Both options made higher education unnecessary. Instead, he took a minimum wage job at O’Side Video: working the register and putting DVDs in their proper places. Comfortable in his dull routine, he held no dreams or greater aspirations.* 

 

*“So let’s swing back into the final portion of our tale—just a few months after graduation—and learn what happens when spectral satellites go proactive.”*

*Donner’s Malfunction* was a popular half-hour XBC sitcom, aired at eight o’clock on Thursday nights. Telling the story of an IT programmer whose body shifted genders at random, it had bypassed the scathing reviews of critics to gain millions of American viewers. Its stars, a brother and sister from a prominent acting dynasty, earned half a million each per episode, enough to support their growing cocaine and OxyContin addictions. 

 

The sitcom’s current offering, detailing Donner’s attempt to win a beauty pageant as a man, had gone from the TV studio to the uplink station as per usual. From there, it was beamed spaceward, into the antenna of a three-axis stabilized communications satellite.

 

The program downlinked back to Earth, where it entered the cable TV network’s dish antenna, for distribution to its many subscribers. Simultaneously, the signal beamed directly to the private dishes of satellite TV subscribers, passing into their televisions’ receivers. This was especially true in the rural areas where cable had yet to gain a foothold.   

 

While the majority of satellite TV subscribers were able to chuckle along with the intended program, dozens of viewers were subjected to something entirely unsuspected: a face half forgotten, nearly unrecognizable from putrefaction. 

 

Shera Stevens had been quite the celebrity from the fifties to the mid-sixties. She’d started out as a department store model, before discovering a latent singing talent and starring in a number of acclaimed Broadway productions. From there, she’d signed to a major film studio for a series of romantic comedies, wherein she’d acted opposite many of the era’s leading men. The last of these was *War in Spandex*, an insipid piece of fluff she’d practically sleepwalked through. 

 

As many celebrities do when they grow too timeworn to continue as romantic leads, Shera had slowly drifted out of the public consciousness, eventually retiring from acting. After relocating to Paris, she’d spent her time shopping and learning to paint. 

 

Still, she grabbed a few more headlines when her body was found outside of the Paradis Latin theater, deep in the heart of the city’s Latin Quarter, still bleeding from sixty-seven separate stab wounds. She’d died in the arms of a stranger, gasping blood onto his custom leather jacket. Her purse was intact, still filled with loose currency, and the murderer had never been apprehended. Concerning their identity, speculation yet abounded.

 

On this night, her dramatic return to viewers’ transfixed retinas, Shera had a few things to say. In fact, she went on a thirty-five-minute tirade, bemoaning the state of popular entertainment and issuing a call to action, a plea for studios and actors to reconsider traditional values and well-written repartee. She closed by naming her killer, demanding that he be brought to justice. 

 

Later, an XBC spokesperson would declare the whole broadcast a joke, one in especially poor taste. He promised that the matter would be investigated and the responsible parties disciplined. No charges were filed against the alleged killer, an eccentric cabaret performer known for feigning epileptic seizures. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The next night, a few minutes before two A.M., hundreds of satellite radio subscribers were treated to a similar experience. Galactic Radio’s ground station beamed its digital data signal up to geostationary satellites as per usual, but something changed the signal as it bounced back down to Earth. Dozens of channels found their programming superseded with the warbling of a long dead rock star.

 

Thaddeus Constantine, singer and guitarist, had dominated radio and MTV in the late eighties and early nineties. First as part of Avocado Eye Socket, a pop punk quartet, and later as a solo musician, Thaddeus had produced a number of chart-topping singles and platinum-selling records. He’d also played himself in a handful of movies, and recreationally dated models and celebrities. 

 

His career ended in a trashed Milwaukee hotel suite, amidst a constellation of floor-scattered pills. The overdose of another twenty-seven-year-old rock star had produced quite the media stir, and shot his album sales into the stratosphere.  

 

On this night, years later, listeners were astounded to hear Thaddeus’ unmistakable stoned drawl pouring from their speakers. When he began playing songs they’d never heard before, many wondered if they were dreaming.  

 

Instead of a studio band, the dead man sang over ghost voices, aggregated articulations imitating a guitar, bass guitar, keyboard, and percussion section. 

 

While his lyrics had flirted with the topics of death, urban desolation, and existential despair during his lifetime, the dead Thaddeus Constantine had a new perspective to share with his listeners. And share he did, delivering a forty-three-minute performance so bleak, it made Lou Reed’s *Berlin* sound like the *Happy Days* theme song. He sang that there was no Heaven, no happy ending for any soul. He sang of the secrets held captive in human hearts, the darkest desires no amount of philanthropy can erase. He sang of abused children, of war atrocities, of self-performed abortions gone wrong. Thaddeus held a stygian mirror up to the human condition, constructed with poetic aplomb.

 

By the time that Thaddeus thanked his audience, and then allowed the preempted broadcasts to return to par, eighty-nine of his listeners had taken their own lives. Dozens of others went on to commit assorted crimes against humanity—rape and murder being the most prevalent. 

 

Later, after a recording of his performance was uploaded onto the Internet—to the delight of conspiracy theorists everywhere—the world’s suicide count rose exponentially, along with the number of violent acts committed. Indeed, the porcelain-masked entity’s plan was off to a prodigious start.

“Do you feel up to starting your job search today, sweetie?”

 

Missy appraised her father—bald, bearded, and seated at the foot of her bed—and tried to smile. “Maybe later, Daddy.”

 

With a furrowed forehead, Herbert rose to standing. “You know that your mother and I are here for you, no matter what happens.”

 

“I know, Daddy. Thanks.”

 

Herbert left the room, taking one last sad look at his bedbound daughter before closing the door. Missy was left alone with her silent guest, invisible to everyone else. 

 

“What do you want, Gina?” she whispered to the phantom. “Why won’t you leave me alone?”

 

White-haired and naked, Gina glowered at her surviving sibling. Blood ran from her slashed arms, disappearing before it struck carpet. 

 

While they’d never gotten along in life, Missy had never suspected how deep Gina’s hate reservoirs ran. Written across her marble skin was the purest abhorrence, the strongest loathing imaginable. 

 

Without breaking eye contact, Gina parted the deep gash in her right arm, pulling back epidermis and dermis to reveal the musculature beneath. Whimpering, Missy yanked the covers over her head, hiding the grotesque display. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

O’Side Video had once been a VHS rental shop, wherein tent-pole studio offerings shared shelf space with lesser-known indie works. Indeed, Douglas had visited the place many times as a child, whenever he could convince Carter to drive him. He still held fond memories of those times, of wandering the aisles and letting his eyes rove over cover art, clues to the films they adorned. 

 

Later, after Netflix and digital streaming rendered rental shops irrelevant, O’Side Video had shifted into a video retailer, selling the same sort of titles it used to rent out. This allowed the store to survive, and even earn a modest profit. 

 

Alone in the store, Douglas meandered through aisles of videos, scanning the titles, ensuring that everything was in its proper place. Past romance and horror, new arrivals and used DVDs, he moved like a sleepwalker, barely conscious of his own actions. 

 

Familiar beach scenes had been painted across the interior walls: waves, volleyball games, and sunbathers displayed in cartoonish embellishment, reminding each customer that yes, they were still standing in Southern California. 

 

With Douglas back behind the register, racks of candy filled his eye line. Time blinked, and a customer stood before him, clutching a horror DVD and a bag of licorice. Douglas rang up the purchases, counted out the heavyset teenager’s change, and bagged the items. Handing them back over the counter, he became aware of the fellow’s overwhelming body odor, a cross between onions and rotting fish. 

 

“Thanks for stopping by,” Douglas said with false cheer. “We hope to see you back real soon.”

 

“We?” asked the teen, glancing over his shoulder. “I don’t see anyone but you here.”

 

“It’s just what I’m supposed to say,” Douglas replied with growing impatience. “Let’s not make a thing out of it.” He nodded toward the entrance, silently encouraging a departure. 

 

And still the guy lingered, his corpulent face smirking, gawking at Douglas as if expecting standup comedy. The arms of his sweatshirt were streaked with dried snot trails; its shoulders displayed a fine dandruff layer. His complexion was even lighter than Douglas’, a pale, nearly transparent shade of white. 

 

“Is there something else I can do for you?” Douglas asked pointedly, now fully creeped out. 

 

Smiling, the customer tapped a forefinger against his bag. “Have you seen this movie yet? *It’s so cool*.”

 

“Yeah, I saw it.” The movie, titled *The Toymaker’s Lament*, examined the morbid existence of a former toy mogul, now living in a Bavarian castle. Its plot revolved around the toymaker luring visitors to the castle, drugging them, and turning them into half-mechanized playthings. 

 

Douglas had purchased the feature for himself a couple weeks prior, lured by its cover art and tantalizing back text. He’d been hoping for profound sci-fi horror, but had instead been subjected to a poorly acted piece of torture porn, a tedious exercise in graphic violence. Needless to say, he hadn’t revisited the film since.   

 

“Remember when the toymaker pulled that guy’s eyeball out and squished it? That must have gone on for five minutes. Man, my mom almost dragged me out of the theater when they showed that. I had to buy her a large popcorn just to calm her back down.”   

 

“Yeah, I remember. They sure didn’t leave much to the imagination there, did they?”

 

“No way, man.”

 

With that sad bit of male bonding accomplished, the customer strode out, leaving Douglas alone with his thoughts. Unfortunately, he had nothing new to contemplate, and his deliberations spun in long-familiar orbits.   

 

Minutes became hours, with the infrequent customers blurring together into one featureless consumer, leaving Douglas craving closing time.

 

Yawning, he counted down his last couple of minutes of shop drudgery. Normally, Paul, the store’s manager, would be responsible for locking the place up, but he’d bestowed that task upon Douglas, so as to attend to a family emergency. Only a dim sense of moral obligation kept Douglas from checking out early. 

 

When he heard the little bell above the door tinkle, signifying the entrance of yet another customer, Douglas’ thoughts grew murky. From past experience, he knew that whoever it was would beg him to stay open for just a couple more minutes, which could turn into a half-hour as they methodically perused each title. They’d lay some guilt trip on his shoulders—how it was their son’s birthday and they’d just gotten off work, or maybe that their cat had died and they desperately needed a pick-me-up—and Douglas, being a generally nice person, would pretend that he was in no hurry to get home. Sometimes, he wondered if their claims contained even a grain of truth.   

 

But the newcomer ignored the aisles, instead making a beeline straight to the register. “Hey, Douglas. Remember me?”

 

Staring into the olive-complexioned face of Esmeralda Carrere, he tried to hide his astonishment. She’d put on some weight in the few months since graduation, but not in a bad way. Instead, the added twelve or so pounds made her appear womanlier, with wider hips and fuller breasts. Frankly, he’d never found her more attractive. In her low-cut top and skintight slacks, she could’ve been a celebrity on her day off, or maybe some oil mogul’s trophy wife. 

 

“Hi, Esmeralda. You lookin’ for a movie…or something?”

 

“Nah, stupid, I’m here to see you. I heard you were working here, and thought I’d come say hello. Oh, I bought you a present.” From her purse, she pulled a Beanie Baby ghost, a cheerful-looking specter with an orange ribbon around its neck. “I was shopping for my niece’s birthday, and saw this on the shelf. It reminded me of our one conversation, back at Mike’s party. Don’t you just love it?”

 

Self-consciously, Douglas stuffed it into his back pocket. “That was…nice of you. I just hope your boyfriend doesn’t find out, and come beat the shit out of me.”

 

“Oh, I broke up with Marcus right after graduation. The University of Hawaii offered him a football scholarship, and of course he accepted it. I was proud of him and all, but what was I supposed to do, fly to *freakin’* *Hawaii* every weekend? It would never have worked.”

 

“Yeah, it would’ve been tough. Still, I’m sure that Oceanside’s entire straight male population is glad that you’re single again.”

 

“The entire straight male population? Does that include you?”

 

Breaking eye contact, his cheeks reddening, Douglas nodded. 

 

“That’s good to know. It makes it easier to tell you my real reason for stopping by. You see, I’ve been thinking about you lately…kind of a lot.”

 

“About me? Why?”

 

“Oh, come on, Douglas. You have to realize how interesting you are. You see ghosts, for cryin’ out loud, tangible proof of life beyond death. Dude, I came here to ask you out.” 

 

“On a date?”

 

“*No, I’m asking you to come out of the closet*.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Yes, I’m asking you on a date. In fact, you’re the only guy I’ve ever asked out. Usually, it’s the other way around.”

 

Failing at nonchalance, he gasped, “Wow…sure, I’ll go on a date with you. Where you wanna go?”

 

“You choose the place. This girl likes surprises. Here, give me your hand.” His palm soon sported seven scrawled digits. “This is my cellphone number. Call when you’ve decided when and where.”

 

With that, she turned and left the store. Douglas tried to do the honorable thing and avoid checking out her ass as it swished back and forth, growing ever more distant, but some things are too perfect to ignore. 

 

After his heart ceased its frantic beating, Douglas locked up, crossed the lot, and climbed into his Pathfinder. Leaving the shopping center, he marveled at his own good luck.  

 

Out of the blue, a beautiful girl had asked him out. She’d even bought him a present—albeit one he had no real use for. But what inspired the act? 

 

He suspected that Esmeralda’s actions were due to the influence of some supreme deity, trying to win him over so that he’d make the ultimate sacrifice. He could almost feel this force caressing him, whether Holy Ghost or something else entirely.

 

“Nice try,” he told it. 

 

Still, Douglas whistled happily as he drove. At the intersection of Oceanside Boulevard and College Boulevard, he saw a dead gangbanger waiting at the stoplight—complete with a bandana, wife beater, plaid shirt with only its top button buttoned, and tattoos up and down both arms. Between the angle the young man was standing at and his semi-transparency, Douglas could view a lethal bullet’s entry and exit wounds. The gang member’s back was a piece of abstract expressionism, indicating the ravages of a hollow point. 

 

Douglas waved at the specter, receiving an upraised middle finger in return.

12,000 miles above the Earth, slicing the cosmos at 7,000 miles per hour, orbited the Global Positioning System’s two-dozen satellites, each a 2,000-pound behemoth. Through the wonders of triangulation, a GPS receiver swallowed signals sent from these satellites, and used them to determine a user’s exact location. From there, the unit could provide directions to anywhere. At least, that was how it should have worked. 

 

When a disgruntled spirit bounces around medium Earth orbit, beaming from one GPS satellite to the next at near instantaneous speeds, disequilibrium emerges. Shifting into a spectral signal, an enterprising wraith can corrupt a satellite’s pseudorandom code, as well as its almanac and ephemeris data. When repeated over a group of Global Positioning System satellites, it is possible to weave inaccuracies throughout the system’s reported information—including driving directions. Thus, it came to pass that dozens of vehicles were directed to a rural Minnesota residence, located about an hour west of Minneapolis. 

 

The dilapidated house—little more than a shack, really—appeared years abandoned, with rotting shingles and walls beginning to cave. On a weed-swallowed lawn, a cross-section of Midwesterners stood perplexed, comparing complaints. 

 

Eventually, Danny Danforth—a portly fellow buoyed by midmorning Scotch—worked up the nerve to enter. Pushing past moldering furniture and scattered rat feces, he came upon an unfinished basement.

 

Inside the basement, Danny found forty-two corpses piled like firewood, accounting for nearly every inch of available floor space. From naked skeletons to early bloat stage corpses, the collection attested to years of serial killings, carried out with frenzied animosity. There were children and geriatrics stacked alongside those taken in life’s prime. Some bore the marks of human teeth; some had been partially dissected. The room reeked of putrescence, and Danny immediately lost his liquid breakfast, splashing brown vomit across the vacant, staring eyes of a ragged she-corpse.

 

The atmosphere assaulted Danny’s every sense, constricted like a full-body stocking. The room began revolving like a record on a possessed turntable. It felt as if the corpses were multiplying, their stacks rising to the mold-spattered ceiling. 

 

Desperate to escape, Danny backed up, retracing his path to the stairway. Tripping over his own heels, he felt his skull meet the concrete, blasting his consciousness into dreamless repose. This spared him the sight of one death pile shivering, dislodging a living man from corpse-sandwiched slumber. 

 

“God’s granted me another gift,” remarked the bearded fellow, rubbing sleep from his reddened eyes. Prodding Danny’s body with a snakeskin boot tip, he grinned mightily. “He’s a biggun, too, still breathin’ and everything. It’s a good thing he showed up. No way could I have dragged him here.” 

 

Jonas Fairbanks frolicked amongst his silent friends, pirouetting and skipping through their narrow ranks. His tools were upstairs, in what had once been a kitchen. It wouldn’t do to have his new prize wake prematurely, not when they had hours of fun before them.  

 

Outside of the crumbled structure, a woman now stood, a microphone held to her mouth. With her custom-tailored power suit, expertly snipped hairstyle, and well-bleached teeth, Erin Rodriguez looked every inch the reporter, which justified the news camera aimed at her face. 

 

“Nearly one hundred Minnesota citizens experienced a shock today,” she informed viewers, “after their normally dependable GPS units directed them to this remote location, well beyond the outskirts of Minneapolis. Never in the entire history of the Global Positioning System has there been such an incident, an occurrence that can’t be explained by normal signal degradation factors such as orbital errors, signal multipath, troposphere delays, and ionosphere delays. While the Department of Defense has yet to comment on this outlandish occurrence, we at XBC News are on hand to speak with befuddled motorists.”

 

Mrs. Rodriguez approached a smiling African American man, who swayed gently in a North Face parka. Her standard shallow questioning was interrupted by a commotion from within the house. 

 

Curious onlookers had surged into the residence, shuffling past its sagging, waterlogged door to learn what had become of the absent Mr. Danforth. From within their ranks arose shrieks and excited roars. 

 

Naturally, the reporter rushed forward, followed by her cameraman. Pushing bystanders from the entryway, they found a feral, half-naked lunatic lashing out at the six men surrounding him, defiantly brandishing a large butcher knife. Mottled by rust and dried blood, the blade was no less deadly as it cleaved empty airspace.   

 

“I’ll kill you all!” Jonas Fairbanks screeched, as yet unaware of the camera’s scrutiny. “You think you can interrupt a man at work, and then depart without consequence? Come to me, my handsome swine!” 

 

The knife flashed once, flaying cheek and chipping teeth. Jonas cried out in triumph. He punched his newly split-faced victim in the jaw and set upon another, a tall, Nordic brawler with his fists raised defensively. The others closed in around Jonas, contracting their positions, rendering escape impossible. 

 

The killer harbored no getaway aspirations, however. He was an animal dangerous to corner, and he’d go down as violently as possible.

 

A bank clerk named Everett Adams tried to reason with Jonas. “Listen, fella. We have no quarrel with you. Our GPS’ sent us here, and we’re curious as to why. If you’re squatting here, it’s really none of our business. There’s no reason for us to fight.”

 

“Lies! Deceptions! You creep into my basement, disturb my mute acquaintances, and then expect not to join their ranks?”

 

“Basement? What are you talking about?” asked another man, a bespectacled car dealer named C.J. McMurray. “Is Danforth in the basement? What did you do with him?”

 

Jonas turned and lunged at McMurray, his blade ripping the man’s cardigan, falling millimeters short of epidermis. Seizing the opportunity, the Nordic pounced upon the killer, pinning his arms behind his back, sending the knife clattering to the floor. A flurry of fists and kicks fell upon Jonas then, leaving him flopping on his back, too battered to rise. 

 

During the scuffle, a lone patrol car had arrived at the scene, more to check out the GPS-related hoopla than out of any misconduct suspicions. After viewing the basement, the investigating officer quickly called in backup, and Jonas was taken into well-deserved custody. 

 

Sixteen minutes later, Erin Rodriguez’s smile had turned genuine. A career-defining story had fallen into her lap, and she’d be damned if she didn’t exploit it to the fullest. Adlibbing into the microphone, she felt as if she could peer through the camera’s lens into the eyes of the couch potato multitude, millions of viewers hanging off of her every word.   

 

“What had begun as a curiosity now stands as one of the most disturbing discoveries in all of American history. And I am Erin Rodriguez, reporting exclusively for XBC News.

 

“When a select group of Minnesotans found themselves inexplicably directed to this seemingly abandoned structure, no one could have predicted the carnage contained within. Indeed, it seems that an undocumented serial killer has been operating out of this very home for quite some time now. 

 

“Not only were dozens of corpses discovered in the basement, but their presumed killer was still lurking here, waiting to attack curious onlookers. The maniac was subdued by the combined efforts of six brave men, one of whom suffered a gruesome cheek slashing.

 

“Parents, we advise that you pull your children away from the screen, as this recently captured footage may prove highly upsetting. Similarly, those viewers with delicate constitutions may wish to switch the channel for the next few minutes.”   

 

Shaking herself from the GPS signal stream, a satisfied Winona Tambor allowed spirit magnetism to return her to the Phantom Cabinet. Surrendering to its relentless pull came as a relief, as she’d raged against it for far too long. 

 

She knew that the man who’d taunted and brutalized her would finally face justice, that her departed shell would soon receive a proper burial. Winona’s mouth memory smiled as she let herself dissolve. 

 

Wasting not a second, a fresh spirit claimed her GPS stream position.

1qa0gpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1qa0gpm/first_lucid_dream_goes_wrong/,First lucid dream goes wrong,"I had a “lucid dream within a dream” and as soon as I said “I know this is a dream,” I lost almost all sensation (as if anesthetized), and then everything collapsed into itself.

I took a little nap after waking up way too early,or rather, after not being able to sleep. I drank some iced coffee at around 10 p.m. and went to sleep at 1:30 a.m., then woke up at about 6:50 a.m. and couldn’t fall back asleep, so maybe caffeine was what caused this weird event. After trying for about an hour, I finally fell asleep. It felt like I was passing out from anesthesia rather than actually sleeping. I avoided it twice, but then I thought to myself that maybe the caffeine wasn’t going to let me sleep normally.

My whole body was gradually losing sensation, yet my eyes didn’t feel like they were “turning off” or whatever they usually do when you fall asleep.

I somehow got teleported to my grandma’s house after opening my eyes in the dream, and I was aware that I shouldn’t be there because I should be sleeping at my own home (At this point, I was aware it was a dream because i was aware of being in the my home in the real world at that moment sleeping), but somehow I had gotten there, like I had sleepwalked and tried to sleep at their house.

I was sleeping sitting while laying behind a couch, between the couch and the wall (almost like how Golden Freddy, except my whole torso was disgonal and not only my head). There wasn’t much space, so my torso and up was almost crushed between the wall and the back of the couch. I was laying my head on what felt like a trash bag or a pile of clothes behind there. After realizing where I was, my grandpa came walking from the hallway with two black boxes in his hands, in a Tony Soprano type bathrobe. I transformed those boxes (since i could shape the dream to my liking, although that was the only thing i did) into pizza boxes from pizza I had eaten two weeks ago. That’s when I realized it was a lucid dream.

Somehow, he saw my feet. I could see through the couch, so I noticed when he saw me or my feet. For some reason, I had my crocs on.

He said, “Wait, wait, I can’t believe this. What are you doing here?”

I was still under that weird anesthesia-like feeling, so I had lost almost all sensation except for the left side of my face. At first, I didn’t want him to see me, but after hearing his reaction, I smirked and said out loud, without almost any feeling in my mouth, “I know this is a dream.”

As soon as I said it, everything collapsed instantaneously. Like in Outer Wilds when you break reality, but much fuzzier,almost like everything started dissolving. The only thing that didn’t dissolve much was the left side of my face and my body which had turn into a type of haze or smoke but was still there. I could coincidentally move the left eye of my face, so i forced myself to open it irl and wake up.

It was kind of like those old AI videos of Will Smith eating spaghetti or whatever where the video glitches weirdly.

What the fuck just happened?

It felt like some entity (or my brain) didn’t want me there after I realized it was a dream and not reality. It was kind of a lucid dream because I could briefly control my grandpa’s hand movements and what he was holding, but not what he said or did. After the “reality collapse”, and I felt myself plunging deeper into the dream world or whatever.

I forced myself to open an eye in real life because I was scared of falling into the backrooms or whatever could happen if you “dream wrong.”

It felt like that witch who tried to weaken Allah and got spiritually blasted because He was much stronger. (It has nothing to do with this, but whenever I think of that, I think of Ganishka from Berserk when he is in that cloud form).

I’ve seen that weird things happen when you tell yourself you’re aware in a lucid dream, but I didn’t expect it to feel this weird. Did I make it up from seeing a TikTok vide that said that, or does the brain glitch when you say you’re aware of the dream illusion? Or is it something different altogether? (God or something?) Is this common?.

TL;DR:  After speaking in the dream and saying that I was aware it was a dream, “reality” collapsed and my body did too. I felt like I wasn’t supposed to be there, so I woke up by opening my left eye, since the most intact part of my body was the left side of my face, and that brought me back to the real world. Is this a common ocurrence? It was scary butkind of cool tho.",1,1768141148.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

*“In case you were wondering, that eardrum-tickling tune was none other than ‘Ghost Song,’ by those gloomy rock and roll luminaries, The Doors. That’s right, you’re still listening to Radio PC, your home for…you know what, I’m sick of this DJ shtick, all this lingo and forced enthusiasm. Maybe I was better off dying early, if this was to be my future.*

 

*“We’re closing in on an ending, Emmett, and this routine is getting old. So I’m just going to be plain old Benjy Rothstein now. That all right with you, buddy?”*

 

Standing at the kitchen counter, with a coffee mug in one hand and a beer in the other, Emmett nodded. He was on his fourth cup of coffee and his umpteenth beer, their thick amalgam churning malignantly within his stomach. His eyes were bloodshot and his skin had gone ashy. His ears hurt, bookending a skull-splitting headache, and he no longer knew if it was night or day. Sleep deprivation made reality dreamlike, a thin gossamer curtain just waiting to be yanked aside. 

 

*“We left off on quite the cliffhanger, I must admit. When ghosts crawl into nonoperational satellites and bring them back to life, a story can go anywhere. It can turn into a romance, with dead spouses reconnecting with their grieving partners. Or it can shift into comedy, provided that the spirits are pranksters. It can even become a political thriller, for crying out loud. Imagine that, a murdered senator preventing the election of his assassin. Hell, I’d see it. Without the porcelain-masked entity’s influence, anything could have happened. But that bitch had planned for everything, and so we’ll keep our genre horror. Wielding specters like puppets, she kicked her efforts into high gear.*

 

*“But that’s getting ahead of ourselves. I’m guessing that you have some questions about the haunted satellites, and so I’ll try to explain the phenomenon. Bear in mind that I’m no scientist, so I can’t tell you the exact physics.*  

 

*“To begin with, I should elaborate a bit on the nature of ghosts. Ghosts are just energy, you know, an intelligent force acting over a length of space. Our spectral form is malleable, however, capable of acting mechanically, thermally and electrically. Because of this, we can cause a room’s temperature to lower one moment, and make the lights flicker the next. We can even set objects into motion, once we’ve learned the ability.* 

 

*“Our energy forms keep us insubstantial, and generally invisible. It is possible to solidify into solid matter, but eventually even the strongest specter will revert back into its energy state.* 

 

*“When the good ship Conundrum breached the Phantom Cabinet, it attracted much spirit attention. As the only solid object in the land of the incorporeal, it was an anomaly, one worthy of intense examination. Of particular interest was its communications system. Phantoms who’d never dreamt of advanced technology were able to study it at leisure, to figure out its capacity for near-instantaneous communication. Data could be sent across thousands of miles, as long as there was something positioned to receive it.* 

 

*“Now, transmissions from inside the Phantom Cabinet were impossible, as it exists just outside of ordinary time and space. But beyond the Cabinet, that’s a whole nother story.*

 

*“As mankind’s worst enemy—its darkest reflections given form—the porcelain-masked entity knew of satellites, and how a ghost could shift itself into pure data if properly instructed. From there, it could send pieces of itself from satellite to satellite, or even back down to Earth, using the devices’ transceivers and antennas. This allowed her spirit recruits to visit any place there was reception. Later, after my own Phantom Cabinet escape, I used these methods for a more benign purpose…this little radio broadcast.* 

 

*“Haven’t you wondered how your satellite radio is still running, when you haven’t charged it once since we began? That’s me. At one time, I could even manifest physically.* 

 

*“Like I said before, the ghosts could only manifest near Douglas, although their radius of activity was steadily expanding. So how, you might wonder, could they possess satellites thousands of miles away? The answer might surprise you.* 

 

*“You see, Emmett old pal, there were effectively two Douglas Stantons: the earthbound introvert we used to hang out with and the portion of his spirit he’d left behind in the Phantom Cabinet. Just as manifestations could spiral out from his earthly body, they could do the same from his spirit body, which propped the Phantom Cabinet open just outside of synchronous orbit. From any nearby satellite, they could project part of their consciousness wherever, while still remaining within range of Phantom Douglas. By keeping a toehold in that Cabinet-adjacent satellite, they benefitted from a cosmic loophole, allowing them to operate globally.*    

 

*“I hope that exposition cleared things up some, because I don’t know how to state it any clearer. Besides, it’s time to revisit the star of our story.*

 

*“The rest of senior year passed uneventfully for Douglas. He wasn’t invited to any other parties, and Etta and Karen never spoke to him again, but at least he wasn’t bullied.* 

 

*“Sadly, during these last few high school months, a romance with Esmeralda never blossomed. Although they shared a mutual attraction, it went unvoiced, leading to aching glances and nothing else. Each felt that the other had snubbed them, victims of a misunderstanding. Esmeralda ended up dating the football team’s star fullback, while Douglas…I’m sure you can guess. If he wasn’t drifting through the Phantom Cabinet, he was staring into a book or a television screen.*   

 

*“When graduation rolled around, Douglas didn’t even bother to walk. It seemed so pointless at that point, parading past rows of people who couldn’t care less about him, dressed in a ridiculous cap and gown. He doubted that there’d be any applause when his name was called, even if his father actually bothered to show up. Instead, he popped by East Pacific High’s front office a week later for his diploma, ignoring the secretary’s pitying gaze.* 

 

*“With humanity’s future being so grim, he knew that college applications were pointless. Either he would die, or the world would soon swarm with ghosts. Both options made higher education unnecessary. Instead, he took a minimum wage job at O’Side Video: working the register and putting DVDs in their proper places. Comfortable in his dull routine, he held no dreams or greater aspirations.* 

 

*“So let’s swing back into the final portion of our tale—just a few months after graduation—and learn what happens when spectral satellites go proactive.”*

*Donner’s Malfunction* was a popular half-hour XBC sitcom, aired at eight o’clock on Thursday nights. Telling the story of an IT programmer whose body shifted genders at random, it had bypassed the scathing reviews of critics to gain millions of American viewers. Its stars, a brother and sister from a prominent acting dynasty, earned half a million each per episode, enough to support their growing cocaine and OxyContin addictions. 

 

The sitcom’s current offering, detailing Donner’s attempt to win a beauty pageant as a man, had gone from the TV studio to the uplink station as per usual. From there, it was beamed spaceward, into the antenna of a three-axis stabilized communications satellite.

 

The program downlinked back to Earth, where it entered the cable TV network’s dish antenna, for distribution to its many subscribers. Simultaneously, the signal beamed directly to the private dishes of satellite TV subscribers, passing into their televisions’ receivers. This was especially true in the rural areas where cable had yet to gain a foothold.   

 

While the majority of satellite TV subscribers were able to chuckle along with the intended program, dozens of viewers were subjected to something entirely unsuspected: a face half forgotten, nearly unrecognizable from putrefaction. 

 

Shera Stevens had been quite the celebrity from the fifties to the mid-sixties. She’d started out as a department store model, before discovering a latent singing talent and starring in a number of acclaimed Broadway productions. From there, she’d signed to a major film studio for a series of romantic comedies, wherein she’d acted opposite many of the era’s leading men. The last of these was *War in Spandex*, an insipid piece of fluff she’d practically sleepwalked through. 

 

As many celebrities do when they grow too timeworn to continue as romantic leads, Shera had slowly drifted out of the public consciousness, eventually retiring from acting. After relocating to Paris, she’d spent her time shopping and learning to paint. 

 

Still, she grabbed a few more headlines when her body was found outside of the Paradis Latin theater, deep in the heart of the city’s Latin Quarter, still bleeding from sixty-seven separate stab wounds. She’d died in the arms of a stranger, gasping blood onto his custom leather jacket. Her purse was intact, still filled with loose currency, and the murderer had never been apprehended. Concerning their identity, speculation yet abounded.

 

On this night, her dramatic return to viewers’ transfixed retinas, Shera had a few things to say. In fact, she went on a thirty-five-minute tirade, bemoaning the state of popular entertainment and issuing a call to action, a plea for studios and actors to reconsider traditional values and well-written repartee. She closed by naming her killer, demanding that he be brought to justice. 

 

Later, an XBC spokesperson would declare the whole broadcast a joke, one in especially poor taste. He promised that the matter would be investigated and the responsible parties disciplined. No charges were filed against the alleged killer, an eccentric cabaret performer known for feigning epileptic seizures. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The next night, a few minutes before two A.M., hundreds of satellite radio subscribers were treated to a similar experience. Galactic Radio’s ground station beamed its digital data signal up to geostationary satellites as per usual, but something changed the signal as it bounced back down to Earth. Dozens of channels found their programming superseded with the warbling of a long dead rock star.

 

Thaddeus Constantine, singer and guitarist, had dominated radio and MTV in the late eighties and early nineties. First as part of Avocado Eye Socket, a pop punk quartet, and later as a solo musician, Thaddeus had produced a number of chart-topping singles and platinum-selling records. He’d also played himself in a handful of movies, and recreationally dated models and celebrities. 

 

His career ended in a trashed Milwaukee hotel suite, amidst a constellation of floor-scattered pills. The overdose of another twenty-seven-year-old rock star had produced quite the media stir, and shot his album sales into the stratosphere.  

 

On this night, years later, listeners were astounded to hear Thaddeus’ unmistakable stoned drawl pouring from their speakers. When he began playing songs they’d never heard before, many wondered if they were dreaming.  

 

Instead of a studio band, the dead man sang over ghost voices, aggregated articulations imitating a guitar, bass guitar, keyboard, and percussion section. 

 

While his lyrics had flirted with the topics of death, urban desolation, and existential despair during his lifetime, the dead Thaddeus Constantine had a new perspective to share with his listeners. And share he did, delivering a forty-three-minute performance so bleak, it made Lou Reed’s *Berlin* sound like the *Happy Days* theme song. He sang that there was no Heaven, no happy ending for any soul. He sang of the secrets held captive in human hearts, the darkest desires no amount of philanthropy can erase. He sang of abused children, of war atrocities, of self-performed abortions gone wrong. Thaddeus held a stygian mirror up to the human condition, constructed with poetic aplomb.

 

By the time that Thaddeus thanked his audience, and then allowed the preempted broadcasts to return to par, eighty-nine of his listeners had taken their own lives. Dozens of others went on to commit assorted crimes against humanity—rape and murder being the most prevalent. 

 

Later, after a recording of his performance was uploaded onto the Internet—to the delight of conspiracy theorists everywhere—the world’s suicide count rose exponentially, along with the number of violent acts committed. Indeed, the porcelain-masked entity’s plan was off to a prodigious start. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Do you feel up to starting your job search today, sweetie?”

 

Missy appraised her father—bald, bearded, and seated at the foot of her bed—and tried to smile. “Maybe later, Daddy.”

 

With a furrowed forehead, Herbert rose to standing. “You know that your mother and I are here for you, no matter what happens.”

 

“I know, Daddy. Thanks.”

 

Herbert left the room, taking one last sad look at his bedbound daughter before closing the door. Missy was left alone with her silent guest, invisible to everyone else. 

 

“What do you want, Gina?” she whispered to the phantom. “Why won’t you leave me alone?”

 

White-haired and naked, Gina glowered at her surviving sibling. Blood ran from her slashed arms, disappearing before it struck carpet. 

 

While they’d never gotten along in life, Missy had never suspected how deep Gina’s hate reservoirs ran. Written across her marble skin was the purest abhorrence, the strongest loathing imaginable. 

 

Without breaking eye contact, Gina parted the deep gash in her right arm, pulling back epidermis and dermis to reveal the musculature beneath. Whimpering, Missy yanked the covers over her head, hiding the grotesque display. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

O’Side Video had once been a VHS rental shop, wherein tent-pole studio offerings shared shelf space with lesser-known indie works. Indeed, Douglas had visited the place many times as a child, whenever he could convince Carter to drive him. He still held fond memories of those times, of wandering the aisles and letting his eyes rove over cover art, clues to the films they adorned. 

 

Later, after Netflix and digital streaming rendered rental shops irrelevant, O’Side Video had shifted into a video retailer, selling the same sort of titles it used to rent out. This allowed the store to survive, and even earn a modest profit. 

 

Alone in the store, Douglas meandered through aisles of videos, scanning the titles, ensuring that everything was in its proper place. Past romance and horror, new arrivals and used DVDs, he moved like a sleepwalker, barely conscious of his own actions. 

 

Familiar beach scenes had been painted across the interior walls: waves, volleyball games, and sunbathers displayed in cartoonish embellishment, reminding each customer that yes, they were still standing in Southern California. 

 

With Douglas back behind the register, racks of candy filled his eye line. Time blinked, and a customer stood before him, clutching a horror DVD and a bag of licorice. Douglas rang up the purchases, counted out the heavyset teenager’s change, and bagged the items. Handing them back over the counter, he became aware of the fellow’s overwhelming body odor, a cross between onions and rotting fish. 

 

“Thanks for stopping by,” Douglas said with false cheer. “We hope to see you back real soon.”

 

“We?” asked the teen, glancing over his shoulder. “I don’t see anyone but you here.”

 

“It’s just what I’m supposed to say,” Douglas replied with growing impatience. “Let’s not make a thing out of it.” He nodded toward the entrance, silently encouraging a departure. 

 

And still the guy lingered, his corpulent face smirking, gawking at Douglas as if expecting standup comedy. The arms of his sweatshirt were streaked with dried snot trails; its shoulders displayed a fine dandruff layer. His complexion was even lighter than Douglas’, a pale, nearly transparent shade of white. 

 

“Is there something else I can do for you?” Douglas asked pointedly, now fully creeped out. 

 

Smiling, the customer tapped a forefinger against his bag. “Have you seen this movie yet? *It’s so cool*.”

 

“Yeah, I saw it.” The movie, titled *The Toymaker’s Lament*, examined the morbid existence of a former toy mogul, now living in a Bavarian castle. Its plot revolved around the toymaker luring visitors to the castle, drugging them, and turning them into half-mechanized playthings. 

 

Douglas had purchased the feature for himself a couple weeks prior, lured by its cover art and tantalizing back text. He’d been hoping for profound sci-fi horror, but had instead been subjected to a poorly acted piece of torture porn, a tedious exercise in graphic violence. Needless to say, he hadn’t revisited the film since.   

 

“Remember when the toymaker pulled that guy’s eyeball out and squished it? That must have gone on for five minutes. Man, my mom almost dragged me out of the theater when they showed that. I had to buy her a large popcorn just to calm her back down.”   

 

“Yeah, I remember. They sure didn’t leave much to the imagination there, did they?”

 

“No way, man.”

 

With that sad bit of male bonding accomplished, the customer strode out, leaving Douglas alone with his thoughts. Unfortunately, he had nothing new to contemplate, and his deliberations spun in long-familiar orbits.   

 

Minutes became hours, with the infrequent customers blurring together into one featureless consumer, leaving Douglas craving closing time.

 

Yawning, he counted down his last couple of minutes of shop drudgery. Normally, Paul, the store’s manager, would be responsible for locking the place up, but he’d bestowed that task upon Douglas, so as to attend to a family emergency. Only a dim sense of moral obligation kept Douglas from checking out early. 

 

When he heard the little bell above the door tinkle, signifying the entrance of yet another customer, Douglas’ thoughts grew murky. From past experience, he knew that whoever it was would beg him to stay open for just a couple more minutes, which could turn into a half-hour as they methodically perused each title. They’d lay some guilt trip on his shoulders—how it was their son’s birthday and they’d just gotten off work, or maybe that their cat had died and they desperately needed a pick-me-up—and Douglas, being a generally nice person, would pretend that he was in no hurry to get home. Sometimes, he wondered if their claims contained even a grain of truth.   

 

But the newcomer ignored the aisles, instead making a beeline straight to the register. “Hey, Douglas. Remember me?”

 

Staring into the olive-complexioned face of Esmeralda Carrere, he tried to hide his astonishment. She’d put on some weight in the few months since graduation, but not in a bad way. Instead, the added twelve or so pounds made her appear womanlier, with wider hips and fuller breasts. Frankly, he’d never found her more attractive. In her low-cut top and skintight slacks, she could’ve been a celebrity on her day off, or maybe some oil mogul’s trophy wife. 

 

“Hi, Esmeralda. You lookin’ for a movie…or something?”

 

“Nah, stupid, I’m here to see you. I heard you were working here, and thought I’d come say hello. Oh, I bought you a present.” From her purse, she pulled a Beanie Baby ghost, a cheerful-looking specter with an orange ribbon around its neck. “I was shopping for my niece’s birthday, and saw this on the shelf. It reminded me of our one conversation, back at Mike’s party. Don’t you just love it?”

 

Self-consciously, Douglas stuffed it into his back pocket. “That was…nice of you. I just hope your boyfriend doesn’t find out, and come beat the shit out of me.”

 

“Oh, I broke up with Marcus right after graduation. The University of Hawaii offered him a football scholarship, and of course he accepted it. I was proud of him and all, but what was I supposed to do, fly to *freakin’* *Hawaii* every weekend? It would never have worked.”

 

“Yeah, it would’ve been tough. Still, I’m sure that Oceanside’s entire straight male population is glad that you’re single again.”

 

“The entire straight male population? Does that include you?”

 

Breaking eye contact, his cheeks reddening, Douglas nodded. 

 

“That’s good to know. It makes it easier to tell you my real reason for stopping by. You see, I’ve been thinking about you lately…kind of a lot.”

 

“About me? Why?”

 

“Oh, come on, Douglas. You have to realize how interesting you are. You see ghosts, for cryin’ out loud, tangible proof of life beyond death. Dude, I came here to ask you out.” 

 

“On a date?”

 

“*No, I’m asking you to come out of the closet*.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Yes, I’m asking you on a date. In fact, you’re the only guy I’ve ever asked out. Usually, it’s the other way around.”

 

Failing at nonchalance, he gasped, “Wow…sure, I’ll go on a date with you. Where you wanna go?”

 

“You choose the place. This girl likes surprises. Here, give me your hand.” His palm soon sported seven scrawled digits. “This is my cellphone number. Call when you’ve decided when and where.”

 

With that, she turned and left the store. Douglas tried to do the honorable thing and avoid checking out her ass as it swished back and forth, growing ever more distant, but some things are too perfect to ignore. 

 

After his heart ceased its frantic beating, Douglas locked up, crossed the lot, and climbed into his Pathfinder. Leaving the shopping center, he marveled at his own good luck.  

 

Out of the blue, a beautiful girl had asked him out. She’d even bought him a present—albeit one he had no real use for. But what inspired the act? 

 

He suspected that Esmeralda’s actions were due to the influence of some supreme deity, trying to win him over so that he’d make the ultimate sacrifice. He could almost feel this force caressing him, whether Holy Ghost or something else entirely.

 

“Nice try,” he told it. 

 

Still, Douglas whistled happily as he drove. At the intersection of Oceanside Boulevard and College Boulevard, he saw a dead gangbanger waiting at the stoplight—complete with a bandana, wife beater, plaid shirt with only its top button buttoned, and tattoos up and down both arms. Between the angle the young man was standing at and his semi-transparency, Douglas could view a lethal bullet’s entry and exit wounds. The gang member’s back was a piece of abstract expressionism, indicating the ravages of a hollow point. 

 

Douglas waved at the specter, receiving an upraised middle finger in return.

12,000 miles above the Earth, slicing the cosmos at 7,000 miles per hour, orbited the Global Positioning System’s two-dozen satellites, each a 2,000-pound behemoth. Through the wonders of triangulation, a GPS receiver swallowed signals sent from these satellites, and used them to determine a user’s exact location. From there, the unit could provide directions to anywhere. At least, that was how it should have worked. 

 

When a disgruntled spirit bounces around medium Earth orbit, beaming from one GPS satellite to the next at near instantaneous speeds, disequilibrium emerges. Shifting into a spectral signal, an enterprising wraith can corrupt a satellite’s pseudorandom code, as well as its almanac and ephemeris data. When repeated over a group of Global Positioning System satellites, it is possible to weave inaccuracies throughout the system’s reported information—including driving directions. Thus, it came to pass that dozens of vehicles were directed to a rural Minnesota residence, located about an hour west of Minneapolis. 

 

The dilapidated house—little more than a shack, really—appeared years abandoned, with rotting shingles and walls beginning to cave. On a weed-swallowed lawn, a cross-section of Midwesterners stood perplexed, comparing complaints. 

 

Eventually, Danny Danforth—a portly fellow buoyed by midmorning Scotch—worked up the nerve to enter. Pushing past moldering furniture and scattered rat feces, he came upon an unfinished basement.

 

Inside the basement, Danny found forty-two corpses piled like firewood, accounting for nearly every inch of available floor space. From naked skeletons to early bloat stage corpses, the collection attested to years of serial killings, carried out with frenzied animosity. There were children and geriatrics stacked alongside those taken in life’s prime. Some bore the marks of human teeth; some had been partially dissected. The room reeked of putrescence, and Danny immediately lost his liquid breakfast, splashing brown vomit across the vacant, staring eyes of a ragged she-corpse.

 

The atmosphere assaulted Danny’s every sense, constricted like a full-body stocking. The room began revolving like a record on a possessed turntable. It felt as if the corpses were multiplying, their stacks rising to the mold-spattered ceiling. 

 

Desperate to escape, Danny backed up, retracing his path to the stairway. Tripping over his own heels, he felt his skull meet the concrete, blasting his consciousness into dreamless repose. This spared him the sight of one death pile shivering, dislodging a living man from corpse-sandwiched slumber. 

 

“God’s granted me another gift,” remarked the bearded fellow, rubbing sleep from his reddened eyes. Prodding Danny’s body with a snakeskin boot tip, he grinned mightily. “He’s a biggun, too, still breathin’ and everything. It’s a good thing he showed up. No way could I have dragged him here.” 

 

Jonas Fairbanks frolicked amongst his silent friends, pirouetting and skipping through their narrow ranks. His tools were upstairs, in what had once been a kitchen. It wouldn’t do to have his new prize wake prematurely, not when they had hours of fun before them.  

 

Outside of the crumbled structure, a woman now stood, a microphone held to her mouth. With her custom-tailored power suit, expertly snipped hairstyle, and well-bleached teeth, Erin Rodriguez looked every inch the reporter, which justified the news camera aimed at her face. 

 

“Nearly one hundred Minnesota citizens experienced a shock today,” she informed viewers, “after their normally dependable GPS units directed them to this remote location, well beyond the outskirts of Minneapolis. Never in the entire history of the Global Positioning System has there been such an incident, an occurrence that can’t be explained by normal signal degradation factors such as orbital errors, signal multipath, troposphere delays, and ionosphere delays. While the Department of Defense has yet to comment on this outlandish occurrence, we at XBC News are on hand to speak with befuddled motorists.”

 

Mrs. Rodriguez approached a smiling African American man, who swayed gently in a North Face parka. Her standard shallow questioning was interrupted by a commotion from within the house. 

 

Curious onlookers had surged into the residence, shuffling past its sagging, waterlogged door to learn what had become of the absent Mr. Danforth. From within their ranks arose shrieks and excited roars. 

 

Naturally, the reporter rushed forward, followed by her cameraman. Pushing bystanders from the entryway, they found a feral, half-naked lunatic lashing out at the six men surrounding him, defiantly brandishing a large butcher knife. Mottled by rust and dried blood, the blade was no less deadly as it cleaved empty airspace.   

 

“I’ll kill you all!” Jonas Fairbanks screeched, as yet unaware of the camera’s scrutiny. “You think you can interrupt a man at work, and then depart without consequence? Come to me, my handsome swine!” 

 

The knife flashed once, flaying cheek and chipping teeth. Jonas cried out in triumph. He punched his newly split-faced victim in the jaw and set upon another, a tall, Nordic brawler with his fists raised defensively. The others closed in around Jonas, contracting their positions, rendering escape impossible. 

 

The killer harbored no getaway aspirations, however. He was an animal dangerous to corner, and he’d go down as violently as possible.

 

A bank clerk named Everett Adams tried to reason with Jonas. “Listen, fella. We have no quarrel with you. Our GPS’ sent us here, and we’re curious as to why. If you’re squatting here, it’s really none of our business. There’s no reason for us to fight.”

 

“Lies! Deceptions! You creep into my basement, disturb my mute acquaintances, and then expect not to join their ranks?”

 

“Basement? What are you talking about?” asked another man, a bespectacled car dealer named C.J. McMurray. “Is Danforth in the basement? What did you do with him?”

 

Jonas turned and lunged at McMurray, his blade ripping the man’s cardigan, falling millimeters short of epidermis. Seizing the opportunity, the Nordic pounced upon the killer, pinning his arms behind his back, sending the knife clattering to the floor. A flurry of fists and kicks fell upon Jonas then, leaving him flopping on his back, too battered to rise. 

 

During the scuffle, a lone patrol car had arrived at the scene, more to check out the GPS-related hoopla than out of any misconduct suspicions. After viewing the basement, the investigating officer quickly called in backup, and Jonas was taken into well-deserved custody. 

 

Sixteen minutes later, Erin Rodriguez’s smile had turned genuine. A career-defining story had fallen into her lap, and she’d be damned if she didn’t exploit it to the fullest. Adlibbing into the microphone, she felt as if she could peer through the camera’s lens into the eyes of the couch potato multitude, millions of viewers hanging off of her every word.   

 

“What had begun as a curiosity now stands as one of the most disturbing discoveries in all of American history. And I am Erin Rodriguez, reporting exclusively for XBC News.

 

“When a select group of Minnesotans found themselves inexplicably directed to this seemingly abandoned structure, no one could have predicted the carnage contained within. Indeed, it seems that an undocumented serial killer has been operating out of this very home for quite some time now. 

 

“Not only were dozens of corpses discovered in the basement, but their presumed killer was still lurking here, waiting to attack curious onlookers. The maniac was subdued by the combined efforts of six brave men, one of whom suffered a gruesome cheek slashing.

 

“Parents, we advise that you pull your children away from the screen, as this recently captured footage may prove highly upsetting. Similarly, those viewers with delicate constitutions may wish to switch the channel for the next few minutes.”   

 

Shaking herself from the GPS signal stream, a satisfied Winona Tambor allowed spirit magnetism to return her to the Phantom Cabinet. Surrendering to its relentless pull came as a relief, as she’d raged against it for far too long. 

 

She knew that the man who’d taunted and brutalized her would finally face justice, that her departed shell would soon receive a proper burial. Winona’s mouth memory smiled as she let herself dissolve. 

 

Wasting not a second, a fresh spirit claimed her GPS stream position.

1qa0g12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ask_political_science/comments/1qa0g12/should_we_be_concerned_about_energy_drink/,"Should we be concerned about energy drink consumption becoming normal, or is this just generational moral panic?","My younger coworkers regularly consume drink monster and other energy drinks as casual beverages, not just for occasional energy needs. They're drinking stimulant-heavy drinks with sugar or artificial sweeteners as regularly as previous generations drank soda. Is this a legitimate health concern or just older people being uncomfortable with younger habits? The health arguments are real, high caffeine, sugar content, unknown long-term effects of regular consumption. But coffee has similar caffeine levels and we treat that as socially acceptable. The difference might be more about familiarity and what each generation normalized. Every generation has their concerning consumption patterns that eventually become accepted or fade away.
I've researched energy drink health impacts, finding concerning data about cardiovascular effects and dependency development. But I also recognize my discomfort might be partly just unfamiliarity and different from my generation's habits. Some beverage suppliers on Alibaba sell energy drink components in bulk, showing this is an established massive industry. What consumption habits concern you in younger generations? Can you distinguish between legitimate worries and just generational differences? What habits of yours did older people criticize that you defended? How do you evaluate whether new products or patterns are genuinely harmful versus just different?",1,1768141098.0,ask_political_science,1,1.0,False

I’ve paired it with a new canvas strap that’s better suited for daily wear.

The work was done by my local watchmaker rather than Nomos. It was a bit more expensive, but I’m more than happy to pay a little extra to support an honest, skilled independent watchmaker.",20,1768141006.0,Nomos,6,0.96,False
