I love watching streams of MMBN 6 PVP.   
Love isn't a strong enough word. I'm addicted. N1GP is basically always playing on my TV, and when I burn through their videos, I get hungry for anything else I can find.

And that's when I noticed a massive problem. Other streams are often played locally, which is great! But Megaman PVP, despite having roots in local play, really is struggling in a Wifi world.

Dropped connections or lag constantly plague the streams I've seen of local tourneys, and while the switch legacy collection is great, it also introduced some new issues. Those problems combined with the wifi drops in tourney locations where the wifi is spotty due to overlapping wifi connections or even no wifi at all, such as a convention, or coffee shop, or what have you, make it frustrating to watch, so I can't even imagine how the players must feel.

Tango > requires internet/wifi

Retroarch Netplay(gbsp) > Requires internet/wifi

Steam > Requires internet/wifi, signing into accounts, no 100% saves

Switch > requires console/specific Tokyo Drift controllers, requires internet/wifi, no 100% saves

Well, there is a simple solution that doesn't need internet or a wifi router. 

Local Megaman PVP, using a single machine with no wifi needed.   


\*\*Warning, I suck at formatting and while the steps are not long or complicated, I am embarrassingly long winded.\*\*



What do I need?

	The following hardware:

1: Controller per player (2). Players may bring the own controller provided macros, ect. are not used. 

2: Windows Laptop/desktop. (outlet plug access for windows laptop/desktop) (Bluetooth access and 3 usb slots needed)

3: Monitor to act as second screen for windows laptop/desktop. (outlet access for plug)

4: HDMI cable to connect Monitor to windows device

5: Some form of speaker, bluetooth/wired/laptop speaker/monitor, whatever for game audio.

6: additional laptop would allow players to make their folders faster if needed. 

	The following software:

1: Tango (https://tango.n1gp.net/)

2: mGBA (https://mgba.io/) (portable download was used in this example)

3: If streaming, your streaming software of choice. (I don't stream so idk how this will work for you)

Step One:

[Added a Saves Folder and Roms Folder](https://preview.redd.it/khhabqefxnne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1659fb1b9e5bbd316565996f43b0409911dafe6)

Download the mgba portable, download tango, set both up.

Tango is prepared only for the ability to create additional folders for players.

MGBA folder set up for easy and quick access to rom/saves. This means a separate folder for Roms and a separate folder for Saves. Since we are using the portable version of mGBA, we can place the folders right in the main mGBA folder, and move the entire mGBA folder to where ever we need it to be, including moving it between machines.

mGBA settings are prepared, though there shouldn't be much needed to be changed other than audio volume, audio per window can be controlled by muting a specific window in mGBA, more on that later. Controller inputs will be added later.

Player folder game saves will need to be renamed. We need to easily identify the player's name, the rom game type (FAL/GREG), and if the player has multiple saves, someone to identify them (Such as/qforce/Deltaray/ect)

Saves from players submitted online should be downloaded and placed in the Saves folder ready to go. Tango saves work with no changes to name or file type. 

Step Two:

Creating and copying over your Tango saves.

Tango will be used to CREATE 100% saves for each player. (and make a clipboardable image of your navicust if needed.) It is NOT used to actually play the game. Each player can make a save on the spot using Tango, or ahead of time and submit it to the host. If ahead of time, players may bring the own saves via Flash Drive, or submit it via online to the Tourney Host. Tango has a folder button you can click to access all of your saves. This can be used if someone shows up without a folder build for the game and needs to make one on the fly.

[Create save, make your build, and use the open folder button to quickly have access. Rename as needed.](https://preview.redd.it/4qeyxc5bxnne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=176c375891d5d79848ad31afa8fe2eb5a712cde8)

Copy the saves into the mGBA portable folder you set up for saves. 

Step Three:

Launch mGba. In my screenshots I will be using a single monitor set up, with keyboard controls for player 2, and my 8bitdo controller for player 1.

Assume you as the host will be using multiple screens to keep screen peeking from happening. Assume host has already set up audio/hdmi/second screen.

second screen should be in ""extended"" not duplicated mode.

On mGBA click file>load rom.

https://preview.redd.it/l4rguxi6ynne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1d10dc8d796e09bfb148011d3fd384b4ded086b

Load the rom that matches the tango save for player one.

[By having a rom folder in the mGba folder tree, it's close by and right at hand](https://preview.redd.it/0vc6hn08ynne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbb9634d91998b7522b87f8a24ccdaab457888d2)

Once the game loads, on mGBA click file>load save game, load alternate save game.

[When we launch mGba with a rom it is making it's own new save, we want to load or special 100&#37; one.](https://preview.redd.it/ncbh1zibynne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac467c8e2fc26ca0c8b02557c7395dd0a696d228)

Select your save from your (conveniently nearby) save folder. game will relaunch with the new save. pressing start conforms when you see the menu icons.

[\*Note, always launch the Original save for the game, as mGBA will make a new one each time you connect to a player. It doesn't really make a difference, but it will be way easier to find the original saves for each player in their special folder we made.](https://preview.redd.it/rgunzbtdynne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfd51d650aaa60d012f350eb775ba93ab4715a35)

Step Four:

Click File > new multiplayer window.

[This will open a new window. hover your mouse over mGBA on the bottom bar if you can't find it.](https://preview.redd.it/8izo3ssiynne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=c75b46555b906894bdf693628f4df8ce693a9d6e)

Repeat steps on new window but with the other players game choice and save.

In my example I use gregar and falzar to ensure both worked (Some emulators required you to use the EXACT same game rom, meaning only gregar vs gregar and fal vs fal).

Finally, in each window click file > Tools > Settings > Controllers.

Ensure each player has their correct controller identified by the drop down menu. a refresh button can be used if controller is not seen.

Then each player may match the controls to their liking. click the control, then click the correct button on the controller you would like to use (for example which of the face buttons will be A vs B)  
(In my example I am using controller vs keyboard as I don't have a second controller available.)

\*Windows supports joycons as single controller, though it requires more set up. so you can still use your switch controllers if you want. Google around and you'll find how to do it.

[If you have two controllers set up ahead of time, players can just use that. But for players who wish to bring their own controller from home \(for that sweet sweet muscle memory\) Here is where they can select their controller and set up the buttons](https://preview.redd.it/huescfnoynne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b82896fb918bbfd478d2510e4783354fa11c2b5)

Step Five:

Set both windows to fullscreen on their respective monitor, or just make them fill the screen of the respective monitor.

In my example I am using one screen, so I have them both as large as they can be, side by side. it does not matter which window is selected, the controller inputs will work with their respective window regardless.

[Note the player id on the top bar of each window](https://preview.redd.it/uaugclidznne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=a45e2f44b778f116ec73495378a6e6f6edfb5ec3)

Once each player has hit continue > start > com > ect to battle, make sure Link Cable is selected, triple battle, and Practice.

Double check whatever streaming program you use to ensure this all works with it. as I mentioned, I don't do any streaming so I don't have any idea what that looks like from Host side.

Double check your audio set up. As mentioned, you can mute one of the windows using mGBA or, whatever works for your personal set up.

https://preview.redd.it/wf0ruxmfznne1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=6094befee5fe19406dd4c53b0d5c0a04e39371a9

Step Five:

Battle start! You can now let the players begin. when the battle is over, you can hit file > Load rom (or save if correct rom is loaded) and get right back to it. (after re setting up new players controller)

https://preview.redd.it/i4esz6a10one1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd82299859840b176acd81cca846a18e9043d311

That's all there is to it. Local play, single machine, no wifi or internet needed.

Finally, Smoother tourneys in places where wifi is spotty or not available.   
Most importantly, more MMBN PVP for me to watch.   
And really, isn't that all that matters?

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

But what makes Kendu stand out and why are you reading these lines?

First, the EXCEPTIONAL community. Second, the work culture. Third, the real-world products and businesses. And finally, the lore and longevity of Kendu!

# 1. The community:

Many members are active every day on Telegram, discussing, creating, and strengthening friendships and bonds. They tirelessly shill Kendu on X, share more detailed information about Kendu on Reddit, and are active on many other online platforms daily.

There is a real sense of love and camaraderie among the members.

# 2. The work culture:

From the very beginning, a strong work culture was established within the Kendu community. ""We don‚Äôt gamble, we work."" Most members work relentlessly and have understood that they are in charge of their own success. There‚Äôs no waiting, no ""wen,"" and we don‚Äôt rely solely on luck. We will continue to develop and create, with no limits on time or power.

Better having 10 loyal workers than 100 short term gamblers.

# 3. Real-world products and businesses:

With this ethos, some members have already launched products sold in the real world under the Kendu brand. Energy drinks, coffee, clothing, events, chewing gum, jewelry, and many other products are in the works. The community promotes and consumes these products, with some members even directly assisting in their development. We are talking about the first global brand for everyone, with no limits on skills, borders, etc.

# 4. An exceptional lore that has made Kendu indestructible:

As I write these lines, Kendu is already over a year old! Memecoins with such an active and enthusiastic community after a year, especially during this depressed market (early 2025), are truly exceptional.

The way the community took over (CTO) against the scammer original dev is simply amazing. It was epic and deserves a Netflix documentary!

**To conclude,** Kendu has gone through a significant retracement over several months, dropping from its ATH of 280 million to 7 million right after the CTO. This is due to the original developer selling a lot over these months, PLUS one very large whale who sold even more tokens. However, the community has continued to grow, strengthen the project, and buy back regularly. Once the redistribution is completed, the pump will be as exceptional as Kendu itself.

I‚Äôm talking about logic here.

Kendu is the next form of a global community company. Crypto hasn‚Äôt finished delivering crazy things for humanity!

Every morning lately I‚Äôve been doing saffron extract and turmeric curcumin (Qunol brand from Costco). Sometimes I‚Äôll put a little cbd in my coffee at the same time, or take black ginger and cyanidin 3 glucoside/C3G for the thermogenic effects. I also often take l theanine in the morning. 

Today I was reading that curcumin can block a specific enzyme that breaks down other drugs/supplements, while the black pepper actually increases absorption‚Ä¶ which to me, makes it seem like it could have the dual effect of both blocking the breakdown of other substances while at the same time increasing their absorption.

In fact, the enzyme it blocks is the same enzyme that breaks down CBD. üò¨

So here‚Äôs my question: should I space out my turmeric curcumin from other supplements by x number of hours?

I was interested in taking ND‚Äôs ECGC extract but I know in high doses it‚Äôs been linked to liver damage and I don‚Äôt want the curcumin to cause it to increase too much in my body and cause that.

1. The idea itself‚Äîdoes this solve a problem you‚Äôve faced?
2. The UI/UX‚Äîis it intuitive, or does it feel clunky?
3. The pricing‚Äîis it fair, or would you pay more/less?

Here‚Äôs what I need

- about 50% of the week its both of us here all morning. So around 1L brewed should be enough - two cups when we get up, two more later in the morning but at variable times - I‚Äôm normally around two hours after the first, my wife maybe up to 3 hours max. 
- the other 50% of the week its three cups as my wife goes to work and she can use their coffee to save a few pennies. so either we brew 750ml and I leave a tiny 250ml in the bottom of the carafe which I am sure will cool too much even with a thermal carafe, or possibly just pour it into a travel mug to keep warm for later that morning. 

so first - given the volumes, should I consider the half flow option to be an essential, or not worry too much about it? that significantly limits my options if thats non-negotiable. 

second - thermal vs glass? on 1L days thermal sounds convenient, but not seeing how much is left might be difficult if you‚Äôre last one standing you may not get enough. Glass its easy to see how much is left. and it wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world to just buy a little thermal carafe separately, and preheat it with hot water while the moccamaster is brewing and then pour the leftovers into it for later.

1. We're in Scotland (im scottish), but he's from the USA and on a spouse visa. 1 year into a 5 year path to permanent residency. If we fully split his path will become a 10 year path and I'm not convinced he has the drive or willingness to do all of the visa stuff for himself - I've done everything thus far. I met him while living in Czech, and (I only found out much much later) he actually arrived, kind of applied for a visa there but didn't do it properly and just blamed the system for being stupid and actually just overstayed...

2. We have a 2.5 year old and pets (it's hard to find a place that takes pets that's not super expensive visa vie renting) 

3. I work but he is unemployed (and technically looking for work but he mostly just plays video games and is depressed). He wants to get a job but really seems like he thinks he can just start high up in a company doing politics stuff remotely in the USA, when he got his degree like 15 years ago and he's never actually worked in the field... after uni it was the aftermath of the financial crash and he just took whatever and working in IT for years but hated it. He will get upset if I try to suggest maybe he get something more low key in the meantime, or go to school again or find a company/org he likes and just try and get in whenever and work up. 

4. He's the ""stay at home dad"" but it's actually more like he's a babysitter that doesn't love his job. He's easily frustrated, easily overwhelmed, doesn't take our kid to do very much during the week, the house is always a TIP and I'm still 90% doing everything. If I try and speak about it with him he just gets defensive and exits the room. 

5. He doesn't like me as a person, how I speak, what I speak about and doesn't give a f about anything I care about and I'm just done being treated like shit. I have come to nearly every sports game he's played since we met, I ask about what he's interested in, I listen, I meet his friends, I tried. He's never does any of those things for me and in hind sight all of our initial conversations were so good because I WAS CARRYING THEM, asking questions, offering information about myself etc, not that he was putting in the effort. 

6. We both have ADHD but that's 10000% his excuse for EVERYTHING. He's also really depressed and miserable and speaks about being a prisoner here and I ask what I can do to help with all that and (I still mean it) but everything is actually all my fault anyways. 

7. I got our kid into nursery weekdays 8am-1pm 5 days a week to give him space to himself/find a job/relax but nothing had changed. 

8. Obviously as we're in my home country I have friends and family here and he doesn't, so he has no where to go and idk what to do about it. We can't afford a second rent on what I bring in but I can't keep living like this... 

9. I've been trying really hard to set him up before actually pulling the plug on this - I got him to the doctors and now he's on anti depressants, I worked my ass of to get out kid I to nursery so he would have time and space, I work my ass off so we have money and can live...

10. He has no concept of money and spends like were fine. I've tried asking him to budget so I can give him x amount of money for like the month and don't have to nit pick about it but he won't. I've asked him to write down all he buys for a month do he can see it layed out. I've asked him to stop buying ready meals everyday and letting the rot in the fridge 50% of the time. When I cook I cook for the whole family and with lots of leftovers for the week but he won't eat a meal for more than 2 days in a row but also won't cook so just eats and buys junk. If I give him cash and he runs out he just uses the card anyways so I am always shocked when I look at the account but I don't want to take it away and him to feel trapped/cause a fight. But like dude, we live so close to the library, why can't you go there, bring a thermos instead of going to a cafe and buying like 4 ¬£5 coffees? 

11. Any conversation about anything to do with ""can we try doing this differently?"" Is just a fight and he just doesn't want to have the conversation so will just punch  something or break something to get out of it and then blame me for cornering him. I walk on eggshells all day every day and he's constantly tone policing me and I'm never allowed to feel frustrated about anything even if it's nothing to do with him. 



I'm just so stuck. It's time. But I don't want him to get kicked out of the country, he's still the parent of my kid, and I don't want him to have no where to go but I'm not his mum and I can't keep acting like it and I'm miserable :(

How to cut ties from my very needy, controlling 28M childhood friend?","I have this problem with a childhood friend. I've known him since preschool, we spent a lot of time together, visited each other as kids, and were classmates in elementary school. We also hung out as teenagers and spent a lot of time together. Despite him being my best friend, nothing ever happened between us, except for one time when we kissed, he then wanted to see and touch my boobs. I didn‚Äôt mind because we had known each other forever. This happened when we were still teenagers.

The problem is that he started controlling me more and more. I‚Äôd be doing my own thing at home, and he‚Äôd suddenly call saying he wanted to go out, but he was already standing at my door, emotionally pressuring me into going out. Even when I agreed to go out for a short while, just for a few minutes, he always found excuses to keep me out for a long time. If I agreed to have just one beer, it always turned into more‚ÄîI'd tell him I needed to leave, but he‚Äôd order another one at the bar. Or he‚Äôd suggest going for a walk and sitting on a bench, but I already knew he‚Äôd want to go here and there and wouldn‚Äôt take ‚Äòno‚Äô for an answer. He also couldn‚Äôt stand it when I had a different opinion on something. When we talked, he would always stand extremely close to me, which made me uncomfortable. I told him this many times, but he kept doing it. He constantly demanded my attention and wanted to be around me all the time.

I had enough, so I started acting colder towards him. That‚Äôs when he became even more relentless. I didn‚Äôt know what to do, so I started avoiding him, not replying to his messages‚ÄîI basically ghosted him because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. But we lived close to each other, so he kept running into me. Then he left for a long time abroad, and I finally had some peace. I didn‚Äôt reply to his messages, I started ignoring his calls, etc. Years passed. When he returned, he sent me a message saying that his mother was dying. But I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to reply because I was already mentally drained from him. Then he happened to see me outside and confronted me, saying he just wanted to talk in difficult times and couldn‚Äôt understand why I had stopped writing to him. So I explained it to him. I felt bad afterward, and shortly after, his mother passed away, leaving him completely alone.

But then he started being pushy again, and I really didn‚Äôt know what else to do except ghost him again. Years passed without contact. He sent me a very long message about his current life, which I ignored. In the meantime, I started feeling guilty about how I had treated him.

A few days ago, I randomly ran into him again. He immediately reached out to me, asked me to grab a coffee, and even though I had no time at all, I went with him. It was actually kind of nice, and I was happy that maybe this could have a happy ending. I arranged another meeting with him, but after that, he wanted another one right away, then another the next day. He started calling me again, texting, followed me on Instagram (he pressured me , and sending me pictures from his trips‚Äîhim sunbathing at the beach, working out at the gym, showing off his muscles. He started writing about how he talks about me to all his friends. Whenever we were together, he was just as annoying as before, standing extremely close to me, trying to touch me. I‚Äôve had enough of him and don‚Äôt know how to get rid of him. Ghosting again?

1j770pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1j770pa/more_weirdness_with_covert_narc_and_his_sister/,More weirdness with covert narc and his sister,"Covert narc and I are separated, but it helps me to write things out to process them. CN's (M/52) dad recently passed after a long decline and illness. During that time, CN used his dad's illness as an excuse to hang out with his sister (49/F) CONSTANTLY. And we're not talking about normal planning things you do with a sibling when your parents are in ill health. CN would visit his dad for an hour and then go out for dinner and then coffee with his sister for eight hours straight, until 2 a.m., every single weekend for over six months. They hung out a ton before that as well, but it was particularly intense during this time period and continues to be.

On the surface, I am sure it looks like he's just being a good brother or is devoted to his family. I can see how it would look that way, but that's not the case. Now that the dad has passed, CN and his sister have both said they feel great, their mental health is excellent, and they feel nothing but relief. They have both been smiling and happy for weeks now. I get that people grieve differently, but please believe me when I say these two are having a great time.

In fact, this past weekend, CN took Friday off to be his sister's ride to a medical appointment. He then spent all of Friday and Saturday there: two nights at her house. They were in each other's faces the whole time: expensive meals out, multi-hour-long caf√© visits, home repairs, shopping, talking late into the night, and then the same thing the following day. Super intense, no time apart, for two days solid.

Here's the weird part. CN is like that with NO ONE else, and certainly not me. CN is currently living at his mom's. He's using her for free housing so he can avoid me and mess around with his sister whenever he's not working. The mom complained that she never sees CN, and he hardly talks to her. I mean, the poor woman is a widow. He has not given her five seconds of his time since the dad's death, without his sister at his side, to do anything with the mom. Not a meal out. Not a TV show together. He basically runs away and hides from her when he's not at work.

I realized something. This is exactly what CN has done with me for as long as I can remember. He avoids home, works all the time, and is ""busy."" But somehow, he has all the time in the world for really long, intense weekends with his sister. CN dislikes me and his mom, but he can be in his sister's face constantly, can take time off from precious work, and spend money on expensive meals out that he would not have with anyone else, etc.

It's not about having a good relationship with his sister. I have zero problem with that. I have a good relationship with my sister. It's the weirdly intense, spouse-like relationship he has with her, prioritizing her and time with her over everyone else. 

Even from the start, 20 years ago, it was weird, and I ignored the major red flags. On the day we were moving in together, the sister helped. CN and the sister were whispering in the corner together about how to best move everything. I felt uncomfortable. He was supposed to be my future husband, and this was our house. Yet, he and his sister had to do all the planning while I stood there like an idiot.

The sister has never had a long-term relationship and has never dated. She is conveniently always available because she doesn't really do friendships, either, outside of work. 

I feel like the whole situation is beyond creepy and weird. Some on Reddit have said that CN and his sister ""just get on well."" I'm sorry, but I have never, ever known siblings of this age‚Äîone of whom is/was married‚Äîto spend this much time together, excluding the spouse, way above and beyond how much time they spend with ANYONE else.",1,1741524831.0,NarcissisticSpouses,0,1.0,False

So, I (23M) have these three friends‚ÄîAbdullah, Azeem, and Saad‚Äîwho are way too comfortable constantly flexing about their experiences with girls. 

Azeem even has a girlfriend, and all of them have a solid female friend circle. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm an introvert with maybe one female friend (Sara), and even with her, we barely talk.

So every time the four of us hang out, it‚Äôs just them non-stop yapping about their female friends, their ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù experiences, and even their sex lives. And not gonna lie, it makes me feel kinda awkward and insecure because, well‚Ä¶ I have zero to add to the conversation. 

The truth is, I do have sexual experiences‚Äîbut only with female escorts‚Äîso it‚Äôs not exactly the kind of thing I can casually bring up when they‚Äôre out here talking about dates, relationships, and deep emotional connections.

So, it just got to a point where I was tired of being the odd one out, so I did something incredibly dumb‚ÄîI made up a whole girlfriend.

Yep. I told them I was dating this girl named Safa (who doesn‚Äôt exist), and that we‚Äôre in a happy, committed relationship. 

And I have even threw in details like ‚ÄúOh, I was just on a call with Safa‚Äù or ‚ÄúMe and Safa are going out for a coffee‚Äù just to make it more believable. Hell, I even lied about having sex with her just to match their energy.

But now? This has gotten super exhausting as keeping up with this fake relationship has started to feel like a full-time job. 

The worst part is, they totally believe it, and now I feel stuck and for instance if I suddenly say that I‚Äôve broke up with Safa, I know that they‚Äôre gonna grill me about it and if I just keep this up, I might actually lose my mind.

1j76s23,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1j76s23/my_job_made_me_hate_children/,My job made me hate children,"I (M21) never liked kids. I didn't hate them at first, but I always found them annoying. I especially didn't like my young cousins because they always entered my room whenever they came to visit us, and they almost broke my PlayStation one time. So yeah, long story short, I never found kids cute, and I wanted to stay away from them as much as I could. But I didn't hate them, YET. Despite all that, I decided to get a job at a children's playground. It was a small playground, so I thought it would be an easy job. I needed money, and instead of working at a fast food chain, I thought it would be easier to work there. I thought I would just get the payment from parents and call it a day. I would be okay with dealing with 5-10 kids a day too. But noo. It was horrific. Weekdays were pretty chill (But it doesn't mean we had it easy) but weekends and holidays... Oh my god. I had to deal with 100+ kids every day. We were short on staff too, so I sometimes had to let kids enter the playground, look after them, and take the payment as well. It was... BAD. Kids were so fucking annoying. They screamed their guts out while playing; they loved to fight each other; they sometimes insulted me, and one of the kids fucking spat on my face once. I wanted to just forgive and forget, ""Ah, they are just some silly kids."" I thought to myself. But then... I started to argue with their stupid ass parents. Not because I wanted to, but because those fuckers turned into completely different people when their children got sad/angry over something. They blamed me for everything. ""Oh, my child fell down from the slide and broke her arm! I'm gonna sue you"" How about you look after a three year old next time instead of drinking coffee outside the playground while you could enter the playground and look after her, you dumbass? ""Oh! My grandchild doesn't want to stay inside! She argued with another kid!"" Go talk to that kid yourself, you stupid boomer.

I'm not kidding. There were times I had to look after 20 kids at once. Then another 20 would come with their stupid ass parents. I had to take their information, then let them enter inside, then shout at them when their time would end, then help them leave the playground... It was horrible. I was working inside a mall, and whenever kids left theaters, they immediately invaded the playground. I fucking hated it. I thought I was working at a playground, but actually it was a kindergarten. I was working alone once, and I was waiting for my coworker. Before she could come, around 100 kids came to the mall for a school trip, and I was literally shaking, praying for them to go away before they entered the playground. The panic attack I had during that moment... I was about to have a heart attack. Thankfully they left before anything happened. But I've heard some of them saying, ""Oh my god, we should go to that playground!"" and I almost lost it. Imagine working alone at a playground and 100 kids come at the same time... I resigned last week, argued with my manager because he didn't want to let me go, and now... I fucking hate kids. Fuck that job. I've worked alone for countless hours, dealt with probably 3000 kids ever since I got that job, and now I am traumatized for life. If you are thinking about working at such a place like that, do not make that mistake. I've worked at a small mall, thinking it would be pretty chill, but I still had to deal with 100+ kids every day. DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE. I FUCKING HATE CHILDREN NOW BECAUSE OF THAT JOB.

I noticed one such summer. At exactly 8 AM, a pretty lady comes there. She orders exactly one plate of idli, no chutney, and a cup of filtered coffee‚Äîsometimes a parcel, sometimes to eat. I don‚Äôt like idli; it tastes dry and spongey to my palette.

Then came the winters. She stopped visiting. 
A few months passed. I kept going there routinely, exactly at 8 AM. But she didn‚Äôt. And one fine spring day, she came. Something had changed; her hair was different. A ring had popped on her finger, and her order had changed. It is now two plates of idli and two cups of coffee. In fact, she orders something new every Sunday.

We live in a city with very hard water, meaning we have to decalcify our kettle 1-2 times a week and there's always scum on tea and coffee. 

We used to buy bottled water for tea but it's not the most environmentally friendly and we go through the bottles quickly and have to go shopping a lot. 

I've read there's no real solution to hard water other than having a filter installed in your water system, which we can't do cause we rent.

So now I thought about getting a brita filter to reduce the amount of limescale, but I've heard lots of negative things about them. 

Does anyone here have any experience with brita in regard to limescale? 
Would you recommend getting one or just accept the endless cycle of decalcifying every 3 days?

1j76ktk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j76ktk,Subko Coffee Bandra - Honest Review,"They say you shouldn't meet your heroes, lest you might be underwhelmed if not disappointed. I've always admired Subko as a great coffee brand, and after watching their founder on the WTF podcast, I decided to take the plunge and experience their coffee firsthand. Now, I don't claim to be a coffee connoisseur, but I can confidently say they serve some of the best-tasting coffee in India. We ordered a cappuccino and an espresso, and we loved both.

I won't comment much on the food since the croissant was great, but the sandwich was below par. However, this review isn't primarily about their coffee or food because if it were, the opening line of this essay would be pointless.

To make the coffee experience interesting, they've decided to conduct a fun treasure hunt to find the cafe (I visited Mary Lodge, Bandra West). The Google Maps location isn't precise, and we literally had to rely on street views and photos to locate the place. The lane is extremely narrow. People willing to spend more than ‚Çπ300 on a cup of coffee probably won't drive a car, so parking shouldn't be a concern, right? But if you do plan to bring your car, it's better to park on the main road and hope it doesn't get stolen, towed, or damaged. You'll then have to walk for 5-10 minutes through a shady neighborhood, which can easily be mistaken for a slum.

You finally reach the place with a sense of relief, only to discover the caf√© feels more like an exhibition or museum rather than a comfortable third place to relax. If you prefer comfy chairs over prison-style seating and beautifully decorated walls over raw and unfinished interiors, then clearly, you have zero taste in architecture or interior design. Basically, you‚Äôre ""too poor"" to appreciate the aesthetics.

This isn't a rage post. In fact, I genuinely loved their coffee. If the location were more accessible or situated near shopping or corporate areas where people could conveniently pick up coffee to go, it would have been much more acceptable. And I'm sure the prices wouldn't have differed significantly. As mentioned in the podcast, Indians don't typically go to caf√©s just for takeaway; they prefer a decent dine-in experience. 

Perhaps I'm missing something about the hype, but I'll stick to ordering at home.

The best I‚Äôve done was the local lgbt bar which I wasn‚Äôt too keen on. Just felt  like any other pub where you don‚Äôt know anyone!

Also, the local trans community group tend to do occasional meet-ups but in the evenings. Which is not particularly my thing. I was hoping for walking round the parks in the daytime and getting coffees‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôve also tried the fetish community and not particularly met anyone there. 

I found the website tvchix. This seems to have potential and loads of local people. However many are part time crossdressers and others describe themselves as TV or T-Girls. 

I‚Äôm just a bit confused, are these people trans in the way I understand it (ie. Not a fetish) or are they generally more feeling like they do it part time. 

What is a T-Girl? Am I a T-Girl? Is that the same as a transgender woman?

Also, there are many admirers and some are into the fetish, and some not. 

I‚Äôm just confused, and want to connect with people. If anyone has views after using this site I‚Äôd love to know how to feel.

I think its better for running a more passive venue like a gym or library. Or a more active business like a tattoo salon or coffee shop. just not retail.

These are my thoughts right now, maybe it'll change once i play more, what do you think?",3,1741523027.0,Sims4,1,1.0,False

Cutting is so hard. Hence why I always gave up. 

Here are some Tips/tricks to manage your inner hippopotamus.

1. Soda water- not all are created equally. I looove Zevia cream soda. It is more satisfying and sweetened with stevia. It carried me over until my next meal or snack.

2. Magnesium powder- I hope you are supplementing with mag by this point. I started buying this & drink it in a full glass with warm water in the evening. It also helps to curb the evening sweet craving and hunger. This is the one I use; https://1stphorm.com/products/magnesium/?a_aid=NicoleRae 

3. Black Coffee or green tea sweetened with stevia. Anything warm in my stomach. And sometimes I just want something when I‚Äôm working at my desk in the am. 

4. Lmnt or Lemon water with a bit of stevia. Again sometimes you just want something a little more satisfying than water. I liked to reward myself with one of these on my second water bottle fill. 

5. Water. I actually hate saying this one because people always told me this and when I‚Äôm hungry it doesn‚Äôt help. BUT the overall effect of being hydrated prevents you from confusing being hungry with actually being thirsty. Aim to get 100 oz in per day, with 2/3 of these oz being within the first 6 hours of your day. Water also aids in digestion and will offset the diuretic effects of caffeine intake in the am.  

6. Gum or sugar free mints. When you‚Äôre chewing gum and keeping your mouth occupied it‚Äôs hard to sneak in bites. This is a good social hack. 

7. Walking: I found when I would get in extra walks at work or home I would eat less because I was occupied. Double win. 


Last but not least, for a true appetite suppressant‚Ä¶..

Ever have those days where you are like, ‚Äúwow I didn‚Äôt eat very much, I wasn‚Äôt very hungry?‚Äù Yeah me neither. 

Every few days during a cut I would take a Sudafed- like the good stuff you get from the pharmacy to artificially create these days. 

It doesn‚Äôt work the same if taken every day. Plus it‚Äôs a stimulant so you don‚Äôt want to be all hyped up all the time, not good for your heart or body to be in a sympathetic state every day. Just kind of a buffer for the days when you‚Äôre tired of being hungry or you have a social even and you want to prevent from overeating.

For a while now, a former coworker and friend has been trying to convince me to move in with him to the next city and work with him (I'm 22 and studying remotely). I was 50/50 on the idea of making the change. A month ago, he found out the dates of his vacation and told me to visit him to check out the house and everything. On top of that, he said he wanted to introduce me to a friend of his to ""convince me"" even more to move and stay. So, he put us in touch.  

We started talking without any pretense of anything more, just getting to know each other, friendship, etc. Two days after we started talking, she added me to her close friends on Instagram and told my friend that her relationship situation was ""weird,"" but she really liked talking to me and found me interesting. I liked her too, but my situation was that I had just gotten out of a two-year toxic relationship five months ago, so my mindset was more about meeting people and socializing rather than anything serious or physical.  

Days went by, and every day we spent at least two hours on video calls. We exchanged phone numbers and talked constantly. Certain behaviors and subtle hints made it clear that we weren‚Äôt just going to be best friends or stuck in mutual friendzone territory. Despite that, she told me that right before we started talking, she had begun getting to know another guy. But he worked far away and was constantly in and out of town, so little by little, she stopped paying attention to him and felt bad about the whole situation. I listened and helped however I could to make sure she was okay, whether that meant they kept seeing each other or not, even though I was definitely interested in her. **Spoiler:** He treated her badly, and they stopped talking. This happened about two weeks ago, maybe a week and a half.  

The day finally came when I headed to my friend‚Äôs place, but I had to stop near her house in the morning because I had some shopping to do. So, we planned to meet up for breakfast. Everything went great‚Äîshe was really pretty, even more than on video calls. After breakfast, we took a walk, and she told me that she found me really handsome, loved talking to me, and all that, but that she was learning to be alone, making progress in that sense, and valued her solitude right now. She said she didn‚Äôt want anything with anyone but still wanted us to keep talking because she appreciated me a lot. A few days before, I had told her on a call that I didn‚Äôt want anything serious with anyone right now because I needed my time, so it all made sense. She said she already knew that, but she felt better telling me in person too.  

The next day, after staying over at my friend‚Äôs house and barely talking to her the day before, she called me in the morning to meet up for coffee later in a group. When my friend and I arrived, she was there with two of her friends. During the conversation, she joked that I owed her a date. Then, one of her friends mentioned that a cute guy was hitting on her, and the other friend responded, ""She already has a better catch,"" and they both immediately looked at me. Later, when I was teasing her just for fun, she said, *""Shut up, or I'll shut you up myself.""* I didn‚Äôt get what was going on, considering what she had told me the day before. I felt kind of lost, but after we all went our separate ways, she went back to texting me just like before.  

Finally, last night, my friend, his girlfriend, and I went out for drinks. I wasn‚Äôt planning to see her because she told me she had exams and that we probably wouldn‚Äôt see each other again before I left. But out of nowhere, I got a message from her saying, *""If you want, I‚Äôll pick you up, and we can have that date you owe me.""*  

During dinner, we talked, joked around, and everything, but the vibe was different‚Äîmore personal, more intimate, let‚Äôs say. She even told me that if she didn‚Äôt have an exam on Monday, we could sleep together, just cuddling, because she loves sleeping next to someone. After dinner, instead of heading straight to my friend‚Äôs house, we sat in her car for a long time, just talking. While she was driving, she held my hand. Before saying goodbye, she mentioned having a second date sometime, told me she loved talking to me because we were on the same wavelength, but that she needed to heal and spend more time focusing on herself. When I got out of the car, she got out too, hugged me, gave me a kiss on the cheek, I gave her one back, and when she got home, we stayed on a call for a while.  

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to stay single because I really enjoy the peace I have right now, but it‚Äôs obvious that I feel something for her that goes beyond just physical attraction. At the same time, she‚Äôs not being very clear, and she‚Äôs confusing me a lot. Also, I don‚Äôt want the idea of moving to be influenced by wanting to see her more instead of genuinely liking the area, the job, and being truly ready to make this change in my life for myself.  

What do you guys think? I‚Äôd love to hear your opinions and/or what you would do in my place.  

Sorry for the long post, it‚Äôs my first personal one, and I didn‚Äôt want to leave anything out.

Odd things.  Every day is different. There are so many different things and elements and bits and I really think it is dementia but I am getting nor support and help because everyone's idea is memory loss.  I am struggling with a diagnosis and help.  There are so many things that are vague and subtle.  She is definitely forgetting how to behave and respond. 

Yesterday was a poor day from her. She took some phone calls when her phone rang and I suspect what happening was showtiming where she tried hard on the phone and when the calls were over - maybe she was tired or burnt out.  I don't know. After that I got an afternoon of silence.  

It's so so so so so so so hard.  I know I am thinking on the lines of dementia and many people will say it's the disease but without a diagnosis it is still so so so so so hard. 

I live in a place where there are very poor housing options and housing is very few and far between. 

I do like it at home and I always liked helping but it's getting so hard now.  

This morning while I was up and just getting ready for the day I discovered one of my medicines gone from my bag. It was there earlier in the week and now it's gone.  One of her behaviours that I found is snooping and taking so much so I had to put a lock on my door. 
This coupled with a silence and hostility when she does talk. So  I just left for the day. 

I am wandering around my local city like a lost soul.  I don't know if I should return home in the evening or just stay gone until I know she's gone to bed.  I feel like getting on a train for a morning and going to where it takes me just for a cup of coffee and kill some hours. Then return home at nighttime in the hope that she's gone to bed.  She's horrible to me. Sometimes she can be ok but she can be horrible to me.  Even though I am so mindful. I also work in care but not elder care but disability care there is a lot of transferrable skills so I am a good person for care but when it's so close to home with my own mother it's so hard. 

I remember a few weeks ago being at my boyfriends house and his mother is nearly 80 and I see signs with her too but they are different. Anyways she was leaning on the control and the channels were changing which had my partner shout at her to stop.  I had to intervent and tell him don't be silly, that's not your mom doing it, that's the doggy which calmed her. There was no need for the outburst from my boyfriend and it was a situation just to slide.  So that is one example of transferrable skills from my work to my home and personal life. 

Yes, so wandering around like a lost soul currently. I don't want to go hike to be disrespected. To be grunted at about an oil bill where the tank is failing and she won't even talk to me properly while she snoops and steals from me. ",2,1741522458.0,dementia,1,1.0,False

Right now I have a large eatx case with 5 3.5in drives varying in capacity from 4Tb to 12Tb. All are mostly full of movies and TV shows that I would like to keep. They are not configured in raid or have backups sorted. They started as just one hard drive and it's grown and grown. They're just exfat formatted and mounted to a debian OS server running a cheap graphics card but reasonably modern CPU (8 core Ryzen 1) with about 16gb of ram. The main job of this server is run Plex and handle the servarr ecosystem which it's been doing fine for the past 8 years or so. I'm a software dev and occasionally I use the server for other side projects too, I would like it to do a lot more.

A couple of weekends ago the first (and oldest) hard drive failed. It was a 4 TB one and it was formatted /mounted as NTFS-3g. I think it was also reused from another PC and as it was the first one I'm not particularly surprised. But it's a bit of a wake up call that what I've got will eventually likely fail and the 4Tb of media loss already kinda hurt, it's a collection that'll take a while to rebuild.

I'm based in the UK and bought a house a couple years ago, it has a room that has been reserved for a home office + spare bed that we've left to last to renovate, I pretty much have free reign to do what I want with that room as long as I still fit a daybed into my plans for guests.

There's lots of things in that plan but as far as a homelab goes, I plan to somehow pull off the following:
 - a hardwood bespoke enclosure, built-in and wall mounted.
 - as close to silent as I can get while retaining airflow
 - fitted with likely around 16U of rack rails
 - a new server case that can fit my existing eatx mobo
 - as many hot swappable 3.5in bays as I can get in there

I want to build a raid array up and then somehow migrate all my data into the raid array, and do this without having to buy too many new drives in one go.

The advice I'm looking for is:
 - parts / cases etc to buy and where to get them (UK)
 - tips on how to make the whole thing as silent as possible
 - how to perform the raid migration 
 - how to get the hot swappable hard drives working

I plan to post updates in the journey as the home office as a whole comes together. Other plans for that room include a large built in desk where a section of it is fitted with standing desk legs and can lift up & out of the rest, a custom daybed that pulls out into an almost-double and a bar/coffee station. Lots of hardwood & books mixed with technology.",1,1741522319.0,homelab,0,1.0,False
