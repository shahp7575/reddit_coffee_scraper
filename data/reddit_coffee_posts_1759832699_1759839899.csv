I'm building a language learning app currently and thinking of expanding it into a general learning app specifically guided for beginner language learners, children and toddlers that teaches through games and short illustrated stories. I've taken it upon myself to solve issues that I noticed our current education system lacks, mainly failing to grab our attention and translating the importance of what we're studying at the moment and how that can be applied to our lives in the future.

The app I'm making is basically a collection of educational games, it will be completely free to download with a 5 game demo that can be played directly through the app, no online access, signing up or subscription to avoid any need for online distractions, no clickable ads so no chance of your young ones accidently buying anything. The app is going to be funded through in app purchases, you'll be able to buy the games for 1$ per game as downloadable content, and the only way you can do that is by entering a parental password you give the first time you turn on the app so that your children won't be able to make purchases without your knowledge. All data will be stored on your device, I will not be collecting or selling any user data.

My idea is to make the app on the same financing model sort of like an arcade vending machine. You're going on holiday and want your kids to have fun, have something to do while learning at the same time instead of doom-scrolling social media? It'll only set you back 5-6$, the price of a coffee.

1o0d5ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1o0d5ix/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting?,"At the beginning of the year I met some new mum friends via the app peanut. There‚Äôs 4 of us in this group including me, all of us having our baby boys in 2024, mine being the youngest born in November. Throughout the year, I‚Äôve attended each of their little ones birthday (besides one, as his mum briefly spoke about doing a picnic but no plans were made). But I did buy him a gift. I‚Äôve shown up and made an effort for all of their kids. 

My little one‚Äôs birthday is next month, I‚Äôve hired out a venue, due to it being in November (otherwise would have done a garden party or somewhere outdoors) and I have a huge family so would be too cramped in the house. I made everyone aware back in April when I booked the venue, so they‚Äôve been informed for a while. I‚Äôve recently asked who is attending due to needing to pay per child for their lunch and all of them have been so flaky with a response. The venue is 30 mins away and 2 of them don‚Äôt drive, so understand it‚Äôs inconvenient. I have offered to give one of them a lift and the others partner does drive (I have also said partners can attend). But still getting flaky responses. If they can‚Äôt make it due to travel then I would understand, but none of them have even said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be able to make it but let‚Äôs catch a lunch or coffee date to celebrate instead.‚Äù And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs annoying me. I have shown up and celebrated each of their children‚Äôs special day in any way I can but now that it‚Äôs my son‚Äôs turn not one of them is making the effort. 

Am I overreacting in this? Or should it be a boundary I set? I kinda expected it from one mum as she also let down another mum the other month for her sons 1st birthday, when we had plans, she agreed to them and then just went awol without letting her know she wasn‚Äôt coming (despite us messaging to say we‚Äôre here waiting for her) and only messaged hours later to apologise. And tbh, I was angry for that mum then. 

I‚Äôm going to wait to see how it plays out, but if they don‚Äôt show up in some sort of way for my child on his birthday am I overreacting if I remove myself from the group? And by showing up I mean, sending a happy birthday message, asking how his days going, what we‚Äôre doing. Like we all generally do via chat on the kids birthdays. And also I don‚Äôt want to sound entitled but even gifts, like I‚Äôm not expecting something expensive, even just a card to just show care as I know it‚Äôs close to Christmas, but am I right to feel let down for my son when they haven‚Äôt shown up in the same way we have?

That morning, Karna had sworn: ‚ÄúBefore the sun sets today, I shall defeat Arjuna!‚Äù Confident and fiery, he climbed onto his Rath, the horses neighing like they were ready for Formula 1. Arjuna wasn‚Äôt far away‚Äîjust across what today would‚Äôve been a couple of junctions. Karna thought, ‚ÄúPiece of cake. I‚Äôll be there in minutes.‚Äù But little did he know, he was about to face the true test of Bangalore. Not celestial weapons, not divine warriors, but something deadlier: ROADS and TRAFFIC JAMS. First came the endless wait at what looked suspiciously like Silk Board. ‚ÄúWhy are we not moving?‚Äù Karna barked. His driver Shalya replied, ‚ÄúMy lord, this is peak hour. Even gods avoid this route.‚Äù Then came the diversions: Metro work, service lanes that ended in cows, and Maps shouting ‚ÄúRecalculating!‚Äù every two minutes. Still, Karna pushed on, sweat dripping, the sun inching west. He could almost see Arjuna in the distance, calmly drinking filter coffee and laughing at memes. Victory was so close! And then‚Ä¶ destiny struck! THUD! The Rath‚Äôs mighty wheel sank deep into a massive pothole. No force could pull it out. The more they pushed, the deeper it stuck. Karna‚Äôs heart sank‚Äîthe curse had caught him. In helpless rage, he shouted to the heavens: ‚ÄúLet no wheel in this land ever move smoothly! Let every traveler taste the pain of being stuck!‚Äù And that‚Äôs how the land came to be called Karn-ataka‚Äîthe place where Karna got ataka (stuck). To this day, when you‚Äôre stranded in Bangalore traffic, remember‚Äî you‚Äôre not late. You‚Äôre just part of Karna‚Äôs curse.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1o0cyij,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1o0cyij/i_had_coffee_with_a_new_colleague_the_next_day_i/,I had coffee with a new colleague. The next day I learned he was the bishop of the local central congregation,"TL;DR: I visited seven local Mormon congregations and saw people who calmly drink coffee and tea, smoke, wear whatever they want on Sunday and dye their hair every color of the rainbow. It seems the playbook really does differ from country to country? 

For starters, I'm not from the States. It's best not to mention the country or city, I suppose. I'll just say that this is Eastern Europe, and TSCC (nice term!) is a completely marginal exotica here. Accordingly, I knew nothing about all this lore just a couple of months ago ‚Äî I'm not an exmo, and I'm not a christian at all. If it weren't for the recent Hugh Grant movie, I probably never would have heard of Joe from Vermont and his little book club. But after the event I mentioned in the title, I suddenly decided to play Mr. Reed too. Perhaps someone will find these notes interesting. In the two months I voluntarily spent in the low orbit of the local cultists, I noticed things that boggle my mind and diverge from what I read on your subreddit.

AND IT CAME TO PASS that this summer a new colleague was transferred to our department, and he was a very nice young good-looking guy with a Hollywood smile, YEA, who was constantly talking about his little children and kept himself apart from the team, FOR BEHOLD, I felt sorry for him. One of the first days, I invited him to join us for coffee. Looking back, I realize his reaction was weird. At first, he politely declined, saying he'd rather work during his break. Then he asked which coffee shop we were going to and said he didn't really like it because they didn't have anything to eat. Closer to the break, he suddenly announced he'd come with us. At the checkout, he said he'd have the same drink as me. Okay. We each had medium cappuccinos with sugar. (Looking back: Satan won). 

Later, I decided to stalk him on Facebook. I scrolled through photos from ten years ago of him on a mission. After that, I opened Wikipedia and delved into the Utah Star Wars lore. Searching the official website to find out what kind of presence the White Shirts Social Club has in my city, I found seven congregations nearby. Clicking on the central one, I saw a familiar surname with a ""bishop"" title.

In order not to resemble the narrative of the moron book too much, I will try to be brief and to the point, for these golden plates are limited. By the way: having mastered the aforementioned fanfic in a few evenings, I must admit that the translator (or whoever translated it into other languages, the holy spirit itself?) did a superb job. Stylistically, the translation is very good and imo superior to the original: it's less linguistically inconsistent and less reminiscent of a clumsy nineteenth-century forgery.

So, I suddenly found myself fascinated by the thought that the thing from that cute A24 movie is operating nearby. My psychologist said later that cults have some sort of radiation. Even when you come to them with complete skepticism, you suddenly start to feel at home, and question things less and less. I now wonder if I would have seriously considered converting if I hadn't been another hopeless gay in the first place. I don't know what exactly drew me in: after all, in none of the parishes did I see anything other than a small group (10 to 30 people), mostly elderly grandmothers, a few teenagers, and two or three families with three or four children. I guess their congregations are much more crowded at your end, on average?

Well, yes, I attended one congregation every Sunday. Three days ago, I went to the most remote one, only to see more or less the same thing everywhere: few people, and everyone... doing whatever they wanted, as if Wikipedia was lying, and they were actually allowed to smoke between meetings (Idgaf and went out myself because I'm a bit addicted and I saw a guy who ""blessed the bread"" earlier smoking by the corner) and stroll for coffee after group gatherings. I'm not sure, however, that I was supposed to see this, like last Sunday when I was waiting for the train in a cafe and suddenly noticed a family from a meeting come in and order coffee and pastries. I've also seen posts about people dying their hair after they leave the cult, but guys, on my very first visit there was a guy with long blue hair sitting in front of me. And I would rather say that many of the people at these meetings in different places looked more like punks who had put on a suit. And these weren't neophytes like me!

Idk, maybe I'm stating the obvious, and there will be people who'll say that TBMs are known for their doublethink and that there's nothing surprising about that, but what if the HQ allows countries where the TSCC presence is still minimal to drop the rules? But do seven wards (and its just my part of the country) count as minimal presence? After all, a coffee-drinking bishop?? 

Thanks to your subreddit, I also know now how sinister this cult operates in America. Thank you everyone for sharing your thoughts here. I admit that if it weren't for this criticism (and there's very little of it in my language for obvious reasons), I might well give TSCC a chance. To everyone trying to recover from indoctrination, I bow low. 

P.S. The only thing that truly haunts me now that I have seven mormon fanfiction books on my shelf (I'll save that for history) are the little children I saw in those wards.

1o0cuxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1o0cuxd/bil_left_us_out_of_gender_reveal/,BIL left us out of gender reveal,"I‚Äôm not really sure how to feel about this, so I‚Äôm looking to see if anyone thinks my original reaction was right of if I overreacted. 

I have two BIL and two SIL the brothers are my husband‚Äôs actual brothers, the women are sisters to each other. So two brother married two sisters. They live in another state about a 2 hour drive from us. They live all within a 10 minutes of each towel, including MIL and another BIL. 

One of the BIL and SIL are expecting, they already have a child, so this would be baby number 2.  They had a small gender reveal for the cousins. The two children from the other BIL/SIL relationship and the one child from the expecting family. They invited MIL and the third BIL. We were not told nor invited. Although we knew about the pregnancy and SIL has asked me for some advice a few times through this pregnancy. 

At the gender reveal they had all three cousins ( not including my children) pop balloons to reveal the baby‚Äôs gender. Youngest BIL took a video and sent it to the family chat. That‚Äôs the way we found out, and I don‚Äôt think anyone would have said anything to us if he hadn‚Äôt sent the video. We of course congratulated the couple. SIL then responds with oh all the adults knew the baby‚Äôs gender we just did the surprise for the kids, meaning the two other cousins and her own child who is getting the sibling. 

I was very upset because I felt my kids were excluded. I feel it wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me so much if they just had the child that was expecting the sibling do the popping of the balloons. I understand we are far and it wasn‚Äôt like a big party just a come have coffee and we‚Äôll tell you the baby‚Äôs gender kind of thing. 

I am not planning on telling my children what happened or the baby‚Äôs gender, and if at some point we see the rest of the family and someone asks I‚Äôm just going to say we never showed them the video nor told them, and how would they know otherwise they weren‚Äôt invited to the gender reveal. 

Both SIL messaged me soon after pregnant SIL responded to our congratulates with ‚Äúwell all the adults already knew the gender, we just kept it a secret from the kids and did this surprise for them‚Äù. We have a private chat, they messaged me about my mom ( she recently had surgery) MIL told them about it at the gender reveal. I feel like they were trying to smooth things over in doing that. 

Am I right to be mad? I just feel like my kids weren‚Äôt considered part of the family enough to be included and we weren‚Äôt even told they were doing this, nor the baby‚Äôs gender. I also genuinely don‚Äôt think they would have told us they did the gender reveal or the baby‚Äôs gender at all if BIL hadn‚Äôt sent that video.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1o0cta1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1o0cta1/looking_for_advice_on_friendships/,Looking for advice on friendships,"Hey reddit community,

I wanna start off by saying I‚Äôve never posted anything this personal before and never on Reddit, but over the past month or so I‚Äôve been watching some of those videos on Smosh where people ask AMTA for something (usually the answer is pretty obvious, but maybe not for the original poster or else they wouldn‚Äôt be writing it like I am now) and the cast discusses it and reads other peoples comments. With the current struggles I‚Äôm going through, I decided to use this as a way to get it all out on paper while remaining anonymous and hopefully get some real advice from the reddit community.

I (30 F) have been living in NYC for the past five years and in that time have had a few corporate and a few service industry jobs and have gotten close with several coworkers turned friends from each one. My two closest friends are (we‚Äôll call them Sam 25 F and Mason 33 M) Sam, who I met two months into moving here in 2020 at the restaurant we both worked at, and Mason who I met at my first corporate role in 2021.

Sam and I became very close, very quickly and although she is five years younger than me, she was incredibly mature and it felt like I was always learning something from her, which I loved, especially after moving to a city where I had no friends or family in the tri-state area. Since we‚Äôve been friends, we‚Äôve spent summers at countless concerts/festivals, traveled overseas, spent almost all of our birthdays together, and have been there for the hard moments. She is without a doubt my person. A few years after meeting, four of her high school friends relocated to NYC and moved walking distance from her apartment and while I noticed a slight change in time spent together I tried to imagine if my college roommate/best friend were to move to NYC and how much grace Sam would give me in trying to prioritize them both. Over the years I did my best to become friends with them (even taking a group trip together) so she could have all of her favorite people together and not have to prioritize.

Six months ago, I left my corporate job to return to the service industry (it was a very unhealthy environment and I needed a mental health break, so I returned to bartending, which as an extroverted people person I‚Äôve always loved and have done on/off since turning 21). Sam was so happy for me as she and most of my friends/family heard nothing but negative things from me about my job from pretty much the beginning. This meant we‚Äôd also get to spend more time together as I wouldn‚Äôt need to be at an office by 9am every weekday/our schedules would be more in sync. Unfortunately this turned out to not be the case and whenever one of us was off, the other would be working.

Around five months ago, Sam began dating someone who has recently moved away (about an hour train ride) and I was excited for her because I had already known him as only a friend of hers over the past couple of years but he had very calm energy and I thought how great that would be for her, apart from the constant train travel, but love will take you anywhere. Over these past five months I have only seen Sam about once or twice a month and while I wish it was every day like 2020, we still text almost daily and she‚Äôs there when I need advice, a laugh, a new good song rec, etc).

To be continued‚Ä¶

Mason and I met in 2021 at the office through another coworker/friend. I was the office manager so I knew majority of the employees who would come in regularly (around 100-150 people). I was constantly surprised when people didn‚Äôt know each other, but it made sense, being on different teams and sitting on different floors of the office, meanwhile I would greet everyone each morning, assist them with different events/happy hours, so I made it a habit to try and connect all of these wonderful people I had gotten to know over the two years I worked there. In the first year, my work and social life revolved around this company and I was thrilled. To this day I am still close with/see regularly about 10 of them. Mason, was never close with the same people as me, but we maintained a relationship separate from the group.

Last summer (2024), he and his on/off again girlfriend broke up and shortly after he became more available to go out. She worked at our company too and while I always thought we were friendly with one another, he mentioned she had said some unkind things about me after my birthday party that they attended together and that was one of the final straws after many other things she had said/done over the years that upset him.

After a month or so, we had already gone to four or five shows together and even planned a day trip to Texas to see another show (because why not?) over the course of a year we became so close, numerous concerts, long walks around the city just talking about life, dreaming about what we were capable of (what we want out of life), really opening up about our struggles, we even went on two more weekend trips together in the winter and spring. This was all platonic, very much a brother/sister relationship, nothing more

Around late May/early June he told me he was seeing someone and it was getting serious quickly. My initial reaction unlike with Sam wasn‚Äôt joy and I couldn‚Äôt understand why, because I only wanted him to be happy. I put on my best poker face and listened and celebrated with him in the moment. Since then we have only seen each other a handful of times and I‚Äôm really struggling with it.

About a month ago Mason and I went to a show. I had got us concert tickets months ago and it was the first time we‚Äôd seen each other in a month or so. It felt good to just be in the same space together, listening to music and making new friends in the crowd - it felt like old times. Later on we were on the roof having a smoke break and he asked me if I‚Äôm doing okay with both him and Sam in relationships, getting far less time with both of them. I replied I just wanted them both to be happy and yes for me it sucks because I had to give up time I didn‚Äôt want to give up, that now belongs to both of their relationships and it‚Äôs selfish of me to feel this way but it‚Äôs just how I feel. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that if they‚Äôre both genuinely happy with these people, I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing.

That same night I went to a second show (yes I spend most of my time at concerts, happily alone or with friends) with Sam, who out of nowhere apologized to me for not making enough effort to spend time together and said she really missed me. I was surprised, but realized asking her advice about Mason, it probably got her thinking about our friendship too, and I told her the same thing I told Mason, I just want her to be happy and that I‚Äôll always be around.

More recently I had a gig (I started djing this year, something I always wanted to learn to do) and I invited both Mason and his gf, but a few days before he said he was drowning in work and wouldn‚Äôt be able to go, then on my way to my gig I got a notification he bought concert tickets (it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm tracking him, that‚Äôs a setting he has turned on so all his friends can see when he buys a ticket, I have the same notifications on too) for that same night. It wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me if he just told me he didn‚Äôt feel like going, but figuring it out that way felt odd. Normally we were very honest with each other. I just spent the next hour on stage feeling terrible, but Sam and her friends came to support so I smiled my way through it.

That following week he texted me out of the blue that he and his gf ended up going out doing something else (I‚Äôm sure he realized I got the tix notification) and that his gf is really supportive of me and my dj journey. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond, because he hasn‚Äôt made the effort for me to spend any time with her or get to know her, so she feels foreign to me. How could she be supportive of me when she doesn‚Äôt know me? I just said no worries and catch you guys at my next show.

I haven‚Äôt told him the reality of how much I miss him and our walks. That spontaneous trip last fall feels like a world away and I understand why it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. I‚Äôve talked to my parents and Sam about it who have all gotten close with Mason (my dad who moved here last year even spends time with him alone to grab coffee once in a while). Both Sam and Mason occasionally spend time with my parents without me, and I‚Äôve heard my dad say they‚Äôre both like bonus children to him. My dad said that this is life and whether it‚Äôs fair or not, I have to respect the new version of our friendship and move on from the rest.

I guess I‚Äôm just here writing this ridiculously long novel in hopes of advice on how to move on. Before you comment, please note I‚Äôm not a relationship girl, I don‚Äôt like going on dates (or the hookup culture), I don‚Äôt see myself getting married and absolutely not having children - I prioritize my friends and family and am not interested in finding love. I dated throughout college both men and women and it just didn‚Äôt do much for me (I‚Äôm not a super sexual person anymore and am fine going on without sex). I love my friends deeply and that‚Äôs where my efforts have always gone, since early high school friendships, it‚Äôs always been a priority to me. I understand this is not the norm and I can‚Äôt expect my friends to do what I would do, I just don‚Äôt wanna feel like this anymore and besides falling head over heels in love myself, I don‚Äôt know what else to do to distract myself from my closest friends moving on.

Are adult friendships really meant to dissolve like this? Am I delusional for believing there‚Äôs a healthy balance of friendship and love?",1,1759838566.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,0.99,False

I‚Äôve always been decent at writing short essays, but research papers? That‚Äôs a whole different monster. Between juggling classes, a part-time job, and pretending I actually understand statistics, I was straight-up stuck. My sociology professor assigned a 10-page research paper on how social media shapes political behavior, and my brain just went blank.

I tried starting it three different times. Each attempt ended with me staring at a blinking cursor and wondering if dropping out and starting a food truck business was a better life plan. Then a friend from my psych class mentioned a site he used - said they had great research paper writer support and actually cared about the quality. At first, I brushed it off, but later that night, while scrolling Reddit instead of writing, I saw the same name pop up again - *PapersRoo*. At that point, I figured it was a sign.

I clicked on[ this link](https://essay.watch/SMRTZh?type=28) and found a **10% discount code ‚Äì ESSAY4ME** right at the top of the page. It even had a spot in the order form where I could enter the promo code, so of course I used it. Every dollar saved counts when you‚Äôre a broke student living on ramen and iced coffee.

# What I Ordered & How It Went

I gave them all the assignment details: topic, length, formatting style (APA), number of sources, and my sad excuse for an outline. Within an hour, someone from support messaged me to confirm everything. They even asked a couple of clarifying questions about the focus of my argument, which made me feel like they actually cared about the paper and weren‚Äôt just going to copy-paste something from Wikipedia.

I had about five days until the deadline, so I asked them to finish in four to give myself time to review. The total came to around $85 after the discount - honestly less than I‚Äôve paid for some textbooks I never opened.

Two days later - yes, two days - I got a message saying the draft was ready. I thought it was a mistake, but nope, it was a full, well-structured paper.

# The Final Paper & What Shocked Me

The quality was way beyond what I expected. The arguments were clear, the flow made sense, and the sources were all legitimate academic journals I could actually find online. The citations were formatted correctly, the introduction set up the topic perfectly, and the conclusion tied everything together without sounding rushed.

I even ran it through Turnitin because trust issues, and it came back clean. That‚Äôs when I knew I‚Äôd made the right call. And get this - the papersroo writing service writer even left a few notes in the margins explaining why they structured certain sections the way they did. That helped me sound confident when my professor asked follow-up questions.

# Why I‚Äôd Actually Recommend This

Here‚Äôs the thing: if you‚Äôre going to pay someone to write my research paper, you want it done right. This wasn‚Äôt just some random essay mill. It felt more like working with a tutor who understood the topic better than I did. The price was fair, they finished early, and the communication was on point.

The experience also changed how I see writing services. I used to think they were all scams or shortcuts, but the truth is - if you pick the right one, it‚Äôs just smart time management. You‚Äôre still involved in the process; you‚Äôre just getting expert help to shape your work into something your professor actually wants to read.

# My Advice for Anyone Struggling

If you‚Äôre stuck on a project or just tired of staring at a blank page, don‚Äôt wait until the night before it‚Äôs due. Find a legit service like PapersRoo and let them help you. And for the love of all things holy, use the discount code. That little 10% makes a difference.

Also, make sure to communicate with the research paper writer ‚Äî the more details you give, the better the final product will be. It‚Äôs not just about handing off the work; it‚Äôs about collaborating to make it as strong as possible.

# TL;DR (For the Procrastinators Reading This at 2 AM)

* Stuck on a brutal sociology research paper  
* Heard about PapersRoo from a friend + Reddit thread  
* Used promo code **ESSAY4ME** for 10% off  
* Paid \~$85, got the draft 2 days early  
* Clean Turnitin report, proper citations, academic tone  
* Writer explained structure choices, which helped a ton  

If you‚Äôve ever stared at a blank doc wondering how you‚Äôll finish a big project, this is your sign. Using a solid research paper writing service isn‚Äôt cheating ‚Äî it‚Äôs getting the support you need to actually succeed. College is hard enough. If there‚Äôs a way to make it a little easier, why not take it?

I think the grinder/particle distribution is limiting the potential for some clarity and better cups and I am thinking about upgrading (already, only started brewing middle of August).

Will only be doing v60 for the foreseeable future so not too concerned with needing to grind for espresso.

Looking at the fellow ode gen 2 or the kingrinder k6.
Trying to balance cost vs ease of use and the fact I could take the k6 to work with me, any thoughts on getting either of these or any other recommendations? If ode would mean I am stuck with the hario for work too.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

VIRAL AS IN MAKAKARATING SA TIKTOK AT MABABASA NG WORKPLACE BULLIES NG MOMMY KO,"my mom, F50, she just turned 50 this 2025, she just got back sa water district (secret kung anong branch) and was assigned sa trabaho na interconnected sa job ng katabi niya, so basically they work as a team. 
my mom, being a single mom, she handles all the things by herself, even via phone. basically every problem, every dilemma, every conversation na sinasabi ng mom ko sa amin, naririnig ng katabi niya.
noong pumasok si mommy sa water district yung kaworkmate niya na to F23(if i am not mistaken) sobrang dami niyang backlogs, to the point na tinulungan na siya ng mommy ko para makaahon siya sa backlogs niya, ang nakakainis pa is aware naman siya na marami siyang work backlogs pero papetics petics siya, let‚Äôs put it this way, papasok ng 8AM, magkakape ng 9AM and hindi lang siya basta magtitimpla ng kape tapos back to work, along with her work friends, nagkkape sila doon sa pantry consuming about a half/an hour. eh napakarami niyang backlogs, sayang din yung isang oras na yun, there goes lunch time, mga 11:45 pa lang ready na siyang umalis at lalayad with her friends ng eksaktong 12 at babalik ng mahigit 1PM na, at hindi pa tapos yon, at around 3:30PM magmemeryenda pa sila ng mga kaibigan niya, meryenda as in lalabas pa sila lalakad sa malayo at bibili ng mamemeryenda nila kumbaga sa meryenda palang nila inaabot na ng isang oras, tapos kapag uwian saktong 5PM lalabas na at AWARE SIYA NA MARAMI SIYANG BACKLOGS!!! sabi ni mommy sa tagal na niya sa water district, willing siya na tulungan yung katrabaho niya ang kaso lang, nakakawalang ganang tulungan yung mga taong walang sense of urgency at responsibility.
Pero paano ko nga ba nasabi na binubully nila ang mommy ko?
Tatlo sila sa madalas na magkakasama 2F 1M, panagalanan natin silang ROOSTER, KUTING AT CALAMANSI.

dahil madalas ngang naririnig ni kuting yung usapan o mga sinasabi ni mom over the phone, hindi maiwasan na pagchismisan nila yun, at wala akong problema ron kasi hindi naman nila intensyon pakinggan, sadyang naririnig lang nila. 

Now this is a harmless and playful prank na pinull nila sa mom ko.
One morning, my mom decided to make a cup of coffee pero hindi pa mainit yung tubig sa kettle nila so she decided na iwan muna yung mug niya at magbayad ng water bill sa harap ng office nila. So iniwan niya yung cup and spoon niya sa gilid lang ng kettle, masinop, malinis at hindi nakakasagabal sa gagamit.
naabutan niya sa rooster, kuting at calamansi, na nagkakape sa pantry habang nagchichismisan, she decided na ayaw na niyang makisiksik doon kaya ipinagpamamaya nalang niya yung kape niya at umupo sa desk niya. Bumalik na si kuting kaya lumabas na si mom ko. Pagbalik niya sa pantry, nawawala yung mug niya hinanap niya sa lahat ng cabinet, wala, sa lababo, wala, tinanong pa niya si kuting kung napansin niya kasi sila yung huling nandoon, hindi raw. Nahilo na kakahanap yung mom ko, alam niyo kung saan niya nakita, sa loob ng microwave.
It is harmless, yes, pero sinong gago ang maglalagay ng mug sa loob bg microwave kung gusto lang nilang itabi? or kung akala nila madumi, bakit hindi sa lababo nilagay? SA LOOB PA NG MICROWAVE!!!

hindi nagkakalayo ang mga edad namin, i sm F18 and sila nasa 23-24 pa lang, they are so fucking annoying, hindi alam ang professionalism at maturity sa workplace.

walang masamang nangyari sa mom ko by their playful pranks, pero respeto nalang din na yung mother ko super tagal na sa industry at 50yo na at sila naman they are joking around like high schoolers, grumaduate siguro tong mga siraulong to sa online class. can‚Äôt even finish your fucking backlogs.

I‚Äôd like it to be humorous so if you have any funny stories about awful things they‚Äôve done, lay it on me.  Of course all privacy will be protected, but sometimes truth is just funnier than fiction. 

I‚Äôll start. My mother-in-law was a typical Balkan woman. While she was born in the US, she came from a family that had close ties back to her home country. 

Now, when she came to visit, I did everything for her. Even during holidays at my mother‚Äôs house, she never picked up a dish, contributed to the meal, helped set the table-in fact, I remember having an arm full of my mother‚Äôs best china to set the table, and she would not cut into an appetizer herself. She wanted me to serve her, as I precariously balanced the precious porcelain, even though she was sitting at the coffee table with the appetizer in front of her, complete with little plates, forks, knives, and napkins. She would not deign to cut anything for herself, but must be served. She was totally unaware or didn‚Äôt care that I was about to drop $2000 worth of china because she couldn‚Äôt pick up a little knife to cut herself a slice of artichoke pie. That was her all over.

This attitude pervaded every holiday, every time she came to my house, and even one time when we took her on vacation to the seaside. 

There was one exception, however, on said vacation, when my parents had visitors. All the visitors were men around her age, a few from our home town. All of a sudden she got up and made a huge pretense of serving the men and bringing them food and fluttering around them.  We had never seen her do this before for anyone, but now we knew the secret - you had to be male!  How we laughed! It was so performative, and very revealing of who she really was.

Now that‚Äôs pretty mild compared to what most of you are dealing with. She did do some strange things like dressing like a hooker at a family funeral, and reminding me while I was in the intensive care unit that her birthday was that week when we were also dealing with a very sick infant, but that‚Äôs for another day.

1o0cmqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnexpectedPoetry/comments/1o0cmqx/is_there_any_ultimate_purpose_for_entire_human/,is there any ultimate purpose for entire human civilization ? yes here that is - Navah,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1o0cm0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1o0cm0i/happy_birthday/,Happy birthday,"Gosh, such a long time‚Ä¶ Why the hell do I still remember when you clearly forgot me already?

I feel utterly stupid for that.

To top it up, woke up this morning with you somehow in my mind. Feeling you somehow around, although I couldn‚Äôt remember if I had dreamed about you. I don't believe so, so off with my day.

I‚Äôm spending the day busy with chores and feeling sad. A sinking feeling of missing the great moments I have spent overseas, meeting so many nice people and places‚Ä¶ Meeting you.

I chalked it up to currently being in a place where I don't want to be at all, around people I don't want to be with at all. This is not my home, but where's home anyway? So far I couldn't find it and I'm on my own. And quite lonely.

Then, a few minutes ago, it hit me: today is your birthday. How the hell can I even remember this when you simply told me you had moved on and didn‚Äôt want any contact with me anymore? Why do I still think about you, somehow wishing I could go back in time, to that moment when we crossed paths for such a brief moment? To that evening when I entered that bar, saw you in a corner and thought to myself: ‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶ This guy is so my type‚Äù.

Seven years ago‚Ä¶ How time flies, man. 

I just feel sorry for not captivating you and wouldn‚Äôt have minded us simply as friends. I really meant that the very few times I said it to you: I‚Äôd rather have you in my life as a friend than just a fading memory from years back.

It would have been good to have you as a friend: to share with you my thoughts and days nonchalantly and having you doing the same with me. But you chose not to, so there was nothing more I could do rather than just fade away and ‚Äúmove on‚Äù with my life.

Seven years ago‚Ä¶ I wish things could have taken a different turn and you just said yes to us. 

Yes to that movie the next day we met.

Yes to the coffees, brunches, lunches and dinners.

Yes to the laughs, jokes, friends and parties.

Yes to meeting overseas.

 I would have been a true friend and that‚Äôs it: nothing more, nothing less.

W., I wish you are happy, well, safe and I sincerely wish you a beautiful and blessed life. May all your dreams and wishes come true. Always.

I hope you‚Äôre happy and that you‚Äôve found real love. Especially that you‚Äôve found self-love.

Happy Birthday!

With love always,

It is **Day 8** now and what a whirlwind the past 24-48 hours have been. Yesterday (**Monday, day 7**) I woke up in excruciating pain. The entire weekend was *shit* \- I was fluctuating between having energy and wanting to crawl under a rock for the rest of my life. Going to sleep was easy but STAYING asleep was a whole 'nother ball game. I would wake up 5-6 times in the night with pain so intense I wanted to claw my eyes out. Obviously my throat is dry from 1) mouth breathing because my uvula and throat is too swollen to breath through my nose even at a 45 degree angle and 2) the South African climate being dry. 

Sunday (day 6) we went to lunch with a friend and it was TOUGH. Focusing, trying to speak, trying to eat. I tried to have a glass of wine because I thought 'well, these pain meds are not helping me - maybe wine will!' (It did not). Every sip, bite, and word spoken stung and rang through my jaw all the way to my ears and eventually my soul lol. Yes dramatic, but holy fuck. It hurt. 

Monday, I wanted to end it. (I wouldn't, I love my life but these thoughts started to arise). I woke up in such pain I did not know what to do. My jaw was tight, I was getting hot flashes then cold chills, my body was shaking, my vision was starting to get impaired, my head was POUNDING. At first I thought it was because I drank a glass of wine but no way - I have been super hydrated this entire process and one glass of wine? Anyways. So at 5:00am I took an oxy and sat up in bed (because laying down was too much pressure on my neck from the amount of swelling). I had my partner drop me off at the gym so I could go to the steam room. Maybe this would help as it had the previous few days. I did 2x 10 minutes with a break in between and hydrating during. I went in for my third and final time in the steam room and lasted 2 minutes. I felt like I was going to pass out. Again, normal - maybe this was too much for me right now given the situation. I took a cold shower which 100% of the time brings me back to normal. This time, it did not. I still felt like I was on the verge of fainting. I got dressed and called an uber to go home. It's 7:00am now. 

I took more pain relievers (ibuprofen/paracetamol/codeine mix - OTC pain relief here in SA) and tried making breakfast in which I partially fainted for a few seconds. I recovered, got my shit together then tried to work. I partially fainted again. By 8:30am I couldn't take it anymore. I texted my doctor (no I didn't call because I could barely open my mouth at this point) and she immediately told me this was a Surgical Site Infection. I was upset at this because I had done everything right; kept it clean, brushed my teeth morning and night even when I could barely open my jaw, gargled that magic mouthwash concoction, drank water, etc. Unfortunately though, it can happen no matter how careful you are. She listed all of my symptoms before I could even tell her what they were (my original text was that I was in excruciating pain and I cannot stand it anymore). She told me I could come in to her office immediately if I wanted to but it wasn't necessary because she has already sent a prescription my way and recommended I pick it up and start it at once. I was prescribed antibiotics tot take 2x/day for 7 days, more pain killers (the OTC ones) to take 2-3x every few hours as needed, the suppository anti-inflammatory pain relievers to take 2x per day and more magical mouth wash for numbing. I didn't go to her office - she spent enough time studying medicine to know her shit so who am I to question her lol. 

I ubered straight to the hospital pharmacy, and picked up my meds. I could not find an uber home since I live 900m away from the hospital (guess the short trip wasn't worth it ??) so I had to walk. I'm an athletic woman, I play a sport as a profession, this is nothing. But in THIS condition? I felt like I was trekking Mount Everest... and the walk home was completely downhill haha. When I got home, once I entered the door I fainted for the third time. \*\*\*Faint is a difficult word to use because I didn't lose consciousness - I just blacked out and couldn't support myself physically at all. I lost all vision and fell over/couldn't move however I was still coherent .. but not lol. 

I took the antibiotics around noon and by 8:00pm I was already on the mend. The swelling was decreasing and the pain was subsiding (partially). Today - Day 8 - I feel like an entirely new human. I'm still in a lot of pain, I still woke up during the night in agony but only once! Not 5-6 times as before. I have not taken an oxy today, only the suppository this morning. My voice is a million times better. I can still only speak a little bit before it starts to get too painful, and there is still the feeling of an object or mucus or something clogging the upper back of my throat, but compared to YESTERDAY?! I'll take it. 

And most importantly - I FINALLY POOPED!!! I have been constipated for 5 days now with only a few pebbles here and there. No matter how much coffee I sipped, no matter how much water I in took, NOTHING was exiting me. Could I have taken a laxative? Yes. Should I have? Yes. Did I? No. I am SO much lighter today! 

I have a good feeling it's only upwards from here. I am still in a lot of pain but not the type of pain where I would need an oxy for. I will absolutely take one later for comfort but just noting that technically it's not needed right now. 

If you're still reading, thanks for coming along this journey with me. I'll let you all know how tomorrow goes! I wish I could post the photos of my throat because I took one every single day since the surgery - it's really interesting to see the progression. ",1,1759837873.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

I ended up finishing 44 books across fiction, non-fiction, and self-improvement genres.

Here's everything that worked, everything that failed, and the surprising lessons I learned about reading in 2024.

What DIDN'T work:

Speed reading techniques are BS. All those speed reading methods online are mostly garbage. I spent weeks trying different techniques and apps (tried several on both iOS and Android), but faster reading meant worse comprehension. Sometimes slower is actually faster.

Reading only self-improvement books. I burned out hard trying to read only ""productive"" books. By month 6,¬†**I was forcing myself through business and self-improvement titles that felt like homework. Variety is crucial for sustained reading.**

Digital-only reading. I'm a tech person, so I started with just Kindle and reading apps on my phone. While convenient, I found myself getting distracted by notifications and other apps. Physical books kept me focused longer.

What ACTUALLY worked:

The 25% rule. If I wasn't engaged after 25% of any book, I'd quit and move on. This single rule increased my completion rate dramatically. Life's too short for boring books.

Mixed format approach

* Physical books for deep focus sessions
* Audiobooks for commutes and walks
* E-books (iOS Kindle app) for travel
* Summary apps only for books I'd already read to review key points

Genre rotation system. I alternated between fiction, non-fiction, biography, and self-improvement books. This kept reading fresh and prevented burnout from any single category.

Note-taking apps integration. I used Obsidian (available on both Android and iOS) to create connected notes between books. Linking ideas across different books created deeper understanding than reading in isolation.

Morning reading ritual. 30-45 minutes every morning with coffee before checking any apps or social media. This became a sacred time that I protected fiercely.

Podcasts as book replacements. I love podcasts and using them as content was pretty good. I especially liked it when people talked about their experience on how they applied the book.

Podcast supplementation (the right way). Instead of replacing books with podcasts, I found podcasts where authors discussed their books in detail. This reinforced learning without replacing the deep reading experience.

Reading 40+ books taught me that the goal isn't consuming more content it's building a better thinking system. The best self-improvement comes from deeply understanding fewer ideas rather than superficially knowing many. It's better to read 10 good books again and again than to read 100 books without understanding any of its principles.

For anyone starting their reading journey:¬†**Forget the apps promising shortcuts. Get comfortable books in whatever format works for you, quit the boring ones ruthlessly, and focus on understanding over speed.**

I'm happy to share specific strategies that worked for me.",1,1759837823.0,becomedisciplined,0,1.0,False

The first time I got my hands on the iRobot 4632813 Hard Floor Cleaner, I was admittedly curious about how it would fit into my daily cleaning routine. I live in a house with kids, a playful yet mischievous dog, and high-traffic areas that seem to generate dirt like a factory. Naturally, I paired this cleaner with my iRobot Braava mop to see what it could really do. Spoiler: it didn‚Äôt disappoint‚Äîbut there are nuances worth addressing along the way.

**Convenience and Ease of Use**

The cleaning solution arrived in a compact 16-ounce bottle, neatly designed to fit into any cleaning closet without swallowing up precious space. Mixed with water, it instantly added this long-lasting, fresh scent to my mopping sessions. I mean, it‚Äôs weirdly satisfying to come home after work and smell that hint of cleanliness in the air. With clear instructions provided on the packaging, even someone like me, who occasionally ""eyeballs"" measurements, found it foolproof.

**Strengths**

- Compatible with a wide range of iRobot products, including Braava Robot Mops and Roomba Combo models.  
- Provides a noticeable fresh scent that lingers, making it feel like I‚Äôve put in hours of cleaning (even if it‚Äôs just the robot doing the job).  
- Successfully removes sticky residue left by my toddler‚Äôs juice spills.  

[Check iRobot 4632813 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b07rd8356h/)

**Effectiveness on Stubborn Stains**

If I were to gauge its cleaning power solely on how well it tackled my living room‚Äôs coffee stain battleground, this cleaner earns solid points. More often than not, I have spills from my morning coffee that never seem to be just one drop‚Äîit‚Äôs like the entire mug gets tipped over. The solution, when paired with my Braava mop, cleaned it up without needing a second pass. That said, if your floors are caked with older, set-in dirt, you might still want to do some pre-cleaning prep.

**Packaging and Environmental Impact**

The 16-ounce bottle might look small, but don‚Äôt let it fool you‚Äîit goes a long way. I was pleased with how efficient the solution is when diluted. However, I couldn‚Äôt help but think about the environmental impact of plastic bottles. Wouldn‚Äôt a refillable option or biodegradable packaging make more sense here? This is an area where the product could really innovate.

**Drawbacks**

- Could offer more sustainable packaging or a refillable option.  
- Only compatible with specific robot mop and vacuum models, which could limit its use for homes with mixed brands of cleaning tools.  

**Product Rivals**

Compared to its closest competitors, like Bona‚Äôs floor-cleaning solutions or Swiffer‚Äôs wet solutions, this one seems built specifically for tech-savvy individuals already invested in the iRobot ecosystem. While Swiffer might be more versatile with its easy-to-grab mop and wipes, the iRobot cleaning solution shines in its automated approach. Bona comes close in terms of scent and performance but lacks integration with robotic tools, which is where this cleaner pulls ahead.

Still, I'd love for the cleaner to offer a slightly broader range of universal compatibility to compete with multi-purpose brands.

**Affordable Quality**

The cost-efficiency of this cleaning solution largely depends on how much you value customization in cleaning automation. Its primary draw lies in its seamless compatibility with iRobot‚Äôs Braava mops and combo vacuums. Is it budget-friendly compared to generic cleaners you could grab from a grocery store? Probably not. Yet, for someone like me who prioritizes a consistent, maintenance-free cleaning setup, the slight premium seems justified.

1o0c58f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_citygirl19955/comments/1o0c58f/looking_for_advice_on_friendships/,Looking for advice on friendships,"Hey reddit community,

I wanna start off by saying I‚Äôve never posted anything this personal before and never on Reddit, but over the past month or so I‚Äôve been watching some of those videos on Smosh where people ask AMTA for something (usually the answer is pretty obvious, but maybe not for the original poster or else they wouldn‚Äôt be writing it like I am now) and the cast discusses it and reads other peoples comments. With the current struggles I‚Äôm going through, I decided to use this as a way to get it all out on paper while remaining anonymous and hopefully get some real advice from the reddit community. 

I (30 F) have been living in NYC for the past five years and in that time have had a few corporate and a few service industry jobs and have gotten close with several coworkers turned friends from each one. My two closest friends are (we‚Äôll call them Sam 25 F and Mason 33 M) Sam, who I met two months into moving here in 2020 at the restaurant we both worked at, and Mason who I met at my first corporate role in 2021. 

Sam and I became very close, very quickly and although she is five years younger than me, she was incredibly mature and it felt like I was always learning something from her, which I loved, especially after moving to a city where I had no friends or family in the tri-state area. Since we‚Äôve been friends, we‚Äôve spent summers at countless concerts/festivals, traveled overseas, spent almost all of our birthdays together, and have been there for the hard moments. She is without a doubt my person. A few years after meeting, four of her high school friends relocated to NYC and moved walking distance from her apartment and while I noticed a slight change in time spent together I tried to imagine if my college roommate/best friend were to move to NYC and how much grace Sam would give me in trying to prioritize them both. Over the years I did my best to become friends with them (even taking a group trip together) so she could have all of her favorite people together and not have to prioritize. 

Six months ago, I left my corporate job to return to the service industry (it was a very unhealthy environment and I needed a mental health break, so I returned to bartending, which as an extroverted people person I‚Äôve always loved and have done on/off since turning 21). Sam was so happy for me as she and most of my friends/family heard nothing but negative things from me about my job from pretty much the beginning. This meant we‚Äôd also get to spend more time together as I wouldn‚Äôt need to be at an office by 9am every weekday/our schedules would be more in sync. Unfortunately this turned out to not be the case and whenever one of us was off, the other would be working. 

Around five months ago, Sam began dating someone who has recently moved away (about an hour train ride) and I was excited for her because I had already known him as only a friend of hers over the past couple of years but he had very calm energy and I thought how great that would be for her, apart from the constant train travel, but love will take you anywhere. Over these past five months I have only seen Sam about once or twice a month and while I wish it was every day like 2020, we still text almost daily and she‚Äôs there when I need advice, a laugh, a new good song rec, etc). 

To be continued‚Ä¶

Mason and I met in 2021 at the office through another coworker/friend. I was the office manager so I knew majority of the employees who would come in regularly (around 100-150 people). I was constantly surprised when people didn‚Äôt know each other, but it made sense, being on different teams and sitting on different floors of the office, meanwhile I would greet everyone each morning, assist them with different events/happy hours, so I made it a habit to try and connect all of these wonderful people I had gotten to know over the two years I worked there. In the first year, my work and social life revolved around this company and I was thrilled. To this day I am still close with/see regularly about 10 of them. Mason, was never close with the same people as me, but we maintained a relationship separate from the group.

Last summer (2024), he and his on/off again girlfriend broke up and shortly after he became more available to go out. She worked at our company too and while I always thought we were friendly with one another, he mentioned she had said some unkind things about me after my birthday party that they attended together and that was one of the final straws after many other things she had said/done over the years that upset him. 

After a month or so, we had already gone to four or five shows together and even planned a day trip to Texas to see another show (because why not?) over the course of a year we became so close, numerous concerts, long walks around the city just talking about life, dreaming about what we were capable of (what we want out of life), really opening up about our struggles, we even went on two more weekend trips together in the winter and spring. **This was all platonic, very much a brother/sister relationship, nothing more** 

Around late May/early June he told me he was seeing someone and it was getting serious quickly. My initial reaction unlike with Sam wasn‚Äôt joy and I couldn‚Äôt understand why, because I only wanted him to be happy. I put on my best poker face and listened and celebrated with him in the moment. Since then we have only seen each other a handful of times and I‚Äôm really struggling with it. 

About a month ago Mason and I went to a show. I had got us concert tickets months ago and it was the first time we‚Äôd seen each other in a month or so. It felt good to just be in the same space together, listening to music and making new friends in the crowd - it felt like old times. Later on we were on the roof having a smoke break and he asked me if I‚Äôm doing okay with both him and Sam in relationships, getting far less time with both of them. I replied I just wanted them both to be happy and yes for me it sucks because I had to give up time I didn‚Äôt want to give up, that now belongs to both of their relationships and it‚Äôs selfish of me to feel this way but it‚Äôs just how I feel. It doesn‚Äôt change the fact that if they‚Äôre both genuinely happy with these people, I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. 

That same night I went to a second show (yes I spend most of my time at concerts, happily alone or with friends) with Sam, who out of nowhere apologized to me for not making enough effort to spend time together and said she really missed me. I was surprised, but realized asking her advice about Mason, it probably got her thinking about our friendship too, and I told her the same thing I told Mason, I just want her to be happy and that I‚Äôll always be around.

More recently I had a gig (I started djing this year, something I always wanted to learn to do) and I invited both Mason and his gf, but a few days before he said he was drowning in work and wouldn‚Äôt be able to go, then on my way to my gig I got a notification he bought concert tickets (it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm tracking him, that‚Äôs a setting he has turned on so all his friends can see when he buys a ticket, I have the same notifications on too) for that same night. It wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me if he just told me he didn‚Äôt feel like going, but figuring it out that way felt odd. Normally we were very honest with each other. I just spent the next hour on stage feeling terrible, but Sam and her friends came to support so I smiled my way through it. 

That following week he texted me out of the blue that he and his gf ended up going out doing something else (I‚Äôm sure he realized I got the tix notification) and that his gf is really supportive of me and my dj journey. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond, because he hasn‚Äôt made the effort for me to spend any time with her or get to know her, so she feels foreign to me. How could she be supportive of me when she doesn‚Äôt know me? I just said no worries and catch you guys at my next show. 

I haven‚Äôt told him the reality of how much I miss him and our walks. That spontaneous trip last fall feels like a world away and I understand why it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. I‚Äôve talked to my parents and Sam about it who have all gotten close with Mason (my dad who moved here last year even spends time with him alone to grab coffee once in a while). Both Sam and Mason occasionally spend time with my parents without me, and I‚Äôve heard my dad say they‚Äôre both like bonus children to him. My dad said that this is life and whether it‚Äôs fair or not, I have to respect the new version of our friendship and move on from the rest. 

I guess I‚Äôm just here writing this ridiculously long novel in hopes of advice on how to move on. Before you comment, please note I‚Äôm not a relationship girl, I don‚Äôt like going on dates (or the hookup culture), I don‚Äôt see myself getting married and absolutely not having children - I prioritize my friends and family and am not interested in finding love. I dated throughout college both men and women and it just didn‚Äôt do much for me (I‚Äôm not a super sexual person anymore and am fine going on without sex). I love my friends deeply and that‚Äôs where my efforts have always gone, since early high school friendships, it‚Äôs always been a priority to me. I understand this is not the norm and I can‚Äôt expect my friends to do what I would do, I just don‚Äôt wanna feel like this anymore and besides falling head over heels in love myself, I don‚Äôt know what else to do to distract myself. 

Are adult friendships really meant to dissolve like this? Am I delusional for believing there‚Äôs a healthy balance of friendship and love? ",1,1759836607.0,u_citygirl19955,0,0.99,False

Tive:

Rain chewed at the city like a dog with a bone. It never stops raining here. Neon ran in rivers down the glass of the corporate tower I was about to walk into, and the higher I looked the less the lights meant anything. Up there, behind the blue logos and smoked glass, they still pretended experiments had names that weren‚Äôt crimes.

My coat was black and heavy with the rain. My glasses were fogged at the edges. My revolver, *The Cure*, sat snug in the holster, triple barrels polished dull under the streetlamp.

My target was a secondary wing of Division 9, a corporate fa√ßade for a basement of teeth and white coats. Insider tip: two floors of R&D, one of observation, and a basement where they kept the ‚Äúfast lanes‚Äù for experiments they wanted to forget. I hated how carefully they chose their excuses.

I moved like I always do. slow, patient, invisible in the rain until I wasn‚Äôt. The loading dock smelled of oil and disinfectant. Two security techs with night visors and corporate insignia were arguing about coffee. By the time they heard me, it was already too late. Their death warrant was signed, and blindness was the pen

I didn‚Äôt hesitate. The first barrel cracked like a judge‚Äôs mallet. The man folded, the visor‚Äôs glow flickering out of his face. Second barrel for the other man who never had time to draw. The third pulled for the lock on the loading door when the alarm finally cried out, because I knew that sound. knew it would bring cleaners and suits and men in lab coats with name tags that felt like lies.

Inside, the building smelled sterile and wrong, like soap and old blood. Fluorescent lights buzzed. Security drones hummed like small angry flies. My boots hit tile. I moved from shadow to shadow, letting the building do the work of hiding me. Two cameras blinked on the ceiling, I ignored them. The Cure doesn‚Äôt waste a round on glass.

I found the stairs. Elevators were noisy and polite; stairs were patient and honest. Down we went, and with every step the city‚Äôs rain felt farther away, until the only weather left was the hum of freezers and the soft, wet sounds of experiments that didn‚Äôt like being interrupted.

They had a protocol for intruders. I‚Äôd walked through the same choreography before: locked doors, steel doors, doors that said DO NOT ENTER. I entered anyway. The first lab door was ajar, and the smell hit me. metal, antiseptic, the sweetness of something that had been cut open and still sang. A woman in a lab coat leaned over a table with instruments, counting data like prayers. She flinched when I fired the first barrel, because you don‚Äôt expect a man in the dark anymore, you expect cameras. Her head snapped back, red blooming against the lab white. *The Cure* flashed again. The third barrel tuned the hinges when the next technician barged in, gloved hands reaching for radio commands.

Combat is a language of rhythm. *The Cure* speaks in threes. I learned that in a room with too many monitors and the smell of formaldehyde. The first shot stops a man from seeing your face. The second shot removes his ability to make a sound that you can track. The third slams the door on anyone trying to call for help. It‚Äôs tidy, and tidy is how I sleep at night. If you can call it sleep. I never really slept much.

Footsteps multiplied. Lab coats and security boots, a chorus. They came through the corridor like a wave. I moved to a dark corner and waited. When the wave broke on my position, I slid from cover and fired; *The Cure* sang, and bodies hit tiles with wet thuds. Someone screamed and then there was only a wet hush. The bullets chewed through fiber composite and then, for the first time in a while, through something that understood pain.

One of the scientists fell wrong and something under his lab coat writhed. I had seen the signs in the field‚Äîtissue that was not entirely human, grafts that crawled at the edges, little seams that should not have been sewn. The building liked to pretend those were ""contained anomalies."" To hell with their euphemisms.

A door at the end of the hall burst open. Two men in the glossy white coats I used to wear stepped out, faces younger than their horror, eyes clinical and empty. One held a tablet like an amulet. The other laughed, a thin sound that didn‚Äôt belong in a place smothered by the idea of control.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre out of your element, Tive,‚Äù the lab coat said. He thought knowing my name would hurt. Once, maybe it would have. Now it's a reminder.

‚ÄúNot tonight,‚Äù I said. Three quick steps, *The Cure* clearing a path. I didn‚Äôt give them a chance to plan. Revolver barked, steel rang off tile, and the man with the tablet dropped it, the screen shattering like a fist in a face. Blood painted the pristine floor. He reached for something else‚Äîan injector? A remote?‚Äîand my third barrel answered. He never finished the movement.

Another brigade of coats fell in. I moved between them like a shadow with a hammer. Razors of pain and flashes of light‚Äîmy bullets didn‚Äôt always pass through flesh. Sometimes they made it scream, and sometimes, rarely, the armor of their arrogance held and I had to move around and slit throats or snap necks with a careful hand. I don‚Äôt like that part; I never liked it. But I did what had to be done.

In the main observation room I found their prize. A glass tank, and inside it something that fit the word wrong. Pale, folded in on itself, lined with stitching and the wet slick of tissue that knew the rain. A subject, or a half-made thing, jerking under the lights like a sleeper in a bad dream. Monitors glitched with heartbeat signals that sounded like bad static. The tech monitoring it had his hands on the console like a man clinging to a raft. He turned when I stepped over his body.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù he started.

I said nothing. *The Cure* spoke instead. Three barrels, three small explosions, three neat ends.

The subject watched me with those glass eyes, and somehow I saw my own reflection there‚Äîold, small, guilty. Maybe that was the part that hurts the worst. I planted the muzzle against the glass and fired one barrel at the seal. The glass spiderwebbed and held. I fired again, and the glass blossomed into a jagged mouth. With a final blow the tank let go and rain-scented air touched skin that had been suffocating under antiseptic. The subject didn‚Äôt run. It turned and looked at me, and for one impossible second I thought it was pleading.

I am a former scientist. I know the pull of curiosity. I know too that some doors are not meant to be opened by polite hands.

I smashed the mounting, ripped the subject free, and the thing rose. It wasn‚Äôt the monster they sold to the board. It was a stitched fist of someone else‚Äôs life. It smelled like the rain. It moved, and it made a noise like a choir made of broken things.

There was nowhere to go but down. My revolver barked until the tank itself was a ruin of glass and metal. The subject collapsed to the tile and then began to shriek. more sound than body. I knelt and put a boot on its ribs, feeling the weak, wrong thrum beneath. This creature was our mirror, and I smoothed blood from the lab white with the side of my hand like it was laundry I couldn't avoid washing.

The alarms were full wail now, and above them, in my head, the ghost of a voice: *You opened the door.* It had the cadence of a man who did not expect forgiveness.

I left them in a mess that would ruin some careers and save none of the souls they‚Äôd stolen. I left the cameras blinking, the bodies still warm, the monitors polled and useless. I took nothing. I never did. Not anymore.

Outside, rain softened the edges of blood on my gloves and coat. *The Cure* was warm in my hand, spattered with industry. I walked back into the city like a man who had done what he could and knew it might never be enough. Power shifts like water in this town, and I had shoved a small stone into its flow. Maybe it would make a ripple. Maybe it would be ignored. Maybe they‚Äôd come for me with a dozen men in better coats with cleaner hands.

But the rain is good at hiding footprints, and I know which alleys the cutters use. I folded myself into the dark, into the pockets of the city I had chosen to haunt.

When I closed my eyes that night, the faces of the coats floated behind my lids‚Äîtheir hands reaching for levers and scripts and buttons. And I heard it again, the echo that never quite goes silent:

*You opened the door.*

Maybe I did. Maybe I‚Äôll do it again. Maybe the only way to fix what‚Äôs been opened is to keep pushing back until the thing that calls the shots can‚Äôt hide behind a glass and a logo anymore.

I keep my glasses because they still catch glints of truth. I keep the coat because it hides what I leave behind. I keep the gun because sometimes a triple barrel is the only answer a conscience will accept.

Tonight I taught a wing of white coats how fragile their clean rooms were. Tomorrow I‚Äôll teach another. And if the city is still breathing when I‚Äôm done, maybe one name on a list will be enough to start the cleansing.





THE KING OF RED MILE

Raz:

Rain slashed at Red Mile like it had a score to settle. Neon signs bled into puddles, turning the street into a fractured rainbow, but I didn‚Äôt see the colors. I saw the target: a corporate front masquerading as charity, hiding a lab beneath fluorescent perfection. People in white coats thought they were invisible, but I‚Äôve been invisible, and that taught me how to move.

I roll a pill under my tongue; not to get high ‚Äî I‚Äôm already wired from years of booze and pills anyway ‚Äî but to steady the tremor in my hands. *The Encore* waits patiently at my hip. An axe head I stole long ago from fights past, shotgun welded under the blade, the weight humming like a bassline through my arm. She‚Äôs heavy, honest, and beautiful. Noir Rock taught me rhythm; the mercenary life taught me timing. Tonight, both are essential.

a pair of guards lean against the loading bay. I step in time. First swing: the axe head smashes the metal door frame. Sparks fly like pyrotechnics I used to set off on stage. Short, savage bursts from the shotgun under the blade catch the first guard square in the chest. Kevlar screams. He crumples. The second tries to raise his radio. I slam the axe into his wrist, slicing it clean off.

Inside, the lobby reeks of sterility and fear. Lab techs scatter, their white coats waving like flags. One lunges for a panic button. I laugh. The Encore swings high; shotgun fires mid-arc ‚Äî a percussive rhythm of pain. Another tech tries a sidestep. I pivot, axe smashing through forearm, elbow, and pride. Blood and rain mix into the perfect accompaniment.

Flashes hit me mid-swing: sweaty stage lights, screaming fans, my guitar screaming in sync with my voice, Noir Rock lyrics spat in defiance of every corporate suit that told me I was nothing. Every riff, every beat, every crash of The Encore is a measure in a song that never ends. Mercenary life taught me improvisation, and I‚Äôve been composing chaos for years.

The cages come into view, stacked like broken intentions. A subject inside stares at me with wide, glassy eyes. My pulse matches the rhythm of a song I wrote years ago ‚Äî a verse I never finished. Encore swings, shotgun sings, tendon and bone become percussion.

Cleaners arrive: suits in black, masks, guns trained and ready. I grin. Improvisation becomes choreography. Axe arcs, shotgun pops, bodies collapse to the beat. Mercenary instinct keeps me alive; every swing is a note, every blast a crescendo.

I clear the main hall, debris clattering around me. Flashes of Noir Rock: I strum an invisible guitar. Encore obeys like it‚Äôs my instrument, my voice, my fist. One tech lunges with a syringe; axe catches, shotgun pops, he falls like a broken speaker.

By the time I pry the last cage open, wet and laughing like a lunatic, the lab is a ruin. The subjects look at me with wide eyes. I wipe blood from the axe, taste rain and iron. The city outside pulses with neon and fear.

And then I hear it: a voice over the storm.

‚ÄúTook you long enough, Raz.‚Äù

I spin. Glasses glint in the neon rain. A black-coated man stands there, small, composed, precise. No weapon drawn. Not yet. Just watching.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre reckless, loud, and you survive better than most. You‚Äôll fit right in,‚Äù he says. His words are deliberate, like a bassline under a chaotic solo.

‚ÄúFit in where?‚Äù I ask, blood on my jacket, Encore dripping.

‚ÄúRaven Flies,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe clean the city. You‚Ä¶‚Äù he gestures at the Encore, at the carnage, at me. ‚Äú‚Ä¶you make a performance they‚Äôll never forget.‚Äù

I laugh, because he gets it. No tour, no screaming fans. Just weapons, neon, rain, and a city screaming back. He offers a band again, only the instruments bite, and the songs end in screams.

I join him. My first mission with Raven Flies: help clean the aftermath, get the city back under control ‚Äî or at least under our control. Mercenary work taught me obedience, improvisation, and survival. Noir Rock taught me flair. Together, they make me indispensable.

By the time the last cleaners retreat into the night, we‚Äôve rescued the subjects, gutted the corporate defenses, and painted the corridor in blood, neon, and rain. I stand in the alley, Encore on my shoulder, grin wide, and let the city sing my song.

If someone calls me a douche or a killer, I‚Äôll smile. They‚Äôve only noticed the verse I wrote in blood and fire. The city hums around me, and I know this is my stage again. Only now, the audience is evil, the instruments are lethal, and the encore‚Ä¶ Well, the encore never ends. Sure‚Äîlittle things that put men to sleep like faint favors‚Äîbut mainly he had the kind of timing that turns a bad situation into a neat exit.





Born On The Edge

Guts:

Crime was my first lullaby. The city sang it soft and mean while I learned to pick pockets before I learned to tie my shoes. Alleyways taught me to breathe quiet, to count purses by weight, to make myself disappear into the spaces people forgot to watch. By twelve I was running errands for men who paid in favors and broken cigarettes. By sixteen I was muscle‚Äîfast hands, cold grin. Knives found me because they were honest. You point them and the world answers.

I liked the answers.

The jobs escalated. Smash-and-grabs, storage-unit skips, docks emptied with the grace of a practiced thief. I graduated to heists that smelled of corporate linen and cheap vodka. I learned how to move men away from doors, how to read the soft places in a patrol, and how to make a racket that let me take anything I wanted. There‚Äôs a religion to it ‚Äî adrenaline and silence, the flash of something valuable in your hand and the rush of vanishing before anyone remembers the face that took it. I learned to enjoy the noise people make when they realize they‚Äôre empty, how the world rearranges itself after you remove a piece.

Then the labs crept into our maps‚Äîquiet vans, doors with no logos, men who stopped existing on the ledger. I thought we could scrape profit from the confusion. We were wrong. One botched run and I woke up in a cage. Papers say ‚Äúsentence.‚Äù I call it a sharpening stone.

Prison is the place you find out what you really like. It‚Äôs metal and old coffee and the slow hum of fluorescent lights that hum back everything you‚Äôve tried to forget. I started with counting knives. Then I started cataloguing‚Äîwho signed off on which shipment, the trucks that moved like shadows at dawn, the names that don‚Äôt get printed in polite news. I mended blades and men in the same breath. Fixing the broken felt clean. Cutting felt cleaner.

And I liked cutting. Say it how you want‚ÄîI liked it. The stab of certainty. The satisfied little hush when a man stopped fighting because he realized he could not. It‚Äôs an animal joy, sure, but one that kept me warm in concrete rooms. I kept lists. Lists make the city predictable, and predictability lets you plan the fun parts.

Which is why the folded scrap slid under the dinner slot felt like a present. A time, a place, a name with teeth. I could have screamed and made a commotion, but I am patient. I plan. I sharpened spoons, I hollowed a broom handle, I wove knots into pillowcases. I can make a noisy exit if I want. I prefer the pretty ones.

Then the door clicked.

You get two kinds of surprises in prison: the kind that comes with boots and bad intentions, and the kind that comes with a small man in a wet black coat who looks like he‚Äôs been out in the rain too long. Tive‚Äôs glasses caught the strip light like two tiny moons. He didn‚Äôt run. He didn‚Äôt shout. He didn‚Äôt make a movie of the moment.

He leaned against the wall, looked at me as if he‚Äôd known me a long time, and asked, ‚ÄúYou good with blades?‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù

He moved like someone who had written and rewritten the world in small corrections. Quiet observation, patient timing. He didn‚Äôt blast a hole through the security system. He waited until it forgot its part in the play. He didn‚Äôt force doors open so much as make them choose to be open for us.

I won‚Äôt give you a manual for how he did it. That‚Äôs his business. What I will tell you is how the lights flickered, and one guard blinked and forgot his shift, and the camera showed the same ten seconds on loop like an actor repeating a line. Tive had patience. He had gadgets, in. Tive crawled through like a ghost, then came back to the cell with wire cutters and a smile that didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúMove smoothly,‚Äù he whispered. Simple. Clean. I slid out like oil from a jar, knives hidden under my coat, a grin already pressed in place.

We walked corridors that smelled like shit and piss. A guard rounded the corner, voice raw with boredom, and Tive handed him a card. bribe or maybe threat. The guard glanced at me and kept walking. You don‚Äôt always need a fight when you have patience and little hands that can make men forget why they are awake. We passed another guard who blinked and blinked and then said aloud to himself about a dream he‚Äôd had. Tive‚Äôs work is quiet. It hums under people‚Äôs tongues until they forget to shout.

When we hit the outer wall, he didn‚Äôt shout ‚ÄúRun.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt cheer. He slid a pair of battery shears through the chain like a seamstress cutting thread. A fence fell open and the rain swallowed the sound. The city exhaled us and we stepped into the alley like vultures into applause.

Out in the weather, under neon that made everything look guilty or divine depending on the light, Tive asked the question he‚Äôd been waiting to ask the whole time we moved through the building: ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do with your hands, Guts?‚Äù

I could have lied. Could have said I wanted out, clean living, sunlight. Fuck that. Truth is better when you‚Äôre trying to make deals with men who move knives for a living.

‚ÄúCut what needs cutting,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúFix what can be fixed. Enjoy the rest.‚Äù

He smiled like someone who‚Äôd been handed a tool he knew how to use. He didn‚Äôt offer platitudes. He offered a card‚Äîblack, two words printed in a font like a quiet threat: *Raven Flies.* ‚ÄúWe move when the city leaks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe stitch what we can. We cut what we must.‚Äù

I thought about the cages, the glass eyes in them, the men who‚Äôd been put back together and then tossed aside. I thought about knives cooling under lights. I thought about the happiness I get when a plan comes together and the noise dies. I thought about whether I wanted to spend my life running petty jobs for men who called themselves kings.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I said.

No ceremony. Tive doesn‚Äôt do fireworks. He hands you a door and expects you to walk through. He dropped me at a safehouse with three clean blades, some food that wasn‚Äôt prison slop, and a look that said he‚Äôd expect me to be useful.

I slept that night like a man who had been given a purpose: not a tidy redemption‚Äîdon‚Äôt call it that‚Äîbut a reason to use my appetite for ruin in a way that paid rent and cut a bigger target. I still like killing. I‚Äôll admit that. I like the small noise it makes when someone realizes the world has ended for them. It sharpens me. It tells me I am awake.

But now there‚Äôs a pattern to it. I cut on command, stitch when necessary. Raven Flies gave me a band: blades and an order, chaos with a direction. I‚Äôm still a criminal. I always will be. But I learned to keep my hands for something that feels‚Ä¶ useful. Not kind. Useful.

When rain hits the alley and the city hums like a beast with a belly full of neon and blood, I sharpen my knives, grin, and remember the night a man in glasses asked me if I was good with knives. He opened a cell door and gave me a reason to stop being alone. That‚Äôs enough.





CODES AND PATCHES

Celare

I move too fast for most people. I always have. Fingers that learned stitches at dawn learned keyboards by midnight. Stitch, stitch, cut, cut ‚Äî that rhythm lives in me. I don‚Äôt explain. I do. That‚Äôs the difference.

Tonight the room smells like plastic and stale coffee and the thin metallic tang of opportunity. Screens crowd the wall like a choir. Tickers flicker in the corner, red and green in a maddening heartbeat. Somebody hired me to push numbers ‚Äî depress a portfolio, spike a shell company, make a board sweat in their suits. They paid well. They paid in cash and in data, and in this city cash is a kin to oxygen.

I don‚Äôt like being bought, but I like the clean certainty of a job done. You feed me code and a window and I will make their balance sheets bleed. I tap keys. Fingers are instruments. My clinic trained the hands; crime trained the speed. I‚Äôm three windows deep: exchange one, proxy matrix two, backdoor three. The packet flow is a language. I read it. I talk back.

‚ÄúFive seconds,‚Äù I mutter. No time for theatrics. The countdown blinks like a metronome. The client wants panic on the trading floor. They want a short squeeze that smells like justice. I don‚Äôt do justice; I do work. But sometimes work tastes like the same thing.

A flood of orders. Servers cough. A synthetic loop hides my hand. I push the payload. Every second a fraction of a decision. Seventeen servers, three mirrors, one choke point. They‚Äôll lose millions in sixty seconds or less. Good. Rich men flinch. Good.

Then the door breathes open. I don‚Äôt look. I feel it ‚Äî small footprint, patient. Rainware on a coat. Glasses catching light like tiny alarms. I keep my eyes on the screen. Don‚Äôt raise your voice when knives are whispering. Control the room and you control what wakes up.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be hired for this by them,‚Äù the voice says. Not loud. Just precise. He walks like someone who counts floorboards for fun. I let the code finish. The market stumbles. Numbers gasp on the screen. Red blooms like a wound.

‚ÄúYou watch me for a while,‚Äù I say, not turning. ‚ÄúYou want a lecture? I don‚Äôt give those. You want to arrest me? You‚Äôll need something louder than glasses.‚Äù My hands don‚Äôt miss a beat. I archive the trace. I slip a salt-and-pepper wipe over my console so no one later pins me like an insect.

He leans on the doorway, eyes behind glass. ‚ÄúYou were hired to spike corpo stocks,‚Äù he says. Statement, not question. He watches the feeds like a man checking a pulse. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúMoney,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúAlways money. Sometimes curiosity. Sometimes because it looks like a good bandage.‚Äù Short. Sharp. Honest. I like honesty. It‚Äôs rare.

He doesn‚Äôt push. He watches the aftermath ‚Äî the panic threads, the private channels lighting up like flares. ‚ÄúYou patch people,‚Äù he says after a moment. ‚ÄúYou patch systems. You used to be a doctor.‚Äù

‚ÄúUsed to be,‚Äù I correct. ‚ÄúStill am in sticky places. You yank a man from a table and you need both hands.‚Äù I finally turn, only a fraction. My face is tired and small lines have learned how to be efficient. ‚ÄúYou want something from me?‚Äù

He steps forward. Rain dapples his coat. He speaks like someone making a diagnosis. ‚ÄúRaven Flies needs people who can fix what matters and erase the trail. We move when the city leaks. We patch what we can. We cut what we must.‚Äù He says it without the drama a recruit pamphlet would have. It sounded like a diagnosis.

Most surround themselves with mayhem and blood. I prefer to work in the shadows, behind the veil. I patch in the dark, not the theater.

‚ÄúYou want me to work for you because I can make markets wobble and make bodies breathe,‚Äù I say. Rapid-fire. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trading me one kind of chaos for another. What‚Äôs in it for me besides a purpose?‚Äù

‚ÄúPeople who won‚Äôt come back if you don‚Äôt fix them,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNames on lists you won‚Äôt find printed. Labs you‚Äôve already seen in off-hours. We get to hold the ones we pull out. You get to keep doing the thing you do, without some CEO calling the shots.‚Äù

It‚Äôs honest and ugly. I count the reasons in my head: no more anonymous payments that leave lipstick on knives; access to feeds I can‚Äôt buy with any ledger; the chance to patch people I won‚Äôt see shipped off again. The clinic in me twitches at the possibility.

‚ÄúYou need guarantees,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt trust promises.‚Äù I flick a sticky pad at him ‚Äî a tiny device that will ping if he steps out of line. Old habits. Old safety.

He smiles the smallest smile. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do guarantees. We do fights. You want to keep your hands cleanish, work for us. There‚Äôs food, a kit, a roof that doesn‚Äôt belong to the suits. And‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt sell people to labs.‚Äù

Short pause. The markets outside still hiccup. Somewhere someone swears.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù I say. Quick. Done. No oaths. No parades. I take the card like a scalpel. He hands a small kit then and there ‚Äî not a big show, just a cloth case with a few items I don‚Äôt have and will use. He watches me pack it with the kind of attention a surgeon gives a patient.

We step out into the rain together like two people who have the same bad habit: fixing what should probably stay broken. Tive walks slow; I walk fast. We make an odd team. He trusts patience and timing. I trust that things break and that with enough speed you can make the break useful.

On the walk back, he doesn‚Äôt talk much. He doesn‚Äôt need to. I already know the sounds the city makes when it bleeds, and I already know the seams to patch. Raven Flies wants a fixer who moves too fast to be bought. I like being fast.

He left me in a room that smelled like disinfectant and code and a little like hope, with a thicker wallet and a smaller payment schedule. He left me with a name and a number. He left me with access to things I‚Äôd only dreamed of cracking. He left and the rain ate his footprints.

I patch systems. I patch people. I don‚Äôt sing about it. I don‚Äôt need to. The city hums and I work in the seams.

And when my hands get tired, I tell myself I‚Äôll sleep. Then I open the case and get to work.





Judge, Jury N' Executioner

Linus

Rain softens the city‚Äôs edges until everything looks like a smear of ink. I lay on the roof and watch it blur. The Judge rests in my hands, cold and familiar. Jury thumps against my hips, twin pistols balanced like old friends. The Executioner hangs easy across my back, a short barrel I keep for when some up-close honesty is required. I check em like a preacher checks his prayers ‚Äî slow, deliberate, respectful.

There‚Äôs a man below who thinks a title can hide a life. He‚Äôs got smiles in the right places and hands that sign the wrong papers. He‚Äôs crooked by trade. He‚Äôs the sort of man I breathe the hardest for. I can‚Äôt see my kid. Haven't in a while. So I keep a rule for my boys sake. Shoot fellers as need shootin‚Äô n‚Äô save fellers as need savin‚Äô. I aim true and then I come home with as little noise as possible.

I ease a coil of rope over the parapet, fingers practiced. The wind‚Äôs a whisper, the rain a metronome. Tying up is polite. It lets you choose when the world sees you. I lower myself until the Judge finds the line of sight. The alley narrows below like a throat. The target‚Äôs driver leans out for a smoke, careless. A lookout paces the far side of the courtyard, bored and warm. First, the lookout.

The judge is patient. I breathe slowly, find the seam between rain and wind, and squeeze. The shot is a bell in the wet night ‚Äî slender, terrible ‚Äî and the lookout folds without a sound. People think snipers are merciless. They forget the mercy in ending it clean; a single bullet can spare a dozen screams.

I drop the last few feet to the fire escape and drop to the alley as if I‚Äôve always lived in shadows. The city receives me like an old acquaintance ‚Äî indifferent, bright, hungry. No show. No swagger. Just work.

A pair of goons step from the glass doors, pistol-ready, faces wet with rain and surprise. One draws slow. Jury is quicker. Two practiced snaps; two clean complaints. No flashing. No grandstanding. I let the pistols speak and they shut the night like a lid.

The executive‚Äôs men scatter, thinking feet and numbers will save him. He bolts toward a service entrance ‚Äî coward‚Äôs routes tend to leak ‚Äî and that‚Äôs when Executioner becomes necessary. I don‚Äôt like loud. I don‚Äôt like spectacle. But a sawed-off whispers close justice: a short bark that ends movement and the option to run. I give him the choice briefly ‚Äî a tilt of the hat that‚Äôs half courtesy, half verdict ‚Äî then I make it final. The Executioner coughs once and the corridor becomes quiet enough to hear the rain.

There‚Äôs an economy to violence. Economy keeps you alive and makes sure you sleep. I clean my hands on my coat and step back into the shadows. No cheering. No cameras catching the smile. Just the wet pavement and the tracker lights going dull in the distance as their security thinks through what went wrong.

I take a breath and think of my kid. That thought steadies me more than a prayer ever did. People call me a killer. The papers stamped my name when they needed a headline ‚Äî the vice president‚Äôs body, the blame, the bounty. They don‚Äôt know my ledger. They don‚Äôt know my rules. My gun‚Äôs barrel remembers the names of those I promised to take. It keeps me honest.

I move away from the corpses like a man who doesn‚Äôt want to smell of blood. The city hums its neon hymn and my mind is quiet, because I don‚Äôt enjoy the taking. I respect it. I measure it. That‚Äôs what separates me from the rabble who bathe in gore and call it virtue.

A figure steps out of an alcove like he‚Äôs part of the rain. Small, black coat, glasses glinting ‚Äî Tive. He doesn‚Äôt hurry. He doesn‚Äôt judge my work out loud. He watches it, like a doctor watches the pulse after an incision. His gaze is the sort that catalogs things: how the men fell, the angles, the way I left the alley.

‚ÄúYou aim clean,‚Äù he says. Not a question. Report. He steps closer, rain beading on his coat. ‚ÄúYou got restraint.‚Äù

I tilt my hat. ‚ÄúI got my rules.‚Äù

He nods, the kind of nod that means he knows what rules look like on a man. ‚ÄúRaven Flies moves the same way,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt make a mess if we don‚Äôt have to. We close the wound.‚Äù

There‚Äôs an invitation in his voice, but not the kind that comes with parades. No banners, no promises. Just a place that wants someone like me ‚Äî someone who can be the quiet hand that balances out all the noise.

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù I ask. I don‚Äôt need him to flatter me. I need him to be straight.

‚ÄúBecause you aim to the heart of the problem and then you leave people a chance to breathe,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt enjoy the spectacle. That‚Äôs rare. We value rare.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a lot unsaid in that sentence. There always is. Tive watches me with unblinking patience, like a man who‚Äôs been cataloguing sins and instruments for longer than he lets anyone know. He steps back into the rain and produces a thin card with a name I already know murmured in dark places: *Raven Flies.*

‚ÄúYou got a kid?‚Äù he asks after a beat, softer now.

I close my hand around the card like it‚Äôs a warrant or a promise. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt see ‚Äôem. Can‚Äôt touch ‚Äôem. Not yet.‚Äù

Tive‚Äôs face folds a fraction into knowingness. ‚ÄúThen you might want to be useful for more than yourself. We don‚Äôt promise reunions. We promise work. We promise targets. We promise we don‚Äôt shoot the wrong men.‚Äù

I study the card, the rain, the street where men lie still. The city is patient. My rules are patient too. I fold the card and tuck it away.

‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I say. Short. Final. I don‚Äôt sing about being noble. I don‚Äôt make speeches about justice. I make sure the bad men stop being a threat to the people I can‚Äôt touch.

Tive offers a small nod. ‚ÄúWe move at night. We leave before the daylight asks questions. If you want the kid back sooner, act like a man who can vanish clean. We‚Äôll teach the rest.‚Äù

I lift Judge to my shoulder for a long second, feeling the cold familiar weight. ‚ÄúI aim for the guilty,‚Äù I tell him. ‚ÄúNot the innocent. Not the cowards who don‚Äôt deserve the fight.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you‚Äôll fit,‚Äù he says.

Rain gathers on my brim. I tuck the card into my coat and step back onto the fire escape, Judge humming like a patient horse. The city runs on neon and blood and the occasional man with a rule. Tonight I added another name to my ledger. Maybe it buys me time. Maybe it gets my kid one step closer. Maybe it gives me work worth doing.

I drop into the dark and move like I‚Äôve always moved: quiet, steady, and true. Judge, Jury, and Executioner are back in their places. The rain drowns the last of the noise. I walk away with my hands clean enough to look in a mirror.",1,1759836605.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I have wound issues under both breasts that appear to be some necrosis directly on the incisions about 4 inches in length.  I‚Äôm not too worried about them.  I started using silver Manuka honey for several days followed by just letting them get air with only wearing a white tshirt no bra so nothing is rubbing on them.  There is healthy pink tissue around it forming so I feel like it‚Äôs healing.  However I also have incisions that come to a V in the cleavage along both breasts and the right breast at the top, about 2 inches it not healing.  I just finished 14 days of antibiotics just what I was sent home with Keflex I believe.  There is some slough on the wound and it looks kind of stringy/fibrous?   I have tried silver honey, silvadene, and just Manuka honey. I shower daily with medical grade antibacterial soap and use a soaked gauze pad with Vashe wound wash and let that sit on the wounds for about 10 minutes.  Then I cover the two under my breasts with silvadene and then Xeroform dressing and cover.  Repeat daily.  The cleavage one really can‚Äôt get any dressing in there so just using silvadene now.  

I have been eating 150~170 grams of protein, 80-120 ounces of water, lots of fruits and veggies and heavily limit sugar. I also take 30 grams of vital proteins collagen in my coffee daily.  2000 mg vitamin C, multivitamin, 50 mg Zinc. And 10,000 IU of D3 and taking Juven to promote healing. 

What else can I do?  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs infected. This is my second plastic surgery to remove excess skin following 141 pound weight loss and I have been a healthy weight for about a year.  Mid 50s post menopause.  I‚Äôm on estradiol and progesterone compounded for menopause.  I have discontinued Zepbound due to concerns with wound healing.  I had stopped two weeks prior to my surgery.  

Is there anything different than I should be doing to help these wounds heal?  I have been regularly sending pictures to my surgeons office and speaking to his PA for advice. I had wound issues with my first skin removal surgery and did seek wound care so I learned a lot through that experience. I will see wound care again. If I have to. I just feel like not at that point yet. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",1,1759836525.0,BreastLifts,0,1.0,False

1o0c2lw,https://i.redd.it/23lmzrz0dotf1.png,üß† So What‚Äôs the Difference Between the 2 Top Modafinils ‚Äî Modalert and Modvigil?,"# üß† So What‚Äôs the Difference Between the 2 Top Modafinils ‚Äî Modalert and Modvigil?

If you‚Äôve spent any time looking into **Modafinil**, you‚Äôve probably seen two names pop up again and again: **Modalert** and **Modvigil**.  
They‚Äôre both extremely popular, Always well priced and both used around the world for focus, wakefulness, and long productivity sessions.

So what‚Äôs the actual difference? Let‚Äôs break it down clearly.

# ‚öóÔ∏è The Basics ‚Äî Same Core Ingredient

Both Modalert and Modvigil contain the same active compound: **Modafinil (200 mg per tablet)**.  
They act on similar pathways ‚Äî primarily targeting dopamine and orexin systems in the brain ‚Äî to promote alertness and sustained mental performance without traditional stimulant effects.

So in simple terms, **they‚Äôre two brands of the same molecule**.  
The difference lies in **who makes them, how they‚Äôre formulated, and how they feel**.

# üè≠ Who Makes What

|Brand|Manufacturer|Country|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Modalert**|Sun Pharma|India|One of India‚Äôs largest and most reputable pharma companies.|
|**Modvigil**|HAB Pharma|India|Smaller manufacturer, known for affordable generics.|

Both are **legitimate pharmaceutical-grade products**, not research-lab compounds or grey-market powders.

# üß© What People Actually Notice

Even though they share the same active ingredient, users often describe a slightly **different ‚Äúfeel‚Äù** between them.

|Feature|**Modalert**|**Modvigil**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Onset|Slightly faster|Gradual, smoother|
|Duration|10‚Äì12 hrs|8‚Äì10 hrs|
|Perceived focus|Sharper, cleaner lift|Milder, less jittery|
|Price|Usually higher|Often 10‚Äì20% cheaper|
|Energy curve|More ‚Äúupfront‚Äù|More balanced|

# üß† Why the Difference Exists

The differences mainly come from **inactive ingredients** (binders, fillers) and possibly **particle size / absorption rate**.  
These can affect how quickly Modafinil enters your bloodstream, giving Modalert that ‚Äúclean kick‚Äù and Modvigil a softer ramp-up.

It‚Äôs similar to how two coffees with the same caffeine dose can feel slightly different depending on roast and brew.

# üí¨ Which One Is ‚ÄúBetter‚Äù?

There isn‚Äôt a universal winner ‚Äî it depends on your goals and tolerance.

* If you want a **crisp, energetic start** to your day: **Modalert** is often the favorite.
* If you prefer **gentle, steady clarity** and less chance of overstimulation: **Modvigil** might be your pick.
* Some users even **alternate** between them ‚Äî Modalert for high-output days, Modvigil for maintenance.

Ultimately, it‚Äôs about finding your rhythm.

# üß™ Pro Tip: Armodafinil vs. Modafinil

If you want a longer, smoother effect, look into **Armodafinil (R-enantiomer Modafinil)** ‚Äî found in products like **Armodacare** or **Waklert**.  
It‚Äôs the same family, just refined for longer half-life and slightly different feel.

# ü¶Ü Bottom Line

Modalert and Modvigil both deliver the same Modafinil magic, consistently, everytime ‚Äî alertness, clarity, and sustained focus ‚Äî but their *feel* and *tempo* differ.  
Choose based on what kind of day you‚Äôre trying to optimize:

* **Modalert:** crisp, fast, powerful.
* **Modvigil:** smooth, balanced, dependable.

Both remain two of the best-tested cognitive enhancers on the market ‚Äî the rest is just preference.

The ocean stopped making a sound last night.  
No listen carefully. I don‚Äôt mean it quieted like the tide going out, or like some faraway storm had passed. I mean it¬†*stopped*. Froze. The air grew heavy, thick enough to taste like metal and rot, and then the waves just ceased. No crash, no hiss, no pull. The sea went still as bone under the moonlight.

I stood there, staring at that impossible calm, wondering if maybe I‚Äôd gone deaf somewhere between one breath and the next. It was only when I noticed my own heartbeat pounding in my ears that I realized I could still hear just fine. Everything else, though the ocean, the gulls, the wind had gone quiet.

I‚Äôve lived on this shoreline for years, watching those waves every morning with my coffee, every night with my whiskey. And not once, in all that time, did it ever stop moving. Until last night.

At first I thought it was beautiful the way the water had frozen in place, black and glassy as obsidian, reflecting the stars like a thousand little knives. The smell of salt was gone. The dampness in the air, gone too. Even the sand felt wrong too dry, too powdery, almost¬†*desert-like*. I knelt, pressed my hand into it, expecting to feel that cool, wet give beneath my fingers. But instead it was warm, sifting away in thin, pale dust. Like crushed bone.

That‚Äôs when the dread started to build.

It wasn‚Äôt just the silence. It was the way the air seemed heavier with every breath, pressing against my ribs, making each inhale a little harder than the last. My heart started racing, my pulse twitching in my throat. I wanted to step back, to move away from the still water but my legs wouldn‚Äôt listen. Something about the ocean held me there. Not fear, exactly, but a kind of terrible fascination.

I told myself I‚Äôd only stay a minute. Just to watch. Just to see if the tide would pick up again. But the seconds stretched, soft and endless, while that dry sand shifted faintly beneath my feet.

And then something¬†*broke*¬†inside that silence.

It was faint at first, like the ghost of a sound. A hollow, far-away rushing, like a whisper sliding down a long tunnel. My skin prickled. The ocean began to darken, turning from glassy black to something thicker, something almost gelatinous. A slow ripple crept across the surface, then another, building and building and building until suddenly, the water convulsed.

A single wave rose up from the stillness. Not high, not monstrous just impossibly¬†*wrong*. It didn‚Äôt glitter or foam or glisten. It was¬†*dry*. The whole thing looked like smoke shaped into a wave, a brittle sculpture ready to crumble if you touched it. Yet it moved. Slowly, deliberately. Toward me.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I swear, I could hear it shifting like sandpaper grinding against glass as it dragged itself forward, inch by inch. I wanted to run, but every nerve in my body trembled, locking me in place.

When it finally hit the shore, it didn‚Äôt splash. It¬†*shattered*.

The noise was unbearable like a thousand bones snapping at once. Fragments of what once was water scattered across the sand, dissolving into clouds of pale dust. The smell rushed in then, sharp and putrid, like dead fish left to rot under the sun. I gagged. It coated my tongue. My lips cracked, my skin itched, and when I wiped my mouth, my fingers came away gray.

I remember blinking, trying to clear my vision, but the stars above had vanished. The horizon, the moon, everything swallowed in darkness deeper than any night I‚Äôd ever seen.

And somewhere, beneath that silence, came a sound. A low, rhythmic pulsing. Not like waves, no not anymore. It was slower.¬†*Deeper.*¬†A heartbeat, vast and deliberate, coming from beneath the shore.

I stepped back, but the sand shifted again, crumbling underfoot like an hourglass spilling out of itself. My heel sank, and something cold brushed my ankle. I jerked away too late. The sand was crawling. Not just moving,¬†*breathing*. The grains stirred like insects, alive with some hidden pulse.

The voices began after that.

They came out of the hollow wind, brittle and whispering, mixed with the rhythmic thud beneath the ground.¬†**‚ÄúCome back,‚Äù**¬†they said.¬†**‚ÄúThe sea remembers.‚Äù**  
I started running. My lungs burned with every breath of that dry, stifling air, but I didn‚Äôt care. I just ran. The sound followed me dry whispers, breaking bones, the heartbeat pounding louder, closer, closer.

When I risked a glance over my shoulder, I saw the shoreline heaving, lifting, twisting. The whole beach seemed to collapse inward, sand folding over itself, the ocean‚Äîor whatever had become of it pouring forward in solid, gray waves. No water spilled. Instead,¬†*bodies*¬†began to emerge.

Slick, pale, and blind, they crawled from beneath the bone-dry tide skeletal hands clawing through the sediment. Not corpses, not exactly. More like the memory of them. Hollow faces stretched open where mouths should be, filled with sand and darkness. And through it all, that sound:¬†**‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù**

I didn‚Äôt stop running until the lights of the town rose behind me, shimmering faint through the haze.

But the air was wrong here too.

Even now, sitting inside, I can‚Äôt shake the dryness from my throat. I keep drinking water, but the taste is off flat, metallic, dust-laden. The pipes rattle like there‚Äôs air trapped inside them, though the taps run full. My windows are coated in a faint layer of gray powder that returns every time I wipe it away.

I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I hear that pulse again the one that sounded like the ocean‚Äôs heart, beating beneath the dry sand. Louder now. Closer. I think it followed me back here.

Maybe it never stopped following anyone.

Sometimes, in the early hours, I hear something tapping faintly against the wall near my bed. Slow and deliberate. Like waves lapping at the shore. Only there‚Äôs no water outside anymore. The sea itself looks dead just a flat expanse of colorless dust stretching to the horizon.

And still, the sound persists. Building and building and building.

They say the ocean always takes back what belongs to it. I used to think that meant drowned sailors and scattered wrecks. But now, I‚Äôm beginning to think it means¬†*everything*.

I can feel the air tightening again tonight, the silence crawling up through my chest, pressing on my ribs like a hand. The lights are flickering, dimming in pulses, and a faint gray mist is gathering by the door.

If I listen closely, I can hear the dry crash of waves just beyond the porch. No water. No wind. Only that terrible rasp of dust against dust.

**The Timeless Story of Mother of Pearl - Where Did It All Begin?**

# What is Mother of Pearl and Why Has It Been Cherished for Centuries?

Mother of Pearl, often known as *nacre*, is the iridescent inner layer found inside seashells such as oysters and abalones. For centuries, artisans have admired its natural shimmer, durability, and elegance. When used in furniture, it transforms simple wood into something poetic - each tiny fragment reflecting light like captured moonlight.

 **Mother of Pearl furniture is handcrafted using natural shell inlays, polished into wooden surfaces to create intricate designs that symbolize beauty, prosperity, and luxury.**

From royal palaces in Saudi Arabia to heritage homes in India, Mother of Pearl inlay furniture has been a mark of prestige and craftsmanship. Even today, a Mother of Pearl coffee table or console table is not just a piece of d√©cor - it‚Äôs a story of artistry, culture, and timeless beauty passed through generations.

# How Did Mother of Pearl Furniture Emerge in Ancient Asia and the Middle East?

The story of Mother of Pearl furniture is deeply rooted in Asian and Middle Eastern traditions. Early records trace its origins to ancient Syria and Korea, where craftsmen began embedding thin layers of natural shell into wood and lacquer surfaces. Syrian mother of pearl furniture, known for its geometric and floral motifs, was prized in royal courts and mosques across the Levant. These artisans mastered the art of *inlaid shell furniture*, setting the foundation for what later became a global symbol of refinement.

In Korea, this craft evolved differently. The **Korean Mother of Pearl furniture** tradition combined black lacquer and iridescent shellwork, creating a breathtaking contrast that remains iconic. Korean artisans were among the first to perfect **black lacquer Mother of Pearl furniture**, adorning cabinets, folding tables, and wardrobes with meticulous precision. Each piece mirrored not just beauty but also spirituality - a reminder of balance, patience, and devotion.

India, too, contributed richly to the story. In the coastal regions of Rajasthan and Gujarat, craftsmen developed *bone inlay* and *mother of pearl inlay furniture* side by side. Indian artisans learned to cut and polish natural shell pieces into floral and arabesque patterns, often inspired by Mughal architecture. These techniques soon spread to other parts of Asia, merging influences from Arab traders and Persian artists.

# Why Were Royal Palaces and Villa Decorated with Mother of Pearl Inlay Furniture?

Mother of Pearl was more than decoration - it was status, symbolism, and sanctity. In ancient palaces of Damascus and Aleppo, **Syrian inlaid furniture** adorned royal chambers and grand halls. The glimmer of Mother of Pearl under candlelight created an aura of divine beauty, often seen as a connection between heaven and earth.

In Villas and mosques, inlaid furniture and doors were believed to reflect purity and faith. Over time, this spiritual symbolism turned into a cultural standard - from the palaces of Riyadh to heritage homes in Jaipur. The beauty of Mother of Pearl wasn‚Äôt just in its shine but in what it represented - patience, artistry, and a respect for nature‚Äôs rare gifts.

# What Role Did Korean Black Lacquer and Syrian Inlay Play in Global Furniture Heritage?

The techniques developed in Korea and Syria shaped the future of luxury furniture worldwide. Korean *black lacquer Mother of Pearl cabinets* and Syrian *inlaid sideboards* became sought-after treasures among traders traveling between the East and Europe. By the 18th and 19th centuries, these pieces began appearing in European collections and later influenced designs in Morocco, Egypt, and even modern Dubai.

Today, artisans in Seoul, Damascus, and Marrakech continue these age-old methods, blending them with modern design sensibilities. You can find **Korean Mother of Pearl coffee tables**, **Syrian console tables**, and **Moroccan inlay furniture** in luxury homes from Doha to New York. Leading *custom furniture suppliers* and *antique collectors* are reviving this legacy by merging traditional artistry with contemporary interiors - ensuring that every **Mother of Pearl dresser**, **side table**, or **cabinet** retains its authentic soul.

From the shores of Asia to the palaces of the Middle East, the journey of Mother of Pearl furniture is a tale of shared heritage. It‚Äôs a reminder that true luxury doesn‚Äôt fade - it evolves. Each shimmering inlay on a **Mother of Pearl table** whispers stories of the past while illuminating the present, connecting artisans, cultures, and collectors across centuries and continents.

**Mother of pearl furniture evolved from royal palaces to modern interiors through craftsmanship that harmonizes heritage with luxury design across global homes and hotels.**

# Why Are Collectors and Designers in Dubai, Doha, and London Drawn to Mother of Pearl Inlay Furniture?

Designers and collectors in cities like Dubai, Doha, and London are captivated by the duality of *mother of pearl furniture* \- its heritage and versatility. Each *mother of pearl cabinet*, *dresser*, or *sideboard* carries the story of meticulous handcrafting, often taking weeks or months to complete. The result is not just furniture but a piece of history that embodies patience, precision, and passion.

In the UAE, it has become a signature of refined taste in royal suites and exclusive hotels. In Qatar and Kuwait, *mother of pearl side tables* and *round coffee tables* are used to balance modern architecture with a touch of Eastern warmth. Meanwhile, in London‚Äôs luxury homes, the mix of *antique mother of pearl tables* and modern *pearl inlay dressers* has become a hallmark of understated sophistication.

The appeal lies in the texture and light - when natural light touches the inlay, the furniture seems to glow from within, creating a serene, ethereal effect that no other material can match.

# What Makes Korean, Syrian, and Indian Techniques Unique in Today‚Äôs Luxury Market?

Each region brings its soul into *mother of pearl inlay furniture*.

* **Korean artisans** specialize in *black lacquer mother of pearl furniture*, where shimmering shells are delicately set on jet-black surfaces - an aesthetic deeply rooted in their Joseon Dynasty heritage. The *Korean mother of pearl tables* and cabinets often tell stories of nature, cranes, and moonlit gardens.  
* **Syrian craftsmanship** thrives on geometric perfection. The *Syrian mother of pearl tables* and *inlaid cabinets* combine walnut or rosewood with intricate patterns inspired by Islamic architecture. Their artistry has traveled to luxury homes from Jeddah to Bahrain.  
* **Indian artisans**, especially from Rajasthan, blend bone and pearl inlays on *ivory inlay dressers* and *mother of pearl wardrobes*, merging Mughal opulence with modern simplicity.  

In today‚Äôs global market, collectors and hoteliers seek these regional variations to add authenticity and soul to interiors. Whether it‚Äôs a *Korean black lacquer coffee table* or a *Syrian mother of pearl console table*, each piece connects centuries-old craftsmanship to today‚Äôs luxury living.

# How Do Antique Mother of Pearl Tables and Dressers Inspire Modern Designers?

Modern designers often revisit *antique mother of pearl furniture* to find inspiration for new creations. The proportions, the detailing, the harmony of materials - all influence today‚Äôs luxury design. For instance, an *antique Chinese mother of pearl table* with floral motifs might inspire a minimalist *mother of pearl inlay dining table* for a contemporary villa in Bahrain or a boutique hotel in Manchester.

The evolution isn‚Äôt about imitation but reinterpretation. By blending traditional techniques with modern silhouettes, designers create furniture that feels timeless yet fresh - like a *mother of pearl coffee table* paired with marble flooring or a *pearl bedside table* beside a velvet headboard.

As global awareness grows toward slow design and craftsmanship, *mother of pearl inlay furniture* represents sustainability, beauty, and legacy. Each piece carries the patience of human hands and the shimmer of nature‚Äôs own art - the pearl itself.

The journey of *mother of pearl furniture* mirrors the story of art itself - born in tradition, shaped by travel, and reborn through innovation. From Korean palaces to Arabian villas and British townhouses, it continues to be more than d√©cor - it‚Äôs a link between heritage and modern luxury, glowing softly across time and continents.

**What Makes Each Mother of Pearl Piece a Work of Art?**¬†

# How Are Mother of Pearl Tables, Dressers, and Cabinets Handcrafted?

Every piece of *mother of pearl furniture* begins with patience - and ends as poetry in form. The process, though centuries old, remains beautifully human. Artisans handpick shells from the sea - often abalone, oyster, or pearl shells - for their natural luster and strength. Each fragment is cleaned, cut into tiny shapes, and then carefully set into carved wooden surfaces using age-old techniques passed down through generations.

In workshops from Rajasthan to Seoul, and from Damascus to Muscat, craftsmen work long hours perfecting symmetry. A *mother of pearl coffee table* or *dresser* can take weeks to finish, as every petal or geometric motif is individually inlaid. Once the pattern is complete, the surface is sanded and polished until the inlay glows with a soft, iridescent light.

The wood used - often *rosewood*, *walnut*, or *teak* \- provides the warmth and contrast that let the shells truly shine. Whether it‚Äôs a *mother of pearl console table* in a Doha villa or a *pearl inlay side table* in a Toronto penthouse, the final result is a living canvas of craftsmanship and devotion.

 Mother of pearl furniture is handcrafted through meticulous inlaying of natural shells into carved wood, polished to create iridescent patterns symbolizing heritage and beauty.

# What Is the Meaning Behind Mother of Pearl Patterns and Symbolism?

The patterns found on *mother of pearl inlay furniture* are not just decorative - they tell stories. The floral motifs seen on many *mother of pearl cabinets* or *dressers* symbolize renewal and purity, while the geometric latticework represents eternity and divine order. In Arabic and Asian cultures, the iridescent shimmer of the shell signifies light, wisdom, and serenity - qualities believed to bring peace and prosperity into a home.

A *mother of pearl nightstand* adorned with lotus patterns, for instance, embodies purity and awakening - perfect for bedroom interiors that seek calmness and reflection. In contrast, a *mother of pearl inlay table* featuring intertwined vines reflects growth and connection, making it ideal for living rooms or lounges in luxury hotels across Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

This spiritual connection between nature and artistry is what makes these creations timeless. Every curve and every motif carries deeper meaning - a bridge between craftsmanship and culture.

# Which Pieces Define Elegance: From Mother of Pearl Coffee Tables to Nightstands and Sideboards?

Elegance in *mother of pearl furniture* lies in its versatility. A single *mother of pearl coffee table* can transform a minimalist space into something radiant, while a *mother of pearl console table* makes a perfect entryway statement in a villa or hotel lobby.

For bedrooms, a *mother of pearl nightstand* or *dresser* introduces luxury in subtle tones, pairing beautifully with velvet upholstery or silk curtains. Dining rooms in Oman and Kuwait often feature *mother of pearl sideboards* and *inlay dining tables* as centerpieces, merging tradition with fine living.

Modern designers in Canada and the UAE often pair *mother of pearl drawers* with marble or brass finishes - blending traditional art with modern minimalism. Each piece, whether antique or contemporary, is built to stand out while quietly complementing its surroundings.

What defines elegance is not just appearance, but emotion - the way a *mother of pearl side table* catches sunlight or how a *pearl inlay coffee table* glows under warm evening lamps. It‚Äôs an art that interacts with light and time.

# How Does Natural Pearl Reflect Light and Luxury in Interior Spaces?

There‚Äôs a reason why no two *mother of pearl tables* look the same - nature never repeats its patterns. The luminous surface, known for its ‚Äúliving light,‚Äù changes hues as it interacts with its environment. This ever-changing reflection gives interiors a dynamic yet soothing quality, something designers in Doha, Riyadh, and Toronto value deeply.

A *round mother of pearl coffee table* or *black lacquer mother of pearl cabinet* captures this essence perfectly - glowing differently in morning sunlight and evening ambience. It is this organic luminosity that defines luxury beyond materials or price.

When placed in interiors designed with natural tones or soft golds, *mother of pearl inlay furniture* amplifies elegance without overpowering the space. The light seems to breathe, adding warmth and soul to modern design.

Each *mother of pearl dresser*, *cabinet*, or *coffee table* is not merely furniture - it‚Äôs the meeting point of nature, art, and patience. From a craftsman‚Äôs humble bench to a royal suite in Doha or a penthouse in Vancouver, every piece tells its own story. The shimmer you see is not just light on shell - it‚Äôs a reflection of human touch, heritage, and heart.

In a world driven by speed, *mother of pearl furniture* reminds us that true luxury still takes time - and that beauty, when born of patience and purpose, will always find its place in the light.

**How Are Global Designers and Hotels Reviving Mother of Pearl in Modern Interiors?**

# How Are Luxury Hotels and Palaces in the UAE and Saudi Arabia Showcasing Mother of Pearl Furniture?

In the Middle East, luxury is not only a statement - it‚Äôs a story told through craftsmanship. In recent years, *mother of pearl furniture* has found its way into the grandest hotels and royal palaces of the *United Arab Emirates* and *Saudi Arabia*, symbolizing both heritage and refinement.

Architects and hospitality curators in cities like *Dubai*, *Abu Dhabi*, and *Riyadh* are blending this ancient artistry with contemporary design. Imagine a *mother of pearl dining table set* glowing softly under chandelier light in a palace banquet hall or a *mother of pearl entryway table* greeting guests at the entrance of a five-star hotel - each piece radiating warmth, craftsmanship, and cultural pride.

In many luxury villas and suites, *mother of pearl bedroom furniture* and *sofa tables* are now custom-designed to match modern interiors while preserving traditional artistry. This balance between heritage and minimalism allows spaces to feel both rooted and refined. The iridescent surface of pearl inlay catches the desert light beautifully - a visual poetry that fits seamlessly with the architectural rhythm of the Gulf.

**Luxury hotels in the UAE and Saudi Arabia use mother of pearl furniture to blend traditional Middle Eastern craftsmanship with modern elegance, creating luminous, culturally rich interiors.**

**Why Are Architects and Interior Designers in Qatar, Kuwait, and Oman Returning to Handcrafted Artistry?**

In a world dominated by mass production, designers in *Qatar*, *Kuwait*, and *Oman* are leading a quiet movement back toward handmade luxury. They see *mother of pearl inlay furniture* not as d√©cor, but as heritage reborn. These nations, rich in cultural identity, value the slow art of creation - the same patience that defines the inlay process itself.

Modern architectural firms in Doha and Muscat now collaborate directly with *antique handcrafted hotel furniture suppliers* to revive rare techniques from Syria and India. From the intricate detailing of a *mother of pearl dresser* to the refined lines of a *pearl console table*, every piece becomes a conversation between history and innovation.

This return to craftsmanship is not nostalgic - it‚Äôs purposeful. By using sustainable materials and reviving ancient artistry, designers are making a statement: true luxury lies in authenticity. Whether it‚Äôs a *mother of pearl cabinet* in a beachfront resort or an *inlaid dining table* in a royal majlis, each creation honors the hand that shaped it.

# How Is Mother of Pearl Furniture Blending Tradition with Modern Aesthetics in the US and UK?

Across the Atlantic, *mother of pearl furniture* has become a symbol of quiet opulence in modern Western design. In *New York penthouses*, *London townhouses*, and luxury residences in *California* or *Manchester*, designers are reinterpreting this Eastern craft with a minimalist touch.

A *mother of pearl coffee table* might now sit beneath an abstract chandelier, or a *mother of pearl console table* may stand against a wall finished in matte concrete - the contrast between organic shimmer and industrial tone creating perfect harmony.

This East-meets-West design language reflects a broader shift toward meaningful luxury. Homeowners and decorators in the US and UK increasingly seek pieces that carry depth and origin, not just beauty. *Mother of pearl inlay furniture* answers that need - it tells a story, yet fits perfectly in modern living spaces.

Even global hospitality brands like Four Seasons, The Ritz-Carlton, and Mandarin Oriental have begun integrating *mother of pearl dining tables* and *inlay sideboards* in their international suites, showing that tradition and innovation can coexist effortlessly.

# What Role Do Hospitality Furniture Suppliers Play in Bringing This Craft to the World?

Behind every stunning *mother of pearl table* in a luxury hotel or private villa lies a network of artisans, designers, and *hospitality furniture suppliers* who ensure the legacy continues. These suppliers - from *hotel furniture manufacturers* in the UAE to *custom design studios* in the US - serve as bridges between craftsmanship and global demand.

They source pieces from skilled workshops in Damascus, Jaipur, and Seoul, ensuring that each item - whether a *mother of pearl sofa table* or a *pearl inlay dining set* \- meets the highest standards of quality. The best *antique handcrafted hotel furniture suppliers* also work closely with designers to customize sizes, patterns, and finishes that fit both cultural themes and modern interiors.

By promoting these pieces *online*, they‚Äôve made it easier for clients around the world - from resort owners in Miami to villa developers in Doha - to bring this ancient artistry into contemporary spaces.

From the grand hotels of Riyadh to the serene resorts of Muscat, and from penthouse interiors in New York to lakeside retreats in London, *mother of pearl inlay furniture* continues to redefine what luxury truly means: a union of culture, craft, and timeless beauty.

# How to Choose Authentic Mother of Pearl Furniture for Luxury Interiors

Choosing *authentic mother of pearl furniture* is about more than design - it‚Äôs about preserving craftsmanship, history, and value. Whether you‚Äôre a designer curating luxury interiors in Dubai, a homeowner in London, or a collector in Los Angeles, understanding how to identify genuine artistry ensures your investment reflects both beauty and authenticity.

# How Can You Identify Genuine Mother of Pearl Inlay Furniture?

 ‚ÄúAuthentic mother of pearl inlay furniture features hand-cut shell pieces, natural iridescence, and minor asymmetries that reveal skilled human craftsmanship.‚Äù

Genuine *mother of pearl inlay furniture* carries the charm of imperfection - slight irregularities that prove it was made by hand, not machine. The first thing to notice is the inlay pattern. In authentic pieces, the design feels alive: every petal, curve, or mosaic tells its own story. The shell‚Äôs shimmer is never flat - it changes hue under light, from soft ivory to a gentle rainbow.

Avoid items where the surface feels too smooth or uniform; these are often resin imitations. A true *mother of pearl coffee table* or *pearl inlay dresser* has texture and depth - tiny grooves where artisans carefully embedded each shell piece. Handcrafted pieces from Syria, India, or Korea still follow centuries-old methods, ensuring that every *mother of pearl inlay dresser* or *pearl inlay chest of drawers* is one of a kind.

# What Should You Look for in a Mother of Pearl Coffee Table, Dresser, or Sideboard?

Each type of furniture tells a different story. A *mother of pearl coffee table* is often the centerpiece of a living room, so its inlay patterns and base structure matter most. Look for solid wood foundations - teak, rosewood, or walnut - because they provide stability for the delicate inlay work.

For a *mother of pearl dresser* or *sideboard*, focus on craftsmanship around corners and drawers. The joints should be tight, with consistent detailing across the piece. The drawers should glide smoothly, not stick or creak. Even a *mother of pearl nightstand* or *pearl bedside table* should feel sturdy and balanced, reflecting the durability that comes from real craftsmanship.

A growing trend in the UAE and Qatar is blending mother of pearl inlay with modern silhouettes - like round or geometric tables that maintain the cultural essence while fitting into contemporary luxury spaces.

# How Do Material Quality and Inlay Precision Define Authenticity?

Authentic *mother of pearl inlay furniture* stands apart through its tactile beauty. Each shell is hand-cut and polished before being inlaid into the wood. When the light hits a *pearl inlay side table* or *mother of pearl inlay nightstand*, it should create a soft, multi-dimensional glow - not a flat shine.

The material underneath also matters. Genuine pieces use natural wood or occasionally black lacquer bases, seen in *Korean mother of pearl furniture* and *Syrian inlay designs*. These bases enhance contrast and longevity.

Precision is another key marker of quality. In luxury furniture workshops from Jeddah to Jaipur, artisans spend weeks aligning tiny shell fragments into perfect harmony. This patience cannot be replicated by mass production. When you run your hand over a *mother of pearl wardrobe* or *mother of pearl armoire*, it should feel smooth yet detailed - each piece perfectly set, without visible glue or gaps.

# Where Can You Source Trusted Mother of Pearl Furniture Suppliers in the UAE, UK, and USA?

If you‚Äôre sourcing authentic pieces, always look for transparency and provenance. In the UAE, luxury retailers in Dubai and Abu Dhabi partner with *antique handcrafted furniture supplier like Levantiques* who specialize in regional artistry. Many *hospitality furniture suppliers* also collaborate directly with Syrian or Moroccan artisans to create custom designs for high-end hotels and villas.

In the UK and the US, boutiques in London, Los Angeles, and New York often feature curated collections of *mother of pearl inlay furniture online*, offering items like *pearl inlay coffee tables* and *mother of pearl dressing tables* sourced ethically from trusted makers. Whether you‚Äôre buying locally or online, always request details about the materials, handcrafting process, and the artisan community behind your piece.

Authentic *mother of pearl furniture* isn‚Äôt just a d√©cor statement - it‚Äôs a legacy of craftsmanship that bridges cultures and centuries. From *Syrian mother of pearl tables* to *Korean black lacquer cabinets*, every genuine creation is a celebration of patience, artistry, and storytelling. When you choose true handcrafted furniture, you‚Äôre not only bringing home beauty - you‚Äôre keeping an ancient art alive in the modern world.

# Why Does Mother of Pearl Furniture Represent Eternal Luxury and Sustainable Art?

In the ever-changing world of design, few materials have stood the test of time like *mother of pearl furniture*. It reflects not just beauty but also depth - a connection between nature, craftsmanship, and legacy. From the royal palaces of Damascus to the serene villas of Dubai and the artistic homes of Paris, *mother of pearl inlay furniture* continues to define what timeless luxury truly means.

# Why Is Mother of Pearl Furniture Considered the Ultimate Symbol of Timeless Elegance?

 ‚ÄúMother of pearl furniture is timeless because its handcrafted beauty, natural iridescence, and cultural legacy make it a lasting symbol of refined luxury.‚Äù

Every *mother of pearl table*, dresser, or sideboard carries a quiet poetry within its surface - a blend of artistry and natural wonder. The iridescent shimmer of pearl has symbolized purity and prestige for centuries, adorning royal courts and sacred interiors across Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

Unlike fleeting design trends, *mother of pearl inlay furniture* transcends time. Its appeal lies in its ability to balance simplicity with sophistication. A *mother of pearl console table* in a modern Dubai penthouse or a *pearl inlay side table* in a London residence feels equally relevant. The artistry adapts to every era while maintaining its soul - hand-cut shells, intricate motifs, and soft hues that shift with light.

This balance between permanence and delicacy is what makes *mother of pearl furniture* the ultimate symbol of eternal luxury.

# How Does Sustainable Craftsmanship Add Value to Luxury Interiors?

In an age where sustainability defines true luxury, handcrafted *mother of pearl inlay furniture* stands as a responsible art form. Unlike synthetic decor, each creation is made with precision, patience, and respect for natural materials. The shells used - ethically sourced from the sea - are repurposed from nature‚Äôs gifts, not extracted in excess.

Artisans from regions like India, Syria, and Korea continue to craft these masterpieces by hand, preserving traditions passed down through generations. Whether it‚Äôs a *Syrian mother of pearl inlay furniture* piece or a *Korean black lacquer cabinet*, every curve and detail is shaped with minimal machinery, reducing environmental impact.

Luxury hotels in Riyadh and Doha have begun incorporating such sustainable artistry into their interiors - not only for aesthetics but as a statement of ethical design. The fusion of craftsmanship and conscience makes *mother of pearl furniture* more than decor; it becomes a story of mindful living.

# What Does the Future Hold for Mother of Pearl Furniture in Global Design Trends?

The future of *mother of pearl furniture* is bright, grounded in a growing global appreciation for heritage crafts and sustainable luxury. In cities like New York, Dubai, and London, designers are blending traditional inlay techniques with contemporary shapes - think minimalist *mother of pearl coffee tables*, floating *pearl inlay shelves*, or curved *mother of pearl cabinets* that pair beautifully with neutral interiors.

Digital design platforms now connect artisans directly to global buyers, making it easier to source *mother of pearl inlay furniture online* while ensuring fair trade practices. Modern collections often experiment with materials like ebony, rosewood, and ivory inlay, reimagining centuries-old patterns in fresh, architectural forms.

As interior design shifts toward personalization and authenticity, *mother of pearl furniture* stands at the crossroads of luxury and legacy - handcrafted, sustainable, and endlessly adaptable.

# Why Are Collectors and Royal Homes Preserving This Art for Generations?

For collectors and connoisseurs across the United States, Qatar, and the UAE, *mother of pearl furniture* represents an heirloom - not just a furnishing. Royal residences in Riyadh, heritage homes in Istanbul, and private villas in California display *mother of pearl dressers* and *pearl inlay tables* as symbols of lineage and artistry.

Each piece tells a story: of patient hands, of luminous seashells transformed into art, of traditions carried forward. This sense of permanence - the ability to outlast fashion - is why *ivory inlay furniture* and *moroccan mother of pearl furniture* continue to be cherished across generations.

To own an authentic *mother of pearl inlay cabinet* or *mother of pearl armoire* is to hold a piece of history that grows richer with time. It‚Äôs a reminder that luxury isn‚Äôt just about possession - it‚Äôs about preservation.

# Conclusion: The Light That Lasts Forever

In every *mother of pearl furniture* piece, light dances across centuries - from ancient Syrian workshops to modern coastal villas. Its enduring beauty lies in the perfect harmony between art, nature, and human touch. As global design continues to evolve, the world is rediscovering that true luxury isn‚Äôt mass-produced - it‚Äôs handcrafted, ethical, and eternal.

*Mother of pearl inlay furniture* will always remain what it has been for generations - a living art that captures light, heritage, and the soul of timeless design.",1,1759836047.0,u_levantiques,0,1.0,False

Still, we couldn't understand why certain blends received so many repeat purchases, while others received none.

We decided to test feedback. We generated a QR code and placed it directly on the cup. We wrote at the top:

*Rate our coffee and get a discount on the next one*

The QR led to a short mobile form with 2 questions and a field for email. We used the QR code generator **Viralqr**:

1. You can create a dynamic QR code and change the form without reissuing cups
2. There is standard analytics (time of day, device type, city of scanning)
3. A very simple QR code maker. We adjusted the style to match our brand.

And I am confused.

IDK if this is a coffee high. I am really getting good day by day on computer science fundamentals. My next goal is to choose a path. I have two paths:

- Developer

- modern system administration(some call it DevOps)

I have worked in IT as a Technical Support Engineer for 2.5 years. The adrenaline rush of solving a simple but critical issue in production is there. 

I also started homelabbing on the way. It turns out this is not a very engaging and creative profession. Specially given my computer engineering background.

No offense, that is what I feel.

So I am heavily considering switching to Software Development. I have been unintentionally been learning Java(core) since past 1.5 years. Purely for self-fulfillment. 

I am more confident that I can grab a entry level devops role compared to an entry level software developer role. (But the reality is I have not been able to crack not even the former).

What path should I take? 

If I take developer path, it will take me at least a year to be prepared for entry level roles. I am not exactly sure for DevOps path, but it will also take some months less than a year.


In the meantime due to worst private job conditions of Nepal, I am also preparing for loksewa computer engineering since past 4 months.

For ease I'm currently grinding a whole bag of fresh beans from a coffee shop and keeping it in an airtight container, and using it when I need it. 

Currently yielding 36g of coffee in like 18s which is obviously too fast. Maybe its the grinder im using, as the finest setting seems too fine and the pull is super slow and drips, and the next setting up that i'm currently on feels too course (im using a Melitta Molino 1019-01 grinder)

My questions are

Is it better to grind beans when I need it rather than all at once, so I can control the grinder size every time?

Do I need a better grinder?

Is a bottomless filter worth a try? What are the benefits?

I know, I know! And he‚Äôs still quite young too, but there is no denying it.

*I have severe tennis elbow in both arms at the moment, so one of the things that I try to avoid, because it really does hurt, is moving the bin bags through the house to the outside.*

Last week, one very full bag was in the kitchen. As was my husband. The husband moved about, the bag did not. I was not yet worried!
It was a busy week, so a second bag appeared (garbage here is sorted rigorously so things were not smelly, just ‚Äòpresent‚Äô).

There are two doors in the kitchen and both these bags now blocked a door which leads into a little side area. This side area has a toilet. My husband uses the toilet like a lot of guys: like a mini-break with good wifi. He was still using said area. The bags however‚Ä¶ did not move.

Now I did start to worry. These are large objects. I, too, am a large object! If my husband is no longer seeing these, will he stop seeing me? Are large bin/wife shaped blurs appearing in his vision? And is it possible that there are sudden breaks in the condition, where he would then be flooded by a sense of duty and not only put out the bins but also his bin-shaped wife? Only to then sink back into blissful oblivion whilst I head to a landfill?

I h√°d to know. I decided on a test. Two days ago, I left a full, tied shut so ready for moving out, bag directly in front of his blessed coffee machine. It‚Äôs not a hassle, machine is reachable, but there is no way someone n√≥t suffering from BBB would n√≥t consider ‚Äòhuh, this is in a weird spot, lemme move it (to the side, outside, wherever but just m√≥ve it).

It did not move and my dearest remained fully caffeinated. He did not mention it, did not ask - even - if *I * could move it. The bin, it seems, did not exist in his reality.

So, yes‚Ä¶ Bin Bag Blindness. There is no cure bar the dreaded ‚ÄòBin Bag Bed‚Äô but in fairness, he probably would think it‚Äôs just me so why put myself through the hassle of getting it all upstairs and the ensuing elbow agony.

# Full Lesson Transcript Below

**And They Lived Happily Ever After**

*Ruth 4:13-22*

As we come to the end of the book of Ruth, we have uncovered a remarkable love story between a poor widow and a wealthy landowner. I have referred to this book as a fairytale that actually came true.

Now, let‚Äôs watch the last few scenes here, beginning in chapter 4 and verse 13:

*So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the¬†Lord¬†gave her conception, and she bore a son.*

After giving us several chapters on their courtship, in just two sentences here we have a wedding, a home established, and a baby boy delivered.

Now if we could slow it down for just a minute, we know the wedding ceremony would have been a joyful, elaborate event. The entire town of Bethlehem would have been invited. Normally, the celebration would have lasted a week or so, depending on the wealth of the family‚Äîand Boaz was a wealthy landowner.

Now after all of that‚Äîa year or so later‚Äînotice how the focus of the book returns to Naomi:

*Then the women said to Naomi, ‚ÄúBlessed be the¬†Lord, who has not left you this day without a redeemer, and may his name be renowned in Israel!He shall be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age, for your daughter-in-law who loves you, who is more to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.‚Äù*¬†(verses 14-15)

The women are basically telling Naomi, ‚ÄúBecause of Ruth and Boaz and now your grandson, your life has been restored. You have been given fresh enthusiasm and joy in your old age!‚Äù

Just look at Naomi now. Verse 16 says, ‚ÄúThen Naomi took the child and laid him on her lap and became his nurse.‚Äù¬†That word ‚Äúnurse‚Äù refers to a guardian or caregiver. She is his nanny. So, the book of Ruth that opened at the cemetery now concludes in the nursery. And even the neighbors notice that this little boy has put a bounce back in her step and meaning back into her life.

One medical doctor who authored a number of books on the subject of grandparenting wrote that the bond between a child and a grandparent is the least complicated form of human love.\[1\]

I agree. It isn‚Äôt complicated, is it? It‚Äôs all about the relationship. And grandparents don‚Äôt worry about the details either. If the grandkids want to eat dessert first or have another Popsicle, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a verse somewhere to support that!

My grandmother, on my mother‚Äôs side, lived in my hometown of Norfolk, Virginia, where she served as a missionary alongside my parents. Every Friday night, one of us four boys got to have a sleepover at her house. Granny, as we called her, had been widowed for many years and had dedicated the rest of her life to serving as a ‚Äúmissionary mom‚Äù to the servicemen and servicewomen stationed in Norfolk.

Now this once-a-month sleepover at Granny‚Äôs house meant I was going to stay in my pajamas on Saturday morning, watching cartoons and eating my favorite cereal. On top of that, she would let me have a cup of coffee loaded down with sugar and cream. It was dessert in a cup. And that‚Äôs the way I like it to this day.

After breakfast, she would open her well-worn Bible and read some verses and then pray. She prayed around the world‚Äîthey were really long prayers‚Äîand then she would pray for me. I was blessed with that loving, faithful relationship.

If you are a grandparent, you have the ability to impact their grandchildren in so many ways. Take advantage of it.

* You can teach your grandchildren the plan of salvation, like young Timothy learned from his mother¬†*and*grandmother¬†(2 Timothy 1:5).
* You can be a wise counselor with your years of experience and biblical knowledge.
* You can cheer on your grandchildren without having to worry about all the details.

Have you ever thought about the fact that Ruth was a new follower of God who knew little of Jewish customs and biblical traditions in the home? Ruth knew little of the history of Israel and the law of Moses. She barely had time to learn these things before her son would have begun asking questions. Naomi would have been a tremendous resource as a grandmother, working alongside Boaz and Ruth as they raised their son to learn God‚Äôs Word.

We are told¬†here in verse 17 that Boaz and Ruth‚Äôs son grew up to become ‚Äúthe¬†father of Jesse, the father of¬†*David*.‚Äù¬†You know what that means? It means that Ruth, a poor gleaner in the fields of Bethlehem, has joined the family tree, not only of King David, but also of the Descendant of David, our Messiah, the Lord Jesus (see Matthew 1:1-16).

Now as we wrap up the book of Ruth, I want to highlight four similarities between Boaz, Ruth‚Äôs kinsman-redeemer, and Jesus Christ, our Kinsman-Redeemer.

First,¬†*kinship with the bride was required*. In order to meet the conditions of the law and qualify to redeem the bride, the kinsman-redeemer had to be related to the extended family of the bride.

Likewise, the Son of God had to become our relative‚Äîa member of the human race. And the Bible tells us He did: ‚ÄúThe Word became flesh and dwelt among us‚Äù (John 1:14).

Second,¬†*the kinsman-redeemer‚Äôs role was voluntary*. The kinsman could not be forced to perform this role; he had to be willing to redeem the bride. Boaz could have walked away just like that other man did. But he didn‚Äôt, because he loved Ruth.

God the Son became our Kinsman-Redeemer, not because He¬†*had*¬†to, but because He wanted to. First¬†John 4:19 tells us,‚ÄúHe¬†*first*¬†loved us.‚Äù

Third,¬†*the kinsman-redeemer had to be capable of paying the redemption price*. It wasn‚Äôt just about love. No matter how much Boaz loved Ruth, he had to be able to buy Elimelech‚Äôs land; redeeming the bride was costly.

So also, Jesus Christ was able to pay the price for our redemption. The price wasn‚Äôt money but His own lifeblood. The apostle Paul wrote, ‚ÄúIn him we have redemption through his blood‚Äù (Ephesians 1:7).¬†When Jesus hung on the cross and said, ‚ÄúIt is finished‚Äù (John 19:30), that Greek term meant ‚Äúpaid in full.‚Äù All your debt of sin has been completely paid off by Christ.

Finally,¬†*the kinsman-redeemer‚Äôs provision was life-changing*.¬†Think about it: Boaz lifted Ruth out of poverty and even changed her status. She was no longer a Moabite widow but the bride of Boaz.¬†Likewise,¬†Jesus Christ changed your status from lost to saved, from an outcast to a member of His family.

The fairytales I used to read to my daughters when they were little always ended with the words, ‚ÄúAnd they lived happily ever after.‚Äù Those words belong to every member of God‚Äôs family. No matter how difficult, challenging, or painful your life is right now, you¬†*will*¬†live happily ever after.

Then on the last page of those fairytales my girls wanted me to read were those two words: ‚ÄúThe End.‚Äù But let me tell you, beloved, there will be no¬†*end*¬†to your story. You will be taken away one day by your Prince, swept away by your Bridegroom and taken into the presence of your Kinsman-Redeemer. There will never be ‚Äúthe end‚Äù to your ‚Äúhappily ever after.‚Äù It‚Äôs going to last forever.

And with that, our Wisdom Journey through the book of Ruth comes to an end.

Once, I reached out to a director for urgent help on behalf of my team. Instead of solving the issue, he called me into his office for a ‚Äúdiscussion.‚Äù What followed was‚Ä¶ unforgettable.

He leaned back and asked, ‚ÄúDo you know how I see myself in 5‚Äì10 years?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúPlease continue.‚Äù

With a smile, he described his dream daily schedule: wake up, finish breakfast, come to the office, read the newspaper, sip coffee all morning, have lunch, take a nap, return to the office, play computer games, and drink tea until the workday ended.

I was stunned. ‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù was all I could say.

He waved his hand and added, ‚ÄúSo please, don‚Äôt ruin my dream, or my coffee. I know things aren‚Äôt running smoothly, and yes, we might lose some money. But just let it go. Don‚Äôt interfere with how I pursue my dream.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help thinking: 
the STARFISH model of work might be ideal but definitely not like this.

*In business, the STARFISH model means decentralized teams, shared leadership, and the agility to adapt without top-down control.

1o0bje9,https://i.redd.it/o8heh9d78otf1.jpeg,V60 with expert eyes ‚Äî How to raise the extraction without bitterness,"V60 filtering is standard in specialty coffee shops. But the difference between an average cup and an exceptional one is determined by three factors: grind, ratio, and flow. The goal is a balanced extraction of live acids and sweetness, with barely acceptable bitterness. This begins with adjusting the grind to achieve a filter time between 2:15 and 3:00 minutes for most medium-roasted washed beans. A finer grind increases contact area and increases extraction, but risks clogging and bitterness; a coarser grind reduces extraction and results in a ""watery"" cup with a dull flavor.



The common ideal ratio among coffee connoisseurs is 1:15 to 1:16. This starts with 15 grams of coffee to 240‚Äì250 grams of water. Water should be at 92‚Äì96¬∞C, depending on the roasting temperature and freshness of the beans: the lighter the roast and the fresher the coffee, the more heat is used to soften the acidity and bring out the sweetness. The concept of ""multi-pour"" has flourished to achieve a cleaner extraction profile: pour 30‚Äì40 grams of water for 30‚Äì45 seconds, followed by equal pulse pours until the final weight is reached, maintaining a constant water level above the bed and avoiding scratching the filter.



Water chemistry matters: a little hardness is beneficial. The presence of calcium and magnesium cations within a moderate range improves the dissolution of aroma compounds. Completely demineralized water produces a flat cup; excessively hard water increases hardness. If you can't measure minerals, use ""mineral-balanced"" bottled water as a safe measure.



Paper and vortex are crucial. White V60 paper often produces cleaner than brown, but rinse it thoroughly to eliminate the papery taste. Gently rotating the vortex after each pour evens out the bed and prevents channels. Monitor the bed at the end: a flat surface indicates a consistent flow, and a clean conical bottom without heavy mud indicates a proper grind. Record your target extraction weight within 18‚Äì22% as a practical reference through systematic tasting. Ask yourself about the balance of acidity, sweetness, and body after the cup has cooled slightly; errors are more apparent at room temperature.



The bottom line: There's no magic formula. Start with a 1:15.5 ratio, 94¬∞C, 2:40 brewing time, and apply even pulsed pours with gentle rotation. Adjust the grind first, then the temperature, and finally the water ratio. This approach will result in a consistent, quality V60 cup that reflects the character of the brew rather than obscuring it.",1,1759834763.0,u_chemex4coffee,0,1.0,False

So I am a FTM with an 19 month old. One of the things I was looking forward to as a Mum was those cosy days just kids playing, Mums having a coffee in the house. My child has a huge amount of energy like any toddler but at home it's fine and I can sit and monitor much easier.

We have a large house, big play area, big garden we can easily have a party for 50+ people with no issue of space including children. Space and child proofing is not an issue whatsoever. 

I'd always envisioned a nice playdate on a Saturday morning but I also know people know plans on a weekday (I have a day week off) and they just ghost and say nothing. One thing that is making me disheartened, is..nobody wants to come round. EVER. 

I have lots of Mum friends who are always super keen to meet up, coffee, swimming lessons an activity etc etc. They always message me afterwards saying them and child saying they loved meeting and said lets do it again. Always message me to do other things, if I offer to 'just come by', breakfast at home, or afternoon coffee / playdate,..no response. 

Trying to get anyone to make a 'chill plan' is like drawing blood from a stone. This isn't just one person, this is just my whole experience. It just means, my son never just 'plays'. He has no one to 'play' with outside nursery, we HAVE to be out for the morning or all day somewhere to see people.

The only thing is, where I live you do need to drive to (maybe 10-15 mins from anywhere I generally meet people, meaning people have to get in a car to get to me. 

Does a 10 minute drive really put people off that much? How do you invite people? How can I position. Just, chilling? Where am I going wrong?

1o0bhpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1o0bhpu/sf_before_the_gate_of_forever/,[SF] Before the Gate of Forever,"‚ÄúProceed with lifespan renewal?‚Äù

The panel on the wall asked again. The voice was neutral, practiced ‚Äî a woman‚Äôs tone flattened by firmware. I said nothing. White filled the room: white ceiling, white table, white radial chairs. My body, about to receive its 137th renewal, fit the specifications the machine had printed on my file. My name, my ID, my backup log ‚Äî all recorded and immutable.

‚ÄúRefusing renewal is classified as a legally irrational choice,‚Äù the panel continued. ‚ÄúPsychological reintegration therapy is recommended.‚Äù

A news feed scrolled beneath that sentence, windowed into the corner of my vision. The anchor‚Äôs face was composed and small-screen earnest. Headlines traded places with studiocut commentary: *‚ÄúLifespan extension misuse warned,‚Äù ‚ÄúVoluntary deletion framed as mental-health risk.‚Äù* An opinion commentator‚Äôs caption ran in a ticker: *‚ÄúDesire to die is symptomatic ‚Äî treat it.‚Äù*

People believed it. Or perhaps they needed to. The social pact of this age required that life be presumed continual. Death, like fire, had been cordoned off from everyday use.

I remembered a hand ‚Äî small, warm, and insistent. It was Jonah‚Äôs child, forty-eight years ago. We‚Äôd joked, poorly and tenderly, that the baby was an experiment. The word shouldn‚Äôt have fit in a parent‚Äôs arms, but the joke never entirely left us. After the first wave of renewal technology, births slowed to a trickle. Bringing a new life into a world of endless time had become a logistical, ethical, and almost theatrical choice. Children became a kind of risky innovation: resource allocation, social roles, the peculiar inheritance of endlessness.

I once asked aloud, over stale coffee in a rehabilitation clinic‚Äôs group lounge, ‚ÄúDo you have plans for children?‚Äù An awkward silence held the question like a shard. Sarah ‚Äî who always wore her hair in a practical knot and had a kindness that didn‚Äôt pity ‚Äî set down her cup and laughed softly, not cruelly. ‚ÄúWho has children these days?‚Äù she said. There was no malice in it. The question itself was simply obsolete. My face warmed and the room shifted. The moment stayed with me; the awkwardness lodged in my chest like an old coin.

We had not stopped looking outward. Telescopes and launchpads plastered the feeds nightly: the Aurora Corridor‚Äôs new probe on a distant comet, the small festivals at the first ice-moon settlements, a private company‚Äôs banner flashing across Mars‚Äô new habitat dome. Corporations ‚Äî ‚ÄúFounders,‚Äù ‚ÄúCreators,‚Äù ‚ÄúAstraCorps‚Äù ‚Äî grew fat on upgrades: neural scaffolds, compression of memory, upload services that promised a form of immortality beyond biology. Standing on a quiet street, I would watch the sky and find dots streaking with the fever of human drive. Even when our days felt empty, humanity‚Äôs pioneer impulse burned on. It was both hope and stubbornness: a refusal to stop asking how far we could go.

‚ÄúSome call it progress,‚Äù Jonah grumbled once, handing me a thin pamphlet about orbital habitats. ‚ÄúOthers call it running away.‚Äù Jonah kept his temper in reserve, the way a man keeps a clean set of tools. Mina ‚Äî my oldest love, the one who cried and then tried to fix the world with lists ‚Äî split the difference. She worked on a reclamation array that scrubbed old satellite trails from the ionosphere. She told me, often, that to explore was to leave traces you couldn‚Äôt take back.

The government would not let the Hereafter Circle exist openly. They labeled it a public health anomaly. The press called it fringe, then dangerous. Their leaflets said, *‚ÄúHereafter gatherings pose risk to social cohesion.‚Äù* But rumors are like seeds in fertile soil. In alleys and old stone churches, in the shadow of a city that glowed with persistent ads and the distant lights of launch complexes, people began to talk in low voices about departure as a moral choice rather than a crime.

I was not immune to the words. Jonah begged me not to. ‚ÄúEvan, get the therapy,‚Äù he said, palms out. Mina wept when I told her I intended to go. My son, Theo, called once and then stopped answering for a week. ‚ÄúDad, that‚Äôs‚Äî‚Äù was all he could say at first. He represented the new generation: clean, efficient in thought, uninterested in reproduction and suspicious of finality.

The Hereafter Circle‚Äôs meeting place surprised me. On the outside, it was nothing like a data temple. It had been a chapel once, centuries ago, with stone walls and narrow windows. Inside there was a choir, not a synthesized hymn but human voices with all their ragged edges. No screens. A wooden lectern. We sat along pews, passing a paper slate among us. One by one we wrote names; one by one the names were scanned and then, by quiet agreement, struck from systems.

If the state called it deletion, we called it reconciliation.

On the night I chose, rain polished the pavement outside to a mirror. My hands ‚Äî hands that had known the precise feel of a calibration wrench and the roughness of a child‚Äôs clasp ‚Äî trembled only a little. The device they placed at my temple was younger than my oldest regret. Cold kissed my skin; a warmth spread behind my eyes like the first fold of sleep.

The panel had asked me one last time: ‚ÄúProceed with lifespan renewal?‚Äù

I said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Time did odd things as the apparatus unthreaded me. Memory frayed at the edges and then smoothed as if ironed. Jonah‚Äôs face at my bedside was suddenly both older and boyish. Mina‚Äôs fingers were in my hair, an old instinct. Theo‚Äôs voice ‚Äî thin over a network line ‚Äî sounded very far away. The news feed‚Äôs final echo I heard in a fragment: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve mastered time, but perhaps lost the question it answers.‚Äù

Then a white that was neither blinding nor clinical. I remembered the child Jonah had once offered me to hold, the smell of milk and soap, and for a moment I was there again, not as an observer but as someone carrying weight.

When vision returned, I stood beside a river I did not recognize. Morning leaned low, the light mild and uninsistent. On the far bank a woman walked toward me. She was the woman who had sat beside me in the chapel ‚Äî the one who‚Äôd whispered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared, and yet‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a kind of ease.‚Äù Up close her face held every line of a life lived and unmade; it didn‚Äôt matter. She raised a hand.

The grass under my shoes felt real in a way perfumes of server rooms never had. The air carried the ordinary scents of rain, old bread, and distant smoke. Somewhere a child laughed, a sound that might have been recorded or born anew.

‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù she said. Her voice hinted at warmth and an echo, as if it knew my name and had always known it.

I walked. The place was familiar and not. Faces passed that tugged at memory like the edges of a map. A man hummed a song my mother used to hum when she folded laundry. Someone else tucked a scrap of paper into a pocket that smelled like a workshop. It felt less like heaven in the glossy brochure and more like the slow sorting of a house after a long absence: items laid out, reasons for keeping or letting go questioned in silence.

Beyond me, the city I had left glowed faint and far ‚Äî a lattice of launchpads, billboards, and data towers. Above that, a wandering spark traced a rocket‚Äôs arc. People still reached for other worlds. The pioneer impulse was visible even from here; its lights were not a reproach so much as a companion.

The woman who had greeted me fell into step at my side. ‚ÄúFor some,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthis is a beginning. For others, it‚Äôs an end.‚Äù She did not elaborate. She did not need to.

I did not answer. My throat felt raw in an old, honest way I had not allowed it to be for decades.

We walked along the river and the city‚Äôs distant hum shrank. There was no proclamation of truth, no tidy explanation slid into place. The space between things remained ‚Äî full and empty at once. I held that quiet like a fragile pocket of something I was not yet ready to name.

We kept walking.",1,1759834607.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

1o0bdji,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFriendsFriendsClub/comments/1o0bdji/how_i_built_a_fitness_routine_around_my/,How I built a fitness routine around my depression (realistic expectations),"So this one's pretty personal, but I wanted to share what's actually worked for me in terms of staying somewhat active while dealing with depression. 

Not the ""exercise cured my depression!"" bullshit you see everywhere, but the real, messy, imperfect reality of trying to take care of your body when your brain is actively working against you.

I've been dealing with depression on and off for years, and for the longest time, fitness advice felt like it was written by people who've never experienced the specific exhaustion that comes with mental illness. ""Just go for a run!"" Yeah, thanks, Karen. Let me just manifest the energy to put on shoes when getting out of bed feels like climbing Mount Everest.

But I've figured out some strategies that actually work with depression instead of pretending it doesn't exist. Fair warning: this isn't inspirational. It's just practical.

**The Reality Check Nobody Talks About**

**Depression vs. ""Normal"" Tiredness**

Let's be clear about what we're dealing with here. Depression fatigue isn't ""I stayed up too late"" tired. It's ""my limbs feel like they're made of concrete and my brain is wrapped in cotton"" tired. It's physical and mental exhaustion that sleep doesn't fix.

When fitness people say ""you'll feel better after you exercise,"" they're not wrong, but they're also not acknowledging that the gap between feeling terrible and actually starting to exercise can feel impossible to bridge.

**The Motivation Myth (Again)**

Traditional fitness advice assumes you have a baseline level of motivation and energy to work with. When you're depressed, that baseline is often zero or negative. Waiting for motivation to exercise when you're depressed is like waiting for sunshine during a blizzard - technically possible, but not a reliable strategy.

**Building a Depression-Proof Fitness System**

**The ""Bare Minimum"" Philosophy**

My entire approach is built around the smallest possible actions that still count as movement. On good days, I can do more. On bad days, I stick to the bare minimum. The key is that the bare minimum is so low it's almost impossible to fail at.

My absolute minimum is: put on shoes and step outside my front door. That's it. If that's all I can manage, I call it a win and go back inside. But usually, once I'm outside with shoes on, I end up walking to the end of the block at least.

**The ""Depression Day"" vs. ""Regular Day"" Split**

I have two completely different fitness routines:

**Regular Day Routine:** 30-45 minutes of actual exercise - gym, longer walks, bodyweight workouts, whatever feels manageable.

**Depression Day Routine:** 5-10 minutes of gentle movement - stretching in bed, walking to the mailbox, dancing to one song, or just standing outside for a few minutes.

Having separate expectations prevents me from feeling like a failure when I can't do ""normal"" workouts during rough patches.

**Tactical Strategies for Movement When Everything Sucks**

**1\. The ""Piggyback"" Method**

I attach tiny amounts of movement to things I have to do anyway:

- Walk to the far bathroom instead of the close one
- Do gentle stretches while my coffee brews
- Walk around while talking on the phone
- Take one flight of stairs instead of the elevator

When decision-making feels impossible, piggybacking movement onto necessary activities removes the choice component.

**2\. The ""Lowered Bar"" Approach**

I redefined what counts as exercise to include things that wouldn't normally ""count"":

- Stretching in bed before getting up
- Walking around my apartment while listening to music
- Doing dishes while shifting my weight from foot to foot
- Gentle arm circles while watching TV

The goal is maintaining the habit of moving my body, not meeting some arbitrary fitness standard.

**3\. The ""15-Minute Window"" Strategy**

Depression makes everything feel permanent, but I've learned that my energy levels can change throughout the day in small windows. I check in with myself every few hours: ""Could I do 5 minutes of movement right now?""

Sometimes the answer is no for 12 hours straight. But sometimes there's a tiny window where I feel slightly less terrible, and that's when I strike.

**4\. The ""Pre-Depressed Me"" Prep Work**

When I'm having better days, I set up my environment to help depressed me:

- Leave workout clothes in obvious places
- Keep walking shoes by the door
- Save energizing playlists that are easy to find
- Write simple instructions for myself (""just walk to the corner"")

It's like leaving care packages for my future struggling self.

**What Actually Helps on the Darkest Days**

**Movement as Emotional Regulation**

I stopped thinking of exercise as something to improve my body and started thinking of it as medication for my brain. Even 5 minutes of movement can sometimes shift my emotional state from ""completely stuck"" to ""slightly less stuck.""

It's not dramatic, but even tiny shifts matter when you're in a deep hole.

**Sunshine Exposure Therapy**

This one's backed by actual science - light exposure helps regulate mood and sleep cycles. My bare minimum on bad days is just standing outside for 5 minutes, even if I don't walk anywhere.

Sometimes I just sit on my front steps with coffee. It's not exercise, but it's something, and the light helps more than I expected.

**The ""Gentle Rebellion"" Mindset**

When depression tells me I'm worthless and nothing matters, doing even tiny acts of self-care becomes a form of rebellion. Taking a 10-minute walk isn't just movement - it's me saying ""actually, I do matter"" to my brain's bullshit narrative.

Reframing movement as self-advocacy instead of self-improvement made it feel less overwhelming.

**Managing Expectations and Setbacks**

**The ""Wave"" Approach to Progress**

Depression isn't linear, so fitness progress can't be linear either. Some weeks I'm more active, some weeks I barely move. Instead of seeing this as failure, I think of it like waves - there are natural ups and downs, and that's normal.

I track consistency over longer periods (monthly rather than weekly) to account for the natural fluctuations.

**Giving Myself Permission to Suck**

I had to actively give myself permission to have terrible workouts, skip days without guilt, and prioritize mental health over fitness goals. This counter-intuitive approach actually helped me stay more consistent because I wasn't constantly fighting shame spirals.

**The ""Good Enough"" Standard**

Perfect is the enemy of done, especially with depression. A 5-minute walk is infinitely better than a 60-minute workout that only exists in my imagination. I celebrate the small wins instead of focusing on what I didn't do.

**What Doesn't Work (Learned the Hard Way)**

**Intensive Workout Plans**

Anything that requires sustained motivation or energy for weeks at a time is setting myself up for failure. Depression brain doesn't do long-term commitments well.

**All-or-Nothing Thinking**

""I'll start working out every day"" inevitably leads to missing one day, feeling like a failure, and giving up entirely. Flexible, forgiving systems work way better than rigid plans.

**Ignoring Mental Health Days**

Pushing through when I really need rest just leads to longer periods of being completely inactive. Learning to recognize when my body and brain need a break actually helped me be more consistent overall.

**The Realistic Timeline**

**Month 1:** Focused just on establishing tiny habits - stepping outside daily, doing 5 minutes of stretching, walking to the mailbox.

**Month 2-3:** Started adding slightly longer activities on good days while maintaining the minimums on bad days.

**Month 4+:** Developed a flexible routine that scales up and down based on my mental health without breaking entirely.

**The Non-Linear Progress:** Some weeks I'm active 5-6 days. Some weeks it's 1-2 days. Over time, the average has gradually increased, but there are still rough patches.

**The Mental Health Benefits (Without Overpromising)**

Exercise didn't cure my depression, but it gave me:

- Slightly better sleep quality
- Small mood improvements on some days
- A sense of accomplishment during dark periods
- Better physical energy to handle daily tasks
- A healthy coping mechanism that doesn't involve screens

It's not a miracle cure, but it's a useful tool in a bigger toolkit of mental health strategies.

**Building Your Own Depression-Friendly Routine**

**Start Embarrassingly Small**

If walking around the block feels too hard, start with walking to your mailbox. If that's too hard, start with stepping outside your door. There's no movement too small to count.

**Focus on Habit, Not Results**

The goal is maintaining the pattern of movement, not achieving fitness milestones. Consistency at a low level beats sporadic intense efforts every time.

**Plan for Bad Days**

Decide in advance what your absolute minimum looks like so you don't have to make decisions when your brain isn't functioning well.

I think we need more honest conversations about what exercise actually looks like when you're struggling, not just success stories.

The Scavengers‚Äô station smelled different that morning ‚Äî warmer, somehow. The usual tang of rust, oil, and burnt circuits had thinned into something gentler: soap, damp linen, and the faint sweetness of copper in the steam. Someone had fixed the leaking pipes upstairs, but the heat had condensed into fog that rolled lazily along the ceilings. It made the lights shimmer, like breath against glass.

Alvelyn stood before the washroom‚Äôs cracked mirror, one hand brushing a streak of white hair from her cheek. The reflection wavered with the mist, splitting her in two for a heartbeat ‚Äî one solid, one a ghost. She tilted her head, amused by the thought, before her gaze drifted to the bench behind her.

A folded uniform lay waiting. Dark canvas, reinforced at the joints, the sleeves a little too long for her arms. A small note sat on top, written in sharp, hurried ink that had bled slightly into the paper:

*‚ÄúDorsaint ‚Äî for the mansion job. Don‚Äôt ruin it. ‚Äì V.‚Äù*

A grin tugged at her mouth. *Don‚Äôt ruin it*, they said, as though she‚Äôd ever found a door that stayed closed once she touched it.

The uniform was stiff, smelling faintly of ironed cloth and storage dust. She slipped into it anyway, the fabric rasping against her skin as it settled into place. The belt hung a little loose on her hips, but when she clipped her keyring to it, the faint metallic chime felt reassuring ‚Äî like her own pulse reminding her she was still real.

Outside the washroom, the main hall was a hive of motion. The Scavengers worked like clockwork machinery, but noisier ‚Äî laughter mixing with the clatter of crates, boots stomping across the metal floor, the hiss of kettle steam. Someone had dragged in a radio, playing a scratchy melody that barely kept up with the rhythm of conversation.

Alvelyn lingered near the doorway for a moment, invisible in the din. Then heads began to turn ‚Äî one, then two, then a few more ‚Äî until she caught the ripple of recognition in their glances. No hostility this time. Just curiosity, maybe the faintest thread of amusement.

‚ÄúMorning, Dorsaint!‚Äù

The greeting came from a broad-shouldered woman leaning over a crate, grease staining the cuffs of her sleeves. **Marra.** Her short hair was half slicked back with oil, half rebellion, and the corner of her mouth curled in a grin that spoke of both authority and mischief.

Marra tossed a small pouch toward Alvelyn with unceremonious precision. It landed in her palm with a soft clink of metal.

‚ÄúField kit,‚Äù Marra said, wiping her hands on a rag. ‚ÄúCrowbar, lock picks, chalk, ration tabs, the usual things to get you into trouble. No guns yet. Don‚Äôt look at me like that ‚Äî rules are rules.‚Äù

Alvelyn turned the pouch over in her hands, feeling the weight of its contents. ‚ÄúI prefer keys anyway,‚Äù she said, tone mild, eyes glinting.

Marra barked out a laugh. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôve heard. Half the lower corridors are still whispering about your last job.‚Äù

That drew a few chuckles from nearby. Someone at a table raised their mug in mock salute. Alvelyn dipped her head in return, her smile crooked and sharp ‚Äî the kind that could be friendly or dangerous depending on who was watching.

At a nearby workstation, two other Scavengers were hunched over a stack of papers. **Tib**, a wiry young man with wild curls and goggles perpetually perched in them, was tapping a pencil against his teeth as he read. Beside him, **Fenn**, quiet and thin with ink stains climbing his gloves, adjusted his spectacles. Between them lay a letter sealed with red wax, its edges worn from being passed around too often.

Marra gestured toward them. ‚ÄúYour partners today. Don‚Äôt let them bore you to death.‚Äù

Alvelyn stepped closer, curiosity sharpening her features. The letter‚Äôs ink had smudged slightly, but the words remained legible:

**Recipient:** Scavengers‚Äô Association  
**Subject:** Suspicious shipment of books ‚Äî request for investigation.  
**Location:** Caelastria Upper District, House of Karras.

Her brow arched. ‚ÄúBooks?‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúYour tip-offs are usually about broken machines or missing crates, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

Tib looked up from the papers, eyes bright behind his lenses. ‚ÄúSupposedly, the mansion‚Äôs been ordering massive shipments of books. All blank. Hundreds of them. Our supplier says they‚Äôre printed in the lower factories, but the ink‚Äôs gone by the time they reach here. Someone‚Äôs paying a fortune for empty pages.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmpty,‚Äù Alvelyn repeated softly, rolling the word on her tongue. Her fingers brushed the keys at her belt, the soft chime punctuating her thought. ‚ÄúEmpty things still hold stories. You just have to listen long enough.‚Äù

Fenn glanced at her, one brow raised but not unkind. ‚ÄúYou talk like the books can hear you.‚Äù

Alvelyn‚Äôs lips curved. ‚ÄúMaybe they can.‚Äù

Marra groaned good-naturedly, cutting in. ‚ÄúRight, poet. Grab your pack ‚Äî we‚Äôre heading out before the upper district guards start asking questions again. We‚Äôll check the mansion‚Äôs side entrance first. Fenn already sent notice we‚Äôre inspecting delivery irregularities.‚Äù She jabbed a finger toward Alvelyn. ‚ÄúAnd try not to‚Ä¶ make any of the doors nervous this time.‚Äù

Alvelyn blinked, feigning innocence. ‚ÄúDo I do that?‚Äù

Marra shot her a flat look, though her smile tugged at the corners again. ‚ÄúYou hum at them like they‚Äôre old friends. It freaks people out.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs just how doors and I talk,‚Äù Alvelyn replied, tilting her head, the faintest glimmer of amusement in her tone.

Tib snorted, slinging his satchel over his shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a strange one, Dorsaint. But hey ‚Äî the strange ones survive the longest around here.‚Äù

Alvelyn gave a soft laugh that didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes. ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll make myself at home.‚Äù

Marra slapped her shoulder, the gesture heavy but warm. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit.‚Äù

And with that, the Scavengers filed out ‚Äî their boots echoing through the corridor like a procession of hinges turning. Alvelyn followed last, her hand brushing the frame of the doorway as she passed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she whispered to the door, voice too soft for anyone to hear. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come back.‚Äù

It answered her with a faint, metallic sigh ‚Äî the sound of something waking.

**‚Äî**

The **House of Karras** loomed at the far end of the Upper District‚Äôs slope ‚Äî a skeleton of former grandeur draped in dust and ivy. Its fa√ßade was cracked marble, the kind that once gleamed when the Ark‚Äôs light still reached this part of the City. Now it sagged at the edges, as though the weight of its own history had become unbearable. The air carried that peculiar stillness that belonged only to forgotten houses ‚Äî a silence thick enough to muffle even the wind.

The courtyard gates had been chained long ago, the iron corroded into an uneven braid of rust and ivy. The vines crawled through the links like veins, alive with tiny pale blossoms that glowed faintly in the half-light. Someone had repainted the nameplate once, but the paint had bubbled and peeled away, leaving behind only faint ghost-letters: **KARRAS** ‚Äî or maybe **CARCAS**, depending on how the light caught it.

The Scavengers approached quietly, their boots whispering against the cracked stones. Marra walked ahead with her usual certainty, broad shoulders squared, a folded permit in one hand. Tib followed, balancing a satchel of documents and tapping his pen against the clasp ‚Äî a nervous tic. Fenn lingered behind him, silent, expression unreadable behind the dull gleam of his spectacles.

Alvelyn, of course, trailed last. Her steps were soundless. One hand drifted along the iron fence as they passed, fingertips tracing the rust like braille. The metal vibrated faintly under her touch ‚Äî not from wind or movement, but something subtler, deeper. It felt like a whisper caught between teeth. She smiled faintly, though the others didn‚Äôt notice.

When they reached the servants‚Äô entrance, the air changed. It was cooler, heavy with the smell of ink, mildew, and the faint sweetness of rotting glue. The door was half-rotten, its hinges rusted white, but it opened easily when Marra pressed the latch. That, more than anything, unsettled Alvelyn.

Inside, the house was a mausoleum of paper.

Stacks of boxes filled the hall from floor to ceiling, arranged in careful, claustrophobic rows. Each crate bore the mark of a **printing press** from the lower sectors ‚Äî letters pressed into wax, symbols of supply routes and inspection dates. Yet every box they pried open contained the same thing: **Books. Thousands of them.**

Each pristine.Each untouched.Each completely, impossibly blank.

The smell was overwhelming ‚Äî raw paper and old glue, the scent of memory before it‚Äôs written. Dust swirled lazily in the lamplight, settling like ash on their shoulders.

Alvelyn crouched by the nearest crate, brushing her thumb along the smooth edge of a cover. The page caught the light for a heartbeat ‚Äî soft, shimmering, like breath caught in a mirror.

‚ÄúThey hum,‚Äù she murmured.

Marra, kneeling beside another box, glanced over her shoulder. ‚ÄúThey what?‚Äù

Alvelyn tilted her head slightly, the corner of her mouth curling in thought. ‚ÄúListen.‚Äù

The room held its breath. For a moment, the only sound was the slow drip of water somewhere beyond the walls. Then, if one strained ‚Äî if one *really* listened ‚Äî there it was: a faint rhythm, so soft it could almost be imagined. Like something breathing behind the paper.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ inside them,‚Äù Alvelyn said quietly. Her voice softened, reverent but uneasy. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs trying to get out.‚Äù

Tib gave a nervous laugh, running a hand through his curls. ‚ÄúYou always talk like that, or is this just part of your charm?‚Äù

She turned her gaze toward him, her expression unreadable ‚Äî eyes glinting the color of cold iron under candlelight. ‚ÄúDoors talk. So do books. They‚Äôre both meant to be opened.‚Äù

He blinked. ‚Äú...Right.‚Äù

Marra blew out a breath through her nose, half amusement, half exasperation. ‚ÄúSave the poetry for later, Dorsaint. Fenn, with her. Check the ledgers and the shipment tags. Tib, you‚Äôre with me ‚Äî we‚Äôll see if upstairs has more crates.‚Äù

As the others dispersed, Alvelyn lingered beside the crate, her gloved fingers tracing the spines of the blank volumes like a prayer. Every book felt the same ‚Äî too light, too clean. Their bindings whispered faintly beneath her touch, a symphony of hollow promises.

When she cracked one open, the pages shivered. For an instant, a faint outline bled into the paper ‚Äî a shape, a line, a word half-born ‚Äî and then it was gone, fading like breath on glass.

Her heart skipped.

Fenn looked up from the desk in the corner, where a stack of shipping manifests lay spread out. ‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù

She smiled over her shoulder, the expression thin and deliberate. ‚ÄúJust thinking. Maybe these books already have stories. They just haven‚Äôt decided if they want to tell them.‚Äù

Fenn shook his head with a quiet sigh, muttering something about ‚ÄúScavengers and their strays,‚Äù before returning to his paperwork.

Alvelyn closed the book gently, setting it back in its crate. Her fingers lingered on the cover, and under her breath ‚Äî low enough that no one could hear ‚Äî she whispered,

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll listen for you.‚Äù

The paper seemed to rustle in reply, just once, like a door breathing in its sleep.

**‚Äî**

When they split, Alvelyn lingered at the edge of the parlor. The air here was heavier, as if the house itself had swallowed one breath too many and forgotten how to let it go. Dust motes drifted through the amber light from a cracked window, catching on the edges of the crates like tiny, suspended keys.

The books whispered when she moved past them ‚Äî faint scratching sounds beneath their covers, pages shifting against one another, though no wind stirred them. It was the sound of restless things pretending to sleep.

Fenn stood by a crooked desk near the center of the room, adjusting his gloves with quiet precision. He opened one of the ledgers, the paper crisp and yellowed around the edges, and traced his finger down a column of ink. ‚ÄúHere ‚Äî look at this,‚Äù he muttered, half to himself, half to her. ‚ÄúThe supplier‚Äôs the same one for every shipment, but the delivery address changes each time. Warehouse thirteen, then seven, then this place. Someone‚Äôs hiding inventory behind a false trail.‚Äù

Alvelyn hummed, stepping closer, though her eyes weren‚Äôt on the ledger. They were fixed on a tall wooden cabinet at the far wall. Its varnish had long dulled, and the handles were oxidized to green, but beneath the decay, she could feel the soft, steady vibration of something alive. The cabinet‚Äôs presence pressed faintly against her senses ‚Äî not loud, not dangerous, just‚Ä¶ waiting.

She drifted toward it, skirts whispering against the floorboards. ‚ÄúA door inside a door,‚Äù she said softly, tilting her head. ‚ÄúHow polite.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlvelyn‚Äî‚Äù Fenn began, already sounding weary, but she had already lifted a hand.

Her fingers brushed the wood. The air around her shifted. It wasn‚Äôt a real sound, not one that could be heard ‚Äî it was a pressure, a pulse. The incorporeal frame of the lock shimmered at the edges of her awareness, the faint image of a door overlapping the real one. She whispered to it under her breath, coaxing, tracing the lines of the grain as though reading a secret written in the language of hinges.

The cabinet shivered, and the latch sighed open with the gentleness of something exhaling after a long sleep.

Fenn flinched at the sound. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù

But when the doors swung inward, even he fell silent.

Inside, stacks of blank volumes filled the shelves like bones. They were older than the ones in the hall ‚Äî their bindings cracked, their pages slightly warped. Beneath the books sat a single unmarked parcel, wrapped in oilcloth gone gray from age. It had been tucked deliberately beneath the rest, as though to keep it safe ‚Äî or hidden.

Alvelyn knelt. Dust billowed around her knees as she brushed the parcel clean. The string crumbled when she touched it, and the cloth peeled back in brittle layers to reveal a neat bundle of letters tied together with faded twine.

Each page was covered in cramped handwriting that spiraled tighter and tighter toward the center, the ink dark and clotted, the words bending into shapes that weren‚Äôt quite letters. The longer she looked, the more they seemed to crawl, rearranging themselves at the edge of sight.

Fenn leaned over her shoulder, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúWhat language is that?‚Äù

Alvelyn‚Äôs expression softened into something almost fond, though her voice was quiet ‚Äî cautious. ‚ÄúOne that shouldn‚Äôt be printed.‚Äù

The words lingered between them. She turned a single page, careful not to let her fingers brush the ink, and the faint hum that had been in the room since they entered deepened. It resonated in her ribs, in the floorboards, in the spaces between her teeth.

It wasn‚Äôt the Ark‚Äôs hum this time. It was the house.

Before she could speak again, footsteps echoed from the hall ‚Äî quick, heavy. Marra and Tib returning, their voices cutting through the silence.

‚ÄúFound the press upstairs,‚Äù Marra said, her tone clipped. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs been binding these by hand. The plates are gone ‚Äî scrubbed clean.‚Äù

Tib appeared in the doorway, wiping sweat from his brow with an ink-stained sleeve. ‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs this smell ‚Äî like burnt paper. Like they torched something before they left.‚Äù

Alvelyn rose slowly, the letters dangling loosely from her hand. ‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt making books,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúThey were erasing them.‚Äù

The room went still.

Fenn‚Äôs jaw tightened; Tib‚Äôs nervous tapping stopped. Even Marra, solid as stone, said nothing for a moment. The Ark‚Äôs distant pulse ‚Äî mechanical, steady ‚Äî filled the silence like a second heartbeat.

Finally, Marra stepped forward and took the parcel from Alvelyn, her gaze sharp but approving. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bring these back. Good eye, Dorsaint. You‚Äôll fit right in here after all.‚Äù

Alvelyn smiled ‚Äî a small, strange smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach her eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always liked lost things.‚Äù

‚ÄúFitting,‚Äù Tib muttered, half under his breath.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she said, turning toward the half-open cabinet. ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ lost things like me back.‚Äù

The door of the cabinet trembled faintly, almost as if in agreement.

**‚Äî**

The walk back to the Scavengers‚Äô station wound through the lower arteries of the City ‚Äî narrow passages where the lamps burned low and the pipes sweated like fevered skin. Marra led the way with her usual confident stride, Tib trailed behind muttering about soot on his boots, and Fenn carried the parcel of letters carefully against his chest as if it might bleed ink if jostled too roughly.

Alvelyn followed at the rear, her fingers brushing the walls as they moved. Every seam felt alive tonight. The doors breathed shallowly, the bolts whispered, and the locks clicked faintly, half-asleep. They remembered her touch from before.

‚ÄúYou really have to *touch everything*, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Tib asked at one point, glancing back at her.

Alvelyn smiled, slow and unbothered. ‚ÄúThey get lonely when ignored.‚Äù

Marra snorted, shaking her head. ‚ÄúCareful, Tib. Next thing you know, she‚Äôll start naming the hinges.‚Äù

‚ÄúI already have,‚Äù Alvelyn said lightly.

The laughter that followed echoed strangely in the tunnel ‚Äî brief, but real. For the first time since she‚Äôd joined the Scavengers, the sound didn‚Äôt feel like it came from behind a door she wasn‚Äôt allowed to open.

By the time they reached the station, the hour-lamps had dimmed to red. The great steel shutters at the entrance loomed above them like ribs. Marra unlocked them with a practiced twist of her wrist, and the hinges groaned awake in greeting. Inside, the station‚Äôs hall glowed with the amber light of low-burning braziers and the faint hum of dormant machinery.

Someone had left coffee steaming on the side table, and a battered gramophone in the corner croaked out a tune that had long forgotten its own melody. The air smelled of oil and paper, with a faint sweetness of burning dust.

They filed into the **archives** ‚Äî a narrow chamber lined with shelves of tagged relics and ledgers. The walls sweated faint heat from the furnace room below, and the brazier near the desk hissed like a patient animal.

Marra dropped the parcel onto the table with a thud, the string slipping loose. Fenn began cataloging the find, his ink pen scratching quickly across the forms. Tib sank into a chair, rubbing his hands over the brazier, muttering about ghosts in old houses.

Alvelyn stood apart for a moment, watching the flame. It licked at the air, restless, like a door trying to breathe.

‚ÄúSit,‚Äù Marra said finally, pulling open a tin from the supply crate. Steam curled out, carrying the sharp scent of broth and grain. She tossed it to Alvelyn. ‚ÄúEat. You did well.‚Äù

Alvelyn blinked, startled, catching it against her palms. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre feeding me?‚Äù

Marra smirked, leaning back against the desk. ‚ÄúYou look like you forget to. Besides, doors don‚Äôt open well when they‚Äôre starving.‚Äù

That earned a few laughs ‚Äî real ones this time. Even Fenn, quiet and watchful, cracked a smile behind his glove. Tib raised his mug in mock salute. ‚ÄúTo the weirdest lockpick in the City.‚Äù

Alvelyn tilted her head, eyes bright with something unreadable. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very rude,‚Äù she said with mock offense. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a lockpick. I‚Äôm what happens *after* the lock.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, sure,‚Äù Tib said, chuckling. ‚ÄúWhatever you say.‚Äù

She sat beside them, pried open the tin, and ate slowly. The food was plain, but warm, and the warmth crept through her ribs like light through a crack in a wall. She wasn‚Äôt used to this kind of noise ‚Äî the idle chatter, the shuffling of boots, the clinking of tools being put away. It filled the room in a way that made her chest feel oddly heavy, like a pressure building behind a familiar door she didn‚Äôt yet know how to open.

Marra passed by and dropped a folded piece of cloth on the table ‚Äî a repair patch for her uniform, clean and neatly stitched. ‚ÄúNext time you crawl through a haunted cabinet, try not to rip your sleeve,‚Äù she said.

Alvelyn blinked, then smiled faintly. ‚ÄúYou patch doors, too, or just people?‚Äù

‚ÄúOnly the ones that squeak too loud,‚Äù Marra said without missing a beat, and Tib laughed so hard he nearly spilled his coffee.

The noise died down eventually. The brazier‚Äôs flame settled into a steady rhythm, its crackle matching the pulse of the Ark somewhere deep beneath the floors. Fenn finished writing the report and passed it to Marra for her signature.

Alvelyn watched all this quietly, eyes half-lidded, spoon still in hand. The warmth spread slower now, deliberate, seeping into the spaces she usually kept locked tight. She glanced toward the corridor ‚Äî toward the simple, dented door that led back to her dormitory.

The lamp above it flickered once.

‚ÄúA new threshold,‚Äù she murmured under her breath.

Then she smiled ‚Äî a quiet, secret thing ‚Äî and stood, tucking the empty tin under her arm.

As she left the archive, the hinges on the door gave a soft sigh, and the whisper that followed was one only she could hear.

In just one simple bowl, we can be instantly transported back to the 19th and early 20th century, onto the cattle trails of the American West (such as the Chisholm Trail and the Goodnight-Loving Trail) with a bunch of hungry cowboys who‚Äôve been working all day long tending cattle. 

Kent Rollins is a popular celebrity chef and YouTube personality who has made his living feeding ranch hands on cattle ranches throughout the country and educating the public about the history of ranching and the legacy of chuckwagon cooks. He regularly cooks outdoors, in the elements, at his own chuckwagon kitchen, using his famous portable camp oven ‚ÄúBig Bertha,‚Äù and plenty of cast iron cookware, just like it was done 150 years ago. But he also adapts his recipes for the standard indoor home kitchen as well. 

Through his cooking and his related efforts, he keeps alive the spirit of the Old West!

These recipes, for sourdough biscuits and the sourdough starter that‚Äôs used to make them, are from his first cookbook, *A Taste of Cowboy: Ranch Recipes and Tales from the Trail* (2015) which Kent wrote with his wife, Shannon Keller Rollins.

#Cowboy Kent Rollins‚Äô Sourdough Biscuits

Prep Time: 15¬†minutes

Total Time: 1 hour and 40¬†minutes

Makes about 16 biscuits

*Sourdough was a staple in old cow camps because milk and buttermilk were hard to come by on the trail. Along with beans and coffee, biscuits were about all a cowboy was going to get. This started out as Grandma‚Äôs recipe that I tweaked so they turn out light and fluffy. The biscuits have a sweeter and softer sourdough flavor than traditional San Francisco sourdough. Be sure not to overwork the dough. Like I always say, the only time I ‚Äúknead‚Äù biscuit dough is when I‚Äôm broke!*

1 (¬º-ounce) package rapid-rise yeast

3 cups Sourdough Starter (see recipe below*)

4 to 5 tablespoons sugar

‚Öì cup vegetable oil

2¬Ω tablespoons baking powder

2 teaspoons salt

2¬Ω to 3 cups all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons butter, melted


1. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F with a rack in the middle. Butter a 9-x-13-inch baking pan or 12-inch cast iron skillet.

2. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the starter. Whisk in 4 tablespoons of the sugar and let sit for 1 minute.

3. Whisk in the oil, baking powder, and salt. At this point, taste the starter. If it is too tart, add a little more sugar, to taste. Remember, the first time you use the starter, it will be the sourest.

4. Slowly begin stirring in the flour until it makes a soft dough and is no longer sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll out to about ¬Ω inch thick.

5. Cut out about 16 rounds with a biscuit cutter and place on the baking pan or skillet close together.

6. Cover the biscuits with a buttered piece of wax paper and let rise in a warm place for 40¬†minutes to 1 hour, or until nearly doubled in size.

7. Uncover the biscuits and bake for 20 to 25¬†minutes, or until golden brown. Brush with melted butter and serve warm.


#Sourdough Starter*

Prep Time: 5¬†minutes

Total Time: 12 hours and 5¬†minutes

Makes 8 cups

*Sourdough is like my old hat; it has many uses and fits in a lot of different situations, from biscuits to piecrusts to battering meat. You can even substitute it in any recipe that calls for milk or buttermilk. This sourdough is a tad sweeter and a whole lot easier to keep than most. Traditional sourdoughs are like needy horses. You have to feed them, read them a bedtime story every night, and feed them again. But you won‚Äôt have to feed this one constantly, and it‚Äôs ready to go in twelve hours. It was a staple for old Cookie on the trail, and it‚Äôs still used on my wagon today.*

4 cups warm water

1 (¬º-ounce) package rapid-rise yeast

5 tablespoons sugar

4 cups all-purpose flour

1 russet potato, peeled and quartered


1. Add the warm water to a crock jar that holds at least 1¬Ω¬†gallons. This will prevent the starter from frothing over while it‚Äôs setting up.

2. Whisk in the yeast and sugar and let sit for 1 minute.

3. Slowly whisk in the flour. Drop the potato pieces into the bottom of the crock jar. Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter for at least 12 hours, stirring halfway through. You can let the starter sit longer for a more sour flavor.

4. Before using the starter in a recipe, whisk it briskly until smooth.


Tip: The starter will be sourest with its first use, so you may want to add a little more sugar to the first recipe you use it in. I typically keep this starter for a week at a time, stirring at least once a day. However, you can keep it as long  as the potato stays intact. I prefer to use a russet potato because it holds up the best, but you can use any potato you have on hand. Always cover the starter with a towel and never refrigerate it.

# The Helmet

**Classification**:¬†Supernatural Powers, Cosmic-Based Powers, Creation, Reality Manipulation, Chaotic Powers, Conceptual Powers, Reality Manipulation

**Type**: Thought-Based

**Energy Consumption**: None

**Threat Level**: 2

**Summary**:

A rare ability, one day a helmet with the psi symbol appeared in Saiki's room.

Once he put on the helmet, Saiki felt that it contained a great deal of energy, almost comparable to his own. But strangely, the helmet seems to grant him anything he desires.

1,000 coffee jellies? Granted. One day without problems? Granted. No spoilers for a series? Granted.

It seems like the perfect power, or it was, because the helmet broke when he wished to get rid of his powers. In the end, it can't grant everything.

# Trivia

* Saiki regrets not wishing for no more problems in his life.
* The helmet has slowly been repaired over time, and is now almost functional again.
* The helmet only grants Saiki's wishes.

1o0bccr,https://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/1o0bccr/colonization_rebalancing_mod_concept/,Colonization Rebalancing Mod concept,"Pretty much the title, I'm conceptualizing a mod to make colonization more realistic and histofical, and I want some community inputs on how to make it better. I'm not sure if I will be uploading it online since I intend for it to be a personal mod, but I'll see.

Some main features:
- AI will not take Exploration or Expansion for their first idea group. Colonizers will not take a Diplomatic idea group first (so they can take Explo next)

- Reduced settler chance and global settlers for each additional colonist (from Reduced Exponential Colonization mod). 

- +5 goods produced & +3 unrest for all sugar, cocoa, tobacco, and coffee provinces in the Carribean to reflect the major plantations there, debating if I should expand it to other major colonial ports in the New World.

- Trading in Slaves now gives +0.2 global goods produced.

- All ports in India, Southeast Asia, and China gain a province modifier granting +15 trade power if they are owned by a European nation and are not connected to any other provinces owned by that nation (up to 6 trading ports in India and SE Asia, 3 in China). Exception are two neighbouring provinces with CoTs (exempted from the neighbour rule).

- Inland colonization and conquest in Africa is now much harder (almost impossible) by jacking up attrition and significantly reducing settler growth.

- Renaissance and Colonialism spread much faster, but non-Europeans get an institution spread malus that progressively worsens by age until they are no longer able to embrace institutions (starting 1600 for the Nomadic, African, and Native tech groups and 1650/1700 for the Indian, Chinese, Muslim, and Ottoman tech groups). Only way to counteract this is by being a GP with Renaissance, Colonialism, and Printing Press embraced (highly unlikely except for player nations). This makes it more likely for European outposts to not get annexed within a few decades.

1o0basz,https://i.redd.it/ekfhiqpu5otf1.jpeg,"How to make Sourdough Biscuits, just like you would have gotten from the Chuckwagon on the Cattle Trail!","Kent Rollins is a popular celebrity chef and YouTube personality who has made his living feeding ranch hands on cattle ranches throughout the country and educating the public about the history of ranching and the legacy of chuckwagon cooks. He regularly cooks outdoors, in the elements, at his own chuckwagon kitchen, using his famous portable camp oven ‚ÄúBig Bertha,‚Äù and plenty of cast iron cookware, just like it was done 150 years ago. But he also adapts his recipes for the standard indoor home kitchen as well. 

Through his cooking and his related efforts, he keeps alive the spirit of the Old West!

These recipes, for sourdough biscuits and the sourdough starter that‚Äôs used to make them, are from his first cookbook, *A Taste of Cowboy: Ranch Recipes and Tales from the Trail* (2015) which Kent wrote with his wife, Shannon Keller Rollins.


#Cowboy Kent Rollins‚Äô Sourdough Biscuits

Prep Time: 15¬†minutes

Total Time: 1 hour and 40¬†minutes

Makes about 16 biscuits

*Sourdough was a staple in old cow camps because milk and buttermilk were hard to come by on the trail. Along with beans and coffee, biscuits were about all a cowboy was going to get. This started out as Grandma‚Äôs recipe that I tweaked so they turn out light and fluffy. The biscuits have a sweeter and softer sourdough flavor than traditional San Francisco sourdough. Be sure not to overwork the dough. Like I always say, the only time I ‚Äúknead‚Äù biscuit dough is when I‚Äôm broke!*

1 (¬º-ounce) package rapid-rise yeast

3 cups Sourdough Starter (see recipe below*)

4 to 5 tablespoons sugar

‚Öì cup vegetable oil

2¬Ω tablespoons baking powder

2 teaspoons salt

2¬Ω to 3 cups all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons butter, melted


1. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F with a rack in the middle. Butter a 9-x-13-inch baking pan or 12-inch cast iron skillet.

2. In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the starter. Whisk in 4 tablespoons of the sugar and let sit for 1 minute.

3. Whisk in the oil, baking powder, and salt. At this point, taste the starter. If it is too tart, add a little more sugar, to taste. Remember, the first time you use the starter, it will be the sourest.

4. Slowly begin stirring in the flour until it makes a soft dough and is no longer sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and roll out to about ¬Ω inch thick.

5. Cut out about 16 rounds with a biscuit cutter and place on the baking pan or skillet close together.

6. Cover the biscuits with a buttered piece of wax paper and let rise in a warm place for 40¬†minutes to 1 hour, or until nearly doubled in size.

7. Uncover the biscuits and bake for 20 to 25¬†minutes, or until golden brown. Brush with melted butter and serve warm.


#Sourdough Starter*

Prep Time: 5¬†minutes

Total Time: 12 hours and 5¬†minutes

Makes 8 cups

*Sourdough is like my old hat; it has many uses and fits in a lot of different situations, from biscuits to piecrusts to battering meat. You can even substitute it in any recipe that calls for milk or buttermilk. This sourdough is a tad sweeter and a whole lot easier to keep than most. Traditional sourdoughs are like needy horses. You have to feed them, read them a bedtime story every night, and feed them again. But you won‚Äôt have to feed this one constantly, and it‚Äôs ready to go in twelve hours. It was a staple for old Cookie on the trail, and it‚Äôs still used on my wagon today.*

4 cups warm water

1 (¬º-ounce) package rapid-rise yeast

5 tablespoons sugar

4 cups all-purpose flour

1 russet potato, peeled and quartered


1. Add the warm water to a crock jar that holds at least 1¬Ω¬†gallons. This will prevent the starter from frothing over while it‚Äôs setting up.

2. Whisk in the yeast and sugar and let sit for 1 minute.

3. Slowly whisk in the flour. Drop the potato pieces into the bottom of the crock jar. Cover with a tea towel and let sit on the counter for at least 12 hours, stirring halfway through. You can let the starter sit longer for a more sour flavor.

4. Before using the starter in a recipe, whisk it briskly until smooth.


Tip: The starter will be sourest with its first use, so you may want to add a little more sugar to the first recipe you use it in. I typically keep this starter for a week at a time, stirring at least once a day. However, you can keep it as long  as the potato stays intact. I prefer to use a russet potato because it holds up the best, but you can use any potato you have on hand. Always cover the starter with a towel and never refrigerate it.

It‚Äôs chipped now, and every time I pour coffee, it spills a little on the counter.
Maybe I‚Äôm doing it wrong.
Or maybe the mug itself refuses to hold anything warm anymore.

My friends have seen it. They ask where I got it from. And I tell them I don‚Äôt remember.
They smile, thinking I‚Äôm hiding something. And they‚Äôre right, in a way. Because I am.

It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want them to have a mug like this. I just don‚Äôt want them to have what came with it, the short-lived magic.
The kind that makes you feel like a queen for a while and then leaves you to rebuild the throne alone.

Sometimes I still imagine you here, in the kitchen. You‚Äôd laugh at me for keeping a broken cup. You‚Äôd take it from my hands, fix it your way, and pour the coffee just right.
You always knew how much milk I liked,
how long I‚Äôd wait before that first sip.
Funny how the small things hurt more than the big ones.

Your mom drops by often. She looks at me the way only mothers can ‚Äîhalf love, half worry.
She says I should get remarried, that I still have a lifetime ahead of me. And I nod.
But inside, it burns.
Not because she‚Äôs wrong, but because she doesn‚Äôt understand.
How do I start over when the air still smells like you?
How do I tell someone new my favorite song
when every lyric still belongs to you?

I don‚Äôt want to share my little wins,
or my bad days, or the way I hum when I cook.
Those things are yours.
They were built around your presence.

At night, when sleep won‚Äôt come,
I close my eyes and pretend you‚Äôre here ‚Äî
that gentle hum you used to make, the way you‚Äôd pull me close, whispering something that never quite made sense but always calmed me down. And somehow, I fall asleep.

Your things are still here ‚Äîyour jacket, your books, that single sock that never had a pair.
The air in this house still carries your scent,
and I like to believe you‚Äôre not gone,
just misplaced for a while.

Your favorite shirt from that morning
still hangs by the door,
creased from the last time you touched it.
It was raining, remember?
You said you‚Äôd be back early.
The sound of tires on wet road
still echoes somewhere in my head.

Your broken glasses sit on the shelf,
my picture still tucked in your wallet,
your watch still ticks faintly by the bedside,
counting hours that no longer include you.

Your work desk waits,
frozen in the middle of a day
you never got to finish.

I never moved your chair, the one that still faces the window as if one day you‚Äôll walk through that door again, smile at the mess I‚Äôve made, and ask if I ever learned how to pour coffee without spilling.

Until then,
the mug stays on the counter,
cracked, stubborn, and loved.
Just like me.

At¬†least¬†let¬†me¬†drive¬†you¬†to¬†the¬†bridal¬†shop¬†you¬†mentioned¬†to¬†me¬†last¬†night,‚Äù¬†Adrian said,¬†his¬†voice¬†soft¬†as¬†he¬†stroked¬†her¬†hair.¬†‚ÄúYou¬†said¬†you¬†wanted¬†to¬†pick¬†out¬†your¬†dress.‚Äù¬†

Before¬†Adrian¬†could respond,¬†his¬†phone¬†vibrated¬†on¬†the¬†table¬†and¬†the¬†screen¬†lit¬†up¬†with¬†Miles‚Äò¬†name.¬†Adrian¬†let¬†out¬†a¬†groan¬†while¬†his¬†smile¬†faded¬†as¬†he¬†picked¬†up¬†the¬†phone.¬†

‚ÄúDo¬†you¬†have¬†to¬†ruin¬†my¬†morning¬†already,¬†Miles?‚Äù¬†Adrian¬†grumbled,¬†holding¬†the¬†phone¬†to¬†his¬†ear.¬†

‚ÄúGood¬†morning to¬†you¬†too,¬†sunshine,‚Äù¬†Miles¬†replied,¬†his¬†voice¬†brisk.¬†‚ÄúI¬†need¬†you¬†at¬†AMN,¬†now.‚Äù¬†

Adrian‚Äôs¬†brows¬†furrowed.¬†‚ÄúI¬†just¬†got¬†home¬†last¬†night.¬†Can‚Äôt¬†it¬†wait?¬†I‚Äôm¬†having¬†breakfast¬†with¬†Noelle.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt¬†can‚Äôt¬†wait,‚Äù¬†Miles¬†said¬†firmly.¬†‚ÄúWe¬†just¬†got¬†an¬†offer¬†from¬†Dela¬†Vega¬†Productions.¬†It‚Äôs¬†huge,¬†Adrian!¬†The¬†kind¬†of¬†deal¬†people¬†would¬†kill¬†for.¬†You¬†need¬†to¬†hear¬†this¬†in¬†person.‚Äù¬†

Adrian¬†pinched¬†the¬†bridge¬†of¬†his¬†nose.¬†He¬†glanced¬†at¬†Noelle¬†who¬†was¬†quietly¬†sipping¬†her¬†coffee¬†but¬†watching¬†him¬†with¬†an¬†understanding¬†smile.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†not¬†interested,¬†Miles,‚Äù¬†Adrian¬†said¬†while¬†leaning¬†back¬†in¬†his¬†chair.¬†‚ÄúI¬†told¬†you¬†I¬†want to¬†spend¬†time¬†with¬†Noelle.¬†Whatever¬†it¬†is,¬†we¬†can¬†talk¬†about¬†it¬†tomorrow.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo,¬†we¬†can‚Äôt,‚Äù¬†Miles¬†insisted¬†with¬†an¬†unyielding¬†tone¬†in¬†his¬†voice.¬†‚ÄúThis¬†is¬†a¬†once‚Äìin‚Äìa‚Äìlifetime¬†opportunity.¬†Dela¬†Vega¬†Productions¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†just¬†knock¬†on¬†doors!¬†They¬†only¬†call¬†when¬†they¬†know¬†you‚Äôre¬†the¬†best¬†fit.¬†You‚Äôd¬†be¬†crazy¬†to¬†ignore¬†this.‚Äù¬†

Adrian¬†sighed¬†heavily¬†and¬†ran a¬†hand¬†through¬†his¬†messy¬†hair.¬†He¬†looked¬†at¬†Noelle¬†again,¬†silently¬†apologizing¬†with¬†his¬†eyes.¬†But¬†Noelle¬†only¬†smiled¬†softly¬†while¬†nodding¬†her¬†head¬†in¬†silent¬†encouragement.¬†

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù¬†Adrian¬†finally¬†said¬†but¬†still¬†a¬†little¬†reluctant.¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll¬†be¬†there¬†in¬†an¬†hour.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMake¬†it¬†half,‚Äù¬†Miles¬†quipped¬†before¬†hanging¬†up.¬†

Adrian¬†sighed,¬†standing¬†up¬†and¬†walked¬†around¬†the¬†table¬†to¬†plant¬†a¬†kiss¬†on¬†the¬†top¬†of¬†her¬†head.‚Äù¬†

At¬†least¬†let¬†me¬†drive¬†you¬†to¬†the¬†bridal¬†shop¬†you¬†mentioned¬†to¬†me¬†last¬†night,‚Äù¬†Adrian said,¬†his¬†voice¬†soft¬†as¬†he¬†stroked¬†her¬†hair.¬†‚ÄúYou¬†said¬†you¬†wanted¬†to¬†pick¬†out¬†your¬†dress.‚Äù¬†

Noelle‚Äôs¬†lips¬†curled¬†into¬†a¬†smile¬†as¬†she¬†looked¬†up¬†at¬†him.¬†‚ÄúYou¬†don‚Äôt¬†have¬†to.¬†You‚Äôre¬†already¬†in¬†a¬†rush¬†because¬†of¬†Miles,¬†and¬†I¬†know¬†how¬†much¬†he‚Äôll nag¬†you¬†if¬†you‚Äôre¬†late.‚Äù¬†

Adrian¬†smirked,¬†crouching¬†down¬†beside¬†her¬†chair¬†so¬†their¬†eyes¬†met.¬†‚ÄúI¬†can¬†handle¬†Miles.¬†But¬†you?¬†You‚Äôre¬†my¬†priority.‚Äù¬†

Her¬†heart¬†softened¬†at¬†his¬†words,¬†but¬†she¬†still¬†shook¬†her¬†head¬†gently.¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôll¬†be¬†fine.¬†Grace¬†is¬†meeting¬†me¬†there,¬†remember?¬†You¬†focus¬†on¬†this¬†big¬†project.¬†We‚Äôll have¬†plenty¬†of¬†time later¬†to¬†argue¬†over¬†lace¬†and¬†tulle.‚Äù¬†

With¬†one¬†last¬†lingering¬†glance,¬†Adrian¬†left¬†as¬†the¬†sound¬†of¬†the¬†door¬†clicking¬†shut¬†echoed¬†through¬†the¬†house.¬†Noelle¬†exhaled¬†deeply¬†while¬†her¬†fingers¬†brushed¬†against¬†her lips¬†where¬†his¬†kiss¬†lingered,¬†before¬†finishing¬†her¬†coffee.¬†

Grace¬†stood¬†outside¬†of¬†the¬†bridal¬†shop¬†while¬†keeping¬†her¬†eyes¬†on¬†her¬†watch.¬†The¬†soft¬†clinking¬†of¬†her¬†bracelets¬†echoed¬†faintly¬†as¬†she¬†crossed¬†her¬†arms¬†and¬†tapped¬†her¬†heel against¬†the¬†pavement.¬†

And¬†when¬†she¬†spotted¬†Noelle¬†approaching¬†in¬†her¬†usual¬†shirt¬†and¬†fitted¬†pants,¬†Grace¬†couldn‚Äôt¬†help¬†but¬†let¬†out a¬†light¬†laughter.¬†‚ÄúYou¬†know,¬†you‚Äôre¬†probably the¬†only¬†bride‚Äìto‚Äìbe¬†in¬†the¬†city¬†who¬†shows¬†up¬†to¬†pick¬†a¬†wedding¬†dress¬†looking¬†like¬†she‚Äôs¬†here¬†to¬†run¬†errands.‚Äù¬†

Sounds dreamy, right?

But then reality hits you‚Ä¶ What now? ü§î It‚Äôs like hopping off a roller coaster and standing in the exit line, wondering if you should go back for another ride or just enjoy the view. 

Here‚Äôs the thing: **Early retirement** isn‚Äôt just about kicking back and binge-watching the latest series. It‚Äôs about figuring out what *truly matters* to you now. So, let‚Äôs dive into balancing purpose and paycheck‚Äîyes, you can have both!

**First, let‚Äôs explore the purpose side:**  
- **What lights you up?** Is it painting, gardening, volunteering, or maybe starting a blog?  
- **How can you invest your time in what you love?** Even if you don‚Äôt monetize it initially, jump in and enjoy every messy moment.  
- **Network around your passions!** Connecting with like-minded folks can open up new avenues and ideas.

**Now, the paycheck part:**  
- **Can your hobbies turn into income?** Think you can teach art classes or sell your homemade goodies? That craft store you love might just need a new vendor! üé®  
- **Flexibility is key:** Consider gig work or freelancing. You can earn while maintaining your freedom.  
- **Keep learning!** Whether it‚Äôs online courses or workshops, leveling up your skills can unlock unexpected opportunities.

**But here‚Äôs the kicker:** You don‚Äôt have to choose! There‚Äôs a beautiful space where purpose and paycheck coexist. 

Imagine this: a few months into your new lifestyle, and you stumble upon an opportunity with a brand you adore. They might want your story, your unique perspective, or your expertise. Suddenly, you‚Äôre being compensated for what you genuinely love doing. How cool is that?

I mean, we believe in strongest people. üåü Curious about following your passions while maintaining that financial stability? Check this out: [Explore Potential Opportunities Here](https://mavely.app.link/e/TuANm4vQCSb)! (Just a heads up, that link helps us keep the motivation flowing around here. üòä)

Just remember, it‚Äôs perfectly okay to take time to explore your new identity outside of the workplace. It‚Äôs an adventure! And like any good adventure, there might be a few bumps along the road. But hey, that‚Äôs where the best stories come from, right?

ChatGPT should explain math, create scenarios, guide problem-solving, and inspire creativity. No more school answers or brainrot. AI should help humans grow, explore, and solve real-life problems safely.","Hey ChatGPT Team,

I‚Äôm writing because there‚Äôs a huge problem with how people are using ChatGPT, and it‚Äôs starting to make humans dumber instead of smarter. ChatGPT is amazing ‚Äî it can create stories, generate ideas, solve problems, and help people in countless ways. But right now, many are misusing it, and it‚Äôs hurting learning, creativity, and critical thinking.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening and what needs to change:

1. Math Answers Abuse
People are copying direct math answers from ChatGPT for homework, tests, and assignments. This is not learning ‚Äî it‚Äôs cheating. ChatGPT should explain concepts and reasoning instead of giving final answers. Stop making humans lazy with shortcuts.


2. Brainrot Image Generators
AI is being used to create random brainrot, low-quality, or nonsensical images. This floods platforms and reduces creativity instead of enhancing it. ChatGPT should encourage responsible and meaningful image generation.


3. Scenarios and Creative Use
ChatGPT is great for writing scenarios, ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù situations, and imaginative stories. This is where AI truly shines ‚Äî helping humans brainstorm, write, and imagine new ideas safely.


4. Rotting People‚Äôs Brain
Giving direct answers, generating nonsense, and over-reliance on AI is literally making people dumber, reducing problem-solving skills, and killing curiosity.


5. Giving School Answers
AI should never give homework, test, or exam answers. Everyone hates cheating. ChatGPT should encourage learning, not shortcuts.


6. AI Should Make Life Easier, Not Enable Cheating
The main goal of AI is to help humans, not to replace learning or critical thinking.


7. Let AI Be Used for Helping People
ChatGPT should be focused on helpful, safe, and productive guidance ‚Äî teaching concepts, giving tips, and aiding creativity.


8. Helping People Find Places
AI should help with practical life tasks, like:



‚ÄúChatGPT, where is the closest coffee shop near me?‚Äù ‚òï

Navigating new areas üåç

Finding solutions quickly and safely ‚úÖ


9. Helping People Fix Stuff
AI should guide people in fixing everyday things, like:



Cabinets üõ†Ô∏è

Fridges ‚ùÑÔ∏è

Water bottles üíß

Electronics, furniture, and more


10. Helping People Write Stories
ChatGPT should let people create stories, scenarios, and imaginative works, sparking creativity and improving writing skills ‚úçÔ∏è‚ú®



The bottom line: ChatGPT has the potential to make humans smarter, more creative, and more capable, but right now it‚Äôs being misused to cheat, take shortcuts, and rot people‚Äôs brains. Stop giving school answers. Stop promoting brainrot. Let AI teach, guide, inspire, and assist in real-life problem-solving.

Everyone hates cheating. Everyone wants to grow smarter. Let ChatGPT help humans

1o0azwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreCervicalCancer/comments/1o0azwo/my_leep_procedure_hpv_journey_australia/,My LEEP Procedure & HPV Journey (Australia),"
Hey everyone ‚Äì I wanted to share my story around HPV and the LEEP procedure because I know how stressful and confusing this journey can be. Hopefully, by sharing what I‚Äôve been through, it helps someone feel a bit more prepared and a bit less anxious.

I‚Äôm in Australia, so some of our medical systems and timelines might be a little different for those elsewhere.

Background: HPV ‚Äì The Virus No One I know really Talks About

I‚Äôm in the age group that missed out on the free HPV vaccine, and after a 25-year marriage and now being in a 4-year relationship, I was unfortunately exposed to HPV ‚Äì likely from someone who didn‚Äôt disclose it. I had STD testing, everything came back clear‚Ä¶ except I didn‚Äôt realise that HPV would be found in my Pap smear and this is the main cause of cervical cancer.

HPV isn‚Äôt something people openly talk about amongst my friends or family  (a bit like menopause, honestly), so I had no clue what it really meant. I thought it was ‚Äújust a virus‚Äù that the body clears on its own. While that‚Äôs true for many, that wasn‚Äôt the case for me. Research showed it was a bit more than I thought and I was a little freaked out as my very good friend had passed due to undiagnosed uterine cancer (she always went to a gyno - and they missed it all - 3 weeks and she passed - this is why please go to your Gyno please have your Pap smears please have your procedures and if you don‚Äôt think your gyno is giving you the right info change them get a second opinion‚Äôs - she would of had this for years and years) 

Year 1: First HPV Positive Result

Routine Pap ‚Äì HPV positive. No abnormal cells, so I was told just to wait and re-test in a year.

Year 2: Low-Grade Cell Changes

This time, I had low-grade abnormalities. My gyno at the time also decided to remove two polyps (unrelated to HPV), but didn‚Äôt check my cervix at all during the procedure. Which I didn‚Äôt realise and thought when she told me everything was ok it was but nope thankfully my other doctor sent me a please come in for a pap and found the low grade cells. After the Pap smear result I went back to the gyno, she used a vinegar solution test (colposcopy) which showed no visible abnormalities. Wait and see again 12 months. I actually changed gyno‚Äôs - I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the fact she had missed doing the cervix and the ‚Äòpolyps‚Äô where actually not what she said. Also she had put in an IUD to stop my weekly periods (peri-menopause which is now menopause) and after 6mths of going oh yes another month - when I changed it was definitely the right decision.

Year 3: High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL)

My next Pap came back showing HSIL. My GP explained it as being Stage 3 out of 4 in terms of cervical changes ‚Äì right before cancer (Stage 4), so I was promptly referred back to the gyno.

Thankfully, my new gyno was a lot calmer and did an in-office colposcopy with a punch biopsy (no ibuprofen and it didn‚Äôt really hurt ) ‚Äì it was quick, and honestly not painful for me. The results? ‚ÄúAll good, we‚Äôll just monitor for 12 months and hope HPV clears.‚Äù

Year 4: Same HSIL Results, Again

Another year, another HSIL result. This time, the colposcopy again showed nothing, and that‚Äôs when my gyno became more concerned. She suspected the abnormal cells could be hiding further up the cervical canal.

She booked me in for a LEEP procedure and hysteroscopy (to check further into the uterus) under general anaesthetic at a private hospital.

‚∏ª

The LEEP Procedure

Because I have private health, I was booked in within 4 weeks ‚Äì although the out-of-pocket costs were definitely high. Still, I was happy to pay for peace of mind.

I chose general anaesthetic, and honestly ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt have done it any other way. I went to sleep, woke up about an hour later, and it was done. The only pain I had was under my breastbone maybe a 3/10 ‚Äì a quick painkiller through the drip sorted that out.

Went home after a couple of hours, rested up.

‚∏ª

Recovery: The Real Details

Days 1‚Äì3:
Mild cramping and light bleeding, like a light period. Nothing major. I took the pain meds they gave me, though I don‚Äôt usually take anything ‚Äì only needed them for the first couple of days.

Days 4‚Äì7:
Bleeding changed ‚Äì started getting the famous ‚Äúcoffee grounds‚Äù texture and black blood (looks like charcoal, a bit strange but normal). Thanks, Reddit, for the heads-up.

Day 8 ‚Äì Things Got Scary:
That afternoon, I started bleeding bright red again. Not heavy enough to panic ‚Äì yet. But that night, I bled through my pad and onto the bed. Twice. By 4am, it was full-on. I had to sit upright because every time I stood I would have a clot come out and I‚Äôd bleed heavily.

By 8am, I was soaking through layers of pads ‚Äì one big pad underneath and two on top, still not enough. Every toilet trip came with small-to-medium clots. At 9am, i had moved to the lounge and as stood I passed a massive clot (bigger than my fist), and couldn‚Äôt leave the toilet due to the bleeding. I used a towel, called my partner, and we contacted the gyno‚Äôs office and left a message.

Her associate called me back, and once I explained everything, she immediately sent a hospital referral.

‚∏ª

Hospital Visit

At the hospital, the care was amazing. They stopped the bleeding over about 5 hours the scab had come off and a blood vessel underneath was oozing, causing the bleeding and clots. They treated it (painted the area ‚Äì slightly uncomfortable but bearable), monitored me for another hour, and sent me home. Total time: 7.5 hours.

‚∏ª

Post-Hospital Recovery

A few days after that, I passed a small clot again and some gritty brown discharge (probably from the solution they used at the hospital). Since then, things have settled. Some light blood, the occasional black discharge, but nothing worrying. I do feel super tired ‚Äì probably from the blood loss and stress ‚Äì but I‚Äôm okay.

‚∏ª

Final Outcome
I had found out I was abnormal cell free on the day the bleeding started and she told me it was a little deeper in the cervix hence why the punch test didn‚Äôt pick it up.

But honestly, she didn‚Äôt provide much aftercare advice. If I hadn‚Äôt already researched and used Reddit, YouTube, and even ChatGPT, I wouldn‚Äôt have known what was normal or when to worry.

Looking back, I realise I could have been in a really dangerous situation had I waited much longer to go to hospital.

‚∏ª

Things That Helped Me:
	‚Ä¢	This group (thank you all ‚Äì seriously!)
	‚Ä¢	Reddit threads with real experiences
	‚Ä¢	YouTube videos showing people‚Äôs stories
	‚Ä¢	ChatGPT (yes, I used it a lot to sanity-check what was happening and reduce my anxiety)

‚∏ª

Final Thoughts

If you‚Äôre going through this ‚Äì you‚Äôre not alone. Advocate for yourself. Ask the questions. Follow your gut. And rest when your body tells you to.

Thanks for letting me share my story ‚Äì I hope it helps someone out there feel a bit more informed and a little less freaked out ‚ù§Ô∏è

TLDR; had HSIL with HPV, Had my LEEP which went well but then had massive bleeding - am ok now but please please make sure you look aster your health and do this even if you have anxiety over it - better now than in a few years and it‚Äôs the next step.
