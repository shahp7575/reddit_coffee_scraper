1pcq6wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/1pcq6wc/community_support_enough_stuff/,Community Support - Enough Stuff,"# Our Vision for the Shop:

Enough Stuff is founded on the principle that there’s already enough stuff to go around and that the things we have collected hold their value after we are finished using them.  The shop is stocked with items that have been donated and those things are given away for free. For those who have money to contribute to the store, there are levels of monthly memberships available starting at [$10/month](https://www.enoughstuffclub.com/get-started). Or, you can make a one time contribution [here](https://www.enoughstuffclub.com/checkout/donate?donatePageId=5f47eb8c166aa940f1497033) on the website or when you come into the shop. This financial support keeps the bills paid and the doors open.

In addition to meeting the immediate needs of those without adequate clothing, home goods, and food pantry items, we envision a space where people can gather and build relationships with one another. 

This shop is for everyone. If you are in need of items, come get them. If you want to expand your wardrobe and pick up some knickknacks, we got you covered. If you’re able to supplement the operating costs of running such a place, [sign up today](https://contrabass-beagle-j96g.squarespace.com/get-started)! 

# Building Our Future: 

**A Campaign to Secure Enough Stuff's New Home**

Right now, we are operating out of 900 square feet. It's amazing how far we've come with the amount of donations we receive and the volunteers willing to tackle the day to day tasks. We have outgrown the space we use and will be able to serve the community more effectively and to our fullest potential with a larger space.

Our goal is to expand our space and our ability to serve the community by purchasing the building we currently rent from or one similar in East Peoria.

**Reaching this goal will help us:**

1. Host a **year-round heating and cooling space** for houseless guests to rest and socialize.
   * We already have free coffee and snacks for visitors but we would like to dedicate a room onsite for this purpose. 
2. Make use of a **public bathroom for people to practice essential hygiene** on a regular basis.
   * We currently have 1 small bathroom that is shared by volunteers and visitors. Ideally, we would have a shower stall in the new facility. At the very least, we would be able to offer a restroom to more than 1 person at a time.
3. Be **able to accept more item donations** from the community.
   * Because our shop is so small, we must limit donations to 1 garbage bag accepted per person each day. Otherwise, we quickly become overwhelmed with stuff piling up and nowhere to put it. 
4. Be able to use **onsite storage** and organizational systems.
5. Offer an **onsite laundry** service for houseless friends and to wash donations that are essential to the community but are not yet in clean enough condition.
6. **Stabilize our income** by leasing out other commercial units in the building to local businesses.

Hello r4r :) It's getting pretty chilly outside and I guess I'm just here looking for someone I can be cozy with this winter and beyond~, how about we meet at some cute cafe, get a nice warm drink and get to know each other and see how things go from there? Ideally I'd love for it to lead to something long term, but I'm also more than happy to just meet some cool people and be friends if that's the vibe!

I've been living Downtown Toronto for the last many years. I like to think I don't take myself too seriously, and very much in the nerdy/goofy/slightly chaotic kind of person, but in the cute sorta way 😅

I work in tech (which I love!) and outside work I'm mostly in a constant rotation of hobbies and learning about different things, but some of the stuff that's stuck around over the years have been photography, rubik's cubes and escape rooms. I also enjoy watching TV / movies, and I'm a sucker for comedy and sci-fi stuff. I don't read nearly as much as I would like in recent years, but I do enjoy the occasional audiobook and always looking for recommendations or sharing my favorite ones! I wanted to go into teaching, but sadly that didn't work out so nowadays I just settle for telling people the details about whatever I'm fascinated with at the moment.

I'm also generally a late night person - let's just say my sleep schedule has taken some creative liberties, so I'm always down for some late night hangs or spontaneous activities. Work is a little demanding sometimes so I do like to be a homebody more often than not, but I can be lured out with a fun activity or dinner/coffee plans.

Would very much prefer to meet in person and get to know each other as opposed to the endless-texting cycle that seems to be common lately. I find it much easier to see if we vibe together or not when we get to actually be around each other instead of online, and would appreciate trying to find something that works for us sooner rather than later.

For those that care: I'm 5'9 and originally from India. If that's a dealbreaker - well thanks for hearing me out anyway.

Who I'm looking for: Ideally someone who lives downtown or commutes there often, and is open to hanging out regularly and open to taking things by ear. I'm not particularly hung up on age / ethnicity etc as long as there's chemistry between us and we can enjoy each other's company. If you like dad jokes (send me one pls) and nerding out talking about things each other likes, you'll fit right in 😊

If any of this sounds like something you'd be interested in, drop me a message and let's figure out a cute hang that works for both of us~",1,1764723148.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I’m not gonna repeat the circumstances or anything but with my SP we have been in love for almost 3 years. My SP still is in love with me. He left Nov 18th. 

So we have been in contact over email. I sent him a email about my decision on the apartment on the 21st. He didn’t respond until the 23rd but he mentioned our coffee date in December when we back in our hometown (we moved away from it) he also said that he “there are times I want to speak to you, but I’m exercising restraint” because I messed up on the 20th and called him to leave voice mails. I realized that way that he actually unblocked my number. 

I did not answer his email until the 25th and then on the 28th after affirming every time I saw my phone “he keeps texting and calling me” 20 mins later he emailed me and he kept emailing me back and forth and same thing on the 29th. And on December 1st he emailed me all day too. I won’t say what it was about because the 3d is irrelevant. It’s the fact that I kept saying he is blowing up my phone and a little later he did. He also gave me the date for our coffee together and location + time. 

The reason the back and forth is significant is because the first week he took so long to email me. 

I keep having dreams about him and people in his circle keep adding me on socials. I keep seeing lady bugs, deer, red robins. I also keep seeing guys that look exactly like him.

I also today was walking home from hanging out with a friend and on the way back it was snowing and cold. There was these to girls coming towards me and they said the nickname he used to call me that is uncommon. It’s really not common nickname so them saying it made me feel so comfortable. 

Another thing is I got piano for sale notifications on Facebook marketplace and it’s the piano he wants since he plays piano. I never get notifications on Facebook for market place so I thought that was a sign. 

Also I’m in the same mood I was when we first started talking and also a guy I spoke to before my SP and I were official came back into my life trying to message me. 

I’m going to detach (not let go of the feeling that I have him just of the obsessiveness) and I believe that he is my life partner so I don’t feel as anxious as I did two weeks ago. I just know it will work out. Not going to reach out until our date for the 18th of December. 

If you have any advice lmk because I’m always learning and trying to be the best alchemist I can be 😊

1pcpyb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1pcpyb8/palpitations_for_two_weeks_trying_to_understand/,Palpitations for two weeks. Trying to understand them.,"I’ve been having palpitations for about two weeks now. They started randomly one day, tried to brush it off, but they have been pretty consistent. Some days are better than others, but I haven’t had a day with none. This happened to me almost exactly a year ago and I went to my Dr. about it. They did an EKG and echocardiogram, but everything came back normal. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure (170/110 in office) and was put on amplodipine. My blood pressure was 128/85 the year prior. The palpitations went away and then they randomly came back this year. I’ve been anxious since noticing them, but wasn’t feeling overly stressed or anxious prior.

I’ve noticed they tend to be triggered by bending over, or after eating. Sometimes they are preceded or followed up with a sensation of needing to burp or feeling “full” in my chest or throat. I have no other symptoms. No dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain etc. Occasionally the palpitations will make me feel a head rush feeling or lightheaded for about 2 seconds.

I’m relatively healthy other than the high BP, but I take my meds every day. I also use a CPAP for mild sleep apnea. 

I’m a 37 year old male. I’m 6’4” and 250 lbs. I lift weights 3 times a week and walk or play sports another 1-2 times a week.

I have no idea what is triggering the palpitations but it’s starting to drive me a little bit crazy. On the “bad” days I’ll have them every 5-15 minutes for a few hours.

Edit: I drink about 2 cups of dark roast coffee a day and I vape nicotine, but I’ve done this for years and never had any long standing palpitations other than these two instances over the past year.",2,1764722864.0,askCardiology,0,1.0,False

When I think about Tony, I always feel like I’m describing something that wasn’t supposed to happen but did. And it hit harder than I expected.

It started completely casually. We met in a sex chatroom. He made some witty comment about my nickname. We started talking like we were not in a place where we're supposed to trade nudes and talk about fantasies and I was shocked to be hooked into the conversation. We talked about cars, stressing jobs, success, music, life and I was so impressed with his intelligence and how much I enjoyed talking to him. Sex never came up.

We moved to telegram. I wanted to keep talking to this amazing stranger I'd found in the place I was least expecting to. From the very beginning, he wasn’t subtle. He was expressive, curious, emotional, almost boyishly enthusiastic. He wrote a lot. He opened up fast. He reacted to me like someone who saw in me exactly what I saw in him: we couldn't stop talking.

He wasn’t distant or guarded. He was warm, sweet, caring and emotionally present.  
He’d send long messages full of feeling.  
He’d tease, flirt, share memories, ask thoughtful questions.  
He’d check in during the day like he wanted to keep a thread tied between us at all times.

And then there were the rituals: the hearts he made in his coffee for me (he even tried with my initial), the little references to things that reminded him of me, the constant sense that he was letting me into a private emotional space he didn’t share with anyone else. He shared very personal and intimate experiences from his childhood, he really opened up. And I appreciated it so much. I could see what drove him, what had shaped him into this amazing human being I was starting to admire and care for. We talked a lot about our jobs and how important they are in our lives. For the first time in forever i had finally found someone who matched me: in energy, intensity, drive, mind, and yes, sexual fantasies too. We texted through the day and at night our chats were non stop messages that many times extended well into the next morning (I went to work with absolutely no sleep a couple of times). I was loving every minute of it.

He wasn't shy about complimenting me. How fascinating he found me, how smart I am, funny, driven. The exact kind of compliment I love and that makes my brain light up. I was becoming addicted to his texts but i didn't know that yet.

The catch ?

One night he casually revealed he was married. As casually as if he was telling me he had a pet parrot. It was no confession, no big ""off his chest"" moment he prepared me for. He was just telling me something that led into him admiting he had kids and when I asked ""wait, but you're single, right?"" RIGHT????

He just said ""no, I'm married""

I thought it was his attempt at. joke because it didn't make any sense.

He wasn't. He is indeed very married. His defense: ""it just never came up"". He says I never asked. I know I did ask that first night but him assuring me I didn't confused me. Maybe I didn't.

I told him I didn't feel comfortable talking to him anymore. There's nothing I despise more than a homewrecker or an affair. I don't do that shit.

I told him I felt betrayed by his ""omission"" and asked him not to text me again. He didn't.

I missed talking to him. He had already become a part of my day, the one ping from my phone I didn't ""ughh"" to.

A few weeks later I just had to know how he was. I needed to see a new message from him light up my screen again. And I said ""hey"".

The connection was there, intact. He was emotional and couldn't stop talking about how excited he was I texted him, how he hadn't stopped thinking about me and how torn he was between respecting my wishes and his desire to talk to me again.

I felt BAD. Like BAD bad. Physically bad. I threw up for like a week straight after reconnecting. I was the one thing I had always looked down on. And I loved it and hated it at the same time.

Now that I knew his situation I tried to make him see what I saw very clearly. Maybe I could talk to him to keep that exciting new connection I had found but keep my dignity too.

It was still flirty, still sexual but I kept pushing him to go to therapy. I asked about his marriage, his wife, his kids. He was open about it but detached. Like he was talking about the pet parrot again. He said his marriage felt like a good team but there was no romance, his wife wasn't a match for his mind. I could tell he was having a midlife crisis. And I told him. He was shocked but saw what I meant.

We kept talking. I was beginning to feel things for this man. I kept pushing about therapy. I knew once he started therapy he would stop this nonsense, go back to his perfect life and leave me hanging and I wanted that to happen as soon as possible before my feelings got bigger. I even told him that, word by word. Of course, he said that would never happen. Of course I didn't believe him.

I only asked him one thing: please don't disappear, don't ghost me; when you decide this has to end please say goodbye.

And he did:

""Hi Jen. How are you lady?

I just finish just now. I am pretty tired, hopefully it is helpful and useful.

I have been thinking quite a bit and hopefully I will start my soul searching process and that, I hope, will be good for me.

As much as it pains me to do so, I think it is better to cut our conversations now as I think they will only contribute to make things more difficult for both of us later. I have a long road ahead of me. That is the truth. And you cannot be stuck with that. You are an incredible person and you need to be able to flourish finding the person that makes you happy. I know that it is the right thing to do. Hard but the right thing.

I am sure that if we have to cross paths, we will. For now, I just wholeheartedly believe this is for the better and it will allow you to continue with your life. As it is, I am just a hurdle. And that is not right.

I hope you can kill it with your projects and keep growing that reputation of yours to reach wherever you want to go professionally. I do believe that you will get as far as you want to take it. It is totally under your control.

Anyways, I wanted to say this sooner rather than later as I believe is the best thing without a doubt.

I will leave the texts behind as nothing good can come out of that. At least for the time being.

I truly hope you can find your path and be truly happy. You deserve nothing less because you are such an incredible person.

Big kiss to you lady.""

And he never opened telegram again. His last seen recently turned into within a week, then to within a month.

He got to deliver his little bible of him playing the hero victim and simply left the room, closed the door and threw away the key. No, he threw a grenade in there and blew the damn room up.

I responded, of course. My in the moment responses were just shock and disappointment.

The next night with a clear head I wrote him back properly. That letter is floating in limbo, between heaven and hell.

Knowing something will happen doesn't prepare you for when it actually does. I keep checking telegram to see if he read it. He hasn't yet and I don't think he ever will.

SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (WPRI) — Police have arrested a North Kingstown man accused of crashing his car into a South Kingstown coffee shop early Tuesday morning.

Mark DeLong, 30, has been charged with of driving under the influence of liquor or drugs.

Police said DeLong was arrested after he crashed his Tesla into TLC Coffee Roasters on Kingstown Road around 1:30 a.m.

“Driving under the influence of alcohol or cannabis is never acceptable,” South Kingstown Police Chief Matthew Moynihan said. “There is no excuse for impaired driving — use a rideshare, call a friend, or stay put. Choosing to drive impaired is reckless, and the extensive damage to this small business is a direct result of that poor decision.”

Court records indicate DeLong was released on $1,000 personal recognizance.

TLC Coffee Roasters remained closed Tuesday due to the crash. The coffee shop confirmed on social media that it will be back open for regular business hours Wednesday.

I’m just sort of quickly making this post so it might be a bit short or erratic;

I started a new job a couple months ago my first proper job, finished college, working in banking now, I was pretty alright at the start.

But the last few weeks has just like snowballed into me just freaking out and being embarrassed because of what’s happening to me I guess. So I booked an appointment cause I’ve sorta just had enough of it now tbh.

I just get waves of, anxiety like for seemingly no reason. My stomach just like completely falls apart, my hands start shaking, I work at a desk next to people which changes every day but yeah it’s just mega embarrassing sitting there trying to use my mouse and my hands start shaking and then I know the person beside me can see it plus my stomach not being quiet and then I get embarrassed and then the cycle just repeats and then I get up and leave and come back multiple times to go to the bathroom even though I don’t even need to go to the bathroom, or even worse if someone comes over to talk to me or show me how to do something and I just be trying to hold everything together and it usually doesn’t work cause I start panicking etc etc. and yeah also for some reason my body just forgets how to even drink, I have water or coffee I can’t even explain it like I literally just stop being able to properly drink and just have to gulp stuff down which again, is bloody noisy and embarrassing and sets everything off again. My mouth gets full of saliva sometimes, not to do with drinking but I just remembered that also.

I also forget how to walk properly, if again that makes sense I just like walk weird, or when I’d come back from lunch as well I’d be breathing weird but I didn’t even walk that far for it to be, exercise induced or whatever.

Idk why this is all so much worse now cause really it would be natural to be nervous for the first week or few days but like why is this happening now.

Anyways I had a few Xanax from years ago, which I did not get from the doctor, but I had 2 0.5mg pills so Monday and today I had 0.25mg in the morning and then another 0.25 at lunchtime and it did help for the most part.

I can’t tell the doctor that though, I was personally thinking maybe Clonazepam cause it would last for most of my day at work probably.
But they probably won’t even prescribe me a benzo I’m guessing anyway but it did help.

Any thoughts?

I also have no housing atm for this as my landlord/house contact was meant to have me move in September but it’s being renovated and delayed and delayed so I think I’ll be able to move in at the end of December finally which may also be playing a part on this but it’s not something I really think about at work, it is causing financial strain though as I have to book hotels/apartments each week.

My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

1pcpt47,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pcpt47/mf_a_walk_back/,[MF] A Walk Back,"The valley didn’t look the way I remembered it, but my body knew it before my eyes did.

The air had that soft, humming heat of a Virginia summer afternoon. Grasshoppers clicked in the high fescue. Somewhere out of sight, a mourning dove called, low and patient. The hills rose up on both sides, green and rolling, shouldering the sky like they’d been here long before me and would be here long after.

I stood at the edge of the gravel drive and stared down toward the farmhouse.

The old place sat right where it always had in my memory: white two-story, black tin roof that used to pop and tick when the sun heated it. The paint still peeled a little around the windows in my mind, and the porch sagged just enough to show its age. The long quarter-mile driveway crept away from the house, curling through the fields until it disappeared between the two old gates at the road.

To the left, the garden spread wide like a patchwork quilt. Tall tomatoes staked with broken boards and twine. Rows of corn, tassels rustling. Beans climbing wire and wood. Squash leaves big as dinner plates. And near the far side, the pear tree—wide-limbed, heavy-leafed, a big old thing that shaded the edge of the garden.

Down past all that, maybe a hundred and fifty yards from the back porch, the pond cupped the sky, ringed in cattails and scrub. The water lay still and dark, dragonflies stitching shimmer along its skin.

It felt so real I could almost hear the screen door slam.

“You’re late,” a voice said beside me.

I turned.

He was small and thin and sun-browned, standing in the dust at my elbow. Nine. I knew the age as surely as I knew my own name—because he *was* my own name, pulled out of another year.

He wore a T-shirt that had seen better days and jeans that were a little short at the ankles. His sneakers—hand-me-downs from his aunt—were scuffed and gray where they used to be white. His hair stuck up at the back like he’d just gotten out of bed and never fixed it. There was a stubborn set to his jaw I knew from mirrors and old photos.

But it was his eyes that knocked the breath out of me.

Wide. Watchful. Older than they ought to be.

“Guess I am,” I said.

He shifted, digging the toe of his shoe into the gravel. “Been waiting.”

“For how long?”

He shrugged. “Long time.”

We stood together in the driveway, looking at the house and the fields spread around it. No neighbors, just the hills, corn and pasture, and that big blank Virginia sky pressing down on everything.

A breeze came up out of the fields, moving the tall grass in waves. I could smell earth and cut hay and the faint sweetness of the pear tree near the garden.

The sagging porch rail. The screen door hanging a little crooked on its hinge. The porch closed in at the top with screen my dad had built himself, boards a little uneven, wire stapled in place by a man doing the best he could with what he had.

“You’re really here,” the boy said.

“Looks like it,” I answered.

He didn’t look at me. His eyes stayed locked on the house like it might move if he glanced away. “You know you’re not supposed to be,” he said. “You left.”

“And you stayed,” I said.

“Somebody had to.”

We started down the drive together, his shorter legs moving quick to keep pace. Gravel crunched underfoot in that familiar rhythm. I’d walked this road a hundred times as a boy—heading to the bus, hauling groceries, stomping off after fights. The curve of it lived in my bones.

“You still sleeping in that big front room?” I asked as the house grew closer.

He nodded. “Yeah. The big room with the spiral staircase.” A quick, crooked smile ghosted across his face. “Gets hot. But we got two windows, so sometimes I climb out on the roof when it’s not too bad. Just gotta be careful ‘cause of the pitch.”

“Yeah,” I said. The memory lit up in my chest—a boy on a tin roof at dusk, watching fireflies and pretending the house didn’t feel like a ticking bomb underneath him. “I remember.”

We got to the flat stretch of drive where everything opened up: the farmhouse ahead, the garden to the left, the pond down the slope, the hills folding around it all like cupped hands.

“You still don’t like it here,” he said suddenly.

“No,” I said, because there wasn’t any point lying to him. “I don’t.”

“Me neither,” he said. “But I gotta live here anyway.”

We veered off the drive and into the mowed path that cut between the garden and the front of the house. The air was thicker here, full of tomato vine, damp dirt, the sharp green of bean leaves climbing the fence.

He drifted toward the garden edge, hand trailing along the wire. “You remember helping weed this?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I said. “Back hurt. Knees muddy. Bugs everywhere.”

“Sometimes it felt good, though,” he said quietly. “Just… quiet. Just work. Trying to make Dad happy. Hoping he’d tell us he was proud.” His mouth twisted. “But that never happened.”

My throat tightened. “No,” I said. “It didn’t.”

We walked along the fence until we came even with the pear tree. It towered over us, branches spread wide like arms mid-hug, leaves whispering against one another. Pears hung heavy, some starting to blush yellow, some small and hard and green.

He reached up and touched one with his fingertips. “They never last,” he said. “The pears. They get ripe and then they’re gone. Bugs or birds or they just…” He made a little falling motion with his hand. “You gotta watch the ground. Wasps, hornets, bees all over down there. Mom takes some, wraps ‘em in newspaper and puts ‘em under the house with the potatoes, so they don’t go bad all at once.”

“Yeah,” I said, and the smell of overripe fruit and damp dirt came back so sharp it almost hurt.

We passed the tree and stepped into the open yard. The house loomed up, all white boards and black roof, windows squinting in the sun. Up close you could see every flaw—cracked steps, peeling paint, screen door hanging crooked. And underneath it all, that feeling I’d carried out of this place like a brand:

*Anything can happen. Any time.*

“You still sleeping in that big room,” I said again, more to myself than to him.

“Yeah,” he said. “Every night. Listening.”

“For what?”

“Voices,” he said. “Screaming. Things breaking. Bodies hitting the floor. Trying to tell if I should stay in bed or get ready to run.”

I swallowed. “You don’t know if they’re gonna fight,” I said.

He shook his head. “You know how it is. Some nights you’re walking home from the bus and you just… don’t wanna turn in the driveway. ‘Cause you don’t know what you’re walking into.” He glanced up at me. “You still remember that?”

“Every time I get off a bus in a story I write,” I said. “Every time I walk from my truck to my own front door and my chest goes tight for no good reason. Yeah. I remember.”

He frowned at the house. “You asked if we got out,” he said. “You didn’t answer.”

“We did,” I said. “I did. I’m not here anymore. Not really.”

“You got a house?” he asked. “A real one?”

“Yeah,” I said. Then I corrected myself, because I’d promised him truth. “It’s rented. Not mine on paper. Not yet. It still feels wrong to plant roots too deep. But it’s steady. We’ve been there. We pay the bills. We’re looking for one that’s ours for real—put-your-name-on-the-paper, nobody-can-take-it kind.”

“People can always take it,” he muttered.

“Not the same way,” I said. “I work. We make good money. No one’s showing up out of nowhere to say we gotta be gone by the weekend. If we move, it’s ‘cause we chose it.”

He chewed on that in silence. Somewhere out in the corn, the wind moved in a slow rush, leaves whispering like a train that never came. I’d forgotten that sound, nights staring at the ceiling and listening to the wind in the rows, wishing I could just walk and walk down those furrows and never come back.

“You married?” he asked finally.

“Yeah,” I said. “Got a wife.”

“Is she like… her?” He didn’t say Mom, but we both knew who he meant.

“She’s her own person,” I said. “She can get loud. People do. But not like here. Not the kind of loud that turns the whole house sideways. Not the kind where you’re trying to figure out which version of her you’re going to get that night.”

I took a breath, feeling the weight of it.

“It wasn’t hitting. It wasn’t throwing things. It wasn’t that kind of danger. When she wasn’t drinking, she was *there*—present, loving, doing everything she could to make our poor life feel happier. She tried. God, she tried. She gave us good moments, real ones.”

He looked at me like he wanted to believe that part.

“But when she drank,” I continued, “she wasn’t gone, but she wasn’t *her*. She was in the room and nowhere at the same time. Controlling one minute, emotional the next, picking fights out of air. You never knew if she’d want to laugh or argue.”

His eyes flickered, like he remembered trying to read the weather in someone’s face.

“And it wasn’t just the words,” I said softly. “Sometimes she’d fall. Just… collapse. Lose her balance. I was the one who had to deal with it. A kid. Nine years old, trying to keep her from hurting herself. Sometimes her shoulder would pop out, and I’d have to put it back in place. I didn’t even know what I was doing—just scared, trying to fix something too big for me.”

He swallowed hard, because he knew that fear intimately.

“That’s what messed me up,” I said. “Not fists. Not bruises. Just being a child who had to act like a parent. Being scared for her, and scared of what the night might turn into. That’s not how my house is now. My kids never have to wonder who’s walking down the hall. They know.”

He nodded once, quick, like that matched what he knew.

“And kids,” I said. “We got five.”

His head jerked up. “Five?”

“Yeah. Five crazy, smart, loud, ridiculous kids.”

“Do they know… any of this?” he asked, waving a hand at the house.

“Some,” I said. “As much as they need to. I tell ‘em enough so they understand why I’m jumpy sometimes, why I hate certain noises. But I don’t dump all this on their shoulders. They don’t need to carry what you carried.”

He seemed to relax a little at that. “Good,” he said. “They shouldn’t.”

We walked down the slope toward the pond, the grass brushing our shins, seed heads catching our jeans. The water got bigger, shining dark under the afternoon sun.

Down at the edge, we stopped. Our reflections peered back—one tall fat man with tired shoulders, one skinny boy with thin wrists and eyes too sharp. The water bent us a little, but not enough to hide how much of him still lived in me.

“You still think about Dad?” he asked without looking up.

“Yeah,” I said. “All the time.”

“He still mean?” the boy asked. “Still throwing stuff? Still yelling?”

I shook my head. “He’s gone,” I said. “Dead. Been a while now.”

He was quiet. “He get any better first?” he asked.

“Some,” I said. “He got a lot less mean.” I let the words sit there the way they needed to, plain and not pretty. “He tried. We had twenty good years at the end. Real ones. He was like a best friend for a long time.”

The boy frowned at our reflections, as if he was trying to draw that version of our father into them. “How’s that happen?” he asked. “He’s… like *this* here.” He jerked his chin back toward the house. “How’s he become your best friend?”

“Slow,” I said. “Messy. Hard. He got old. I did too. We talked. We forgave things we could’ve held onto. We carried scars, but we didn’t let ‘em boss us around. He loved me at the end in the right way, and he was proud of me. He just… ran out of time.”

The boy looked down at his shoes. “So he still left,” he said.

“Yeah,” I said. “But not ‘cause he chose to. That part matters.”

He shrugged, but I could see the way that distinction scraped. From where he still lived, leaving was leaving.

“What about Mom?” he asked.

“She’s still here,” I said. “Still alive. She’s still my best friend. We talk. We laugh. We remember. She’s not perfect. I’m not either. But we found a way to be in each other’s lives that doesn’t hurt like this place did.”

“She still…?” He didn’t finish the sentence, just tipped his head back toward the house.

“Not like back then,” I said. “It’s different now. And I’ve got boundaries. That’s a word you don’t know yet, but you’ll be grateful for it later.”

He snorted, a sound too bitter for his age. “I’d just be grateful for one quiet year,” he said. “No screaming. No bottles. No wondering if tonight’s the night we gotta pack again.”

A frog plopped into the pond, ripples spreading across our reflections. The wind shifted, bringing the faint creak of the porch swing, the smell of the garden, the memory of nights lying awake listening for raised voices and bodies hitting the floor.

“Can I tell you something?” I asked.

He shrugged. “You’re gonna.”

I smiled a little. “You helped me survive,” I said.

His head snapped around. “What?”

“You did,” I said. “You learned how to read every room in five seconds. You figured out when to crack a joke, when to disappear, when to stand still and not breathe too loud. You learned how to live in a house where you never knew which way the night would go. Nobody taught you that. You did it on your own.”

He stared at me, uncomfortable. “I just… did what I had to,” he muttered.

“Exactly,” I said. “You did what you had to. And we made it out. That’s not nothing.”

He looked back at the pond. His eyes were shiny now, but he blinked hard, like he could press the tears back into place. “I’m tired,” he whispered. “I’m so tired.”

“I know,” I said softly. “You’ve been driving a long time.”

His brow furrowed. “Driving?”

“Being in charge,” I said. “Running the show. You decided early nobody else could keep us safe, so you took the wheel. Even after the house changed, even after the people in it did, you kept holding on.”

He hugged his arms around his chest. “If I let go,” he said, “we crash.”

“We already crashed sometimes,” I said. “You remember. Things still went bad. But you got us through. You got me to now.”

He sniffed. “You said you got a place now,” he said. “A house. Even if it’s rented.”

“Yeah,” I said. “We got four walls that don’t feel like this. We’ve been there long enough my kids think staying put is normal. They decorate their rooms. They complain when we make ‘em clean ‘em. They don’t lie awake listening for whatever you’re listening for.”

He stared at our reflections. “Must be nice,” he muttered.

“It is,” I said. “That’s kind of the point.”

He was quiet a minute, then said, “You said you got kids. Five.”

“Yeah.”

“You hit ‘em?” he asked, not accusing, just checking.

“No,” I said firmly. “I don’t hit them. I raise my voice sometimes. I get it wrong. But I try again. I tell ‘em I was wrong when I am.”

He let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding.

“They got the same rooms,” I went on. “Same beds. Same door to close at night. They eat and drink soda, they earn their own money, they play games all day when they can get away with it, and they get to sleep soundly and peacefully.”

“They don’t lay there waiting for something bad?” he asked.

“No,” I said. “They take safety for granted.” I smiled. “That’s the point.”

He nodded slowly, staring at the water. “Tell me about them,” he said. “The kids.”

So I did.

I told him their names, their ages. The way one of them laughs so hard they fall off the couch. The way another furrows their brow when they draw, lost in their own worlds. The way one of them is about to be a father himself—yeah, *he is*, we’re about to be grandparents. The way the one who gets mad stomps and huffs and slams her door but always, always comes back for a hug.

I told him about late-night talks in the living room, not the kitchen table war councils he knew, but soft conversations about fear and hope and what comes next. I told him about school plays where nobody showed up drunk or high. About family dinners that ended with dishes clanking and video games starting up instead of yelling and bodies hitting the floor.

He listened with a look on his face like he was holding water in cupped hands and didn’t want to spill any.

“They don’t know how lucky they are,” he said when I finished.

“They’re not supposed to,” I said. “That’s my job. That’s your job. We took the hit so they didn’t have to.”

He rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand. “You make it sound like what I did… mattered,” he said.

“It did,” I said. “It matters every day.”

We sat there in the grass at the edge of the pond. The sun slid lower, turning the water to bronze. The frogs got louder. Crickets tuned up in the weeds.

After a while, he said, “So who’s driving now?”

“Me,” I said. “Grown me. Adult me. The one who knows about working and how to give love without making it hurt. The one who keeps track of school schedules, who cooks chicken without burning it most nights, who drove the hospital runs when the babies were born. The one who makes sure the bills get paid and the lights stay on.”

He glanced at my belly, at the way my T-shirt stretched over it. “You don’t look like no hero,” he said.

“I’m not,” I said. “I’m just a man who learned some things you didn’t have the chance to yet. And I learned ‘em ‘cause you kept us alive long enough for it to happen.”

He looked back at the house. “If I let go,” he said again, softer now, “if I move over, you promise you won’t leave me here?”

I turned to him. “I never left you,” I said. “You’ve been with me the whole time. Every time I flinch at a raised voice. Every time I double-check a lock. Every time I get scared for no reason when things are good. That’s you. You’re not trapped in this valley. You’re sitting in my chest.”

He blinked hard. “Feels like I’m still here.”

“‘Cause nobody told you different,” I said. “Nobody came back down this driveway for you. That’s what I’m doing now.”

He was quiet a long time. Then he said, barely audible, “I don’t know how to stop.”

“I know,” I said. “So we don’t do it all at once. You don’t have to disappear. You don’t have to throw your hands up and jump out of the truck. You just… loosen your grip. Move your hands a little. Let mine slide over the wheel.”

He flexed his fingers like he could feel it. “What if you mess up?” he asked. “What if you fall asleep at the wheel?”

“Then I fix it,” I said. “I don’t blame you. I don’t hand it back to you and say it’s your job again. That’s part of the deal. You protected me when you had no business having that much weight on you. I can carry it now.”

He stared at me, measuring the truth in my voice the way he’d once measured the mood in a room.

“Can we go look at the house?” he asked suddenly. “Not go in. Just… look. One more time.”

“Yeah,” I said. “We can do that.”

We climbed back up the slope, passing the pear tree, the garden rows glowing green and gold in the lowering light. The porch screen rattled in the breeze. The black tin roof clicked as the heat started to leak out of it.

We stopped at the edge of the yard, a few yards from the steps.

Up close, the house looked smaller than the giant I remembered. The boards were just boards. The windows just glass. The door just a door.

“It looked bigger,” he said, echoing my thought.

“Yeah,” I said. “A lot of monsters do when you’re nine.”

We stood there together, staring at the place that had made us and bent us and hurt us.

“This house doesn’t get to decide who you are,” I said. “It shaped you. It scared you. It held some good moments too, and we won’t lie about that. But it doesn’t own you.”

He took a deep breath. “Can I say something to it?” he asked.

“Go ahead.”

He squared his shoulders, that familiar stubbornness burning clean for once instead of just defensive.

“You didn’t beat me,” he said to the siding and the windows and the tin roof. His voice shook but held. “You tried. You scared me. You messed me up. But I got out. I got big. I got kids. I got a place that isn’t you. And you can’t make me leave it.”

The words hung in the warm air, brighter than the setting sun.

I looked at him. His chest heaved, but his eyes were clear.

“That was good,” I said.

“Yeah,” he said, like he wasn’t quite sure what to do with that feeling. “Felt… good.”

We turned back toward the drive. From here, the valley stretched in front of us: the gates at the road, the fields on either side, the hills beyond. The same road I’d once dreaded walking up from the bus stop now looked like a path out.

At the top of the gravel, where the house slipped out of sight behind us, he slipped his small hand into mine.

I didn’t startle this time. I just closed my fingers gently around his.

“You can rest, you know,” I said.

“I’ll try,” he said.

“That’s enough,” I answered.

As we walked, the valley began to blur at the edges, the details softening. The black tin roof, the white house, the pond, the pear tree, the long double-gated drive—all of it folded into light and memory.

The last thing I felt before it faded was the weight of his hand in mine, small and warm and not gripping for dear life anymore—just holding on.

When I opened my eyes, I was in my own rented house. The ceiling above me was smooth and familiar. The sounds were the ones I’d grown used to—an AC hum, pipes ticking, one of the kids laughing down the hall, a controller clicking in the basement. Somewhere, my wife moved through the kitchen, coffee making, ordinary noises.

My chest felt loose in a way it hadn’t in years.

I took a breath and let it out slow.

We hadn’t rewritten the past. The farmhouse still stood in Lovettsville, somewhere in the file drawers of my nervous system. The nights were still what they were. The bodies still hit the floor. The boy still learned to listen and stay ready.

But now he wasn’t alone in that house anymore.

He’d scooted over. I had both hands on the wheel.

And for the first time, as I listened to the quiet, I could tell him the truth and feel him believe it:

*We’re not there anymore.*

1pcpsmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pcpsmb/shedwell_pt_1/,She(d)well (pt. 1),"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

1pcprsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1pcprsm/shedwell_pt_1/,She(d)well (pt. 1),"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

1pcprbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkFantasy/comments/1pcprbz/shedwell_pt_1/,She(d)well (pt. 1),"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

1pcpqvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1pcpqvb/shedwell_pt_1/,She(d)well (pt. 1),"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

1pcpqat,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pcpqat/shedwell_pt_1/,She(d)well (pt. 1),"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

1pcppuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1pcppuc/shedwell_pt_1/,She(d)well (pt. 1),"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

1pcppcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyPastas/comments/1pcppcl/shedwell_pt_1/,She(d)well (pt. 1),"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

1pcpovj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1pcpovj/shedwell/,She(d)well,"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.",1,1764722155.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

1pcpo51,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pcpo51/shedwell/,She(d)well,"The mall is so brightly lit I feel like I could see my own thoughts reflected on the polished floor. My friend walks ahead of me with quick, determined steps, convinced that all this is an exciting adventure.

“Look,” she says, pointing at a display full of adapters. “You need a universal adapter. Don’t buy it over there—they’ll rip you off.”

I nod. I’m not sure if it’s because I actually heard her or because my mind is somewhere else, trying to process that in two weeks I’ll be living in a place where no one knows me. I’m holding my folded list in my hand.

* Adapters.
* Medications.
* TSA lock.
* Compact cosmetics.

The word “compact” is underlined, but I don’t remember doing that.

“Did you already buy the small suitcase?” she asks, not slowing down.

“Yeah. It arrived yesterday.”

“Perfect. Just remember not to overpack it. The less you take, the fewer questions they ask you at immigration. I learned that the hard way.”

Immigration.

The word runs through me like a cold current. Not because I fear something specific, but because of the idea of being inspected without context, evaluated by eyes that don’t know me, that don’t know what I carry or what I leave behind. The obvious, historical discrimination and over-inspection some of us get simply for being from certain places.

“They say the officers are super intimidating,” I say.

“Well, yeah, but relax. Documents, smile, next.”

I smile. I wish I could take things as lightly as she does.

We walk into a perfume store. She starts tossing things into the basket:

“These little bottles are for your creams. Everything has to go in here, you know that. And compact makeup. That always gets through.”

Compact.

Again that sensation of… attention. As if some silent, animal part of me lifted its head to listen more carefully.

We keep walking. She picks up a translucent powder and offers it to me.

“Because the plane dries your skin out like crazy. Oh, and don’t even think of bringing dog treats or food. You’re gonna miss your girl, but they won’t let any of that through.”

I stopped.

Not physically, but inside.

The image of my dog hits me in the chest in a painful way, like someone poked a small hole in me with something sharp.

“I wish I could take her,” I murmur. My friend squeezes my shoulder.

“Don’t be dramatic. She’ll be fine. Your mom and your aunt spoil her rotten.”

I nodded, but I don’t feel better. Not because she won’t be fine. I know she will. But I won’t.

She keeps talking, telling me that the first time she got off the plane she thought she was going to faint, that the officers looked like robots, that she never found the right gate. I barely listen. Because when we reach the makeup section, everything changes.

The wall is covered in compact eyeshadows. Soft colors, bold ones, metallics, mattes. Perfect little disks, each full of pressed powder that looks solid but crumbles at the slightest touch—crumbles, and then adheres to the skin as if it recognizes it.

I run my finger over one of the testers. The pigment stays on my fingertip, silky, obedient. And then, without warning, my mind does something strange: I imagine that same gesture, but with… something of mine. Or rather: something of hers.

It’s not a full image. There is no plan, no intention, no hint of malice. Just an intuition, a soft feeling that flickers inside my chest like a firefly.

My friend says behind me:

“That one looks great on you. And it’s super useful. Immigration doesn’t care about that.”

Immigration doesn’t care about that.

It doesn’t care about powder.

It doesn’t care about compacts.

It doesn’t care what someone presses into a tiny, pretty container.

I stay silent. Not because I’ve already decided something, but because for the first time I feel an idea almost forming. A warm little thought: These things can be pressed.

 

I shouldn’t be awake. I have to get up early tomorrow to keep packing, organizing, doing everything that still needs to be done. But as soon as I turn off the light, something in my head stays on. And it’s not excitement. It’s not fear. It’s… something else. A kind of thought that doesn’t arrive as a sentence, but as a sensation: missing.

I lie on my back, in that darkness that makes the room feel smaller. Next to me, curled into a perfect ball, is Nina, breathing deeply, warm, trusting. I hear her twitch her paws against the blanket as if she’s dreaming of running. That sound tightens my chest.

Fuck… what am I supposed to do without this? Without her?

People say “you get used to it,” as if getting used to being without someone who organizes your entire day with a single look were some simple bureaucratic task. As if I didn’t know what happens to me when I’m alone for too long. As if I didn’t know myself.

I sniff my hands: they still smell like the brush I used to groom her a little while ago. That smell of sunlight, park dust, of her. It’s so soft… But tomorrow it will already be fading. And in two weeks, I’ll be gone too.

I sit up in bed. She opens one eye, watches me. She doesn’t bark, doesn’t move. She just looks at me as if she already knows I’m about to break, as if she were the only one who understands that my mind spirals instead of moving in straight lines.

And then, there in the dim light, the idea forms more clearly. Not as a whisper, but as a certainty: if I can’t take her, I can take something of her. Something real. Something that is hers and mine. Something that can… be absorbed.

My skin prickles with recognition. Because it’s not that strange, is it?

People keep locks of their kids’ hair.

Some turn ashes into diamonds.

Others make necklaces out of baby teeth.

And everyone calls that love.

I just need something that won’t get lost in a box, that won’t end up forgotten in some drawer in a country I won’t return to anytime soon. Something that will go with me everywhere—through immigration, on buses, to work, to class. Something that will be on me, in me, clinging to my skin. Something that, when I touch myself, will remind me: you’re not alone.

Nina falls back asleep as I stroke her belly. I don’t. I stay up until dawn, knowing I still don’t know how.

But I already know what.

 

The phone vibrates just as I’m folding a T-shirt I know, with absolute certainty, I will never wear in the climate of my new country. But I pack it anyway. As if packing useless objects could give me some sense of continuity.

I see the name on the screen: **Alejandra**.  
An entire university encapsulated in a single name and a different city.

“**Finally! You answered!**” she says the second I pick up. Her voice always sounds as if she’s walking quickly, even when she’s sitting down.

“Sorry, I was packing… well, trying to,” I reply.

“I get you. Every time I move I end up in an existential crisis because I have no idea why the hell I’ve accumulated so many birthday napkins.”

We laugh. We talk a bit about her life: that work in the other city is rough, that the weather there is so dry and cold she sometimes feels she’s turning into a statue, that she went out with someone a couple of times but meh. Things that don’t really change, even if years go by.  
And then, without transition, she pauses and says:

“**I’m really going to miss you.**”  
She doesn’t say it dramatically or crying. She says it like she’s telling me the simplest truth in the world.

And it hurts. Not in the chest, but lower, where last night’s idea seems to have fallen asleep and now opens one eye.

“Me too,” I answer.

“Well,” she says, as if trying not to let the silence grow too large. “How are *you* feeling now? What do your mom and aunt say? Are they ready to let you go?”

I sigh.

“They’re okay…” I begin, refolding the T-shirt I’ve already folded three times. “They’re going to miss me, yes, but they get it. They support me. They know why I’m doing this, what my reasons are.”

“Of course they do,” she says. “They’ve always been your official fan club.”

I nodded, even though she can’t see me.

“They tell me they’ll miss me, and that I’ll miss them too… but that we’ll be fine. That it’s part of growing up, of moving forward.”

“And you? How do *you* feel?”

I want to say “the same.” But it isn’t true.

“I don’t know,” I answer. “Sometimes excited, sometimes… like everything is too big for me.”

“That’s normal.”

“Yeah, but…” I stopped. Because I already know where that *but* is going. “But Nina…”

“Oh,” she says, with that tone she uses when she wants to gently prod a wound. “Nina doesn’t know any of this, does she?”

I pressed the phone harder against my ear, as if that could hold me together.

“No,” I say. “She just sees me more anxious, packing things. She’s been sticking to me a lot lately. Like she knows. Or like I’m sticking her to me so… so…”

“So what?” Aleja asks.

To not lose her.  
To not feel like I’m leaving her here while I go live a life she doesn’t fit into.  
To not rip out half my body from one day to the next.  
But I say:

“I don’t know how she’s going to take this change. It’s so abrupt. And I don’t know how I’m going to…” my voice scratches in my throat “how I’m going to be without her. It’s like they’re tearing out something fundamental.”

My friend stays quiet. Not an uncomfortable silence—an understanding one.

“It’s normal that it hurts,” she finally says. “She’s your baby.”

I know.

I know it so deeply that last night, in the dark, that certainty turned into an idea I can still feel vibrating faintly under my skin, like a half-asleep hum. Something that said: take her with you in the only way possible.  
Something that didn’t feel insane.  
Something that felt… logical.

The conversation continues, warm, easy, affectionate, but every word about the trip, about leaving, about letting things behind, makes that nocturnal idea stir and take a bit more shape.  
The call ends.  
My friend promises to visit. I promise to try not to collapse in the airport. We hang up.

I stay silent.

Nina walks into the room dragging her favorite toy—a stuffed gorilla we call Kong—and drops it at my feet as if offering me a gift. I look at her. She looks at me.  
And the humming returns.  
Clearer than before.

 

It begins like an ordinary act. Or at least, that’s what I want to believe. I open the drawer where I keep Nina’s brush. There are bits of hair trapped in the bristles, tangled like tiny strands of grey light. Usually, I pull them out and throw them away without thinking. But today… no. Today I open a small zip-lock bag, one of those I bought to “organize accessories,” and leave it open on the bed. Nina comes closer, wagging her tail. She suspects nothing; for her this is affection, routine, connection.

“Come here, baby…” I say, lifting her onto my lap.

I start brushing her. Slowly. Slower than usual. With an almost surgical care. Each time I lift the brush, I look at the strands that stayed behind, and instead of tossing them into the trash, I pick them up with my fingers and place them inside the bag.

The first time I do it, my heart beats fast. Not because it’s forbidden, but because it’s… deliberate. I’m collecting my dog. In pieces. Like someone gathering crumbs not to lose their way back. The hair falls softly onto the plastic. A tiny tuft. Then another. And another.

After a few minutes, the bag has enough in it for any normal person to wonder what the hell I’m planning. But for me it’s barely the beginning. I close the bag with a snap. That sound is too final for something so small.

Nina looks up at me, tilting her head. She has that expression that always melts me: the silent question. The absolute trust. I stroke her face with my fingers, the same fingers that now smell, faintly, of her skin. That smell is no metaphor: it’s literal. It’s embedded.  
I let her climb off my lap. She shakes herself and trots away to chase a ray of sunlight on the floor.

I stay on the bed. Looking at the bag. My breathing is very still. So still I can hear myself think. *This isn’t strange,* I tell myself. *This is just… preparing.* And that word comforts me more than it should. I tuck the bag into a hidden pocket in my travel backpack. I close it with the same solemnity someone else might reserve for storing a passport.  
And then… another dream, another thought.

Later, while folding clean clothes and brushing some lint off my own shirt, I catch myself staring at Nina’s bed: her blanket, her Kong toy, a sock of mine she stole weeks ago. And I think: *I can reason this out. I can understand I’m leaving, that I’ll come back, that she’ll be fine. But she can’t.* Dogs live in a present that smells. Of us. Of their people. Of home. If our smell disappears, to them it’s as if we disappear.

And something ignites—slowly—like recognizing a pattern in a photograph:  
I’m taking something of hers with me. But she… what does she have of mine that can truly stay with her forever? Not a sweater. Not a blanket. Those things lose their scent. They get washed. They get forgotten. She needs something deeper. Something that comes from me in the same way that what I’m keeping comes from her.

I don’t know where this new certainty comes from, but it arrives complete. She deserves something of mine too. Something real. Something that can stay with her while I’m gone.  
I look at my hands. My nails. My skin. Skin. Cells. Microscopic flakes. The smallest version of oneself. And then I realize: the idea is no longer one-sided. It’s not just possession.  
It’s exchange.

A pact.

She will be with me, in me. And I will be with her, in her. An invisible exchange between two beings who don’t know how to live without each other’s scent. I never thought the word *handmade* could carry such… intimacy.

I open YouTube and type “DIY natural makeup no chemicals,” and an ocean of pastel thumbnails appears: feminine hands holding homemade palettes, dried flowers, wooden spoons, essential oils in jars with cursive labels.

Perfect.

A perfect aesthetic to hide anything. I click on a video where the girl smiles too much.

“Today I’ll show you how to make your own compact blush with 100% natural, cruelty-free ingredients.”

The irony almost makes me laugh. Almost.

I sit at my desk. Take out the zip-lock bag with Nina’s hair. Place it beside the laptop, out of frame, even though no one else is watching. The girl in the video shows beetroot powder, pink clay, jojoba oil, and explains how “each ingredient adds color, texture, and hold.” I take notes. But my mind is elsewhere.

Every time she says “base,” I think *substrate.*  
Every time she says “hold,” I think *retention.*  
Every time she says “pigment,” I think *Nina.*

The tutorial is too simple:  
— Pulverize.  
— Mix.  
— Press.

Three steps. So easy they almost feel like an invitation.

I search for another video: a more complex recipe for compact eyeshadows. This one uses vegetable glycerin, isopropyl alcohol, and mineral pigments. In the end everything fits into a little metal case with a mirror. That’s what I need. Something with a mirror. Customs would only see makeup. A pink powder. Or terracotta. Or gold. Something that smells like nothing. That doesn’t smell like Nina.

I close my eyes and open the bag. The smell *is* there. Faint, almost imperceptible, but there. Sun-warmth. Dry grass. Her. I check the videos again. Many say the same thing:

*“If your powder has a scent, add essential oils.”*  
*“Fragrance will cover any unwanted smell.”*

*Unwanted.*

The word irritates me.

I take a ceramic mortar. Pour in the tufts carefully. They’re so soft they almost feel like smoke caught in fibers. I start grinding slowly. The sound is strange: a soft friction, almost sandy. The texture changes under pressure. First strands. Then filaments. Then fine powder, greyish, with tiny beige traces. I stop. Look at it. My heart doesn’t beat fast. It beats deep.

It’s so easy.

So incredibly easy to turn a loved being into something that fits in the palm of your hand. I look for the clays I had saved for a face mask I never made. Pink clay. Red oxide pigment. A bit of gold mica to give a healthy glow. I add everything to the mortar. Nina’s particles mix with the color. And become anonymous. Undetectable. Harmless. Now it looks like real makeup. Like any blush sold in eco-friendly shops.

I sift it through a fine mesh so it’s completely smooth. The final texture is perfect. Soft. A warm, slightly earthy pink. The powder smells like clay and the lavender essential oil I added at the end. It no longer smells like her. At least not to anyone else.

To me it does. I know. I feel it. As if something in my skin recognizes what it is.

I grab an empty metal compact. I bought it online months ago without knowing why. Now I know. I pour in the powder. Moisten it with alcohol to compact it. Cover it with wax paper and press down hard with a flat object. When I lift the paper, the blush is solid. Whole. Perfect. A new body. The body of an object no one would suspect. Something that will pass through X-rays without question. Something that will travel with me in my carry-on.

Something that will touch my skin. Enter through my pores. Accompany me every day in a country where nothing will smell like home. I hold it under the light. It’s beautiful. It shines softly, a warm, living glow. I close the compact and hear the click. Final. Sealed. And I feel something like peace. A twisted peace. Twisted but mine.

But—  
what about her?  
That need returns, looping through my mind.

*What do I leave her?*

 

The idea returns with more clarity when I close the bathroom door. I look at myself in the mirror and think—without words yet—that the body always leaves something behind. Mine too. I’ve always been careful, obsessive about skin, about what falls, what sheds. And now all of that, everything I used to throw away, suddenly has meaning. Has purpose. It could be useful. For her.

I sit on the edge of the bathtub with a towel spread over my lap, the way artisans prepare before they begin. I’m not doing anything wrong; I’m simply sorting, collecting. It’s almost… scientific. If Nina’s fur can become makeup, then my own cells can become something useful, something I can “leave” for her. Something of me that can stay with her. Something that will comfort her when I’m gone.

I start with the simplest thing: the root of the hair. I lean my head forward and separate small strands. If I pull them close to the scalp, some come loose with that minimal, almost sweet resistance of dead or tired hairs. It doesn’t hurt. I tell myself it’s like a deep cleanse, like those routines dermatologists recommend to strengthen growth. A few fall onto the towel. Black, fine, shiny. Perfect.

The nails.  
I’ve always hated irregular cuticles. I get close to the mirror again and push the edge back with the wooden stick. The skin responds, docile, revealing those tiny transparent strips that, if gripped firmly, can peel off whole. And they do. It’s not blood, it’s not damage. It’s order. It’s cleanliness. I pick them up carefully and let them fall onto the same little growing mound of material. I think of Nina, how she sniffs my hands when I get home from class, as if she wants to memorize me. This is a concentrated version of that. A solid essence.

Hangnails.  
This part hurts a little. Just a little. A dry tug and the skin opens like a tiny zipper. A drop of blood appears and I wipe it with a tissue. I won’t use the blood in the salve, but the torn piece, yes. I tell myself calmly, as if following tutorial instructions: “If it bleeds, it’s fine. It just means new skin is underneath.”

The lips.  
I moisten them. Wait. Run my tongue over them again. The skin softens. It’s instinctive, really; how many times have I peeled little bits without thinking? This time I think too much. I take them between my nails, slowly, and pull. Tiny pink strips come away. I keep them all. One longer strip sends a shiver down my neck—half pain, half relief. I tell myself it’s deep exfoliation. People pay good money for this.

The towel now looks like a microscopic collection of human remnants: hair, dry skin, scales that shine like mica when the light hits them. There is no horror in it. There is order. Selection. Care.

I set out a small ceramic bowl where I mix my face masks and pour everything inside. I look at it. It is… mine. As mine as I am Nina’s. And if I’m leaving, she deserves something that tastes like me, smells like me, is me. Dogs understand the world through scent. She deserves a real piece of what I am, not a substitute.

The next step is to turn this into a fine, homogeneous powder. I open the drawer where I keep the mortar I bought for grinding seeds. I clean it with alcohol—I know how to be hygienic, I’ve always been hygienic—and pour the mixture in. I begin pressing, moving my wrist in slow circles. The texture shifts under the motion: first it crackles, then it crumbles, then it becomes a pale, soft dust.

A powder of me.  
A powder for her.

When I finish, I smell it without pressing my nose too close. It doesn't have a strong scent, but there is something… familiar. Patricia, my dermatologist, would say it’s the basic smell of keratin, sebum, epidermis. I would say it’s simply the smell of being alive. I’ll mix it with oils tomorrow. Not today. Today I just watch the small beige mound and feel calm. Even relieved.

I have something to give Nina. Something intimate, quiet, real. Something that will stay with her while I sleep far away.

I wake up before the alarm. Strange—I have… selective sleep. If I’m deeply asleep, no noise can wake me, but if someone says my name, I jump out of bed like a spring. I remember the powder I prepared last night and it calls to me from the bathroom, as if it were still warm between my hands. I could swear I dream about it. About Nina smelling it. Licking her paws after Mom or Aunt rub it on her little pads. With that reflexive satisfaction she shows whenever she finds something she recognizes as “mine.”

I put water to heat for coffee, but really I’m doing it so I have something that marks the beginning of the procedure. Every careful process needs a ritual, even a small one. This is no different from making homemade moisturizer, I tell myself. There are thousands of videos about it. I’m not doing anything strange; I’m simply doing it my way.

I go into the bathroom and turn on the white light again. The bowl is where I left it, covered with a clean cloth. The powder looks lighter this morning. More uniform. Beautiful.

I take a deep breath.

I open the small bottle of almond oil I bought for my hair. It doesn’t have a strong scent, and that’s important; Nina must smell me, not chemicals. I’ve seen people use coconut oil, but that solidifies, and I don’t want the salve to change texture in the cold weather we feel daily—things that happen living near a páramo. I pour a small amount into a clear glass jar. I like seeing its thickness. I like how it pours without hurry, obeying gravity with dignity.

With the handle of a wooden spatula, I carefully lift the powder. It’s so fine it looks like human pollen. It falls onto the oil in an almost invisible cloud. I stop to watch how the dark surface of the oil brightens with speckles, like a tiny suspended cosmos. I begin mixing.

Slow.  
Circular.  
Steady.

The consistency becomes creamy, just slightly grainy. Perfect to adhere to Nina’s paw pads, her muzzle, her ears if she sniffs it before lying down. I don’t want her to eat it all at once; I want it to become part of her routine, something she uses naturally. Dogs understand repetition. They feel safe inside it.

When the salve turns a uniform beige, identical to handmade foundation, I realize I’m smiling. Out of happiness. Because it has purpose. I lean in for just a second, just to check the scent. The mixture is faint, almost neutral, but there’s something beneath it—something any dog who loves me would recognize: old cells, skin oil, the intimate trace of what I am without perfume or soap. Something that says: I am here.

And although I know it’s ridiculous, it moves me to think that when Nina lies down to sleep without me for the first time, she might seek out this scent and feel calm.

I take one of my travel containers from the drawer: small, round, translucent, the kind used for moisturizers. It’s clean, dry, and it’s never held strong chemicals. I transfer the salve with a spatula, slowly, making sure I waste nothing. Every fragment, every drop, every pale golden smear is part of the gift. The jar fills almost to the top. I level it with a soft tap against my palm. I close the lid. Turn it twice, checking the seal. Then, with a fine marker, I write on the bottom a phrase that, if someone else sees it, will mean nothing: “Natural ointment – Nina.”

It’s not the product name; it’s the time of day I want her to use it. The night she misses me. The night I miss her too. The night we’ll both be alone but joined by something we share.

I find a small raw-cloth pouch where I keep cheap jewelry. I slip the jar inside. Pull the string tight. It feels light in my hand… but dense at the same time. As if it carried a carefully distilled secret. I catch myself stroking the fabric with my thumb. It’s absurd, but I feel like I’m touching something alive. What do I feel while I do it? There’s calm. A calm that’s almost frightening if I look at it too closely. I’m not nervous. I’m not impulsive. I’m not trembling. It’s different: as if all of this had already been decided before I even thought it. As if I were simply fulfilling an intimate duty. A natural duty.

Because Nina will miss me, yes. But now… now she’ll have something to keep her company. Something true. Something I can leave for her, as if my hands were still there when they’re no longer.

I stroke the pouch once more and place it in the drawer where I keep important things. Not valuable things—important things. I close the drawer with a soft click. And that sound, small and precise, fills me with a satisfaction so deep I’m surprised I hadn’t felt it before in my life.

I barely step away from the vanity when I hear Nina scratching at the door. She always does it when she feels I’m awake, even if I haven’t called her. I open it gently and she trots in, happy, with that wagging tail that looks like a laugh. I hug her. I kneel on the floor and she licks my cheek, then my hand. Her tongue is warm and urgent, as if she were afraid of missing a bit of me if she doesn’t touch me enough.

I look at her little ochre eyes, her white paws, her black nose, her long lashes, her tiny ears. God, I was going to miss her so badly. She doesn’t have her collar— it snapped one day, I can no longer remember how it happened. I keep her name tag with her info in my wallet.

**I’ve got it.** Again—like before, like that night. My eyes float loose in their sockets and the thought gains color, like an old TV shaking off its static. An immediate answer to a question I never asked. Bright, so obvious it feels strange I didn’t see it earlier.

What if she had a new collar that was truly mine? Truly ours? We never take her collar off—only for baths—and it’s for safety. I could make one that feels special, unique, handmade. And I’m very good with my hands. One that, when I’m far away, won’t just say “this is my dog,” but also “I am here.”

I catch myself stroking her neck as the idea sinks in.  
The perfect collar. Handmade. Made of me.

And without meaning to— or meaning it too much— I imagine how I could stain the fibers. I don’t want artificial dyes; they won’t last. I need something organic, something that can bind with her scent and mine, something that won’t wash away after the first rinse.

Blood works.  
It always works.  
It’s stable, personal, indisputable.

I rest my head against her body for a while as she breathes deeply, calm, trusting. No other creature has ever looked at me with this much truth. Maybe that’s why I don’t feel fear. Or disgust. Or doubt. Just this soft, warm, completely logical certainty: A collar for Nina, dyed with what I am. So she can carry me with her, even when I cross oceans.

I stand up. The idea is already planted.

Now I just have to execute the procedure with the same surgical care as the compact. And I’ll do it tonight. Slowly, precisely. I want everything to be perfect.

My grandfather went quickly after a long illness and my grandmother unexpectedly went soon after. The whole experience was traumatic. The hospital smells, sounds, surroundings, all of it. The 3 day funerals, serving people coffee while lifeless bodies lay in the other room. Asking them how they are and listening to their stories, while nobody asks about yours. My 13 year old little cousin was the reason I couldn’t show my grief. Not her fault, of course, but sometimes I feel resentful. Having to be at the hospital, while she couldn’t, hugging her tightly, while no one was hugging me. Making up a story of how our grandma was travelling all around the world, the cruises she was on, the people she was meeting, the flights she took, while actually her cold body was taken from place to place and finally ended up as ashes. In the story, of course, she was actually meeting our grandpa who had cooked her dinner and eating that dinner with her whole family. The month after grandpa passed, grandma started acting odd. I was there for the whole month, every day. I was there at the hospital, filing her nails and washing her hair. Sometimes I feel upset that I, at the ripe old age of 21, had to do things adults in my life should have done. I guess I’m an adult now too, but I still feel like a child. I wish someone hugged me tightly or made up a story to make me feel better. I wish I could cry in front of others. On the outside I act like an adult, but inside I am a child. A child that wishes she had the childhood my cousin is getting. I guess I wish I had adult me when I was a kid? I want my cousin to get what’s best for her, I want her to be happy, I want her to be healthy, I do everything in my power for that to happen, she’s like my little sister. I wish someone wanted that for me when I was her age. I resent myself for feeling resentful about her happiness, even though I am helping the cause of resent. I grieve everyday, I miss my grandparents everyday. I don’t show it because I don’t want her to grieve. I’m sure she does, but I don’t want her to.",1,1764721911.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

I am fairly attractive and can come off as confident but I am really not that social of a person and have never put myself out there that much.

She seems like a shy girl anyway, but I noticed that when she talks to me she seems to get even more shy and has even started blushing once or twice. She doesn’t seem to do this when talking to any of my other coworkers, even other men. I told myself that the next time I saw her I would try to give her a more direct compliment to see how she would react but I didn’t see her the last couple of days that I worked. Yesterday I decided to go to the sandwich shop next to my work and found out that she works there. I was caught off guard and didn’t say any more than I needed to and have been regretting it. I could tell by her expression and reaction that she definitely recognized me, but she didn’t say much either.

# Hello!

As i get older and older, i have less and less friends. Most of the people i used to hangout with online are the same age as me, and now have kids/spouses and in general a lot more going on in life then me. So i'm mostly just hanging out with myself! Which kinda sucks, tbh. So i'm just on the lookout for anyone that values spending time together, online. I miss sitting in calls, talking about whatever, watching stuff together on either discord screenshare, or plex. And just playing games in general. I have a ton of games, and i would love to play more. I'm not gonnas list any games since that's not the purpose of this post. This post is more to find someone that i can vibe with, someone i get along with. But it would be very good if you  played games.

But i'm gonna list some favorites of different kinds, so you somewhat get a feel for who i am?

* The movie Oldboy, been my favorite since it came out, so good.
* Bread. I do love bread, any type of bread tbh, it's not good for you but could easily live on it.
* Pepsi Max/Water/Coffee. I almost exclusively drink these 3 things.
* I do listen to a lot of music, but it's hard to describe? so heres my [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/zauron)
* Animals! An easy thing to love. I sadly don't have a cat anymore, but i'll adopt one soon again. I'm also very into Capybaras, they are amazing!
* Homelabbing. I have a \*erver which i tinker with a lot, running a bunch of services and just playing around with it, it's super fun!

That's some stuff atleast. I'm also kinda introverted, and my energy fluctuate quite a bit, so if i don't respond, don't take it personal!

Oh, and i'm located in Sweden. But any TZ is fine really, my sleep scheduele is all over the place!

I’m looking for the original Valk 3 (not power, elite, or any LEs), either magnetic or non-mag works. Also looking for a WeiLong GTS. I’m looking strictly for stickered versions of both with black plastic/internals only.

Are there any cube stores/websites that still have either of them in stock? Cubezz seems to have nearly every version of the Valk 3 except for the black stickered one I need. Same goes for the GTS - pretty much every other color of internals besides black. They do have a “Coffee” version of the GTS, the picture for which shows deceptively black-looking internals, but I have a feeling this version is actually dark brown or something like that. 

Does anyone know where I could find either/both of those cubes online? I’m working on a project to fully restore my collection of historic flagships, so any pointers in the right direction would be incredibly helpful.

1pcpezw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pcpezw/me_my_ex_and_the_other_guy/,"Me, My Ex and The Other Guy","Hello people.
I dont know how to really do this or really a reddit user but i need to talk about it somewhere so here i am.
If you are ready for a really long story, buckle up.

Me and my ex, we had a relationship on and off for almost 6 years.
He is 5 years older than me.
I seen other people but only had one proper relationship before him.
I fell head over heels for him like i never did before.I never thought i would be falling in love with someone like i did with him.
But we had many issues, we have been through some tough stuff that i cannot possibly  fit in this text, but maybe in a novel.
We done some crazy stuff (in a bad sense) for each other and to each other.

At one point i was struggling bad with my health mentally and physically, were going through a lot from my family and future, and i couldnt keep managing things with him because he is also mentally ill and he was going hard on me,
I ended up breaking up with him for couple of months once, which we never did and everything went downhill from there.
a lot of supressed trauma at that period caught up with me.
We both involved other people, which we both didnt know at the time.
I tried to get back with him, he had another girl in his life but didnt tell me about (they were just texting/flirting never met in real life nor never had a relationship) so i ended up chasing him.

We got back together, but things were really bad, he has been treating me really badly most of the time, barely showing love or even wanting to touch me but he still travelled because it was a long distance relationship.
He kept breaking up with me, telling me he doesnt want a relationship but he loves me.
And i lost my trust towards him (i caught many lies) and i got paranoid.

We kept trying for months and there was a moment things got a bit better, i told him i cannot deal with another break up and he still broken up with me.
Something in me, the person who was crying every night for him, lost my self in every sense, 
just stopped.
My tears, all the care i had flew away because i felt so unloved.
And i tried to talk to him many many times but never could get him to understand and also because he is struggling with the mental illness he has.

And i said i wont take no more.
And i met someone else by coincidence.
Someone else i wasnt really invested into but had fun time with 2 other friends at the same time.
He showed interest and we met few times.
He told me he never had a proper relationship before, and i also told him i am a kind of person who dates to be in a relationship and doesnt like situationships.
We kept seeing each other he told me about his feelings but we had disagreements.
Overall he made me feel better, like i was loved and for the first time in a long time i felt like someone actually wanted to be with me, and he was a good company and that gave me positivity in my routine which helped me get out of my depression.
He was also treating me very nicely and kindly and shown genuine interest in me.
We were in the beginning of building a relationship, but once we got intimate things had change.
I was his first intimate partner, i didnt know about it at the time but i tried my best to make him feel safe and good.
After that day, I felt like he lost his feelings and when i spoken to him he confirmed.I thought that it was because i have been with other people and he havent but he didnt clear that one out for me.
And after that conversation i decided we shouldnt see each other again because i dont like relations without emotions but we kept getting in touch.
He made it clear that “he doesnt wants to be in a relationship and we just hanging out”
I knew he didnt wants to get serious with me but i also really liked his company.
And at one point, we were acting like we were in a relationship and i couldnt help my emotions for him grow deeper.

He would act like he loves me, messages me all the time, always creates time for me and see me in every few days although he is a busy person with his job, makes sure to take me on coffee, movie, food dates.
Cant keep his hands off of me and tells me he misses me.
Doesnt sees any other girl but me.
But every now and then making sure he states he doesnt wants a relationship.

In meantime, my ex was reaching out to me telling me he regrets how he treated me and wants to try again.

So it confused me.
Also because i really loved my ex and i was just trying to move on with my life because i felt so unvalued and now my ex was really trying meanwhile i caught feelings for someone else that made me feel happier but also didnt want to be with me?

I talked to the other guy about the situation, 
He didnt believe me at first, showed a bit of jealousy and i tried to cut him off the same say thinking he didnt give any f. And he messaged me drunkenly few days later told me he was drinking with his friends and i came to his mind 

We started seeing each other again, holding hands going on dates but still the same situation.
I started to talking to my ex and i told the other guy i might give him a chance because i dont want to be in a situationship that i want to be in a relationship.
and he said he wants me to be happy and i should give my ex a chance because there is no future for us, he didnt say anything about his emotions at all.

We talked about this situation few times, he knew i was gonna give my ex a chance but was still making plans with me for summer etc.

Honestly i think the reason i told him was that i wanted to see if he was feeling anything towards me at all, that he was gonna tell me to stay but he didnt.
At last, when we met to see each other for a bit i told him that i am gonna see my ex soon to see how i feel for him and he told me we should stop seeing each other than and i agreed.
I couldnt stop a few tears of mine and to summarize what he told me “I will miss you too it is not like i am heartless but we both knew about our situation and we didnt have a future together”

I summarized it the best i can but there are many details missing dont get me wrong.

Now i am left here having weird feelings for two people, in a weird situation.
And i am supposed to see my ex, it feels easier going back to what i know and who i know, feels like i am gonna see an old friend i valued a lot.
And he is trying really hard for me now (although he still didnt say anything about having a relationship with me but that he just wants me back)
but i am kind of afraid the issues that will come with it.


And i am aware i have attachment issues and i need to work on myself too and i am trying to do that.
But i really feel like i f ed up and made it worse.
I think i just really wanted to feel loved and have a nice relationship with someone
Who we can keep each other company without the toxicity but i always end up being the one who loves, and not wanted to be in a relationship.

I dont understand if it is a guy thing? Any male human species would like to say their opinion about the feelings of these guys i d love to hear as i cannot comprehend or understand for the sake of it.

Other than that, i just needed to get it off my chest because i had the last meeting with the other guy.
My head was gonna explode.
If you made it this far, props to you for real and thank you.
I also would like to say sorry for any mindfks i have causen because this all feels like gibberish.
P.s i am not a teenager, sadly i am a grown adult that is 27 years old..

1pcpdox,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pcpdox/do_not_watch_this/,Do Not Watch This,"I’m writing this here now because I’m not sure when I’ll get another chance. I’m not sure I’ll live long enough to recount this event in its entirety. 

My name is Donavin Meeks. I’m 22 years old, and last month, I found a VHS tape. 

I had been rummaging through my attic, searching for some old Halloween costumes I could pull back out for old times' sake, just to get into the ol’ holiday spirit. 

I’ll preface by saying, much like many others, my attic was almost backroom-ish. 

The way the dust had collected amongst the clutter, and how the cobwebs seemed to decorate the beams that supported my roof, the atmosphere alone was unsettling enough. 

As I searched through box after box of old knick-knacks, photo albums, and stocking stuffers that nobody used anymore, I finally managed to find the cardboard box labeled “Halloween” with a little cutely drawn spider with a smiley face beside it. 

All hail the Gods of irony, because as soon as I lifted the box, the biggest black widow I’d ever seen came running out, its legs clicking against the hardwood.

I hate spiders, so this obviously caused me to jump backwards, tripping and falling over some other boxes and immediately flailing like a maniac in fear of a bite from the arachnid. 

Hopping to my feet and checking ferociously for any sign of the thing on any part of my body, I happened to glance down at the mess of boxes I had just created. 

Lying in the center of the scattered clothing and Christmas decorations, lie a VHS tape. 

Unlike the other items, the VHS tape was completely dust free, and seemed as though it had been watched to about the halfway point. 

I picked it up to analyze it and found that it had been labeled “Do Not Watch” in black permanent marker over white painters tape. 

Staring at the words, I couldn’t help but feel utter intrigue. 

Not only had I never seen the tape, I had never even OWNED a VHS player. 

I mean, I’m 22, honestly, what am I going to use one of those things for? 

The dams of curiosity broke within the first two minutes of my discovery, and off I went, down to the local pawn shop to find my VHS player. 

It cost me a solid $5.98. One of the perks of being obsolete, I guess.  Upon returning home, I was bewildered to find that the mysterious videotape was no longer on the coffee table where I had left it. 

Living alone, this turned out to be incredibly concerning to me. 

I began to rack my brain, thinking of how I could have misplaced the thing. 

I distinctly remembered placing it directly in the center of my coffee table. I mean, I checked under the couches, on the dining room table, my bedroom, bathroom, every room in my house had been checked. 

I began thinking that it was my mind that had been lost instead of that damn tape.

I stayed up into the early morning hours because the idea of something that distinct just vanishing like that; it irked me.

My mind already tends to wander and teeter on borderline paranoid schizophrenia, and this event did NOT help.

Once I finally DID choose to go to bed, my sleep was shakey at best.

I couldn’t have been asleep for more than an hour and a half when the abrupt sounds of what seemed to be footsteps awoke me.

I could have swore that I heard the sound coming from directly above me, yet, once I fully regained consciousness, they had stopped completely.

I had first put it off as a dream, a mere trick of the mind, similar that feeling you get when you’re falling in your sleep.

That thought gave me comfort, and allowed me to doze back into sleep. However, that comfort was quickly vanquished when the same sounds started up yet again.

This time I KNEW what I had heard, and I wasn’t about to just lay in bed defenseless.

I immediately threw the covers off of myself and grabbed the bat that I keep beside my bed in case of home intruders just like this one.

Being sure to make a lot of noise so the intruder KNEW that I was coming. I wanted them afraid, I wanted them to feel what I had been feeling.

I yanked the attic door down and began climbing the ladder, flashlight in one hand, bat in the other.

I hyped myself up as I ascended, preparing myself for whatever may lay within the plane of darkness which is my attic.

Once I got about 6 inches from the entrance, I called out.

“I know you’re up there! I hope you know I’m calling the cops, AND I’m armed. So just come on out please. Don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.”

I waited a few moments and received no response.

The silence was daunting, and cut through me.

The hot attic air seemed to grow chilled. A distinct drop in temperature that made me shiver.

“Just come on out, man. We can work this out just as soon as you come out and make yourself known!”

I waited a few moments once more, and once more, received no response.

“Alright, I’m coming up! I swear to God if I see any movement whatsoever from you, I am bashing your head in!”

I slowly began to ascend what remained of the ladder.

My right palm sweat profusely wrapped around the rubber grip of the bat, whereas my left hand shook the beam of the flashlight ever so slightly.

I began to scan the room with the beam, making sure light touched every surface possible from the attic entrance.

Everything seemed still. Calm. Untouched, if it weren’t for where the few boxes I had knocked over prior.

Though my light landed on no one, it did happen to fall upon a familiar plastic black rectangle, placed right back in the center of the spilled clutter.

“No fucking way…” I thought to myself.

Cautiously, I made my way towards the VHS tape, practically spinning in circles with my flashlight as I inched closer.

Still, no sign of an intruder.

I reached down and retrieved the VHS tape.

Just then, a whole wall of boxes came tumbling over from across the attic, followed by the sounds of swift footsteps that seemed to approach me at an inhuman pace, only to completely dissipate as soon as it was before me.

The flashlight and bat were both shaking wildly now as I spun around the room, sweating and petrified.

“COME OUT! COME OUT RIGHT NOW!” I screamed.

The attic was now eerily silent again.

As I stood there, shaking and on the brink of a panic attack, the sound of creaking floorboards scratched the back of my mind, and a deep, booming voice spoke from behind me.

“Boo.”

I flew across the attic at a speed I didn’t know I was possible of achieving,

I was down the ladder so fast that my foot ended up getting caught on the last rung, causing my ankle to twist, followed by a sickening POP that shot pain throughout my entire leg.

I had saved my videotape though, and this time, it wasn’t leaving my side.

I ended up having to spend the rest of the night and next morning in the hospital getting x-rayed and having my foot casted up.

I had ended up breaking my ankle, and all I could tell the doctors was I tripped while climbing out of the attic.

Anyway, I returned home as soon as I was cleared, anxious to finally watch this VHS that seemed to had randomly appeared in my home, as well as some sort of unwanted visitor.

I never really fed into the whole paranormal thing, but holy shit, man. The true horror that I felt in that moment up in that attic; it made me a believer instantly.

Well, I should say that it made me believe that things can be ATTACHED to objects. Whether it be holy or demonic. Attachments can happen.

And I believe that’s what the case was with this tape.

Once I arrived home, I was determined to finally view its contents.

Something that I had failed to notice upon retrieving the tape from the attic was that now, instead of being half way through, it was completely rewound to the very beginning.

Not only that, but the black marker had now been turned…red? It looked as though a completely new label had been placed on the tape. It looked…flashier. Like the CAUTION tag on a bottle of chemicals.

“DO. NOT. WATCH. THIS.”

Yeah, right. Who WOULD’NT watch this?

Arriving home, I found that my house had been completely trashed.

Cabinets were thrown open, couch cushions ripped off and strewn across the floor, pots and pans sat neatly across every counter top.

Luckily for me, my VHS player had remained untouched, and sat where it had been just below the TV stand.

Unbothered by the mess, unbothered by the clear red flags, I sat down in front of my television and popped the tape into the player.

Nothing happened at first. Just a black screen that lingered.

Suddenly, blasting white and black static came scratching across the display.

I jumped a bit, and felt my heart drop before steadying.

Slowly but surely, the picture began to become clear and smooth.

The first thing to come into view was a mailbox.

A mailbox that stood displaying my exact address.

My heart began to speed up again.

As the picture video became clearer, I was able to make out the sidewalk that led to my front porch.

Then my front door.

Then my stairs.

The attic door.

The ladder.

And then darkness as the person recording nestled into a dark corner within the attic.

The video then remained that way. Black stillness for an uncomfortably long period of time.

There was a sudden and harsh skip in the frames and now the camera was panned to the attic door from within the attic.

Distinct shadows could be seen through the cracks in the doorframe, shadows that seemed to be that of a certain 22 year old man, living alone.

There was another cut, and now the recorder appeared to be crouched in a new corner of the attic, filming as the door to the fell open and footsteps began to climb the ladder.

I watched in horror as my own head popped into frame, waddling up the stairs, completely oblivious, as I searched through box after box for a stupid Halloween costume.

The video then abruptly ended, right before the black widow came crawling out from under the package causing me to jump backwards and fall.

The next cut was a shot of my living room. It showed the camera slowly approaching the tape that lay on my coffee table.

Another sudden cut.

A hand was now in frame, pale and decrepit. It carefully placed my silver spaghetti pot atop the kitchen counter before patting it softly, then panning the camera around the room to reveal the mess that had been created.

The next and final cut revealed me, yet again, cautiously searching the addict with a flashlight. Eyes wide and apprehension painted clearly across my face.

I stared at the television in absolute dismay. Frozen. My jaw dropped cleanly to the floor.

I remained in a trance-like state for the remainder of the footage, broken only when the video abruptly ended, and was somehow replaced by live footage.

Live footage that showed a 22 year old man, who lives alone, sitting in awe, as he watched himself on the television.

My mind took longer than I care to admit for it to put the pieces together, but once it did, it was too late, and the sound of heavy footsteps began echoing from the television, and the live footage inched closer and closer to my spot on the sofa.",1,1764721352.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

# Hello!

As i get older and older, i have less and less friends. Most of the people i used to hangout with online are the same age as me, and now have kids/spouses and in general a lot more going on in life then me. So i'm mostly just hanging out with myself! Which kinda sucks, tbh. So i'm just on the lookout for anyone that values spending time together, online. I miss sitting in calls, talking about whatever, watching stuff together on either discord screenshare, or plex. And just playing games in general. I have a ton of games, and i would love to play more. I'm not gonnas list any games since that's not the purpose of this post. This post is more to find someone that i can vibe with, someone i get along with. But it would be very good if you  played games.

But i'm gonna list some favorites of different kinds, so you somewhat get a feel for who i am?

* The movie Oldboy, been my favorite since it came out, so good.
* Bread. I do love bread, any type of bread tbh, it's not good for you but could easily live on it.
* Pepsi Max/Water/Coffee. I almost exclusively drink these 3 things.
* I do listen to a lot of music, but it's hard to describe? so heres my [last.fm](http://last.fm/user/zauron)
* Animals! An easy thing to love. I sadly don't have a cat anymore, but i'll adopt one soon again. I'm also very into Capybaras, they are amazing!
* Homelabbing. I have a \*erver which i tinker with a lot, running a bunch of services and just playing around with it, it's super fun!

That's some stuff atleast. I'm also kinda introverted, and my energy fluctuate quite a bit, so if i don't respond, don't take it personal!

Oh, and i'm located in Sweden. But any TZ is fine really, my sleep scheduele is all over the place!

Hope to hear from you! take care :)",1,1764721317.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

1pcpca9,https://i.redd.it/nt04gxabuv4g1.jpeg,Made a Dry Out area for my special nerites that demand time out of the water.,"For years I’ve fought with my snails. Well my lightning bolt nerites specifically. The zebra never cared about being out of the water but the lightning bolts will always come up and out. At first I’d just put them back in the water but I could legit tell they were mad at me for that. So I stopped. 

I upgraded and got a good 10g aquarium (shrimp king by denerelle) with a good and tight glass lid. Keeps evap minimal. Shrimps like that. 

There was a hole in the lid so you can pick it up. They escaped thru finger hole. I tried specially made snail deterrents that looked like vasaline. Rubbed it around the hole. They laughed as they put their shell down and scraped it off the glass and kept going. Little scraping bulldozers they are. Had to use a cork. That worked. 

So I kept the cork on and they still spend a good deal of time out of the water.  Dropped the water levels down a few inches to give them some extra space to get away from the water. 

Parameters are great and well within ranges. I keep primarily shrimp (neo cardinia, with experience with brine shrimps, fresh water community, eels, frogs, etc) so the waters used are RO and proper remineralization. PH, GH, KH, ammonia, nitrates, nitrites, ppm, salinity, etc. 

This is just a quark of this certain breed it seems. I’ve read that some of these nerites are “tidal snails” and some of them want to dry out for weeks at a time! With this in mind I wondered if mine wanted to do this too. 

If I leave the cork OFF the hole, 80% of the time I’ll find them on the floor a day or two later. I fear it’ll get stepped on one day. I don’t want that. I’ve had them for years. 

Anyway, I was sipping coffee the other morning and got an idea. To work *with them and not against them. I figured a way to allow me to leave the hole open so they can get out of the humid tank air but remain contained in a way that dry air can dry them as they want but a screen would keep them from going off the edge and allow for a simple way back into the tank when they want. 

I made a cage of sorts using a new reusable coffee filter and some poster putty to keep it in place and keep the snails safe while they finally dry out properly. I installed it 3 days ago. 

Today when I came home from work I was elated to see one basking up in the air, safe and sound in its own little dry tank. 

Just wanted to share my story and experience. Can’t help but laugh that the idea is working and feel great to have finally found a compromise. ",21,1764721251.0,Aquariums,1,1.0,False

>Personally, I think we have some time to relax.



Fujimaru Ritsuka is surprised at Goredolf’s calm composure at times like this. Goredolf responds that it is natural for him to be like this as the head of the Musik family. He suggests that you go talk to the others.



**Goredolf:**

>I’d like to fully enjoy this intermission on my own. It is a luxury that the administrative and technical advisor is not here currently.

>Ah, besides—

>When we succeed in our operation, I have to think about what comes after we, Chaldea, save the world!

>Your actions were out of sympathy and guilt. Yet, you did not do it as a “saint”.

>But that is fine as well. Helping others out of sympathy and guilt—

>That is a very wonderful thing. A very human thing to do.

>That’s how I’ve been getting by these days. Food is power, though I don’t know who taught me that.



**Meuniere:**

>That’s unbecoming of a mage. If you have time for that, you’d be devoting it to your research…

>Speaking of, even the old man bakes bread… Could cooking be useful for mental discipline?

>Ah. I guess I’ll give cooking a try! I really just wanted to be a foodie!



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Putting the mental discipline aside.

>Cooking together sounds fun.



**Meuniere:**

>Put away that self-confident smile. Socializing is a lot harder than cooking.

>But when you’re the one suggesting it, it might be doable.

>You do have experience camp cooking as well. I’ll put it down on my bucket list.



**Elron:**

>My. I’d come along for a coworker hangout.

In the Storm Border hangar, we see that Sion upgraded the recharge sequence for the Imaginary Numbers Dive. Da Vinci and Mashu are now informed of this upgrade, and hopes that this will serve as a useful backup in the future. Mashu points out that existence verification numbers are vastly different from how they were originally. Sion is shocked by this and fixes it so that they won’t be repelled when they dive into the Imaginary Number Space. Sion says that this is all so that they’re prepared.



You enter and ask if both are prepared and ready to go. Mashu states that she’s been getting a lot of rest thanks to Goredolf. Sion says that they’re all in the green but everyone including Nemo aren’t going to get out of overtime just because they’re in the **acceptable range**.

Sion slips up that she’s a **former candidate for the head of the Atlas Institute**. She’s disappointed in herself for letting that slip. She explains that before they met in the Wandering Sea, Sion was next to succeed her father, Zepia, as head of the Atlas Institute. However, when she learned of the Bleaching Phenomenon, she decided to help Chaldea instead. In light of this, her father, Zepia, cut ties with her and her succession.



Sion has now experienced the joy of being free from the Atlas Institute. You ask why she chose to help Chaldea. Sion responds that she “**could**” and plus, she thought that chances like this are **very rare**, and wanted her own badge and increased personal value as well.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>I see, that’s very much like you, Sion.

>That’s a digital and straightforward reason.



**Sion:**

>My. I can be a bit naive too, y’know? I do have things I’m concerned about.

>For instance, the “Time Travel Problem” I explained earlier. I looked deeper into “the discrepancy in the time passed between the Bleached Earth and the actual Earth.”

>Preparing for the attack on CHALDEAS is vastly important, but personally, I’d like to be mentally prepared for an issue equivalent to that.



**Mashu:**

>.! The discrepancy in the passage of time… 

>Do you mean that there’s a difference between the days on the “Bleached Earth” and “the actual Earth”?

https://preview.redd.it/dfpq6cketv4g1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=bee25a889664ef8babe973c56ac98f3d8676ce91

**Sion:**

>Correct. How long a day is on the Bleached Earth is odd… No, more like it’s abnormal.

>In fact, there’s no cosmos “outside the Earth”. You can say that it’s as if this planet was isolated.

>Yet, morning, night, and the seasons. These didn’t happen under normal circumstances of the cosmos, but rather it was intentionally designed by CHALDEAS.

>In fact, TRISMEGISTUS II separately measured the “time on the Bleached Earth” and the “time on actual Earth”.

>If 2 years were to pass by on the “Bleached Earth”, it would actually amount to more.

>This is what me and Da Vinci-san have slightly come to expect from this.

>The passage of time on the Bleached Earth is abnormal. However, time still passes.

>Thus—when the Bleached Earth reverts back to the actual Earth, all that “accumulated time” will happen instantaneously.

>After returning to Earth, the year everyone comes back to might not be the year 2020.

>It’d be a time skip rather than a time slip.

>It is possible that the Earth in the future might have gone through some “forgettable years”.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>In other words, flying into a future Earth?

>Something like a Urashima Tarou?



**Sion:**

>Yep. That’s why I think it’s best for us to consider some countermeasures for when it happens…

>Well, this is mostly just an armchair theory. Like a “what-if” similar to that doomsday clock.

>I would like to ask you all to focus on the CHALDEAS assault for now.

>Chaldea is an organization that safeguards the future of Humanity. And I am merely a supporter helping Chaldea.

>Rest assured that me and TRISMEGISTUS II will prevent an end where all our efforts go vain☆

>Damn it, even the Marines are out! To think I’d be the only one here to do this!

Everyone who’s called for by Goredolf assembles back into the Control Room. However, Da Vinci is on a separate errand on her own. Nemo states that Da Vinci is in the engine room with Engineer, and cannot leave midway through the job.



Goredolf states that they detected an abnormal Saint Graph reading located on the ship’s deck. TRISMEGISTUS II states that this is an “**abnormal reading**”, but Goredolf believes otherwise, and tells the others to witness “them” for themselves. You and Mashu know who this shadow is.

Goredolf is screaming and asking what he’s seeing. Nemo confirms that they’re still flying and recalls all Marines for battle.



**Sion:**

>No. That won’t be necessary. Let’s keep the Storm Border as is.

>This is merely a giant Reality Marble. It no longer has the power to harm us.

>Isn’t that right, Romani Archaman? Or should I call you?

>Chaldea’s last contributor. Grand Caster, Solomon.



**Goredolf:**

>What!?



**Romani Archaman:**

>Refrain from speaking what lies beyond, bird of death. Whether I lend my aid entirely depends on you all.

>Come forth, Fujimaru. I will allow your accompanying Paladin as your escort.

>As acknowledgement of your recent feats, I will speak with you as equals.



Sion asks Nemo if they need spacesuits given the environment, but Nemo states that the atmosphere is sufficiently Earth-like to where Fujimaru just needs to wear his Mystic Code. You and Mashu are keen on going, but Goredolf is surprised that they’re going outside and asks if they’re really sure knowing there might be traps.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Yes.

>It’s because he appeared as Romani Archaman that I believe him.



**Goredolf:**

>—-



**Sion:**

>Indeed, you’ve got it backwards, Mr. Musik. I don’t think he’s a legit enemy if he’s wearing his mask.

>Romani Archaman was not a perfect human being. He had his strengths and weaknesses like any other person.

>There’s no merit for him taking on this form in battle.

>If there were any, there would be a very significant personal reason for this.

>Meaning…



**Mashu:**

>…He found some significance in Doctor’s life or how he lived it.

>That is why I believe he acknowledges Romani Archaman and followed in his footsteps.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Ah. That’s why—

>We must overcome this last trial here.

>Does this place not intimidate you? It seems your baseless foolhardiness knows no bounds.

>No, it has increased. I shall withdraw calling it baseless.

>I said this before. “I shall acknowledge you as an enemy when all seven Lostbelts were severed”.

>“Enemy” is a word that refers to a threat. At the time, you people were no threat to CHALDEAS.

>Thus I had no luxury of dealing with you all. I investigated the Lostbelts, and assessed the Humanity present there, and unraveled Marisbury Animusphere’s elaborate scheme.

>All of that has wrapped up. All that is left is to head towards Antarctica and stop CHALDEAS.

>Originally, this task was for me alone. However, this duty is bound to my very existence.

>The higher the success rate, the better. The more in numbers, the better. In other words—you understand what I mean here, no?

1pcpa8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditRats2/comments/1pcpa8h/i_am_that_person/,I AM That Person!,"Unfortunately, or fortunately, I AM that person! I am retired, I live in the Midwest and I’m in my late 70’s. I am NOT a cat lady although I do have 3 dogs. I live a very comfortable life in my manufactured home (2024 model) on 5 acres of land. I do have a basement (foundation +) just in case of a tornado. The entire site (including the home) cost me approximately $350,000. That being said, I guess K & R would consider me “trailer park trash.” I however do not! 


Reason I mention all this is because of the stereotype those two project as to us “rats.” 


Having worked all my life, I was able to retire comfortably with a lucrative pension and social security. I’m not rich by any means but I don’t want for or need anything at this point in my life.


To them, this may sound like an abysmal life. I don’t live on the beach (I mean c’mon, it’s the Midwest) but there is a spring fed creek just steps from my deck which is wonderful to listen to at night. And the wildlife……abundant! I’m working on making friends with a possum and raccoon! 

But it does get lonely! Lost my husband 10 years ago and my kids all live in different places. Their jobs require relocation so they move around a LOT! Whenever they have the time or chance, they visit. Usually for a week or so,  3-4 times a year. We FaceTime every other day though.


This snark page helps pass the time. Gotta admit, I became fully invested in it probably a year ago. Get up in the morning, make my coffee, feed the mutts and settle in for the Daily Trash. 🗑️ 


On more than a few occasions, I was SURE it was the final straw for these two!  And each time, just like a snake sheds its skin, they came out unscathed! 


Then the 6/19 situation and a few were claiming to have ring camera footage or videos (or seen them), pictures or absolute proof of a knife attack and other evidence of abuse. 


TO DATE, none of that has been provided! 


Heather came in like a wrecking ball, promising the moon and the stars. As quickly as she appeared, she disappeared. 

Eric has promised to provide proof if Kelly put his name in her mouth one more time…….yet nothing! 

I believe one of the mods said she saw the proof but far as I know, she’s gone. 


So forgive me if I’m a little jaded at this point because I believe, yet again, Kelly & Rick will walk away from this latest situation unscathed because no one is willing to “put up or shut up” and we will all just move on to the next debacle. 


I’ve started following a few other Snark & Tik Tok pages because until someone has the cahonies to take all this from “he said/she said” or rumor to TRUTH……it’s just too exhausting! 


I’m hopeful they will get what’s coming to them (legally & civilly) because I can’t think of two human beings more deserving than to finally be proven to be the utter and complete assholes they truly are! ",15,1764721098.0,RedditRats2,8,1.0,False

Some hide the slow unmaking of a life. Behind 1E lives a woman drifting through the fading corridors of her own mind, her memories slipping through her grasp like water she can no longer hold. The building watches her gently, almost with pity, as the past she once cherished dissolves room by room. Behind 1E, she slips away quietly, one moment at a time. Tonight, we step into the soft unraveling of a life forgetting itself.”

-1E-

She wandered the hallway of her apartment with slow, uncertain steps as one hand trailed along the wall like she needed it to hold her up. She whispered to herself as she moved.

“I was… I was doing something… wasn’t I?”

Her voice had a trembling, papery thinness, like she was afraid of startling her own thoughts into hiding.

The faint scent of something tugged at her nose. Something unknown. Something important. She followed it into the kitchen, sniffing the air, checking the sink, the fridge, even the trash can. 
Nothing.
She opened the fridge again, checked the sink, the fridge again and the trash can. 
Nothing, still.

A knock startled her so sharply she clutched her own chest.

She opened the door to reveal a broad shouldered and gentle eyed man standing in the entrance of her apartment.

“Oh, sweetheart,” she said, soft and relieved. “You came home so fast.” 

He blinked, offering a sad smile. “It’s just me, ma’am. The super.”

Confusion flickered across her face like a shadow passing a window. Her words stuttered, afraid and apologetic. “Oh. Yes. Of course. I knew that. I just…something smells strange. I can’t find it.”

“I’ll take a look, ma’am.” he said kindly, stepping inside.

She followed him anxiously, hovering in doorways as he checked vents, pipes, and corners. Then he moved to her bedroom as the woman lingered behind him. 

“What does it smell like?” he asked, crouching by the bedroom vent.

She opened her mouth, and paused.
“It’s… I don’t know anymore,” she whispered. “It was something. Something from… somewhere.”

He stood, brushing off his hands.
“I don’t smell anything,” he said with regret in his voice but a soft smile curled on his face as he spoke to her gently. “But I’ll come back tomorrow. I’ll check everything here again and also the vents in the empty unit next door too, alright?”

She nodded gratefully.
“Thank you, sweetheart. It’s so nice to have you home.” 

He didn’t correct her this time.

When he left, the quiet swallowed the apartment. She drifted toward the back hallway, whispering the shapes of rooms under her breath as she pointed to each one in order. 

“Bathroom… hall closet… spare room… where was I…”

Then she stopped.

The tall, darkened doorway frame that led into her spare bedroom loomed in the short distance from her, but someone was standing in the frame. Not clearly. Just a silhouette. Her breath hitched. Not in fear, but in recognition.

“Is it…is that you?” she whispered, voice trembling with hope. “Baby…?” She stepped closer to the door.
“Son?”

The figure slipped into the room without sound, and she followed, drawn by something deep in her bones.

The moment she stepped through the doorway, the room changed.

The beige carpet brightened into blue carpet, the one that he had her and his dad install when he was twelve. The ribbons of accomplishments and the posters of half remembered bands appeared tacked onto the white plaster walls. A suit jacket hung on the door.

And he was there, beautiful, alive, standing in front of the mirror with nervous, fumbling hands trying to fix a tie.

“Mom,” he said, laughing lightly. “I can’t get this stupid thing right.”

She felt tears gather instantly as motherly instincts took over and she moved over to stand before the frame of her son. 
“Oh…oh, sweetheart, here. Let me.”
Her hands moved automatically, fixing the knot like she’d done a hundred times before.

He swallowed hard. “Thanks mom.”
He let out a long breathy sigh that seemed, at least to her, to hold more weight and a lingering hollow feeling hidden within it.
“This is it, mom. I’m leaving.”

“What? Leaving? Son, what are you…what do you mean?”

He touched her arm gently, smiling through something she couldn’t understand. “I have to go.”

The form of her son hugged her, released, and walked toward the doorway as his edges began to break apart. He smiled. That same smile that he had given her so many times when she had him in her life. The kind that says, “I love you,” without any words needed.
His shirt faded first, then his hands, then his face.
He gave her one more soft, heartbreaking look, and vanished.

The room dissolved around her like melting paper. She blinked. She was alone in a dim spare bedroom she barely recognized.

“What…what was I doing in here?”
Her voice was small.

She backed into the hallway when the smell of saltwater pushed past her. The sounds of gulls calling through breezy air and the subtle crash of waves started to etch their echoes around the room. She turned toward a framed photo on the wall. One of two young women laughing at the beach. She stared at the picture feeling cool wind and warm sun beams on her skin when, suddenly, a hand rested gently on her shoulder. She turned.

A woman in her mid thirties stood beside her. She was vibrant and lovely wearing a huge straw hat, a yellow sunflower patterned sundress and huge mirror framed sunglasses that reflected the image of the older woman. 
Her best friend.
The old woman stood there, looking at her, sunlit and smiling, the way she always was and always would be to her, when she was in her thirties. “It’s beautiful here, isn’t it?” the image murmured. The older woman’s breath shuddered.

“I miss you,” she whispered. “I…I have missed you. Where did you go?” Her friend nodded softly. 

“Oh no baby, I didn’t go anywhere. I was here. Just buried in so much noise that it took me this long to cut through it all and see you one last time.”
They both gave each other an embrace that felt like reuniting and never leaving all at once. That is until the words her friend just said bent back around to the forefront of her mind.
“One last time? What do you mean?” She said, hands still gripping her friend as she pushes back seeing her reflection again in the sunglasses hanging on her face. 
“Sadly, I can’t stay. And neither can you my dear. You have to go back, and I…well I just have to go.”

“What do you mean? Go where?”

“I’m sorry,” her friend whispered, the voice already fading. “I don’t want to, but I must go. And you do too.” The sunlight dimmed. The warmth dissolved. The beach unraveled.

She blinked, and the photo in her hands was empty. Empty of meaning. Just a frame with nothing inside. Nothing inside that she remembered. 

She stood inside the hallway holding a meaningless trinket that didn’t even garner a longing glance from her eyes as a new scent reached her next.
Coffee, strong, warm, familiar. A tall, trembling shadow passed through the kitchen doorway.
Her heart lurched, as she placed the frame that pictured someone she didn’t know down on the end table. 

“No,” she whispered. “No… it can’t be…” She steadied herself on the wall, shuffling toward the kitchen, guided more by fear than curiosity. She turned the corner, and the room shifted.

Her husband’s favorite mug was on the counter. The old coffeemaker sputtered softly. He stood there, aging face full of love and sadness.

“Honey,” he said warmly. “Sit down. I’ll make you a cup.”

She obliged him, she always did and she collapsed into the chair like it was the only solid thing in the world as he walked slowly over to bring her a fresh cup, setting it on the table beside her.  He knelt down next to her, taking the hand of his one and only love into his. 

“I need to tell you something.”

She swallowed, nodding.

“I loved you. Have always loved you. Every day. From the moment we met, to our wedding, to the day our son was born. Through everything. Even after the world took him from us. Took me away from you.”
Her lip trembled. “Loved? Do you not, right now? Love me?”
He glanced with a smile at her saddened expression holding a smile she remembered from a half faded memory. “Oh honey,” he said softly, “I have loved, love, and will love you always. Even when there isn’t a remnant of me that remains, my love will.” 
They both stared in each other’s eyes for a solid beat of time. Their ageless longing for each other never subsided and never wained. Yet, his next impulse was not his choice, he had no decision to make here, only the act. He stood, “But now, my love, I must leave you. Even though I wish nothing more than to stay.”
“Then don’t go,” she begged. “Please don’t go.”

His thumb brushed over her fingers, warm, familiar, heartbreaking.

“I have to,” he whispered. “And soon you won’t remember I was even here, or why this hurts to begin with.”

“No, if you leave me…I…how will I find you? How would I ever learn to live without you?”

He kissed her hand one last time.

“Baby,” he hesitated as he stood and looked at her, as if trying to take in all of her, every molecule, “I’m not even here now sweetie.”

“I’m…I don’t understand.”

His outline thinned.
His eyes faded.
His voice disappeared.
And the kitchen snapped back into the dim, modern space she lived in.
She stared at a cold coffee mug covered in a thin layer of dust that sat on the table.

“Why… why am I crying?” she whispered, touching her wet cheeks with shaking fingers. She began wiping them away, with no recollection of even why they were there in the first place. 

As she sat rubbing her palms down her cheeks she immediately froze with her hands halfway between her eyes and jawline. The smell that coalesced in the air fired off neurons in her brain bringing forth a long dormant memory. She couldn’t connect the dots in her weary mind of why it was here but she knew every particle of the scent and exactly from what place it belonged to.

It was floral, it was sweet and it was covered in love as it floated past her, filling her nostrils as if begging her to come find it. 

She slowly rose from the chair in her barren kitchen and walked out into the living room. The space did not resemble the current drab living arrangements of her own apartment but instead looked like a memory long pushed into recesses so deep that the sight of her new surroundings felt like an old lover wrapping her in a warm embrace. 

Warm firelight flickered on polished wood floors. Flowers glowing with color in pots arranged on the mantle and window sills brought a bursting of color to entire room. The memory took shape as the space that once occupied the area slowly gave way to the powerful image of where she was, had been, and held steady and exact. 
 
A cottage.
Soft. Safe.
That long forgotten place.
Home.

Standing behind a brushed brown colored couch were the vague silhouettes of far forgotten outlines of people she couldn’t quite place. Frames of vapor that seemed to hold shapes of only ages. Young, vibrant, loving. They stood without motion…watching her, waiting.

She walked over, stood tentatively before the outlines, squinting her eyes as if trying to gain an inkling of a reminder of what they are, who they are, or were, or should be. She blinked rubbed her eyes and felt her body ache and turned slowly before the feeling of fatigue grabbed her and she took a seat with a sigh on the sofa. Her hands stretched over the fabric of the cushions the material edging around her fingertips as a smile found its place. She hadn’t sat here in so long but she knew every detail. 

Then, delicate, soft footsteps interrupted the somber remembrance. 
A presence warm like sunlight entered the cozy cottage from a life she once knew. 
A beautiful young woman stepped from the shadows.
Confident.
Alive.
Gentle.

“Hey there, sweetheart,” it said softly. “I’m here.”

The old woman’s lips parted.
“I… I know you. I’m…you’re…me?”

“That’s right,” the younger self whispered, kneeling in front of her. “Hey there, lovely.”

She took the old woman’s hand in both of hers. She clasped them ever so gently before looking up to meet her own gaze. 

And then she spoke.

“Hey… look at me. I’m right here. I’m the last piece of you left, you know. Everyone else…the memories, the people, the moments you loved…they’ve already gone.
And now it’s just us. Just you and me. I wish you hadn’t had to grow old without them.
Without me.
I didn’t want you to carry everything alone. But you did. For so long. Longer than any heart should have to.
You’re scared.
I know.
But you’ve been scared for years, haven’t you? Trying so hard to hold on when your own mind kept turning against you. Your memory failing you piece by piece…like an ever present, slow moving coup,
quiet and patient, taking your life one room at a time while you stood there helpless.
Trying to remember faces that should’ve been impossible to forget. Trying to stay here…even when here stopped making sense.
I’m sorry.
I’m so, so sorry you had to do all of this by yourself. You don’t deserve this kind of ending. This slow unmaking. You deserved warmth, and company, and someone to tell you it’s alright when the lights go out. But this is where we are.
You and me, in the last quiet corner of your mind.
And…I need you to hear something.
When I go, there won’t be anything left to fear. There won’t be anything left to hurt you. There won’t be anything left at all.
But you won’t feel alone.
I promise.
There will be nothing left inside you to feel lonely with. Please don’t cry…you’re forgetting me already.
See? You’re looking right through me. I’m fading even as you try to hold on.
You weren’t supposed to watch me disappear. I was supposed to be the one who lived. Lived on through you. But it’s all going backwards now.
When I’m gone… you’ll be safe. Empty, but safe.
And I hope…
God, I hope…
some small part of you remembers that someone once loved you. Even if it was only me. Even if it was only the girl you used to be.”

The figures behind her faded first, softly, quietly, like dust settling.

Then her younger self, her last memory, the last bit of her, 
smiled through tears and whispered, “Goodbye, sweetheart. I love you.”

And she dissolved like smoke blown apart by a breeze.

The cottage room snapped back into her dim apartment. The old woman sat alone on the floor, tears streaking her face.
She looked around, confused.
Lost.
Hollow.

“Why…why am I…here?” she whispered.

Then, softer:

“Who…who am I?”

Her voice broke into a small, frightened whimper. She covered her eyes with trembling hands, rocking in the silence. And only the apartment held her, empty, quiet, waiting, as the last of her faded into the dark.

“In the end, the tenant of 1E doesn’t leave, she simply disappears, one fading thought at a time. There is no finale to a mind unraveling, only the soft collapse of everything that once held her together until even the collapse goes quiet. When the last of her slips away, the building exhales and closes the door behind her. Another life reduced to gentle, devastating nothing, and added to the ever growing ledger. Next week, we climb to Unit 5C, where forgetting is a mercy the tenant will never be granted, because his memories don’t fade. They fight back.”

I am a 21 year old male with all my teeth intact. I live a healthy lifestyle. I brush 2 times a day and floss every day. I also use mouthwash and a tongue scraper and whitening strips occasionally.

I am borderline obsessed with keeping my teeth perfect. It is really important to me, because A. I like being clean and i really value my white teeth B. I hate needles so much if it’s not an important vaccine or a life threatening issue I legit can’t do it, I pass out every time. The sight of them triggers my fight flight or freeze instincts.

I had never gotten a cavity in my life, and I eat really well. Lots of water too. Don’t drink alcohol except holidays really. Don’t drink coffee. Don’t vape or smoke.

Last dentist visit, and now I magically have 4. All near the same place. I trust the dentist too, I can see the cavities if I look hard enough and I can feel them with my tongue. 

I’m beyond frustrated. I know it isn’t actually a big deal and many people have dozens throughout a lifetime. But to me it’s really upsetting. I put a lot of effort into not letting this happen my entire life.

Before anyone says, it’s not genetics. My family has really good teeth. My siblings have all never had cavities.

Is it selfish to bring children into a world that we're actively destroying?

They'll inherit:

\- water scarcity

\- mass displacement from climate refugees

\- food insecurity

\- economic instability

\- ecosystems collapsing in real time

And they didn't choose any of it. We chose it for them.

I know people say ""humanity has always faced challenges"" or ""kids are resilient"" or ""we need the next generation to fix it"" But none of that changes the fact that we know what's coming and we're choosing to create new people who will suffer through it. Is that fair? Is that ethical? Or is it just human nature to keep going regardless of circumstances?

I'm not saying people who have kids are bad. I'm genuinely asking: how do you reconcile the desire to have children with the knowledge of what kind of world they'll grow up in? I was sitting outside last night with a coffee, thinking about this and I honestly don't know where I land.

So what's the answer? Is it selfish or is it just part of being human?",11,1764720574.0,TooAfraidToAsk,28,0.59,False

1pcp1iz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcp1iz,Just fully automated Black Coffee/Tea only menu in diner layout!!! (PC),"This is legit about six plus hours worth of frustration and getting through a full franchise to start over again. *THERE ARE MODS USED FOR THIS* I DO have a tendency to use primarily Grabbers even when you CAN use a conveyor.

Active Cards (5 Franchise):
Black Coffee (obviously)
Exclusive
Closing Time
Instant Service
Individual Dining
Conveyors (although I use the Stuff on Demand MOD so this is a moot card but it was better than my other option)

Tea Pots
Magic Spring (I am unsure if there is another source that will auto give water, so at minimum on demanding this is a must if you choose to do two tea set ups like I did.)
Tea Pots
Booking Desk
Danger Hob
Composter Bin

Tips for running this:
Once this is up and running the only minor issue I have found I ran into is sometimes struggling to get the Tea Cups to dish out evenly with the automation. As I stated, without Mods you can squeeze between the Tea Bags and the conveyor/grabber so if you choose to keep a second cup table you can get cups delivered to the bottom two tables. With this set up your two main focuses are going to be on the Booking Desk and the Composter. There are only 5 Bar Stools used for seating, so Affordable can absolutely help with moving people along. If you use on demand, doubling up on Exclusive and Affordable will help IMMENSELY as table patience doesn’t go down with lines and there’s also the decreased eating time; this makes serving 38+ groups with only five tables super easy. If you’re like me and max out your Booking Desk line, then you can focus primarily on moving the trash to the Danger Hob every ten items. If you choose to have the spare Tea Cups table, you have to keep a close eye on both those bottom two tables AND the trash because if trash gets backed up, good luck getting your cups there. But if you’re holding a cup and need to drop it, you can also squeeze through the Tea Bags and Rotating Grabber to drop it with the main cups table.

Not an uneventful calm, however; the building of tension in the prose and a sort of rythmic foreboding underlines all. The violence of action, when it finally comes, is a relief.","The sixty-four came under the Bellona's lee, and in his strong voice Jack said, 'Captain Duff…there lie the French two-deckers. Let us attack them directly; and while we are bearing down let us at least have a bite and a sup. I shall tackle the pennantship, if you and Thames will look after the other.'

'Very happy, sir,' said Duff, smiling, and his crew gave three cheers.

Before going below Jack gave the Aurora, Camille and Laurel orders to maintain a discreet watch on the transports and their escort between the islands. He had every hope of snapping them up with neither damage nor casualties if he were successful in the bay.

A spirit-stove and a willing mind can do wonders, even in a heavy sea with a full gale blowing, and Jack Aubrey, leaving Stephen to carry their coffee pot down into the cockpit, came on deck again warm and well-fed.

He was wearing his usual rig: an old uniform coat, threadbare brass-bound hat that had turned many a cut, a heavy cavalry sabre by way of fighting sword, boots and silk stockings (much better in case of a wound). He glanced along the decks, all in the perfect battle-order Captain Pullings knew so well: over to the other side of the bay, where the Thames was making good progress: towards the Frenchmen, who for their part had moved from the island towards what seemed to be a cloudy village on the south side, where they lay a-try, perhaps with a kedge out ahead.

The Stately was keeping a cable's length astern, coming along under the same close-reefed topsails with the same air of competence.

'Shipmates,' said Jack in a conversational voice, but one that carried well over the roar of the wind, 'we are going to attack the pennant-ship from to-windward, while Stately goes on to deal with her companion. I am going to engage so close that our round-shot will go through both her sides, to end it quick. And be damned to him who first cries Hold, enough.’

A very hearty cheer indeed, echoed from the Stately: and the waft from the match-tubs by each gun drifted in eddies, a scent surpassed only by powder-smoke. Yet the Thames had not answered the cheer, though she was no great way off on the southern side. Jack took his glass: she was in trouble: she had contrived to get inshore of a reef and she could neither turn nor advance.

The first ranging shot from the Frenchmen splashed alongside. The next came home, somewhere about the larboard hawse-hole.

Tom yawed just enough for the forward starboard guns to reply, and now, in spite of the wind right aft, there was the scent of powder-smoke as well.

How quickly those last few hundred yards fleeted by! At one moment you could still notice a gull or that damn fool of a Thames, and the next you were in the full deafening roar of battle yardarm to yardarm, the broadsides losing all unity and merging into a continuous iron bellow. The ships ground together as the Frenchmen tried to board, yelling as they came. They were repelled; and now came a louder, more triumphant cry, then another as the enemy's mizzen went by the board at deck-level, carrying the maintopmast with it.

The ship could no longer lie head to wind and she slewed to larboard; but still answering her helm she ran north-east along the shore, keeping up a fire from her undamaged side until, at the very height of flood, eleven minutes after the first shot, she struck, racing high on to the rocky shelf just below the village.

Jack rounded to and called upon her to surrender; and this, after a moment's hesitation, she did. Even if she had been able to bring a gun to bear, which she could not, lying at that dreadful angle on the rock among the surf there was no hope.

Yet so far down the bay and in these shallows, the surf was far less dreadful than it looked. The quarter-boats brought the French commodore and his officers across with little difficulty, and carried a prize-crew back, including, at the Frenchman's most earnest request, Stephen Maturin, their own surgeon having been killed - he had wished to see a battle. A nominal prize-crew, and as a last thought a small party of Marines, for even if he had imagined trouble aboard the prize Jack had no time to spare.

Below the racing cloud he had just seen Stately attempt an extremely brave but perilous manoeuvre, drawing ahead and suddenly tacking across the Frenchman's bows to rake her fore and aft with broadside after broadside. But his ship or his men's skill betrayed him: the Stately would not come round. She hung there in irons while the Frenchman pounded her, knocked away her main and mizzen topmasts, and then she fell off to her former starboard tack. The enemy of course bore up and raked her in his turn.

But for the Bellona's approach he must have destroyed or taken her. As it was he let fall his courses and raced close-hauled to the end of the southern headland and out to sea beyond it, just saving both masts and sails, and disap-peared, steering eastward and increasing sail without the least care for his friends in their secluded cove.

The reason for this headlong flight appeared a moment later, when two English seventy-fours and a frigate appeared round the northern cape. Jack signalled them to heave to, emphasizing the order with a gun, told Tom to look to the Stately, and if she could be left, to make the best of his way towards the troopships' cove, and so dropped into Ringle.

I drink my coffee black and I do red eyes (shot in the dark for you west coasters) and I rarely use it for lattes or anything with milk. I also just like a good espresso by itself. I’m trying to narrow down the machine to something around (preferably under 1k) and I’m thinking I need to really focus on the grinder too. 

I’m definitely interested in getting into weight, pressure and all the ways to dial it in but my machine currently does not have those options. My end goal is to get comfortable with the process and then splurge on an LM. Any recommendations from folks who can get cafe level espresso around this budget? ",2,1764719770.0,espresso,10,1.0,False

# 🧪 Beta Disclaimer & Known Bugs

Yep, it’s beta. Yep, bugs exist. Here are the main ones:

* ⚪ **Random gray screen** after tapping certain notifications. Not always, and it disappears if you just go back into the app.
* ⚪ **Chat messages notify everyone — including you** 🤦‍♂️ Will be fixed ASAP.
* ⚪ **Error message when joining a lobby** You’ll get the same error message whether:
   * you haven’t added the required friend code yet (normal), **or**
   * you’re already in another lobby (less normal). Just quit your current lobby and you’re good.
* ⚪ **No “forgot password” feature (yet)** Yeah. I got too hyped adding real features and completely forgot that one. It’s coming this week — for now, just… don’t forget your password 😂.

# 📲 How to Install the Beta

**5. Bike radar (Garmin/Wahoo)**

Honestly one of the best safety upgrades after a helmet.

**6. A professional bike fit**

I believe I even took a sip of my coffee before driving through the stop. 

The officer was super nervous. Dropped his stuff as he handed me the ticket!

In the course of our interaction, he said that the “car camera” saw me roll the stop. I want that footage. Can I get it before my court date?

1pcoh33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1pcoh33/your_ad_creative_fails_because_you_violated_the/,Your Ad Creative Fails Because You Violated the Rule of One (Here's the Fix),"Eighty percent of ecom brands destroy their own conversions before the customer even clicks.

The issue isn't your creative quality. It isn't your budget. It's confusion.

You are cramming everything into one ad. Every benefit. Every use case. Every possible customer. This weakens your message to the point of invisibility.

I've analyzed hundreds of ad accounts doing between zero and three hundred thousand per month. The pattern is brutal and consistent.

The Confusion Trap

Your ad mentions brain fog, back pain, and menopause in the same creative. Three different problems. Three different customers.

What happens when someone only has menopause but no back pain or brain fog? The other two points create noise. Noise destroys trust. Trust is the only thing that converts.

You think you're being comprehensive. You are actually being forgettable.

The Rule of One: The Only Framework That Scales

One avatar. One desire. One message.

This is not theory. One creative following this rule generated over a thousand sales. Same creative. Multiple niches. The framework is transferable because it exploits how belief is formed.

Here is the breakdown.

Avatar Specificity (The Real Definition)

Most people think they niche down. They don't.

""I target women who are thirty five plus who struggle with knee pain"" is not an avatar. That is a demographic. Broad and useless.

A real avatar looks like this: Sarah just got out of knee surgery. Wasted two thousand on physical therapy that didn't work. She wants a holistic solution that fits her routine. She used to ice skate with friends but can't anymore. She fakes not being in pain in front of colleagues when she walks to the coffee station.

That is high intent. That is specific emotional pain plus failed attempts plus daily habits.

Your ad must speak to this one person. Not Sarah and John who plays golf. One avatar per creative.

Desire Depth (Stop at Surface Level and You Lose)

Surface desire: I want to look better.

Real desire: I want to turn heads at my reunion so my ex realizes what he lost because I want to feel desired and wanted again.

Everyone wants to be loved. Your ad must connect to the core driver, not the obvious outcome.

True Classic is a brand doing over a hundred thousand per month selling shirts. Their hook is ""when you wear this you're definitely getting a second date."" The desire isn't looking good. The desire is attracting the opposite gender. Their visuals show men with belly fat transforming into men their wives want.

Avatar plus desire creates congruence. Congruence creates belief. Belief creates conversions.

Message Consistency (Where Eighty Percent Fail)

Your pickup line worked. The customer clicked your ad. Then they land on a general product page that mentions the knee brace but not their specific knee pain scenario.

The emotional journey is broken. They cannot relate anymore. They leave.

Congruence across the funnel means zero friction. The ad talks about Sarah's knee surgery recovery. The landing page opens with a headline about post surgery recovery. The testimonials mention physical therapy failures. The product images show someone Sarah's age doing Sarah's activities.

One avatar. One desire. One message. From ad to checkout.

Why This Actually Matters for Testing

When you plan your ads using the rule of one, your feedback loops tighten instantly.

You know what is working and what is not because you isolated the variables. This avatar with this desire on this landing page either converts or it doesn't. No confusion about why.

You can iterate faster. You can scale winners harder. You stop throwing creatives at the wall hoping something sticks.

The alternative is continuing to blend five customer types into one ad and wondering why your cost per acquisition is trash.

Fix the avatar. Fix the desire. Fix the message. Do it now.",3,1764719023.0,dropshipping,0,1.0,False

1pcoek1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HearingAids/comments/1pcoek1/24_hours_and_already_a_profound_impact/,24 hours and already a profound impact.,"Hi all, 

Just wanted to share my immense joy with those who can relate. 

I collected my new hearing aids for middle ear ""hidden"" hearing loss yesterday and I just want to cry with happiness, grief, overwhelm and just awe. 

I was struck in the left side of the head/jaw in 2021 at work resulting in almost losing consciousness and white vision with rainbow sparkles for almost 30 minutes. 14 hours in hospital, released early and no imaging I was sent on my way with a pamphlet on TBI. 

Light, noise, nausea, memory issues, emotional regulation etc all in the middle of COVID lockdown and working from home did not make for easy healing but after 3 months things started to make an improvement, although external and overwhelm in loud or busy environments became a new feature of my life. I had a TMJ issue that took 18 months to also resolve and whilst receiving therapy for that continued to feel like there was a ball or mass stuck deep in my ear, I couldn't quite articulate it and so was sent for a hearing test. 

I was told that I have ""normal hearing loss for someone my age"" 31 at the time and that no indication it came from the injury at work but rather irritation from playing music in higher levels over years has influenced my brain to react unnecessarily to high pitch, loud noises and unexpected sounds as physical pain. 

Great. 

No solution. 

For the past few years I've struggled with even my own head voice feeling too loud in conversations. Constantly mishearing people, struggling in public, overwhelm amongst friends, having more meltdowns, feeling on edge, being told I'm too loud, keep my voice down etc it's been exhausting. I've lived in my loops and noise cancelling headphones to avoid dogs barking, kids squealing, lawn mowers, the dryer and coffee grinder or the car indicator and traffic signal lights sounding off. 

I truly did not realize how exhausting it has been to mitigate, soundproof and/or mask my discomfort and pain for so long ..... Until a conversation and follow up test resulted in some answers. 

Whilst under the surface of the injury I've now come to learn this year I have a few intersecting autoimmune illnesses, family history of hearing loss in the left ear, potential EDS and recently diagnosed with SN RA and treatment for MCTD. I also have PMDD and so a few times a month noise is unbearable.....but, I feel finally validated that an incredible, knowledgeable professional listened to me, mapped my history and saw the larger picture. 

It's day 2 and I can turn the world down and have control over how I and my brain processes my every day. 

I cannot even begin to wonder how many people are in a similar position, neurodivergent or not. Injury or not, genetic or birth defect, environmental impacted hearing loss, infection/illness etc 

I hope you advocate and continue to fight for your own body and health! I hope you trust your lives experience and know what's best for you and how you navigate the world AND for those those yet to get a breakthrough or still searching I'm sending you so much support and energy!!!

(Real-time teammates finder for any game — Nintendo, PC, Xbox, PS4 coming soon)

Hey everyone!  
A lot of you have been waiting for the beta release of DingPlay, so here it is. I’ve been working solo on this project for a month now, using Flutter and Firebase and I’m finally ready to let you try it out and break it (gently 😄).

# 🎮 What DingPlay Does (right now)

# ✅ Find the perfect teammate for any game — in REAL TIME

Create or join lobbies instantly.  
Each lobby has its own real-time chat so you can coordinate on the spot.

# ✅ Instant notifications for everything

* A friend invites you to a lobby? → You get notified
* Someone wants to join your lobby? → Notified
* New messages in your lobby chat? → Notified Everything happens instantly.

# ✅ No more sharing friend codes on social networks

Stop posting “Here’s my friend code, add me pls 🙏”.  
DingPlay handles platform IDs automatically and in real-time inside the app.

# ⭐ Cross&Play (experimental)

Enable Bluetooth → DingPlay scans nearby users.  
If you share games in common, you instantly get each other's profile.  
Maybe grab a coffee and play together IRL — your call 👀.

# 🧪 Beta Disclaimer & Known Bugs

Yep, it’s beta. Yep, bugs exist. Here are the main ones:

* ⚪ Random gray screen after tapping certain notifications. Not always, and it disappears if you just go back into the app.
* ⚪ Chat messages notify everyone — including you 🤦‍♂️ Will be fixed ASAP.
* ⚪ Error message when joining a lobby You’ll get the same error message whether:
   * you haven’t added the required friend code yet (normal), or
   * you’re already in another lobby (less normal). Just quit your current lobby and you’re good.
* ⚪ No “forgot password” feature (yet) Yeah. I got too hyped adding real features and completely forgot that one. It’s coming this week — for now, just… don’t forget your password 😂.

# 📲 How to Install the Beta

Since it’s beta, the APK is stored on my Google Drive.  
No worries: Google, Samsung, Xiaomi and others automatically scan APKs before installation.

You might need to:

* enable installation from unknown sources
* allow notifications (most devices ask automatically)

If notifications don’t work, check the app’s notification settings on Android.

If something is unclear, badly placed, or confusing: tell me.  
You’re not dumb — people think differently, and I need your perspective to improve the app.

# 🎨 Design Notes

The UI is inspired by old Nintendo / retro vibes.  
Some elements aren’t fully consistent yet because this is an MVP:  
first we test the experience, THEN we polish the UI.

# 🕹️ Platforms & Games

For now: Nintendo platforms only (smaller database to start).  
Within 1 week:

* the 10,000 most played PC games,
* PS4,
* Xbox One will be added.

# 📘 Example Use Cases

# 🏝️ Animal Crossing: New Horizons

Need Miles, Bells, specific items?  
Create a lobby for ACNH, set 2–4 players, describe what you’re looking for.  
People join → you chat → you trade → you make new friends.  
You keep those friends on DingPlay for next time.

# 🕵️ GTA Online – Heists

Finding decent players for Heists is hell: trolls, AFKs, no one joining, etc.  
Now you can create a lobby specifically for the Heist you want to run.  
Problem solved.

# 📅 Release Timeline

If feedback is good and bugs get fixed quickly:

* Google Play V1: January 1st, 2026
* iOS version: February 1st, 2026

(Real-time teammates finder for any game — Nintendo, PC, Xbox, PS4 coming soon)

Hey everyone!  
A lot of you have been waiting for the beta release of DingPlay, so here it is. I’ve been working solo on this project for a month now, using Flutter and Firebase and I’m finally ready to let you try it out and break it (gently 😄).

\-------------------------------------------

# Download Link : [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bxkmy2OUg-GNhYp6Mpqeu3zikgHekVpt/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bxkmy2OUg-GNhYp6Mpqeu3zikgHekVpt/view?usp=sharing)

\-------------------------------------------

# Languages used : Flutter for mobile UI, Firebase CLI & dart for backend requests, Node JS for backend functions

\-------------------------------------------

# Source code : [https://github.com/Sonalpt/DingPlay\_Public\_secure](https://github.com/Sonalpt/DingPlay_Public_secure)

# 🎮 What DingPlay Does (right now)

# ✅ Find the perfect teammate for any game — in REAL TIME

Create or join lobbies instantly.  
Each lobby has its own real-time chat so you can coordinate on the spot.

# ✅ Instant notifications for everything

* A friend invites you to a lobby? → You get notified
* Someone wants to join your lobby? → Notified
* New messages in your lobby chat? → Notified Everything happens instantly.

# ✅ No more sharing friend codes on social networks

Stop posting “Here’s my friend code, add me pls 🙏”.  
DingPlay handles platform IDs automatically and in real-time inside the app.

# ⭐ Upcoming Premium Features

# ⭐ Favorite Games Alerts

Pick your top 3 games.  
→ Whenever someone creates a lobby for one of them, you get an instant invite.

# ⭐ Cross&Play (experimental)

Enable Bluetooth → DingPlay scans nearby users.  
If you share games in common, you instantly get each other's profile.  
Maybe grab a coffee and play together IRL — your call 👀.

# 🧪 Beta Disclaimer & Known Bugs

Yep, it’s beta. Yep, bugs exist. Here are the main ones:

* ⚪ Random gray screen after tapping certain notifications. Not always, and it disappears if you just go back into the app.
* ⚪ Chat messages notify everyone — including you 🤦‍♂️ Will be fixed ASAP.
* ⚪ Error message when joining a lobby You’ll get the same error message whether:
   * you haven’t added the required friend code yet (normal), or
   * you’re already in another lobby (less normal). Just quit your current lobby and you’re good.
* ⚪ No “forgot password” feature (yet) Yeah. I got too hyped adding real features and completely forgot that one. It’s coming this week — for now, just… don’t forget your password 😂.

# 📲 How to Install the Beta

Since it’s beta, the APK is stored on my Google Drive.  
No worries: Google, Samsung, Xiaomi and others automatically scan APKs before installation.

You might need to:

* enable installation from unknown sources
* allow notifications (most devices ask automatically)

If notifications don’t work, check the app’s notification settings on Android.

**Cease To Breathe** is my love letter to that era: a **compact, non-linear** adventure set in a **demonic nowhere-house** that absolutely does not meet building codes. It’s hand-drawn pixel art, dry humor, and puzzles that respect your brain more than your patience. Try a thing. Try a different thing. Then try the clearly ridiculous thing—because it *might* work.

This isn’t a 40-hour epic. It’s a **tight evening-length adventure** you can finish, then **replay for different endings** and “I wonder if…” experiments.

I have given up on dating apps, and a friend told me I should try reddit. And maybe its better?? So here it goes. Wish me luck... 

I'm a hopeless romantic. And at this point as hopless as it gets. And yes, I am exaggerating. But also kind of not. Ive always wanted that relationship that turns into the ultimate end-goal. Kids, house, garden with a Dachshund and a Golden and a cat and spanking each others butts while laughing at our farts. That kind of end-goal. But it hasn't happened and that's okay! But maybe someone out there wants it, too. Just maybe?

I'm 29 and living in Germany. I'm rather short, curvy-slim, brown hair, brown eyes, 10 fingers and 10 toes. 
I'm introverted, although everybody tells me that I dont seem it, since I love working with people and love making people smile. But I really am a true introvert. I love sitting on my couch with my boy cat and watching true crime shows, Netflix and whatever is entertaining. And that includes the occasional reality TV show... I know I know! But as I said, it's entertaining! I love exploring food and coffee spots, since I love food and coffee, and cooking and coffee making. I love cozy video games or the occasional roguelike games *cough cough* Hades *cough cough*. Oh, and I am the best passenger princess you'll ever find. I will open water bottles for you, feed you, have snacks prepared, directions ready, conversations to keep you company and never take you for granted! And yes, I am saying this because I dont have a drivers licence. Yet!! 


What I am looking for: 
You're a 27-38 years old human male. And yes, I do have a preference for Asian Males. Why? I honestly don't know, I just do and I'm okay with it. You have a good sense of humour. I love dad jokes and dark humour and laughing together is. You have empathy and are confident in the person you are.

Ideally you also want to pursue a serious relationship, but I am always open to friendly connecetions. Mental, emotional and sexual chemistry are very important to me, and in my opinion it makes or breaks a relationship. And attraction does plays a role, so let's see if we find each other attractive? But also please, please dont be a catfish and use othe peoples pictures? Come as you are, because so will I.

1pco23s,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1pco23s/5_months_out_and_getting_better/,5 months out and getting better,"I’ve posted on here a few times and commented so as you can see from my history (I have deleted some posts that gave away a lot of identifying info lol) I was truly devastated and lost after my husband had an affair and left me for AP. 

We were together for over 5 years and got married Oct 2024, April 2025 he left for a work trip that kept getting extended. Those were terrible months for me as the man I knew deteriorated so fast. He would barely talk to me, tell me he didn’t know if he wanted to be married (6 months in…) Finally he comes home June 2025 (only for a week) and tells me he wants a divorce. I’m blindsided and later when we sit down to talk I say, so did you cheat on me? (Expecting him to say no so I could feel some relief, but honestly I didn’t really think that he was) and he said “yeah”.

Fast forward, a few weeks of false R, I’m begging for him to come back, he blocks her (on and off for weeks), decides he wants to fix it, and we separate temporarily to give me some space so he lives with his mom for a few weeks. A month after d-day he tells me he wants a divorce but he’s not with her. I never wanted divorce, I wanted R and did everything I could. 

About a week later I meet up with OBS and after sharing some details- surprise, he’s been with her the whole time! Sleeping with the both of us (hysterical bonding on our part I guess). A week later I even get the pleasant surprise of seeing them at our favorite coffee shop together (I made quite a scene lol). He moves in with her. (Still lives with her as far as I know)

Another month goes by and I have the separation agreement so i ask him to come get his copy and talk. I felt like i needed one last final “this is what I want”. He cries, tells me they’re miserable, he hates himself, he can’t sleep, eat etc. kisses me and tries to sleep with me (I’ll admit we went pretty far but I stopped it there because I wanted to still be able to look myself in the eye). Then tells me he feels guilty for “cheating on her”. And tells me he’s gonna go break up with her and try to fix things with me. 

Another surprise, he doesn’t. He later that week tells me he’s gonna try to be better for her and blocks me on all social media lol. 

Now, it’s been five months since dday and over a month divorced. (We were married officially for 1 year and 10 days). We don’t talk much except occasional logistics and I grey rock him, it’s been almost 3 months since the separation agreement talk and I haven’t seen him in person since then. 

I’m nowhere near healed so I’m not trying to say that, but I was writing in my journal and reading my early entries after dday. (TW suicide) I was regularly laying on my bathroom floor begging God to let me die because I was too afraid to do it myself. Self harming and having panic attacks where I would hyperventilate and throw up. I couldn’t imagine my life without him and living with what he’s done to me. I couldn’t be alone and would call him or had to call someone or I was genuinely in fear for my life. I probably drove my friends nuts those first 2/3 months cause I needed someone there 24/7. 

Now, I’ve moved, I got a new job, I have all the pets (which is sometimes annoying but I love them), a great supportive family and friends who have listened to me endlessly. And I am a Christian and have gotten so so close to the Lord in this time which I never expected but it has been my lifeline. Sometimes I feel like life sucks, then I think, wow, I get up in the morning and hum while I get ready, look forward to my morning walk and coffee, spend most of work time busy and not thinking about him. I enjoy my nights now even if I’m alone.. I watch TV, read, cook and bake what I want, workout a ton still. I’ve lost 35 lbs and I think it’ll keep going. I’ve been on a date and it wasn’t great but we just weren’t a match. It made me feel more confident though! 

I have bad moments a decent amount but they are over a lot faster, it doesn’t ruin my day/week like it did before. I cry and ruminate for like 30 mins and it’s over and I’m ok again. Of course I still think about him but it’s not so raw, it’s more like a dull ache now. And of course I’m afraid of the holidays being painful but I’m doing what I can to be present and not think too far in the future, cause that’s scary still. But I feel hopeful, I have good days and even more OK days, only some bad days. 

The biggest thing that helped was NO contact and having zero clue what he’s doing or what’s going on his life. I told family and friends to not say a word to me about what he’s up to, good or bad. It is such a relief now. 

I just wanted to share cause I never thought I’d be here even 2 months ago, and certainly not at the beginning. And everyone here has been so helpful and kind and I’ve spent a lot of time here. I have so much empathy for everyone else going through this cause it’s truly beyond words. I hope eventually I can offer some good advice to people who are where I was. I have a long way to go but the leaps and bounds I’ve made in 5 months give me so much hope for the future. Thanks for listening :) 

Edit: I think I should also say I am SO grateful that my ex didn’t want to reconcile because I never would have left him. And I don’t think I ever would have healed and been happy with him. He gave me an opportunity to be free and find someone eventually who loves and respects me the way I love and respect my partner.",10,1764717940.0,survivinginfidelity,3,0.92,False

1pco1b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EndTipping/comments/1pco1b7/im_a_waitress_in_the_uk_and_dont_like_tipping/,I'm a waitress in the UK and don't like tipping culture,"Love having found this sub, I've been supporting no tipping for maybe 2 years myself. I'm in my early 20s and been working in restaurants 5 years, made my fair share of tips in the past and worked in places earning £800+ tips on top of my hourly pay each month. So I'd be taking home £3,000+ a month in total usually. That was like £36k/year as a 19 year old waitress. Madness.

Of course I gain from tips and won't be mad at earning a little extra, but thats genuinely all it should be, just extra unexpected token money, when I calculate my income, I base it off my hourly pay and don't expect more!

I do not for the life of me understand why customers are expected to fork out money, on top of the items they are buying, to pay for someone's salary. It's madness. Theres genuinely no other industry you see this happening, like do we tip our Bin men? Nurses? Teachers?

I think it's silly we live in a world where waitresses can earn more than a graduates salary earning 1000's+ in tips and not having to even work a 40 hour work week.

How I tip is based on how I feel on the day, but my personal rule of thumb is 10% MAX. If it's crap service then no tip. If theres a card machine option I'll press no tip. If theres no automatic tip on the bill it's usually no tip. And I'll never tip in a cafe. Also, I'm not afraid to ask to remove auto service charge.

Most of the places I've worked in have an auto service charge of 10%. At the place I work now, its up to the waiter to add the 10% before we print the bill, I don't ever use it. I just give the bill as it is, and will not even show the card machine tip option to the customer, I will skip it for them.

The people who want to tip will tip regardless of if it's auto or not, it feels much better for me when someone goes out of their way to tip as a nice gesture rather than out of obligation.

I've had a coworker notice I've not added the auto tip on my bills and she was saying how we won't make much in tips if I keep it up, and went to add the auto tip on for me. It felt so gross honestly.

Just pay staff accordingly, the more we lean into the idea that us as customers need to pay the staffs salary in tips, the more these businesses are going to keep their absurd policies.

Also, the cost of living is crazy now. I like to treat myself to a lunch/coffee out maybe once a week with a friend, which can cost up to what £15-30, in a month thats £120. I'm not eating into my budget to pay a tip every time I want to eat out. Oh, and I hate the argument of: don't eat out of you can't afford to tip. 🤣

Anyways, sorry long rant. Save your money please! And don't be afraid to press no tip or ask to remove service charge!",38,1764717884.0,EndTipping,2,0.85,False

Call me cynical, but any gadget that claims to replace nine appliances while still leaving counter space for coffee sounds like the culinary equivalent of a three-card monte. Yet 50,959 people have anted up $129.99 roughly the price of three decent pans so either the herd is onto something or we're watching the greatest mass hypnosis since fidget spinners.

The math is almost too tidy: 70% faster cooking on a 1000-watt draw versus running your oven for two hours. If you batch-cook even twice a week, the electricity savings alone starts nibbling away at that price tag like a slow-motion rebate. The stainless pot being ""pro-grade"" is marketing fluff, but 18/8 steel at least won't flake Teflon into your chili, which is more than most $40 multicookers can claim.

Here's the kicker this thing's popularity is so bulletproof it barely needs photos. One product image, 4.6 stars, bestseller badge. Amazon's algorithm isn't sentimental; when it crowns a product with that halo, it usually means return rates are microscopic. Translation: people plug it in and stop looking for excuses to send it back.

Would I tell a studio-apartment dweller who survives on takeout to buy it? Absolutely not that's like giving a unicycle to someone who can't ride a bike. But for parents doing weeknight gymnastics between soccer practice and algebra homework, this $130 becomes a weeknight babysitter that also makes dinner. In that context, it's not a gadget it's cheaper than one month of meal-kit subscriptions and arguably less salty.

1pcnzj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteWolfRPG/comments/1pcnzj1/seattle_port_of_darkness_my_crossover_chronicle/,"Seattle: Port of Darkness (my crossover chronicle), part 2 — Chapter I: The Prince and the Prohibition","My updates are infrequent here, mostly because I'm tired. There is not enough coffee in all of Seattle! 

A while back, I started this chronicle. I *love* crossovers in the various worlds of Darkness, and this is no different. Though the game starts with most everyone separate, it's slowly turning into something else. 

This is a PBP game, for what it's worth.

# Prelude

Our biggest event begins with the Kindred. Seattle's Kindred are a storied bunch, with ties going back to the Denny-Murphy Party and earlier, and are inextricably linked to the modern city. 

Every covenant finds a home in Seattle. Invictus and the Carthians have engaged in a long but bloodless tug-of-war for the city's soul. The conflicts have remained purely ideological for decades now, as Lord Hall has historically taken a more progressive approach to maintaining order, but that seems to be changing.

A lot of the city's rulership has only held onto it through some intense conflicts. The eldest members, including the Prince, Thomas Boren (the Seneschal, a *very* severe Sanctified), and much of the Primogen, hail from these old-money estates. Invictus vampires have welcomed progress because mastering the new wave of technological and societal trends have allowed them to remain in power. Better to let the prey—whether human or lesser vampires—think they are in control and go blind to the predators in their midst. To kine, Kindred are those predators. To the Seattle Kindred, the Invictus are those predators.  
  
The overarching goal of the Invictus in Seattle has been maintaining order in the face of such rapid change. For decades, the leadership seemed equal to the task. Lately, as progress has accelerated and change has reared its bloody head, the Invictus find themselves struggling for the first time since the Seattle Fires. Considering that catastrophe, and what it meant for the All Night Society, this leaves many of the elders troubled. Is Seattle a sinking ship? If not, is there still time to right the ship?  
  
Some on the council favor a harsher approach. Let the mortals have their way. All the more reason to keep the Kindred in line. Tighten the leash and end these foolish notions of equality. The ""progress"" kine seek is but an illusion; for the Kindred, that illusion must be dispelled with a swift and lethal stroke. Others advocate for a ""wait and see"" approach, while trying to fend off Carthian advances. In the last several decades, Carthians have found a new home in Seattle, shining beacon of technology and social mores. The Invictus, one and all, don't like it. Maybe an enterprising younger vampire who wanted to see change—and secure their presence as part of it—could jump ship. 

The Invictus helped engineer the legendary Accord in ancient times that helped end widespread conflicts in the city and the surrounding area with those who watch the Kindred.

# The Prince and the Prohibition

Lord Roland Hall is a traditionalist, but once allowed for progressive development within his domain. Recent years have seen Hall grow increasingly reluctant, even paranoid (or so the brave ones whisper when they don't think he can hear them). 

>  
• Decrees: No feeding on children. No vampire may kill birds anywhere within city limits. Yield territories to the Lupines on the outskirts and in the parks.  
• Hails from the settlement of Seattle itself and the Denny-Murphy party. Hall maintains an exclusive art gallery which he typically uses for Elysium, and values the arts (one reason he rose to his position many years ago).  
• Quiet, contemplative, Hall nevertheless speaks with a firm hand, guided by Thomas Boren.

This is his basic profile. Things ... changed. 

Hall called Elysium at his art house, which is where it normally takes place. There he unveiled some of his latest pieces, including a portrait commissioned by Jan Salazar, a Daeva painter with 300 years of experience. 

The painting depicts a distinguished Lord Roland Hall standing against what must be the Cascades at sunset in blacks and reds and deep maroons. Dark clouds crown the mountain peaks as if in smoke; perhaps they are not clouds, but instead stretch out of the background behind Lord Hall's likeness like vast pinions. Too, it seems that the pale moon wreathed in clouds at the corner bathes all the painting in a baleful yellow glow. The glow even catches the painted Hall's eyes, which almost shine as though the frame is moving back and forth beneath the light.

Then Hall unveils his second piece: Salazar's grotesque head on a silver pike. He has been executed for daring to paint such foolishness. 

>""Now,"" Lord Hall snarls, ""please observe our second piece of the night."" He strides swiftly to the sculpture and whips away the cloth. ""A monument to artistic integrity!""  
  
There is Jan Salazar's countenance captured in unlifelike reality—a silver spike driven through his skull from top to bottom, mouth yawning wide, fangs still stained with blood. His hideous visage resembles a melted wax effigy, contorted in the agony of Final Death.  
  
A chorus of sharp gasps echoes about the chamber from the gathered Kindred.  
  
""This, indeed, is suffering for the art!"" Hall's voice rises to a fervor. ""For such foolishness, this is the *only* price that can be paid!"" He jabs his finger toward the crowd and sweeps his hand in a wide arc. ""*You!* All of *you* have brought this about. Too long have we grown complacent. The *things* of Dís threaten the sanctity of this realm, all because we have allowed—because *I* have allowed—you to play at wanton creation. Because you challenge traditions that have kept us in control. But no longer."" Hall snaps his fingers, and two dark-clad ghouls carry forth yet another easel covered in a red cloth. At his gesture, they remove the cloth, revealing a grisly scroll stretched on a cherrywood rack.  
  
""All that was left of dear Salazar's skin, I fear, but it will do. He wished to toy with forces beyond his ken, and now I must keep this city safe, as I have always done."" Hall smiles at this, his tongue flicking at one fang.  
  
Upon the flesh-scroll are etched bloody words, terribly visible despite the gory medium. Hall reads them aloud in an uncharacteristically impassioned voice.  
  


>by DECREE of LORD ROLAND HALL, these TRADITIONS are by BLOOD BOUND and by BLOOD ENFORCED:  
Feeding is now prohibited save by permission only  
Each DOMAIN shall be assigned by LORD HALL  
To those who rule a DOMAIN, all who wish to feed must pledge VASSALAGE by VINCULUM  
To those who wish to feed, a REGNANT must attend  
All disputes to be JUDGED by LORD HALL alone  
To the GUILTY shall be awarded FINAL DEATH

There have been rumors of strange events lately. Disasters that go in cycles, and the cycle has begun again. Some, the oldest, the learned, they whisper of dark things from the city's past. The painting contains the clues that implicate those terrible things, the nameless shadows of fear, and Hall has moved to strike swiftly. 

They're gone, you see. Or maybe they never were. But we are not going to invite them back into modern nights with such foolishness. So thinks Lord Hall, in a rather marked departure from his more conservative approach to peace. 

Of all the Kindred leadership, only Thomas Boren seems unperturbed by these events. Roland's advisor always stands at the center of decisions. The Prince relies on him more and more. Soft-spoken, he yet carries himself with a heavy presence. Boren brooks no disrespect and demands decorum under pain of the lash. Boren offers sermons at a particular church on the west side after dark, on Friday nights, where he claims to have seen the world's ending in a tide of blood and change. Those who witness these leave forever changed, noting a fire in the Ventrue's beady eyes unlike anything he normally displays. 

Thus is an utterly insane Prohibition declared on the back of accusations of misconduct the likes of which might have awakened an ancient enemy. This throws the domain into uproar, of course.

What's going on? No one is yet sure. The PC coterie has gathered at the Speakeasy in its current form (as the Merchant's Saloon) to determine how best to resist or ride the wave. 

# Blood Trails

Meanwhile, a day or so ago, hikers in one of the national park areas were attacked by a strange creature. It looks something like Slenderman's mutant cousin, three arms, blank eyes, claws, mottled skin, stinks of brine. One of the hikers managed to escape, but the other died. 

So did the creature. Werewolves killed it. Nathan Farrow is one of them, the sole werewolf PC at the moment. An ex-soldier, now a Blood Talon Rahu (though he scarcely understands that what means), he killed his squad in a Death Rage during his First Change. He's new to the world, barely understanding any of it yet, and has returned home to troubled family life and a world he no longer fits into. 

Life for the area's werewolves has been tough lately, and the pack he's part of is a pack of two, having lost the other members not long ago. The other is an NPC, Amari, an Ithaeur (and reincarnation of a long-running character of mine that started way back in Apocalypse), who is trying to teach him the ropes and is in way over her head doing it. 

This pack found the hiker and the creature that killed him, and they killed it in turn, then tried to disguise the killing because the authorities got there before they could get rid of the body. They were slowed down by the poison in its claws, and ultimately, police took the bodies. 

This is a problem. 

The pack tracked the creature to a morgue in Bellevue. Now, Seattle's morgues (especially this version of it, a foggier, darker, and more occult-steeped Seattle) have a bit of a storied history with weird and terrifying events. This one's no different. In fact, Amari, being rather knowledgeable about the occult, has heard that one of the city's morgues is supposed to be home to a witch who meat-puppets the bodies for whatever perverse motivations she has. 

(Wanna guess which morgue it is?) 

So they track the body to the morgue and go in the middle of the night. Amari has to use a Spirit Whispers to help them get into the morgue. Nathan, of course, reacts strongly to this, because he doesn't understand all this spirit shit, or his role as a half-fleshed. 

# The Ick and the Dead

Unfortunately, the place isn't empty. Sophia, the mage, a Moros of the Mysterium, is in fact examining the bodies. She discovers a few things. The hiker didn't die of the claw wounds, for example. They were rough but not nearly lethal. No, after a thorough examination, she discovers he died from a biotoxin. It wasn't just poisoning, either; it was *envenomation*. The biotoxin appears to be naturally occurring but does not match the profile of any local wildlife. 

Sophia then gets to examine the other body, the corpse of our gangly-limbed abomination. Her assistant is excited, because he thinks this will make them famous. Sophia already knows the Guardians are gonna have to come MiB this shit. 

The hiker's gunshots ostensibly killed the creature before he succumbed to his own wounds. Scavengers got at its corpse afterward. So the evidence suggests. With Death and her own forensic skills, Sophia quickly determines the gunshots came post-mortem. The ""scavenging""? Pre-mortem. Then she views the last couple minutes of its life to confirm what she suspected: werewolves killed this thing. Sophia knows there are packs that live in and around Seattle, but has not met any personally. 

# Bump in the Night

Well, anyway, so our werewolves break into the morgue, determined to hide the body. They are surprised to find Sophia, who surmises what they are after and at least expects a little decorum. She agrees with the concept, if not their rather brute force approach (Nathan having gone full headstrong here to break in and take it, no matter what, because the job needs done). 

Their conversation looks a little tense, and Sophia is wondering if she won't need to escape to Twilight (or send the bigger and angrier of the two werewolves to Twilight). Nathan demands the body. Chamber six, she tells him. 

The lights flicker. Sophia, who has Death Sight active, sees shadows fleeing the mortuary chamber in ways that shadows can't move. She catches a glimpse of ... wings? Yellow eyes. 

They all hear the *shunk* of bone-on-metal before anyone can get to the chamber. Out stumbles our abomination, its empty eye sockets glowing with a horrid yellow light, seemingly reanimated many hours after its death.

The power goes out. Everything goes dark. 

# Annnnd scene!

So that's where we are right now. Combat's about to begin in the morgue. The PC vampire coterie are confronting the city's Sheriff, a Gangrel who was seemingly destroyed, but is back under mysterious circumstances. 

Danger lurks at every turn! Something cataclysmic seems to loom on the horizon. What is going on? Who can be trusted? 

... does Sophia really meat-puppet the bodies she examines?

Backstory - I'm 34 F. Became HPV positive around 2019 and had my first colposcopy October of 2021. Results were I guess not worrisome enough to do more, so I continued annual paps and have consistently come up positive for ""other high risk HPV"" (not 16 or 18) - for years now I have not been able to clear it. I had a pap in June with the same results and they asked me to do another colposcopy in October which showed CIN 2 and CIN 3, triggering the need for a LEEP which I had on November 18.

The unexpected part of the recovery has been how...OK it's all been. I know I'm only 2 weeks in, so more could happen, but here's the timeline of recovery so far:

Days 1-2: mild cramping and discomfort with no discharge yet due to Monsel's solution. Doctor performed the LEEP without removing my Nuvaring and inserted a ""medicated"" tampon (found out via visit notes that it was dipped in Monsel's, I think). I was instructed to remove it after about 4 hours and it unfortunately pulled out my Nuvaring with it, which was a PAIN to get back in and it would not stay in for about 3 days.

  
Days 2-4: The expected coffee ground discharge plus some yellow coloring from the Monsel's. Nuvaring finally stayed in place about 3 days in, but caused soreness around the vaginal opening from having to keep pushing it back (worrisome, I know, because they say nothing in the vagina for weeks, but I was very careful to clean my hands thoroughly before doing this?? idk what else I could've done).

  
Days 5-8: Large clumps of the Monsel's coming out. Mostly brown discharge.

  
And here's what's weirding me out - since then I've had pretty much only a somewhat thick yellow discharge, but not the mustard yellow of the Monsel's, like a light lemonade yellow. No horrible smell and no pain or itching. I just expected...worse? I haven't had any bleeding yet and I feel that could happen if any burn skin comes off my cervix eventually, but did anyone else have a relatively light recovery in terms of discharge??? I'm weirded out by how much is NOT coming out. It feels entirely equal to my colpo recovery, but I thought this was supposed to be worse / longer. Idk why I'm asking for reassurance that I'm OK seeing as everything is fine, but just wondering if anyone else had a similar recovery experience. ",2,1764717556.0,PreCervicalCancer,4,0.75,False

I'm just confused and would like some insight from people with experience with this sort of thing. I [M24] came back to Uni after a taking a year off for medical reasons. Anyways, that's all fixed and now I'm living life the fullest, making my dreams a reality, yadda yadda, suffice to say I'm pretty fulfilled!

So I wanted to finish getting my degree for my career goals! I imagined I'd come to class, do what was needed and keep doing my social, creative, sports, extracurricular, and fun endeavors/projects/activities outside of school like I always do and did since before I was hospitalized for a year.

Anyways, come to my surprise when this girl [18] approached on one of the first days of class and just sat down next to me outside of our class, shook my hand and introduced herself to me and just started asking me a bunch of questions which kick started a fun conversation! I was really happy and appreciative of this interaction, because it was the first human interaction I had with someone outside of a patient setting for over a year! 

With all the questions she asked, it eventually came up why I took a leave, why I came back, my life outside of school, and of course the age gap. I made it clear that if she was uncomfortable forming a friendship with a guy who's 6 years older than her and in a very different part of their life than where they are, then no worries at all we can go our own ways and that I was very appreciative for her reaching out to me.

Surprisingly she didn't have an issue, eventually she gave me her number, invited me out for coffee, would constantly caress my shoulder in class when she'd say good morning, wanted me to walk her to her next class, asking me questions (id ask her questions but she was always in too much of a rush to answer them and wasnt a very good texter) and for the record I just really wanted a friendship and didn't know what her aim was.

Anyways, one day she randomly stops doing all that stuff, (after maybe a few walks together), and during one of our walks she's being a little rude, cold, and mildly disrespectful. At the end of our walk I asked if she was down for that coffee she asked me out for, but she said she couldn't cause she was studying with friends, I asked if next Friday worked (which I learned is something you shouldn't do), and she said she's booked and two ask her again in a few weeks.

After feeling pretty confused and emotionally drained from that interaction, I figured that if she wanted to hang out with me then she'd let it be known so I didn't pursue her, and didn't walk with her after class anymore (though I always left myself open if she wanted to catch up or talk or anything, I just stopped initiating).

Eventually I had to take a week leave to travel for a world competition involving my sport and to speak at a huge conference regarding my recovery from my illness for insurance (long story, but I told my teachers about it and they suggested I saty in contact with a classmate to keep me posted on anything I'd miss in class).


That girl was more than down to help me out and kept up to date on the coursework. Also asked me a question of where I was in the area I traveled to, I answered but then never got a response from her.

I come back, and it was the same non-interaction from her as usual, and I was really just confused since I was stoked about having my first friendship at my Uni. 

The week I come back it's her birthday week, and well I had no choice but to tell her happy bday after class was over. I really wanted to stay cordial and cool with this person still (since were probably going to be in similar classes due to our major) so made her some merch from my nonprofit recovery organization, and included a bday letter thanking her for reaching out to me that first day of class, the positivity she brought to class, and that we can still be cool if we have another class together.

Let her know about the gift beforehand and she was enthusiastic. We walked after class together again and I asked how she's been before giving her the gift and she told me that her friend [F19] is dating a [M32] and that she was going on a double date but the original girl couldn't make it, so they invited my classmate [F18] to fill in for the girl who flaked on the guy [M28] (friend of the 32 y/o) as his date. Yeah wild, stuff.

I asked if she had a fun time, and she said it was nice because I got free food, but, ""I didn't really talk to the guy. And honestly I'm not looking to date right now."" I said same neither am I, so I gave her the gift and she later replies that she loved the gift, emojis and all, and was excited to seeing me the following school week. Wished her happy bday, no response but I didn't care.

Anyways were back in class now, and it's our last week in this course. I couldn't find her afterwards since I wanted to talk to her directly again. I'll only see her two more times before our finals then we're done.

I guess I should've made this post after this quarter was done, but I'm just really confused since she seemed really interested in being my friend, and left a real positive impact on me through that initial interaction, and when I expressed interest in taking her up on her offer, she declined and stopped being warm towards me and has remained fairly distant ever since.

Through all the confusion I'm not really interested in being this person's friend anymore since my life is so busy and fulfilling as it is, but gosh darn it am I confused from this whole thing. Sorry for the long post, even if no one reads or replies just writing it out has helped sort my emotional stress from it. If anything happens or if anybody is curious, I'll more than likely comment or edit an update into this post.


So tldr:
Ive returned to university after a year away for medical reasons and was excited to rebuild my social life. An 18 y/oclassmate immediately showed strong interest in befriending me. Asking questions, giving me her number, inviting me out, and being physically affectionate! Then suddenly became distant and inconsistent. After I tried to follow through on her invite, she pulled back, acted cold, and stopped engaging, though she still helped me with class updates while I was traveling. Even after I gave her a thoughtful birthday gift, her behavior remained warm one moment and distant the next. Now, with the class ending, I'm confused by her mixed signals and lack of interest in pursuing the friendship, but the abrupt shift still confuses me.",1,1764717449.0,dating_advice,11,0.67,False
1pcnv3k,https://i.redd.it/trqf767wiv4g1.jpeg,Weird caffeine episode — body shaking in waves + strange visuals when eyes closed. Talked to ChatGPT and learned it wasn’t just palpitations.,"Earlier today, I mixed one Nescafe Original twin pack + one Nescafe stick in less than 500 mL of water, and drank the entire thing in under 5 minutes (image added for caffeine content scale). I’ve actually done this around three times in the past four months, and I’ve also drunk twin packs before with no issues. The worst I’ve ever gotten from caffeine was palpitations — never anything more serious — so I didn’t think anything bad would happen.

But about 8–10 hours later, something extremely strange happened.

Parts of my body started shaking in waves. Like literally, the sensation moved around my body:

starting from my feet

then my legs

then my stomach

then my arms

then my face


For a moment, I genuinely thought there was an earthquake.

Then when I closed my eyes, I began seeing strange visuals — things felt like they were moving, shaking, or getting bigger even though my eyes were shut. The whole episode lasted around 2–3 minutes.

I was initially scared because it was so unfamiliar… but after it stopped and everything went back to normal, I got really curious and wanted to understand what the hell just happened.

So I talked to ChatGPT, and it basically told me I had a mild caffeine intoxication + a caffeine-triggered adrenaline/panic-type reaction, which explains the full-body shaking and weird closed-eye visuals. I didn’t even know caffeine could do THAT — I honestly thought the only side effects were palpitations and jitters. I didn’t know there were deeper neurological reactions possible, so I was oddly excited to learn that there’s an actual name for what happened.

I’m totally fine now, but I want to hear from real people or anyone who has experienced something similar.

What exactly happened to me? Has anyone else had this kind of reaction from coffee?",0,1764717447.0,caffeine,3,0.25,False

Overweight and poor diet in the past,  major regrets. Weekdays 2 large coffees black by 11am and eating one evening meal per day with afterwards evening snacking. Weekends eating careless.

History 1
About 10 months ago had a rough episode that felt like a heart attack or panic attack with pain and digestive issues that cleared up in 24 hour of so with rest. I was traveling at the time did not seek medical help. 

History 2

Have had upper back pain on and off for years, right between shoulder blades or right shoulder blade. Coughing phlegm every morning for past 3 month. Thought this was a cold but now understand it was likely GERD.


Fast forward to present. Had laryngitis for 2 days. This led to more back pain and left shoulder pain. Went to ER, ecg cardiac blood, chest x-ray and blood panel  for suspected heart attack. All normal. Sent home with steroid to clear lungs thinking it was post covid or something.

Within 1 week back to the ER with pain under breast bone and back pain and heart palpitations. CT with contrast was done and heart looked good. This time sent home with 7 days Naproxen (14 pills). I tool maybe 7 pills over 4 days following and it seemed to help the back pain.

1 more week later, had nausea eating an egg for breakfast. And stool changes to light brown mushy blobs then finally one pale brown. Called family Dr.

Got into the family Dr within 5 days
Explained the stool changes. My stools have not been great for as long as I can remember  but never this pale and greasy. Discomfort mostly at bade of esophagus and feel better sipping water or coconut milk to ease burning.

Sent for abdominal ultrasound, CDC, celiac screen, urine and stool and H pylori breath test. Doctor's office is now closed for 1 week of holiday. Called the secretary and advised file updated with ""nothing serious"" from ultrasound  labs but booked follow-up with their nurse in 9 days.


Meanwhile I started a gluten free diet but have almost no appetite. Back pain left for nearly 1 day but returned with intestinal bloating and warm sensation. Stool turned more greasy tary and nausea is like a 3 or 4. Not vomiting but absolutely no appetite. Lots of gas. Any food I've eaten was intentional to slow the weight loss. Cantaloupe and another egg.

I feel like my body is telling me this is becoming an acute AND chronic thing. I don't even have official diagnosis. Timing sucks with holidays coming.

All blood was good 4 days ago except low
Creatinine. Liver enzymes good. Celiac antigen negative. Urine normal. Urine culture pending, stool pending. 2 stools in 4.5 days but missed first attempt at collection. For the stool test the Dr ordered, Im not sure if Elastase included for stool test). Remember  Doctor suggesting to check parasite and microbial...


Today finally got the stool sample collected after a nap woke up slightly sweaty and with headach.

Ugh!
I feel so dumb not connecting the dots here with bad stools and back pain between shoulder blades for years. Soft mushy nuggets and light brown/ yellow floaters for years. Probably more digestive episodes I cannot recall.

Questions:

For these types of issues is it okay to wait out with nausea at 2-4 for a 9 days given some tests outstanding still? Now my intestines feel like discomfort when I sit. Thinking bacj i had to a lesser extent in the past. Lying down or standing is how I feel slightly okay now.

When should I go to the ER?
Anything I should advocate for in testing?
Does 9 days make a big difference if I remain somewhere close to stable? Considering if an ER trip will help anything.

Any advise what to eat or drink. I realize low fat is better now.

Anyone have similar history that lines up with chronic pancreatitis?

Is gluten free a good idea to stick with? Just in case it was a false negative? (Sibling is Gluten intolerant and gets rashes)

Sincerely, 
Anxious, depressed and nauseated

If you still have any questions after reading this in it’s entirety please drop a comment below.

I would also like to say that my memory was greatly affected during PAWS and I was not actively taking notes over the years. If there are discrepancies or inaccuracies in my personal timelines that is a result of faulty memory. It is not a willful intention to deceive. I only say this because I have been called out on this in the past and wish to address it up front. In that same vein, I would also like to say that I have jumped the gun before and claimed to be “fully healed” only to realize that it was a brief 2 week break in symptoms rather than a complete elimination of them. To avoid this I have waited 6 weeks after all symptoms have subsided just to ensure I was truly cured from them rather than it being a “window”.

**Full PMO Addiction Recovery Timeline: From the development of PIED to the End of PAWS**

I first developed severe Porn Induced Erectile Disfunction (PIED) in the fall of 2020 (somewhere in the September/November months). I realized I had developed a problem when I tried to be intimate with a real life partner and could not achieve an erection. It took until about March of 2021 for me to discover NoFap as a solution to this problem. After about a year I was finally about to break the 90 NoFap day milestone in September of 2022. I started developing PAWS Symptoms or “severe flatline” in about March or April of 2023. By this time I was no longer practicing NoFap and switched to Semen Retention. From September 2022 onwards I was able to achieve a steak over 1 year which ended in October 2023. After that I had another streak of about 319 days which ended in January 2025. I nearly fully recovered from PAWS in December of 2025.

2020

·         September/November - Developed severe PIED. Unable to achieve erection with real life partner.

2021

·         March – Discovered NoFap and Gary Wilson book “Your Brain on Porn”

2022

·         June - Reached 90 days of NoFap

·         September – Broke streak with a real life partner

2023

·         March/April – Development of Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome / Severe Flatlines

·         October – Ended 1 year + streak

2024

·         March/April - 1 year of PMO PAWS – My life was a living hell

2025

·         March/April – 2^(nd) year of PMO PAWS – Substantial improvement in all areas

·        May – November - PAWS symptoms significantly reduced, still lingering

December Nearly fully healed from PMO PAWS – All symptoms completely gone. I will likely be free of all symptoms within the next 3 months.



I felt it was important to show this full timeline in order to emphasize a point which does not get talked about enough in these communities: Healing from PMO addiction is a potentially **multi-year process.** The 90 day recovery timeline will set you up for failure and disappointment. There are many factors which will impact your personal recovery timeline. Your journey could be longer or shorter depending on these factors.

 

**Basic Background Relevant to Recovery**

Discovered PMO sometime during teenage years. Likely 11- 13 years old. Developed a consistent and enduring porn habit with an average of 1-3 sessions daily which lasted until age 26. Signs of desensitization and escalation over the years (meaning needing more extreme material to get a diminishing level of high). I was a “prone PMOer” which I have read makes recovery worse. Grew up in a dysfunctional and abusive family environment. Exposed to physical and emotional abuse regularly (will become relevant later).

Started consciously breaking the addiction at age 26, now age 30.

Lifestyle Factors:

·         Work out minimum of 3 days per week on average (Compound & Barbell workouts)

·         Go for 10 min walks usual once per day

·         Largely eat “clean” – I would estimate that in a normal week my consumption of processed and ultra processed foods is in the range of 10% - 20%. Most of my meals are cooked and prepared at home. Moderate seasoned. No condiments

·         Typically drink filtered water, milk or tea. Occasionally coffee.

·         Good exposure to sunlight, live in the South West region of the US.

·         Slightly overweight

·         No history of major illnesses or chronic diseases. Had Asthma during childhood.

·         Knowledge work job, largely sedentary during these hours.

·         Decent community ties and friends whom I see on a weekly basis

·         High sensory processing, also known as [Sensory Processing Sensitivity (SPS)](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&cs=1&sca_esv=b42e03ff43b61ad3&sxsrf=AE3TifOoo539HwFJEqRJyGTcnoZtaaIQpg%3A1748981196608&q=Sensory+Processing+Sensitivity+%28SPS%29&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjbjaLXhtaNAxWTL9AFHezuBekQxccNegQIAhAB&mstk=AUtExfDFwAxayJnqBN10DmfWE_uI7bplsd7XClT_E4CE22T0VisQSzcapxzhBkWcfKXKZ7lolARINJTPJc8HSK6zojWQbuY-tMVBQfXmQAnkxZdBl42GNQV0E-RhIhtnc9OpYWZfEfZIrc3uMBM9QS5Axf_XamBXcbnJwAD4u127SeM8Su8&csui=3) or being a [Highly Sensitive Person (HSP)](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&cs=1&sca_esv=b42e03ff43b61ad3&sxsrf=AE3TifOoo539HwFJEqRJyGTcnoZtaaIQpg%3A1748981196608&q=Highly+Sensitive+Person+%28HSP%29&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjbjaLXhtaNAxWTL9AFHezuBekQxccNegQIAhAC&mstk=AUtExfDFwAxayJnqBN10DmfWE_uI7bplsd7XClT_E4CE22T0VisQSzcapxzhBkWcfKXKZ7lolARINJTPJc8HSK6zojWQbuY-tMVBQfXmQAnkxZdBl42GNQV0E-RhIhtnc9OpYWZfEfZIrc3uMBM9QS5Axf_XamBXcbnJwAD4u127SeM8Su8&csui=3)

 

**Parameters of my Recovery (Semen Retention?, NoFap?)**

Here I will explicitly state what I mean by the term “Semen Retention” and the parameters that I applied to myself within the practice. Complete abstinence of engaging in all sexual acts and viewing of sexual material. This includes both acts with a real life partner or a digital substitute. Wet dreams do not impact the practice since that is largely an unconscious process. I also try to keep my thoughts away from sexual thoughts and acts as a form of “mental celibacy”.

Now that I have clearly defined how I personally practice retention I would like to include an important caveat. I was in a relationship with a woman for about 13 months of this journey. During that time I defined Semen Retention as “No masturbation or viewing digital substitutes”. I was upfront with her about my porn addiction and Semen Retention journey from the beginning. We did not engage in sex that entire time (which ultimately led to the relationship failing) however we often close to each other physically and engaged in non-sexual touch. I include this disclaimer because I speak of it in my previous reddit posts which I include below. Some of you will not believe me, but it is the truth.

**Symptoms experienced during PAWS**

Here are the symptoms I experienced through the 33 months of PAWS:

·         Chronic Fatigue

·         Extreme Mood Swings

·         Anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure or pain)

·         Insomnia

·         Apathy

·         Random aches and pains

·         Panic attacks

·         Anxiety

·         Feelings of violent rage

·         Feelings of Hypersexuality

·         Depression

·         Extreme Despair

·         Loneliness

·         Gastrointestinal issues

·         Extreme Brain Fog

·         Memory Loss

·         Constant “Hungover” feeling

·         Childhood Trauma resurfacing

I also experienced an extreme and seemingly unique case of “Restless Leg Syndrome” where I would experience intense pulling and twitching in my calves at night. Over the duration of paws this phenomena advanced down my legs to my feet as the months progressed. My hypothesis is that this sensation is connected to my nervous system physically repairing itself.  This symptom also went away with time and no other intervention was needed.

I asked Grok AI and got an answer that was helpful:

>RLS and PAWS from Porn Addiction: The Connection

>Porn addiction, like other behavioral addictions (e.g., gambling, gaming), can lead to withdrawal-like symptoms when stopping, often tied to dopamine dysregulation in the brain. PAWS, in this context, refers to lingering psychological and sometimes physical symptoms—think anxiety, depression, irritability, or sleep issues—that persist weeks to months after quitting. RLS, with its hallmark urge to move the legs and uncomfortable sensations (tingling, aching, crawling), is strongly linked to dopamine imbalances, which makes it plausible that PAWS from porn addiction could trigger or worsen it.

>Here’s the mechanism in simple terms:

>Porn and Dopamine: Frequent porn use spikes dopamine, the brain’s reward chemical. Over time, the brain downregulates dopamine receptors to cope, creating a tolerance effect. When you quit, dopamine levels crash, leaving the brain in a low-dopamine state, which can persist during PAWS.

>RLS and Dopamine: RLS is tied to dysfunction in dopamine pathways, particularly in the basal ganglia, which control movement. Low dopamine or receptor sensitivity (common in PAWS) can manifest as RLS symptoms, especially at night when dopamine naturally dips.

>PAWS Overlap: PAWS from porn addiction often includes restlessness, anxiety, and sleep disruption—symptoms that align with or could amplify RLS-like sensations. If your feet or legs feel restless or achy, especially when resting, it might reflect this dopamine-driven overlap.

**Challenges during Recovery**

The biggest challenge in the beginning was ignorance. I crossed the 90 day threshold and assumed I was home free. It took almost a year of experiencing all the symptoms above before I started looking for more answers. I posted to the SR subreddit and would get unhelpful answers such as “it’s stuck energy bro”. I’m not even sure how but eventually I found this reddit and the PMO PAWS Discord and finally got the answers I needed.

Once I discovered my symptoms were connected to PAWS the next biggest challenge was the daunting truth: **A typical 2 year recovery timeline.** Honestly learning this almost broke me. It was extremely demoralizing after all I had already been through. My choices were: 1) Be a slave to PMO for the rest of my life 2) Suffer through 2 years of PAWS and be fee. The second choice still sucked but ultimately was the better deal. I had to learn to just survive day by day and have faith I would survive.

To say this experience sucked is an understatement. PAWS is a grueling, demoralizing and painful experienced that feels unending in it’s length and cruelty. I damaged my personal relationships with my constant mood swings and threats of violence. My mind was frayed to it’s limits with the resurfacing of all the fucked up abuses I faced in childhood constantly popping into my head at random moments. I had undiagnosed PTSD for a couple months triggered by PAWS and I just felt constantly on edge and anxious as hell. This is definitely the hardest thing I ever had to face in life so far.

Another weird thing that happens whilst in PAWS is people treat you like shit. I’ve had more confrontations or disrespectful actions directed towards me than I can count. You feel at your absolute lowest and it feels like the whole world is conspiring to constantly keep kicking you down. The world seems crueler during this time.

For me personally the hardest thing to deal with was feeling useless during PAWS. My brain didn’t work, my dick didn’t work and my body was broken. I felt sub-human. It took me a long time to regain my confidence.

**Solutions during Recovery**

To successfully make it through PAWS you will need two things: Faith and Acceptance. You will need to develop an unshakable faith that your body will return to normal after two years of suffering. You will also need to learn to accept that as of this writing there is **no way to shortcut the two- three year recovery timeline.**

I say this because I was one of those people who thought they would be the exception to the rule… I tried Trauma Release Exercises (TRE) for a couple of months hoping to speed up recovery. It didn't speed up recovery, but it did alleviate my PTSD symptoms which was greatly helpful. I stopped TRE after about 8 months.

In the long term this thinking only causes more suffering. Just accept it will take a long time for your brain to recover and adjust your life accordantly.

Focus on the basics if you don’t have that down already:

·         Clean diet

·         Drink water

·         Exercise

·         ***REST***

As an ambitious person the hardest part to accept during PAWS was the fact that I couldn’t live my life the same. I no longer had my “SR Superpowers”. For most of 2024 the best I could do was perform mediocrely at work and then come home and sleep on the couch until the next day. Over time as you start to feel better and better you can push yourself more. REST. Ultimately that will be the thing that helps you recover. And don’t be too hard on yourself.

I came out of a long term relationship a few years ago and it’s been difficult finding someone right for me, let alone being the right person for someone else. 
Who am I? I’m pretty goofy, an old soul, and a business man during the day. I’d really like to start seeing someone who also has serious intentions for a real relationship. 

I know some nice cafés, but let me know if you have any in mind that you’d like to meet at first.

I’m 5’10, half white with a beard, very active but have a dad bod, and charismatic. I love cats a lot lol. I’m a really simple man, so I’m happy to do anything so long as we can enjoy it together. 

You: I’m open to anyone 19-40, and mature.

Message me with your age, whereabouts you live, and we can think of a place to first meet in public.

The Canadiens and Senators are set to clash in a game so physical it could double as a WWE tryout, and so statistically dense it could make a spreadsheet weep. Let’s break this down with the precision of a linesman and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffees.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The betting market is as split as a tie in a playoff race. Montreal sits at **+200** (implied probability: \~33.3%) on DraftKings, while Ottawa is the slight favorite at **-220** (\~68.7%). The spread? Montreal is a +1.5 underdog, and the total is set at **6.5 goals**, with “Under” priced at \~54% implied odds.

Here’s what the numbers scream:

* **Offense**: Montreal leads in goals per game (3.42 vs. 3.04) and shooting percentage (13.8% vs. 11.7%). Ottawa’s defense, though, is stingier, allowing just 2.8 goals per game.
* **Special Teams**: Montreal’s power play (23.5%) is a beast compared to Ottawa’s (21.8%), but their penalty kill (76.5%) is also elite. Ottawa’s faceoff dominance (57.8% vs. 50.1%) could control the tempo.
* **Goaltending**: Linus Ullmark (3.10 GAA, .874 SV%) for Ottawa vs. Samuel Montembeault (3.48 GAA, .864 SV%) for Montreal. Ullmark’s stats look better, but Montembeault’s home-ice advantage might even the odds.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Bobbleheads, and Family Feuds

Montreal’s Nick Suzuki is the star to watch, a future Olympic hero who’s as smooth as a freshly waxed Zamboni. The Canadiens are also armed with the **Xhekaj brothers (Florian and Arber)**, who’ve vowed to “manage intensity” but might instead reenact a medieval duel. Jayden Struble’s return adds a spark, though his pregame focus on “protecting teammates” over “playing his game” sounds like a guy who’s about to trip over his own skates.

Ottawa’s Brady Tkachuk is back, and let’s be honest, Tkachuk in a rivalry game is like a lit fuse near a gas station. The Senators are missing Thomas Chabot (upper-body injury), which is like asking a chef to cook without

All I want to do is to get a stable job that's full-time so I can get out of my hometown. but that is such a huge pain. This is so I can move out of my parents and be with my partner. We personally don't care about having roommates. The problem is that so many that we want to go doesn't allow more than one bedroom. Renting is also very expensive and I'm so sick of the 3x the rent on top of it. Like, WHO MAKES THAT MUCH DURING THIS TIME? It wasn't like that back then for renting. The job market is EXTREMELY dehumanizing right now. I graduated with a BA in Digital Arts and Sciences in Spring of 2024. As we all know, hundreds of applications. Crickets or sometimes rejections. I got rejected from coffee jobs, minimum wage jobs. I applied to some places multiple times. Nothing. Entry-level places require experience. My partner goes through a lot. I have 2 jobs, but they both suck at giving me hours, and they don't listen to giving me more, which leads to me not making that much. It sucks. My partner is physically disabl,ed and they can't work as much, but I know for a fact that they want to work. Disability for them is a huge pain, too. 

There's also how I see some of my friends thriving heavily with high-paying jobs, one who's a paramedic firefighter, living in one bedroom with their significant other. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy for them. I want them to thrive. The only thing is that it makes me question what I'm doing wrong. Why is this happening? Is it really my fault? I know I shouldn't say it's my fault, but it really feels like it. It's not fair. I feel so behind in life. I know others have similar situations as me. I don't care if I have to work at fast food if it means full-time. Not even fast food wants me. It's honestly why I kept my 2 jobs for a year, so I wouldn't be unemployed. When will this ever end? All I want to do is live my life with my partner and be free from my toxic family. At this point, there are no 'recession indicators' because it already feels like it.

It was a long time before I finally fell asleep that night. The lights of passing cars painted lines across the ceiling through the shoddy curtains. Somewhere in the distance, a freight train called out. After about the eight-billionth time rolling over in a vain attempt to find a comfortable position, the HVAC unit rattled and kicked on.

I’d keyed Marcus’s number and hit dial before I was awake enough to think about what I would even say. It didn’t ring more than twice before the line crackled.

“J-man! Kinda late for a booty call, dude. What’s up?”

“No sleep for me tonight,” I muttered. “Anyway, you told me to call, remember?”

“Sure I did. Just thought you’d do it yesterday. Listen—I’m a bit tied up at the moment. If you want to talk, come to the address I’m sending you. And bring coffee while you’re at it.”

“Yeah, yeah. Alright.”

My phone said he was only fifteen minutes away at some transmission shop or something.

“See you in a bit.”

I glanced around the stuffy motel room to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything. I didn’t bring much in—just didn’t have it in me to unpack. I scooped up my keys, threw on my jacket, and stepped into the cold.

It took a full five minutes for my car to warm up. I stuffed my hands in my pockets and drummed my feet to fight the early morning chill seeping through everything. One gas station run and a white Monster later, I was beginning to feel human again. I shoved a honey bun into my glovebox behind the air filter and cranked the heat to toast it.

I pulled into the mechanics shop around 3AM. Aside from the graveyard of parts cars scattered around the lot, I recognized Marcus’s Tacoma and a Prius with out-of-state plates. The sign in the window was off. So were the lights. But behind the roll-up garage doors, something faint crackled.

I tried the side door and knocked.

There was a pause—the sound of a chair moving, then several clicks—before the door swung open. Judy stood framed in the doorway, sporting elbow-length green gloves over the same suit she’d worn the previous morning. Her air of professionalism was no less precise, despite the setting.

“Are we delivering a calf or something?” I blurted.

Shockingly, she chortled at that. She recovered quickly and waved me inside.

“Hurry up. I don’t own this place.”

“Sorry—Marcus didn’t mention you’d be here, or I would’ve brought more coffee.”

She relocked the door and propped a metal chair under the handle.

“No worries. I brought my own. Mark’s over in the pit. Go grab a seat, sounded like you had a busy first day’l

Ignoring the irony behind that last comment for the time being, I rolled a stool over to the edge of the lift pit, where Marcus was hauling thick-gauge extension cables. He glanced up, grinned when he saw the tall Styrofoam cup, and took it with both hands.

“Aaah, you’re a lifesaver. We’re on a bit of a tight schedule tonight, so you’ll have to bear with us working while we talk.”

The cords ran across the floor toward a microwave lying on its back and some instruments I didn’t recognize. With more questions than sleep in me, I decided to stick with what I could handle.

“What’s the microwave for?” I asked.

“The sample we took earlier isn’t stable,” he said. “It starts degrading within hours of being separated from the colony. We’re too far from any of our permanent labs, so in certain cases…” He gestured at the spaghetti mess. “…we improvise.”

Judy approached, apparently having predicted my next question.

“Nyctophyllosis,” she said. “A metastable crystalline silicon—”

She held the ceramic vessel from earlier in her gloved hands, stepping carefully toward the pit.

“Think of it like a fluid made of microscopic solar panels. Except we don’t know what it’s made of or how it works. The closest we’ve gotten is mass spectrometry, but that destroys the sample almost instantly. What we can infer is that it feeds on most forms of electromagnetic radiation, and it’s sensitive to high-energy wavelengths like ionizing radiation and UV.”

I let her talk. I wasn’t awake enough in high school science to have ever understood this stuff, and she didn’t seem bothered by that. If anything, the lecture felt like a side effect of her nerves.

“We can contain a sample with most of its mass intact by encasing it inside a glass sphere using a short, yet powerful burst of microwave radiation. Hence the… McGyver setup.”

They secured the container inside the microwave. Marcus set the timer, then started messing with the exposed side panel.

“We’re gonna burn this thing out,” he said, “but it’ll do the job. Just don’t look through the screen—this creates a fair bit of plasma.”

Judy grabbed a welder’s mask and leaned over the microwave as it whirred to life. Marcus ducked down and pulled safety glasses from his hair.

The sound of the microwave was quickly drowned out by crackling and a high-voltage buzz. Arcs of light illuminated our dim surroundings, and in a flash the machine was dead. Judy wasted no time exhuming the canister. A torrent of smoke billowed from within, bringing the smells of carbon and fresh ozone. She carefully unlidded the container and poured its contents into a Home Depot bucket full of what I assumed was water. It hissed, and I heard a small clunk as the drop of molten liquid hit the bottom. How anything living or otherwise could survive that was beyond me.

While we waited for it to cool, Judy and Marcus tried their best to answer my questions as they sanitized the scene. Marcus had worked for the company for years—something he’d been brought into at college overseas. He promised he hadn’t been hanging out with me with the sole purpose of recruiting me, something I hadn’t even considered yet.

Judy was much less enthusiastic about conversation after the whole process. She had to be exhausted at that point. She admitted to bugging me with the listening device earlier to gauge how I reacted to the Nycto and to get a recording of the encounter, since the stuff apparently blocked most forms of radio communication.

It was almost five by the time we wrapped up, and with daylight and the threat of the shop’s actual inhabitants returning, we all agreed to head to a nearby diner. Judy pulled what she called a “Prince Rupert’s drop” from the bucket where it had been cooling. It was about the size of a mandarin orange—a clear bubble filled with a jet-black haze.

Once I’d sliced into my pancakes, I began to contemplate the undeniable fact that an entire secret government organization could not exist solely to mess with these glass blobs. I wondered then what else there was out there in the dark that I didn’t know about. For better or worse. I wouldn’t have to wait all that long. On the bright side, for the first time in my life I could leave a decent tip without even a second thought.",7,1764716840.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

It seems as though I’m losing my body. My face. My spirt, and my soul. And yet, not a single person knows.

Or at least they pretend not to.

You see, a few months ago, I was kidnapped.

Masked men came into my family home while I slept. They awoke me and I tried to scream, but it was too late. They had already clasped a strong hand over my mouth and were prepping a rag soaked in what I assumed was chloroform.

The tallest of the men held me down while his companions pressed the rag firmly against my face.

My vision started to swim and, no matter how hard I tried, I could not remain conscious.

I woke up periodically. I remember being in the back of what appeared to be a moving-truck, like a u-haul or something.

I remember the cold metal floor of the vehicle as I struggled and failed to find my bearings; the way the turns slid me around and knocked me against the walls.

The next thing I remembered was being dragged from the truck by the same masked men who took me. They pulled me across the floor like a butchered cow carcass, waiting to be cut into slabs of steak.

They actually just let me fall, straight to the ground, upon nearing the giant exit.

The fall caused me to smack my head against the concrete, knocking me fully unconscious yet again.

When I awoke a third time, I was tied to a chair. The room was dark, aside from the light of a projector that cascaded bright fluorescent light against the concrete wall.

I was stripped down to my underwear, which appeared to be stained with urine and sweat.

The room was absolutely freezing, and I felt my body shiver as goosebumps arose one by one across my body.

My head pounded from my fall and from the effects of the drugs I had been on. It took me a few moments to regain my full vision, and when I did, I noticed something that turned the blood in my veins to ice.

It was an operating table. Beside it, a cart lined with all manner of surgical tools.

This awoke something within me.

I began to struggle violently against my restraints, shaking and thrashing like a man possessed.

In the process I ended up falling over again, still tied to the chair. I heard a sickening SNAP as my bound wrist smashed against the concrete floor.

As I cried out in pain, the projector screen suddenly shifted, and began playing a video.

It was a video of my family home, in flames. The fire roared and reached out to touch the  heavens.

Firefighters worked diligently to ease the blaze, but it seemed as though the harder they fought, the more the fire blazed.

Black smoke billowed from my childhood home, and my eyes began to welt up with tears I’d never thought possible.

Then, just as quickly as it came, the video abruptly stopped, and the room went completely black.

And I sat there, alone and nearly completely naked in utter frozen darkness.

I was forced to be listen to my own thoughts for what felt like an eternity. I broke my own heart several times over, and by the end of everything, I had been defeated entirely.

I lay there, face soaked with tears, shivering on the cold floor, when the projection screen suddenly turned back on.

This time, it was showing footage of the local news.

“DEVASTATING HOUSE-FIRE LEAVES GAINESVILLE HOME DESTROYED- NO BODIES RECOVERED.”

I stared at the screen, and a small wave of relief washed over me. That feeling quickly dissipated, however, when  I realized: my parents had definitely been home at the time of my kidnapping.

My relief turned to confusion, then to dread.

As if responding to my thoughts, a single fluorescent light flicked on, stretching down and revealing a tarp under its illumination.

I felt bile rise in my stomach as the anxiety of what could lie beneath the tarp taunted me; forced a million different scenarios through my head.

My heart pounded in my ears, deafeningly, and the sheer magnitude of my sensory overload was making me dizzy, and nauseous.

I felt the puke pull its way from my stomach and up my throat, spilling out onto my bare chest and puddling onto the floor.

In response to this, every light flicked on in an instant. It was so blinding that it made it nearly impossible for me to see the armed guards that came filing into the room.

Their rifles were trained on me, and each officer had their shield raised, as though I was the one to be scared of.

The team of guards then parted, never taking their eyes off of me, to make room for the men in white coats and surgical masks.

Whilst two guards restrained me, the three men in white coats prepped their surgical tools.

The guards cut the ropes from my hands, and my arms fell limply to my side, aching and shot with pins and needles.

As if I were threatening in any sort of way, one of the guards yanked my wrists behind my back, shooting a white hot pain up through my entire right arm.

I screamed in agony and was answered with a punch to the face.

The guards slammed me down on the operating table before tightening the restraints around my wrists, one of which I was CONFIDENT was shattered.

Once they had tightened the straps around each of my limbs, one by one they began filing out of the room, just as they had came.

The room was now deafeningly silent.

I cringed at the sight of the doctors who seemed to be wrapping up their preparations.

One of them looked over his shoulders to glance at me.

His face was displayed a look of indifference.

A lack of any sort of conscience.

He had a job to do, and I was his business.

Finally, he turned to me.

As he approached, his two colleagues walked solemnly towards the tarp a few meters away.

They were the ones that had my attention.

I watched them all the way up until one of them grabbed the tarp by its edges and yanked on it, revealing what I feared the most.

My parents lay there, blue and stiff.

They were both completely nude, and each had a sliced wound that stretched across their neck from one ear to the next.

They were nearly decapitated.

I began to thrash against the restraints, screaming at the top of my lungs for somebody, please, anybody, please just help me.

The doctors just allowed me to scream.

They allowed me to cry and waste my energy.

I went on for 5 straight minutes before the head doctor fastened a gag in my mouth and muffled what little screaming I had left in me.

As my eyes darted around the room, exhaustedly, they found their way back to my parents and the two doctors.

As they analyzed the bodies with a disgusting lack of care, one of them then proceeded to pick my mother’s head off the ground before twisting it around in his hands, checking for abnormalities.

They hadn’t NEARLY been decapitated. They were.

Standing from his kneeling position, the other doctor then walked over and picked my father’s head from the ground, mimicking the process of his colleague.

I couldn’t help it anymore and began puking through the gag, praying that I’d drown in my own vomit.

That wish was vanquished, however, when for the first time, the head doctor showed urgency.

He quickly removed the gag before forcing my head up.

My vomit spilled all over my body and in that moment, I begged God for death.

The head doctor gave me a glance that was almost…disappointed… disgusted at what I had done to myself.

Without taking his eyes off me, he reached down and retrieved a bucket of ice cold water, which he then proceeded to splash directly on top of me.

The shock made me tense up against the restraints, and I felt my wrist throb in pain.

My agony blurred my vision and made it seem as though the other two doctors had appeared beside the head doctor out of nowhere.

Each of them held a severed head belonging to one of each of my parents.

I couldn’t help but stare at them.

Their jaws hung open, and their tongues seemed bloated and inhuman.

The gore that dripped from their necks nailed utter grief straight through my soul.

And you know what the doctors did?

They tossed them onto one of the surgical carts like they were nothing. Like they were dirty tools, in need of sterilization.

I had no energy left to fight. No energy left to struggle. And the doctors sensed that.

There seemed to be an ever so subtle decrease in the tension amongst them, and it tore me apart.

As if to throw a bag of salt in my massive gaping wounds, they began chit chatting amongst each other.

Laughing and gawking in a language that was foreign to me.

One of them then proceeded to play opera music from his phone. Neither of his colleagues objected and instead, it seemed as though it increased their focus.

Without anesthesia, they began poking at me. Sticking me with needles and carving at the flesh on my face.

I felt blood trickle down my face, turning into a full faucet of the crimson liquid that poured out and leaked onto the operating table.

I let out one final scream, prompting one of the surgeons to jump and cut deep into my forehead.

It was evident that this frustrated him. Anger sounds the same in many languages.

He ordered his colleague to take a pair of clamps and pinch them firmly against my tongue.

The jagged teeth bit down hard and immediately filled my mouth with the taste of copper and iron.

The head doctor saw this, and I swear to God, the fucker smirked at me, satisfied at how helpless I looked.

He then regained his concentration, and began carving again.

He slides along the outline of my face, dragging his scalpel with nearly laser-like precision.

Once he connected the outline, he took his gloved hands, and started to pull ever so slightly on the flaps of skin he had opened up.

The pain became too much, and I’m not ashamed to say that I blacked out.

My mind had shattered, and I no longer had the strength to remain conscious.

When I awoke, I could feel the slight pressure of bandages that wrapped around the entirety of my head.

They covered my nose and mouth, but left two small slits that allowed me vision.

And through those slits, I was able to see something.

Something that no man should ever see.

Hanging on display, right in front of the operating table, was my own face. Hollow and lifeless. It looked identical to a mask you’d find in a Halloween store.

To make matters worse, I found that I couldn’t move. No matter how hard I tried, it felt as though I was completely paralyzed.

I also found that I wasn’t alone in the room.

“So you’re awake.”

The deep Slavic accent jolted me and my eyes immediately darted to the right.

“Hello, my sweet little experiment.”

The head doctor was sitting alone in a chair watching me, casually drinking from a coffee mug.

“You see, little experiment, I am friends with very rich people. Filthy rich. Rich enough to make you, your entire family, poof- disappear.”

His words bounced around in my head like a parasite, trying to claw its way straight through to my cerebellum.

His mask was pulled down now, revealing a gruff looking face. He has a shadowy beard, and his eyes were like that of a great white shark.

“My friends, they want to play little game. They make you disappear, whole family disappear. But YOU, little experiment, YOU go back.”

For the fist time in what felt like ages, I found the courage to speak.

“Go back? Go back after everything that’s happened? You guys are just gonna…let me go?”

I began to laugh uncontrollably, almost impulsively.

“Oh no, buddy. Hahahahaha you’re gonna have to kill me here. I don’t care HOW rich your friends are, you WILL pay for this.”

The doctor began to chuckle, then he himself began to laugh uncontrollably.

“Oh no, little experiment, we don’t kill you. We kill your parents. You, we need ALIVE.”

We then stared at each other, all whilst he enjoyed his cup of coffee.

“Well, if it’s okay with you,” he joked, “we must continue on with experiment.”

He stood up briskly and clapped his hands together.

As he walked over, casually, back to his surgical tool cart, I found that my mother and father had also been stripped of their faces.

“No one believe you. They think you are, how do you say? Koo-koo?”

After slipping on his gloves, I watched in horror as he picked up my father’s face. He waved it in front of me, tormenting me with the gore.

He then played around with my mother’s face. Twirling it around like a toy. He made her and my father kiss, all while laughing and singing like a mad man.

Using a pair of sheers, he cut little patches out of each of their faces, placing each piece on his tool cart.

He cut their faces down until they were nothing more than a pile of puzzle pieces, scattered across the cart.

“This is my favorite part,” he announced, cheerily.

For the next 6 hours, he stitched together a brand new face out of the chunks of what were once the smiling faces of my parents.

The creation was grotesque, and absolutely menacing.

“Don’t worry my little experiment. You three will soon be together forever.”

He carefully began to unravel my bandages, the early wrappings getting stuck to the open wound in the process and pulling at exposed nerves.

“I will make you….BEAUTIFUL, again, eh?”

Placing his new face on top of where mine should’ve been, he shifted it around until it fit perfectly amongst the seams on my face that he had created.

Again, without anesthesia, he began stitching my parents to me.

I felt the needle be inserted each and every time, and all I could do was sob silently.

Once he finished the initial stitching, he took an even smaller needle, and sewed the eyelids to the flaps of skin that remained atop my eyes.

“Has to be believable, yes?”

Blacking out from the pain once again, I drifted into a dreamless sleep.

When I awoke, I was still strapped to that damn table.

My face throbbed in agony, and the fluorescent lights seemed to burrow down deep into my eyes.

I found that the guards had returned, and the doctors were nowhere to be seen.

Without warning, 3 guards scooped me up from the table and cuffed me to a wheelchair, which they then proceeded to push towards the exit.

They brought me back to the same truck, but my torment was not over.

They drugged me yet again.

This time, however, it was lab grade methemphetamine.

They shot it straight into my veins, and locked me back inside the dark box truck.

I was completely losing it, and quite literally felt as though I was in Hell during the entire journey.

Every turn caused me to tumble, and the paranoia made me feel like my heart was going to explode.

The men decided to dump me on the side of the road, like trash, after removing their handcuffs.

They gave me one final punch to the gut before getting in their truck and driving away, never to be seen again.

I wandered through town, looking more monstrous than I believed imaginable for a civilian.

I got numerous pitiful glances, and many people seemed to divert their eyes any time I came within their vision.

As I wandered around, looking disfigured and homeless, I noticed something.

A missing persons poster.

One with my name and face on it.

There were dozens of them pasted across town, on nearly every small business and grocery store.

Yet, no one saw me.

No one noticed me right in front of them.

I told them, I said, “That is me, I am the person on that poster,” and hardly received any acknowledgement whatsoever.

A police officer stopped me, and the hope that maybe FINALLY I could get some recognition or genuine help was dashed immediately when he fined me for loitering and public indecency. He looked at me with such judgement and my heart froze over.

I tried showing him, I tried pulling my false face off but all he did was restrain me. All these fucking restraints.

He cuffed me and took me to the station, and STILL no one knew who I was.

They labeled me as insane, a crazed junky off the streets.

They went as far as to hold me in jail until my court date.

The judge herself found me insane, and sentenced me to spend time in the local insane asylum.

I keep trying, I keep attempting to pull this face off but it just will not budge. The stitching must have been flawless because, now,  I can’t even get past a slight peeling of the skin without giving up.

I just need you all to believe me, I need you all to hear me, I need you all to SEE me.

I’m the boy from the missing person posters, please help me.",1,1764716778.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

1pcnknn,https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1pcnknn/stremio_community_subtitles_v050_update_are_we/,Stremio Community Subtitles - v0.5.0 UPDATE - Are we AIO yet?,"This is a **big update**, and probably the most important one so far.

**Version 0.5.0** introduces **multiple subtitle providers**, a full rewrite of the provider engine, and several quality-of-life improvements that make the addon much closer to an **all-in-one subtitle solution** for Stremio.

# 🚀 What’s new in 0.5.0

🔧 **Multiple Subtitle Providers (OpenSubtitles, SubDL, Subsource)**

Until now, the addon worked with a single external provider - OpenSubtitles.com.  
Starting today, you can connect **multiple providers at the same time**:

* **OpenSubtitles.com**
* **SubDL**
* **Subsource**

The provider system was rewritten from scratch to support proper plugin-style integration.  
Future providers can now be added without rewriting half the codebase.

**How it works:**

* ✔ Automatic search across all connected providers
* ✔ Manual subtitle selection from any provider
* ✔ Ability to **link** provider subtitles to a specific video version
* ✔ Optional preference for **ASS/SSA** subtitles for better formatting support (only available for SubDL and Subsource)

This makes matching far more accurate and helps the community database grow much faster.

🔧 **Quality-of-life improvements**

* [Advanced Upload](https://stremio-community-subtitles.top/account) now auto-selects your uploaded subtitle - *No need to manually pick it again after uploading.*
* Content ID is now preserved during advanced uploads - *Useful when uploading subs for a full season - you just need to increase the episode number.*
* ""**No subtitles available**"" is now disabled by default - *If you prefer the old behavior, you can re-enable it in account settings.*
* Optional ""**Prioritize .ass subtitles**"" setting - *If ASS/SSA subtitles are available, the addon can return it as the top choice for Stremio. Also configurable in account settings.*

# 🧠 Quick recap - what this addon does

Stremio on mobile, TV, and VR **cannot load external subtitle files**.  
This addon solves that - and does much more. It also integrates with external subtitle providers and offers a web interface for easy subtitle selection.

With **Stremio Community Subtitles**, you can:

* Upload subtitles for the video you're watching
* Use them instantly on **web, mobile, TV, VR, and desktop**
* Access subtitles uploaded by other users
* Connect to OpenSubtitles.com, SubDL, and Subsource
* Manually pick correct subtitles from any provider
* **Link** subtitles to a specific video version so future users get the correct one automatically
* Enjoy automatic subtitle matching for most files

(Real-time teammates finder for any game — Nintendo, PC, Xbox, PS4 coming soon)

Hey everyone!  
A lot of you have been waiting for the beta release of DingPlay, so here it is. I’ve been working solo on this project for a month now, using Flutter and Firebase and I’m finally ready to let you try it out and break it (gently 😄).

\-------------------------------------------

Create or join lobbies instantly.  
Each lobby has its own real-time chat so you can coordinate on the spot.

# ✅ Instant notifications for everything

* A friend invites you to a lobby? → You get notified
* Someone wants to join your lobby? → Notified
* New messages in your lobby chat? → Notified Everything happens instantly.

Stop posting “Here’s my friend code, add me pls 🙏”.  
DingPlay handles platform IDs automatically and in real-time inside the app.

# ⭐ Upcoming Premium Features

→ Whenever someone creates a lobby for one of them, you get an instant invite.

# ⭐ Cross&Play (experimental)

Maybe grab a coffee and play together IRL — your call 👀.

# 🧪 Beta Disclaimer & Known Bugs

Yep, it’s beta. Yep, bugs exist. Here are the main ones:

* ⚪ Random gray screen after tapping certain notifications. Not always, and it disappears if you just go back into the app.
* ⚪ Chat messages notify everyone — including you 🤦‍♂️ Will be fixed ASAP.
* ⚪ Error message when joining a lobby You’ll get the same error message whether:
   * you haven’t added the required friend code yet (normal), or
   * you’re already in another lobby (less normal). Just quit your current lobby and you’re good.
* ⚪ No “forgot password” feature (yet) Yeah. I got too hyped adding real features and completely forgot that one. It’s coming this week — for now, just… don’t forget your password 😂.

# 📲 How to Install the Beta

Since it’s beta, the APK is stored on my Google Drive.  
No worries: Google, Samsung, Xiaomi and others automatically scan APKs before installation.

You might need to:

* enable installation from unknown sources
* allow notifications (most devices ask automatically)

If notifications don’t work, check the app’s notification settings on Android.

# 🐛 Found a bug? TELL ME HERE.

This post is dedicated to gathering all problems so I can fix everything fast and prepare the official release.  
If something is unclear, badly placed, or confusing: tell me.  
You’re not dumb — people think differently, and I need your perspective to improve the app.

# 🎨 Design Notes

The UI is inspired by old Nintendo / retro vibes.  
Some elements aren’t fully consistent yet because this is an MVP:  
first we test the experience, THEN we polish the UI.

# 🕹️ Platforms & Games

For now: Nintendo platforms only (smaller database to start).  
Within 1 week:

* the 10,000 most played PC games,
* PS4,
* Xbox One will be added.

# 📘 Example Use Cases

# 🏝️ Animal Crossing: New Horizons

Need Miles, Bells, specific items?  
Create a lobby for ACNH, set 2–4 players, describe what you’re looking for.  
People join → you chat → you trade → you make new friends.  
You keep those friends on DingPlay for next time.

# 🕵️ GTA Online – Heists

Finding decent players for Heists is hell: trolls, AFKs, no one joining, etc.  
Now you can create a lobby specifically for the Heist you want to run.  
Problem solved.

# 📅 Release Timeline

If feedback is good and bugs get fixed quickly:

* Google Play V1: January 1st, 2026
* iOS version: February 1st, 2026

# 💬 Let’s build this together

I just can’t justify the price and the atomizer isn’t the best. Is there an Oakcha dupe that has the coffee-ish lavender smell like coffee break does? I know they have other dupes like fireplace MM dupe and Jazz Club MM dupe, but it doesn’t appear that they have one for coffee break. Is there one similar to it on Oakcha. I don’t mind if it’s different since again i’ve used this scent for aver 3 years and don’t mind switching it up. But i would like to keep it in the realm of baked good coffee lavendery scents you know?

I'm not sure how much would be appropriate if I do end up getting them both gift cards (I do have a budget of 500). I definitely know that I am NOT giving them cash because they'll will not use it for themselves.

1pcnh8w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pcnh8w,DeLonghi Evo not grinding coffee correctly and not making them into pucks.,"Okay so I’m just going to start off by saying that this coffee machine is not mine, but my parents. The day before my parents were making coffee and something happened with the grinder and it wasn’t grinding the coffee beans. It made a weird noise like it’s trying to grind something, but nothing was coming through. If that makes sense? Dad followed a video to fix it, I think he did take some things apart vacuumed the grinder, maybe there was something stuck I don’t know, and…it’s brewing coffee but I’m not entirely sure what he did. So now the coffee grounds are coming off more course, not really forming into pucks, and the coffee isn’t as full bodied and more watery. I don’t know if this is just a simple issue where I just have to turn the grinder knob to get it more fine (actually I’m not sure if the knob is even facing the right way) or if it is an issue with the grinder itself. I don’t want to start taking it apart and accidentally break it in an attempt to fix it. Not to mention I’m not sure if it’s still under warranty. We’ve never had an issue like this before. I’m sorry if this sounds like a silly question, but if this was something that belonged to me I’d have no issue digging my hands into it to figure out the issue but since it’s my parents I want to be more careful with it.",1,1764716498.0,DeLonghi,5,1.0,False
