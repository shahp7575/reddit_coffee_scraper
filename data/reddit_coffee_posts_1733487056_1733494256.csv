1h81uu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h81uu8/welcome_to_the_starlight_inn/,Welcome to the Starlight Inn,"I've worked at this hotel for a couple months now, but man, do I already have a great many WILD ass stories to share, I figure documenting these things online is probably the best course of action, seeing as most of my job involves sitting at a terminal with a halfway passable internet connection.

I suppose before I go any further I should introduce myself, hello! My name is JC. I'm from a small town in the middle of nowhere Oregon, hosting a population of about 500, nestled pretty deep in the mountain passes that separate the lush green of the Willamette National Forest and the desolate wasteland that leads into Idaho. In my quaint little town, there exists a lone gas station that still uses analog pumps, one school that teaches everything from Pre-K through High School, a grocery store that SOMETIMES gets it's deliveries within a week of when they're placed, and a police station with a whopping two officers (their names are Paul and Gary, all things considered, really nice guys!)

The hotel I work for is called the Starlight Inn, a hotel that so strangely contrasts the rest of this town. Something you need to know about where I live is that, upon entering, you will feel as though you've travelled back into the 1940s, seeing as that's about when everything here was built. Being as far out of the way as we are, we aren't exactly on the radar for real estate or commercial developers, hell, hardly anyone knows we even exist. This hotel though? It seemed to pop up out of nowhere three years ago. In comparison to the halfway dry-rotten houses, grocery store the size of maybe 3/4 of a basketball court and a gas station that doesn't even have an overhang, this hotel looks like it was ripped straight out of a sci-fi movie. Pristine white walls, with marble flooring and a pool so chlorinated the water inside your body feels cleaner even being near it.

I was going through our town's newspaper when I saw an ad that popped out at me:

**""The Starlight Inn is now hiring an Overnight Auditor, No Experience Necessary - $25/hr""**.

I'd just lost my job at the grocery store about a week prior, and this felt like it was too good to be true.

**""Just come in with your resume and ask for Isaac for an interview""**.

So I did exactly that. I got onto my shitty little laptop I bought from a Goodwill last year on a trip to the valley, opened up Microsoft Word, and quickly drafted quite possibly the worst resume anybody had ever seen. I'd never written a resume before, so I just put down ""Maelstrom Hills Grocery Store - Cashier (2020 - 2024)"", my name and phone number, and absolutely nothing else. No real formatting, no header, nothing. I printed this ""resume"" off and made my trek 30 minutes across and ever so slightly outside of town to this Art Deco anomaly that sat just far enough away to not completely distract every single person who lives here.

Upon entering, I was greeted by a man behind the front desk who was IMPECCABLY dressed. A solid black tuxedo, white tie, white gloves and a smile that almost seemed a bit TOO big. He asked if I was there to check in, to which I responded that I was here about the job listing, inquiring further if Isaac was around. He had responded in an unnervingly cheery tone that he was in fact Isaac, who then proceeded to hold out his hand almost expectantly, before clarifying that he wanted my resume. It was at this moment the reality of the situation hit me. I just walked into this spotless, almost futuristic looking hotel in dirty jeans, a polo with an ever-growing hole in the side and torn-up knock-off Timberland boots. I very sheepishly handed him my resume, expecting to be sent away without a second thought. Needless to say, you can imagine my surprise when the VERY NEXT thing he asked me was when I could come in for a fitting, as he wants all of his employees to adhere to the company's dress code and that meant I'd need a suit tailored.

The tailor process was pretty simple. I came in the day after the resume drop-off, and a man with a thick German accent took measurements from neck to toe. After the measurements, I was brought into Isaac's office, a fairly grandiose room with a mahogany desk, jet black leather chair that I'm fairly certain had a massage function, and.... although it could just be me, this room felt WAY bigger than it should have been. Not like TARDIS-level bigger on the inside, but just enough that it was worth noting. I was sat down across from Isaac and was passed a considerable stack of paperwork. NDAs out the ass, which I would imagine would be bizarre for a hotel, especially considering one of them was meant to render me unable to even acknowledge Isaac's existence to anyone else. What I DID notice, however, was the lack of documentation I SHOULD HAVE had to fill out. There were no tax documents, nothing to identify who I was, nothing. Just NDAs and waivers so thick you'd think I was signing on to work for Marvel.

Every night so far has been the same. I come in, I sit in the office, reconcile the frankly strange amount of transactions that come through for a hotel so far out of the way of EVERYTHING, I fill out the paperwork that comes with those reconciliations, I brew coffee every once in a while, the sun rises, and then I go home. I get paid every week, on Monday, like clockwork, exactly at 3 AM. I haven't seen Isaac since my orientation, which was fucking bonkers in and of itself, as you'll soon learn.

There's so much more I need to say, but for now I'll leave you with this:

Starlight Inn is a fucking WEIRD place. Not just because of it's eccentric manager, or it's uncanny appearance, or the weird CIA-level documentation I had to sign..

I don't know how to put it into words. Have you ever met someone that was just... off? You couldn't shake that feeling that something was just TERRIBLY wrong with them, and yet you couldn't explain why you feel that way?

Just imagine that feeling, but surrounding an entire building, almost as if it shouldn't exist.

My name is JC, I've been a night auditor for the Starlight Inn for two months, three weeks, six days.

And I have a very strong feeling tomorrow will be different.",2,1733493283.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Dear students,

I want to express my gratitude, *especially* to Lewis, for acting quickly and saving my life. It‚Äôs a relief to know that in critical times, our community comes together to support one another. I hold no resentment for the events that occurred, but maintain that rat poison and coffee don't make for a nice flavor profile. Naughty naughty.

u/DottedWriter, I understand the pressure to be acknowledged and the frustration when efforts go unnoticed. It‚Äôs clear that everyone here is deeply committed to their craft, but perhaps none as fervently as you. For that, I will not fault you. Passion, desire ... these things should be seen.

When deserved.

Regardless, something isn‚Äôt right with me since that morning, and as I find myself just outside my old classroom, watching through the window as you all enjoy Mr. Koch's celebratory cake, I have to denote the irony in feeling unseen at present. Everyone seems to notice Lewis' absence, for which he has me to thank, though that's neither here nor there. But no ... in spite of my constant peering, my presence remains unnoticed, as if I'm just a shadow lingering at the edge of your ""Welcome Back!"" celebration. Though my heart is broken, it's my mind that feels most peculiar. It burns with curiosity while I watch you and wonder about the cake. Does it have a nice flavor profile, dearies? How are your tummies?

Been Talking for a Year but He‚Äôs Barely Putting in Effort,"I met a guy on Tinder (27) last year. At f'm M (28), working as a corporate slave for a year now. Iirst, our conversations were just for fun, but eventually, we started developing feelings for each other, even though we hadn‚Äôt met yet. One time, I took the courage to invite him to meet, we went for coffee, and ended up sleeping together. But right after that, he suddenly became cold, and I didn‚Äôt know what the problem was. He just said he was busy, so I understood.

But now, the problem is that sometimes, he wouldn't message me for 3 days or even a week, and I feel like if you like each other, and the other person isn‚Äôt talking to you, you‚Äôre naturally going to feel worried. That‚Äôs why I tried to flood him with messages and calls, but instead of apologizing, he got mad and said he was busy. I understand, but it‚Äôs becoming too much.

The worst part is that he reprimanded me to pay him for the calls I made, or else he said he would leave me. So, I ended up paying him‚Äîaround 45k, but in small amounts. Sometimes, things are okay, but when I invite him to meet again, he always has an excuse. Imagine, in 1 year, we've only met twice, and one time didn‚Äôt even last 30 minutes. I can‚Äôt even follow him on his social media. We only talk on one messaging platform, and every time we fight, he always finds a way to blame me, even though he‚Äôs also at fault.

1h81qnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/comments/1h81qnz/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 06/12/2024**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of ‚Ç¨1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1h81q8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1h81q8y/my_toxic_mother_f76_tried_to_hit_me_and_i_decided/,My toxic mother ( F76) tried to hit me and I decided to go no contact,"First time posting on reddit. Hi everyone. This is going to be a long one and more like a rant really but I need some insight here just so I don't go insane in the head myself. I (39F) also have a sister, let's call her Dee (44F) and our piece of work mother Bee (76F). My father M(75M) is in the home for the elderly - this will be important later.

So for some context. Our mother is and has always been the general of the family. She's very stubborn, loves to play a martyr and is a professional victim. Myself and my sister, we're both living abroad - my sister is from a neighbouring country to the country where our mother currently lives and I live in England. My mother had a spine injury recently where she cracked one of ther vertabraes because she at her age of 76 and after her knees operation she found it a good idea to be climbing on a small ladder. We had workers coming over to fix something on our balcony and she was in the process of tidying it up. She didn't want to wait for us to get home which would be for my sister in a couple of weeks. I was planned to visit early February. There wasn't any carpet in the balcony and the ladder slipped from under her and she fell backwards from the height of aprox. 2 metres down on the stoned floor. She managed to stand up and call herself an ambulance. She didn't hit her head thankfully ( none of the post injury check ups suggested so, when she was being admitted and examined by the doctors in the hospital ). Mind you, we begged her time and time again not to climb on anything ever, due to her age and bad knees and also the fact that we're not at home with her and we cannot provide a prompt and direct care if anything happens. She should know better what difficulties she's causing not only to herself but also to us, who have our own lives as well and as I mentioned cannot come to her aid immediately. Anyway, so she was in the hospital for a week and they were able to keep her there for another two in a long term recovery wing, which helped greatly as I could plan for a journey home. My sister went there shortly after her injury when she was innitially admitted as my sister lives 7hour bus journey away. She would visit our mother during the visiting hours every day, and once it was decided they'll be able to keep her for those addtional 2 weeks my sister went back to her home and I booked the tickets to fly home for when she's going to be eventually discharged.

Fast forward to me caring for her at home. The ambulance brought her fine, they carried her upstairs. And for the next 7 days, everything was going fine. Then I started to feel tired and frustrated because our mum demanded that I'll talk to her all the time and pay attention. She would be waking me up from the sleep during the night as well, to go to the toilet as she needed an assistance with her corset to support her back. I'm able to go back to sleep once woken up like that, but it takes time and also I initially thought I'll be able to sleep it off during the day, but one, it's not the same, and two, she would need assistance during the day as well. I cooked, and we ate together and I was basically with her 24/7. I also slept and spent time in her bedroom. I would sneak out after she fell asleep in the evening and went to our living room to have some peace and quiet, journal a bit and recharge myself. But by that time I was already exhausted from the whole day of practically being a cook, an entertainer and her nurse. I was starting to get tired constantly which resulted in me being snappy and didn't want to talk to her. Also all she wanted to talk about was her hospital experience which I knew by heart by like a third day. How she suffered there, when in fact she was only facing the consequences for her stupid actions. I know she's my mother but I didn't feel sorry for her one bit, because this wasn't an accident. She willing put herself in that situation knowing what can happen, and how much she's putting herself in, as well as inconveniencing her children by being so reckless.

I was also having a chest infection and because I live abroad and don't have a doctor here I couldn't go for an appointment to get the antibiotics. I could have gone privately most likely but didn't want to spend the extra money because I was already taking most of these days as a "" carer's unpaid leave "". So I went to town on Wednesday because I needed to pick up some stuff for her at the pharmacy as well as do a bit of a shopping. I voiced messaged my sister, about the struggles I have, and that our mother is too demanding for being technically bedridded and that I don't have a few minutes to myself away from her, because when I leave, she's shouting after me, where I am and where I'm going. I simply went to the toilet, and I told her I'm going to the toilet and I was there for maybe 3-4 minutes and she already called out what's wrong and whether my stomach aches. I believe they call this "" monkey love"" ? And my mother def suffers from it, because she's just so unhealthily attached to both me and my sister but mostly me. She separated from our father who was a drunk and he's in a home for elderly at this present time in the same country my sister lives in. So she goes and visits him regurarly and she basically sorted out his living situation. He's pretty harmless now, but this is why I said this information will be important because I'm convinced our mother is jealous of the fact our father who nearly drank himself to death and basically failed us as a family gets the regular visits as opose to our mother who is now also living alone because me and my sister both visit 2-3 times a year, sometimes less sometimes more. My sister is a full time home office so she can work from home anywhere, my situation is a bit different - flexible wise and travel wise. My mother would often complain how our father won the lottery, regarding his situation ( he didn't, he's basically a vegetable now but he does have a care to him provided within the home) and she would always express how she'd wish for us to move in with her and we'd live like one happy little family. She even suggested to me once that we could share her pension. I love my mom, actually I don't know anymore, I guess I love her in a sense that I want her to be safe and healthy as much as she can be at her age. But after what happened and this is a behavioural pattern with her, I'm done. Me and my sister are both single and usually given our age it's a common thing that women by this age should be married with their own families. At least in our country this is a very traditional almost as a matter or fact. But that doesn't mean we should be spending our remaining years living with our mother. Frankly, I'd rather hang myself. Our mother is special and there is no truth with her, only her truth.

Basically what happened was, I decided to talk to my mother about the time schedule, and how to balance our day or night for that matter and if I only knew what's that going to unleash, I'd rather bit my tongue through and through. She twisted everything, saying that she thought I knew I wasn't expecting this to be a holiday trip but that I came home to take care of her. She continued on saying how she expected a totally different level of care. ( Mind you, I went to toilet with her when she needed, wiped her ass, changed her diapers, cooked fresh meals almost every day, kept the flat clean, she always had a mornnig coffee and a treat, her meds on time, I was by her bed like a fucking dog 24/7 appart from those 3-4 hours once she fell asleep, I even took my laptop home so she doesn't lose the TV experience and I kept her company. I also got her 2 bouques of flowers and put them by her bed when she came in, and I also brought my little star projecting astronaut for her from England to create us a lovely atmosphere. I know it's a silly detail but I still believe that effort counts.) Perhaps she expected a red carpet to be rolled out every single time she went to the toilet, I don't know. She also said, the flat was a mess ( it wasn't, because I dusted and hoovered every single room before they brought her and the dishes that got used got cleaned right afterwards or the following morning. ) When I asked her what she ment by a "" different type of care "" she began to say that ok, my sister works from home, but I don't so she was expecting me to be cleaning and tidying up the flat more. Question 1. how the hell does this even remotely falls under caring for a person? Question 2. Did she expect me to do all the caring for her, be available to her 24/7 and to clean the flat in my spare time, because that would clearly make her feel better as well as it would solve the situation of my spare time. So by that logic if she can't have me at her disposal all the time, I should spend the time cleaning. Sorted. I am no fucking real life Cinderella but in that moment I sure started to feel like one. She knew she had nothing to prove that I didn't care for her so she started to grasp at straws. Everything good that I did, she turned against me.

After that she completely lost it. I tried to reason with her politely but she wouldn't have it, and I realised there was no point as she would twist my every word to fit her truth. Here are some of the lovely things I wish no child ( no matter how old ) should ever hear from their dearest mother:

1. She called me "" fake"" and she said my tears were "" fake"" and she doesn't believe me.
2. Since I was having the chest infection and was coughing loudly occasionally, she would tease me sarcastically to open up the window. ( I used to like to open the window to let in some fresh air, because it was two of us in a small room and also the air in there was dry which I believe irritated my throat as well. ) To me this was the perfect example of "" kick someone while they're already down "" and the fact that she as a mother showed a malicious joy over her own child struggling is disgusting.
3. She kept running her own pity party, and that she should've rather died and everyone would be happy. That I don't give a crap about her and all I want is to fuck off back to England and not having a care in the world about what happens to her. The usual rhetoric of a professional victim.
4. She said that I didn't want to let her know of my whereabouts while I was in town, and didn't let her know, and that she could be head facing the floor and I didn't care. ( My data bundle wasn't working and I even called my sister to let our mom know that I'll be home in 20 minutes.) Even if she was in danger at home, I still wouldn't be able to help her now would I?
5. She accused me of being "" fake "" again this whole time, and that it was just a fasade on my part. And that when I was a baby she also just didn't feed me and took care of me and then left me in the crib. Hm..really? Because I believe that's what mother normally do, they take care of the baby and place it back in a crib. They don't have to sit around that baby 24/7. Also I was a baby, and she's an adult. I told her that I wasn't asking to be brought into this world. And that if she had me as some kind of a leverage or that I was indebted to her so that she'll be taken care of when she's old she should've rather abort me. My life and my sparte time doesn't automatically belongs to her just because she's my mother.
6. When I told her that I've enjoyed taking care of her and I enjoyed cooking for her, she said I only enjoyed it because I was cooking for myself too. So I don't know whether she wanted me to just be cooking for her and for me to eat bread and water or whether to just watch her and not eat anything.

There were another incidents where she'd hide her pills under her pillow and when I asked what she had there ( as I couldn't see at that time, as I just walked into the room ) she said "" nothing "" to which I did raise my voice and asked why is she lying to me? I also apologised to her twice for raising my voice. But when she yelled at me later on and I asked whether that's ok she said yes, because she's my "" mother"" and is older.

Another incident happened later that day, when I was laying on the bed next to her crying myself to sleep, and she literally played music on her little radio. Tell me that's not psychotic.

Later she would began to kick me out of her bedroom, violently tugging on all my electronic's cables I had brought there for the laptop and she was like possesed, so angry and would not let go, because the part of the cable got stuck under the bed. So I shouted at her to let me do it, and I tried to push her hand a little but missed as she pulled her hand away and she looked at me with these wild eyes and began to scream that I hit her, and she tried to hit me twice calling me a little runt and who do I think I am to be hitting her. I didn't even touch her hand because she moved it, but claimed I hit her. That was the point where I no longer wanted to be part of anything and I just wanted to leave the situation. It brought back flashbacks when I was a child and she would hit me sometimes when I misbehaved but this was the same rush of feelings. I was terrified of her. Me at my nearly 40 years old and my practically bedridden 76 year old mother was teriffying to me just like in those days when I was a child.

I spoke with my sister on the phone and because I was too shaken from the situation she called the police for me and then I spoke with the person from the health emergency unit. I explained the situation to them, and they wanted to speak to my mother, and long and behold. My mother was suddenly composed in her bed, flat out lying to the lady on the speakerphone that I took her meds and wouldn't give it to her while she smirked at me. She smirked at me. Straight into my pathetic, worried and frustrated crying face. I suddenly felt as if I was a part of some psycho movie with a sad difference that this was unfortunatelly my reality now. I told my mom how can she be lying like this, blaming her own daughter when in fact she was being stubborn and didn't want to take the meds from me. I ended the call and gave her the meds which were out on a display whenever she needed them in a hallway. I did take them from her initially because I wanted to serve her them and I was also concerned she may overdose giving the escalated situation. I would never withold medication from my mother. Those were only tablets for the pain and her high blood pressure. She's not taking anything for her head. That's why I wanted to see if the ambulance couldn't take her to keep her overnight or at least untill my sister returns, because she wouldn't take anything from me, was uncooperative and wouldn't accept any aid or meds or food from me. She was supposed to be wearing this corset to help her keep upright and spine straight but she needs an assistance with it. So instead of swallowing her pride she's risking her own health but endangering herself further. And of course I'll be the one to blame. The lady on the phone told us, she can't do anything if my mom doesn't ask for an ambulance and that I can't force the medical treatment on her even if it's for the reason to keep her safe. And everytime I wanted to help her, she'd yell at me to go away and that she doesn't want anything from me.

So I was pretty much left with an unstable, vindictive and scary mother in a flat, and having to be with her for a next day and a half and a whole night until my sister would arrive on Friday morning. I will never forgiver her for the stress she put me through having to fear every minute of these past 2 days whether she's going to hurt hurself, plus her malicious lying and just the shear entitlement and audacity to treat me like her personal slave when all I wanted was to just have a few hours of the day to myself. I tried to explain to her, that even nurses aren't obligated to stay by the patient's bed every minute of the day, and I couldn't understand why she would expect me to do that. She is my mother but that doesn't mean I owe her my time. I took care of her the best way possible, and ironically the things I dreaded the most like changing her diaper pants and going to toilet with her, proved to be a piece of cake unlike the way she treated me mentally. To me she's an actress that will always give these oscar worthy performances and she'll never learn her lesson. She said that herself, she's not going to change and is expecting us to just accept her outrages, scarry and awful awful behaviour, because she's of a certain age. This is not the first instance where she lied and me and my sister we're both suspecting her of faking her pain levels so that we pity her. I knew she needed to make that performance because she had nothing in her hands to prove I didn't treat her right so she would rather "" fake suffer "" even though the help was right there, just so that she could tell I left her alone, and without help. I confessed this to my sister as well, and she also told me, this could very well be the case because she also knows of her jealousy over our dad's visits.

I don't want anything to do with her. Not after this. I would support her financially if need be, but I refuse to even look at her now, or to be in one space with her alone. She completely changed once my sister got home, she was fine, her voice was no longer sulky and whiney, or hyperventilatiing and she didn't look to be in pain. As I said, performance of the year. Now that she most likely realises her big mistake going off on me like that, it got to her head that she only now has my sister that is willing to care for her. She should be walking again in a 2-3 weeks time, so she'll need less and less assistance and now was my sister's turn to care for her anyway, but I don't think my mother realises that the sharade she performed will cost her one of her daughter's relationship. Because there is no way, I'm forgiving her this torment nor will I be forgetting even if I wanted to as it's engraved in my memory forever.

So please Reddit, tell me, would I be the asshole for completely cutting my mother off? Has any of you went through any mental and physical abuse from your mother and what are your thoughts or how you managed to heal or/and move on. Apologies for the length, but a lot has happened so I needed to write it all. Thank you and have a lovely day everyone.",3,1733492902.0,toxicparents,1,1.0,False

This workshop will, building on recent work, explore topics at the intersection of pragmatism and philosophy of science, examining how pragmatism sheds light on scientific practice, success, and the interplay between metaphysics and epistemology. By bringing together leading philosophers with a shared interest in pragmatism across diverse disciplinary backgrounds, we aim to foster the ongoing development of this promising area of inquiry.

After a relaxing evening at Ashvem Beach, I woke up at 7:00 AM to an unexpected hiccup‚Äîa fully punctured tire. Thankfully, I borrowed a tire inflator from my jiju‚Äôs Nexon, which saved the day. After inflating the tire, I quickly got it repaired and set off at 9:30 AM toward the mysterious Yana Caves in Karnataka.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of Day 2:


---

Route Overview

Goa ‚Üí Karwar ‚Üí Yana Caves ‚Üí Gokarna ‚Üí Honnavar
This leg of the journey covers picturesque coastal stretches, challenging ghat roads, and serene beaches.


---

Road Conditions & Highlights

1. Goa to Karwar (Crossing into Karnataka):

The drive from Goa to Karwar involves crossing the Goa-Karnataka state border, which is a seamless process.

There‚Äôs a small checkpoint at the border, but no major stops or formalities unless there‚Äôs a specific inspection underway.

The road is a two-lane highway but well-maintained and scenic, offering glimpses of the Arabian Sea.

Traffic is moderate, and you can maintain a steady pace of 60-70 km/h.



2. Karwar to Yana Caves:

After Karwar, the road condition starts to deteriorate.

The approach to Yana Caves includes a 10 km stretch of rough roads through hilly terrain, requiring slow and careful driving.

You‚Äôll encounter a mix of ghats, narrow lanes, and occasional potholes.

Despite the challenges, the drive is scenic, with dense forests and quiet surroundings.



3. Yana Caves to Gokarna:

The road from Yana Caves to Gokarna is perhaps the most difficult part of this stretch.

It‚Äôs riddled with bad patches, and ground clearance becomes a concern.

I had to drive cautiously to prevent my Skoda Superb from scraping the road.



4. Gokarna to Honnavar (via NH66):

A welcome relief after the tough roads near Yana and Gokarna!

The NH66 stretch is smooth, with wide lanes and minimal traffic, allowing for a relaxed drive.





---

Key Stops & Experiences

1. Yana Caves:

Reached Yana around lunchtime. The caves are a hidden gem surrounded by dense forests and fascinating rock formations.

You‚Äôll need to park your car and hike about 500 m to reach the caves‚Äîa refreshing yet slightly tiring experience.



2. Gokarna - Om Beach:

Arrived at Om Beach around 5:30 PM.

Witnessed another mesmerizing sunset, enjoyed a steaming cup of coffee, and had some light snacks by the beach.

Om Beach is tranquil and perfect for unwinding.



3. Honnavar:

Reached Honnavar around 8:30 PM and sampled some delicious local cuisine.

Slept early to wake up for the much-anticipated Sharavati River boat ride the next morning.





---

Sharavati River Boat Ride

Waking up at 5:30 AM was worth it! The boat ride on the Sharavati River was an incredible experience, offering peaceful views of the backwaters surrounded by lush greenery. The stillness of the early morning, combined with the gentle movement of the boat, was truly mesmerizing.


---

Quick Facts About the Route

Total Distance Covered: ~330 km

Travel Time: ~11 hours (including stops and sightseeing)

Road Quality:

Goa to Karwar: Good

Karwar to Yana Caves: Average (10 km bad stretch near Yana)

Yana to Gokarna: Poor

Gokarna to Honnavar: Excellent




---

Food & Fuel Stops

Lunch Stop: Midway after Karwar‚Äîthere are several small eateries serving local food.

Fuel: Top up at Goa as fuel is cheaper in Goa ( both CNG and petrol). You wont find many CNG pumps in Karwar but you will find it along the NH66 and near Gokarna.

---

This leg of the journey tested my driving skills, especially navigating the rough roads near Yana Caves and Gokarna
but the stunning views of Yana Caves, the tranquil beauty of Om Beach in Gokarna, and the peaceful Sharavati River in Honnavar made every challenge worthwhile.


Stay tuned for Part 3: Honnavar to Udupi via Murudeshwar, where I‚Äôll explore the iconic Shiva statue, enjoy coastal vibes, and dive into the culinary delights of Udupi.

1h81fqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1h81fqm/my_wellme_biovanish_review_and_rating_comparison/,My Wellme Biovanish review and rating: Comparison with other Keto supplements!,"If you‚Äôve been struggling to lose weight on keto or want to get the benefits of ketosis without going super low-carb, BioVanish claims to give you those advantages in a convenient drink mix. But does it live up to the hype? Let‚Äôs find out!

[**BioVanish**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/biovanish.php) **is designed** to support your body‚Äôs production of **BHB** (beta-hydroxybutyrate), which is a key ketone that helps you burn fat for energy. The supplement claims to offer a ‚Äú**dairy farm method**‚Äù for weight loss by providing **9-c fats**, which reportedly boost your **BHB levels** more efficiently than traditional methods like fasting or following a ketogenic diet.

In addition to BHB, BioVanish contains other natural ingredients like **MCT coconut extract** and **B-vitamins**, which work together to enhance fat-burning, increase energy, and control cravings.

# What is BioVanish?

* If you're familiar with the ketogenic diet, you know that ketosis is the state where your body burns **fat** instead of carbohydrates for energy.
* **BioVanish** is a drink mix designed to help your body achieve and maintain ketosis without the need for an extreme low-carb diet.
* Getting into ketosis and staying there is tough, especially if you accidentally consume more carbs than planned. This is where BioVanish steps in.
* The key to BioVanish‚Äôs effectiveness is its use of **9-c fats**‚Äîa type of medium-chain fatty acid extracted from coconut oil. These fats trigger your body to produce more **BHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate)**, a ketone that naturally increases during ketosis.
* Higher **BHB levels** mean your body is more likely to burn fat, even if you‚Äôre not following a strict keto plan. BioVanish‚Äôs formula claims to mimic the effects of ketosis, allowing you to enjoy fat-burning benefits without having to drastically limit carbs.
* Additionally, the formula includes **L-theanine** (for stress relief and better sleep) and **B-vitamins**, which are essential for energy metabolism and overall health.

**First-Hand Look at Wellme Biovanish**

If you‚Äôre looking for a weight loss supplement that doubles as a metabolism booster and energy enhancer, **Wellme Biovanish** has some solid potential. The ingredients are thoughtfully chosen, blending energy-boosting MCTs with calming L-Theanine and essential vitamins like B6, B12, and Folate.

**Where It Shines**

1. **MCTs for Energy and Ketosis Support** With **5 grams of MCT powder** sourced from coconut oil, this product is a great choice if you‚Äôre trying to stay in ketosis or need a quick energy boost. MCTs are known to convert directly into energy, so they can help you power through workouts or even mid-afternoon slumps. For anyone on a keto diet, this is a welcome addition.
2. **Mood and Focus with L-Theanine** Stress eating can be a major obstacle when it comes to weight loss. L-Theanine‚Äôs inclusion is a thoughtful touch‚Äîit promotes relaxation and mental focus without making you drowsy. If you‚Äôre someone who juggles a lot of stress, this might help you stay on track with your health goals.
3. **Essential Vitamins for Energy and Metabolism** The combination of Vitamin B6, Folate, and B12 is a solid foundation for supporting energy production and cognitive health. Many weight loss supplements skimp on vitamins, but these are crucial for keeping you mentally and physically sharp while cutting calories.
4. **Low-Calorie Sweetening with Stevia** I appreciate that they used Stevia as a sweetener. It‚Äôs a good alternative to artificial sugars and doesn‚Äôt spike blood sugar. Plus, the chocolate flavor is a nice touch‚Äîit makes the product feel more like a treat than a chore.

**Where It Falls Short**

1. **Dextrose Raises Questions** While dextrose is a common ingredient, it‚Äôs a form of sugar. For a product aimed at supporting fat loss and ketosis, this might raise some eyebrows. Even if it‚Äôs a small amount, it feels a bit out of place in a keto-friendly product.
2. **Artificial Chocolate Flavor** While the flavor is likely pleasant, the use of artificial chocolate flavor might not sit well with those who prefer clean, natural ingredients. If you‚Äôre sensitive to synthetic additives, this could be a drawback.
3. **No Magic Bullet** Like any supplement, **Wellme Biovanish** isn‚Äôt a miracle product. It works best when combined with a proper diet (preferably low-carb or keto) and exercise. If you‚Äôre expecting it to shed pounds on its own, you might be disappointed.

**Who Might Benefit from BioVanish MCT powder**

* If you‚Äôre new to keto and struggling with energy dips, the MCTs could help you transition more smoothly.
* If stress eating derails your progress, the calming effects of L-Theanine might give you better control.
* If you‚Äôre looking for a weight loss supplement that doesn‚Äôt rely on harsh stimulants, this one offers a gentler alternative. **Anther non stimulant fat burner we really recommend here is** [**HourGlass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php)**.** 
* [**Here is a review**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1ggd31w/my_hourglass_fit_review_comparison_with_other/) **of Hourglass Fit.**

**Final Verdict: Does it work?**

Okay Wellme Biovanish has a lot going for it‚Äîespecially the thoughtful mix of MCTs, vitamins, and stress-relief elements and **I rate it at 4/5.** It‚Äôs a solid choice if you‚Äôre already working on your diet and exercise routine and want something to support your efforts. However, the inclusion of dextrose and artificial flavors could be improved to make it more universally appealing.

If you‚Äôre looking for a convenient, keto-friendly product that gives you an energy boost while supporting weight loss, this one is worth a try.

When it comes to **BioVanish**, the big question is: will it *really* help you lose weight? The answer isn‚Äôt a simple yes or no‚Äîit kinda depends on what you‚Äôre expecting. If you think it‚Äôs a magic pill to melt fat without lifting a finger, you‚Äôre gonna be disappointed. The MCT powder can boost energy and help you burn fat more efficiently, especially if you‚Äôre already following a low-carb diet.

Plus, **the stress-reducing L-Theanine and B vitamins** are nice bonuses for keeping your head in the game. But here‚Äôs the thing: like most weight loss supplements, it‚Äôs a sidekick, not the hero. You still need to watch your carb intake and stick to the basics‚Äîcalorie control and regular exercise.

Now, there‚Äôs some skepticism about these kinds of products. A lot of people feel keto supplements like this are just overpriced hype, and honestly, I get where they‚Äôre coming from. Some argue you don‚Äôt need external sources like MCTs because your body can naturally produce ketones during ketosis.

But on the flip side, if you‚Äôre someone who struggles with energy dips or keeping ketosis steady, BioVanish could give you a bit of an edge. At the end of the day, it *might* help you lose weight, but only if you‚Äôre putting in the work on your diet and lifestyle. It‚Äôs not a quick fix, but it could be a helpful tool to keep you on track.

# Ingredients

**1. Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCTs) Powder (from Coconut Oil)**

MCTs are a type of fat that is rapidly absorbed and converted into energy, making them ideal for boosting metabolism and supporting ketosis. Sourced from coconut oil, MCTs are commonly used in keto diets for quick energy and fat burning.

**2. L-Theanine**

# L-Theanine is an amino acid found primarily in green tea, known for its calming effects and ability to reduce stress. It promotes relaxation without causing drowsiness and is often used to improve focus and sleep quality

**3. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)**

Vitamin B6 is essential for brain health and plays a crucial role in mood regulation and cognitive function. It also aids in the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.

**4. Folate (from 784 mcg Folic Acid)**

Folate, a form of Vitamin B9, is critical for DNA synthesis and cell division. It is especially important for pregnant women as it helps prevent neural tube defects in developing babies.

**5. Vitamin B12 (Cyanocobalamin)**

Vitamin B12 is vital for maintaining healthy nerve cells and producing DNA and red blood cells. It also plays a key role in energy production and preventing anemia.

**6. Dextrose**

Dextrose is a simple sugar made from corn and chemically identical to glucose. It is often used as a sweetener and to quickly raise blood sugar levels.

**7. Natural & Artificial Chocolate Flavor**

Natural chocolate flavor is derived from real cocoa beans, offering a rich taste while maintaining natural properties. Artificial chocolate flavor mimics the taste of chocolate but is created synthetically to enhance flavor consistency.

**8. Salt**

Salt, or sodium chloride, is an essential mineral that helps maintain fluid balance in the body. It is also used to enhance flavor in food products.

**9. Stevia Leaf Extract**

Stevia is a natural sweetener derived from the leaves of the *Stevia rebaudiana* plant. It is often used as a sugar substitute because it has zero calories and does not raise blood sugar levels.

**10. Silicon Dioxide**

Silicon dioxide, also known as silica, is a naturally occurring compound found in many foods. It is commonly used in supplements to prevent clumping and improve product stability.

# How to Use BioVanish for Optimal Results

* **Consistency is key** to getting the most out of BioVanish.
* Take BioVanish **daily** to support your body in maintaining **ketosis**.
* Mix **one scoop** of BioVanish with **8 ounces of water**, milk, or a milk alternative‚Äîwhatever you prefer.
* Many find it helpful to take BioVanish in the **morning** to kickstart the day, while others use it as an **afternoon pick-me-up** for energy.
* Pair BioVanish with a **low-carb** or **keto-friendly diet** for optimal results.
* The supplement works best when you‚Äôre mindful of your **carb intake** but doesn‚Äôt require strict dietary restrictions.
* Focus on a diet **high in healthy fats** and low in **refined carbs** to boost BioVanish‚Äôs fat-burning potential.
* BioVanish helps **keto followers** avoid the **keto flu** and boosts energy.

# How MCT Oil in BioVanish Supports Weight Loss

* **MCT oil** stands for **Medium-Chain Triglycerides**, a type of fat primarily derived from **coconut oil**.
* What makes **MCT oil** unique is that it‚Äôs **rapidly absorbed by the liver** and converted into **ketones**, providing a quick source of energy.
* These **ketones** help keep your body in **ketosis**, the fat-burning state that is the goal of the **keto diet**.
* **MCT oil** helps your body stay in **ketosis**, even if you‚Äôre not strict with your carb intake, ensuring your body continues to burn **fat for energy** instead of glucose.
* Studies show **MCT oil** can also **increase metabolism**, boosting calorie burning even when you're at rest, which can lead to faster weight loss.
* Another benefit is that **MCT oil** can help **control hunger** by promoting feelings of fullness, making it easier to avoid overeating and control cravings.
* This is especially helpful for those on **low-carb diets** who struggle with mid-day snack attacks.
* **BioVanish** uses **MCT coconut extract** to provide a **high-quality**, effective source of MCTs, ensuring consistent ketone production.
* Whether added to coffee, smoothies, or water, the **MCT oil in BioVanish** supports **fat-burning**, **metabolism**, and **appetite control**, making it a powerful aid for weight loss.

# The Role of BHB and 9-c Fats in BioVanish

* **Ketosis** is powered by **ketones**, with **BHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate)** being one of the most important ketones produced by the body.
* Achieving ketosis can be difficult, and that‚Äôs where supplements like **BioVanish** come in to help enhance your body's production of **BHB**.
* **BioVanish** uses **9-c fats**, special fats derived from **coconut oil**, which have been shown to increase **BHB production** more effectively than a strict keto diet alone.
* **9-c fats** help keep the body in **fat-burning mode**, making them essential for maintaining ketosis.
* When in **ketosis**, the liver breaks down fats to produce **BHB**, which serves as an energy source for cells. The more **BHB** your body produces, the more efficiently it burns fat.
* Maintaining high **BHB levels** can be tough, especially if your carb intake fluctuates. **BioVanish's 9-c fats** are quickly converted into **ketones**, including **BHB**, helping you stay in ketosis even with occasional carb intake.
* In addition to fat-burning, **BHB** also helps **suppress appetite**, making it easier to control cravings and stick to a weight loss plan.
* **BHB** provides a steady source of **clean energy**, helping avoid the energy crashes that come with high-carb diets.
* If you feel sluggish or foggy on keto, it‚Äôs likely because your body isn‚Äôt producing enough **BHB**. **BioVanish** gives your body a **BHB boost**, keeping energy levels high while burning fat.
* The combination of **BHB** and **9-c fats** in **BioVanish** makes it an effective tool for those on keto, offering a natural and sustained approach to ketosis compared to other supplements.
* Whether you‚Äôre new to keto or an experienced dieter, **BioVanish** can help you achieve your weight loss goals more effectively by supporting your body‚Äôs natural ability to produce **BHB**.

# What makes BioVanish unique?

From **MCT oils** to **BHB salts**, each product claims to boost ketosis and help you shed pounds. So, how does **BioVanish** stack up against the competition?

* **A natural approach:** One key feature is its use of **9-c fats** from coconut oil, which help your body naturally produce more **BHB**‚Äîthe ketone responsible for fat-burning. Unlike supplements that provide synthetic BHB, BioVanish promotes natural **ketone production**, leading to more sustainable fat-burning.
* Research from the **University of Auckland Nutrition Center** revealed that **9-c molecules** can significantly raise **BHB (beta-hydroxybutyrate) levels**, even more than a strict **keto diet**.
* **Convenient:** Instead of swallowing pills or measuring out powders, you simply mix one scoop of the drink mix with water or a milk alternative. It‚Äôs easy for everyone.
* **Extra benefits:** The added ingredients like **L-theanine** and **B-vitamins** give it an edge by **supporting energy** and stress relief, something most other keto supplements don‚Äôt offer.

*If you're looking for a* ***keto-friendly supplement*** *that not only helps you stay in ketosis but also boosts your energy and supports long-term fat loss,* ***BioVanish*** *could be one of the best options available. Its blend of* ***MCTs*** *and* ***9-c fats*** *gives it a unique approach compared to traditional supplements, making it a strong contender in the world of keto weight loss products.*

# My final Performance Evaluation (Ratings)

# Appetite Suppression: 3.5/5

The **MCT oil** in BioVanish has been shown to help with **appetite control** by promoting satiety and keeping hunger at bay. However, the added sugars in the product might limit its full potential for those looking for strict appetite suppression.

# Metabolism Boost: 4/5

The **MCT oil** and **9-c fats** help to **boost metabolism** by increasing your body‚Äôs ability to burn fat more efficiently. This is especially beneficial for those on a **keto diet**, as it can help speed up the process of entering and maintaining **ketosis**.

# Energy Enhancement: 4/5

With the inclusion of **MCTs** and **B-vitamins**, BioVanish provides a steady source of energy, making it great for avoiding the typical afternoon energy crashes. **BHB production** also helps deliver consistent, clean energy, especially for those on low-carb diets.

# Fat Burning: 4.5/5

The **9-c fats** and **MCTs** in BioVanish help optimize **BHB levels**, making it one of the more effective supplements for enhancing **fat-burning**. The ability to promote fat as a primary fuel source gives it a solid edge for those looking to lose weight.

# Safety Profile: 4/5

Overall, **BioVanish** uses natural ingredients like **MCT oil**, **L-theanine**, and **B-vitamins**, which are generally safe for most users. However, the presence of added sugars may not align with stricter keto plans, and some individuals may need to monitor their tolerance to the ingredients.

# Price/Value for Money: 3.5/5

While **BioVanish** offers high-quality ingredients and multiple benefits, it is on the pricier side compared to other keto supplements. However, the added convenience and unique formulation may justify the cost for users who prioritize ease of use and comprehensive support.

# Ease of Use: 5/5

**BioVanish** is extremely easy to use since it comes in a convenient **drink mix** form. You just mix one scoop with water, milk, or a milk alternative, making it much more user-friendly compared to pills or complex powders that require measuring. It fits seamlessly into any daily routine, whether it's added to your morning coffee or a post-workout shake.

# BioVanish vs Other Keto supplements : List of Users this product is best for ‚Äì Who should try BioVanish?

**When it comes to** [**Wellme Biovanish**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/biovanish.php) versus your standard keto BHB supplements, it really depends on what you're looking for. Biovanish doesn‚Äôt focus on BHB salts like **Perfect Keto** or **Real Ketones**, so it‚Äôs not about replenishing ketones directly. Instead, it **uses MCT powder** to boost energy and fat metabolism, which is great if you‚Äôre someone who wants more natural energy without the sodium overload that BHB supplements can sometimes bring. 

On the other hand, brands like **Perfect Keto** are solid if you‚Äôre trying to recover from a carb slip or want something to mix into your coffee. If you‚Äôre into fruity flavors, **Ketologic** is a fun option, but Biovanish‚Äôs chocolate flavor is a treat if you‚Äôre more about dessert vibes.

**The real standout difference?** Biovanish has extras like **L-Theanine** for stress relief and B vitamins for energy, so it‚Äôs a bit of a multitasker compared to the straightforward ketosis-support of something like **Keto Boom**. 

That said, if you‚Äôre managing specific issues like kidney health, **KetoCitra** might be a better pick because it‚Äôs more tailored for therapeutic needs. 

But if you‚Äôre looking for a supplement that doesn‚Äôt lean on BHB salts, feels less ‚Äúclinical,‚Äù **relies on MCT powder** and gives you that energy boost with some mood support, Biovanish might be your jam. Just keep in mind, it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúone size fits all,‚Äù and like any keto product, it‚Äôll work best with a solid low-carb diet.

# Go for BioVanish:- 

**If you are following a keto diet but struggle to stay in ketosis**

* BioVanish supports your body's **BHB production**, helping you stay in ketosis even if you occasionally consume more carbs than intended.

1h81czh,https://i.redd.it/ncunxp10d85e1.jpeg,Every single time.,"I wanted to post this because I'm beyond frustrated at this point. I'll try to explain as best I can but I apologise in advance.

Basically this is an island where left lane is straight and right. Right lane is right only.

I've tried to highlight on my shitty diagram a regular occurrence while driving on the island. 

Pretty much every time on go around in the left lane, I either get someone trying to go straight over from the right only lane on the first exit, or driving around an then cutting completely into the left lane on the second exit. It has happened multiple times where I've had to literally slam my brakes on to avoid a collision!

Some people will say ""just use the right lane"" - Mostly I do, but if traffic is bad I'm a believer in using the road space that is available to help keep traffic flowing. 

I'm only posting this because the last 3 or 4 times I've gone around in the left lane one of the above has happened.

Another thing to note is that there must be at least 6 signs, as well as road markings stating the lanes.

I will add that it seems to me to be a weird design, I think that most people just assume that left lane is exit only hence with that cut across.

I spent 2 months feeling extremely stable, without fighting with my father and my boyfriend. Everything was great and wonderful. Until I started to feel extremely stressed. I started taking caffeine to help me deal with the sleepiness that Depakote was giving me and that made it impossible for me to do any healthy routine (opening windows, tidying my room. No, I wasn't having a depressive episode. I was just physically tired.) On the first day of the caffeine and stress, I started to feel incredibly happy. I took a shower and it felt like it was the first time in my life that I had come into contact with water. That made me incredibly happy (I was listening to music and dancing, and wow, it was the best feeling possible). But then the tremors started and the anger set in. Everything seemed so wrong. I controlled myself so I wouldn't break the bathroom window or bite myself or pull my hair out. I spent the whole day feeling everything I had felt in 1 year of my life: creativity. impulsive, I was shaking all over my body (jaw, head and hands) impulsive anger and a feeling of guilty sadness, I didn't sleep at all that day and completely isolated myself in the room, on the 2nd day I decided to drink coffee again because I woke up feeling good and wasn't feeling tired even with few hours of sleep, it was the worst mistake I ever made that left me a thousand times worse than yesterday, I spent the whole day pulling my hair out and having thoughts of leaving home (without taking clothes, food and anything of value) just me and the world with no destination, that same day I was treating my boyfriend very badly I barely spoke to him, anyway to sum it up on the 3rd day I went to the psychologist and she saw me in a horrible state I couldn't pay attention to anything, speak without shaking I was controlling myself so as not to punch the wall of her office and hurt my head, my leg itched a lot all the time and I pulled my hair out, she decided to prescribe me medicine to calm me down but I'm going to ask her to increase the dose of mine depakote to 1500mg, I'm afraid my life will be like this forever and I'll never have a moment of inner peace.",2,1733491679.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

When people look at things like miracles, or gods, or anything magical first thing they say is,‚Äù that‚Äôs fictional, doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

Go back in time to the year 1200 and describe to them a cell phone, they‚Äôll say that‚Äôs fictional as well, make believe. My own quote,‚Äù there is no such thing as fiction, just a science yet to be discovered and understood.‚Äù 

Three major points. Physical dimensions 

Neil loves this one yet doesn‚Äôt realize every time he talks about it, he is scientifically explaining gods existence. In a religious scripture, gods are beings that exist at all points of time and all points of space. Science fiction right? 

1st dimension: X

2nd dimension: XY

3rd dimension: XYZ. Neil loves talking about,‚Äù explain to a 2nd dimensional being about the Z axis, you can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs almost impossible to processes.‚Äù Also talks about

4th dimensional: Being able to travel your own time line. He draws a square around a 2nd dimensional being and tells him to just step out, can‚Äôt. Super simple to us, but the 2nd dimensional guy can‚Äôt see the Z axis to cross. A higher dimensional being would look at us in a box and tell us to escape, we say we can‚Äôt, 4th dimension travel to when you were out of the box in the past or future. 

5th dimension is going through another being‚Äôs timeline

6th dimension is making changes all with the time line

7th dimension is being able to do everything from 1-6. Sorta a blanket term for everything. 

8th dimension can travel anywhere within our own universe 

9th dimension is interesting as there‚Äôs evidence of this in religious scriptures, being able to travel to other dimensions. Astral projection, to project your soul energy to another dimension. Not the topic to focus on, rambling a bit but giving a lot of detail so you understand

10th dimension exists in all points of time and space at once, religiously the same definition as what a god is. Someone could say,‚Äù proof.‚Äù Proof is me explaining all the dimensions, proof is me giving you examples of what a professional has said. To ask for physical proof at our  year 1200 understanding of science is like telling the 2nd dimensional being to step out of the square. 

You have people who close their eyes, concentrate, and connect to the energy of the universe to astral project. Energy of the universe, a load of hog wash. There‚Äôs no such thing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Right? ‚ÄúNo such thing as fiction‚Äù

Part 2: Dark Energy

The force that expands our universe and makes up 68% of our universe in terms of mater ratio. In deep space, dark energy warps regular physics to the point big revolves around small and cold exists not just as an absence of heat. 

It‚Äôs extremely confusion yet dark energy is spread all through the universe from the moment of the Big Bang to now. Some people can feel this energy and before you say,‚Äù you can‚Äôt feel energy,‚Äù go outside and sit in the sunlight. Bask in the thermal energy of the sun. 

A force of nature that warps it like a cartoon, you could probably do some crazy shite with that kind of power like cause water molecules to compact when pressure is pushed on them (walking on water), or feeling the energy of the world and commanding its winds to slam into one specific part of the Red Sea to cause it to part (scientists discovered a wind current still exists to this day that barely and slightly pushes the sea apart yet briefly. Like some kind of aftermath). 

Our entire known universe is filled with this stuff, right? Wrong again. There is one spot void of this energy, not completely, but heavily. That one place is our known galaxy. As if it was used up somehow. People on our planet using the energy to make themselves gods without realizing it‚Äôs a non renewable resource. 

And yes I just described ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù using science. Everything is a hypothetical until proven wrong which is the point of this post, I want someone to have me remove the holes in my wall as if I go to Neil with this I want to hopefully start something. 

‚ÄúReligion has no place in science‚Äù

‚ÄúScience disproves religion‚Äù

This is my favorite point in history. When it was illegal to do science and illegal to be a witch. Yet people were still witches, feeling the energy that remain. They would combine animal parts and plants together, write the effects on the human body, and create mixtures to cure diseases. Very Wicca, not scientific till you replace witch doctor with Pharmacist. They do the same exact thing yet pharmacist has a piece of paper that says they‚Äôre special while witch doctors have experience. Alchemists to chemists is another one yet I won‚Äôt go into all the comparisons. Point is, religion and science goes together like cheese and wine. 

Last point: dimensions 

When most look at multiple dimensions they think of a 2 dimensional map. In contrast it‚Äôs like a planet where every atom that makes up the planet is another dimension. We‚Äôre a dust particle in the upper atmosphere of the dark matter reality where there‚Äôs more dark matter then physical matter. Near infinite amount of universes just like ours, dimensions, and when I say near it contradicts what Steven Hawking says about infinite. 

Gravity for this dimensional map represents concentration. Concentration of dark matter. Think of it like making a cake. You use a little vanilla flavoring, it‚Äôs light, it‚Äôs fine. Then your cousin when you aren‚Äôt looking uses Vanilla extract that is way more ‚Äúconcentrated‚Äù. 

The lower you get on the planet that‚Äôs the dimensional map, the more concentrated dark matter becomes where at a certain point, regular physics will be so different your existence is no longer possible as something else, possibly more potent, becomes the reality. 

When thinking of dimensional travel, I doubt any scientist is thinking of this. Dark matter concentration would be either lighter or more concentrated which is a calculation you have to plan for. Find the right concentration, making a door is so much easier. 

Going faster than light? We can‚Äôt do that because our concentration is so light. Dark matter acts like the bike helmet which protects us from most powerful forces. For example, you‚Äôre currently moving millions of miles an our through space as another force, gravity, is slamming down on you yet you‚Äôre slurping on your Starbucks coffee like nothing is happening. 

If you want to go faster than light, you need to increase the concentration of dark matter around you to cushion the force you‚Äôll create on yourself, or the vessel you make. ",0,1733491439.0,AskScienceDiscussion,12,0.07,False

The morning found all three of them sprawled asleep on Eastern's couch. They wound up just sleeping where they fell. Nothing other than sleep happened the night before - they were much too sore and tired for that but Nick was surprised how... comfortable it was to share space with the two of them. As he woke up, the soreness from the surgery surged back into prominence. Shouldn‚Äôt he be more upset about what Jameson did? He didn‚Äôt ask, he just knocked him and Eastern out and‚Ä¶ did surgery on them. Nick couldn‚Äôt even feel what was different. With a chill, he wondered if anything *was* different.¬†Why was he so unconcerned?

His motion on the bed woke up Sel and Eastern, and all three got up and made their way into Eastern's tiny kitchen as her coffee maker bubbled and hissed - she had one of those expensive automated coffee makers. Understandable for someone who needs caffeine to start the day, no thought necessary. Eastern bustled in the kitchen - Nick noticed her moving a little stiffly - and got tea going for Selkirk.

After the drinks were made, they all sat at the small table and woke up. ""Okay Sel,‚Äù Eastern took another sip of her coffee. ""We have to find an AI, her name is Yon."" She looked up at Selkirk. ""She's Jameson's daughter.""

Sel's ears pricked up while she was sipping her tea. ‚ÄúWhat? He has a daughter? How the hell does that work?""

Nick looked over at them. ""Takes all kinds to be a family Sel, you know that. He says Yon's his daughter, we're not going to quibble.""

""Fair enough."" Selkirk flicked her tail and took another a sip of tea. ""So everyone thought she was in the memory cube, but she wasn't? It‚Äôs not a coffin box - an emergency way to transport ‚Äúalive‚Äù AIs - so it would have been just a copy of her, right? Did Jameson let you keep cube?‚Äù

Eastern shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he kept it. I didn‚Äôt even think to ask for it back. Besides, what would I do with a memory cube for AIs? Even if I had something to store on it, I have no way to access it.‚Äù

Selkirk shrugged. ‚ÄúI guess. I was hoping we could use it to do some file forensics. Maybe she was loaded on it and moved off or decanted into a body. It would be something to start with. Oh well. ‚ÄúShe stood up and stretched, all her fur puffing out as she did. ""I don't know about you, I'm starving. Let's throw on some clothes and get breakfast first. I do all my best work on a full stomach."" The three of them got dressed - Nick once again marveled at how... comfortable it was to be together, the three of them, putting on clothes and getting ready - and went out into Hyacinth.

This time, Selkirk took the lead, and brought them to a cafe a short metro ride from Eastern's apartment. As they walked, Nick looked around. Eastern lived off Gladiolus square, up near the end of the arm. The further away from the base of Hyacinth you were, the less expensive the housing was, but also the less desirable it was - until you got to the very end. During rush hour, a metro ride from Gladiolus to Congregation took more than an hour. An Omnibus ride that far took maybe two. One of the biggest benefits of living that far up the arm was that the apartments were bigger. If you were willing to live all the way near the top of the arm, you could own a house with a *yard.* Born and raised a city kid, Nick always thought that was odd. Why pay extra to live super far away and have to do more maintenance on your own place? Nick's place off Laurel was just about the size of Eastern's bedroom and bathroom together, and his rent was still more than Eastern‚Äôs.¬†

Nick realized that they'd probably have to go apartment shopping soon if they were going to stay together long term. They might be able to save some money on one rent instead of three and be able to get a nicer place further down the arm.¬†

The cafe Selkirk lead them to was small, and had a decent mix of K'laxi and Humans inside. It smelled like breakfast. A host sat them by a window, and a server brought steaming pots of coffee and tea and left them on the table.¬†

""I've lived in Gladiolus for a year now and I never knew this place existed!"" Eastern looked around. ""Sel, you really do know everything there is to know about Hyacinth.""

""Everything that matters at least."" She flicked her ears playfully as she poured some tea. ""This place does pancakes and waffles with real Maple syrup. I don't know if it's Gord's Reserve, but we're close enough to Earth that we don't have to worry about it being fake.""

Nick glanced at the menu and quietly boggled while Selkirk talked. For what an order of pancakes cost, the maple syrup had better be platinum plated. ""I'm just going to get a breakfast sandwich."" Nick looked up at them. ""You two go nuts though."" Selkirk rolled her eyes. ""You can't go to a place that's famous for their *pancakes* and get the breakfast sandwich, Nick. This is my treat. Live a little. Get the pancakes. In fact..."" Selkirk made a complex gesture with her hands and ears and tail.

A K'laxi server noticed and came right over. Surprising Nick, Selkirk ordered for everyone in a patois of Colonic - the colonial language used in human space - and a K‚Äôlaxi dialect Nick didn‚Äôt recognize. It wound up being pancakes for the table, extra syrup, a fruit plate and some Near Bacon. Selkrik knew Nick was a Lacto-ovo vegetarian, so she kept meat off the order.¬†

A little while after that the food arrived. As the plates were placed down Eastern looked after them, her face deadly serious. ""No business until after we eat, okay? I will not talk shop on an empty stomach."" Nick and Selkirk nodded and they tucked in.¬† It really was a good meal. Nick wasn't usually the type to eat a big breakfast, he was more a coffee and pastry kind of person. Selkirk was clearly in her element though. She tore through the pancakes and syrup, making sure there was no leftovers. She made sure Eastern and Nick got what they wanted and they didn't feel deprived, but this was an... event for Selkirk.

""I never had you pegged as a foodie, Sel."" Eastern smiled and finished off her coffee.""

‚ÄúMaybe not other foods, but I fucking *love* pancakes."" Selkirk said after finishing a bite. ""I swear it's the best thing humans ever created. I could eat them every damn day.""

Nick smiled. ""Okay, now that we've eaten. We should talk next steps. Where do you want to talk?""

Selkirk looked around the cafe. It wasn't crowded but... ""Not here. Let's go to your place Nick, you live down-arm, I bet your place is nice.""

Nick was startled. His place was decidedly *not* nice. ""Uh okay, but just to manage expectations, it's a little messy.""

Eastern laughed. ""Nick, if it's anything like it was when I saw it last, the phrase 'a little messy' is doing some *heavy* lifting."" She slid her chair back and stood. ""Come on Sel, let's go see Nick's hovel. I'm sure you'll be horrified."" Selkirk flipped a chit onto the table and they left. They weren't in a hurry, so they took the omnibus down arm to Nick's place. He lived on the third floor of a 5 story apartment block, a couple minutes walk from the center of Laurel Square. On the bottom level of his building was a shop that sold kitschy antiques from Earth (all fake) and in the back had a small video game arcade of vintage games and consoles (all reproductions). Nick had gone in a few times, but never really understood the appeal. He could play games of every single type on his pad, even these. Why would people make the trek to this place to get sore feet playing the same games? But, the arcade was never rowdy and the shop closed up right after dinner, so Nick never really minded.

Selkirk looked at the building as they walked up. It was anonymous with few windows, and the shop on the ground level had no customers. ""Nick... Why do you live here? You're paying an arm and a leg for a place that looks like any other of the millions of anonymous apartments on Hyacinth. Yours is just closer to the base.""

Nick shrugged. ""I got it when I moved here.¬† Then, I didn't know any better. Now?"" Nick looked up at it. ""I dunno. inertia I guess?"" He thought a moment. ‚ÄúI do like being close to the base. I never liked long Metro rides.‚Äù

Selkirk shot a look at Eastern who shrugged her shoulders.¬†

""Nick, if this place is half as bad as Eastern makes it out to be, we're going to have to accelerate getting a place together. You can't live here.""

He looked at Selkirk, surprised. What? Why? At least look at the inside first."" Nick was already feeling defensive about his apartment and they haven't even gone inside it yet.

They went into the building, and they¬† could have been in any of thousands of apartment buildings on Hyacinth. It felt completely anonymous. As they went up the stairs and Eastern joked with Selkirk about how Nick lived in a 'Default Apartment‚Äô. Nick unlocked the door and they stepped in.

""Oh Ancestors, Nick!"" Selkirk coughed ""This is *a little* messy\*??""\*

Nick stood in the doorway, mouth open. His apartment was *trashed*. All the drawers open and tipped out, desk overturned, everything strewn about.¬†

Eastern peered around Nick's shoulder and laughed. ""Nick! What did you do? This isn't normal is it? Why is your place trashed?""

Nick whirled to Selkirk and Eastern. ""No! Something happened! This isn't how my place usually is! Someone must've come in and... trashed it.""

Selkirk turned back to look at Nick. ""But *why*?""

""I have no idea. The last job I did was boosting the cube from Houndstooth and... I got... away clean..."" He whirled. ‚ÄúOh fuck. They must be looking for the cube.‚Äù Nick gathered Eastern and Selkirk. ""The *only* job i've done in at least two weeks is boost that stupid cube.¬† Whoever trashed my place must be looking for it. I think there's more to this than what Jameson is letting on.""¬†

Selkirk rolled her eyes. ""Nick, it's fucking *Jameson Winters*. He runs **all** of Hyacinth that isn't owned by Houndstooth, and I imagine some that is. If you thought things were on the straight and level, that's on you hon."" She put her arms on her hips, mimicking a human gesture. ""It is a good damn thing you're attractive, Nick.""

Eastern looked around. ""Well, we certainly can't stay here. Nick, grab some clothes, leave everything else. You're moving out.""

Nick reached down and picked up a shirt. ""But what about-""

Eastern shook her head. ""No Nick. We don't know if they bugged anything.¬† Everything here is suspect. I hope none of it was a memento or an antique, because it ain't coming with us.""

Sighing, Nick went through the apartment. He really didn't have much to begin with. He kept his pad on him so he didn't have to worry about that, and it's not like he kept stores of currency or valuables here. He stood in his bedroom and looked at a photo on the wall. It was two adults standing stiffly proud, with a small boy, maybe 10 holding a trophy. I can‚Äôt leave that, he thought, it‚Äôs my only photo of my parents.

Eastern yelped. Selkirk whirled around. ""What is it Eastern?""

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ heard Nick! He said that the photo on the wall was the only photo he had of his parents.‚Äù She leaned into the bedroom. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you were‚Ä¶ thinking right?‚Äù

Nick turns slowly towards Eastern, his eyes wide. ‚ÄúI was thinking that.‚Äù He held the photo and showed it to her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only thing I kept‚Ä¶ after.‚Äù

Eastern shivered. ‚ÄúIs this what Jameson did to us? Connected us somehow? Why? Why would he do that? How will it help?‚Äù

Nick reached behind his head and touched the bandage at the base of his neck. He could feel‚Ä¶ something hard there. He felt the world start to shift under his feet and felt like the walls were moving. Not now. Can‚Äôt worry about this now.¬†

Eastern nodded. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right Nick, we‚Äôll deal with it later. When we‚Äôre safe.‚Äù

Sel‚Äôs barked a single laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bold goal, Eastern. Saying that a time will come when we are safe.‚Äù She looked around the trashed room. ‚ÄúI like your optimism.‚Äù

Eastern took the photo out of Nick‚Äôs hands, sighed, and looked at Nick. ""Sorry."" Then she threw it on the ground as hard as she could, and it came apart with a tinkle of smashed glass.""

""Eastern? What the fuck?"" Nick was aghast.

Selkirk reached down and picked up the shattered remains of the photo. She flipped over the frame and without saying anything, showed it to Nick. On the back, under the cardboard, in between the photo and the backing was a wafer thin piece of plastic with lines and miniature components embedded on it. It was no larger than 3cm square.

Eastern gently took it from Selkirk and showed it to Nick. ""They *know* you Nick. They know you're sentimental. Use your Pad to take a picture of the photo. Do it to any other ones you'd want to keep, but the originals have to stay. Like I said, this whole place is compromised. In fact-"" Eastern looked at the clothes in his hand. ""-put those down, we're going to buy new.‚Äù She looked around. ""Everything here is burned. We can't take it, we shouldn't even touch it.""

Nick looked at the clothes in his hand. It was just a shirt and a pair of pants. He couldn‚Äôt even remember where he bought them. He tossed the clothes back on the floor and took out his pad. He went around the apartment and took a few quick pictures of his photos and mementos. After no time at all he was back in the kitchen. ""Okay, I'm done."" He turned back to the apartment and looked one more time. ""Let's go,‚Äù Without another glance, they were out. When they came back outside Nick looked at Eastern and Selkirk ""So, uh, what do I do about the trashed apartment?‚Äù

Selkirk waved a hand dismissively. ""We'll call a cleanout service. They're around for when people die or fuck off without getting rid of their stuff. Were you on a lease or month to month?""

""Lease ran out 6 months ago, I was month to month.""

Eastern nods. ""Good. We just won't pay next month and you'll be free and clear.""

Nick looked between the women. That‚Äôs all it took? One call, one missed payment and he was gone. All too easy to erase any signs of his life. ""But, how are we going to pay for it?""

Selkirk grinned. ""Our lovely, scary, benefactor is going to pay for it. Jameson gave us a modest expense account. All the better, since his people probably know cleaners who are... discrete, though not cheap.‚Äù

Eastern looked out towards nothing as they walked. ""And if Jameson was the one that did it?""

Selkirk flicked her tail and shrugged at the same time. ""Then he'll know why we're hiring the cleaners. They didn't get what they were after - I assume - so we should lay low and keep a look out."" She sighed. ""Our places are probably next - if they haven't been hit already. Come on, I want to go to my place and pack up some stuff before it gets trashed."" The three of them continued on into the morning towards the Metro station. Figuring time was of the essence, they took the Metro to Selkirk's place. She lived in a K'laxi neighborhood just outside of Tulip square on the top floor of a 10 story apartment building. When they go to her door, Selkirk motioned for silence and her ears flicked. After a moment she slowly put her hand on the pad next to the door. With a chirrup and a heavy clunk, the door unlocked.

Her apartment was neat and tidy and seemingly untouched. Being careful, they walked around looking, not touching anything. After making sure nobody was inside with them Selkirk looked at Nick and Eastern. ‚ÄúNick, check the access logs for my place please.‚Äù

Nick looked around the apartment, then back at the door.‚Äù I-I‚Ä¶ what do you-‚Äú

Selkirk sighed and pointed to the pad he was holding. ‚ÄúI know you can do it. You hack and steal shit all the time. I just want to see the entry logs.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! Oh! Okay Sel, I thought you meant‚Ä¶‚Äù He pointed at his head.

‚ÄúMaybe later, if you learn how to access the fancy shit Jameson put in your head. For now? Do it the way you know how.‚Äù

Nick opened his pad, and accessed his secret directory. He kept a few lock picking apps and softs and connected to the building network, spoofing a Houndstooth maintenance app. From there, he was able to jump over to an unused (he hoped) admin account, change the password, and then log in. It took him 3 minutes to gain his access. It took nearly as long just to find where the system kept the damn logs. ""Looks like your bedroom window recorded an open and a close around 20:00 last night, Sel. It wasn't marked as unauthorized though.

Selkirk's tair flicked irritatedly. ""Looks like the goons that searched my place were less rowdy than the ones that ransacked yours, Nick. Still, I think I have to assume my place is out of commission too. Come on.""¬†

Selkirk turned on her heel and walked out the door. Shrugging Eastern and Nick followed her. She didn‚Äôt have any photos or other personal items other than clothes and pots and pans. Nick wondered about that as they walked out.",6,1733491343.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Not my first time DMing, but it‚Äôs the first time in a while, and the first time with Shadowdark (for adults)! I designed a Gauntlet for my homebrew world, and I made sure to experiment with my terrain and mark down the general ideas for each room. 

The boss room will be set up separately, and there are two ways to get there from the main dungeon. Helps to save on how much terrain I need to have with me. We‚Äôre meeting at a game-friendly beer garden, and everything fits easily in a backpack!

I printed QuickStart guides on quality paper for each player, did a very simple booklet bind, and even trimmed the edges for a more professional look. I think everyone will love those. I also have a giant stack of pre-generated level 0s and large character sheets (which I will ‚Äúage‚Äù with coffee today) that the players will get to enjoy once they complete the Gauntlet. 

There are also the Shadowspark treasure cards which I printed and put in sleeves. I might laminate them and use my corner rounder for an ultra pro look if I have time. And of course there‚Äôs my box of dice, and a special dice holder/roller for me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll toss in some additional items if I think of them (foldable dice tray since it‚Äôs a beer garden), but what would YOU include in this kit to really make this first session memorable for the players? 

I‚Äôll admit, I think the Gauntlet will be awesome since it‚Äôs the only time I will be allowed to railroad in a way that makes sense, but I could way more resources to help sandbox-i-fy the world slightly beyond the book‚Äôs random tables.

1h812uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Official/comments/1h812uz/full_14_special_program_summary/,Full 1.4 Special Program summary.,"-Story trailer. Small combat showcase for Miyabi and Harumasa. Continuation of the main story, involving all factions so far.

-Two narrative leads on the program today.

-Chapter 5 brings everything together: the past of the protags at Helios Academy, pubsec election, Perlman.

-Patch will be Miyabi-centric. Legendary cursed katana with story secrets.

-No spoilers, but chapter is somber in tone.

-**New maps: Port Elpis and Reverb Arena**.

**-Chapter 5 acts as a climax of the first story cycle of ZZZ**.

-**Gameplay Mode Selector for a lot of TV Main Story** comissions. Instead of replacing them with Combat ones and removing the Proxy side as in the Calydon patch, there's a **new gameplay mode that goes through the TV beats moving around specific 3D stages with Eous**: platforming, moving switches, that kind of stuff.

-It **does not replace the TV**, players can pick whether to play TV perspective or Eous perspective.

-Story map for the entire journey can be viewed from the bed.

-**Harumasa Agent Story**. Prodigy slacker with a lot of backstory.

-**Miyabi, Frost Anomaly. Frost is an attribute unique to Miyabi** that creates corruption (like Ether) and also freezes, the anomaly is Frost Corruption.

-**Combat showcase.** Her attacks apply a debuff that when fully stacked procs her anomaly and leaves the enemy more vulnerable to other Anomaly Buildups. Both that debuff and her EX special give her stacks that can be consumed holding Basic Attack to superslash. Passive is up with Supports or SEC6, basically buffs her Hold superslash (charges stacks on ally disorder, more attack, ignore IceRes%).

-**Harumasa, Electric Attack.**

-**Combat Showcase. Bowman that morphs the bow to blade** depending on the attack. **His kit sets electric traps** in mid-air, hold basic attack to command them all to attack enemies and enter melee mode with an enhanced dash attack. Hold Normal has target selection to make the traps attack the guy you want to kill specifically.

**-New Bangboos: Agent Gulliver (s) for SEC6, and Brawlerboo (A).** Gulliver charges through a door and Brawler flies around and divebombs.

-Shift to designer leads to talk about new gameplay.

-**Into That Pale Wasteland. New hollow with puzzles and navigation included in the combat stages.** Camera angle puzzle, a bangboo curcuit one, and the new Eous platforming gameplay. Combat with Trial versions of Yanagi and Miyabi. Gives a new W-engine and general resources.

-Immediate access to the event as long as an account cleared Chapter 2.

-**New Hollow Zero event: Shadows lost. Almost pure combat** interspersed with fast store upgrade rests. Character boosting function: if you have an agent, you can use a ""bring them up to par"" auto-built version of them in the mode, regardless of their level or gear. Some agents have unique upgrade moves with new animations in the mode: miyabi, yanagi, ellen, billy. More to come in future patches to this gamemode. Prizes are brawlerboo, resources, and tickets to get discs without spending energy.

-**New Hollow Zero mode: Deadly Assault. New endgame seasonal**, with three juiced up bosses that you can't reuse units between. Scoring is twofold: total damage dealt (the mode gives prizes even if you don't kill) and a technical bonus for parries, dodges, anomaly, that sort of stuff. Its inclusion also shifts the Shiyu timer around in the calendar.

-**Tower defense event for Bangboos.**

-Where the Stars Shine Bright. Auto training event like the HIA one.

-Tile puzzle event.

-HIA small commission with bingo card. Double drop periods for HIA and discs. New bosses. New Mewmew city challenges and coins for the areas. New collectibles for the display, new generic avatar icons. More ingame build recommendations and guides. Less clicks.

-**New disc sets**: one grives crit damage to anomaly characters that trigger freeze, the other gives atk% and damage after entering from a quick assist.

-**Free Harumasa to all accounts.**

-**Redeption Code: VOIDHUNTER**

-**Both banners will run simultaneously with the version update.**

-General lowering of unlock requirements and tresholds of progression. Showcase of the story guide. All double drop rate coffees are unified into one. Bonus drops will now be listed alongside normal ones instead of in a separate stack.

-**Ultimate split: each agent will get their own decibels**. Characters still get decibels from the other's actions.

-**Shiyu can now be started from stage 4** if the player S-ranked the previous cycle.

-**New bond hangouts** with agents at Trust 2 or higher. Each gives polychromes and some gifts. They'll stop at stores they want to visit and you can play the arcades with them. Miyabi, Soukaku, and Harumasa will get these events instead of the old invites.

-**All character free roaming. Yes, including Ben. They showcased Ben in particular, because they know.**

-The arcade vampire survivors gets a ""Save and continue"" feature.

-**Mobile versions get a select data package deletion** to free space from old story and cutscenes. PC will get it too, but not this patch. General tweaks to texturing and animation.

-Web event with levelup mats.

-Western merch store and sountrack release in the works.

**-Update on December 18.**

And that's that. Cya all.",12,1733490869.0,ZZZ_Official,1,1.0,False

Whether it's partying out, chatting over coffee, or deep talks on the phone, I'm down for anything (SFW of course)!

First off, here's some stuff about me!

* I'm a currently student who just moved back to the PH a few months ago! I studied abroad for a few years prior to moving back. Actually I'm still adjusting to the city since it really feels sad and scary (which is why I'm looking for friends to feel less lonely) but at the same time it feels really exciting! Feel free to ask me more about my experiences abroad (I might actually have a lot of stories, which leads me to my next point)!
* Many people say that I radiate positive energy and that I'm basically the golden retriever kind of friend who is game for anything! If you're looking for a wholesome kind of friend who could motivate you, I'm that guy! I also like to talk a lot (which is why you're reading a very long message) especially if we vibe! But I do love to listen as well, so feel free to rant or vent whenever you need to! A downside though is I'm very persistent and¬†*madaldal*¬†to the point that I may be clingy. I would like constants/friends who would be able to match my energy, so please be ready for my constant barrage of messages!
* I have a lot of hobbies and interests, but you don't necessarily have to match all of them! I mainly dance, listen to K-Pop, and dance to K-Pop. I also play the piano though I don't really have much time for that anymore. Aside from that, I love to travel too (probably because I am an aviation geek!) Aside from K-Pop, I'm also trying to explore musicals (there was a point in time when I was obsessed with musical scores). I can probably share music (especially K-Pop) and travel recommendations if we become friends! I am also into graphics design whenever I get the chance (note: if I am not coerced to do so!) Don't worry if you don't like any of the hobbies that I listed since we can always find stuff to talk about. I am also hoping if we can share our hobbies and do the things that we like together!

I'm sorry if that intro is a bit too long for you (I find it relatively short since there's a lot of stuff that I wanted to put, but we can get to know each other as we talk anyways), but here's a short profile of me:

üë®üèª‚ÄçüéìMBTI: INFJ-T

‚ôèÔ∏è Zodiac Sign: Scorpio

üì∫ Favorite Shows/Dramas: Reply 1997 (unpopular opinion: I actually prefer this over Reply 1988, ask me why), Gilmore Girls, Modern Family, The Good Wife

üéµ Favorite Songs / Albums / Music in my head right now: Saint-Sa√´ns' Danse Macabre, anything GFriend (particularly the school trilogy), StayC's Bubble, and currently listening to TWICE's Strategy (Kiss My Troubles Away is a bop!)

üíÉ Hobbies: K-Pop, Dancing, Traveling

üßòüèª Stuff I want to Do: Dancing, Fitness (might want to try pilates/gym/mma), Going out to cafes and restaurants, Strolling Around, Baking/Painting, Rage Rooms, literally anything (again, so long as it's SFW)

üç≥ Comfort Food: McDo's Fillet-o-Fish (why is this gone in the PH :<)

ü•ò Food that I'm thinking about right now: Laksa and Satay (especially onboard Singapore Airlines, makes me want to travel again rn)

üèôÔ∏è Favorite Cities: Seoul and New York

In a nutshell, I'm looking for friends whom I can hang out me! I would also like friends who could reciprocate my energy, so if you're interested please do send me an intro (it doesn't have to be super lengthy, I just want to know a bit more about you)! That's all and I hope to be able to chat/meet you :>",2,1733490869.0,PhR4Friends,1,1.0,False

1h811m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkFun/comments/1h811m4/where_to_meet_bisexuals_in_houston_tx/,"Where to Meet Bisexuals in Houston, TX","Houston is a huge, vibrant city where you can connect with many bisexuals.

1h811bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/1h811bm/spoilers_all_seasons_s1e10_realization_philip/,"[Spoilers all seasons] S1E10 realization: Philip Price's conversation with Angela about James Plouffe, and his own ""obsessive denial of reality""","Through several rewatches of the show, I've been under the impression that Price's reaction to Plouffe's death being so cold and heartless was included simply to demonstrate his magnanimously evil character, especially given how it ended with Price addressing Ecorp in a way that visually depicts the setup of the event and attendees with a fascist-adjacent aesthetic. He tells Angela that he was a coward, he believes that ""even his family"" will benefit from his death.

> Between you and me, I was glad he killed himself. ...He was not a very good person. He had a gambling problem. He drank too much. Most notably, he was weak. His instincts left a lot to be desired. Oh, I despise people like that. In fact, I felt... the world was a little better off knowing he wasn't in it anymore. ...Oh, I believe even his family will benefit from this in the long run.

But what has always struck me is how *inhuman* this response seems, and how out-of-character for someone trying to impress and develop a closer relationship with his daughter. Was this supposed to make Angela view him as more powerful? If anything, it does the opposite. Was he trying to break her of her kind spirit? No, we see that he appreciates that about her in the flashback at Allsafe in S3E09, when she gets Terry Colby coffee despite not being the secretary he seemed to think she was.

I don't know why I didn't realize until now, but *his response comes off as weird because it IS weak!* He is not giving his context-free opinions about this: he is trying to relieve his feeling of guilt, because he knows that *he is responsible for Plouffe's death!* We learn in S3E09 during the confrontation between Elliot and Tyrell that Price walks in on, that Price was complicit in 5/9 from the beginning:

> Mr. Robot: Five/Nine, fsociety. You knew the entire time, didn't you?
> 
> Price: Five/Nine, yes. Well, not all the minutiae, of course. But since the cyber bombings, the breadcrumbs haven't been that difficult to follow. World catastrophes like this, they aren't caused by lone wolves like you. They occur because men like me *allow* them.

Now, we know that he did this in order to kickstart Ecoin and set in motion the conditions for it to usurp the US Dollar as de facto world reserve currency. But I always thought he was 100% committed to that goal until today. Now I realize that Price knew, when he was telling Angela he was glad for Plouffe's death, that *he allowed Plouffe to take the fall for a breach Price deliberately allowed to happen*. He had to have known that with that level of ruin, suicide is a possible choice that Plouffe could've taken - and if he hadn't, his life would have been effectively ruined anyway.

In a sense that Price himself seems to understand, **Philip Price killed James Plouffe**. And he has to justify this to himself and to Angela by demonizing Plouffe, and by suggesting that he's actually done a *good* thing because maybe Plouffe's family will even benefit from his death. This is not the way that someone speaks if they don't care about a person who just died. **This is how a person speaks if they're trying to convince themselves and others that something they know they did wrong was actually not that bad.**

---

Furthermore, his malogy of Plouffe could very well be applied to *himself* by the end of the series, making this an awesomely believable bit of projection as well.

> He had a gambling problem.

Price sacrificed good business sense to go all-in against Whiterose (threatening to sabotage the Congo deal and calling himself a mercenary who wants to see her lose more than win himself), who it turns out was not bluffing, and lost everything (Angela) as a result.

> He drank too much.

His final scene before going outside with Whiterose shows him drinking quite freely:

> Price: ""We've never gotten drunk together, have we? I think this might be a good night to start. What do you think?""

> Most notably, he was weak.

He could not protect his daughter or meaningfully stand up to Whiterose despite being the CEO of the world's largest megacorporation.

> His instincts left a lot to be desired.

His daughter got killed because he let his ego get the better of him when dealing with a violent mobster, and he got into business with Whiterose *in the first place*.

> In fact, I felt... the world was a little better off knowing he wasn't in it anymore.

The next episode after Price's death, the news snippets in the background don't even mention it. There is a general sense of relief and discovery, and Darlene and Dom go to the park and distribute the robbery winnings to *everyone*. Whiterose shot Philip Price and everyone got a Christmas miracle bonus.

> ...Oh, I believe even his family will benefit from this in the long run.

Unfortunately, there is no long run for his family anymore. But if he had swapped shoes with James Plouffe in season 1, Angela would very likely still be alive.

Philip Price hated himself and knew that he contributed to the deaths of countless people. He felt insecure confronted with Angela's humanity for Plouffe following his death, knowing that as much as Angela has Plouffe's blood on her shoes, Price had his blood on his hands.",4,1733490731.0,MrRobot,0,1.0,False

While SEAF Science Division's Weapon R&D department prepares more Democratically Accurate Weapon Overview materials, just for a few minutes, lets shift our attention to one of the only things that isn't ""actively"" trying kill our heroic Helldivers on the battlefield. ""Passively"" excluded for a reason.

Today we are gonna talk about the only girl within our Democratic space heaven so popular, that Helldivers are are able to drool waterfalls without ever having seen her.



*Eagle 1* is your pilot. Buckle up, grab your gear, and say goodbye to any plans you had for a quiet mission. She's not just a support member; She's a one-person *action movie*, complete with explosions, heroic one-liners, and a trail of smoldering wreckage. Helldivers wouldn‚Äôt be the same without her ‚Äì mostly because no one else is insane enough to fill her boots.

**Name**: *Eagle 1*  
**Role**: Air Support Specialist  


# Overview:

When your squad needs salvation from hordes of bugs, cyborgs, or laser-toting Illuminates, look no further than *Eagle 1*. With the precision of a drunken dart player and the heart of a caffeinated medic, *Eagle 1* dominates the battlefield from the cockpit. This ace pilot isn‚Äôt just your insurance when it comes to returning alive ‚Äì they‚Äôre your **guardian angel**, provided your guardian angel enjoys smoldered earth, questionable evasive maneuvers, and *friendly fire* (it‚Äôs ""supportive fire"" ‚Äì there‚Äôs a difference).

# Features:

1. **Deafening efficiency:** Forget ""five stars,"" *Eagle 1* guarantees **fifty explosions** and death, without discriminations, be it friend or foe! Need a covering fire? Call in *Eagle 1*! Sure, the zone might be on fire, and half your squad could be in critical condition from debris, but you're *kind of, sort of, maybe, not exactly ALIVE*, aren't you?
2. **Precision Bombardment:** Armed with an arsenal of *‚Äôoops, my bad‚Äô* ordnance, *Eagle 1* delivers payloads with laser-guided accuracy ‚Äì by which we mean lasers guide them *into your general area*. Fear not; they‚Äôll eventually hit the enemy. Probably. That actually depends a lot more on your stratagem hurling accuracy.
3. **Tactical Drops:** Need fire? booms? Coffee? No problem! *Eagle 1* drops it all with impeccable timing and‚Ä¶ questionable aim. A 500KG Bomb to the face builds character ‚Äì or so they claim.

# 

# Verdict:

When *Eagle 1* is your pilot, there are only two things you can count on: **death-defying heroics** and **death-redefining screwups**.

One area where each of us can make a difference is in how we garden. Sustainable gardening practices are designed to promote long-term environmental health, reduce waste, and enhance biodiversity. By adopting these practices, gardeners can contribute to a greener future, while also cultivating thriving, low-maintenance gardens.

In this blog, we‚Äôll explore sustainable gardening practices that not only benefit your garden but also the planet. From soil health and water conservation to plant selection and composting, sustainable gardening is a holistic approach that works in harmony with nature. Let‚Äôs dive into how these methods can help you grow a more eco-friendly garden while enhancing biodiversity and reducing your environmental footprint.

https://preview.redd.it/cdtqqbcj485e1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bac77c54c5a23a47eda4b71154bc3a7d6ffd84f3

**What is Sustainable Gardening?**

Sustainable gardening refers to practices that are environmentally friendly and work in harmony with the natural ecosystem. The goal is to create a garden that is not only beautiful and functional but also supports biodiversity, conserves resources, and minimizes the need for chemical inputs. It focuses on reducing water usage, improving soil health, and minimizing environmental impacts such as pollution and habitat destruction.

By adopting sustainable gardening practices, gardeners can improve the overall health of their landscape while conserving natural resources. Sustainable gardening promotes biodiversity, ensures the conservation of water, and reduces reliance on harmful pesticides and fertilizers. Ultimately, sustainable gardening helps to mitigate climate change by reducing the carbon footprint associated with traditional gardening methods.

**1. Water Conservation in Gardening**

Water is one of the most precious resources we have, and it is essential to use it wisely, especially in areas that are prone to drought. In sustainable gardening, water conservation is a priority. Overwatering is not only wasteful, but it can also harm plants and promote the growth of weeds. Here are some ways to reduce water usage in your garden:

**Drip Irrigation and Soaker Hoses**

Drip irrigation systems and soaker hoses deliver water directly to the base of plants, minimizing evaporation and water runoff. These systems can significantly reduce water waste by ensuring that only the roots of plants receive moisture.

* **Statistical Impact:** According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), drip irrigation can save up to 50% more water than traditional sprinkler systems, making it a highly efficient option for gardens.

**Rain Barrels**

Collecting rainwater through rain barrels is an excellent way to reduce dependence on municipal water systems. By capturing rainwater from rooftops, you can store water for later use, especially during dry periods.

* **Benefits:** Rainwater is free of the chemicals typically found in tap water, such as chlorine and fluoride, making it a better option for plants. Additionally, using rainwater reduces the strain on local water supplies, particularly in urban areas.

**Mulching**

Mulching helps to retain moisture in the soil by reducing evaporation. Organic mulches like wood chips, straw, or leaves also improve soil fertility as they break down, adding nutrients and organic matter.

* **Statistical Impact:** Studies have shown that mulching can reduce water usage by up to 40%, especially in hot, dry climates.

**Native Plants and Drought-Tolerant Species**

Choosing native plants or drought-tolerant species is one of the best ways to ensure that your garden requires less water. Native plants are adapted to local weather conditions and require less maintenance. Many drought-tolerant plants, such as succulents and cacti, can thrive with minimal water.

* **Statistical Impact:** Native plants typically need 30-50% less water than non-native species, making them an essential part of water-efficient gardening.

**2. Soil Health and Composting**

Healthy soil is the foundation of a sustainable garden. It plays a crucial role in plant growth by providing nutrients, structure, and drainage. The key to maintaining healthy soil is focusing on soil biology and minimizing the use of chemical fertilizers. Here‚Äôs how you can improve your soil health sustainably:

**Composting**

Composting is one of the most effective ways to reduce waste and enhance soil fertility. By composting organic waste such as vegetable scraps, yard trimmings, and coffee grounds, you can create nutrient-rich compost to feed your plants. This reduces the need for synthetic fertilizers and diverts organic waste from landfills.

* **Statistical Impact:** The EPA estimates that 30% of the waste sent to landfills in the U.S. is organic, much of which could be composted to reduce landfill waste and create valuable soil amendments.

**No-Till Gardening**

Tilling the soil disrupts soil structure, harms beneficial microorganisms, and leads to erosion. No-till [gardening](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden), which involves planting directly into the undisturbed soil, helps preserve the soil ecosystem and reduces the need for artificial inputs. By maintaining soil structure, you improve its ability to retain water, enhance its fertility, and promote plant health.

* **Benefits:** No-till practices can increase organic matter in the soil, improve soil aeration, and reduce the risk of erosion. It also enhances soil‚Äôs carbon sequestration potential, helping combat climate change.

**Using Organic Fertilizers**

Instead of relying on chemical fertilizers that can harm the environment and degrade soil health, opt for organic alternatives. Organic fertilizers, such as compost, manure, and seaweed-based products, improve soil structure, enhance biodiversity, and provide long-term benefits without damaging the environment.

* **Statistical Impact:** According to the Organic Trade Association, organic farming practices can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 25%, making organic fertilizers an essential part of sustainable gardening.

**3. Reducing Pesticide and Herbicide Use**

Traditional gardening often relies on synthetic pesticides and herbicides to control pests and weeds. However, these chemicals can have harmful effects on the environment, harming pollinators, soil health, and local wildlife. Sustainable gardening focuses on minimizing or eliminating the use of chemical treatments by using natural alternatives.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM)**

IPM is an eco-friendly approach that combines different strategies to control pests without harming the environment. This includes using natural predators (like ladybugs to control aphids), introducing beneficial insects, and selecting resistant plant varieties.

* **Statistical Impact:** According to the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), IPM has been shown to reduce pesticide use by 60-90% on average, helping to protect ecosystems and wildlife.

**Natural Herbicides and Pest Control**

Instead of relying on synthetic chemicals, there are several natural alternatives to control pests and weeds. These include neem oil, diatomaceous earth, and garlic sprays. Beneficial insects, like ladybugs, lacewings, and predatory beetles, can be introduced to control pests in an environmentally friendly manner.

* **Benefits:** By using natural pest control methods, gardeners can reduce the environmental damage caused by toxic chemicals and protect pollinators, which are vital for plant reproduction.

**4. Promoting Biodiversity in Your Garden**

Biodiversity refers to the variety of plant and animal life in a given ecosystem. A diverse garden ecosystem is more resilient and better able to withstand pests, diseases, and climate extremes. In sustainable gardening, promoting biodiversity is a central goal, as it helps maintain the health and balance of the entire ecosystem.

**Plant a Variety of Species**

Diverse plantings create a healthy ecosystem by providing food and shelter for various beneficial insects and wildlife. Choose a range of plants, including flowers, shrubs, trees, and herbs, to support biodiversity in your garden.

* **Statistical Impact:** According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), biodiversity is directly linked to ecosystem resilience. A diverse garden can support a wider range of species, helping to stabilize the ecosystem.

**Encourage Pollinators**

Pollinators such as bees, butterflies, and birds play a critical role in plant reproduction. By planting nectar-rich flowers and providing shelter (such as birdhouses or bee hotels), you can support local pollinator populations and enhance biodiversity.

* **Statistical Impact:** The decline of pollinators is a serious concern. The Pollinator Partnership estimates that pollinators are responsible for one-third of the food we consume, making their conservation essential for sustainable food systems.

**5. Climate Change Mitigation**

Climate change poses a significant threat to the environment, and sustainable gardening can play a crucial role in mitigating its effects. Practices such as reducing fossil fuel use, increasing carbon sequestration, and conserving water can help reduce a garden‚Äôs carbon footprint.

**Carbon Sequestration Through Soil**

Plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and store it in their tissues. By adopting sustainable gardening practices such as no-till gardening, mulching, and growing perennial plants, you can increase carbon storage in your soil and reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.

* **Statistical Impact:** The USDA‚Äôs Natural Resources Conservation Service estimates that soil carbon sequestration in agricultural lands could offset as much as 3.7 billion metric tons of CO2 annually.

**Conclusion**

Sustainable gardening is an essential practice for creating a greener future. By adopting water conservation techniques, improving soil health, reducing pesticide use, promoting biodiversity, and mitigating climate change, we can cultivate gardens that support both the environment and future generations. Sustainable gardening is not just a trend; it‚Äôs a movement toward a more eco-friendly and resilient world. You can also buy some gardening tools and products from [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) and TrueGether.

Each of us can contribute to a greener planet through our gardening choices. Whether you are growing a small backyard garden or maintaining a larger landscape, every sustainable decision you make adds up to create a positive environmental impact. Let‚Äôs work together to nurture nature and build a sustainable future for generations to come.

so we met 7ish months ago as we live in the same apartment building and moved this year to a different one but have our own rooms. i feel very unloved from her, im very adventurous i love going on walks, walking around the city and grabbing coffees etc. she likes to sit in her room and play her video games and get high etc. i know i cant change her and have her come on hikes with me etc but i‚Äôve asked her to try and meet me half way. i‚Äôve sobbed to her so many times about it within the last week and a month ago and she said she‚Äôll try harder as i told her i feel so lonely doing so much on my own because she can‚Äôt be bothered to go out or that she‚Äôll get overstimulated. ive tried to meet her halfway and say we can go at night when it‚Äôs less busy etc. we have had two arguments this week because i told her i want her to show she cares me, example: she sleeps until 4-8pm most days and i told her that i get she needs her sleep but sleeping for 13+ hours a day isn‚Äôt normal and she should get it checked out and she gets mad and says it is normal. i also mentioned how lonely i feel that i live a full day and i only hear from her with a goodmorning text when it‚Äôs literally 6pm like?? we saw eachother last night for the first time properly in a week. we were going to do uni work and watch shameless. when we were snuggling before uni work she was initiating sex and i said i needed to do work and im really tired and not in the mood (she always wants to fuck) and  i felt the need to say sorry. she was like it‚Äôs fine and that she‚Äôs not a man. we did uni work and i asked her if she wanted to stay over and she said yes which i got excited about because we haven‚Äôt slept together in 2 weeks and with all the arguments it would‚Äôve been nice to snuggle and feel a bit of love from her. then we were watching our tv show bare in mind both having uni in 5 hours so when she initiated sex again i said ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got a presentation in 5 hours and i‚Äôve got to do my assignment we need to sleep‚Äù. then she suddenly switches up and says ‚Äúim going to sleep at mine tonight‚Äù. which really hurt me because she will agree to something and then change her mind and i feel let down. she asked me if i was mad and i told her i wasn‚Äôt mad im just feeling let down and she was saying how she feels conflicted and i said im not forcing you to stay go down if you‚Äôd like i was just looking forward to snuggling you. anyways it‚Äôs 3 hours after her presentation and she‚Äôs slept through it, she sleeps through class quite often and i told her last night if she stayed up here i would make sure she was awake and would make her breakfast but she snaps back and says she‚Äôll be awake. lol. anyways. i just feel very unnapreatited by her and feel almost like a comfort blanket or some sex doll when she needs me. i feel very unheard when i asked twice this week and in the past to feel more loved and she tells me she loves me and talks to me more than anyone else, but i really just don‚Äôt feel it. it‚Äôs not even that i want her to come out with me because ive come to terms with it but even little gestures like helping me clean or making me coffees, getting me flowers. ive asked her so many times how much i love flowers and she‚Äôll say she‚Äôll get me more and never does even after both these arguments which were both how unhappy i am. i get her flowers every week and paint her pictures i just want to receive little gestures like that back that would mean sm to me. ive been so stressed out because i care about her so much and have sm love to give and i know there‚Äôs not many people out there who could give the same amount that i give but i truly feel so unhappy. i don‚Äôt want to lose her but i know this isn‚Äôt going to work out in the long term. it just hurts that she won‚Äôt seem to realise she‚Äôs hurt me at all until i bring it up. i really want this to work, it‚Äôs my first official relationship and i really just dokt know how to go about this. i know i deserve better though.

While fasting may seem daunting, many people report significant health improvements after just three days of consuming only water. Understanding these benefits can provide motivation and insight into why you might consider a short-term fast.

### Physical Benefits

- **Detoxification:** Your body gets a chance to eliminate toxins that have built up over time. This process can make you feel lighter and revitalized.
- **Weight Loss:** Fasting can facilitate rapid weight loss, primarily due to reduced calorie intake. Many find they lose several pounds during a 3-day fast.
- **Improved Insulin Sensitivity:** Fasting can enhance insulin sensitivity, helping your body manage blood sugar levels more effectively. This can be beneficial for those at risk of diabetes.
- **Cellular Repair:** During fasting, the body engages in autophagy, a process where cells clean out damaged components. This may help in maintaining overall cellular health.
- **Reduced Inflammation:** Water fasting may decrease inflammation in the body, which is linked to various chronic diseases.

### Emotional Benefits

This type of fasting can also lead to emotional growth and resilience. Consider the following aspects:

- **Connection to Hunger Signals:** You may discover a renewed sense of recognition toward genuine hunger signals, enabling better food choices in the future.

How a Short-Term Water Fast Affects Your Body
---------------------------------------------

Engaging in a short-term water fast can have numerous effects on your body. If you‚Äôre wondering how a three-day water fast might impact your health and well-being, you‚Äôre not alone. Many people are curious about the physical and mental changes that can occur during such a fasting period. In this article, we will delve into the potential benefits and effects of a three-day water fast, allowing you to make an informed choice.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
### Physical Benefits

One of the most immediate effects of a short-term water fast is detoxification. When you stop eating, your body begins to use stored energy, which can lead to the elimination of toxins. Here are some physical benefits you might experience:

- **Improved Digestion:** Giving your digestive system a break can rejuvenate it. You may notice less bloating and discomfort as your body focuses on healing.
- **Weight Loss:** A three-day water fast can lead to noticeable weight loss. This initially occurs through the loss of water weight, which may later transition into the use of fat stores for energy.
- **Reduced Inflammation:** Some studies suggest that fasting can help reduce inflammatory markers in the body. This can lead to improved joint health and reduced risk for chronic diseases.
- **Enhanced Cellular Repair:** Fasting triggers autophagy, a process where your body cleans out damaged cells and regenerates new ones. This can support overall health and longevity.

### Mental Effects

A three-day water fast doesn‚Äôt just affect your body; it can also lead to significant changes in your mental state. Here‚Äôs what you may experience mentally:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Increased Mental Clarity:** Many people report enhanced focus and clarity during a fast. With no food distractions, your brain may feel clearer and sharper.
- **Heightened State of Mind:** Some individuals find that fasting leads to feelings of euphoria or heightened energy. This can be attributed to the increase in neurotransmitters like norepinephrine, which boosts mood.
- **Improved Stress Management:** Fasting may increase resilience toward stressful situations. When you learn to manage your hunger, it can help you build mental fortitude.

### Metabolic Benefits

Water fasting also influences your metabolism. Below are notable effects it can have:

- **Insulin Sensitivity:** Short-term fasting can enhance insulin sensitivity, allowing your cells to respond better to insulin. This can help stabilize blood sugar levels.
- **Fat Burning:** As your body depletes its glycogen stores, it starts to burn fat for energy. This makes fasting a useful tool for some people aiming to lose weight.
- **Hormonal Changes:** Fasting can lead to increased levels of growth hormone, which supports fat loss and muscle preservation.

### Tips for a Successful Water Fast

If you decide to embark on a three-day water fast, here are some tips to help you along the way:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the fast. Staying hydrated is essential for your body's functions during this period.
- **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to how you feel. If you experience severe discomfort, it may be best to break the fast.
- **Plan Accordingly:** Schedule your fast during a time when you can rest and not be overly active. This will help you conserve energy.
- **Ease Back into Eating:** After your fast, gradually reintroduce food. Start with light, easily digestible foods to prevent stomach upset.

Engaging in a three-day water fast is not just about abstaining from food; it's a journey that may offer your body and mind a chance to reset. While everyone's experience may differ, many individuals find that the benefits extend well beyond the fasting period. Always consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any fasting regimen to ensure it‚Äôs safe for you. This considerate step can help ensure that your fasting journey is beneficial and tailored to your individual needs.

Mental Clarity and Focus During a Water Fast
--------------------------------------------

Engaging in a three-day water fast can be a transformative experience, offering various benefits that extend beyond physical health. One particularly significant advantage is the boost in mental clarity and focus. When you commit to a water-only diet for a short period, your body undergoes several changes that can enhance cognitive function.

During a fast, your body shifts its primary energy source from glucose to ketones, which are produced from fat. This shift often leads to heightened mental clarity. Many people report feeling sharper and more focused after just a day or two of fasting. This can be attributed to several factors:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Ketosis:** Once your body enters a state of ketosis, it uses fats for energy, which can lead to improved mental performance. Ketones are a more efficient fuel for the brain compared to glucose.
- **Reduced Brain Fog:** Many find that fasting helps clear mental fog. This clarity can be beneficial for tasks requiring concentration and cognitive effort.
- **Enhanced Neurotransmitter Production:** Fasting can increase levels of certain neurotransmitters, like norepinephrine, which can impact focus and mood positively.

Another way fasting can sharpen your mental acuity is by promoting autophagy, a process where your cells remove damaged components. This biological repair mechanism can lead to better overall brain health and function, allowing for clearer thinking.

Additionally, fasting gives you a break from your usual eating habits, which can disrupt your mental focus. When you stop consuming food, you also reduce distractions, allowing you to concentrate on your tasks more effectively. Without worrying about meals, cooking, or planning your diet, you can redirect your mental energy towards your goals.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Water fasting has also been shown to improve mindfulness. When you become aware of your hunger and thirst cues, you may find yourself more in tune with your thoughts and feelings. This self-awareness can lead to greater focus as you become less distracted by daily life‚Äôs noise.

- **Improved Mood:** A clear mind can lead to a better mood. Many people experience a sense of well-being and reduced anxiety during and after fasting. A positive mindset amplifies focus and mental clarity.
- **Heightened Creativity:** The clear-headedness gained from fasting can often lead to bursts of creativity. You may find solutions to problems that previously seemed insurmountable.

It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that the experience of fasting can vary significantly from one person to another. While some individuals feel sharper and enjoy enhanced focus, others may encounter challenges such as irritability or difficulty concentrating, especially in the first 24 hours. Understanding your body‚Äôs reaction and pacing yourself are crucial during a water fast.

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
Before embarking on a three-day water fast, it‚Äôs essential to prepare adequately. Start by reducing your intake of processed foods and sugars in the days leading up to the fast. This strategy helps your body adjust better when you start fasting. Staying well-hydrated with abundant water is critical, as hydration plays a vital role in maintaining focus and mental clarity.

Once in the fasting phase, pay attention to your energy levels and mental clarity. Many people notice significant improvements in cognitive function, which can last well beyond the fasting period. It's common for these benefits to linger, allowing you to carry a sense of focus and clarity into your daily activities.

To make the most of your mental clarity during a three-day water fast, consider engaging in activities that stimulate your mind. Reading, writing, or meditative practices can promote reflective thinking and deeper mental engagement. This practice can help you maximize the benefits of fasting.

A three-day water fast has the potential to enhance your mental clarity and focus significantly. By tapping into the natural processes of your body, you can achieve a clearer state of mind, heightened creativity, improved mood, and overall mental resilience. Just remember that individual experiences can vary, and it‚Äôs important to listen to your body's signals throughout the process.

### Prepare Your Body

- **Eat Whole Foods:** Focus on fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. This change may ease the transition.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water in the lead-up to your fast. Good hydration will help your body during the fasting period.
- **Avoid Processed Foods:** Steer clear of sugars and heavy meals. You want your body to be ready for a lighter state.

### Stay Hydrated

During your fast, water is your main source of intake. Ensure you drink enough to keep your body functioning well. Here are a few tips:

- **Monitor Your Intake:** Aim for about 2 to 3 liters of water daily, depending on your activity level.
- **Listen to Your Body:** If you feel thirsty, drink. Staying hydrated is essential for a successful fast.
- **Add Electrolytes:** You may consider adding a pinch of sea salt or electrolyte tablets to your water to maintain balance.

- **Hunger Pangs:** These are normal but can be uncomfortable. They usually subside after the first day.
- **Headaches:** A headache can be a sign of caffeine withdrawal or dehydration. Ensure you‚Äôre drinking enough water.
- **Fatigue:** If you feel overly tired, consider resting and reducing activity levels.

Keep a journal during your fast to document how you feel, which can help in future fasting attempts.

### Breaking the Fast

How you break your fast is just as important as the fast itself. Reintroducing food should be done carefully to avoid digestive distress. Follow these steps:

- **Start with Liquids:** Begin with vegetable broth or herbal tea, which is gentle on your stomach.
- **Gradual Return:** After a few hours, introduce easily digestible foods like fruits and steamed vegetables.
- **Avoid Heavy Meals:** Steer clear of meat and heavy dishes for at least 24 hours after you end your fast.

### Consult a Healthcare Professional

Prior to starting a water fast, especially a prolonged one, it is wise to discuss your plan with a healthcare provider. Some individuals may need to avoid fasting due to underlying health issues. A professional can provide guidance tailored to your individual situation and needs.

The Role of Hydration in Health and Wellness
--------------------------------------------

Staying hydrated plays a crucial role in overall health and wellness. Water is essential for multiple bodily functions, and understanding its importance can help you make better choices regarding your hydration needs.

### The Impact of Hydration on Your Body

Water makes up about 60% of your body weight and is vital to nearly every system in your body. Here are some key roles water plays:

Discover the Secret to the Best Infused Water for Health and Weight Loss ‚Äì Click Here: https://fastingonwater.com/  
  
- **Regulates Body Temperature:** Staying hydrated helps maintain your body‚Äôs temperature and prevents overheating, especially during exercise or hot weather.
- **Supports Cellular Functions:** Every cell in your body requires water to function properly. Cells use water to perform various biochemical reactions.
- **Aids Digestion:** Water is essential for digestion and helps dissolve nutrients, making them more accessible for absorption. It also helps prevent constipation by softening stools.
- **Enhances Nutrient Transport:** Water carries nutrients and oxygen to cells, ensuring that all body systems receive the necessary components to function optimally.

### Hydration and Mental Performance

Staying hydrated is not just important for physical health; it also significantly affects your mental well-being. Research indicates that even mild dehydration can impair cognitive functions such as attention, memory, and mood. When you drink enough water, you can experience:

- **Improved Concentration:** Hydration ensures your brain can focus and think clearly, making it easier for you to remain productive.
- **Better Mood Regulation:** Sufficient water intake can help minimize feelings of fatigue and anxiety, contributing to a more balanced emotional state.
- **Enhanced Memory:** Adequate hydration has been linked to improved memory retention and recall, especially during mentally demanding tasks.

### Hydration and Physical Performance

If you lead an active lifestyle or engage in regular exercise, hydration becomes even more critical. Here‚Äôs how proper fluid intake can benefit your workouts:

- **Increases Endurance:** When you are well-hydrated, your body can perform at a higher level for longer periods, helping you achieve fitness goals.
- **Reduces Muscle Fatigue:** Dehydration can lead to quicker fatigue and hinder performance. Staying hydrated allows your muscles to function efficiently.
- **Assists in Recovery:** Post-exercise hydration helps replenish lost fluids, aiding in quicker recovery and reducing soreness.

### How Much Water Do You Need?

The amount of water each person needs can vary based on several factors including age, weight, activity level, and climate. A general guideline is:

- About 3.7 liters (or 13 cups) for men
- About 2.7 liters (or 9 cups) for women

However, paying attention to your body's signals is vital. Thirst is a natural indicator that you need more fluids. Additionally, check the color of your urine‚Äîit should be light yellow. Dark urine can be a sign of dehydration.

### Tips for Staying Hydrated

Hydration into your daily routine doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. Use these strategies to ensure you‚Äôre drinking enough water:

- **Carry a Water Bottle:** Having a water bottle with you can serve as a reminder to drink throughout the day.
- **Set Reminders:** Use your smartphone to set reminders to drink water at regular intervals.
- **Flavor Your Water:** If plain water seems boring, try adding slices of fruits or herbs like lemon, cucumber, or mint to enhance the taste.

It's essential to recognize that other beverages, such as tea and coffee, and foods with high water content, like fruits and vegetables, also contribute to hydration. Nevertheless, water should remain your primary source of hydration.

Maintaining proper hydration is critical for your overall health. Whether it‚Äôs enhancing your physical performance, improving cognitive functions, or contributing to your emotional well-being, water plays an indispensable role in your daily life. Start prioritizing your hydration today for a healthier tomorrow!

### Conclusion

A 3-day water fast can be an eye-opening experience for many, offering numerous benefits that extend beyond mere physical changes. As you explored the various advantages, it‚Äôs clear that fasting not only affects your body but also enhances mental clarity and focus. During this short-term fast, your body enters a state of ketosis, using stored fats for energy, which can lead to improved metabolic health and even weight loss.

Mentally, many individuals report heightened awareness and improved cognitive function, making daily tasks feel more achievable. This mental boost can be attributed to the brain‚Äôs reliance on ketones for energy during fasting periods. As you consider trying a 3-day water fast, remember that preparation and safety are paramount.

1h80ady,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h80ady,Bookshelf help needed,"I just bought a house and have a big living room that I'm trying to furnish. I've book looking online an see a lot of stuff about how to mix dark and light wood but am not seeing much about non-wood furniture.

Here is what the space looks like right now. We bought this couch (will be in a corner that is directly across from the TV). We bought a wider TV console and have a black metal & glass coffee table that looks similar to this. All of that furniture will go in the same area in the living room. We are planning on moving the cat stuff from the corner and putting a bookshelf there. The light fixture there will be moved to another area.

My concern is that if we get a black bookshelf, it's going to be too much black furniture in the room. The doorway separates the bookshelf and TV stand so I feel like we could do something that isn't black but I'm not certain what would look good in the same room.

My alarm goes off, and I hit snooze, not because I‚Äôm lazy but because my body feels like it‚Äôs made of lead. When I finally drag myself out of bed, it‚Äôs already a fight to stay awake.

Coffee doesn‚Äôt help, but I drink it anyway, hoping for a placebo effect. Some days, I manage to hold it together, but the exhaustion is always there, lurking in the background. It‚Äôs not just physical; it‚Äôs mental. I‚Äôll try to concentrate on something, and my mind will just drift.

The worst part is when I feel a sleep attack coming. It‚Äôs like this wave of fatigue crashes over me, and I know I won‚Äôt be able to fight it. If I‚Äôm at home, I can lie down, but if I‚Äôm out? Forget it. I‚Äôve fallen asleep on buses, in waiting rooms, even once at a friend‚Äôs house during a party.

People don‚Äôt get how much this affects my life. They say things like, ‚ÄúJust take a nap‚Äù or ‚ÄúEveryone gets tired.‚Äù But this isn‚Äôt normal tiredness. This is like being dragged underwater while everyone else is swimming effortlessly above you.

I‚Äôm looking for a book recommendation of a FMC who is extreme endearing and inspirational in the way she handles herself and the situation around her without resorting to bitterness or resentment. 

Examples I have 
{After the night by Linda Howard} - I keep raving on and on about how much I love this book! Faith devlin is the GOAT in my opinion 

Because I liked this book, I read Howard‚Äôs other works and her other FMC embodied some of what I was looking for - e.g loving Evangeline! 

{Sweet dreams - by Kristen Ashley} - I loved the FMC Laurie, she shows up in a small town divorced, broken and overweight. She takes small steps to improve herself. I loved reading her journey‚Ä¶she got a job, lost weight, fell for a alpha male, enjoyed simple things like coffee and baked goods. 

I‚Äôm currently reading the second book in the series and i can‚Äôt do it - I‚Äôm skimming so fast and looking for some of the magic in the first book. This book has some scenes with Tate and Laurie - I‚Äôm only reading the book so I can read about them. You know a book is not for you when you get excited about previous books main leads. 

Other examples I liked - kiss an Angel, mmmmm did I mention after the night and sweet dreams? ",4,1733487399.0,RomanceBooks,8,0.84,False
1h801w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h801w1/where_can_you_buy_a_vitamix_blender/,Where can you buy a Vitamix blender?,"Hey everyone! I've been using my Vitamix blender for about three years now, and I get tons of questions about where to buy one. I thought I'd share my experience and help you find the best place to get your hands on these amazing machines.

I initially spent weeks researching different retailers and comparing prices. While you can find Vitamix blenders at various stores like Costco, Williams-Sonoma, and Best Buy, I've found that shopping online, specifically through Amazon, offers the best deals and warranty coverage.

Here's why I recommend buying through Amazon (https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender):

1. Competitive pricing - They frequently run sales and offer discounts
2. Free shipping with Prime
3. Genuine products with full manufacturer warranty
4. Easy returns if needed
5. Detailed product descriptions and customer reviews
6. Various models to choose from

Speaking from experience, my high-powered Vitamix has been a game-changer in my kitchen. I use it daily for smoothies, soups, nut butters, and even grinding coffee beans. The build quality is incredible - these things are built like tanks!

What really sold me was the versatility. Whether you're making frozen desserts, hot soups, or just wanting to pulverize some stubborn kale into submission, these blenders handle it all. Plus, the self-cleaning feature is a massive time-saver.

If you're ready to invest in a Vitamix, I highly recommend checking out the current prices and models on Amazon here: https://athometouch.com/vitamixblender

One quick tip: Keep an eye out for seasonal sales, especially during Black Friday and Prime Day. That's when you'll find the best deals on these professional-grade blenders.

Remember, while Vitamix blenders might seem pricey initially, they're a long-term investment. Mine has already outlasted three cheaper blenders I had before, and it's still going strong. The 7-year warranty gives great peace of mind too.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions about specific models or features - I'd be happy to share more about my experience.",1,1733487370.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

*Oh my stars, they‚Äôre so* ***red!***



The nipping winds and withering flurries of night's arrival weren‚Äôt being particularly kind on the Deweys as we made our way to the Warren‚Äôs door, tossing hair about and eliciting annoyed grunts and grumbles as they bundled up as tight as they could manage. The warm light and happy sounds of the Warren called out through the whipping night, putting a little more pep in their steps as the energy helped to drive the cold from their bones. Chris‚Äô fist rose to rap against the door, the sound stolen away by the howling wind as he and his family stood around me shivering through the cold. I still couldn‚Äôt help but let out a concerned purr at the adorable sight of Chris and his family huddled tight around me.



There was a time where it would‚Äôve sent me bolting into the fields to stand amongst predators like this but now? Now it was the best place on the arm to be‚Ä¶.



Well aside from *inside*.



A shear of warm, welcoming light cut from the door frame, casting long shadows across us as the old hinges let out a familiar squeal. Mama‚Äôs ecstatic whistles and beeps filled the air from behind the hefty slab of wood. ‚ÄúDo you *want* to fly away? Get in here and warm up!‚Äù



The crunch of gravel beneath feet and wheels answered her as we quickly filed inside, the haunting gales cut short and muffled as the door swung shut tight behind us, the soft crackle of the fire in the hearth accompanying the delectable spice of Hikic in the air. Chris let out a grunted thank you before vigorously shaking himself and his coat, casting a shower of flakes from his shoulders before slipping the curtain of blue fabric from his shoulders to hang on the rack beside the door and taking his family‚Äôs all the same. ‚ÄúThank you, Rensa, was startin‚Äô to get mighty cold.‚Äù



‚ÄúDon‚Äôt remember that it bothered you much before!‚Äù Mama teased, pulling me into a hug before turning to give him the same. Darlene, Michael and Anne stared wall eyed around the Warren taking everything in.¬†



‚ÄúYea an‚Äô ‚Äòbefore‚Äô the wind and the snow had a right mind to stay *separate*.‚Äù He countered with a broad smile as my tail found his wrist.¬†



‚ÄúOh they were just excited to welcome you and your *family*.‚Äù She whistled in reply, her tail tapping him on the side. *>Introductions?<*



‚ÄúRight, Ma‚Äô, Pa‚Äô, Anne‚Äô this is Rensa, Rensa this i-‚Äù



‚ÄúWonderful to finally meet you all in person!‚Äù Mama trilled, her tail whipping back and forth with amusement as Chris rolled his eyes while she padded to offer them a warm embrace. ‚ÄúIt helps to put a coa- er, *face* \-to a name!‚Äù



‚ÄúLikewise!‚Äù Darlene mused, stooping a touch to accept Mama‚Äôs hug, her eyes peering up at Chris‚Äô as a grin split her lips. ‚ÄúI trust he‚Äôs *behaved* himself?‚Äù



‚Äú*Ma!‚Äù*



‚ÄúWonderfully. Best help I think we‚Äôve ever had, not to mention how much he‚Äôs helped Taisa get up on her own two feet!‚Äù



*‚ÄúMama!‚Äù*



The pair burst into laughter as Papa came down the stairs, the steady *click-clack* of his claws accentuated by the faster and *far* more excited pitter patter of Renkel running down the hall to sneak a peak before bolting to Chris and I‚Äôs side. *>Excited! Home! New!<* ‚ÄúHi Chris! Did you bring anything new back?!‚Äù



A small smile tugged at his lips as he crouched down to my brother‚Äôs height, reaching into his pocket to pull out a small yellow box. ‚Äú‚ÄòTween these and my family I think you‚Äôve got enough new stuff for today, eh bud?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre those?‚Äù He gasped, staring at the box with wide eyes as his tail lashed back and forth ecstatically.¬†



‚ÄúFancy Chocolates!‚Äù Chris responded with a conspiratorial whisper as he shrouded Renkel from Mama and Papa‚Äôs view while they chatted with Anne, Darlene and Michael.¬†



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù Renkel whispered back, his paws tight to his chest as Chris slowly opened the box to show him the nine little morsels that waited within.¬†



‚ÄúTreats! A whole assortment of candies for you to try from back home so I know *just* what to get you next time.‚Äù Chris rumbled, the smile on his face growing as Renkel bounced in place. I felt a rush of bloom spread across my snout as he glanced up to me with a smirk before continuing. ‚ÄúThough you‚Äôre missin‚Äô three of ‚Äòem. ‚ÄòLeast I know which one your *Sister‚Äôs* favorites are!‚Äù



Renkel spun around to look up at me, his eyes wide with betrayal as he whispered. *>Shock!<* ‚ÄúYou ate my treats?‚Äù



‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt resist!‚Äù I whistled, holding my paws up as his ears dipped with a touch of sadness. ‚ÄúTwo had coffee in them and the other one had mint! I know how much you *hate* bitter bark and those sweetwaters Fenthel sells in hidden plains and Chris said they were basically the same.‚Äù¬†



He stuck his tongue out, a small *blech* tumbling past his teeth as he shook his head before plucking one from the box and popping it in his mouth with a resigned, dramatic sigh. ‚ÄúWell I *guess* that‚Äôs ok.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd he just eat?‚Äù Came Papa‚Äôs curious purr from over Chris‚Äô shoulder as he leaned past him to look down at his hands; sending a flush of red through his as we were caught slick-pawed, Renkel‚Äôs excited trills at the taste of his chocolate filling the bubble of silence around us.¬†

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶‚Äù Chris started, looking down at the box of chocolates for a moment before looking back up to meet Papa‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúA chocolate covered cherry?‚Äù

Papa shook his head, his tail curling with amusement as he watched Renkel happily dance about as he chewed his treat. ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt go giving him *too* much, I‚Äôve got dinner cooking and I‚Äôd *hate* to have you two spoil his appetite.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt Papa!‚Äù *>Sorry! Thank you!<* ¬†I whistled, giving him a small hug as Renkel bounded back over to Chris‚Äô side, nodding vigorously before eagerly accepting another one when Chris asked if he liked them. ‚ÄúYesh!‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like someones an easy buy!‚Äù Chris replied with a grin, ruffling Renkel‚Äôs crown as I gave him a small nuzzle before whispering in his ear.¬†

‚ÄúGet me more of those coffee chocolates and I just might get tha-‚Äù

‚ÄúOh look at you!!!‚Äù I jumped with a start, my wool flaring at the sound of Darlene‚Äôs excited cooing as she and Mama stooped down at Renkel‚Äôs side, Anne rolling to a stop a short tail away earning an excited *>Hello!<* from him as he chewed at the next chocolate. ‚ÄúMy god you are even more adorable than I could‚Äôve imagined now ain‚Äôt‚Äôcha!‚Äù

Renkel‚Äôs tail set to wagging as fast as it could manage as he looked to Mama for permission before giving Darlene as big a hug as he could manage while beeping out an ecstatic greeting. Darlene seemed to melt in his grasp, looking down with that same pitiful face I‚Äôd seen on Chris‚Äô face all too many times when my brother was involved. Stars above was he good at getting what he wanted from Humans.

*Like grease at his claws‚Ä¶ wonder if he knows he‚Äôs doin‚Äô it.*

Chris turned, his eyes alight with happiness as his hand slipped around my waist, pulling me close to pour a curious whisper back into my own ear. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get what now?‚Äù

My tail curled with mischief as I stuck out my tongue past the purr rolling in my throat and pressed into his side. ‚ÄúGet those chocolates and find out.‚Äù

‚ÄúPain in my ass.‚Äù He chuckled, giving me a small kiss on the crown before turning to look for his father and Papa as Darlene reached over and lifted the box of chocolates from his hand, pointing as she explained what each chocolate was to Mama and Renkel. ‚ÄúNow, where‚Äôn the hell did Pa‚Äô get off to?‚Äù

We meandered from the room, the ecstatic, barking laugh from Darlene fading into the background as we turned into the hall leading to Chris‚Äô room and followed the murmur of Papa and Michael chatting about something I couldn‚Äôt *quite* make out. Chris eased the door open, leaning in to look at the pair with a raised eyebrow before letting out a laugh as we found the pair stood at the foot of his bed, Michael excitedly inspecting the joints Papa and Chris had worked to make.¬†

‚ÄúDamn if that ain‚Äôt fine work, Taikel.‚Äù Michael mused, running a finger along the dark wood and tracing the grain. ‚ÄúNeed to get me some more of this stuff, it‚Äôs been a *joy* to work with!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh well I‚Äôm sure we know a pair who‚Äôd be *happy* to bring some on home for ya‚Äô at some point.‚Äù Papa chuffed, looking up into the rafters to point to one of the joists he and Chris had lifted before noticing us. ‚ÄúNow those were a real pain in the tai- Oh! There you two are!‚Äù

‚ÄúHaving fun, Pops?‚Äù Chris rumbled, a glint of pride in his eyes as Michael ran his finger through the carvings he and Papa had put on the bed frame.¬†

‚ÄúOh boy you know I‚Äôm havin‚Äô a right *time* here!‚Äù He responded, pride filling his voice while a broad grin split his lips as he strode to pull his son into a hug. ‚ÄúTo think my boy was here makin‚Äô furniture with aliens while‚Äôs I‚Äôs just sittin‚Äô at home!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell that and renovations.‚Äù Chris agreed, nodding to Papa. ‚ÄúWe had a helluva time getting those joists cut, lifted and secured again. Damned good thing these burrow houses are built damned tough.‚Äù

‚ÄúStanding for **\[334 Solar Years\]**!‚Äù *>Pride!<* Papa chimed in, running a paw across the wall. ‚ÄúBeen bouncing about our family for near **\[2 Solar Centuries\]** now.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn‚Äô hopefully for a few hund‚Äôd more.‚Äù Michael replied with a small smile, marveling at the etchings and carvings that danced across the beams in the ceilings. ‚ÄúGive ‚Äòer ‚Äònough time‚Äôn your sister‚Äôd have a helluva time in this house.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe figured she would.‚Äù I whistled, gently placing a paw on Chris‚Äô back.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got a standing invitation to visit whenever she wants.‚Äù Papa continued, leaning on the edge of the bed. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt guarantee we‚Äôll have all the answers she‚Äôs looking for but I think Heartwood would *love* to have her around, Stars know Colthen in the library would chat her ears off if she let her!‚Äù

‚ÄúI think she‚Äôd like that‚Ä¶‚Äù Michael trailed off, gazing about the room at all the little odds and ends Chris and I had picked up on our trips with *Shamrock*. ‚ÄúI think she‚Äôd like that alot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell *that* sounds like dinner talk then!‚Äù Papa bleated, padding from the room and stumbling over the Human word a little as he kept his tail high and confident. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a few ideas but I would *love* to get Darlene‚Äôs help with it if I can manage to!‚Äù

‚ÄúA chance to cook on a different planet with new friends? I don‚Äôt know that you could stop her from helping even if‚Äôn you wanted to!‚Äù Michael agreed, following close behind as he peered into ever picture frame with unbridled curiosity and wonder. ‚ÄúHell, if‚Äôn you‚Äôve the time I wouldn‚Äôt mind a tour of that shop of yours!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm *sure* we can make the time!‚Äù *>Count on it! Excitement!<* Papa chuckled before launching into describing all manner of projects he had been planning to get to work on when he‚Äôd found the time as the pair meandered down the hall out into the kitchen.

‚ÄúWell they seem to be gettin‚Äô on well.‚Äù Chris rumbled, his fingers working their way through my wool as I pressed in a little closer.

‚ÄúExpect anything less?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but its nice to see, ‚Äòleast your Mama‚Äôs givin‚Äô them a better greetin‚Äô than I got!‚Äù

‚ÄúStars I think it‚Äôd be hard to beat *that* introduction!‚Äù I laughed with a purr, tapping his back with my tail before wrapping it around his wrist again to lead him out to the hall. ‚ÄúBesides! Before too long there might be a few *more* pictures with Humans up around here!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt doubt that for a *second*, Darlin‚Äô.‚Äù He smiled, following along at my side as we stepped out into the kitchen to find Papa and Michael excitedly chatting in the kitchen over the work Papa and I had done when I was still a pup.

Renkel all but hung from Darlene‚Äôs side, soaking up every drop of information she had for him about how chocolates were made and what *her* favorites were. If she wasn‚Äôt careful he might decide to take up *another* new interest! Mama was a tail away, fondly watching the pair chatter as Renkel jumped in place and let out an ecstatic squeal as Darlene handed him another piece of candy.

*>Silly Pup.<*

Mama‚Äôs tail swayed gently at the sight as she shook her head with amusement. She stopped for a moment, looking over her shoulder to find Anne sat a few tails away looking up at basin of pictures hung on the walls.¬†

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Mama whistled, striding a little closer to Anne to look up at the old picture she was examining. ‚ÄúThat ones a favorite of mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù Anne asked, shifting her gaze to Mama as I tugged Chris‚Äô attention to the pair.

‚ÄúThe paw Taikel and I got married, doing our portion of his family‚Äôs [*Vyalkit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/12fxsxi/foundations_of_humanity_17_promises_an_nop_fanfic/), unfortunately it‚Äôs at his Sister‚Äôs burrow in Hidden Valley so I can‚Äôt show you it in *person*. Stars, I had to grow my wool out for a full ***three harvests*** before it was long enough to use!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúTo use?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor the bindings and the weave.‚Äù Mama answered, her ears dipping in thought before she scampered to the hearth to grab the polished, Amarek box that she kept atop the mantle. Anne looked on curiously as she clacked the boxes latches open, producing a pair of paw bindings that twisted and swirled with her and Papa‚Äôs wool. ‚ÄúA pair of paw bindings! Meant to give up some of your own warmth to keep your new family warm!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù Anne breathed, staring down at the binding until Mama gently placed it into her hands.¬†

‚ÄúI thought so too.‚Äù Mama agreed, her tail wagging back and forth the fastest I‚Äôd seen it since the bombings as she continued. ‚ÄúWhere I come from that‚Äôs not what we do though. On the day side we can‚Äôt keep our wool *quite* long enough for that so, *instead*\-‚Äù

She pitched up, pointing across the Warren to the clacking beads in the dining room. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd grow out *parts* of our wool to shear, mix and turn into singular unbroken threads to mark with life‚Äôs biggest events!‚Äù

Anne studied them for a moment, her eyes flitting from bead to bead until it landed on the singular black bead from all those harvests ago.

‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶‚Äù She stopped, tears welling in her eyes as her hand drifted to the joint of her prosthetic. ‚ÄúIs that the same one Chris has? The one he got for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶ But you‚Äôre still here.‚Äù A few, careful steps led Mama to Anne‚Äôs side, waiting a moment as she watched Anne‚Äôs hand , her tail curling with pained sympathy as she placed a gentle paw on her shoulder.¬†

‚ÄúIt gets better‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the docs keep saying.‚Äù Anne agreed, pursing her lips and closing her eyes before taking a deep, rattling breath. ‚ÄúI just wish it‚Äôd get better *faster*.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I had a rough time of it when I‚Ä¶‚Äù Mama paused, furrowing her ears as she thought. ‚ÄúI shut myself out from the world. Quit the office when it didn‚Äôt go the way I wanted, holed up in bed every paw. I was ready to let it all go because I felt alone. Like no one understood‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúBut?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut they *didn‚Äôt*. The office didn‚Äôt, *couldn‚Äôt*, understand it.‚Äù She sighed, shaking her ears with regret. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt make any sense to them that someone who‚Äôd been mauled by a predator could advocate for‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIts ok.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor predators to be given some consideration for their *disposal*‚Ä¶‚Äù Mama shuddered, the regret deepening as she shrunk in on herself a little. ‚ÄúBut do you know who *did* understand? Who was there for me through it all?‚Äù

Anne shook her head, staring at the wall as Mama continued to talk.

‚ÄúMy family. Taisa and Taikel were there trying to get me up and moving every paw. [Trying to keep me comfortable, to make me *happy*.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureofPredators/comments/1bhk6ce/when_night_falls_an_lom_fanfic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) To help me *through* it.‚Äù Mama‚Äôs paw squeezed a little, bringing Anne‚Äôs attention back onto her as she finished with a whisper I could barely harvest. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got people here for you, people that care and know you can make it through this. Stars, your brother and Taisa flew you and your parents to a different *planet* to help!‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess I do, don‚Äôt I‚Ä¶‚Äù A small smile broke Anne‚Äôs saddened features, her eyes darting over to Chris and I for a moment before turning back to Mama. ‚ÄúThank you, Rensa.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnytime, Anne.‚Äù *>Here for you.<* Mama purred, looking up to the pictures again before reaching up to tap an old picture of me as a pup clutching an old impeller. ‚ÄúNow, *this one* is from Taisa‚Äôs first paw at scho-‚Äù

*Oh stars please not this one again!*

I grabbed Chris‚Äô wrist hauling him away as fast as I could while a small laugh tumbled from his throat. He did his best to still listen in on Mama‚Äôs favorite story again while I did my best to drag him out of earshot and into¬† the kitchen.

Darlene rose to her feet across the room, the sound of Renkel‚Äôs overjoyed squeals filling the air alongside her laughs as she hefted him into the air and onto her hip, striding to the kitchen with a broad smile on her face. ‚ÄúMichael, can I steal your new friend for a bit?‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòCourse Darlin‚Äô.‚Äù Michael replied, easing onto a stool at the island with a pleasant sigh before he took a long sip of his Hikic.¬†

‚ÄúWonderful!‚Äù She all but shouted, gently bouncing on her feet to the tune of Renkel‚Äôs giggles. ‚ÄúNow, Taikel, if you‚Äôre ready to get started on your idea for tomorrow I‚Äôd just *love* to see what you had in mind!‚Äù

‚ÄúI would *love* to!‚Äù Papa‚Äôs ears rose with excitement as he turned from his mug of Hikic, tail wagging excitedly as a sly smile broke across Michaels lips. ‚ÄúSo, I was thinking about making a few of your dishes with a blend of Venlil and Human ingredients for the festival! Lentan wants to try and show solidarity with the Humans at the shelters to help coax them out of their burrows!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Darlene asked, easing Renkel to the floor as she kept her attention on Papa, sending the pup bolting across the room to Mama and Anne whistling excitedly about his new favorite chocolates. ‚ÄúWhich dishes?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù Papa hummed, grabbing his pad and searching for a moment before stopping and doing his best at wrapping his tongue around the words with surprising success. ‚ÄúRed-Beans and Rice‚Ä¶ Gumbo‚Ä¶ Eto‚Ä¶ Edtoufet? And Benets?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo outta three ain‚Äôt half bad.‚Äù Darlene chuckled, taking a few steps to look over his shoulder at the pad before continuing. ‚ÄúWhat changes would you want to make?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I think we could use Brightstar beans instead of the ‚ÄòRed-Beans‚Äô, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre *terribly* different, Milled Ipsom instead of flour in the roux and I‚Äôve got a couple options to add to your ‚ÄòHoly Trinity‚Äô to give it a more local taste‚Ä¶‚Äù *>Worry.<* Papa‚Äôs ears twitched with apprehension as Darlene listened, looking up to the ceiling while she thought about the proposed changes.¬†

‚ÄúI think some of those could work, if I‚Äôm remembering the names of what you sent me right. Sure, lets give it a shot! Not everyday you get to help pioneer Venlil-Cajun or Venlil-Creole fusion!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCareful ‚Äòere Tai‚Äô.‚Äù Chris rumbled with bright eyes as he ran his fingers through my tail tuft. ‚ÄúGet her *too* excited about pioneering new food and she just might decide to stay and open up another restaurant again!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh hush you!‚Äù Darlene chided, a broad smile on her face as she pointed to her son. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôd give you two extra work haulin‚Äô produce from home, now wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Papa‚Äôs ears shot up with excitement at her enthusiasm, and Chris‚Äô joke, a small overjoyed beep escaping his mouth before coalesscing into more coherent words. ‚ÄúThen there‚Äôs not a moment to waste!‚Äù

The two turned and set to it, Darlene inspecting Papa‚Äôs kitchen ware that looked *terribly* too small for her hands as Papa all but dove into the fridge, producing bag after bag of produce for them to experiment with. A few paces behind me I heard the *tak-clunk* of Mama approaching, an amused purr pouring from her throat as she settled into the stool at my side, watching Papa and Darlene set to work.

A small whisper drifted through the Warren, finding my ear and bringing my attention back to Renkel standing at Anne‚Äôs side with wide, hopeful eyes. ‚ÄúDo you wanna see my fishies? O-Or my books?‚Äù

Anne paused for a moment, pulling her attention from her Mother and Papa‚Äôs work to look down at the hopeful ball of wool beside her. ‚ÄúI would love to, Renkel.‚Äù

I felt a weight fall from my shoulders as I looked around the scene before me, took in the reality that they were getting along. That I‚Äôd found such warmth in my life even past Night‚Äôs gnawing cold. That things were going *right*. That everyone was happy. That the paw had been a success.

And that the next one would be even bet-

**Memory Transcription Subject: Malins, Krakotl Captain, Owner Operator of Federation Shipping Vessel** ***Inatala‚Äôs Grace*** **of the Nishtalian Hauling Corporation.**

Date \[Standardized Human Time\]: November 11th, 2136

Something was wrong with Route B-654. Three ships gone in the wind within **\[1 Earth Month\]** on a route that rarely broke more than two ‚ÄòFailure to Report‚Äôs in **\[1 Solar Year\]**. Something was causing this.



*Inatala‚Äôs Grace* hummed beneath my claws as I paced before my viewscreen, ruffling feathers as I thought through every possibility¬†



It could‚Äôve been accidental, the Lane Keepers often slacked on less important branch routes and an uncharted planetoid in the area could *certainly* cause a problem. But others had made it by fine in that time and hadn‚Äôt reported anything.



Simple failures? Failures and poor maintenance harvested more than their fair share of careless captains and companies these days. Coincidence struck as odd but anything was certainly possible in the void and I‚Äôd seen *stranger*.



*The Arxur?*



I shuddered at the thought. Nishtal was rendered naught but cinders and ash to the winds, and in their wake, sordid truth I still could not bring myself to believe had spread of my people. True or not‚Ä¶



My feathers flared, driving the thought away as I turned to the next thought, the Arxur were possible but this far into Federation territory? Even with the Fleet so devastated it was unthinkable. That left only one other option.



Humans.



No‚Ä¶ We‚Äôd know if their fleets had slipped their collars and set about terrorizing shipping lanes.



Would we?



*Inatala only knows anymore‚Ä¶*¬†



*The crew must stay alert, rogue planetoids, Arxur raids or Human cruelty, none of them bode well.*

These forced everyday lunches with my coworkers began to unfold into a silent war of cheapness and fake smiles. 

Coworker started to do extra chores like pouring coffee for higher ups and buying Indian takeaway from a shady guy at the metro station. The hour plus long commute began to wear on me each day. Another coworker keeps getting help and big projects because he and the senior speak the same language. Besides all that the atmosphere really felt stale, fake, and boring. I tried making connections but ultimately they didn‚Äôt seem to care much. 

I didn‚Äôt see any future in that place so I left and started my own business. Although first year was hard I still managed to break even and we have a core following of loyal customers. I traded in a stable career to build a dream of my own. ",7,1733487104.0,antiwork,2,1.0,False
