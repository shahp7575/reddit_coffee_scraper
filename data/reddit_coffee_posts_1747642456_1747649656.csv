I've looked at the FAQ, but none of the cocktail bars I have marked down seem to be listed, so I thought I'd throw them out and see if any locals (or visitors) had any opinions.

I'm looking for more refined cocktails, maybe bespoke, especially whisky based. I loved to talk to the bartenders (when not busy) and talk about our tastes, and have them make something for me after ordering one or two off the menu. I speak Japanese, so language isn't a barrier. I'll be going solo or one or two business colleagues.

These are the ones I've found, mostly on multiple recommend lists, all in the Susukino area:

* Deux Ermitage
* Yamazaki
* Bar Proof
* Bar Nano Femto
* Suntory Bar Stylish D
* Evening
* Bar Rhyton

While I'm at it, these are the coffee places I have picked out:

* Brew it by Node
* Oniyanma Coffe & Beer
* D-Life Place Sapporo
* Tokei no inai Kissaten

Anyone been to any of these or know of others like them (coffee or cocktails)? Thanks!",1,1747649561.0,Sapporo,0,1.0,False
1kq82h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1kq82h0/help_with_dialling_in_my_coffee/,Help with dialling in my coffee,"Hey everyone,

I am currently using a medium roast that‚Äôs 80% arabica and 20% robusta from a specialty Italian roaster called Picapau. I have always used their coffees for espresso, it‚Äôs the first time I am using them for moka. 

I am trying to find the right grind size on my Kingrinder K6, I have tried from 45 clicks all the way down to 37. At 37 it was overly bitter, so I won‚Äôt go lower than that.

My issue is that I am not able to bring out any other aroma out of this coffee other than bitterness. At 45 clicks the bitterness is very light, not disturbing, but it‚Äôs the only thing I can taste, nothing else. I know this roaster, I know they are quality, so I don‚Äôt think the beans are the problem. 

I‚Äôm at a point where I can‚Äôt tell at all if I am over or under extracted. That intense bitterness at 37 clicks made me think that I was over extracted. What can I do to bring out more flavour out of this coffee? It tastes very flat. 

For context, I use 90¬∞C water, put a low heat and always maintain a very slow and steady flow. I have a two cup induction bialetti moka. ",1,1747649551.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

I hate my tap water for making coffee. It's the only thing standing between me and better coffee, and now I want to fix it.

I've come to the conclusion that a RO-system is probably the best way to get there. I have a TDS of around 309 in the regular tap water with a Ph of 7,6, and other then being very hard it is totally drinkable and fine. But garbage for coffee.

So I need a RO-system with remineralization to get me somewhere better, and I'm hoping someone on here can recommend a system that works for coffee water. It will more or less be used exclusively   for that, so it doesn't need to replace the entire watersupply.

Also:

\- I need a simple solution from a end-user perspective. Using a Zero Water pitcher and adding minerals back in is a no go, due to being more complex then needed

\- Buying distilled or demineralized water and dosing up with minerals is too expensive here, and the complexity of ""please don't use the tap water but instead this special jug of water over here"" is moving into the ""that's too complex"" territory

So a RO-system that takes over a single tap in the kitchen seems to be the only option left from what I can gather.

Can anyone recommend a good RO-system that remineralization the water to a good coffee range? I know BWT makes one focused on specialty coffee, but that seems to be available only in the B2B market.",0,1747649286.0,JamesHoffmann,0,0.5,False

1kq7xwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyperacusis/comments/1kq7xwm/hear_we_go_again/,"""Hear"" we go again...","Back in June of 2024, I randomly developed an ear infection in my left ear. This came with sensitivity to deep bass like sounds. I was given some otigo drops and after about a week it subsided. However, I was invited to a weekend at my friend's house an basically got landed in an extremely loud situation which also resulted in me catching covid. All of my H came back but the symptoms were only in my right ear. 

I pretty much isolated from the world for 4 months. I could only leave the house at night because the sound of cars hurt to much, I developed a stutter becuase i was going so long without seeing or speaking to poeple. I tried max doses of prednisone. random peptides off the Internet, various supplements. Red light therapy. I threw everything I could at this, I genuinely didn't care if I lived or not. 

Around the six month mark it had pretty much gone, tiny bit of sensitivity in my right ear to very particular sounds but yeah I could go out again, I could see people again, go to coffee shops, watch TV! I still have a bit of a stutter but I felt like I was given my life back.

Until last month. 

I had a fizzing sound in my left ear for a few weeks an figured I'd go get it looked at. Yup, ear infection. Now during this I had practically ZERO symptoms with my H. But I was given some spray to clear the infection an told I'm likely just prone to ear infections in my left ear. Fast forward 2 weeks all was well. The infection had gone but I noticed that my LEFT ear was developing some real sensitivity to sound. Alongside some pretty mild yet noticeable T in my left ear. 

Now I'd had set backs before but none of them left me with a bad episode for more than a few days, hell, with some ear protection I could do MRIs without my H coming back at all. 

But this one feels different, if I talk it gets worse. I have this constant fluttering sensation in the morning that kicks my H upto 11. I can't watch TV, listen to music, talk to friends, even go to therapy. 

There's a part of me that thinks ""I got better before an i will again"" 

But this almost ended me last time, I aged so much in those months. Lost so much weight just from the stress. 

I am hoping I come back from this quicker than I did before but who knows with this condition. 

Just wanted to get that out, I'll let you know if I get better.

The taper from 100mg to 0 lasted about 3 months. During that time, I also practiced therapeutic fasting (I didn‚Äôt eat anything from morning until I got home from work, but I drank water and had two coffees).

During the process, I started experiencing symptoms like burning in the mouth, a dry slightly white tongue, throat irritation, and occasionally a dull stomach ache.

At the end of February, I visited a general practitioner who suggested it might be reflux and prescribed a PPI (20mg pantoprazole). I also got tested for candida and oral bacteria, which came back negative. A general blood test also showed normal results. I didn‚Äôt want to take the medication initially and avoided it until mid-March. Unfortunately, the symptoms started to worsen, so I went to an ENT specialist. He examined my throat and mouth, noted that my throat was inflamed, and agreed it was likely reflux, recommending that I take the PPI. That‚Äôs when I started the medication. I took it for two weeks, and things did start to improve slightly. I had to stop PPi 2 weeks before gastroscopy and I‚Äôm not taking it anymore since.

At the beginning of May, I saw a gastroenterologist, who referred me for a gastroscopy, abdominal ultrasound, and blood tests for the pancreas, liver, insulin, and TSH.

The gastroscopy didn‚Äôt show any changes in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum, and the Helicobacter test came back negative. The ultrasound revealed fatty liver, with other organs appearing normal, except the pancreas wasn‚Äôt clearly visible. All the blood tests were within normal ranges ‚Äî blood sugar, liver function, pancreatic enzymes, and thyroid function were all fine.

Since May, I‚Äôve been following a strict low-carb diet. I‚Äôve eliminated tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, all sugar (because of flare up after this food) and stopped consuming caffeine. There‚Äôs been minimal improvement. I‚Äôve lost weight ‚Äî from 113kg (249lbs) to 107.8kg (237lbs). I‚Äôm 188cm (6‚Äô2‚Äù) tall and consume about 2000 kcal daily.

Fashion trends come and go ‚Äî but comfort? That‚Äôs always in style.

And in 2025, one classic bottomwear piece is quietly winning the everyday wardrobe game: **Cotton trousers for men**. Whether you're dressing up for brunch, heading to the office, or just going on a chill walk, these pants are showing up and showing out.

But wait‚Äîaren‚Äôt they just ‚Äúsimple pants‚Äù?

**Far from it.** Let‚Äôs break down why these laid-back legends are quietly becoming a staple in every man‚Äôs closet.

**‚òÅÔ∏è Comfort That Looks Good**

Let‚Äôs face it ‚Äî nobody wants to feel stiff all day. [**Cotton trousers men**](https://jimmyluxury.in/collections/cotton-cargo) bring in that soft, breathable vibe that works great from AM to PM.

And we‚Äôre not talking about shapeless pajama-style lowers. Today‚Äôs cotton trousers are:

* Tailored but relaxed  
* Stretchy but structured  
* Smart-looking but not too ‚Äúformal-formal‚Äù  

**Result?** You feel like you‚Äôre jogging‚Ä¶ but you look like you‚Äôre ready for work or coffee.

# üß© Versatility Level: üî•

Here‚Äôs where cotton trousers really shine: you can literally wear them anywhere.

* To the office (pair them with loafers and a crisp white shirt)  
* For travel days (team them with sneakers and a tee)  
* On dates (go for earth tones + a half-sleeve printed shirt)  

There‚Äôs even cropped versions, drawstring styles, and chinos‚Äîall under the ‚Äúcotton trouser‚Äù umbrella.

You can dress ‚Äòem up or down depending on the vibe.

# üîë Why 2025 is All About Cotton Bottoms

* **Sustainability**: Cotton is eco-friendlier than synthetic materials  
* **Climate-ready**: Light cotton weaves are perfect for warmer seasons  
* **Minimalist trend**: Men are leaning into versatile, timeless basics

# üõçÔ∏è What to Look For Before You Buy

If you‚Äôre shopping for cotton trousers, check:

* Fabric blend: 100% cotton or cotton + elastane for a slight stretch  
* Fit type: Tapered or relaxed depending on body shape  
* Pockets: Flat or utility style? Choose what suits your lifestyle  
* Color: Neutrals like beige, khaki, olive, navy = most wearable  

üí° **Pro Tip:** Avoid overly tight fits ‚Äî cotton isn‚Äôt meant to cling, it‚Äôs made to breathe.

Beneath the cherry blossoms, beneath the neon-glow vending machines, there was always a buzz.

Maybe except around¬†**one man**.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In 2018, a man called Shoji Morimoto was criticized at his workplace. His superior told that he lacked proactiveness and intent to initiate. He was fired from his job since he boss considered that he was ‚Äúnot doing anything‚Äù of value for the company.

This is where the fun starts, he decided to earn his livelihood by ‚Äúnot doing anything‚Äù.

‚ÄúOkay, but how?‚Äù is the natural question anybody would ask.

While initially this was a strange idea, his business picked up and he was soon flooded with requests, As of today, he makes a whopping $80000 a year from ‚Äòdoing nothing‚Äô.

He doesn‚Äôt pretend to be your friend. He doesn‚Äôt fake enthusiasm. He just shows up. And sometimes, that‚Äôs exactly what people need.

His typical conversation probably looks something like this:

*‚ÄúAre you really just going to sit there?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúYes.‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúNot going to judge me?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúNo.‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúNot even if I eat all of this sushi alone?‚Äù*  
*‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here.‚Äù*

In a city of excess, he sold emptiness.

According to Morimoto, he receives about 1,000 requests per year. He charges a flat rate of between 10,000 yen and 30,000 yen ($65 to $195) for a 2 to 3 hour session, and earned around $80,000 last year.

**Why the business works (Especially in Japan)**

1. Japanese society often values restraint and quiet dignity. Morimoto fits perfectly: he offers company without intrusion.
2. For anyone who‚Äôs uncomfortable eating alone or people who feel socially anxious, he‚Äôs a neutral, calming presence.
3. Many feel tired of being ‚Äúon‚Äù all the time. Morimoto allows people to drop the mask ‚Äî for a fee.

Also a lot of his clients‚Äô requests are strange and include:

1. Reminding a woman to send a message reminding them to cut her nails before having coitus with her husband.
2. Sit beside someone who‚Äôs writing their thesis.
3. Join a woman who didn‚Äôt want to visit a divorce lawyer alone.
4. Walk silently with someone who missed their deceased dog.
5. Eat dinner with a client at a Michelin-starred restaurant ‚Äî without speaking.

Morimoto insists that he doesn‚Äôt give any life advice to his clients. He was just a passive listener who helps out people.

He made a living out of¬†**doing nothing**¬†‚Äî while dining at the best restaurants in Tokyo, with strangers who left a little lighter than they came.

While it started as a meme-worthy idea, Morimoto has since inspired¬†**books, documentaries, and now global interest**. He has directly challenged notion that value must come from doing. Sometimes,¬†**value lies in simply being.**

Morimoto has also authored a quirky memoir titled ‚Äú*Rental Person Who Does Nothing‚Äù. H*is memoir is very philosophical, looking at why people are renting his services. A simple example would be a cafe owner, who does not want empty seats when it opens. This is where Morimoto comes to have a coffee at opening time, then sees more people coming in.

Morimoto has convincingly made people believe that he is a lazy, ‚Äòdo-nothing‚Äô person, while in reality he‚Äôs a genius. He‚Äôs also kind, never belittling his clients‚Äô requests and generous too. It‚Äôs worth reading about Morimoto‚Äôs business, his rules for accepting or rejecting jobs and why it is successful.",8,1747648306.0,neverchangejapan,0,0.83,False

Pinaka-nagustuhan ko sa ka nya ay yung 180¬∞ view ‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ para akong nasa condo but super mura, and nasa 2nd floor ako and 3 unit renters lng kami dun sa floor, super tahimik. Sobrang hangin ng place and very ventilated tapos as observant person andami kong nakikita.

Kaso heto na nga at my first month biglang umulan ng malakas this April. So bale dumiretso siya sa bintana ko yung ulan kahit closed na kasi very open yung terrace hanggang umabot kahit sa pinto (but it's only one incident kasi summer parin naman).

I asked my landlady to take care of it like maglagay ng trapal sa windows na pwede ibaba kasi yung nasa ilalim ko na waterproof cover sa bed nilagay ko temporarily, and they responded that they will find a way.

After few days, I didn't know gumawa pala sila ng metal frame with big waterproof plywood etc tapos pinako at hinarang nila mismo sa terrace with a little space sa ilalim. So Goodbye View and light, kahit sampayan, Goodbye. ü§¶

Medyo nawindang nalang ako at nanghinayang kasi balak ko pa naman maglagay ng coffee table sa labas para every morning, dun ako tatambay, pero ngayon ekis na.üò≠ Patanggal ko ba sa knila?

I lied on my CV and somehow convinced everyone I'm a coding wizard. Now I'm stuck in an endless loop of Google searches and coffee-fueled late-night coding sessions. And this is where I regret it. I really, really regret it.

I learned coding on the job, which is basically a fancy way of saying I'm making it up as I go. My colleagues think I'm a genius, but the truth is I'm just good at hiding my anxiety.

When they ask me to explain my code, I confidently launch into a speech full of heavy jargon, hoping they'll get lost in all the convoluted talk.

1kq7mle,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1kq7mle/different_kind_of_post/,Different Kind of Post,"I haven't seen a post from the perspective I'm in yet, and I've searched a bit through this group. 

My boyfriend's ex wife has BPD. I haven't personally met her yet, but they were together for over a decade and share 3 children. I'm not going to get into details of their relationship, but I think it is sufficient to say she was very abusive in many different ways that I see a lot of you all have experienced. 

I am writing because I need to know if I and my kids are safe. 

My boyfriend and I work at the same place. They have been separated for over a year and a half now, but she drives by multiple times a day, and where we with is in the middle of nowhere, you don't ""drive past"" on your way to anywhere, you can only drive past if you are specifically going there. I know for a fact she is stalking him and has been the entire time they've been separated, sometimes even with the kids with her, but in effect, because we are together often, she is stalking me as well. She was tracking his location and would send him messages with cryptic details about where he was, and she's discovered where I live as well. It turns out she was using their daughter to track him, with whom he shared his location to help comfort her (she's very attached to him and does not show symptoms of BPD), and also tracking her daughters location when she suspected she was with me.

She has now begun imitating me. She goes to the places I enjoy going to, which are very much not her kind of thing. I enjoy coffee shops, independent stores, and trail running. She called him screaming about how she can't find a specific nature preservation that I have been going to since I was a child. She can't find it because 15 years ago they changed their name, but because I went as a child, I still call it the old name and her kids are calling it the old name because they don't know the new one. I took them all hiking there. She took her kids to a tiny hole-in-the-wall specialty shop that's 45 minutes away from where she lives and she had no idea existed. She has begun hanging out in the town I grew up in and go to often, which, again, is nearly an hour away from her and she never really showed interest in before.

As I mentioned before, I haven't met her personally, but it's because of comments she made that made me feel my children were unsafe. I was open to meeting her when she originally asked, as I would want to know who my kids are around as well, and my boyfriend has met my ex. But when I agreed to meeting her, she went on to say ""we'll get together with the children"" and I said no, if we meet, it won't be with the children at first until I know how our relationship is (important to note, this conversation didn't happen directly, boyfriend was the middle man). She started screaming at bf about how she needed to meet my children, too. She continued fixating about accessing my children, so I called it off. She had since stopped fixating about my kids, but it's going to take a while before I trust that she's let it go. I honestly think she doesn't actually care about accessing my kids, I think she was looking for a boundary to cross, and didn't expect that I would be open to meeting her, so she pushed it until she found the boundary, then pitched a tantrum at being told no. Hey previous behavior supports my boundary theory. 

I know she says horrible things about me to the her kids. I've seen messages she sent to bf where she calls me things like a whore, a home wrecker, scheming bitch, etc. My bf had been separated from her for a while before we started dating, I do not get involved with married men. She tells them I am trying to replace her and remove her from their lives, and I most definitely am not. 

She has been physically violent towards him before and after their split. She tells him the kids hate me, but I've worked in ECE for a decade, and I don't see anything in their body language to indicate that, and they beg to come to my house at least once a week. His oldest will often text me to arrange times to hang out with my oldest, completely unprompted. 

When will this behavior die down, or will it escalate? I have a lot of sympathy for her, and know this condition is hell, but I didn't understand what I was getting into, and I want to make sure my kids aren't in danger. I love my bf, but I have made it clear that if she shows up at my house or anywhere around my children, I will call the cops immediately before talking with her, and he agrees that is probably wise.

1kq7hpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kq7hpe/hi_guys_some_advice_needed_i_keep_dreaming_about/,"Hi guys! Some advice needed, I keep dreaming about my ex.","To add recent context, right now I'm in a relationship for the last 4 and a bit years, I love my boyfriend (although we do have our fair share of ""moments""), we work well together and we live in a different country together and I would say we are thriving.

Apologies in advance about the longs post.

Now historical context lol. I had met my ex through a friend, we had some normal moments, interactions passing each other on the street, in my workplace (I used to work in a coffee shop and he would come in alone from time to time) and he was totally my type but I didn't want to act on it, nor did I flirt, out of respect of my friend, until one day all three of us met up. From then on the flirting began on his side and I spoke to my friend about it and I was given the green light as he basically set us up. 

Now my ex was/is a decent person but at the time he had his own things going on and his own projects etc etc. When we first met up alone, we had a wonderful chat, he was gentlemanly and I was infatuated. From my perspective he did a lot of love bombing in the beginning as he ""seemed"" to align with the same morals I had and same hopeful future, convenient, right? Fast forward three months and he asked me to be his girlfriend and I was hesitant but said f@#k it, let's go. He seemed like the one I was looking for and I felt a lot of love for him. About a month in this new relationship, his attitude changed completely and he was more and more engrossed in his projects, distracted but I just didn't think there could have been anything malicious, as he was very passionate about this aspect and thought it was normal. 

He had dodged me here and there until finally I was like, let's talk and figure out what's going on bc something doesn't feel right. We met, he told me he had to come back to his country and broke up with me, 2 days later I see a video of him looking longingly into a girls eyes and eventually found out they were dating. Ok, case closed. But I always had this feeling that I never got proper closure as he had in fact not returned to his country and whatever other shitty excuse he gave me had been bullcrap. Whatever. I pulled up my bad bitch boots and started feeling myself again shortly after.

Zero contact from him for 3 years, a few likes on my posts here and there until I removed him and he would then like any post I was tagged in through people he knew. 

2.5 years into my new relationship and me and my partner had decided to move to another country and my ex all of a sudden tries to meet me while I'm with my friend and texts me out of the blue to talk and to apologise, I couldn't believe it. He also half heartadly apologies and said something along the lines of ""If I hurt you, I'm sorry"" making me think he didn't even remember what he did... He wasn't with his GF anymore, and I was having none of it. I wasn't interested and didn't respond. My BF knows about him and the situation, but he doesn't know about him trying to meet me and texting me as I decided (after speaking to some friends) that it wasn't worth the drama as we were moving away. now I'm PLAGUED with Dreams of him here and there where I dream about really nice moments and etc. It drives me crazy. I regret not telling my BF and maybe having met my ex or something to get proper closure so that I didn't wonder ""what if"" at times.. I am also an over thinker.. 

So without further adding information, I guess my need of advice is, did I do the wrong thing for not telling my BF about this sudden reach out and maybe having met my ex to hear him out? Has anyone ever been in a situation like this? 

It doesn't effect my current relationship but I'm sick of having these dreams. What can I do? 

I will more than likely delete this post in the future as this is a throwaway account but..I'm going crazy. I feel like I can't talk to my friends about it because they know what he did and how he acted with me.",1,1747647238.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I moved back to my old family home to focus. It was the kind of place where the silence pressed down around you, tucked deep in the woods and far from anything that could distract me. I figured it would be perfect place for finishing the textbook l'd been dragging my feet on, the quiet and isolation giving me the push I needed to finally get it done.

For the first couple of weeks, it worked. The house creaked in all the same ways I remembered from childhood, and if I ignored the dust and peeling wallpaper, it almost felt comforting.
Everything was fine until a familiar smell was permeating the air. It was faint at first, like a whisper of something on the edge of my senses.

A sweet smell but eggy a bit. It didn't smell rotten, exactly. It smelled... fresh. Like meat, raw and wet, hanging in the room.
It reminded me of my old butcher shop, where I'd spend hours surrounded by carcasses, cutting and cleaning until the smell of it worked its way into my skin. I actually never minded the smell. But this? This was different. There was no meat in my house...
I wrote it off as phantom smells, like that thing where your brain summons smells from your memory. I haven't butchered anything in a long time, certainly not recently and I was the only one at this house for over a year.

Parosmia‚ÄîMemory smells. I think it's called. But some part of me wasn't convinced, because the smell didn't fade. It got stronger.

I recalled of my days back at the butcher when I lived here, late nights, knives gleaming under fluorescent lights. I saw something caught in the meat‚Äîa tooth. Jagged.
Too big to be human, but not quite animal either.
Like a long-rotten fang, green and yellow with weird purple thin tendrils where the roots should be.

**

That night as I lay asleep, I dreamt of the butcher shop. This time it was littered with buckets of blood, bubbling over and spilling onto the floor. Purple tendrils were snaking out of the buckets, growing thick and veiny-ready to burst at any given moment.

And then a deep, loud rumble sound followed by squelching, and then I saw it, standing there staring at me. A tall, lanky figure as skinny as a baby, so tall its head was hitting the ceiling, dark sunken eyes, long fingers with claws at the end of them, wearing a red striped shirt with jeans and tattered sneakers. It was frantically trying to claw at me in desperation, shaking. But its arms were being weighed down by some mysterious weight, being kept at the height of its hips. The more it struggled, the more it made these jerky like movements that were so fast it was like someone clicked fast forward. Still unable to lift its clawed hands above its waist, it swayed back and forth, frustrated, and then behind me.

‚ÄîAnother squelching noise and bursting made me turn my head to see that there was its twin behind me. This one looked completely identical, except different clothes. It was also clawing at the air, its movements jerky, but when I turned back to the first one, it had gotten closer. Too close. I realized something then-if I didn't look at them, they could move. The second I turned away, they could get to me. I didn't have time to test it, though.

The rumbling got louder, when they spoke it sounded like nothing l've ever heard, like low and rumbling deep in their stomachs, an echoing voice, ‚ÄúMeat Mookie.‚Äù

I woke up gasping, drenched in sweat, but the voice didn't stop. ""Meat. Mookie."" It sounded like it was right there in the room with me.

**

It had been a long couple of days so far and I hadn't even started work. I figured maybe it would be a good distraction to all this craziness.

I could set up shop, brew some coffee, and pull an all-nighter and sleep during the morning and day. Surely my dreams would be friendlier during the day. At least that was my logic.

As I was walking back into the kitchen with my coffee mug, underneath the archway leading to the living room, I took note of the seam so as not trip over it like I always do.
Even with the smell hanging in the air all night I was able to get some work done and decided to call it quits at 3:45am. I was out like a light.

My eyes stirred open at the brightly lit room.
One eye made out two lanky figures hovering over me, I tried screaming but nothing came out. One eye could see them perfect, the other eye was in the real world with nothing there. As soon as they saw I was awake they started slashing away at me with their long fingers with bladed hands. The pain was excruciating. I begged and begged for them to stop until suddenly I got a burst of energy and bravery, almost like a feeling of being shocked by a defibrillator. In an angry growling voice I told them to fuck off and I jolted back into reality. I bolted upright searching the room for any sign of them. 

Nothing.

***

Later on the day it got weirder and this is what made me fear for my sanity.
As I crossed the archway being careful not to trip over the seam, I saw a slab of meat, perfectly the size of a forearm laying seamlessly against the wood. Like it was part of the house, I wouldn't have noticed it if I didn't always look at the floor under the archway.

I grabbed my keys and left immediately. I called a friend who lived locally and asked her to come stay with me to prove to me that the smell wasn't there and that this was all in my head.

She bugged me little about it, called me a city boy. I laughed it off and promised her l'd make her some cabbage rolls. The kind with tomato sauce that her grandma used to make. I could practically hear her beaming over the phone.

She said, ""If this is an excuse for you to finally see me then I guess l'll take it.""

When I arrived home the meat was gone-a part of me was relieved but the other part was sad for my mental health.

Sarah arrived at the house around 8 PM.
Cabbage rolls were ready. They were golden brown-they were perfect with just enough salt to enhance all the flavours. There's just something about salty cabbage, or is that just me?

Sarah, gave me a big hug, ""It‚Äôs been a long time, buddy, she glanced up at me and slowly backed away, wow you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ big‚Äîbigger, I mean larger,‚Äù her eyes were like cute round saucers. She still had the same style, her large flannel shirt hanging loosely over a regular shirt and some jeans. Kind of that classic little converse look, but older. I guess things move slow in small towns, I on the other hand was pretty ‚Äúclassy‚Äù compared to my former self, I didn‚Äôt own regular shirt anymore, just button ups and sure some flannel maybe. She smelled like coconuts. A welcoming smell in comparrison to what l've been smelling lately.

The evening went perfect and we were all caught up. Just as things were getting a little flirty after several glasses of wine each, I told her I had to go to the bathroom,
""Don't fall asleep on me now.""

She went to go sit on the couch, a small smirk playing on her lips. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúyou used to hate cabbage rolls. My grandma practically had to force-feed you.‚Äù

I laughed, shaking my head. ‚ÄúYeah, well, people change, Sarah. Clearly.‚Äù I looked down at myself playfully back. 

She tilted her head, studying me for a moment before adding, ‚ÄúYour brother would‚Äôve gotten a kick out of seeing you now. All grown up and‚Ä¶‚Äù She paused, her smirk softening. ‚ÄúHandsome.‚Äù A grin pulled at my lips. 

‚ÄúGuess it runs in the family, huh?‚Äù 

Sarah smiled and curled up on the couch underneath a blanket.

As I was washing my hands finishing up in the bathroom, I looked in the mirror, and I swear I could hear that rumbling again, the mirror was quaking ever so slightly, I leaned towards it for a better look as I swore it sounded like a tuning fork had been hit‚ÄîAnd that's when the smell started again, I nearly burst out the door to tell her,
""See! There‚Äôs a smell! Can you‚Äî‚Äù But no one was there, my heart sank. What have I done? I searched frantically yelling for her over and over. 

***

The officer leaned forward, pen tapping against the notepad. ""Alright, so what's your relationship to Sarah? Any history there? "" 

""Yeah... I mean, a long time ago, we had a thing. Nothing serious, though. Then-well, my brother came into the picture. "" The officer nearly scoffed and raised an eyebrow, 
I froze, realizing too late how that might sound. 

""Wait‚Äîno, no, it's not like that! I mean, yeah, l was upset back then, but that was years ago. I got over it. It's not‚ÄîI didn't...""
My voice trailed off as the officer's gaze grew sharper.

The officer leaned back slightly eyeing me suspiciously, ‚ÄúWell, Sarah‚Äôs pretty forgetful, right? She probably had to rush off for an emergency or something. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll come back for her phone later.‚Äù  

""Look,"" I said desperately, ""My brother... he passed away. After that, Sarah and I stayed friends. There's nothing weird or bad here, I swear, this was a lifetime ago.""
The officer, whose name tag read ""Ola,"" scribbled a few more notes before looking up at me. 

The officer leaned back slightly eyeing me suspiciously, ‚ÄúWell, Sarah‚Äôs pretty forgetful, right? She probably had to rush off for an emergency or something. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll come back for her phone later.‚Äù  

I laughed and shook my head, this is futile. Small town cops, what can I expect right? If anything did happen to her from his point of view I would be to blame. 

‚ÄúWell, I get why you‚Äôd be worried. It‚Äôs better to be safe than sorry, right? 

I tried to wrap things up with him so I could do my own searching. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt think Sarah would leave without saying anything. It‚Äôs not like  her.‚Äù I shot him a look, the kind that didn‚Äôt even need words to say, Are you serious?

""Alright,"" he said, his tone even but firm.
""Here's what we're gonna do. I'll send someone out to check around the area, see if anyone's spotted her. In the meantime, l'd like to take a look around your house-standard procedure, just to rule out anything we might've missed"". I nodded reluctantly. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have pushed him too much. I wanted to find Sarah as much as anyone, but the thought of the police poking around my house made me uneasy. I needed to fix this. It's just I had to report her missing to the police, it was the right thing to do.

***

I let Officer Ola in, I kept one ear on the officer's footsteps, but my mind was elsewhere. The tooth. I hadn't thought about it in years, but now, I wondered-could it still be in my old childhood room? Slipping away under the pretense of finding something, I headed down the hall and opened the closet in my room. I scanned the shelves and floor until I caught eye of something in the darkest corner at the top left. There it was. The tooth. But it wasn‚Äôt alone. 

Surrounding it was a black, goopy, sponge-like mess, tendrils extending out at unnatural angles and hooking into the tooth‚Äôs root. The air reeked of rot and decay, an almost sour scent that made me squeeze my eyes shut for a moment. 

The mass was unsettling‚Äîbig enough that a baby could crawl through it‚Äîand i couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it had something to do with the creatures. A portal, maybe.  

Whatever it was, I couldn‚Äôt just leave it there. I grabbed a socket wrench and carefully used it to pry the tooth from the mass. As it came loose, the tendrils recoiled, retreating into the tooth itself as though alive. I barely breathed as he carried the tooth to the bathroom sink, careful not to let the foul-smelling goo touch me. Once there, I rinsed it off, scrubbing it clean under the water. When the putrid smell finally faded, I held it up to the light, and for the first time in years, I touched it with my bare hand. 

Meanwhile, I could hear Officer Ola‚Äôs footsteps crunching in the backyard, oblivious to what I was doing. Thankful for the officer's distraction.

As soon as I touched the tooth with my bare hand, my vision become cloudy, and the world around me dissolved into a foggy, spinning haze. Everything blurred and churned, leaving me dazed and disoriented. 

The creatures began communicating with me in their strange, alien way‚Äînot with words, but through feelings, impressions, and flashes of shape and color that swirled in my mind. Their thoughts weren‚Äôt speech, but a kind of visual, gestured telepathy I could only barely comprehend.    Through this chaotic exchange, I began to finally understood their message. 

They were grateful for ‚ÄúThe meat,‚Äù and with a mounting sense of horror, I realized they meant Sarah. They explained that her flesh wasn‚Äôt just food‚Äîit was essential, acting as a key to bridge their dimension and mine. Without it, they couldn‚Äôt travel back and forth. But now, they admitted they didn‚Äôt simply need it; they wanted more. They liked the taste, savoring it and rationing it, and they planned to bring others of their kind through the portal. 

So they needed more resources‚Äîand they had decided I would be the one to help.    They reminded me that this connection between them wasn‚Äôt accidental. My mind watching, yanked to the day I‚Äôd found the tooth in the butcher shop, how I‚Äôd kept in my pocket, and how I‚Äôd unknowingly slept with it in my pocket at night, you see, I was out drinking with Sarah after work and passed out in bed immediately upon entering my room. 

So that night, while I‚Äôd been unconscious, the tendrils of the tooth had crept out, sinking into me and injecting their interdimensional energy into his very being. From that moment onward, I‚Äôve been tied to them, a telepathic link I had never understood until this point.    

My chest tightened as I processed their demands and the realization that Sarah was alive‚Äîbut only as long as I cooperated. If I refused, they wouldn‚Äôt waste time on me. They‚Äôd simply find someone else to fulfill their needs, which meant well... 

There was no threat, no malice in their tone. Just cold, calculated indifference. A very familiar feeling. 

I realized I had only one chance to stall for time while figuring out a way to save Sarah. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm going to help,‚Äù I said, projecting my thoughts carefully, ‚ÄúI need to understand your dimension. 

Let me see it‚Äîto learn how it works.‚Äù    

The creatures paused, then agreed, explaining that I was too large to pass through the portal as it currently existed. Instead, they planted instructions directly into my mind, vivid and searing. I felt the intricate details‚Äîan elaborate setup involving cameras, lasers, and bizarre configurations‚Äîburn into my memory. The complexity of it all was overwhelming, yet impossible to forget, as though it had been etched into the fabric of my thought.

I don‚Äôt even know how to describe how my head feels right now. Not only after what they planted in there but also‚ÄîIt‚Äôs like my once dull, predictable life has twisted into something surreal. Part of me feels a strange thrill I can‚Äôt ignore, but that‚Äôs buried under something heavier‚Äîfear. Fear for Sarah. I have to find her before it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôll keep you updated, feel free to doubt me. To think I‚Äôm crazy. But until I find her, none of that matters.  What would you guys do? ",2,1747647234.0,nosleep,1,0.75,False

Please help me build it out further.,"So, I've been a marketing strategist for years, and I've worked with SaaS companies like, well, many of yours. You know the feeling? You've spent weeks on a new feature, maybe painstakingly designing the UI in Figma, gotten your devs to build it, pushed it live with Vercel, and then you just sit there, hopefully praying users get it and don't just bounce. Or you're A/B testing landing page copy for your new pricing tier until your eyes glaze over, trying to figure out what actually converts.

That ""is this right?"" anxiety is what drove me to create AYA. I wasn't finding a tool available that allowed me, or the teams I was working with, to get fast, human-like feedback without having to order some gigantic, time-sucking research project or pay an arm and a leg that we didn't have at the time, especially early on.

Creating this thing on my own while still entrenched in my marketing day job. Let's just say my GitHub commit history over the past year likely resembles a Python-based cry for help at 3 AM, supported by dubious coffee and the utter horror of times when calling the feared¬†git push --force¬†command. There were countless times I was banging my head against the wall trying to get the AI personas to provide feedback that was more than fluff or struggling with cloud infrastructure to keep it cost-effective.

I longed for something that would be capable of telling me,¬†quickly, if my genius headline about 'synergistic hyper-growth through AI-powered paradigms' (we've all been there) was causing eye-rolls, or if that new onboarding flow was actually confusing¬†before¬†we lost a batch of new sign-ups. AYA uses AI-powered 'digital twins' ‚Äì think of them as extremely well-briefed virtual users for specific demographics ‚Äì to give you that qualitative gut-check inside a few minutes. Such as, ""Does our new¬†Slack¬†integration really sound useful the way we've explained it on the homepage?""

It's not meant to replace in-depth user interviews but more be super-quick,  inexpensive first line of defense against terrible assumptions.

And honestly, if you are keen to do more and give some detailed feedback, DM me I am more than happy to load you up with more.

1kq7glx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1kq7glx/what_i_learned_after_30_days_of_following_the/,What I Learned After 30 Days of Following The Lasting Change for My Habits & Mental Health,"I‚Äôve been in a weird headspace for the last year. On paper, things were fine‚Äîjob, relationship, apartment‚Äîbut my daily life felt like a mess. I was staying up too late, starting my mornings anxious, and constantly feeling like I wasn‚Äôt doing enough.

I came across a concept called *The Lasting Change*‚Äîa personalized wellness and habit system. I was skeptical at first, but I figured, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried worse.‚Äù So I signed up, got the book delivered, and started doing it daily.

Here‚Äôs what 30 days looked like:

**Week 1**:  
‚Äì Realized I was trying to build *too many* habits at once.  
‚Äì The system made me start with just one: a wind-down routine.  
‚Äì I resisted it. I failed twice. But I kept going.

**Week 2**:  
‚Äì A prompt in the book made me reflect on why I avoid silence before bed.  
‚Äì I started tracking when I feel most energized (and when I‚Äôm drained).  
‚Äì Insight: doomscrolling wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúrest‚Äù‚Äîit was avoidance.

**Week 3**:  
‚Äì Got a nudge to drink water as a *reward* instead of coffee as a rescue.  
‚Äì Slept 7 hours consistently for the first time in 4 months.  
‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I noticed my anxiety was lower just from that one shift.

**Week 4**:  
‚Äì Started layering in a new habit: no tech for 15 mins after waking up.  
‚Äì The habit tracker gave me a visual sense of progress without pressure.  
‚Äì On day 28, I journaled: ‚ÄúI feel more *me* again.‚Äù

What I liked about *The Lasting Change* is that it‚Äôs not just about ticking boxes. It‚Äôs like a personal guide that adjusts as you go. If I skipped a habit, it didn‚Äôt punish me‚Äîjust redirected me. It also included mood tracking and some questions that helped me understand what I *really* needed (not just what productivity gurus say I need).

So I built a tool. Early testers wanted!,"Been a marketing strategist for ages, and I‚Äôve lived the marketing life. You spend hours, maybe even days, crafting that ""perfect"" Instagram Reel, painstakingly editing a¬†CapCut¬†template, finding that trending audio (before it‚Äôs¬†too¬†trending), writing witty copy... only for it to get like, 12 views. Or you're in a back-and-forth with a client about whether a campaign hashtag for their new product (let's say, a sustainable coffee brand) is quirky-cool or just plain confusing for their target audience of, say, 'busy London commuters'. You need to know¬†before¬†you press ""post"" and it either bombs or goes viral for the wrong reasons.

That constant ""will this resonate?"" gamble is what drove me to build AYA (Ask Your Audience). I was desperate for a way to get quick, almost instant feedback on social content ideas, ad creatives, or even just a campaign angle, without the time and cost of traditional focus groups.

This has been a solo mission, born out of pure necessity. My first attempts at the 'digital twin' tech that powers AYA? Let's just say the feedback they gave was about as insightful as a Magic 8-Ball. It's been a massive learning curve ‚Äì diving into AI, understanding how LLMs (shoutout to anyone else who‚Äôs gone down the rabbit hole of how things like¬†Gemini¬†or¬†Claude¬†actually¬†work) can be trained for specific personas, and then trying to build an interface that‚Äôs not a total nightmare to use. All while juggling actual client work. The struggle has been real, folks.

With AYA, the idea is you can throw that Reel concept, that Facebook ad copy, or even just a campaign idea at AI-powered digital personas representing your specific audience (e.g., 'Gen Z¬†TikTok¬†users in New York who follow gaming influencers' or 'Millennial parents in Australia interested in organic baby products') and get a feel for their reaction in minutes. Is the tone right? Is it engaging? Is it cringey? Does it make them want to click/buy/learn more?

I'm at the stage where I need real SMM professionals to try it and tell me if it's genuinely useful or if I'm just talking to myself. You get¬†3 free tokens¬†to play around with when you sign up. And if you're up for really putting it through its paces and giving me the lowdown, DM me ‚Äì I‚Äôll sort you out with more. My goal is to make this a tool we can all actually rely on.

I was sceptical of the cost (luckily I had to go to Beijing and was able to buy these cheaper there on TaoBao). Yet I‚Äôve found them very useful in helping me get good results from the robot after months of flailing randomly. 

I don‚Äôt think they are essential and it‚Äôs possible to achieve the same with an analogue gauge and a scale that measures flow. But having the live visual chart in one screen and the record of past extractions (I use the Beanconqueror app) makes life so much easier for me. 

Trying to monitor multiple variables on the analogue gauge and the flow rate and weight on a scale simultaneously was just too much for me. I realise that‚Äôs not exactly necessary and once you get a feel, you can get good repeatability but for me I found this too difficult to keep in my head and remember from one shot to the next. 

The monitor and scale have also allowed me to try different pressure profiles taken from Decent Espresso posts for different roasts.

I discovered Heartstopper recently and rewatched it twice back to back. A few days ago, i decided to check out this sub and found out one of the team members was forced to disclose their sexuality after season 1 came out. I started digging deeper and felt horrible. Even after coming out i saw a couple of posts about alleged fans still questioning the outed person's sexuality. Now, i cant watch Heartstopper. 


(opinion on LGBTQ+ art from cishet) I watched Love, Victor a few months ago and quickly became my comfort show. The show had unnecessary amount of homophobia so i decided to watch fav moments on social media. Heartstopper filled the Love, Victor void in more ways i can ever imagine. The show addresses so many issues teenagers face in a perfect way without pretending phobia against LGBT doesn't affect LGBT folks. imo the show is perfect ( i skip the eating disorder episodes because it hits too close to home. 


Now, I can't watch the show without crying. I can't even bring myself to check out their social media page to see if they are okay. 


any thoughts on how to overcome this?

You keep showing up to anti-racist posts to shout about immigrants ""ruining the country."" We hear you. Loud and clear. So let‚Äôs try something different:

You want to be racist? Cool. Just don‚Äôt be *dumb* about it.

Let me help you out. **Because even hate deserves decent grammar and historical awareness.**

# üß† Lesson 1: ‚ÄúGo back to your country!‚Äù

Portugal is literally one of the most immigrant-exporting nations in Europe.

Over 2.6 million Portuguese live abroad. That‚Äôs nearly **25%** of the country.  
Ever heard of **France, Luxembourg, Canada, Switzerland, the USA, Brazil**? You‚Äôre in all of them.  
You made **TV shows**, **movies**, even entire **diaspora networks** around it.

So‚Ä¶ why is immigration okay when *you* do it, but terrifying when others come here?  
**Stupidity Level: 10/10**  
**Self-awareness Level: 0**

Let‚Äôs try basic economics and real history ‚Äî not WhatsApp group conspiracy theories.

# üßæ Portugal begged for a bailout in 2011

Yes, Portugal officially requested a ‚Ç¨78 billion bailout from the EU and IMF due to massive public debt, high unemployment, and banking collapse.

# üè† The Golden Visa & NHR schemes came after ‚Äî to attract money, not people

**Portugal was broke.** So the government launched policies to attract wealthy expats and investors:

* Golden Visa Program (2012): Residency in exchange for real estate investment
* NHR (Non-Habitual Resident) Tax Regime (2009, boosted post-2011): 10 years of low or no taxes for foreign retirees or professionals

While housing was ‚Äúcheaper,‚Äù most locals still couldn‚Äôt afford to buy ‚Äî so they rented or emigrated.

üìå Quick stat:

* Portugal‚Äôs real wage growth has been among the slowest in Western Europe for decades ‚Äî even before tourists or tech nomads.

# üîö Bottom Line:

Foreigners didn‚Äôt crash the housing market.  
Portugal‚Äôs own elite invited them in ‚Äî because they had already failed the working class.

# Foreigners didn‚Äôt take your houses. They took your government‚Äôs offer.

# Blame the system, not the Brazilian student renting a T1 with three roommates.

# ü™ô EXAMPLE: Portugal was so broke in 2011, it had to freeze pensions and slash salaries

After the **global financial crisis**, Portugal was in **deep economic recession**. To get the ‚Ç¨78B bailout from the EU/IMF, it agreed to:

* ‚ùå **Freeze pensions**
* ‚ùå **Cut public sector salaries up to 23%**
* ‚ùå **Raise VAT from 21% to 23%**
* ‚ùå **Fire thousands of teachers, healthcare workers, and civil servants**

Meanwhile, Airbnb **didn‚Äôt even exist in Portugal** yet.  
The Digital Nomad visa? Didn‚Äôt launch until **2022**.  
Foreigners were still mostly British retirees in the Algarve ‚Äî not buying T1s in Lisbon.

# üö® TL;DR:

By 2011, **Portugal was already broke and on life support.**  
The **working class was already underpaid, overtaxed, and losing public services.**  
Foreigners didn‚Äôt break the country ‚Äî the country was already broken, and **foreigners were brought in to patch the wound with money.**

# üß† Lesson 3: ‚ÄúImmigrants Take All the Jobs!‚Äù

Really? Then why are the only people doing them‚Ä¶ not you?

Let‚Äôs break this myth once and for all.

# üì¶ 1. Gig Economy? Mostly African, Indian, Brazilian, and Pakistani Men

* BOLT, Uber Eats, Glovo, Takeaway ‚Äî nearly every delivery driver in Lisbon or Porto is foreign-born.
* Most Portuguese youth think these jobs are ""humiliating"" or beneath them.
* Ask a local, and you'll often hear:""I'm not going to bike around like a slave in the rain.""

# üßπ 2. Hotels, Cleaning, Caf√©s? Foreign Women Keep It Running

* Lisbon‚Äôs hotels and hostels are cleaned by Brazilian, Moldovan, and Ukrainian women, not Portuguese.
* Many locals refuse these jobs unless they‚Äôre government contracted with benefits.
* Tourists are shocked when they hear no Portuguese in the hotel staff.

* SIC Not√≠cias ‚Äì ‚ÄúSetor da hotelaria depende de mulheres imigrantes‚Äù
* Expresso ‚Äì ‚ÄúAs mulheres invis√≠veis que limpam Lisboa‚Äù

# üë∑ 3. Construction and Kitchens? Eastern Europeans & Cape Verdeans

* Visit any site: Ukrainian, Romanian, Moldovan, Nepali, Cape Verdean workers.
* These jobs are hard, hot, physical, and low-paid ‚Äî and avoided by many locals.
* Instead, they stay unemployed or go live with family in Switzerland, France, or Luxembourg.

* Jornal de Neg√≥cios ‚Äì ‚ÄúSetor da constru√ß√£o depende de estrangeiros‚Äù

# üíº 4. The ""Government Job or Emigrate"" Mentality

* Many locals say they‚Äôre waiting for a ""concurso p√∫blico"" (government position) or studying for it ‚Äî for years.
* Or they plan to emigrate to Switzerland, France, or Luxembourg where ‚Äúthey pay better.‚Äù
* But somehow, they resent the foreigners working the exact jobs they think are beneath them.

Want to test this? Post a job for dishwashing at ‚Ç¨700/month.

# üß† Lesson 3: ‚ÄúImmigrants take all the jobs!‚Äù

Strange‚Ä¶ because half the jobs you‚Äôre mad about are ones *you don‚Äôt want.*

* Delivery guys? Mostly African, Indian, Pakistani, Brazilian men.
* Hotel cleaners? Ukrainian, Brazilian, Moldovan women.
* Chefs and construction? Eastern Europeans.

Meanwhile, you‚Äôre still ‚Äúwaiting for a government job‚Äù or planning to ‚Äúmove to Switzerland next year.‚Äù

Make it make sense.

# üß† Lesson 4: ‚ÄúWe have no culture left!‚Äù

Ah yes, the culture that thrives on welcoming tourists, foreigners, and‚Ä¶ fado sung in **Mouraria**, by people who are *literally* of North African descent.

Ever tried complaining to UNESCO?

# üß† Bonus Round: ‚ÄúChega is not racist!‚Äù

Bro‚Ä¶ their founder is a guy who literally said Portugal has ‚Äútoo many foreigners‚Äù and praised the **Estado Novo dictatorship**, which is when you were the poorest!

Chega means ‚Äúenough‚Äù ‚Äî maybe enough with rewriting history?

# So what‚Äôs the point of all this?

Racism isn‚Äôt just ugly. It‚Äôs **lazy**.  
You blame people who clean your streets, serve your coffee, and carry your food ‚Äî while ignoring the politicians and policies actually screwing you over.

You‚Äôre punching down, not up.  
And that‚Äôs not patriotism.  
It‚Äôs cowardice.

# TL;DR:

If you're going to be racist ‚Äî at least bring *facts*.  
Until then, don‚Äôt act shocked when the world sees you as bitter, broke, and backward.

Because you‚Äôre not just wrong.  
You‚Äôre *boringly predictable*.

‚ù§Ô∏è Final Message: From One Human to Another

Let‚Äôs be real:  
Your political system **failed you**. Your politicians **lied to you**.  
You have **every right** to be angry.

Life in Portugal isn‚Äôt easy ‚Äî low wages, high rents, broken promises.  
You all deserve **happier**, **healthier**, and **richer lives**.  
Because deep down, this country is **beautiful**.  
And so are its people ‚Äî warm, welcoming, generous.

But please...  
**Don‚Äôt let racism ruin that beauty.**  
Don‚Äôt blame the wrong people.

Foreigners didn‚Äôt bankrupt your country ‚Äî **your own leaders did**.  
Expats, immigrants, and third-country nationals came here with **the same dreams you have** when you move to France, Switzerland, or Luxembourg:

>

Many of us **do the jobs you refuse**,  
**pay taxes**,  
**hire locals**,  
and yes ‚Äî in many ways ‚Äî **we helped save Portugal** after the crisis.

We‚Äôre not your enemy.  
We‚Äôre your neighbors.  
We want to see Portugal **thrive** ‚Äî because we live here too.

Show **compassion**, not hate.  
Be angry at the ones who **actually failed you** ‚Äî the ones in power who stole your future and sold you fear.

Because when you‚Äôre **angry**, **fragile**, and **misinformed**,  
that‚Äôs when politicians **manipulate you**,  
with distractions, with blame, with lies.

That‚Äôs what caused Portugal‚Äôs **collapse in the past**.  
Please ‚Äî **don‚Äôt repeat it**.

If you love your country, **protect its soul.**  
Not just the land ‚Äî but the people, *all* the people.

We believe in you.  
We fight for you.

A strange smile crossed her face. ""I don't drive anymore. Tony picks me up.""

The door closed. Through the window, I watched her walk across the dark parking lot to where a figure waited beside an old Camry. The man's face was in shadow, but his posture seemed wrong‚Äîtoo stiff.

As they drove away, a chill settled over me, colder than the Minnesota winter.

The hours until midnight crawled. I followed the rules mechanically‚Äîlocked the bathroom, unplugged coffee machines‚Äîpreparing. At 11:45, I checked the breaker box, familiarizing myself.

At 12:30, the phone rang‚Äîoff-schedule. I let it ring three times. ""Kwik Trip 483,"" I answered cautiously.

""Don't let them in."" Tony Gustafson's voice, hollow, distant. ""They'll trap us forever.""

""Tony? Where are you?""

""Between. We're all between."" His voice grew fainter. ""The door goes both ways, Finn. Don't‚Äî""

The line went dead.

At 1:15 AM, headlights swept the lot. Uncle Lars's truck. Three figures emerged‚ÄîLars, Sven, and Maggie, carrying a large canvas bag.

They entered. I nodded. ""Ready?""

Maggie's eyes darted to the cameras. ""Do it now.""

I hurried to the storage room and pulled the main breaker. Darkness. Emergency lights cast weak pools.

As my eyes adjusted, I saw Maggie and Sven moving swiftly toward the bathroom, Lars close behind. Thirty seconds. I restored power. Lights flickered, computers rebooted.

I returned to find the bathroom door ajar, voices murmuring. Approaching cautiously, I peered in.

The small space was transformed. Candles burned. Maggie drew a complex pattern on the floor with chalk, reciting words in a language I didn't recognize. Sven and Lars stood by, holding open an ancient book.

""Good, you're here,"" Maggie said without looking up. ""We need to begin.""

""Stand in the center,"" Maggie instructed, completing the symbols‚Äîconcentric circles, strange runes. ""We don't have much time.""

I hesitated. ""What exactly are we doing?""

""Sealing the breach,"" she replied, lighting another candle. ""The bathroom is built directly over the old cellar. The door between worlds is weakest here.""

The bathroom looked different. Walls pulsed subtly, breathing. The mirror reflected shadows that didn't match us.

""The entities crossed over gradually,"" Maggie continued, arranging small objects‚Äîstone, feather, water, burnt wood. ""First through dreams, then reflections. Eventually, physically, but only at certain times.""

""That's why the rules specify times,"" I realized. ""3:33 AM, 4:13 AM.""

""Exactly. Boundaries weaken at specific moments."" Maggie gestured for me to enter the circle. ""We need to perform the ritual exactly at 3:33.""

Sven checked his watch. ""Twenty minutes.""

I stepped carefully into the center. The pendant felt warm.

""What now?""

""We wait,"" Lars said, positioning himself by the door. ""And hope nothing interferes.""

Minutes ticked by in tense silence. Outside, the store was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet.

At 3:25 AM, the lights flickered. A low hum built in the walls, vibrating through the floor.

""They know,"" Maggie whispered, clutching her book. ""They're coming.""

The temperature dropped. My breath clouded. The mirror fogged, strange symbols appearing in condensation.

""Stand ready,"" Sven warned, pulling a knife. He pricked his finger, letting blood fall onto the chalk. ""Blood of the bereaved to bind the door.""

Maggie did the same. ""Blood of the seeker to find the way.""

Lars followed. ""Blood of the land to guard the threshold.""

They looked at me.

""Blood of the witness to seal the breach,"" Maggie prompted.

Sven handed me the knife. I pricked my finger, watching the crimson droplet fall. It sizzled, the chalk glowing red.

The hum intensified. The mirror cracked from edge to edge with a sound like breaking ice.

""It's starting,"" Maggie said, opening the book. ""When I begin, repeat the response after each line. Don't stop, no matter what you see or hear.""

I nodded, throat dry.

""3:32,"" Sven announced. ""Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two.""

At exactly 3:33 AM, Maggie began to recite words that sounded ancient‚Äîharsh consonants, flowing vowels that made my ears ache. After each phrase, she paused, and I repeated a response in the same language.

Walls trembled. Dust fell. The black water coalesced into a vaguely humanoid shape, reaching toward us.

""Keep going,"" Lars urged when I faltered.

Maggie's voice grew stronger, words tumbling faster. The chalk lines glowed‚Äîwhite, then blue, then deep purple. The air felt charged.

The water creature lunged but couldn't cross the glowing boundary. It shrieked in frustration.

""We close the path,"" Maggie intoned in English.

""We close the path,"" I repeated.

""We seal the door.""

""We seal the door.""

""By blood and word, by fire and stone.""

I echoed her, feeling a strange power building, pressure against my eardrums.

The bathroom door slammed shut, then burst open. Standing in the doorway was Jenny, but her face was wrong‚Äîeyes too wide, smile too stretched.

""Stop,"" she said, voice overlaid with others. ""You're making a terrible mistake.""

""Keep going,"" Sven growled. ""It's not her.""

""The spirits aren't your enemies,"" Jenny continued, stepping forward. ""They offer gifts. Knowledge. Power.""

""Ignore it,"" Lars said.

Maggie hadn't stopped. I forced myself to follow, repeating each phrase, words like sand in my mouth.

Jenny's form flickered, briefly showing something else beneath‚Äîtoo many joints, too many eyes.

""Your uncle knows the truth,"" she hissed, focus shifting to Lars. ""Tell them what really happened in the cellar, Lars Larson. Tell them what your grandfather took.""

Lars flinched but held his ground. ""Keep going!""

The chalk lines flared brighter. The black water creature wailed, dissolving.

Jenny's face contorted in rage. ""Fools! You'll trap them forever!""

""That's the point,"" Sven muttered.

""Not them,"" Jenny snarled, pointing at me. ""Them!""

Behind her, more figures appeared‚ÄîTony Gustafson, skin paper-white, eyes hollow. Beside him, a young man who looked so much like Sven he could only be Erik.

Maggie faltered, a small cry escaping her. ""Erik?""

""Mom,"" the figure said. ""Please stop. We can't come back if you close it.""

Sven stepped forward. ""It's not him. It's using his image.""

""It is me, Dad."" Erik's voice broke. ""I'm trapped between worlds. The ritual won't free us‚Äîit'll seal us away forever.""

Tears streamed down Maggie's face, but she continued, voice shaking. I repeated the words, each one a betrayal as I watched Erik's desperate expression.

""The final binding,"" Maggie said in English. ""Speak their names to banish them.""

""What names?"" I asked.

""The names of those taken. You must renounce them.""

I looked at the figures‚ÄîJenny, Tony, Erik, others stretching down the hallway.

""I renounce you,"" I began. ""Jenny.""

Her form flickered violently.

""Tony Gustafson.""

The black water creature shrieked.

""Erik Olson.""

""No!"" Maggie cried. ""Not my boy!""

Too late. The name hung in the air. Erik's figure dissolved like smoke.

""Mom,"" he whispered. ""I'm sorry.""

Maggie fell to her knees, sobbing. The ritual faltered.

The chalk lines dimmed. Pressure dropped.

""No,"" Sven barked. ""We have to finish it!""

Uncle Lars grabbed the book. ""I'll do it.""

As he began to recite, the figures rushed forward. The black water creature expanded, enveloping Jenny and Tony. They crossed the threshold into the bathroom.

""Stay in the circle!"" Lars shouted.

I stood frozen as the entity surged toward us. It hit the inner circle boundary and recoiled, hissing.

""The final words,"" Lars urged. ""Now!""

I stumbled through the closing phrases, voice breaking. The chalk circle blazed blue-white. Walls shook. Tiles cracked and fell.

""By our will, by our blood, the door is closed!""

A concussive wave erupted, throwing everyone backward. I slammed against the wall, pain exploding in my shoulder. Blackness.

When I came to, the bathroom was in ruins. Mirror shattered. Sink hung at an angle, water spraying. Chalk markings gone.

Sven helped Maggie up. Lars lay near the toilet, a gash bleeding.

""Uncle Lars!"" I scrambled to him.

""I'm alright,"" he groaned, sitting up. ""Did it work?""

We looked around. The oppressive feeling vanished. Air felt normal.

""I think so,"" I said.

""No,"" Maggie whispered, staring at the floor. ""Look.""

In the center, where the circles had been, a small crack appeared in the tile. It widened slightly, a faint glow emanating from within.

""We weakened it,"" Sven said grimly. ""But didn't close it entirely.""

""Why not?"" I demanded. ""We did everything right.""

Maggie looked at Lars, her expression hardening. ""Because someone here doesn't want it closed.""

Lars avoided her gaze.

""What's she talking about?"" I asked him.

Before he could answer, store bells jingled. Someone entered.

""Who could that be?"" Sven whispered.

We crept out, soaked, battered. In the harsh fluorescent light stood Patricia, strangely calm.

""I was afraid of this,"" she said, surveying us. ""You tried to close it.""

""Patricia,"" I started. ""We can explain‚Äî""

""No need."" She walked forward, movements stiff. ""I've been expecting this since you first saw the woman in the red scarf.""

My blood ran cold. ""How did you know? I never told you who I saw.""

She smiled, the expression never reaching her eyes. ""Because she is me, of course.""

Patricia's form flickered, briefly revealing a gaunt figure in a crimson scarf before shifting back.

""You're one of them,"" I whispered.

""I am their voice in this world."" She looked at Lars. ""Just as your uncle was meant to be.""

All eyes turned to Lars, pale, shaking.

""What is she talking about?"" I demanded.

""Tell them, Lars,"" Patricia urged. ""Tell them what your grandfather really found in the Svenson cellar.""

Lars swallowed hard. ""A book. Like Maggie's, but older. And a key.""

""A key to what?"" Sven asked.

""To the door between worlds,"" Patricia answered. ""The Larson family were chosen as keepers. Your grandfather embraced this role, but your father rejected it.""

""And you?"" I asked my uncle.

Lars wouldn't meet my eyes. ""I didn't believe any of it. Not until you started working here.""

""He's been helping us,"" Patricia said, smiling coldly. ""Sending his own nephew to feed our hunger.""

Rage boiled inside me. ""Is that true? You sent me here knowing?""

""No!"" Lars protested. ""I gave you the pendant for protection. I tried to warn you!""

""Half-measures,"" Patricia scoffed. ""You knew the truth but lacked courage."" She turned to me. ""But you, Finn Larson, have proven worthy. You've seen us, survived. Spoken with us, maintained your mind.""

""What do you want?"" I asked, backing away.

""To take your rightful place as keeper of the door."" Patricia extended her hand. ""In exchange for the safe return of those taken.""

Behind her, the front doors opened. Jenny and Tony entered, followed by Erik and others‚Äîpale, moving with strange coordination, but unmistakably alive.

Maggie gasped, reaching toward her son. ""Erik?""

""They can come back,"" Patricia said. ""All of them. If you agree to maintain the balance. Not to close the door, but to guard it. Follow the rules, ensure others do too.""

""Don't listen,"" Sven warned. ""It's a trick.""

But Maggie was already moving toward Erik, face transformed by hope.

""Mom,"" Erik said, voice faint but his own. ""Please.""

Patricia turned to me, eyes gleaming. ""What will it be, Finn? Close the door forever and condemn these souls? Or become the new keeper, and save them all?""

I fingered the pendant, mind racing. The ritual failed, but we'd weakened the door. If I agreed, would I save them or damn myself?

""I need to think,"" I said.

""There's no time,"" Patricia replied. ""The door is unstable. Choose quickly, or lose everything.""

Behind her, Erik reached for his mother's hand. Their fingers touched. Maggie sobbed with relief.

""Finn, please,"" she begged. ""Save my boy.""

The weight of the decision pressed down. Close the door forever, or become its keeper?

In that moment, looking at the faces of those trapped, I made my choice.

""I'll do it,"" I said, words burning. ""I'll be the keeper.""

Patricia's smile widened. ""A wise decision.""

""Finn, no,"" Uncle Lars grabbed my arm. ""You don't understand.""

I jerked away. ""And whose fault is that? You knew.""

""Not everything,"" he insisted. ""Pieces. Stories I never believed.""

""Enough,"" Patricia cut in. ""The bargain is struck."" She extended her hand. ""Come.""

I hesitated, glancing at Maggie, clutching Erik's cold hand. Her face was torn.

""If I do this,"" I said to Patricia, ""everyone comes back? Jenny, Tony, Erik, all of them?""

""They return to this world, yes.""

""Fully? Not as.. whatever they are now?""

Patricia's expression flickered with amusement. ""They will live again. Different, perhaps, but alive.""

""And what does 'keeper' entail?""

""You maintain the balance. Follow the rules. Ensure others do as well."" She gestured around the store. ""This place was built as a crossing point. It requires management.""

""Management,"" I repeated flatly. ""Like a supernatural border patrol.""

""If you prefer that analogy, yes."" Her patience thinned. ""The door wants to open fully. The rules keep it from swinging too wide, too fast.""

I took a deep breath. ""And if I refuse?""

Patricia's face hardened. ""Then the door destabilizes completely. No more rules, no more boundaries."" She glanced at the returned people. ""And these souls remain trapped forever.""

Sven stepped forward. ""You're lying. The ritual was working.""

Patricia ignored him, focusing on me. ""Choose now, Finn Larson. Time is running out.""

The pendant grew hot enough to burn. I wrapped my fingers around it, feeling its power.

An idea struck me‚Äîdesperate, dangerous.

""I accept,"" I said, stepping toward Patricia. ""Show me what to do.""

Relief washed over Maggie. Uncle Lars looked devastated.

Patricia nodded. ""Follow me.""

She led me to the bathroom, others trailing. The room lay in ruins, water pooling. The crack had widened, glowing bluish.

""The first act of the keeper is to reestablish the boundary,"" Patricia explained. She withdrew a small object‚Äîa key, ancient, black metal. ""This belongs to your family line.""

""My grandfather's key,"" Lars whispered.

""The S√°mi pendant,"" I said, understanding. ""It's the same metal.""

Patricia nodded. ""Both forged beyond the door. One opens, one protects.""

She handed me the key. It felt heavy, thrumming.

""Place it in the center of the breach,"" she instructed.

I knelt by the crack, key in one hand, pendant clutched in the other. Everyone watched.

""Now,"" Patricia continued, ""recite the keeper's oath."" She began to speak in the ancient language.

I pretended to follow, mumbling nonsense, watching her. Her attention was fixed on the key, expression hungry.

In that moment, I made my real choice.

In one fluid motion, I yanked the pendant from my neck, wrapped its cord around the key, and slammed both into the crack.

""What are you doing?"" Patricia shrieked.

""Closing the door my way,"" I growled.

Pendant and key connected with a blinding flash of blue-white light. Energy surged. The building groaned.

Patricia lunged, disguise falling away, revealing the gaunt, twisted creature‚Äîwrong angles, too-long limbs. I scrambled back as elongated fingers grabbed for my throat.

""Finn!"" Uncle Lars tackled her, sending both crashing into the broken sink.

The crack widened explosively. A howling wind erupted, pulling at us.

""Everyone out!"" I yelled, grabbing Maggie's arm.

""Not without Erik!"" she cried.

I looked back. Erik and the others stood motionless, forms wavering.

""Mom,"" Erik said, voice clearer. ""It's okay. We need to go back through.""

""No!"" Maggie fought.

Sven grabbed her other arm. ""Maggie, we have to go!""

Patricia had thrown Lars aside, now stood at the chasm's edge, form elongating, stretching toward the light below. ""You fool!"" she howled. ""You've destabilized everything!""

Emergency lights flashed as main power failed. Through the doorway, products flew off shelves, windows shattered.

""Get out now!"" Lars bellowed, blood streaming.

We dragged Maggie from the bathroom as the floor gave way. Erik and the others remained still, forms growing transparent.

""I love you,"" Erik called, voice fading. ""I'm sorry.""

Patricia let out an inhuman wail as her body stretched, twisted, pulled downward. ""You cannot close it forever! We will find another way!""

The roof above the bathroom collapsed with a deafening crash. Dust and debris filled the air. We stumbled toward the front.

""The rules!"" Patricia's voice echoed, distorted, fading. ""Without the rules, the balance fails! You've doomed both worlds!""

We burst through the front doors into the cold night. Behind us, the Kwik Trip shuddered. Walls buckled, windows exploded.

""Get to the truck!"" Lars shouted, pushing us.

We barely reached his pickup when the building imploded with a roar. The ground collapsed, taking the structure down into a gaping sinkhole.

A final pulse of blue light shot upward, piercing the sky before dissipating.

Silence. Broken only by distant sirens.

We stood in shock, staring at the smoking crater.

Maggie fell to her knees, sobbing. Sven knelt beside her, arms around her, tears carving tracks through dust.

Uncle Lars approached, limping. ""What did you do?""

""I combined the pendant and the key,"" I explained, struggling to breathe. ""One opens, one protects. Together, I thought they might.""

""Cancel each other out,"" he finished. ""Or create something new.""

""Did it work?"" I asked. ""Is the door closed?""

Lars looked back at the destruction. ""I think so. It feels.. different now.""

""Different how?""

""Lighter."" He touched his chest. ""Like something pressing down has lifted.""

In the distance, emergency vehicles approached.

""What do we tell them?"" I asked.

""Gas leak,"" Lars replied. ""Believable enough with the evidence gone.""

""And the people? Erik? Tony? Jenny?""

His face fell. ""I don't know, Finn. I truly don't.""

We watched fire trucks, police cars arrive. Officials shouted orders. One spotted us.

""Anyone hurt?"" the officer asked, taking in our appearance.

""We're okay,"" Lars answered. ""Just driving by.""

The officer nodded, skeptical but with bigger concerns. ""Stay here. Statements soon.""

As he rushed back, I noticed something odd about the crater. No broken pipes, no water spraying.

""The sink was broken,"" I whispered to Lars. ""Water everywhere. Where did it go?""

He stared. ""Maybe when the floor collapsed.""

""No,"" I shook my head. ""No debris. No merchandise. Nothing but a hole.""

The realization hit us.

""It didn't collapse,"" Lars murmured. ""It went through.""

""The whole building?""

""Everything inside it.""

Including the people. Erik. Tony. Jenny. Patricia.

An EMT approached. ""Hospital?""

""We're fine,"" Lars assured him. ""Just shaken.""

""Still, protocol‚Äî""

""My sister-in-law is having a panic attack,"" Lars interrupted, gesturing to Maggie. ""Help her first?""

As the EMT hurried to Maggie, Lars pulled me away.

""The pendant and key,"" he said quietly. ""They weren't destroyed. They went through with everything else.""

""Does that matter?""

""I don't know."" His eyes were troubled. ""But if they crossed over.""

""Someone on the other side could use them,"" I realized. ""To open the door again.""

""Possibly.""

""So this isn't over.""

Lars shook his head slowly. ""I don't think so. But whatever happens next won't be here. Not at this spot.""

I looked back at the crater, trying to imagine where everything went. A backwards Kwik Trip? Were Erik and the others still trapped?

""Your grandfather,"" I said. ""In the stories, what happened after he found the key?""

Lars hesitated. ""He.. changed. Began to see things others couldn't. Places others couldn't go.""

""Like what?""

""Doors. Everywhere. Ordinary doors that led to extraordinary places."" Lars looked at me intently. ""Finn, have you noticed anything strange since you used the pendant?""

Now that he mentioned it, I had seen something odd. The empty hole seemed to shimmer, revealing an inverted gas station, lights glowing from underneath.

""Maybe,"" I admitted. ""Not sure.""

A police officer approached for statements. For an hour, we repeated our fabricated story. Authorities accepted the sinkhole theory.

By dawn, we were allowed to leave. Sven and Maggie followed us to Lars's house, too shaken to be alone.

Pulling into the driveway, I noticed something unusual on the porch‚Äîa small cardboard box.

""Stay in the car,"" Lars ordered, approaching cautiously.

He examined it without touching, then called me over. ""It's addressed to you.""

My name was written on top in neat script. No return address.

""Should I open it?"" I asked.

Lars nodded grimly. ""I think you have to.""

Inside, nestled in crumpled newspaper, lay a single item: a red scarf.

Beneath it, a handwritten note: ""Rules can be rewritten. We'll be seeing you, Keeper.""

The red scarf felt wrong‚Äîordinary fabric, extraordinary weight. Uncle Lars insisted we burn it. We watched it curl and blacken, yet I couldn't shake the feeling destroying it accomplished nothing.

In the days that followed, Hallock attempted normalcy. The Kwik Trip incident dominated news, authorities settling on a sinkhole explanation. Plans to rebuild were underway.

I attended Erik Olson's memorial. His body never found. The church was packed. Maggie stood stoic beside Sven. When she saw me, a shared understanding passed between us.

""He's not gone,"" she whispered. ""Just somewhere else now.""

I nodded, hoping she was right.

A week later, I sat with Uncle Lars, discussing my future.

""Offer for construction up in Grand Forks,"" I told him. ""Decent pay.""

""You're leaving then.""

""I need to. Every time I drive past that empty lot.""

""I understand."" He toyed with his bottle. ""But Finn, you should know.. what happened, what you did with the pendant and key‚Äîit marked you.""

""What do you mean?""

""The note called you 'Keeper.' That means something."" His eyes were grave. ""They don't give up easily.""

""The door is closed,"" I insisted. ""The building's gone.""

""Doors can be rebuilt,"" he countered. ""Especially when the key and pendant crossed over.""

I rubbed my temples, a headache building. ""So what do I do? Guard an empty lot?""

Lars shook his head. ""No. But be vigilant. Watch for signs. And if you ever see another list of rules.""

""Run the other way,"" I finished.

""Exactly.""

That night, I dreamed of Erik Olson. We stood in a version of Kwik Trip #483‚Äîfamiliar, wrong. Colors inverted, angles askew. Air hummed.

""You shouldn't be here,"" Erik said, form more solid.

""Where is here?"" I asked, looking around the twisted store.

""The space between. The halfway place."" He gestured to the walls, breathing slightly. ""It exists alongside your world, touching at certain points.""

""Like the gas station.""

He nodded. ""Places built on thresholds. Crossroads. Borders.""

""Are you.. okay?"" I asked awkwardly.

A smile ghosted across his face. ""I'm something. Not alive, not dead. But I exist.""

""And the others? Jenny? Tony?""

""Here too. We all serve the purpose.""

""What purpose?""

Erik's expression darkened. ""You'll find out soon enough. She's not finished with you.""

""Patricia? Red scarf woman?""

""She has many names. Many faces."" He glanced nervously over his shoulder. ""I shouldn't be talking to you. They'll know.""

""Who's 'they'?""

""The Travelers. The ones who walk between."" He began to fade. ""Be careful of doors, Finn. All doors.""

I woke with a jolt, heart racing. Sunlight streamed through the window, but the dream felt more real. I could still smell the inverted Kwik Trip‚Äîozone, wet earth.

Downstairs, Uncle Lars was up. He took one look at my face.

""You saw something.""

I nodded, describing the dream. He listened, expression troubled.

""It's starting,"" he said. ""Just like with my grandfather.""

""What happened to him?""

Lars sighed. ""After he found the key, visions. Sleepwalking. Found him in strange places‚Äîold wells, abandoned houses, once in Lake of the Woods at night, miles from shore.""

""How?""

""Claimed he used doors. Regular doors connecting to other places."" Lars poured coffee, hands shaking. ""Eventually, disappeared. Left a note saying he'd found the 'right door' and was going through.""

""Never saw him again?""

""Not in this world."" He met my eyes. ""But I think you just did, in your dream.""

Ice shot through my veins. ""Your grandfather was one of them?""

""Maybe. Or became something else."" Lars pushed a mug toward me. ""Point is, this isn't over for you.""

I drove to Grand Forks that afternoon. The city felt reassuringly normal.

The apartment was small, clean, on the third floor. As the landlord showed me around, I felt myself relaxing. This could work. A fresh start.

""So what do you think?"" the landlord asked.

""I'll take it,"" I said. ""When can I move in?""

""End of the week? First and last month's rent.""

We shook hands. I wrote a check, feeling oddly optimistic. Maybe Lars was paranoid. Maybe the nightmare was over.

On my drive back, I stopped at a diner. Nearly empty. Trucker, elderly couple. I sat at the far end.

Waiting for coffee, I noticed something strange about the restroom door. It seemed to shimmer, wood grain shifting. I blinked. It disappeared.

Imagination. Had to be.

The waitress returned. As she set down the plate, I saw her name tag: Patricia.

My blood went cold.

""Something wrong, honey?"" she asked, voice nothing like the Patricia I knew.

""No, sorry. Just tired."" I forced a smile.

She nodded. ""Long drive?""

""Not too bad. Heading back to Hallock.""

""Hallock?"" She frowned. ""Gas station collapsed? Terrible business.""

""Yeah, I was there.""

Eyebrows shot up. ""No kidding? Lucky to be alive.""

""Guess so.""

She refilled my coffee. ""Enjoy your pie. Holler if you need anything.""

As she walked away, my heartbeat returned to normal. Coincidence. Patricia was common.

I ate quickly, eager to leave. Finished, left cash, headed for the exit. Passing the restroom, the door shimmered again‚Äîmore noticeably. Wood grain swirled like water, forming patterns.

Despite every instinct screaming, I was drawn toward it. My hand reached for the knob.

The door swung open to reveal not a bathroom, but a long, dimly lit hallway that couldn't possibly fit. Walls lined with doors‚Äîdozens, stretching into darkness.

I stumbled backward, slamming the door shut. No one noticed. Trucker ate. Couple chatted.

I hurried outside, hands shaking. Dropped my keys twice. Slid behind the wheel. Movement in my rearview mirror.

The waitress‚ÄîPatricia‚Äîstood in the doorway, watching. As our eyes met in the mirror, her face rippled, briefly revealing another face beneath‚Äîgaunt, too-wide eyes, familiar hungry expression.

I peeled out of the parking lot, heart hammering. It wasn't over. Never would be.

Back in Hallock, I packed frantically. Uncle Lars watched from the doorway, grim.

""You saw something.""

""Doors,"" I confirmed, stuffing clothes into my duffel bag. ""And her. Patricia. Whatever she is.""

He nodded, unsurprised. ""Where will you go?""

""I don't know. Somewhere far. Canada, maybe.""

""It won't matter,"" he said quietly. ""Distance means nothing. They'll find you through the doors.""

I paused, a shirt half-folded. ""Then what?""

""Learn to control it."" He sat on the bed. ""My grandfather wrote journals before he disappeared. Notes about the doors, how to find them, how to choose where they lead.""

""You have these journals?""

""Some. Others lost."" He met my eyes. ""But I think you might be able to find them.""

""How?""

""Through the doors. If you can learn to navigate them, control which ones you open."" He trailed off. ""You could find answers. Maybe even find a way to truly close the breach.""

""Or I could disappear like your grandfather.""

""That's the risk."" He didn't sugarcoat it. ""But running won't save you. They've marked you as Keeper. They'll keep finding you, testing you.""

I sank down beside him, exhausted. ""I never asked for this.""

""None of us did."" He patted my shoulder. ""But here we are.""

That night, I dreamed of doors‚Äîhundreds, thousands, stretching through infinite gray fog. Some ornate, carved. Others simple, wooden, familiar. One by one, they opened as I passed, revealing glimpses of other places, other times.

Erik stood beside me in the fog, more substantial.

""You're beginning to see,"" he said. ""The spaces between.""

""I don't want to see.""

""Too late."" He gestured at the endless doors. ""You crossed the threshold when you combined the key and pendant. Now you're part of the system.""

""What system?""

""The balance."" His expression sympathetic. ""Every door must have a keeper. Someone to decide who passes through and when.""

""And that's me now?""

""By your own choice, yes.""

I shook my head. ""I was trying to close the door permanently.""

""No door stays closed forever,"" Erik said. ""Rules can be broken, changed, rewritten. But not eliminated.""

""So what happens now?""

Erik pointed to a simple wooden door standing alone. Looked like my uncle's spare bedroom door.

""Now you choose. Stay in your world and wait for them. Or step through and learn to control the doors yourself.""

""What's on the other side?""

""I don't know."" He began to fade. ""That's the nature of doors, Finn. You never know until you open them.""

I woke at dawn, dream vivid. Bedroom door stood slightly ajar. I was certain I'd closed it.

As I watched, it swung open wider, revealing not the hallway, but a long, fog-shrouded corridor lined with doors.

I sat frozen, heart pounding. Not a dream. The door to my room had become a gateway.

Footsteps echoed‚Äîslow, measured, approaching. A figure emerged from the fog, tall, thin, wearing a red scarf trailing behind.

""Hello, Keeper,"" Patricia said, voice reverberating strangely. ""Ready for your first lesson?""

The bell above the door chimes as I lock up Kwik Trip #483. Six months on the job. No one questions why I'm the only graveyard shift employee. Some raise eyebrows at the covered mirrors. Others wonder about the chalk symbols on the threshold.

Small town folks are practical. Coffee's hot, gas pumps work‚Äîthey don't dig deep.

I finish my closing checklist‚Äîfar more complex than the corporate version. Checking the storage room lock for scratch marks, listening for whispers in the dairy cooler, measuring shadow angles in aisle three.

Just as I complete the final task, my phone buzzes. Text from Maggie Olson: ""Anything tonight?""

""Nothing unusual,"" I reply. ""How's Erik?""

She sends a photo‚ÄîErik sitting at their kitchen table, pale but smiling. Getting him back wasn't easy. Required sacrifices, bargains with entities in the spaces between. But he's home now, even if he stares at ordinary doors for hours, or speaks in languages that never existed here.

The store feels different after hours‚Äîalive in ways that defy explanation. Coolers hum in harmonies too perfect. Shadows move against light. The bathroom door occasionally knocks from the inside, gentle but persistent.

I hang up my name badge and retrieve a different one. This one simply reads ""Keeper"" in flowing script that changes color.

""Ready?"" Patricia asks, materializing beside the coffee counter. Her red scarf is the only vibrant thing about her‚Äîthe rest slightly transparent.

I nod, pulling a ring of peculiar keys from my pocket. ""Which ones tonight?""

""Four breaches. Fargo, Bemidji. Two more up north, near the Canadian border."" She consults a ledger that wasn't there a moment ago. ""Northern ones are troublesome. Something large trying to squeeze through.""

I select a key of dark metal, too cold against my skin. ""Let's start there.""

We approach the bathroom door‚Äîthe primary portal. Rules are strict: specific times, specific words. I've learned the hard way what happens when they're broken.

The lock clicks open to reveal not the bathroom, but a swirling corridor of mist and floating doorways. My domain now‚Äîthe space between worlds I'm tasked with maintaining.

Uncle Lars visits sometimes, bringing journals from his grandfather‚Äîprevious Keeper before he ventured too deep. Knowledge helps, but some lessons are only learned through experience.

Like navigating the floating doors. Sensing which lead to safety, which open onto hungry voids. Speaking with entities without losing pieces of yourself.

A chill breeze flows from the corridor, carrying whispers. Patricia steps through first, form becoming more substantial. I follow, weight of responsibility settling.

The door swings shut behind us, sealing off the gas station. To customers tomorrow, nothing will seem amiss. Night manager restocked, cleaned, updated prices‚Äînormal tasks.

They'll never know I spent the darkest hours walking between realities, sealing breaches, negotiating with things that never knew sunlight. Won't see the residue clinging to my fingertips, or notice how I step over thresholds in a specific pattern.

And they certainly won't understand why I enforce the store's peculiar policies with rigid insistence. Why certain items can't be sold after midnight. Why the bathroom is always ""out of order"" during specific hours.

These rules aren't arbitrary‚Äîthey're the foundation of safety. Balance between worlds rests on these small, strange rituals.

It's not the life I would have chosen. But moving through the misty corridor toward the troublesome northern doorways, I realize it's the life I was always heading toward‚Äîstanding at the threshold, keeping watch, making sure what belongs on the other side stays there.

Everyone has their purpose. Mine just happens to exist between worlds.",2,1747645824.0,Ruleshorror,1,1.0,False

The drive‚Äîlong, dull, endless‚Äîfeels worse than usual. The road stretches ahead, swallowed by the darkness, only reaching as far as my headlights can push it.

Four more miles.
Thank God.

A red light appears at the next intersection. I ease to a stop. The streetlamps buzz, loud and erratic, like a swarm of invisible insects. Maybe it‚Äôs just my nerves. It‚Äôs been a cold, wet June. No sign of summer. No sign of anything, really.

Green.
The light changes fast‚Äîtoo fast. The sudden glow jerks my hands back to the wheel. Everything feels louder, sharper, heavier when you‚Äôre by yourself.

I drive on.
Same route I‚Äôve taken more times than I can count. Every slight bend, every pothole is etched into my bones. My car knows the road better than I do.

I‚Äôm exhausted. My eyes keep dipping, fluttering shut for a beat too long. The coffee I picked up earlier sits untouched in the cup holder. It‚Äôs probably cold by now‚ÄîI never drink it right away; it‚Äôs always scalding at first. Not that it helps. It never does.

Twelve miles of this. A straight shot. No turns. No signs. Just gray asphalt in a tunnel of trees and empty sky.

Almost there.

But something‚Äôs up ahead. A shape in the middle of the road. A dark object, centered perfectly in my lane, lit up like it‚Äôs waiting for me.

I slow down. Drift slightly into the next lane.

It‚Äôs a bicycle.
Silver and blue. A 10-speed, lying on its side. Undamaged. No scratches, no bent wheels, just sitting there like someone laid it down with care.

Weird.

The streetlights above it are all dead. Normally I hate how they buzz and flicker without end, but now, in their silence, the world feels hollow. Like it‚Äôs holding its breath.

‚ÄúPower outage,‚Äù I mutter. Happens.

I keep driving.

Drive.
Drive.
DRIVE.

They say you get used to a route after enough time. Muscle memory kicks in. You stop noticing things.

But this‚Äî

Green.

The same traffic light?
Wait.
What?

When did I stop?
When did I pull over?

I must‚Äôve fallen asleep. But‚Ä¶ how? I don‚Äôt remember stopping. I don‚Äôt remember anything.

Four more miles.
That‚Äôs what I said before. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying again.

I look down.

My coffee is steaming.
Fresh.
Hot.

I reach out, confused, cautious. I touch the cup.
It burns my fingers.

What the hell?

It‚Äôs the same cup. I know it is. The lid, the stain on the side, the same paper sleeve. But it feels like I just got it. Like time folded in on itself.

My stomach twists.

I check my watch. 9:47 PM. Frozen. Dead.

It‚Äôs been 9:47 forever.

The light is still green.

I shift into drive.

The car moves forward like it never stopped.

I know what‚Äôs coming.
Even before I see it.

There‚Äîin the road again. Same spot. Same shape.

The bicycle.
Silver and blue.
Pristine.
Untouched.

My headlights cast it in a too-familiar glow. My pulse climbs. A low throb behind my eyes. I don‚Äôt understand. I don‚Äôt remember driving in circles, but nothing has changed. Nothing at all.

Except the streetlights are back on now. Too bright. They shine like interrogation lamps. Like spotlights aimed at a stage. Like I‚Äôm being watched.

I need to get home.

I keep repeating it.
Over and over.

The road keeps going, but it feels longer now. Endless.

I signal the turn to my lot.
The turn surprises me. For a moment, I forgot it was coming.

I pull in.
And stop.

There is nothing here.

No house. No porch light. No mailbox.

Just smooth, empty pavement stretching into the dark.

As if nothing ever existed here at all.
And maybe‚Ä¶
Maybe it didn‚Äôt.

1kq70jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1kq70jb/my_colleague_had_a_incident_during_a_business/,My colleague had a incident during a business dinner,"This story still makes me cry-laugh every time I think about it.

This happened on a business trip to Spain with my colleague ‚Äî we‚Äôll call him Mr. Brown. And trust me, that name‚Äôs gonna make a lot more sense soon üòÇ

So Mr. Brown is‚Ä¶ special. His entire diet is basically fried chicken, chips, coffee, and beer. That‚Äôs it. No real food, no greens, nothing. Just pure chaos fuel. Naturally, his stomach‚Äôs always a mess, and the man lives in bathrooms more than his own apartment üòÇ

Anyway, we finished a job onboard a ship, and the captain invited us out to a fancy dinner. Me, Mr. Brown, the project manager, the captain, and the chief engineer ‚Äî nice crowd, fancy place, expensive wine, the whole vibe.

Just as we‚Äôre about to order food, Mr. Brown leans over to me and whispers,  
‚ÄúBro... I need to go take a sh\*t. Cover for me if I‚Äôm gone too long.‚Äù  
I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúYeah yeah, I got you,‚Äù and he runs off.

Now, knowing this man, I knew we weren‚Äôt talking about a casual bathroom visit. He‚Äôs got what I call ""liquid urgency"" problems üíÄ

So I keep talking with the table, keeping it cool. 15 minutes pass. Then 20. Then he finally comes back‚Ä¶ and oh. my. god.  
The smell hits the table like a freight train full of diapers. Everyone starts making these weird faces, looking around like something died üò¨ But no one says anything directly.

And then Mr. Brown, dead serious, points at the kitchen and says:  
‚ÄúYou guys smell that? I think the food‚Äôs off. Maybe we should leave, just in case.‚Äù  
And he starts trying to get us to pay and bounce ‚Äî *fast*.

We all agree because, let‚Äôs be real, something was seriously wrong in the air. He rushes back to the hotel, changes clothes, and meets us later at a pub like nothing happened.

Then he tells me what actually went down in that fancy restaurant bathroom...

So he goes in, does his usual stomach explosion (sorry, no nice way to say that ), and then realizes‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs *no toilet paper.* None. It‚Äôs a super-fancy bathroom ‚Äî marble counters, perfume sprays, warm lighting, artsy soap, probably jazz playing softly in the background ‚Äî but no toilet paper in sight. Because it was hidden in some fancy drawer under the mirror. But he didn‚Äôt know that.

So what does my man do? He takes off his *white t-shirt* and uses it to wipe.

But wait‚Ä¶ it gets worse. Turns out it was one of *those* kinds of emergencies. His underwear didn‚Äôt survive the battle either. üíÄ

So now he‚Äôs standing in this expensive bathroom, holding a ‚Äúused‚Äù t-shirt *and* his dirty underwear. And there‚Äôs this tiny little window ‚Äî just big enough for a bad decision. So he throws them both out the window like a war criminal ditching evidence üòÇ

Then he zips up, puts on his jacket ‚Äî bare chest underneath ‚Äî and casually walks back to the table like nothing happened.  
Except... the wiping job clearly wasn‚Äôt very thorough üò© And when he sits down and gets a whiff of himself, *he* panics. And that‚Äôs when he blamed the kitchen.

I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing the whole night. The way he tried to play it cool while literally smelling like the crime scene‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll never forget it.

Putting myself out here again. Nothing has been serious lately. And I feel like I have so much feelings and love to give but not receiving anything in return.

I only crave for attention, affection, someone who shares the same outlook in life, someone who shares the same ideas of the future with. Idk, but is that too much to ask?

I turned 30 this year
I work in an office, in the field of sales and marketing
I am on the heavy side but I am working on it. I run every other day and I play tennis twice a week with my friends. I am actually trying to do better
I love to travel! In fact, I am traveling very soon

I love writing and reading poetry, although I have to say I haven't been doing a lot of reading and writing lately
Business has been keeping me busy, although sometimes I get a little lazy but really, am trying my best

I love watching movies, listening to music and hanging out in coffee shops, which is weird because I am not a coffee drinker.
I am very close to my family and extend family. My cousins and me are very close, we're basically siblings from another mother.

I live in a tropical country all my life so I appreciate the cold.
I've lived in a cold country for a few years and I really miss that.

I have a degree in journalism and communication and I speak 3 languages fluently. 

Sorry, I do not play online games. Or any of those PS3/4/5. I don't have that kind of console.

As for what I want... I only want someone who is loyal for me and who would only choose me over anything else. Someone who is willing to go through ups and downs in life, someone who will experience life with me.

I know I am not the most beautiful girl, but I can assure you that I have a pure heart. I have so much love to give, I just don't know who to give it to.

Now, I am in no rush. I would like to get to know each other first before anything else. I don't want to jump into a relationship just because.

If you have made it this far, please answer any of the questions below.

- If you would have any kind of pet, what would it be and what would you name it?
- If you could bring an old snack that you can no longer find in the stores, what would it be?
- If you can buy something tomorrow that you cannot afford today, what would that be?

I wish you would be willing to do voice call, video call or exchange photos at some point. When you feel comfortable of course.

My daily driver‚Äôs a 2021 Model 3 Long Range‚Äîdecent kit, but let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs not exactly a magic carpet over Britain‚Äôs moonscape roads. Top of my list was finding out if Tesla‚Äôs finally cracked the suspension game with this Juniper. The chap at the dealership, all earnest and polished, swears they‚Äôve sorted every last control niggle. Bold claim, mate, but let‚Äôs see if it holds up.

So, I took it for a spin along my commute, which is less a road and more a gauntlet of potholes and speed bumps that‚Äôd make a rally driver wince. In the Model 3, there‚Äôs this one set of humps I have to tiptoe over at 2 miles an hour, or it feels like the car‚Äôs going to spit out a wheel. The Juniper? I breezed over them at 10 miles an hour, and‚Äîget this‚Äîit was actually comfortable. Not just bearable, but properly comfy. I wouldn‚Äôt push it faster, mind; I‚Äôm not trying to launch it into low Earth orbit. But I was grinning like a kid who‚Äôs nicked the last biscuit. Seriously impressed.

Now, many have mentioned the Audi Q7, the poster child family SUV for plush suspension. I‚Äôm curious too‚Äîdoes it waft like the hype suggests? I might just book a test drive to find out, because that‚Äôs the benchmark, isn‚Äôt it? Coming from cars like my old Subaru Impreza and Golf GTI‚Äîboth stiff enough to make your spine audition for a percussion band‚ÄîI‚Äôm not exactly used to this level of cush. The Juniper‚Äôs got me rethinking what ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù means. In the Model 3, I‚Äôm playing pothole roulette, eyes darting, brain on overdrive to avoid bottoming out. But the Juniper? It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄúRelax, mate, I‚Äôve got this.‚Äù I could almost sip a coffee and not spill it.
That said, I‚Äôm not rushing to trade in the Model 3 just yet. I‚Äôll probably sit tight for three years, let the prices settle like a good pint. 

This Juniper feels like the Model Y we‚Äôve been waiting for‚Äîproperly sorted, at least on the suspension front. Now, have they fixed those infamous panel gaps or the iffy paint? Not a clue, didn‚Äôt get the magnifying glass out. But those niggles aside, I‚Äôm genuinely excited to see where Tesla takes the Model Y next. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs a bloody good step forward. Right, I‚Äôm off to dream about that Q7 test drive‚Äîstay tuned!",0,1747644906.0,TeslaUK,11,0.14,False

1kq6utn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Barcelona101/comments/1kq6utn/ultimate_1day_barcelona_itinerary_see_all_the/,Ultimate 1-Day Barcelona itinerary: See all the highlights (with metro tips & exact Timeline),"So you've only got ONE day in Barcelona? Don't panic! I've put together what I think is a killer one-day itinerary that hits the major highlights without completely exhausting you. This plan is perfect for:

* Cruise ship passengers with just a day in port
* People with a long layover at BCN airport
* Anyone passing through who wants a taste of the city before coming back someday for a proper visit (because trust me, you'll want to come back!)

I'm assuming you've got some unlimited travel pass Hola Barcelona or T-usual (smart move!) and are cool with using the metro and walking. Barcelona's transit system is super efficient, and many attractions are within walking distance of each other in certain areas.

# THE GAME PLAN:

**üï£ 8:00 - 9:00: Breakfast at La Boqueria Market**  
*Metro: L3 to Liceu*  
Start your day at this iconic market just off La Rambla. Grab some fresh fruit, pastries, and a proper Spanish coffee. The market opens at 8 AM and gets packed with tourists later, so early is best!

**üï£ 9:15 - 10:30: Stroll down La Rambla & Gothic Quarter**  
*Walking distance from La Boqueria*  
After breakfast, take a leisurely walk down Barcelona's famous boulevard La Rambla. Then dive into the maze-like Gothic Quarter with its narrow medieval streets. Don't miss the Barcelona Cathedral!

**üï£ 10:45 - 12:30: Sagrada Familia**  
*Metro: L2 or L5 to Sagrada Familia*  
You CANNOT miss Gaud√≠'s masterpiece. Seriously, it's mind-blowing even from the outside, but definitely worth going inside (Pro tip: Book tickets online in advance as it is not possible to buy them on-site). Allow at least 1.5 hours here.

**üï£ 12:45 - 14:00: Lunch in Eixample**  
Grab lunch near Sagrada Familia or along Passeig de Gr√†cia. Look for a ""Menu del D√≠a"" (fixed price lunch menu) for the best value.

**üï£ 14:15 - 15:30: Casa Batll√≥ or Casa Mil√†**  
*Metro: L3, L4, or L2 to Passeig de Gr√†cia*  
Choose one of these Gaud√≠ architectural wonders to explore. Both are on the same street (Passeig de Gr√†cia) and showcase Gaud√≠'s unique style. Casa Batll√≥ is more colorful and whimsical, while Casa Mil√† (La Pedrera) has an amazing rooftop. (I personally prefer Casa Batll√≥ as it's more interesting for the kids).

**üï£ 15:45 PM - 17:15: Park G√ºell**  
*Metro: L3 to Lesseps or Vallcarca (then \~15 min uphill walk)*  
Another Gaud√≠ masterpiece, this park offers amazing views of the city and his iconic colorful mosaic work. The monumental zone requires tickets (again, book in advance!) but the rest of the park is free to explore.

**üï£ 17:30 - 19:30: Beach & Sunset at Barceloneta**  
*Metro: L4 to Barceloneta*  
Time to relax! Head to Barceloneta Beach for some chill time by the Mediterranean. If your feet are killing you by now, this is the perfect place to rest while people-watching. As the sun starts to set, the beach vibe is magical.

**üï£ 19:45 PM - 21:30 PM: Dinner in El Born**  
*Walking distance from Barceloneta or Metro: L4 to Jaume I*  
This trendy neighborhood near the beach has countless tapas bars and restaurants. Get the full Spanish experience by dining late (by North American standards) and trying various tapas dishes.

**üï£ 21:45 PM - ??: Magic Fountain** (if it's operating)  
*Metro: L1 or L3 to Pla√ßa Espanya*  
If you still have energy AND it's a day when the fountain is running (usually Thursday-Sunday in season), head to the Magic Fountain of Montju√Øc for the light and music show. It's free and genuinely impressive. (But check the operating times in advance ‚Äì the fountain is out of order and shows should be back in the second half o 2025).

# A FEW TIPS:

* This schedule is really TIGHT! You won't see everything in depth, but you'll get a great overview.
* Pick your absolute must-sees from this list if something speaks to you more than others.
* The metro in Barcelona is super efficient, but sometimes walking or a quick taxi is faster for shorter distances.
* Have your phone charged! You'll want pics, especially of Gaud√≠'s works.
* Wear comfortable shoes‚Äîyou'll be walking a lot!
* Stay hydrated! Barcelona can get hot, especially in summer.
* Watch your belongings‚Äîlike any tourist city, pickpockets exist.

I woke up at 5:45 and got up at 6:15 to go get the train. Two trains home, including time on the platform with rain on me. Got home. Logged into work around 9. Barely took a lunch break, have eaten nothing bar about ten jatz crackers and two small coffees (optimal health) and logged off of work just before 8pm. Jumped in the shower. Now I‚Äôm in bed and it‚Äôs 8:31pm. I was craving a decent shower but I was worried he would wake up, plus I didn‚Äôt want one only to get into not fresh sheets. They‚Äôve been *slept* in less than a week, but been on the bed just over a week. But there‚Äôs something about getting into a bed that‚Äôs not been slept in for a couple nights that icks me out. I also therefore couldn‚Äôt moisturise because I hate moisturising my body when I get in week old sheets, I feel like I‚Äôm just marinating in grime. Idk why I think my bed is so grimey at the end of the week, I change my sheets weekly without fail, I shower before bed every single night, I don‚Äôt get back into bed during the day, I don‚Äôt touch my bed with outside clothes, my windows are open during the day for constant fresh air and they‚Äôre new sheets/only a few months old. But they still FEEL grimey. Or rather I feel grimey. Idk I just have a thing about it. Same with how I feel wildly disgusting not showering before I go to bed each night even on days I‚Äôve done next to nothing - I just hate feeling dirty I guess. Same with any hair past two days old it feels dirty even though it‚Äôs in theory okay but it FEELS wrong. Mum still always calls me the princess and the pea and honestly, I may just be. 

I listened to George Micheal‚Äôs strangest thing a lot today. I love it a lot. His voice sounds like him, but at times it makes me think of someone and I want to say that pet shop boys guy but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs who I‚Äôm actually thinking of. Okay well now I‚Äôve listened to rent twice since trying to work out who he sounds like in strangest thing. It‚Äôs not that song. But there‚Äôs something that sounds SO like it??? God this is frustrating. Tip of my tongue. Hm. Anyway I love strangest thing a lot. I actually forgot about it til today when it came on shuffle though. I‚Äôm sure you could interpret it plenty ways, but it seems like such a sad song. I think most people would interpret it that way, no? I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôm so dense when it comes to this sort of thing. I need my honey. Then again everyone interprets things differently based on your own mind, so, anyway. Anyway. I said anyway twice.

1kq6u16,https://www.reddit.com/r/SriLankaTravel/comments/1kq6u16/our_honest_report/,Our honest report,"We went to Sri Lanka in February and I thought of sharing my honest thoughts after talking to friends who are considering. We really liked our time in India, Thailand or Vietnam, and we feel like while other countries have ups and downs, Sri Lanka was a bit underwhelming.

Our route - with driver & car:

2 nights Dambulla - to visit Sigriya and the caves

1 night Kandy

1 night nuwara eliya

1 night Ella

3 nights on the coast

Hotels: this is probably the worst part. We were looking for upper/mid range hotels but were also open to more basic stuff especially in the hill country. For the price we paid - average 180 EUR a night - we are super disappointed. It seems like the hill country has either guesthouses or super expensive hotels (500+ a night) with no mid range. The hotels we stayed at were either overpriced guesthouses de facto, or pseudo 5 stars with bad food and bus tours.

We feel like the value for money is just off in this country. We had a driver so location wasn‚Äôt an issue at all - yet we still felt like we are paying a Venice premium for no real reason.

Food: most hotels serve the same curry set with no variety to have have every day in a row. In Ella / Kandy you don‚Äôt really have nice restaurants, but rather hookah shacks with pizza and burger. It was super disappointing to be in the second largest city and still have to eat mediocre hotel food.

On the coast it was a bit better, but still less infrastructure than we expected. We found one decent place called Citra which was fun, unfortunately not Sri Lankan food.

Transportation: the setup they have it really nice. Drivers charge around 60 usd per day and their accommodation is sorted too. It was a seamless experience.

Hill country: there is one route full of bus tours. You can see some waterfalls and some temples, but we felt like everything after sigriya and Dambulla was worth skipping. Especially Ella!

The tea plantations are nice, but again full of tour buses, no decent food, and it felt like a mock Douro valley.

Odyssey train: nice experience, it is enough to take a shorter segment like we did (nanuoya to Ella).

Yalla safari: we added this last minute because of bad weather on the coast. I think you can definitely skip: you drive with hundreds of other jeeps to see elephants and buffalos.

The coast: many surfer locations which again don‚Äôt offer infrastructure for those who want to have a nice dinner and drinks. The sea is dangerous to swim in in many parts, the coastline is blocked by buildings including high rise. And hotels are again overpriced and lack in quality.

Galle: we loved it, the only interesting town we saw and quite pleasant to walk around for some shopping or decent food / coffee (for a change).

Factoring in the high risk of bad weather even in the dry season, we felt like this is not the right choice. Not enough to see on one hand, and not enough infrastructure to chill on the other hand.",1,1747644444.0,SriLankaTravel,0,1.0,False

Like,¬†hit-snooze-five-times¬†bad. I‚Äôd read all the habit stuff‚Äî21 days, 66 days, whatever‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt clicking.

Enter my accountability coach, (found on Reddit). He wasn‚Äôt some drill sergeant; just this chill guy who texted me every morning: ‚ÄúYou up?‚Äù No judgment, just consistency.

1st Week?¬†Brutal. I dragged myself out of bed at 6 a.m., and half the time I lied about it‚Äî‚ÄúYep, totally awake!‚Äù while still under the covers.

By day 10, I was actually brewing coffee instead of faking it.

Week 3, I stopped needing his nudge most days‚Äîmy body just¬†knew.

Week 5, I was that annoying morning person texting him at sunrise.

How long did it take? For me, with Antonio, it was about 35 days to feel solid.  
Not the mythical 21, not quite the 66-day research stat‚Äîjust over a month of him keeping me honest.

The coach part didn‚Äôt magically rewire me; it forced me to show up when I‚Äôd usually flake.

Studies say 66 days is average, but with him, it was faster‚Äîprobably because I couldn‚Äôt BS my way out.

Point is, a coach shrinks the timeline if you lean into it.

Without him, I‚Äôd still be a snooze-button champ.

Maybe he has forgotten he had created something like this once, I mean "" The Station 13 "" .
I'm Amir, an Iranian writer working on my surreal philosophical novel The Station 13.
It‚Äôs a blend of dark mystery, metaphysical conversations, and psychological decay.
This monologue is from my favorite chapter:
Carl, covered in blood, meets a man called The Narrator at a train station ‚Äî a man who speaks in riddles, irony, and raw truth.

Here‚Äôs the scene. Let me know ‚Äî
Does it hit? Or is it just me and my madness?
We start now :

Novel : The Station 13 ( Written by Amirali Sayyah )
Chapter 2 : The fall and rise of Carl Walters

The Narrator left, so I‚Äôll be your voice here.
You know, you should get used to that.
Sorry I didn‚Äôt introduce myself.

Symbolic, isn‚Äôt it?
But hey, I didn‚Äôt write it ‚Äî I‚Äôm just reading what‚Äôs already there.
He sits on that bench and cries.
It‚Äôs past midnight.
No stars.
Even the stars were too afraid to watch Carl cry.

Suddenly, the air gets cold.
A man approaches from the distance, though you can‚Äôt see him clearly at first.
He gets closer, and now ‚Äî
Wait. That man‚Ä¶
Damn him.
Sorry, I shouldn‚Äôt say anything yet.
But really damn him. It isn't written in the script I have ! That's maybe why he left. But for what ? We will see.

He‚Äôs wearing a long gray coat and a matching gray hat.
Brown pants and shoes.
The hat‚Äôs pulled down just enough to hide his face,
but that bitter smile ‚Äî that you can see.

He sits next to Carl.
Takes out a cigarette from a pack and says:

""Want one?""

Carl doesn‚Äôt respond.
Just lowers his head to decline.

The man says:

""No cigarettes, no whiskey‚Ä¶ not even a proper curse unless Walter‚Äôs yelling in your ear.
Even when you want to make a decision, you only think for five minutes!
You‚Äôre amazing, Carl.""

Carl looks at him, shocked.

Carl: ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ how do you know all that? Tell me the truth!‚Äù
Narrator: ‚ÄúTruth is bitter. That‚Äôs why most people take their coffee with sugar‚Ä¶ and their lives with lies.‚Äù

""You know Carl, you and I‚Ä¶
we‚Äôre similar.
But maybe‚Ä¶
maybe it‚Äôs just fate that has a problem with us.""

Carl: ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ who are you?‚Äù
 
Narrator: Funk or Jazz ? Or maybe Pop ?

Carl : What ? just answer my ...

Narrator: Why you loved Amy ?

Carl : Who are you ? You goddamn....

Narrator: When was your first encounter with Walter ? 

Carl : What ? What do you ....

Narrator: Was Amy's face a reminder of your dead mother ?

Carl : Why you keep answering questions?

Narrator: at least a good question. And there is an answer . Just questions remain Carl. The answers? They get contradicted, they change, and then fade away in the mind of a madman. Why? Because of a new theory.



Narrator: ‚ÄúWho am I? That‚Äôs funny ‚Äî no one‚Äôs ever asked.‚Äù
Carl (angrily): ‚ÄúAnswer me!‚Äù
Narrator: ‚ÄúEasy, boy, easy.
You know‚Ä¶ I forgot who I used to be.
But now ‚Äî they call me The Narrator.
My friends call me that.
I tell stories.
Your story‚Ä¶ is different.‚Äù

Carl: ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ have friends?‚Äù
Narrator: ‚ÄúYeah.
A few concepts.
And the graves of people whose stories I‚Äôve already told.‚Äù

Carl lowers his head, afraid.
But asks another one : If you are The Narrator and you are here , who's telling the goddamn story ?
Narrator: Good question. That idiot author that has written just the plot of this story. I have written more than this guy. Isn't it right Mr. Sayyah ?
 
Carl looks at Narrator with a funny confused face

The Narrator speaks again:

""You know Carl, a coin has two sides ‚Äî
one is victory, the other is defeat.
Victory means life.
Defeat means death.""

He tosses a coin in the air ‚Äî but suddenly, it vanishes.

""You see, Carl‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt even bother to check how the coin lands.
But you ‚Äî
you really intrigue me.
Heads or tails?""

Carl: ‚ÄúThe coin doesn‚Äôt decide for me.‚Äù

Narrator: ‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll see.‚Äù

He tosses a coin ‚Äî and it lands upright.
Not heads. Not tails. Just‚Ä¶ standing.

Narrator: ‚ÄúWhere I come from, this doesn‚Äôt happen.
Strange‚Ä¶
You know, Carl, even Fate is doubting you now ‚Äî
even it has lost faith in you.
And I‚Ä¶
I love people who‚Äôve lost their faith.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou used to have this spark in your eyes, but now‚Ä¶‚Äù

The Narrator points to Carl‚Äôs blood-soaked clothes.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Now we‚Äôre here.‚Äù

He pulls out Amy‚Äôs white scarf ‚Äî now stained with blood.

Narrator: ‚ÄúJust five seconds.
That‚Äôs all it took, Carl.
Five seconds of distraction.‚Äù

Carl: ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶‚Äù

The Narrator laughs.

Narrator: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know what to say?
Yeah, sorry ‚Äî no dialogue was written for you here.‚Äù

Carl: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about dialogue.
I just want the truth.‚Äù

The Narrator pauses ‚Äî surprised.

Narrator: ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what did you just say?
You?
You never had anything to say.
You always surprise me.
But Let me tell you the truth from my perspective.
Truth is like an old lady shouting in the street.
But most people are listening to their favorite lie cassette tapes,
so they don‚Äôt pay her any attention.
Or even without that ‚Äî they just run from her.

She once asked me,
""Why did you keep chasing me?""
I said,
""Because everyone else is a lie.""
She said,
""And you?""
...I went silent.
Because it...
was a lie too.

She wrecked me beautifully.
But I can‚Äôt show it, right Carl?
Can‚Äôt let it show on my face.

Truth is ruthless.
Not out of cruelty ‚Äî
but out of pure, naked honesty that makes your bones shake.

She‚Äôs a mirror...
only the bad part is, her angle is never quite right.

But Carl,
a lot of people say they‚Äôre chasing her.
But most of them?
They‚Äôre just pretending for show.
Or if they do find her...
they have no clue what the hell to do with her.

So tell me, Carl...
Are you still chasing the truth?


Carl stays silent.

Narrator: ‚ÄúYou know Carl‚Ä¶
just five seconds.
You‚Äôve always had a problem with time.‚Äù

The Narrator stands up.
A train whistle sounds in the distance.
The train arrives.
And as smoke fills the air, the Narrator vanishes into it ‚Äî
but his voice remains:

‚ÄúWhatever you choose, Carl‚Ä¶
I‚Äôll be waiting.‚Äù

The train leaves.
And on the bench ‚Äî
there‚Äôs a red lighter,
a cigarette pack labeled ‚Äú5 Seconds,‚Äù
and a note:

‚ÄúYou know, Carl ‚Äî
numbers are fate.
But no one looks at them that way.
Light a cigarette.
It‚Äôs not a sin.
At least not for people like us ‚Äî
people who need to forget pain,
for just‚Ä¶ an hour.‚Äù

Carl looks at it and says:

‚ÄúDamn him.
He knew it all along.‚Äù

He lights a cigarette.

And yes ‚Äî you guessed it right.

That was The Narrator.

1kq6odk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kq6odk/i_found_my_husband_trying_to_cheat_a_few_weeks/,I found my husband trying to cheat a few weeks right after I gave birth to our son? 38M 35F,"I gave birth 4-5 weeks ago, and its been really hectic. I am exhausted and sleep deprived and hazy every morning, and after recently checking my husband's behaviour I have been even more stressed out and feel betrayed.

My husband has been spending way too much time outside the house nowadays. He does help in cleaning the house, prepares all the meals, but the time he spends with me or even the kid has been minimum to none. I had complications during labour and expected him to atleast show a bit of consideration and warmth, but instead he's just detached and doesn't even talk.

I asked him about him a few days ago, and his excuse was that I was spending too much time with the baby.  
Mind you that we had this baby after lot of failures, and last year we even had a miscarriage (I had fallen down from a very steep set of stairs and it was terrible)  
That time still haunts me and I want to make it up by spending as much as I can with my now baby son.

whenever I'm breast feeding he leaves the room and doesn't enter. He even tried to get me into watching some lame ass movie with him, it was nice that he set the bed and made my favourites but didn't want the baby to be with me. I told him that I was a mother now and had priorities and he went out of the room, saying nothing the next morning.  
A few days after that he ordered me a necklace and it was really pretty, but I didn't let him put it on me and he didn't talk much after that.

Recently a few of my friends had also come to visit, and they made a few jokes about him acting like a man-child when I told then about how he was acting.  
He got into a fight with me afterward. I admit that I had told him to sleep elsewhere rather than in our bedroom, I felt the need for space and it suffocated me at time to have another body touching me, especially when I feel extremely disgusted with how everything has changed.  
I told him that the baby needs me, and that I'm doing all I can. He isn't the one waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning the calm the baby, nor is he the one feeding the baby. I'm the one who went through all the pain and should be the one getting a bit of pampering but he doesn't do it anymore.

A week after birth, he was perfect. He brought me sweets, hugged me randomly, massaged me when I felt too drained and used to bring a small flower everyday. He does none of that anymore and its a sudden shift which I find odd and disturbing. He sat with me, made me laugh, said random stuff to the baby. He still brings stuff home, maybe a small toy or whatever groceries are required, but whenever he sees me with the baby he just turns and leaves.   
when the baby is alone though, he spends time with him, often initiating skin-to-skin contact, he's been obsessed since the doctors told him about it, and gets him to say small words. He adores his son, but he's stopped engaging much with me

I heard from one of our mutuals, who is my husbands co-worker too, that he had been seen laughing around a lot with one of his assistants around the coffee house nearby. She's pretty young and is good looking too.  
I told him that if he wanted to do all that he should just leave before it gets too messy, and retorts by saying I was too friendly with my ex when he congratulated my for my son and sent a few gifts. I had only talked to my ex for a while and let him come home to see the baby, my husband just cooked and went to sleep in the room.  
It bugs me how he didn't deny it or even defend himself, and is trying to take revenge on someone who literally gave birth to his own son.

However some drinks can aid in achieving your weight loss objectives in a healthy natural way. Warm lemon water is one of the few and most frequently mentioned beverages. 

Beginning the day with a pitcher of hot water combined with bubbly lemon juice may seem like too simple a start but it certainly has some clear benefits. Lemon water can first help hydrate you and stimulate your digestive system to start moving in the morning. Additionally it can aid in detoxification and hydration. Sometimes dehydration makes us feel hungry so drinking lemon water can help you avoid unnecessary nibbling. 

Lemon - also contains a trace amount of vitamin C 

which boosts your immune system and may improve your metabolism. Furthermore the lemon is more readily absorbed by your body because of the warm water. Regular intake especially before meals will make you feel satiated and naturally reduce your appetite without you giving it a second thought rather than burning fats on its own. 

Green tea - is yet another well liked beverage that helps people lose weight. This one has undergone extensive research and its benefits are supported by sound science. Green tea is packed with antioxidants especially one called EGCG that has been shown to aid in fat burning particularly when combined with exercise. Additionally it contains a modest quantity of caffeine which can help boost your metabolism and give you a little energy boost without giving you the jitters that a strong espresso may. 

Drinking green tea throughout the day has been shown to help curb hunger and keep cravings under control for many people. Just make sure to keep it simple and avoid adding too much cream or sugar to get the maximum benefit. 

Black espresso - can also aid in weight loss if consumed properly even if you don't prefer novice tea. Espresso contains caffeine which can help speed up your metabolism and increase your alertness while exercising. However it's important to remember that those elaborate espresso liquids loaded with sugar and syrup might actually have the opposite effect and cause you to gain weight. 

Apple cider vinegar (ACV) - is another beverage that has gained popularity in the weight loss community. Some people claim that drinking a tablespoon of ACV diluted in a pitcher of water before meals helps lower blood sugar levels curb appetite somewhat and aid digestion. However a word of caution never consume it undiluted as it is very acidic and can harm your teeth or stomach lining. Always dilute it in plenty of water. 

Furthermore sooner or later allow's no longer ignore the most underrated and potent beverage of all plain water. Maintaining an adequate daily intake of water might help lessen bloating keep your metabolism functioning properly and allow your body to function smoothly. You may find yourself eating less if you drink a tumbler of water before meals since it will make you feel fuller. It's such a straightforward practice yet it truly makes a difference. 

To summarize - none of those beverages will cause you to lose 10 pounds in a single day but they can aid in your weight reduction efforts if combined with a balanced diet regular exercise and adequate sleep. Consider plain water diluted apple cider vinegar lemon water green tea and (moderately) black coffee. Think of them as minor aids on your journey rather than rapid fixes as they are everyday habits that build up over time. 

Maintain consistency pay attention to your body and most importantly treat yourself well throughout the process.",1,1747643653.0,u_Deep_Illustrator_656,0,1.0,False

What's worrying me a little is that my doctors have mot really given me specific directions on what to do or not to do in the meantime.

Two weeks ago work wanted me to go to the ER because a ""dizzy spell"" (actually sudden, profound weakness and sometimes nausea/vomiting) left me incapacitated. This had happened once about 6 months before. The school nurse was concerned that my O2 was 95 and dropping, but it's usually on the low side; blood oxygen of 92 does not make me unable to stand.

They care about me and were worried, and I was a little worried, but I didn't think it was something they'd admit me for. But when I checked in at triage and had my finger in a pulse oximeter my pulse suddenly shot to 193 and everyone was obviously treating it as a real emergency. (Supraventrical tachycardia. Also something about v-fib, although I thought my heart was beating a normal rhythm, just fast). They eventually ""restarted"" my heart with adenosine. Also did a bunch of test,

EKGs, echocardiogram, an angiogram led to a months worth of appointments and procedures and hopefully in mid-June I'll have had the ablation and the valve replacement and (assuming it can be done by catheter) will be on the mend.

What worries me a little is nobody offers much advice about what I should or shouldn't be doing. I tried to get a note saying I could go back to work but he never sent it; it made me wonder ... did he think I shouldn't? But after being out several days and doing normal things I just came in and no one had time to run me off.

I get the feeling that anything or nothing can trigger this, that I've crossed into the territory where something could go seriously wrong at any second no matter what I'm doing. School its out in 3 days, I can essentially put myself on bedrest for the next month. In the meantime I'm trying to stay hydrated, stand up straighter, practice more effective breathing, get enough sleep, good food, don't get constipated, stay on an even keel, cut my coffee rations etc. So: Do I take it easy? Or just live life and not worry, as the attacks seem random? (However: They never occur when I'm \*at rest,\* as far as I know).

I catch myself saying that
like graffiti
on the walls of a life
we‚Äôre slowly dismantling
with love.

It‚Äôs more than downsizing.
It‚Äôs a soft demolition
of a world
that raised me.
A careful extraction
of memory from object
so my mother
can walk through the house
without stepping
on grief.

I write because this is how
we say goodbye
without breaking
everything.

It‚Äôs work.
Harder than grief, sometimes.
Softer, too.
Like tucking a child in
after a long day
of losing.

Brqqks & Mortar.
Not a business.
Not a brand.
Just a way
to give weight to what was,
and a little light
to what comes next.",1,1747643212.0,grittytruth,0,1.0,False
1kq6j2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/x_Bloom/comments/1kq6j2b/subscription_shipping_price_increase/,Subscription Shipping Price Increase?!?,"...so just received my unit not long ago and liking it; however, I went in to modify my initial subscription to swap out/add some different coffees and I noticed the shipping price of subscriptions increased astronomically.

I was just in there a few days ago and the shipping price was $5.95. In an effort to maximize value, I added a few more selections to my upcoming subscription order and shipping remained $5.95.

I login this morning to finalize my selections and, well, see below. **Talk about a deal breaker.** 

Can anyone else confirm that Xbloom is now charging nearly $16 shipping, even if you only have 8 tiny pods? (I had more, but thought perhaps they changed the price based on how many varieties I added, so scaled it back to see if the shipping price changed...nope.)

This is crazy talk. I'm out.

A myth, if you will.
One of mystery. Of misplaced laundry. Of a woman so powerful, so cosmically chaotic, that even the universe‚Äôs weirdest disappearing act couldn‚Äôt take her down.

That woman?
Hi. It‚Äôs me. Call me Plastic.

It started like this: My boyfriend and I are staying at this motel in this backwards, glitchy little town. Not naming names, but let‚Äôs just say if Twin Peaks and Craigslist had a baby, it would be this ZIP code.

We find someone‚Äôs stuff‚Äîpictures, baby clothes, her whole emotional history‚Äîscattered perfectly across the back parking lot like some kind of tragic Pinterest flat lay. And just like that, she‚Äôs gone. No explanation. No follow-up.
Just gone.
The clothes were the goodbye.

Weeks later, my boyfriend looks me dead in the face and says:
‚ÄúPlastic‚Ä¶..is that your stuff?‚Äù

And it was.
MY clothes.
Arranged.
Under the one working light in the pitch-black parking lot. Like someone said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this symbolic.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt even noticed they were missing yet. But somebody else did. Somebody who apparently wanted to give my wardrobe a send-off I did not consent to. And probably sniffed my panties  

And ever since? I keep seeing it.
	‚Ä¢	Piles of clothes in alleys.
	‚Ä¢	Toys painted weird colors.
	‚Ä¢	Trash cans staged like abstract art.
	‚Ä¢	People just‚Ä¶ gone.

And no one reacts.
They‚Äôre just like, ‚ÄúOh yeah, she went to rehab.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe got a bus ticket home.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey left.‚Äù
Left where? Narnia?

Someone whispered that it‚Äôs a sign. That the clothes are a marker. A warning. A flag for whoever‚Äôs out here making people vanish with the flair of a B-movie villain. I said fool what drugs are you doing cause share boo! lol  

Apparently, I was next.

But guess what?
I didn‚Äôt go anywhere.
I‚Äôm still here.
Not just surviving‚ÄîI‚Äôm THRIVING IN MY OWN ORBIT, radiating anti-possession energy and drinking iced coffee like it‚Äôs holy water.

I didn‚Äôt get disappeared. 
I got louder.
I got weirder.
I got harder to erase.

So yeah.
The clothes always come first.
Because of course if I go missing, let‚Äôs be real obviously i will NEVER run away. Never leave my girls and it would be a setup. Cause I ain‚Äôt going out like some little biznatch.",1,1747642575.0,u_Famous-Plastic-5703,0,1.0,False
