1ikk1wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ikk1wr/high_end_coffee_experience/,High end coffee experience,"Hi all just wondering on your thoughts about my coffee business idea. I have a good looking coffee cart that I can put anywhere where there is an electricity outlet. I don’t want to go full time with this because not a big fan of gambling, so my idea is to offer the best possible coffee experience for people with money. If they have a party or a gathering where people have nothing to do while everyone comes, I could serve a speciality coffee with all the customer interaction, comparing coffees, explaining how coffee is made (got a manual lever espresso machine so people can see espresso being made in front of them), giving to taste the difference between different coffees and hopefully blowing their minds off. Coffee is one of very few areas where rich and poor share, meaning doesn’t matter how much money one has, they’ll likely drink the same coffee as less wealthy. So I’m trying to add some “jazz” and experience into the mix, with hopes that someone who wipes their arse with 2k would want this for their small scale event. I can take care of the visual side of the business so that the cart and the equipment don’t look like I’ve just rolled off of some farmers market, and I have many years of customer service experience in high end restaurants so that part won’t be a problem. My question is, do you reckon there would be a market for  this? I am talking about private events, not weddings (everyone just wants to get smashed) or corporate events.

1ikk1e1,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1ikk1e1/a_letter_from_the_other_woman/,A Letter from the Other Woman,"To you,

I’ve thought about you a lot over the last three years. First things first, I want you to know that I didn’t know you were together.

I would see your name on his phone when we were together and he would ignore it, telling me you were his crazy ex. I even pushed him about it and he sincerely looked me in the face and guaranteed me that I was not acting as someone’s monkey branch. Even after you showed up that day, he assured me you were crazy and bitter and he had woven this story and gotten his poison so deeply in my brain that I let myself continue to believe it.

It’s interesting now, 3.5 years later, that I see how he did the same thing to me. He made you (us) feel crazy. He would tell us he was home, that he was tired, that he was working while really he was with the other person. And when your gut told you he was lying and you went yo check his house? Of course he wasn’t there. When you thought to check the place where he hangs out and found him with me and (understandably) were furious? Of course it can be spun as a crazy ex. But you weren’t crazy. He intentionally wanted you to feel insecure, to not know where to take your next step- and he made sure to set the scene for you to be just an obsessive, psychotic ex when you finally found the truth.

He did the same thing to me. But I didn’t know he was capable of that. He would stay out until the early hours drinking and then stumble home either angry or without any announcement at all. Sometimes he wouldn’t come home. I would ask, but that would be met with rage about how I’m controlling or boring or whatever. I was lied to regularly. I never thought he was cheating, though, I just thought he had an alcohol issue.

Until one day something within me told me to look. To look back two years and see if his story about you was true. Well, it wasn’t. He lied to us both.

In that moment, and in many moments after, I have thought of you. I wanted to know everything about you. I wanted to know if we were similar. How you and him started. How you ended. What he promised you about your future with no intention of following through- he said you were crazy and would mention how insane it was that you told him you wanted to marry him and have a family. But I bet he told you that he wanted that too. I told him the same thing and he told me he was on the same page, while he was already starting a new book (actually a couple of new books) and methodically erasing every line in my story to fit the narrative of “crazy ex.” Intentionally leaving out details. Refusing the answer the phone for long hours. Lying directly about things (things which would have given me both the freedom to leave and seek out real healing and relationships and the agency to decide what energy to put into the relationship knowing there was never any intention of a future). 

I wonder how much of this he did to you too.

But you know what I don’t understand- you and him have reconnected. He called you. I don’t know how much you talk. I know you call him a sweet nickname and you send songs back and forth and that you met for coffee.

Did you know he told me he wasn’t talking to you? Did you know he would delete your texts (when I asked he said he didn’t want your name to flash across his screen when we were together)? He told me he was cold to you. That he was establishing boundaries. When I found out that wasn’t he true, he told me it was my fault that he was seeking comfort in someone else- even though I was giving everything I had to save our relationship because he was telling me he wanted it while simultaneously he was treating me in increasingly cruel and abusive ways and blaming me for his addictions, his lies, his anger, his loss of employment, his mental health. But he promised he was working on it and wanted me, and I was so poisoned that I kept destroying myself.

And he was rekindling his flame with you the whole time.

Did you know I was still in the picture? If you did, did it feel like some revenge, some reassurance that you are better than me? I don’t think you’re evil, I think he is the most charming executioner to ever live and I could see him painting that picture for you. Did he tell you I was crazy? That I was so in love with him? That I couldn’t accept that we were not together?

If you didn’t know- can you not see the same signs? Sense that you might be standing on the other side of the same glass where you once looked 3.5 years ago?

Why would you go back to him? He left you for me and is now leaving me for you- although he never actually left either of us and instead turned us into ghosts with feral hearts losing themselves to the need for proof that the reality you force on us is not the truth and that the reality we know in our hearts and see with our eyes and puzzle together in our minds is really happening- because you tell us we’re insane and wrong when we have concrete evidence directly in hand.

How did he charm you? Do you believe him? I have grown to care for you. To fill in so many little details of who you are and, honestly, to care for you. I want to run into you. I want to reach out to you. But I know that would get twisted because, once again, you’re under his spell.

I hope the best for you. I truly didn’t understand what happened until far too long after the fact. I’m sorry for the hand I had in crushing your heart and tearing up your mind- I was deceived and manipulated and I paid by losing so, so much of myself while acting in that role for 3.5 years.

I hope you see through him this time. I hope you one day know that I, in some weird way, care deeply for your well being and happiness. If it’s revenge on me for the thought that I knew about you and didn’t care- that is misguided and will leave you empty. If he told you that I was gone (I am now, but not when you came back 6 months ago) and he hit every note in the manipulator’s melody just right to make you feel a familiar emotion that he told you was love- I hope you can use the past to get away.

You deserve to be happy. You deserve someone who will be truthful about you and with you. You deserve someone for whom you are not only the first choice but the only choice. We both do. I wish you the best, and I am truly sorry.

Ear ringing and tinnitus can be more than a nuisance-they can significantly affect your quality of life. Fortunately, there are natural ways to alleviate these symptoms. In this article, we reveal five proven remedies to combat tinnitus, with Quietum Plus taking center stage as the most effective solution.

# Remedy #2: Reduce Caffeine and Stimulants

High levels of caffeine and other stimulants can exacerbate tinnitus symptoms. Cutting back on coffee, energy drinks, and even certain sodas can help reduce ear ringing and improve overall well-being.

# Remedy #3: Embrace Relaxation Techniques

Stress is a known trigger for tinnitus. Meditation, deep-breathing exercises, and gentle yoga poses can help calm your nervous system, reducing the intensity of ear ringing and promoting better sleep.

# Remedy #4: Sound Therapy

Using soothing background sounds—such as nature recordings or white noise—can help mask the internal noise of tinnitus. Over time, this can retrain your brain to ignore unwanted sounds.

# Remedy #5: A Balanced, Anti-Inflammatory Diet

A diet rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory foods can support nerve health. Incorporate leafy greens, berries, and omega-3 fatty acids to help combat inflammation and promote overall auditory health.

# Conclusion

While there are many natural ways to combat tinnitus, Quietum Plus stands out as a comprehensive, science-backed solution. By addressing the underlying causes of ear ringing, Quietum Plus not only masks the symptoms but works to restore lasting balance to your auditory system.

Getting around Albania can be an adventure in itself. Here are some tips for smooth transportation:

### Respect Local Customs

Every country has its customs. Being respectful can make your travel smoother:

- **Dressing Modestly:** In places of worship or rural areas, dress conservatively. This shows respect for local traditions.

Your packing list can make or break your experience. Consider the following:

But I can never forgive him, he abandoned me and betrayed me.
“I screwed up. I know that, but you haven’t given me one chance to explain—”
I cut him off right there, “Explain? You’ve had eight years to explain, Lucas. Eight. Years!” I was beyond livid. “I sent you countless emails and letters, giving you every opportunity to explain why I walked into your house and caught you getting sucked off the girl?”
He roared. “I couldn’t let you put your life on hold for me when I knew I wasn’t worth it.” 
I reached for his hands and pulled them from my face. “You were successful, Lucas,” I croaked in a quiet voice. 
“I know now, more so than I did then, exactly how unworthy of me you actually are.”
————————
Emerson
Hey there, baby girl.
Those four words had haunted me for so many years.
This can’t be happening. This can’t be happening. I thought if I just kept repeating that in my head, I’d wake up from this horrible nightmare. It had to be a dream because there was no way he could be standing right in front of me. God, or Karma, or whoever was in charge couldn’t possibly be that cruel… Right?
My entire body had gone numb the instant I heard those words. All of the air had whooshed out of my lungs. I was frozen solid. That was, until I dropped the pot of coffee I’d been holding, causing it to break and splatter scalding coffee all over my legs, burning out of myself in the process.
“Shitfucksonofabimbo!” I hollered, dancing from foot to foot. I knew I looked like a complete idiot, but I couldn’t help it. That really freaking hurt. Jeremy and Brett immediately jumped into action, grabbing paper towels from the counter and wiping down my legs. Tears pricked the backs of my eyes as I looked at the angry red welts now covering me from knee to ankle.
Screwing Texas weather! I thought. I had to wear the shorts and my legs were burned.
I was immediately pulled out of my weather-bashing trance when I felt Savannah’s fingers gripping my forearm. “Holy god. Are you okay? Did that hurt?” I couldn’t process all of the emotions raging through me at that very moment. I felt anger, fear, anxiety, and a little bit of giddiness, which just pissed me off.
“No, Savvy.” I clipped out. “It felt awesome… Of course it hurt!” I was being an absolute bimbo to a person who didn’t deserve it, but it was taking everything in me to keep from falling to my knees and bursting into tears, or scream my fury at the top of my lungs. I was a mess! Luke was standing right behind me. What was Luke doing standing right behind me?
Spinning around, I narrowed my eyes at the culprit that caused the coffee pot massacre. It had been eight years since I’d last laid eyes on Lucas Allen, and in all those years he’d only managed to get even more attractive. 
8 years ago, Luke and I were best friends everywhere. We grew up together. But Luke decided to join the military.
“Emmy, baby, it’s okay,” Luke told me in a consolatory tone. “It’s just the Marines. It’s not the end of the world.”
I didn’t understand how he could be so casual when I was completely petrified.
“Are you out of your freaking mind?” I screeched. “We’re in the middle of a war, Lucas! You just signed up to go over to a war-ravaged county and potentially lose your life in the process. Please explain to me how that isn’t the end of the world?”
If anything were to ever happen to Luke, it would be the end of my world. I had no doubt about that. 
Luke grabbed my shoulders and pulled me into his chest.
“Baby girl, I know you’re mad right now, but this is something I just have to do,” he said as he ran his hand down the back of my head, ""I promise you, I won’t get dead and I'll come back.”
I hated his gentleness, which made me defenseless.
That night, I got pregnant with Luke's child. But more things happened afterward.
Those deep emerald green eyes, surrounded by dark black lashes that would make any girl envious, burrowed right into my soul as he stared back at me. I might have been in meltdown mode, but it wasn’t lost on me that all six feet four inches of him was looking dangerously hot in a tan deputy’s uniform. So this was the new deputy that Sherriff Carlson had hired. Perfect.
“Oh, baby girl. You okay?” Luke came rushing over to me and hunkered down to inspect the welts that had already formed on my legs. The shock caused by his touch made me jump back. “Don’t move, Emmy. Let me take a look.”
Who does this guy think he is? “Don’t touch me,” I whispered through clenched teeth.
“Emmy, please. Just let me take a look, okay? I’ve dealt with burns before. I know what I’m doing.” As he reached for my leg again, it took every ounce of my energy to resist the urge to haul off and kick him square in the face.
“I said, don’t. Touch. Me.” The heart-clenching pain that took me so long to get rid of was coming back in full force. 
“Emmy—” he started, but was interrupted when Savannah pushed between us, all five feet three inches of her radiating so much anger she was practically vibrating.
“Look here, Special Officer Asshat. I don’t care if you’re the goddamned Surgeon General himself. She said not to touch her, so you don’t touch her!” Each word out of her mouth got louder and louder until she was yelling in his face. 
Luke slowly rose to his full height and glowered down at my friend with sheer intensity. I had to hand it to her, she didn’t even blink.
Grabbing her arm, Jeremy tried to interve ne and calm Savannah down. “Easy there,” he whispered into her ear, eyes locked on Luke the whole time, like he was preparing for whatever was to come. “Stand down, killer.”
She spun around and leveled Jeremy with a death glare so intense, I fully expected him to burst into flames. “Screw that!” she screeched. “He can’t just walk in here after eight years and act like he didn’t do a thing wrong!” She spun back around to face Luke again. “You call her baby girl one more time, and I’m going to punch you so hard, you’ll be shitting teeth for a week! You don’t get to call her that. You aren’t even worthy of breathing her air.”
The scene in front of me had escalated to epic proportions. I was finally able to suck in enough air to kick start my brain back into action. “Enough!” I yelled. “This is a public restaurant, not a goddamned boxing ring. We are not doing this here.” I addressed Savannah first. “Honey, I know what you’re doing and I love you to pieces for it, but I got this, okay? You can retract the claws.” I jerked my attention over to Luke, wishing I had laser beams in my eyes. “You need to leave. Now.”
“Emmy—” he started, but I cut him off.
“No! For eight years, I wasn’t important enough to get so much as a letter from you. You don’t get to roll back in to my town and show up at my diner acting like nothing happened. You haven’t had a thing to say to me in eight years, and I don’t have anything to say to you now. Get out, Luke.”
I turned my back on him, not bothering to watch him walk out the door and turned my attention to the patrons of Virgie May’s. “And all of you,” I addressed the crowd collectively. “Drink your coffee, and eat your breakfast. Don’t act like this is the first time y’all have ever seen drama here. This is Cloverleaf, for Christ sake.”
With that, I turned and headed to the office in the back of the diner. My little rant having just expended all my energy.
I had just collapsed into my office chair and begun to massage my temples when the door creaked open. I didn’t open my eyes to see who it was until I heard something being placed on my desk. Looking up, I saw Brett pouring bourbon into two shot glasses. Once full, he slid one in front of me and took the other for himself. “Brett, it’s eight thirty in the morning. Not really the time to be pulling out the hard stuff.” I initially objected mainly because that was how a respectable person would react to having hard liquor for breakfast. Truth was, I fully intended on getting wasted.
“After the things that just went down, Emmy Lou… I’d say now’s the perfect time.” Brett was another one that I’d known for forever. Even though he’d always been closer to Luke when we were teens, he and I managed to form a tight bond after our so-called friend disappeared. I guess the mutual feeling of betrayal was a good catalyst. After all, I wasn’t the only one that Luke left behind.
Picking up the shot glass, I downed the amber liquid in one gulp, reveling in the burn as it slid down my throat and settled in my belly. “Set up another,” I said as I slid my glass back in front of him. He took his first shot at the same time I took my second.
We sat in amicable silence for what seemed like forever until Brett finally broke it with the one question I feared the most. “What are you going do, Emmy? It’s a small town. Someone’s bound to let it slip.”
I knew what he was asking, but there was no way I would consider talking about it again. It had been so long ago and set my life on a path that I wasn’t proud of. It had taken everything in me to pull myself out of the downward spiral that loss caused me. “Let them talk. It’s not like I didn’t try to get ahold of him, Brett. You know that. He’s the one that refused to respond to any of my messages.” I poured another shot and drank. I was starting to feel the effects of the bourbon. My heart rate had slowed and my shoulders were beginning to feel nice and relaxed. “I’ve finally cheer myself up together. I’m not going to let him come back and ruin everything I’ve worked for.”
I could feel the burn of tears in the back of my throat trying to make their way out. I wasn’t going to let that happen. I’d cried too many times over what Luke had done to me. I was done with that. He didn’t deserve my tears. Seeing me struggle to keep my emotions in check, Brett stood and walked around the desk, wrapping me in his arms. “I know, Emmy Lou. I know. You’re one tough bimbo, that’s for sure, and I’ve got your back no matter what.”
I hugged him back as tight as I could. “I know, Brett. And I love you. But call me a bimbo again and I’ll stab you.”
We both laughed and squeezed each other one more time before Brett pulled away and left the office. 
I've been living a very happy life for all these years thanks to Brett and Savannah, and I definitely don't need Luke coming into my life.",1,1739008310.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Sa totoo lang, binalak ko siyang dalawin this year, now that I have freedom to do so. But, oh well, this is life.

For context, my (19F) parents separated when I was just six years old. Since then, sa mother’s side na ako tumira and I was restricted to visit or go to my father’s place since nung about 10 years old ako.

My father rarely contacts me. Within that time span, no calls nor VCs, never ko nang nakausap si Lola. Indirect kumustahan lang.

I have vivid memories due to my traumatic past on their side, and I also remember her taking good care of me nung doon pa ako nakatira. She’s the only person good to me and my mom that time.

Actually nitong January lang, ang random pero natanong ko kay mama why do I love and know old songs so much. Sabi niya nakuha ko raw kay Lola nung bata ako. Kaya siguro hanggang ngayon memorized ko pa mostly.

I really planned to visit her this 2025. Then suddenly, Thursday ng gabi, nag-chat si papa. Na-stroke daw si Lola nung Monday, then comatose. I study far from home kaya bumyahe agad ako kahapon, Friday, after ng class. Deretso na sa hospital.

See? Ambilis lang bumyahe. Pero sa isang dekadang ‘yon, hindi ko man lang nagawa.

Sabi nila, baka ako lang daw hinihintay niya. Lagi raw niya akong bukambibig, hinahanap. Ako raw ang laman ng kaniyang mga panaginip. Pinasulat pa nga niya pangalan ko para daw hindi niya ako makalimutan. Wala man lang akong kaalam-alam.

Ang sakit. She was still in coma but responsive to my words. “‘La, kahit hindi mo na ako makita o makausap, hindi bale, alam ko at ramdam ko kung gaano mo ako kamahal”. “Hindi mo man na ako makita, ako pa rin ‘yung makulit mong apo. Pasensya ka na sa isang dekadang hindi ako nakadalaw.”

Kaninang umaga, she passed away. Hinintay mo lang ba talaga ako, ‘la? Sana narinig mo lahat ng pagsamo ko. Mabigat man sa pakiramdam pero alam kong nagkaintindihan tayo. Hanggang sa muli. Your memories will forever live in me.

Hindi ko na kayang ituloy ‘to. Mahaba na rin pala. Akala ko sa pelikula lang ‘to nangyayari. Now I’m alone in a coffee shop, crying, reminiscing everything.",1,1739008236.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Pop Mart is not the only Blind Box company, as well as Starbucks in Coffee shops market or Nike in sneaker industries. If not a few dozens, there are several hundreds of toy company making blind boxes. Brand loyalty is understandable and can sometimes be a result of personal preferences or past experiences.

Collecting blind box toys is an exciting and rewarding hobby that allows us to discover unique and artistic creations from various designers and artists. While many collectors may have developed a fondness for a particular brand, it's crucial to remember that the world of art toys (Blind Box) big and diverse.

POP MART has undoubtedly made a significant impact in the blind box toy market in 2016 to present with their distinct designs, hosting events, heavy marketing and collaborations, Specially the LABUBU trend in 2024, A lot of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out, Bandwagoner, Scalpers from other industry joined the Hype). However, limiting our collections to just one brand could potentially mean missing out on incredible creations from other talented artists and manufacturers.

True appreciation for art and design knows no boundaries, including brand affiliations. By trying different blind box toy brands, we open ourselves up to creativity and artistic expression. Each brand brings its own unique style, themes, and collaborations to the table, enriching our collections and broadening our horizons.

Ultimately, brand loyalty can coexist with an open-minded approach to collecting. Let's embrace the diversity within the art toy world, appreciate the talents of all artists and toy manufacturers regardless of the brand, and enjoy the thrill of discovering new and captivating our individual preferences.

Michelle had sent me for more hamburger for the guests she was expecting. And to look for her husband:

“Tell him to get his lazy ass home! I could use a little help.”

She and Barack had retired from public life after his last term, and had bought a rundown house up the road a ways. I’d been hired as a general assistant.  Michelle was cool. Barack was annoying. But, hey, the pay was good. 

I went to a local diner I knew for the extra hamburger. I knew Marcell would sell me some. An old place, and a little rundown, but a staple in the area for the retired let’s drink coffee and tell lies club. 

“Well, here comes this sonofabitch!”  Ok, here he was.  First stop.  Convenient.  Kill two birdies with one stone.  

“Gentlemen” he proclaimed to his doting admirers among whom he’d been holding court, “This man is a pain in my ass. But at least he gets the job done.”  

That SSgt - what was his name again? 

And I’m gonna demand a raise. 

“Michelle wants you home.”

“I don’t answer to her.  I do what I damn well please”, he said, as he finished his coffee in a gulp and bolted for the door. 

“Need five pounds of hamburger, Marcell.”

Michelle was working the grill when I dropped the extra hamburger off:  “Thanks, OP.  That should be enough.”

Barack was trying to figure out how to open the lid on a cooler.  Kept tugging, but it wouldn’t come  up.”

“Other side, dear”, from Michelle.

“Oh - oh yeah.”

Don’t know what she sees in him.

“OP, two of the guests wandered up the road past the house.  Looks like they missed it.”

I looked toward the road just down a short dirt driveway. Be hard to. 

“I know, honey.  Could you go find them please?”

“Michelle” from Barack, “There’s no ice in here.”

“In the freezer.”

“Oh - oh yeah.”

I found ‘em not far up the road.  They hadn’t been able to go any further, with the high mesh fence across the road, with a sign:  “Military Preserve Keep Out.”

Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence!  Well, how ‘bout That?”  Hope she’s hungry. 

“It’s back this way. If you’ll follow me.”

Then it started to pour rain, and we were quickly soaked. Jenn took off her blouse to wring it out.  Should’ve worn something underneath. But even nicer than I’d always expected. 

Michelle was grilling in the rain when we got back:

“I can’t find the freezer, Michelle” from Barack.

“Sigh” from Michelle.  “OP?”

“We’re all on the same team” from me. 

“Plagiarism!” from Barack. “That one’s mine!”

“Go find me some snipes, Dear” from Michelle.

“I’m on it!”, and he ran off into the trees. 

I went inside. Before I got the ice, gonna go pee. There’s a bathroom off of this bedroom. 

Nicholson was there.  I’d known he was. Had the new baby with him. 

“Hi, Jack.”

“Saw your wife outside, OP.  Gotta say;  she ain’t much.”

Oh, you sonofabitch. 

“Put the kid down, Jack.”

A bad moment during it when he threw a plastic grocery bag over my head and tried to smother and choke me with it, but I was motivated.

Drug him into the bathroom, stuck his head in the toilet, and gave it a flush.  “Payback for Guantanamo, you asshole!”

Picked his head back up by the hair:  “Gonna apologize?”

“Are you accusing me of a Crime?”

“Back in you go!”

I’ll show you a few good men.

Here’s the Real Fix!,"Ever brewed a cup of Nespresso only to find it tastes burnt, weak, or just “off”? You’re not alone! Here’s how to fix it and get perfect-tasting coffee every time.

 PROBLEM 1: Your Nespresso Tastes Burnt or Bitter

✔️ Cause: Old coffee oils stuck inside the machine.

✔️ Fix: Run a cleaning cycle:

1️⃣ Remove any capsule.

2️⃣ Run three water-only cycles to flush out old residue.

3️⃣ Wipe the spout with a wet cloth.



 Bonus tip: Instead of tap water, use filtered water-prevents mineral build-up!



⚡ PROBLEM 2: Coffee Tastes Weak or Watery

✔️ Cause 1: The machine needs descaling.

✔️ Fix: Use a descaling solution-or white vinegar/water mix-run a cleaning cycle.



✔️ Cause 2: Wrong capsule size.

Also make sure that a Ristretto capsule isn't used but an Espresso or Lungo instead, having more coffee in it.



✔ Cause 3: Machine needs a reset

✔ Solution: The Lungo button should be pressed and held down for 5 seconds to restore all settings back to the normal position.

Saturday morning, we were out and about, took our 5yo to the acquarium for a couple of hours and then were planning to meet friends for a late lunch. We had some time to waste, went window shopping and then stopped at a nice cafè to drink and have a snack.

We got in - it's me (with a huge pregnant belly, my husband and my 5yo) - and after a couple of seconds a woman in her 50s (maybe) gets in after us. 

We were speaking to the host, asking for a table (they were setting for lunch, so I had supposed, since we just wanted coffee or juice, they would give us a table in the window area, where there are a couple of couches and armchairs and low coffee tables). He is telling us exactly that, and leading us to a sitting area, when the woman - at the same exact time - dunks her purse and coat in the chair he is pointing at and slips herself into the other. 

The host politely tells her the table is already assigned and to please wait to be seated, he will be with her in a second..

She immeditely gets in his face and loudly asks: ""Why? WHY???"" And starts to complain that she wants to sit there, we got in at the same time, and she doesn't see why she should move. 

We are flabbergasted, holding our coats in our hands, my husband timidly trying to tell another waiter: ""It's fine, we can sit somewhere else"". But the colleague whispers: ""Don't worry, let me handle it"".

She starts pointing a finger at us and yell: ""Is it because they are a cute little family? So they get to have a privileged treatment??? [Mocking voice] Oh, look at me, with my giant belly and my stupid little perfect child! [My 5yo at this point is like this 😲 His eyes the size of saucers] I am not here alone! I am waiting for my friend, we have an appointment for lunch! We will spend more than they do and not even leave a mess for you to pick up, like they would!""

Guys, there was plenty of room for everyone, the place was not full. We could all have sat quietly and comfortably.

In the end, she left, slamming the door, because the manager didn't budge (I think at this point, he just really wanted to get rid of her, it was a matter of principle for him).



Now... she looked very respectable and normal, but maybe she was unbalanced. It's just that I have never felt so much poison and resentment for ""cute little families"" as in this woman's voice (I admit sometimes children are not easy, but ffs we had not done anything yet to disrupt the other patrons' peace and quiet, nor did we do anything afterwards, really). I thought this kind of hate for ""breeders"" could only be met on Reddit subs, but this was the live show.

To then have to try and answer my 5yo questions: ""Mommy, did we make the lady angry? Did we do something wrong?"" really made me want to break something.",26,1739006437.0,Mommit,10,0.82,False

“I think we can, C.""

“Let’s set down.""

The clearing was more than large enough even for the forge. Clorinda spotted it as they emerged from the trees and sighed with relief. She could finally stop. Vix set them down in the meadow, gently pressing the grass and flowers flat. Its four propellers slowed to a stop as the forge settled into the dense vegetation. Clorinda lifted her cockpit door and swung herself outside. She spread her arms wide, stretching out her fingers to feel the air flowing gently between them. She took a moment to enjoy the heat of the sun on her neck and face. She laid down and let the grass scratch and tickle her upper back. This was her first time in nature since childhood. She removed her left arm, rubbing her shoulder at the join. She wanted not to feel the metal. She wanted grass and earth and the warmth of the sun. 

Vix fanned out the forge's panels and drank in the sunlight. 

“You ok?” asked Clorinda. 

“Perfect”, replied Vix. “I’ll be charged for flight within the hour, or for forge-work in two.”

“Oh, there’s no hurry Vix”, Clorinda said. “This could be the perfect campsite.”

“C, you’ve seen the footage. It’s not safe out here in the woods.”

“Vix, look around you. Where’s the danger?”

“I expect it will arrive by night.”

“Come on, V, they’re lying! Lying to keep us in! This could be paradise. This *is* paradise! Look at these flowers! Smell them!”

A blue, holographic chessboard bubbled up from the centre of her metallic left palm. 

“Knight C6”.

“Oh, are we still playing? Bishop B5. I’ll be alright if the wolves come. Or the bears. Or even the cannibals; I suspect they only want organic matter. It’s you I’m worried about”. 

“Vix, I will take my chances. I’m done with Nottingham. I can’t spend another day behind that wall. You’ve known that for longer than I have. A6”. 

“Okay C, I’m here for you. Bishop A4. Are you concerned about reprisals?”. 

“Knight F6. Reprisals? I’m on leave. I have months of privacy privilege and we’re well out of range. That gives me a while to plan, to think...”  

“Okay C, I’m here for you. Have you considered food and water? I have only thirty days' reserves. Castle”. 

“Think bigger, Vix. You have more than supplies in there, you have tools. We can use what’s around us. Make it work.”

“Okay C, I’m here for you. Remember though that your friends will be worried. You don’t want to lose contact do you?”

Clorinda bit her lip. She often wondered whether Vix meant to nag (or whether AI could mean anything at all). She could feel her stress rising. She tried to focus on the feel of the grass and the sight of the sky. But she knew that what she’d done was reckless. Other than getting up and over the city wall, getting clear, she had no plan. 

“Just…Bishop E7”. 

“Okay C, I’m here for you. Rook E1”. 

“Pause.”

Clorinda breathed deeply. ‘Friends don’t pause friends’, she rebuked herself. She ran her right, organic hand along Vix’s deep purple shell. She remembered spray painting it that colour when she was nine. Her father reading behind her, their collie Bub stretched out on the lawn. Having beaten Dad at chess, she won the bet and was rewarded with the right to paint the family solar-forge. She chose the colour. 

It became a trademark. Clorinda’s parents ran a ramshackle operation, turning scrap into valuable, usable tools. The forge was an old design even then, but it worked well, focusing the sun’s rays into intense heat to make metal and plastic malleable. The work fascinated Clorinda. She would spend hours with her mother, melting, hammering, soldering, sculpting. She was proud of their creations. They weren’t rich by any means, but the waste-smithy paid well enough to send the gifted Clorinda to a private school. There, she learned advanced mathematics, chemistry, biology. And then university in the far north. By day, she learned the principles of solar, wave and wind. By night, underground lectures in apartments and dingy classrooms introduced her to politics. But when the university was bought by Gisbourne, all of that stopped. Clorinda headed home to Nottingham, aged 21, for a prestigious job as an engineer. 

She took the forge with her all that time, with its shuttle as her main mode of transportation. Again, it became a sort of trademark. Her peers couldn’t understand it. An ugly, home-painted shuttle with a dated AI assistant, attached to a lumbering old solar-forge? Why not something new? But this was only one of the many eccentricities Clorinda’s genius afforded her. Her employer, the Gisbourne Organisation, was a notoriously strict regime. Not just anyone could keep their own personal vehicle, let alone an entire forge. This privilege stemmed from Clorinda’s status as the pre-eminent engineer and waste-smith on the Isles. No other Nottingham subject could take off for so much as a week, let alone months, without contact. No other subject was granted such a generous privacy privilege. The company did not want to lose her. 

And yet, lose her they had. Clorinda did not know what she would do, but she knew what she would not. She would not return. She would not give Gisbourne another moment of her time and labour.

She watched the sunlight twinkle on Vix’s panels. 

“Turn on. B5”. 

\*

It was morning in the clearing. Clorinda had slept in the cockpit, curled awkwardly behind her steering wheel. 

Vix woke her at 0600 with soft light and an ersatz coffee aroma. Clorinda stumbled out into the body of the forge. 

It was cavernous. Five chambers emerged from a central hangar. The first was the living space, designed for a single waste-smith to live in relative comfort. A fold-down bed, a basic kitchen and a spartan bathroom were all that it offered, but all, Clorinda supposed, that she needed. She walked into the bathroom and showered, her head bowed to avoid mirrors. 

The second chamber was a toolshed. It housed the family’s equipment that dated back generations. Some hammers and spanners even bore the early 21st century family firm’s name - ‘Gray Toolmakers Ltd’. Those with the name-stamp were preserved and displayed, never used. 

The third chamber was Vix’s domain. At the centre of the room stood a vast 3D printer, topped by scanners and cameras. Vix could print and reprint any design Clorinda prototyped. Her only limitation was the amount of raw material she could harvest from the North Sea waste islands. That material, mostly plastic and metal, was stored in the fourth chamber. It was topped by a vast, thick glass dome that focused the sun’s rays, melting down the scrap and readying it for the printer. The first of its kind, the solar-forge was designed by Clorinda’s mothers and remained a popular technology for those who preferred to lead lives of self-sufficiency outside the walled cities. 

The fifth and final chamber was the one that worried Clorinda: even with her privileges, its contents could cause her serious trouble. The chamber was filled with prototypes for Gisbourne Security. Every tool here was designed for espionage and the suppression of dissidence. Chemicals were stored on one shelf, electrical equipment on another, armour parts on a third. Everything here was Clorinda’s own work, her own design, but it was all owned by Gisbourne. All prototypes with nothing yet produced at scale, they would nonetheless notice its absence. Clorinda would have to make a plan before that happened. 

In this first hour of waking, dreams floated up through her memory. Protestors hauled into the air by thick, black tentacles. Bloody organs transferred from young to old. A sickly woman running on an energy mill until she collapses from exhaustion. Pure, naked hunger on the streets. In one dream, she watched herself. She was standing on a balcony, a glittering ballgown hanging from her shoulders and a glass of delicate champagne poised in her hand. Below the balcony, wails and a churn of human flesh. Smoke and ash. She was laughing. 

It wasn’t real now. She'd left it behind. There was no tipping point, no one cruel act that made her storm out in disgust. Instead, a moral nausea had seeped into her thoughts and coloured her perception of every moment. 

“Good morning, C.” Vix’s voice surrounded her. “What would you like to do today?”

“I… I don’t know.” She hadn’t thought about it. It was 0633, the sun was mostly up and the hours stretched languorously ahead of her. Excitement wrestled fear in her chest. 

“I suppose we could go for a walk.” 

\*  

Hours passed. Clorinda’s mind cleared as she embraced the simplicity of placing one foot before the other; it was all she had to do. The trees filled her field of vision. Their trunks were thick and covered with moss and lichen, knotty and gnarled. Clorinda touched them gently, enjoying the variety of textures. Soft moss, smooth wood, brittle branches, dense mud. A stark contrast to the rough concrete and hard onyx behind the city wall. 

She felt tired, not catching her breath; she wasn’t fit enough for days of trekking. She crouched on a bed of ferns. 

“Let’s wait a minute.”

“Sure, C”. Vix’s voice came from a lightweight, colourful drone that hovered behind Clorinda. “Here.” The drone dropped a protein bar and a can of sparkling water into Clorinda’s hands. 

“Thanks,” she panted. “Okay… rook c7.”

\*  

Night had fallen but Clorinda couldn’t sleep. Her body was exhausted but her mind felt frantic. She kept half-forming and discarding plans and ideas, still sparring with Vix on the chessboard. She couldn’t believe this was really her life. Since childhood, she had been taught to fear the wilderness and now here she was in the centre of it, surrounded by the sounds of owls and crickets and animals she had never known. 

She sprung out of bed and made her way to the shuttle. Buckling into the pilot’s seat, she detached from the main body of the forge and rose noiselessly into the night sky. Sailing over the treetops, she opened the roof and breathed in deeply. She enjoyed the soft rush of air on her face and took in the delicate scents of jasmine and pine. Then she looked straight up and gasped at the sight of the stars. 

“Oh, Vix…”

She kept the craft hovering and simply stared. 

She kept sailing until well after dawn, surveying the landscape. There was a waterfall that intrigued her and a huge variety of trees. As the sun rose, animals of all kinds began to emerge or retire; most could only be seen through Clorinda’s thermal vision filter. 

What surprised her was the sight of homes hidden beneath the canopy. Although now a wild wood, this area was once a small town. From the air and with the use of sonar, Clorinda mapped out the network of abandoned cottages scattered through the woodland. 

“This place was abandoned,” she reasoned aloud to Vix. “Must be a hundred years ago or more, judging by the height of the trees.” 

She picked a house at random and touched the shuttle down by its side, weaving between branches as she did so. A curved brick wall stood a few meters ahead. Clorinda examined it, brushing leaves to the side. It was covered in moss and lichen but the text was still visible, carved in elegant gold letters. 

SHERWOOD

She pushed through thick brambles and stinging nettles on her way to the front door. She peered through the windows and saw ancient furniture, chewed and torn by a century’s worth of nesting beasts. But there were books on the shelves too, and art on the walls. Letting curiosity overcome fear, she used the strength in her prosthetic hand to wrench the lock from the door and push it open, gingerly. “Sorry…”, she whispered to whoever had once held the keys. She found tins of fruit and beans in the kitchen and an ancient gas stove. She found books on cookery and flicked through, marvelling at the colours and the authors’ smiling faces. Upstairs, she found a room filled with soft furnishings and a wardrobe bursting with elegant (though now moth-eaten and thin) dresses and suits. She found a child’s room, with a cot, toys and a dressing-up box emblazoned with a name, ‘Carrie’. She wondered who Carrie had been and where she had gone; she knew the most likely circumstance and felt a brief chill. 

Brushing silt from the windowpane, Clorinda examined the branches and leaves outside. A bird was perched in front of her face, with only the thinnest layer of glass between them. It was small and delicate with a white chest, a grey body, and fierce, orange eyes glowing from its black head. Its gaze pierced Clorinda. She felt as though it was watching her dreams. 

  
\*

Nine weeks was a long time in the wood. Early on, Clorinda had asked Vix to stop reminding her of the time and to take away all clocks from the shuttle and forge’s displays. She wanted instead to follow the sun’s rhythm. 

The days were indulgently slow. For the previous five years, Clorinda had worked harder and faster than anyone else at Gisbourne. Before, she had outpaced and outthought her peers at university, and earlier still, she had trounced even her most ambitious classmates at London’s most competitive private school. But now, she walked slowly. Her feet lingered between steps; often, she stopped to pick a daisy or a blade of tall grass. When once she listened to propulsive beats as she ran on the energy mills, now she listened to nothing but birdsong and the gentle sway of branches in the wind. 

She felt guilty. She felt lazy. This feeling prodded her into action in the forge. Having washed herself and her clothes in the waterfall (the shocking cold losing its sting with time), she decided to transform this water into a source of energy. In the forge, she created a small hydroelectric system from wood and tin, then installed it under the waterfall. The wheel spun and with pride, she watched as the monitor showed the kilowatts ticking up. 

Next she turned to the house. The boiler and cooker were useless; they ran on a gas supply that had been switched off or run dry centuries ago. But the roof was fitted with solar panels. Balanced on the hovering shuttle, Clorinda carefully cleared them of years’ worth of muck and debris. She gently pushed the panels away and cut them back just a little, opening up a space in the canopy from which they could absorb the light. Vix printed a set of smaller, more efficient panels and Clorinda attached them all around the house, supplementing their power by connecting her hydro-wheel. 

She designed an induction hob to replace the kitchen’s obsolete gas tools and spent a happy day installing it. When she cooked her first meal of simple steamed vegetables, she congratulated herself on bringing this ancient house closer to a functioning home.

\* 

Another month passed like this. Exploring, foraging fruit and fungi, renovating the cottage and making power - all of this filled Clorinda’s days. When her work was over, she brewed tea from freshly picked nettles and played chess with Vix until she fell asleep. 

She was content, still enjoying the solitude. She did not yet want for human company, though she knew that at some point, she must. Who would she want to see first? Who would she miss? Not Steven, her lab partner and erstwhile ‘best friend’. She worried that she'd led him on. Not Jemma, a childhood confidant. Each meetup had grown increasingly strained, too full of references to events from too long ago. Not Magnus and Iris, or Ash and Mya. Tacking onto a couple was enervating. 

Robert Loxley had not crossed her mind in years, but it was his face that now shone from her screen as it blared an obnoxious ring. 

“What in the…” she muttered. He wasn’t part of Gisbourne and so wasn’t on her blocked list. He might have been if he’d even occurred to her before she left. They had been obsessed with one another in their final year of school but he broke contact abruptly and disappeared, she later learned, to fight in the West. That was six years ago. 

She ignored the call but he tried again. She declined. It rang again. 

“For God’s sake,” she muttered as she answered the call. “Robbie?”

“Clorinda!” came his sparky voice, though she thought it may be a little deeper and sadder than she remembered. “Are you in Nottingham? We… me and Alanna, you remember Alanna? We need your help.”

Clorinda said nothing. 

“Hey, C… you know I wouldn’t call if it wasn’t urgent…”

Here’s How to Fix It!,"If your Nespresso machine is not brewing coffee properly, dripping slowly, or tasting weak, you’re not alone. Here’s a step-by-step guide to troubleshoot and fix it.



1. Check for Clogged Needles

Over time, coffee grounds and mineral buildup can clog the piercing needles that puncture the capsule. Here’s how to clean them:

*  Unplug the machine.
*  Open the capsule compartment and look for the small needle.
* Use a paperclip or needle to carefully clear any blockage.



2. Descale Your Machine (Fixes Low Pressure & Slow Drips)

The mineral buildup from water can reduce pressure. Descaling removes it:

*  Fill the water tank with 50% water + 50% descaling solution (or white vinegar).
*  Run a brewing cycle without a capsule.
*  Repeat with clean water to flush the system.



3. Capsule Isn't Piercing? Try This!

In case it isn't puncturing, then:

* It could be misaligned-replace it in the right place.
* A broken batch-retry with a different capsule.
* Used needle-replacement might be necessary as the spikes become dull while puncturing capsules.

Pro advice: In case of any reason, the machine is not working; it can be restarted by pressing down the brew button for about 5 seconds.

1ikj5w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ikj5w7/my_girlfriend_and_i_got_profiled_by_police/,My girlfriend and I got profiled by police,My girlfriend (F36) and I (M32) are Native American and she is Spanish who live In Colorado.  We were out shopping for her sons shoes and went to a store in the nicer part of town to see what we could find. We go in and walk around and see nothing. We decide to leave and go get coffee before I go to this rehab for addiction treatment that I go and speak at every Friday night and hold a meeting. We come out of the store and I see a cop walking from the group of cars we were parked in. Didn't think much of it then he moves and pulls around behind us and parks I know then something is up I sit there and he gets out and starts walking up to the passenger side. I roll the windown down and he says I am just doing checks of cars and saw parafernalia in the middle console and need both of you to step out. We both are like wtf are you talking about. Mind you we do not drink or smoke weed both legal things in our state. He says a straw right there. We both look and laugh and tell him it's a nail glue that is stuck. He kinda looks in with flashlight and is like oh is that what that is. And then I hold my Book up and show him saying we are on our way to a rehab to speak to addicts and help them. He has a stupid grin on his face and says oh are you. Then goes Well can I see some IDs? My girlfriend says why do you need IDs he gives the typical cop line I just like to know who I am talking to. Girlfriend said we have not done anything wrong so I think we are free to go correct he says yep that's correct have a goodnight. We ponderd on why we got profiled like that. Is it because we look mexican and he was fishing to see if we had warrants or were illegals. Me and her both understand the ICE thing we both started carrying when Denver and Aurora started having major problems with the Venezuelan gangs we have empathy for the illegals who are here working and are good people we don't know for sure but we believe a few of our friends are illegals but they are good hard working people and we wish they could get a work visa if that's the case. But we also understand too many bad ones ruined it and they need to be sent back. But it defentily set a standard for people that look like us that we need to be careful and probably stay in our neighborhood instead of traveling to the white areas and standing out like we did. It was quite sad to be treated like that as we are both in our home country and work hard had a big family together and raise our kids to be upstanding but now I need to sit the oldest boy down and talk to him about this and his skin color and how to act so he does not lose his life or get put into a situation. My brother was shot and killed by police a few years ago no weapons and not a violent offender but he was not living a great life but nothing came of that it was deemed justified and that there set the tone for me that we move wrong they can do what they want. ,3,1739005071.0,offmychest,1,0.8,False
1ikj5c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1ikj5c0/need_help_with_delonghi_primadonna_class_infuser/,Need Help with Delonghi Primadonna Class Infuser Misalignment and General Alert Error,"Hey everyone,

I recently purchased a **Delonghi Primadonna Class** for my birthday four days ago. After the initial setup, I was really happy with the results. Unfortunately, yesterday it suddenly stopped working and now displays a **“General Alert”** error.

After some research, I found it odd that the infuser would already be flagged as “heavily soiled” after just four days. Upon inspecting it, I noticed the infuser is clearly **misaligned** (attqached Photo 2).

I came across these threads that describe almost the exact same issue:

* [General Alarm](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1hjj70y/general_alarm/)
* [Infuser brewing unit stuck](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1cwbstc/delonghi_magnifica_s_infuser_brewing_unit_stuck/)

The solutions suggested in these posts (e.g., a reset button on the power cable) don’t work for my machine. The Primadonna Class only has a standard power switch (atleast I found no other one), and there’s no physical reset button. Because of the “General Alert” error, the machine won’t even enter the automatic infuser-realignment mode.

I’ve already contacted the retailer, but they’re not coffee machine experts and just advised me to send it in for warranty repair.'

**Before I do that, I wanted to ask:**

* Has anyone else experienced this and got some Tips for me?
* Is there a **manual way to reposition the infuser** without sending the machine in?

I’d hate to be without it for weeks if there’s a simple fix. Any advice or insights would be hugely appreciated!

The shop is a quaint place tucked in a medyo tago na building.

The owners roast their own single origin beans which surprised me looking at how small the place is. This is the very definition of a “local neighbourhood coffee shop”.

I tried their mocha and it was good for 170 considering the size and price of competing coffee shops within the area.

i also bought their beans pero mamaya palang iroroast ni sir victor(owner). So i can’t comment on how they taste pa.

Sadly they are closing na this month end. Hoping you could visit their place while they are still operational.

May mga items din sila for sale like yung fellow ode nila and some books.

My girlfriend is Swedish and I’m away for half a year on a gap year around Asia, so I cannot be with her for valentines. As such I’ve written a script with an accompanying video. I’ve kinda just put it in google translate and will look at the words individually with a friend but I’m hoping someone can have a Quick Look over to make sure the words sound good. Thank you! :)

Goodmorning Pooki,

I am a tad far away from you this year. As such I’ve decided to produce you a small video. I remember the Christmas letter you gave which I loved and meant so much to me. 

And I hope this video can give you the same feeling .

Eight thousand, four hundred and eighty nine Kilometres. That is currently how far away we are from each other right now. (Probably)

Now, Let me give you another number 
One thousand, four hundred and thirty three Kilometres is how far away we met for the first time, it was also the same distance we fell in love with each other. (Probably)

Distance can mean everything, it can mean mean small things like not grabbing coffee with you, to not watching the sunset with you and waking up in bed before you and watching your face bask in the glow of a sunrise as I wake up early.

It can also mean very little, not a day goes by I don’t think about you, I have seen your face in perhaps a thousand different calls, photos and videos. I have traveled across countries in these past months visiting places and wonders, from the tallest mountains to the smallest cutest cats, but not one step of my adventure could I forget your pretty smile and those wandering eyes.

You are worth the distance, you are worth the sacrifice, I will love you always.

Happy valentines my love
And wishing for next years one to be closer to you.

Swedish translation from google.

Gud morgon, Pooki,

Jag är lite långt ifrån dig i år. Därför har jag bestämt mig för att göra en liten video till dig. Jag minns julbrevet du gav mig – som jag älskade och som betydde så mycket för mig.

Och jag hoppas att den här videon kan ge dig samma känsla.

Åttatusen fyrahundraåttionio kilometer. Det är så långt ifrån varandra vi är just nu. (Troligtvis.)

Låt mig ge dig ett annat nummer:
Tusen fyrahundratrettiotre kilometer – det är avståndet från där vi träffades för första gången. Det var också samma sträcka som vi blev kära i varandra på. (Troligtvis.)

Avstånd kan betyda allt. Det kan betyda små saker, som att inte kunna ta en kaffe med dig, att inte kunna på solnedgången med dig, och att vakna ensam istället för att se ditt ansikte bada i soluppgångens ljus när jag vaknar tidigt.

Men det kan också betyda väldigt lite. Det går inte en dag utan att jag tänker på dig. Jag har satt ditt ansikte i kanske tusen olika samtal, bilder och videor. Jag har rest genom länder de senaste månaderna, besökt platser och sett underverk – från de högsta bergen till de minsta, sötaste katterna. Men inte ett enda steg i mitt äventyr har jag kunnat glömma ditt vackra leende och de där förtrollande ögonen.

Du är värd distansen. Du är värd uppoffringen. Jag kommer alltid att älska dig.

Glad alla hjärtans dag, min älskade.
Och jag hoppas att nästa år vara närmare dig

I am looking to switch from my nasty nespresso coffee maker to a decent real coffee machine. I have been googling and researching for quite some time now, but I still am not able to decide and pull the plug. So here are my problems and dilemmas, in the hope that someone might give me an advice and push me towards making a decision.

I usually drink a longer espresso / lungo, whereas my GF drinks a capuccino. So a steam wand is a must, but I wouldn't mind waiting a bit for the steam to heat. I like drinking my coffee early in the morning, before leaving for work, so shorter heat-up times would be preferred.

My brother has a La Marzocco Linea Micra and it is a really nice coffee machine - a golden standard in my oppinion, but it is too expensive at 3300€. My parents have the Sage Barista Express Impress with the half-automatic grinding and tamping and it works fairly well for the price, but it does not feel as high-quality as some other machines and I expect it not to last as long. I would prefer something of really good build quality, so that I can use it for a long time. I don't have a problem spending 1200€ on a machine that is really good, but then again I ask myself whether it is really worth that much more than a cheaper machine...

Here are some machines that I were considering:

* Gaggia New Classic Evo (400€) - Gaggia would make sense if I were to find a used one and convert it to Gagguiono: used old classic model for 150€ (2010 build, no 3-way vent tube) plus gagguino kit maybe 300€ - lots of features...
* Rancilio Silvia (600€) - Not much different than Gaggia, but significantly more expensive
* Sage Barista Express (600€) - Too expensive currently, but if I would find a new for 400-500€ it might be a good deal
* Sage Barista Express Impress (660€) - The integrated tamper is not the best, but it helps keep the counter clean; This is a decent deal I think
* Profitec Go (950€) - Still a single boiler at this price?
* Stone Lite (920€) - Good lineage (Rocket), great looks, heavy, ... But plastic knobs and it seems the Stone is now dead - so what about maintenance and repairs? I like it a lot though...
* Lelit Mara (980€) - Somewhere between the Stone and the Rocket, no idea how to position it exactly...
* Rocket Appartmento (1200€) - Looks like a beast and I think very high quality, ... Maybe a bit old fashioned and lacking in features? How fast does it heat up?

So, comments, advice?

(Kweichow Moutai BuLaoJiu, Shui Jing Fang Wellbay, Luzhou Laojiao Zisha Daqu)","My wife and I fell in love with baijiu during a trip to China. We love a good drink, and, besides hearing that baijiu was strong, hadn't heard any of the crazy reputation it has in the West. We went in blind, and I'm glad we did. 

Baijiu is easily one of the most delicious and fascinating liquors out there, and if you've shied away or turned your nose up, you're missing out.  Baijiu doesn't just intoxicate, it plays with your sense of taste as you drink it. It exposes you to flavors way outside what you'd usually taste outside China. And it has an effect similar to Sichuan *málà*, numbing your mouth slightly after the first swig, making each subsequent drink even more pleasant.

We tasted a bunch in China, but now that we're back in the US for a while, we sought some out here and picked up six bottles. Here's my tasting notes for three of them (more to come at some point). These are what I wrote at the time, as I tasted them, only edited for grammar/typos.

# Kweichow Moutai Bu Lao Jiu

## 贵州茅台 不老酒

**Sauce-aroma**

It makes sense to me that Guizhou is situated so close to Shicuan as its world-famous liquor shares so much in common with its neighbor's world-famous food. Both attack at the first meeting of substance and tongue. That initial bite or sip is full of trepidation. Indeed, the bite or sip itself fulfills your fears. But as fast as the knife plunges, it's over. The heat becomes background noise, mere static, as a rush of flavors spread over your palate. Now, the call to drink (or eat, as it were) becomes overwhelming, and you forget your hesitance. That second sip rewards your neglect. The heat is gone. It's all flavor, intense and persistent, joining hands with the aftertaste from before and intensifying beyond.

This particular baijiu—my first in about a year and a half—makes me want to explore more of the flavors of the world. There are things in here that I don't know how to express. It's citrus, like grapefruit... but not quite. It's roughly sweet like molasses... yet not. It's undergirded with earthy umami like buckwheat... ah, not so. There's an acidity like sour gummi worms, but that's too unrefined to capture what I'm experiencing. For once, I want my internal catalog of flavor-memories to expand, to be able to better express these extraordinary tastes. Unlike wine, or sake, or coffee even, they're not hidden. They're screaming from the mouth-roof-tops—but I have no name for them. 

After the swallow is over, a bit of dryness remains, and a faint buzzing from the strong alcohol. The flavors linger, too, though only faintly.

It's rich, powerful, lasting, yet clean, sharp, and bright. Like the heroine of a Xianxia drama.

# Shui Jing Fang Wellbay

## 水井坊井台

**Strong-aroma**

I'm completely flabbergasted. This is the single greatest hard liquor I've ever tasted. The alcohol is strong, painful even, yet somehow elegant, pleasant. Not in a masochistic way, but in a purposefully releasing way, like a powerful massage digging deep into pain with pain to excise and usurp with pleasure. 

Gosh, I forgot the smell! I usually don't give much of a hoot for the nose of a drink—I'm here for the internal effect. But this is something else. The outsized force of the scent makes it a perfume even at arms' length, sweet and citrus, like sitting in an orange grove. 

But back to the taste. Grapefruit, tangerine, rose, the peels off a large grape, papaya, and, as always with these baijiu, something earthy underneath. Perhaps it's the sticky rice it's brewed with. 

There's something numbing in it too. The roof of my mouth feels funny, like I've had a shot of novocaine. 

My wife notes rock candy, and I think that's a really good observation.

# Luzhou Laojiao Zisha Daqu

## 泸州老窖紫砂大曲

**Strong-aroma**

The aroma is quite floral, though the specific nature of that quality I can't discern. It's floral like walking into an over-stuffed flower shop is. It's so fragrant, that my air-quality meter is registering it in the air, even from the other side of the desk.

The bite on this one is powerful! Even after multiple swigs, I still end up shivering as the strange baijiu aggressiveness soaks through the tissue of my mouth, searing my lips and driving a stake right into the space where my neck meets my head. The aftertaste is fairly brief, though, as baijiu goes. 

So, it's back to another sip. There's a certain amount of salinity to it that adds to the alcohol bite. The grapefruit-like taste is there, as expected. Unripe, greenish plum. The funkiness I've come to expect and enjoy in baijiu appears, but only briefly. Honestly, it all comes and goes so fast—leaving me with just a faint, tannin-esque puckering—that I can hardly take the notes I want. 

Another sip. The body is smooth—almost silky. That silkiness is hard to feel, though, through the other intense sensations.

I'm certainly not turned off of Luzhou Laojiao, but I think this might be my least favorite of the current bunch. I just don't feel particularly inspired by it.

**Styling a Large Coffee Table:**

* **Balance with Seating:** Ensure your sofa and seating arrangements complement the size of the table.
* **Layer Decor Elements:** Use books, candles, and decorative trays to create visual interest.
* **Consider Material and Texture:** Rattan, glass, or marble-top large coffee tables each offer a unique aesthetic appeal.

**The Charm of a Rattan Round Coffee Table**

For a touch of natural warmth and texture, a rattan round coffee table is an excellent choice. This eco-friendly material brings a relaxed, organic feel to any living space, making it perfect for coastal, bohemian, or tropical-inspired interiors.

* **Eco-Friendly Choice:** As a sustainable material, rattan is an environmentally conscious option for furniture lovers.
* **Versatile Styling:** Pairs beautifully with soft textiles, natural wood, and earthy tones.

Whether you prefer a sleek modern round coffee table, a spacious and functional large coffee table, or a nature-inspired rattan round coffee table, the right choice will tie your living space together effortlessly.

I'm also on ADHD meds which I can't drink on so I'm carful of the days I take my meds and the days I drink, she knows this. 

So a couple months ago i went through some health issues and have kind of stopped enjoying drinking so much. My body just doesn't always tolerate it well and I have some bad memories of the last couple times I went out drinking with her. But she's been going out several days a week. I'd say anywhere between 2-5ish days sometimes and it seems that all she wants to do is drink. She knows I'm not in a place where I can drink often but still all she asks to do is ""lets go to the bar"", ""lets go to a club"", ""lets drink tonight"". 

I can go to a club/bar and not drink and have lots of fun, but she still insists that i have a drink. If I don't she will constantly think that I can't possibly be having any fun. Or when I do drink and know I don't want any more she wants me to do more shots.

I'm just tired of explaining that I don't need alcohol to have fun. I enjoy clubbing and dancing sober too. She also knows a bit about the health stuff I went through but wasn't really there for me, even though I was there for her. Which I probably am still a bit upset about but I'm trying to get over because you can't change the past. But she knows what I went through to some degree still insists I drink when she knows it could trigger some stuff.

She makes me feel so boring sometimes. like I'm not a real college student because I don't want to go to a party or smoke etc. I just want to do more chill things. I want to go on walks, visit new coffee shops, go to my local farmers market, have movie nights and stuff. 

Also some of her friends have done stuff I really don't like, so I don't want to get drunk around these people. They have done her dirty and I don't want to leave myself vulnerable in front of them.

She says we are friends forever which is sweet but we are so different. And she just kind of recently remembered I existed so I feel like thats why she wants to drink so much with me.",1,1739003576.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1ikirmt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ikirmt,2 months of playing,"Every day, 0 buys, watched every ad. Took me couple days to realize where are dailies and that only through them you get levels.
I got really lucky first week, getting an epic sniper rifle from gold case, having all green gear.
I saved all the gold only for buying S grade chests, 10 at once so you get them for 2700.
In the first 10 sgrade chests I got really lucky again with Exo bullets, my first S grade item that I still use. You can upgrade Sgrade items with normal items of same rarity and slot, I didnt know that.
Then it was just grind, went through two events, christmas and chinese new year that gave me some extra sgrade chests, I got a cyberdeck now. First legendary was revolver bought from challenges, second was the Ocular visor from challenges. I completed the basic levels and all the vehicles except tank which I have 4/5 parts right now, any info on when level 23 comes out or where is the last tank part? Some of the levels were free, I think levels 13-15 I did first try, the later games are just total randomness and bullethell, grind and eventually you'll get it.

Some tips that I have: 
Hover heels are the best shoes, you basically have jetpack and can outjump anyone. Stay in the air as long as possible and you'll only have to dodge projectiles.
Anything other than revolver youll have slow movement speed and need a huge coffee or you get eaten by fast enemies, therefore I only use revolver or sniper.
Watch all ads for maximum bonuses if you dont want to spend money. It annoyed me first but then I got really stupid temu or scam game ads that I sent to my friends and we all had a laugh. I made it part of the game.
If you get a bad upgrade from a guy at the start restart the level.
Going in and out of the normal level triggers the random free crate you can get for watching ad. You can farm gold and silver keys like that, extremely time consuming but if you make it somehow fun you can get all the greys and greens, if you spam it all day you can probably merge together an epic or two. I never really farmed it but discovered its possible through lot of resets fishing for daily powerup objectives.

I posted this comment. thought it could be useful to everyone, So I made a post out of it.

I was working since I was 14, I worked multiple Jobs in different fields. From serving strawberry and lime cocktails at local weddings, to being a regional development manager at Ford. Here’s my strategy:


 
•	⁠ Look like a professional. Even when applying for an entry level job. You don’t have to be over the top, If you’re a boy trim your beard and wear something clean, If you’re a girl be modest but beautiful. The rule of thumb is, ask yourself I’m I presenting myself and my family in good way or not?

•	⁠ knock doors (literally) walk-in don’t call or apply online just walk-in and say hi, I’m looking for a job.

•	⁠smile (this one is very important) but not too much people will think you’re an idiot

•	⁠show some personality while talking to others, it goes a long way.

•	⁠Tell the truth and always say you’re willing to learn, and be willing to learn. 

•	⁠ Utilize your resources, people you know, and don’t get frustrated.

•	⁠learn positive communication skills, It doesn’t matter what you say, what matters is how you say it.

•	⁠ If you get an appointment with someone arrive early, at least 15 mins early",10,1739003052.0,Tunisia,0,1.0,False

1. Wired Connection: I don't need to worry about battery life.

2. USB Powered: Ideally, the headset would be powered (no battery) for reduced weight. If a battery is necessary, the ANC should be active while charging.

3. High-Quality Microphone: I need clear voice communication for audio chats, ensuring others can hear me without background noise.

4. Strong Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): I work in noisy environments like coffee shops and offices and require strong ANC to create a quiet workspace.

5. Comfortable for Extended Wear: The headset must be comfortable for all-day use and as lightweight as possible.

  
6. Sound Quality: I don't have high requirements for it. I don't usually listen to music.

  
Both On-ear and Over-ear designs are acceptable as long as they meet all the other criteria. Please do not recommend Jabra evolve2 50, as I've already tried it, and the ANC performance was very very unsatisfactory.

* I don't seem to need PPIs

1ikilms,https://www.reddit.com/r/gettingoverbreakups/comments/1ikilms/help_its_been_years/,Help. Its been years.,"I am going to skip to the TLDR version right off the bat.

I (33f) feel almost stuck on my ex (32m), who i broke up with because of his alcoholism/other behaviours that went with it. Its been 5 years and I have felt nothing for anyone else. 

I was so angry at him, and so hurt. Crushed.  Crushed that he promised over and over to be better but could never be better for me, or more importantly, himself. 
In the interest of being the bigger person and maintaining boundaries for my sanity, i cut contact for the first year while he went to treatment. 

He met someone either in treatment or shortly after and theyve been together ever since. 

Im have seen him for brief coffees once every year or so and have pretended like im happy for him and doing well. Everytime i have seen him i see the beautiful healthy man i fell in love with. 

I never got mad at him. I never told him how he crushed me after we split. 

I feel like that ship has sailed,  but i am still romanticizing the relationship and have been single ever since with some dates here and there. 

Help.

""...an NA sponsor is a member of Narcotics Anonymous, living our program of recovery, who is willing to build a special, supportive, one-on-one relationship with us.""

IP No. 11, ""Sponsorship"", Revised

What is a sponsor? You know: That nice person with whom you had coffee after your first meeting. That generous soul who keeps sharing recovery experience free of charge. The one who keeps amazing you with stunning insight regarding your character defects. The one who keeps reminding you to finish your Fourth Step, who listens to your Fifth Step, and who doesn't tell anyone how weird you are.

It's pretty easy to start taking all this stuff for granted once we're used to someone being there for us. We may run wild for a while and tell ourselves, ""I'll call my sponsor later, but right now I have to clean the house, go shopping, chase that attractive..."" And so we end up in trouble, wondering where we went wrong.

Our sponsor can't read minds. It's up to us to reach out and ask for help. Whether we need help with our steps, a reality check to help us straighten out our screwy thinking, or just a friend, it's our job to make the request. Sponsors are warm, wise, wonderful people, and their experience with recovery is ours--all we have to do is ask.

Just for Today: I'm grateful for the time, the love, and the experience my sponsor has shared with me. Today I will call my sponsor.",1,1739002683.0,Just4Today,0,1.0,False

I bought my six year old one of those mugs with the spoon in the handle from around Christmas time. Just a cheap white mug that said Let It Snow on the front of it. I got it on a whim to surprise him with a hot chocolate and movie night, thinking it would make him smile and then end up in the cabinet as a coffee mug.

I was wrong, I dont think it’s spent even a minute in the cabinet. Since I got it in late November, he has insisted on using it for absolutely everything he drinks. He has to stir *everything* he drinks with that spoon.

Tonight, he had it on the kitchen table too close to the edge and the cat decided to take a flying leap onto the table and broke the cup.

My kid sobbed himself to sleep, I made offers of replacing it with an even cooler cup, any cup he wants, and he said he didn’t want a cooler cup, just find him one just like it. 

If any of you guys happen to have it at your store, or hell, even if you picked one up yourself and have it in the back of your cabinet and don’t feel too attached to it, I’d pay for the shipping and the mug and pay you for the time and effort. I’ve never seen him get this attached to an object outside of his one stuffed animal, and I feel so bad for him.
