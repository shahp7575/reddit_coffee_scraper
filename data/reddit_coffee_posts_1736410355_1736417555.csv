1hx9o54,https://www.reddit.com/r/phinvest/comments/1hx9o54/unpopular_opinion_passive_income_is_just_a/,Unpopular Opinion: Passive Income is just a marketing buzzword to get your money,"I've been thinking a lot about this lately...

Sino bang hindi nadadala sa “passive income” dream? Earn while you sleep, daw. Wow, parang ang ganda sa pakiramdam - chill ka lang sa bahay, nagpapasok na ng pera yung investments mo. Pero eto ang tanong: totoo ba talaga yan?

Stocks and Crypto

Sabihin natin nag-invest ka sa index funds or crypto. Sure, mukhang passive kasi “hayaan mo lang, it will grow over time.” Pero teka, sino ba dito ang hindi kinabahan kapag biglang bumagsak yung market? It’s not passive when you’re constantly checking charts and refreshing your portfolio. And kung active trader ka? You’re spending hours researching trends, analyzing data, and making moves - unpaid work yun.

Real Estate Rentals

“Mag-paupahan ka, steady na income yan.”

Yan ang lagi kong naririnig. Pero steady nga ba? Paano kung yung tenant mo hindi nagbabayad ng renta? Worse, what if sinira nila yung unit mo at kailangan mong gumastos ng malaki para ipaayos? At yung proseso ng pagpapalayas? Napakalaking abala. It’s not as passive as they make it sound. Sa totoo lang, real estate rentals are practically a part-time job.

Bank Interest

Okay, this one’s technically passive. Maglalagay ka ng pera sa bank, tapos may konting interest kang kikitain. The catch? Napakababa ng rates, minsan parang alikabok lang yung tubo. Unless milyonaryo ka, good luck na lang kung yung kita ng interest will even pay for your next cup of coffee.

Profit-Sharing Models and Business Investments

“Partner ka sa business, kikita ka nang walang ginagawa!” Sounds great, right? Pero in reality, most of these “opportunities” are either risky ventures, pyramid schemes, or outright scams. Yung pangako ng steady income? Madalas, yun ang ginagamit nila para mauto ka. At the end of the day, sila yung yumayaman, ikaw ang naiwan sa alanganin.

Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)

“Join our team, and you’ll have financial freedom!” Pero alam naman natin ang totoo. Sa MLM, you have to work hard convincing people to join under you. Literal na trabaho to scam others into thinking they’ll get rich too. Passive ba to kung halos araw-araw kang nangungulit ng kaibigan mo sa fb messenger?

Franchises

“Buy a franchise, and the system will do the work for you.” Sure, franchising can be a legit business. Pero ang dami mong kailangang gawin - mag-manage ng operations, maghanap ng empleyado, mag-troubleshoot ng problema. Pagod ka na nga sa trabaho mo, may part-time ka pang mini-McDo.


---


So here’s what I think: Passive income is a myth sold to us by marketing geniuses so we’ll buy into their products, systems, or schemes. The idea of effortless money is enticing, pero sa totoo lang, most “passive” income streams require time, effort, and a lot of risk.

At the end of the day, I’ve realized na mas okay na mag-focus sa active income - earning through hard work and skill. At least yun, sigurado kang kikita.

I'm traveling to Vietnam for 3 weeks to rest, but I actually want to try to revive my literary career.

The novel is about the meeting of a Vietnamese woman and a middle-aged European man - my literary temptation is to write from the first person perspective - the narrator is a girl. (actually one chapter she, the other he - dialogue through that literary form)

I wouldn't need any help to go to the Philippines or other places where more people speak English, but here I need help with the real views of Vietnamese people on Westerners, small cultural details and the like.

So: where can I find a girl who would meet me for coffee one day for an hour, the next day for two hours, the third not at all and so on...

You understand that an escort is not what I need, nor are sexual activities which - as far as I managed to understand - are quite internationalized, understandable and can be translated into literature without anyone's help.

1hx9i4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hx9i4x/whispers_of_the_black_horizon_midnights_vigil/,Whispers of the Black Horizon: Midnight's Vigil,"Katherine Drake stared at her reflection in the precinct's bathroom mirror, barely recognizing herself. Dark circles shadowed her eyes, and her skin had taken on an unhealthy pallor that spoke of too many nights poring over case files. She hadn't slept properly in weeks. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw the text from case files writing itself across her eyelids. She splashed cold water on her face and headed to the morgue. The basement level had always felt separate from the rest of the precinct, but lately it seemed even more isolated, as if it existed in its own pocket of reality. The harsh fluorescent lights did nothing to help her exhaustion as Dr. Harrison pulled back the sheet covering Professor Collins.

The professor's face was frozen in an expression of horrified recognition, jaw locked open as if he'd died mid-scream. His fingers were stained black to the bone, and the blood vessels in his eyes had burst in patterns that looked disturbingly like writing.

""I keep seeing things in the lab results,"" Harrison whispered, hands trembling slightly. ""Words that weren't there before. Sometimes... sometimes I hear them whispering.""

Drake nodded, adding the report to her case file. Six incidents in three months, and each one pushed her closer to believing things she'd spent her career dismissing. The nightmares had started after the second disappearance – dreams of ink that moved like living things, of books whose pages turned themselves.

""You look rough,"" Officer Martinez said, laying out crime scene photos. ""When's the last time you went home?"" Her concern was genuine – they'd been partners for five years, and she'd watched Drake's obsession with the case grow.

""I'm fine,"" Drake lied, studying the photos. The same symbol appeared in each one, hidden in dust patterns or blood spatter. She'd started seeing it everywhere – in coffee stains, in shadow patterns, in the cracks spreading across her apartment ceiling.

Back in her office, Drake mindlessly stirred a cup of coffee that had gone cold hours ago. The ceramic surface was stained with rings that looked unnervingly like the symbols she'd been finding at crime scenes. She'd started taking her coffee black after noticing that cream and sugar formed similar patterns every time she added them.

The case board dominated her office wall, red strings connecting victims in a pattern that seemed more deliberate with each passing day. Miranda Wells, the first to vanish, had left behind a single page that caused nosebleeds in anyone who tried to read it. The graduate student whose notebook spiraled into madness. Marcus Blackwood, found drowned in ink that contained fragments of impossible text.

Drake's phone buzzed with a text that made the screen ripple: ""You're like she was, before she understood. Sterling Books, midnight. Come alone.""

She frowned at the unknown number, detective instincts kicking in. Her fingers moved across the keyboard:
""Who is this? How did you get this number?""

The response came immediately, the words seeming to write themselves across her screen: ""Someone who knows what you're seeing in the margins of your case files.""

Drake's hands tightened on the phone. She hadn't told anyone about that – about the way the text in her reports had started shifting when she wasn't looking directly at it.

""I'm a police officer,"" she typed back. ""If you have information about these cases, we should meet at the station.""

The reply made her screen flicker dark for a moment: ""The station has too many eyes. Some truths can only be shared in shadows. You've seen enough to know I'm right.""

She thought about the symbol that kept appearing in crime scene photos, about Dr. Harrison's trembling hands as he showed her the impossible lab results, about the way her own case notes had started rearranging themselves at night.

""How do I know this isn't a trap?""

The final message appeared letter by letter, each character burning briefly before settling into normal text: ""You don't. But you'll come anyway. Because you need to understand what's happening to you.""

Drake stared at her phone for a long moment. Every instinct from fifteen years on the force told her this was a bad idea. But those same instincts had stopped being reliable the moment she'd taken this case.

After several minutes of internal debate, she checked her weapon, texted Martinez her location ""just in case,"" and headed for her car. Whatever waited at Sterling Books, she'd face she wouldn't be unprepared. 

Drake drove through streets that seemed darker than they should be, even for midnight. The streetlights created pools of illumination that her headlights couldn't quite reach, as if the darkness between them had substance. She'd taken this route to Sterling Books twice before during the investigation, but tonight the streets arranged themselves differently, leading her down unfamiliar alleys that somehow brought her exactly where she needed to go.

The shop occupied the corner of a brick building whose architecture didn't quite match its neighbors. Its windows were grimy with age, but the dirt formed patterns that made Drake's eyes hurt if she looked too long. A bell above the door rang with a tone that seemed to echo far longer than it should.

The interior smelled of mold and old blood. Leonard Kane, who'd taken over after Blackwood's death, sat surrounded by photographs that hurt to look at. Drake had interviewed him before, but tonight something was different about him – his movements too jerky, his eyes reflecting light that had no source.

Kane's hands moved restlessly over his desk, arranging and rearranging photographs with obsessive precision. His fingers left smudges of ink that seemed to crawl across the glossy surfaces when Drake wasn't looking directly at them. The skin of his hands was stained so deeply that it looked like text was writing itself beneath his epidermis.

""I was like you once,"" Kane said, arranging photos with ink-stained fingers. ""Investigating things I didn't understand. Blackwood found me, tried to warn me. But I wouldn't listen. Now I can't stop seeing her – the Silver-Eyed Woman. She appears when the words start breeding.""

""Who is she?"" Drake asked, studying the photos where a figure stood in the background, its limbs arranged all wrong.

""She was the first,"" Kane whispered. ""The first to read the true text. Now she weeps for those who follow her path. Like Miranda Wells. Like Thomas Reid. Like you will.""

A floorboard creaked. Drake turned to find a woman in robes that rippled with living text. But what caught her attention was the expression in the woman's eyes – not triumph or malice, but something like recognition.

""You remind me of myself,"" Terrane Askel said, her voice carrying harmonics that made Drake's teeth ache. ""I was a professor once, before I found the text that changed everything. I fought it too, at first. Tried to explain it away with logic and reason.""

""Where are they?"" Drake demanded, even as the darkness around them began to pulse. ""The missing people – what did you do to them?""

""We showed them truth."" Terrane's smile held something like pity. ""The same truth you're approaching, Sergeant. I see how it's already changing you. The sleepless nights. The patterns you can't unsee. The way reality feels thinner with each passing day.""

She produced a book bound in leather that felt alive. Its pages turned themselves, revealing text that writhed and changed. Drake recognized fragments from her case files, but now they formed a narrative that spoke of vast, dark spaces and things that waited between thoughts.

""Stop,"" Drake whispered, but her voice shook. She thought of her apartment, walls covered with case notes and photos. Her sister had stopped visiting months ago, disturbed by the changes she saw in Drake. Even Martinez kept her distance now, watching with worried eyes as Drake pushed herself deeper into obsession.

""You've already lost too much to turn back,"" Terrane said, something almost gentle in her voice. ""Your sleep, your peace of mind, your certainty about what's real. The only choice now is whether to understand what's happening to you, or let it drive you mad.""

The photographs on Kane's walls suddenly took on new meaning, their arrangement mirroring the pattern Drake had created on her office case board. She saw now that the red strings she'd been using hadn't just been connecting victims – they'd been drawing the same symbol she kept seeing everywhere. And the people in the photos weren't victims anymore, but initiates. Each had followed this

""Come to the old church on Corvid Lane tomorrow at midnight,"" Terrane said. ""See what Miranda saw. What Thomas Reid embraced. What the Silver-Eyed Woman weeps for.""

She melted into shadows that reached for her like hungry hands. The book remained, pulsing like a heart.

Drake's apartment had become a reflection of her fractured state of mind. Case files covered every surface, their pages marked with sticky notes whose text changed when she wasn't looking. The walls were a maze of red string and photographs, connecting points that seemed random to anyone else but formed perfect sense in her increasingly altered perception.

She'd stopped using her bedroom weeks ago. The shadows there had grown too deep, and sometimes she caught glimpses of the Silver-Eyed Woman in her dreams, weeping tears that stained her pillowcase with words in languages that had never existed on Earth.

Instead, she'd taken to sleeping on her couch, when she slept at all. The television stayed on constantly, its white noise helping to drown out the whispers that seemed to come from her case files late at night. Sometimes the screen showed programs that couldn't possibly be broadcasting – stories told in alphabets that crawled like insects across the screen.

Drake spent the next day in her apartment, staring at walls where the wallpaper had begun forming words when she wasn't looking directly at it. Her gun felt heavier than it should, and when she checked the bullets, they'd started writing themselves into new shapes.

Drake gathered her files, each page feeling heavier than it should, as if the weight of the words themselves was becoming physical. Her badge felt cold against her chest, and when she looked in the mirror, she could have sworn the metal had started to tarnish in patterns that matched the symbols from her case files.

Martinez caught her in the parking lot that evening. ""Katherine, please,"" she said, using Drake's first name for the first time in years. ""Whatever you're involved in – let me help. We can work this together.""

Drake looked at her partner – really looked at her – for the first time in weeks. The concern in Martinez's face made her throat tight. ""I don't think you can help with this one, Rosa,"" she said softly. ""I'm not even sure I can explain what's happening anymore."" She tried to smile, but it felt wrong on her face. ""Maybe I am going crazy. But if I am, I need to understand why.""

Martinez grabbed her arm, grip tight with desperation. ""Listen to yourself! This isn't you – the Katherine Drake I know follows evidence, not... whatever this is. Let me call Dr. Moore at Behavioral Health. Please. Before this case takes you somewhere you can't come back from.""

""The evidence is right there in the files,"" Drake insisted, pulling free. ""You've seen it too – you just won't admit it. The way the witness statements keep changing. The symbols that shouldn't be there.""

""I see my partner working herself to exhaustion over six missing persons cases!"" Martinez's voice cracked slightly. ""I see you sitting in that office all night, staring at walls covered in red string, talking about words that move and shadows that breathe. Remember the Wilson case? Three years ago? You told me then that when things stop making sense, you're either missing something or looking too hard.""

Drake felt a sharp pang at the memory. The Wilson case – her first big investigation with Martinez. They'd worked it for weeks before realizing they were creating connections that weren't there, seeing patterns in coincidence.

""This is different,"" Drake said quietly. ""Back then, we were trying to make the evidence fit our theory. This time..."" She glanced at her own shadow, which seemed to move a fraction of a second too slowly. ""This time the evidence doesn't fit anything we know.""

""Katherine."" Martinez stepped closer, lowering her voice. ""You haven't slept more than three hours a night in weeks. You've got case files in your car, your apartment, even taped to your bathroom mirror. Yesterday I caught you reading blank papers. You were nodding like they made perfect sense.""

""You don't understand—""

""No, you don't understand!"" Martinez's professional calm finally cracked. ""We've been partners for five years. You were the one who taught me to trust facts over instincts. To question everything. Now you're chasing shadows and cryptic text messages, and I'm watching you disappear into whatever this is. Please – let me help before it's too late.""

Drake met her partner's gaze, seeing not just fear but grief in those familiar eyes. Martinez had watched her transformation over the months, had documented it in her own careful way: the case files Drake swore rewrote themselves overnight, the shadows that seemed to follow her partner like hungry things, the countless times she'd found Drake reading invisible text in empty margins.

""Rosa,"" Drake said softly, ""if I don't go tonight, we'll never know the truth. And I need to know – even if it costs me everything."" She touched her partner's shoulder briefly, then turned away. ""Don't follow me. Please.""

She walked to her car, feeling Martinez's eyes on her back. The weight of her badge felt heavier than usual, like it knew this might be the last night she wore it.

The drive to Sterling Books felt like passing through layers of reality. Each street she turned down seemed to exist in a slightly different version of the city. The few pedestrians she passed appeared normal at first glance, but their movements were too smooth, too coordinated, as if they were all following the same unheard rhythm.

At 11:45 PM, Drake parked outside the church. Its spires reached toward a sky that had gained impossible colors. Through the stained glass, she saw the Silver-Eyed Woman weeping tears that burned holes in reality. Now she understood – those tears weren't just sorrow, but joy at finding another seeker of truth.

Inside, Thomas Reid waited with his black notebook. He'd been a struggling writer once, Drake remembered, before the words chose him. Now he was something else – a vessel for text that rewrote reality with each reading.

Kane stood in the shadows, no longer fighting what he'd become. And there was Terrane, watching with eyes that held memory of her own transformation.

The doors sealed themselves as Drake opened her case files one last time. She'd started this investigation looking for missing people. Instead, she'd found herself.

Somewhere in the darkness, the Silver-Eyed Woman wept words that spoke of the Black Horizon. And Drake finally understood – it wasn't just a prophecy. It was a promise of what they would all become when the last page turned.",1,1736416652.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

","**THE AGE OF STEAM**

—

**THE ARGUMENT**

The first industrial revolution was based on the steam engine, which James Watt transformed into a revolution source of power that could be used in factories, locomotives, and steamships. During the first industrial era, knowledge and skills flowed from the modernizing British economy to the less developed United States and other countries that struggled to make the new technologies their own.

Like Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay understood the potential of machine-based technology to transform the American economy. Clay’s American System was a comprehensive plan by which the federal government would sponsor industrial capitalism in the United States, permitting the country to catch up with and surpass Britain, the first industrial nation. But Andrew Jackson and his allies invoking the rhetoric of Jeffersonianism, thwarted Clay’s plan for national development by destroying the Bank of the United States and blocking plans for federally financed infrastructure.

In the aftermath of Jackson’s victory, the industrialization of the United States caused the North and the South to grow apart. The southern economy became a specialized adjunct of the British industrial economy, exporting cotton to the textile mills of the British Midlands. Threatened by the success of the antislavery Republic Party led by Abraham Lincoln, the southern slaveowner elite tried to form its own smaller union, the Confederate States of America. But when Britain did not intervene, both the South’s bid for independence and the institution of slavery were doomed.

The period between the Civil War and Reconstruction and the 1890s witnessed the maturation of the steam-based technological system of the first industrial revolution. Until the end of the nineteenth century, the railroad companies dwarfed all other private businesses and rivaled the state and federal governments in their scale and revenues. The disruption of older ways of living and working by the railroads and steam-powered machinery inspired protests by farmers and strikes by industrial workers that were frequently and violently suppressed by the government.

But even as steam-age America took shape, it was doomed by new technologies—the electric motor and the internal combustion engine—that began emerging in the 1860s in the next wave of innovation in the laboratories of Britain, continental Europe, and the United States.

WHY THE CONFEDERACY LOST

—

**The new constitution adopted by the Confederate States of America was poorly designed to enable the South to prevail in a long and costly war for independence**. The Confederate Constitution was the US Constitution rewritten to reflect the anti-statism and anti-industrialism characteristic of extreme Jeffersonian and Jacksonian ideology. The differences between the two documents began with the preambles. **The preamble to the US Constitution states: “We the people the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.” The preamble to the Confederate Constitution replaced “the people” with “the Confederate States,” replaced “to form a more perfect union” with “to form a permanent federal government,” and dropped the phrases “provide for the common defense” and “general welfare.”**

The provisions of the Confederate Constitution were carefully crafted to forestall the possibility that the new government would ever attempt anything like the programs of Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay for national economic development. **The constitution banned the Confederate Congress from appropriating money “for any internal improvement intended to facilitate commerce,” with the exception of improvements for the waterborne commerce that the cotton oligarchs needed to ship their crops to foreign markets.** The Confederate Constitution also outlawed government promotion of manufacturing, providing that “no bounties shall be granted from the Treasury; nor shall any duties on importation from foreign nations be laid to promote or foster any branch of industry.”

Confederate senator W. S. Oldham of Texas in March 1862 described national defense itself as a tyrannical infringement on the rights of the states and the people: “The tendency to indoctrinate the people into the belief that there was no reliance in the State Government was the bane of the old republic, and would be, if not avoided, the bane of this. That government, from its commencement, gradually taught the people to centralize upon it, as the only reliance for their honour and welfare, and bought and bribed them not to rely upon the States themselves. The first measure was the establishment of a National Bank, the next the establishment of a Military Academy at West Point, and a Naval Academy at Annapolis, and so on.”



“A PECULIAR PEOPLE”

—

Even more important in the downfall of the Confederacy than the design of its political institutions was the structure of its economy. **The underlying cause of the war was the economic specialization of the South in the export of cotton to the steam-powered textile mills of Industrial Britain, and the hope of southern secessionists that the South could play the same role in the steam-era world economy as a sovereign nation rather than as part of the United States.**

A few years earlier, Senator James Henry Hammond of South Carolina made the phrase “King Cotton” famous in a speech in the US Senate on March 4, 1858: “What would happen if no cotton was furnished for three years? . . . this is certain: England would topple headlong and carry the whole civilized world with her, save the South. No, you do not dare make war on cotton. No power on earth dares to make war upon it. Cotton is King.”

Hammond and other planters had reason to be confident. They counted on being supported by Britain. In 1860, move than eighty years after the beginning of the American War of Independence, the economy of the United States remained deeply integrated with that of Britain. America’s largest trading partner by far, Britain received more than half of all American exports and provided 40 percent of American imports. In 1860, America’s industries were still in their infancy. Sixty-three percent of imports were finished and semifinished manufactured goods; only 16.3 percent of American exports fell in those categories. US exports were dominated by crude materials, including cotton (61.6 percent) and foodstuffs (22.1 percent).

**Once the Civil War broke out, the Confederacy placed an informal embargo on cotton, similar to Jefferson’s ill-fated embargo of 1808. The purpose of the embargo was to force Britain and France to recognize their dependence on southern cotton and to intervene to help the South win its independence from the United States.**

**While the embargo as well as the Union blockade hurt the British textile industry, the damage was limited by supplies left over from the southern bumper crops of 1859 and 1860. The impact was further limited by imports of cotton from Indian and other sources. And British capital and labor found new uses, in building ships and arms for both sides in the American conflict.** In 1864, the London *Times* observed, “We are as busy, as rich, and as fortunate in our trade as if the American war had never broken out and our trade with the states had never been disturbed. Cotton was no king.“

The failure of Britain to intervene to secure southern independence meant that the Confederacy was forced to mobilize its own resources. While the Union was able to muster the power of northern finance and industry, the Confederacy found itself handicapped by the underdeveloped banking and manufacturing sectors of the South.

In 1861, former US senator from Texas Louis T. Wigfall told a British correspondent: “We are a peculiar people, sir!… We are an agricultural people; we are a primitive but a civilized people. We have no cities—we don’t want them. We have no literature—we don’t need any yet…. We want no manufacturing classes…. As long as we have our rice, our sugar, our tobacco, and our cotton, we can command wealth to purchase all we want from those nations with which we are in amity, and to lay up money besides.”

The journalist James B. D. Debow, writing before the Civil War, did not share Wigfall’s complacency: “Our slaves work with Northern hoes, ploughs, and other implements. The slaveholder dresses in Northern goods, rides a Northern saddle… reads Northern books… In Northern vessels his products are carried to market… and on Northern-made paper, with a Northern pen, with Northern ink, he resolves and re-resolves in regard to his rights.”

The southern states paid an enormous price for their specialization in export agriculture. At the beginning of the Civil War, the Union had a population of nineteen million while the Confederacy had only nine million, one-third of whom were slaves. Northern industry produced ten times as much as industry in the South; the manufactured products of the entire Confederacy added up to less than one-fourth of New York State’s manufacturing by value added. The North had thirty-eight times as much coal, fifteen times as much iron, and ten times as much factory production.

TECHNOLOGICAL WARFARE

—

The Civil War was one of the first large-scale conflicts of the industrial era, foreshadowing the mechanized carnage of World War I. Both sides not only exploited existing technologies like the railroad and the telegraph but also sought to gain advantages by sponsoring technological innovations.

The North controlled twenty-two thousand miles of railroad compared to the south’s nine thousand. Both sides used trains to move their troops rapidly from one region to another and to transfer supplies. And both sides destroyed the railroads of their enemies when they could.

The South had the advantage that it could use its railroads as internal lines of communication. Attempts by the Union forces to concentrate at one point could be met by Confederate troops, rushed by railroads to that location. General Ulysses S. Grant understood this, and promoted his “anaconda strategy” of squeezing the South all along its border, to prevent it from massing its forces. In his memories, he explained that those who could not skin could hold a leg. Grant created a huge railroad depot to supply his forces when they besieged Richmond and Petersburg, while William Tecumseh Sherman, during his march through the South, trained thousands of his troops to repair railroads that Confederate guerrillas had damaged so that they could be quickly used again.

The telegraph system helped to coordinate the war on both sides. To the discomfort of his generals, Lincoln used the telegraph to monitor events and pepper his subordinates with instructions. Telegraphy allowed far greater control over military operations by the president than had been possible in the past. Because the White House had no telegraph line, Lincoln spent much of his time in the War Department’s telegraph office. It was there that he drafted the Emancipation Proclamation, between waiting for news and sending instructions.

THE PRICE OF WAR

—

To pay for the war, the US federal government instituted income, inheritance, and excise taxes, and ran up a deficit of $2.5 billion. To cope with this, the Lincoln administration and its congressional allies created the Bureau of Internal Revenue, later the Internal Revenue Service, within the Treasury Department, as part of legislation that Lincoln signed on July 1, 1862. The law also created the first US income tax, with a top rate of 10 percent on high incomes. After the first federal income tax was abolished in 1872, a federal income tax law was passed in 1894, only to be declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. In 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment, permitting federal taxation of incomes, was adopted. The income tax rate was initially no more than 7 percent on the highest incomes.

In August 1861, Secretary of State Salmon P. Chase, a former US senator and governor of Ohio, pressured northeastern bankers to provide a loan in return for Treasury bonds. When it became clear by 1862 that the war was going to be a long one, Congress authorized a combination of new bonds and “greenbacks” or dollars that were not backed by gold. The New York and New England banks bitterly disagreed with the Lincoln administration on whether bonds should be sold at or below par. The hostility of the northeastern financial community deepened after Chase and Congress decided to finance the war using fiat currency, or greenbacks that were not convertible into gold.

MAGICAL MATERIALS

—

Many other technologies were part of the second industrial revolution in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Often they served the most important technologies, as rubber served the electric industry and the oil industry served the automobile industry.

In 1859, Colonel Edwin Drake drilled a petroleum well in Pennsylvania; his original goal was to substitute kerosene for costly whale oil in lamps. As the oil fields of Pennsylvania were depleted, new fields were discovered in Texas and California and abroad, in Dutch Indonesia, the Baku fields on the Caspian Sea, Romania, Mexico, Venezuela, Trinidad, and Iran. After World War II, new oilfields were developed in the Middle East, Nigeria, Siberia, and Alaska. By 1960, oil surpassed coal as the primary fossil fuel in the world.

When electric lighting replace kerosene lamps, oil found a new use, as a fuel for cars, trucks, tractors, planes, and ships. Natural gas (methane), at first considered a worthless by-product of crude oil, began to be used for heating and transportation.

Rubber was another key technology of the second industrial revolution, important for electrical insulation as well as for its use in automobile tires. In the 1840s, the American inventor Charles Goodyear succeeded in using a blend of sulfur, latex, and white lead to create “vulcanized” rubber. In 1852, when Goodyear sued a rival in Trenton, New Jersey, for infringement of his patent, he was represented by Daniel Webster, while another great American lawyer, Rufus Choate, represented his opponent. Webster brought all his oratorical gifts to bear in describing the new substance: “It is hard like metal and as elastic as pure original gum elastic. Why, that is as great and momentous a phenomenon occurring to men in the progress of their knowledge, as it would be for a man to show that ion and gold could remain iron and gold and yet become elastic like India Rubber.” Webster contrasted Goodyear’s vulcanized rubber with the older kind, which tended to melt in heat and grew rigid with cold: “A friend in New York sent me a very fine cloak of India Rubber, and a hat of the same material. I did not succeed very well with them. I took the cloak one day and set it out in the cold. It stood very well by itself. I surmounted it with the hat, and many persons passing by supposed they saw, standing by the porch, the Farmer of Marshfield.” Goodyear won his case but thanks to further patent litigation he died in debt.

In 1842, Goodyear gave some samples of his product to Stephen Moulton, a British businessman, and they made their way to the Scottish manufacturer Charles Macintosh, who had independently created the waterproof garment that bore his name. But it was in the late nineteenth century that the rubber industry grew rapidly, to supply tires first for bicycles and then for cars.

Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, founded in 1893, became the largest rubber manufacturer in the United States and the world. The Firestone tire business was founded by Harvey Firestone, a mechanic who worked in Akron, Ohio, at his cousin’s factory, putting rubber tires on horse-drawn carriages. Henry Ford visited in 1895 and adopted Firestone’s solid rubber tires for the rims of the metal wheels of his cars. In later years, Ford, Firestone, and Edison vacationed together. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich, the founder of B.F. Goodrich, adapted the pneumatic tires devised by Michelin in France to American automobiles.

**Until the early twentieth century, rubber continued to be derived from rubber trees. Seeking to avoid dependence on the British rubber plantations in Indonesia and Malaya, Firestone established his own rubber plantations in Libera while Ford tried but failed to do the same in Amazonia in Brazil. Between World War I and World War II, American and German chemists learned how to make artificial rubber. This allowed the United States to make a million tons of rubber a year during World War II, even after Japan had conquered Southeast Asia.**

Although steel was superior to wrought iron, in premodern times its cost limited its use to valuable implements like swords and plowshares. In 1856, Henry Bessemer discovered a method to make steel cheap. The Bessemer converter, followed by other innovations, radically reduced the coast of steel, benefiting existing industries like railroads and making possible entirely new uses for steel—in the framework of skyscrapers, for example.

Germany, with its superior system of state-funded research universities, led the world in the development of scientific chemistry and the chemical industry. German scientists and industrialists learned to create synthetic substitutes for natural dyes like Indigo. Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and Alwin Mittasch devised the Haber-Bosch process for creating artificial ammonia used in fertilizers and explosives, including dynamite, which was developed by the Swedish chemist and engineer Alfred Nobel, who used his fortune to endow the Nobel prizes. The Germans also learned to create artificial potash or potassium, an ingredient of fertilizers, as a substitute for the variety derived from plants. The use of fertilizers produced by the chemical industry rather than nature made possible a revolution in agricultural productivity, as did the falling costs of steel farm implements and the development of tractors and other machines using internal combustion engines.

Plastics were another transformative technology spawned by the chemicals industry. John Wesley Hyatt, an America devised celluloid, the first plastic, in 1869, and Leo Baekeland, a Belgian immigrant in the United States, discovered Bakelite in 1907. Applied chemistry also transformed medicine, by supplying disinfectants, anesthetics, and aspirin (discovered by Felix Hoffman and manufactured by the German firm Bayer AG—thus Bayer Aspirin).

Canned food first became important during the Civil War and later allowed growing urban populations to eat preserved meat, vegetables, and fruit. As early as 1870, refrigerated beef was shipped from the United States to Britain, and in 1876 Charles Tellier, a French engineer, devised the first refrigerated ship, the *Frigorifique.* The development of small-scale refrigerators for the home helped to revolutionize domestic life.



THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND AMERICAN AVIATION

—

The federal government also shaped the radio industry, which later pioneered television. The US Navy was wary of Britain’s domination of global communications by means of its global underwater cable system. While taking part in postwar negotiations at Versailles in 1919, Present Woodrow Wilson identified three areas of economic rivalry with military implications between the United States and Britain: oil, production, merchant shipping, and global telecommunications. The United States had a lead in oil production, but the British Empire led in merchant shipping, and the British lead in global telecommunications threatened to increase because the Marconi company was based in London.

Frustrated by the need to rely on the British government because of Guglielmo Marconi’s British patents, in 1919 the navy, led by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin Delano Roosevelt, persuaded General Electric, Westinghouse, AT&T, and other companies to pool their radio-related patents and form the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), to ensure that interlocking American corporations controlled radio development in the US. GE bought out the patents of the American subsidiary of Marconi and gave its patents to RCA.

The initial purpose of RCA was military and commercial, and large-scale radio broadcasting was delayed by the lack of a business model, since anyone could listen without paying. One proposal, a government station paid for by licenses for radio owners, was suggested by David Sarnoff and taken up as the funding model for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). In 1922, AT&T solved the problem differently by selling advertising and linking several New York stations together in a network. Threatened by AT&T to sell its stations and agree to lease its long-distance lines to a new network, the National Broadcasting Corporation (NBC). In 1931, antitrust judgments separated Westinghouse and GE from NBC, and RCA was forced by subsequent orders to sell its Blue network, which became the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), in 1943.

The modern age of television in the United States began on April 30, 1939, when antennas atop the Empire State Building in Manhattan broadcast live images of President Roosevelt at the opening ceremonies of the New York World’s Fair. On the same day, RCA’s affiliate NBC began regular US television broadcasts, which were limited at first to New York and other big cities in the Northeast.

**RCA had delayed the evolution of American television by engaging in patent litigation with Philo T. Farnsworth, a brilliant Mormon from Utah who began dreaming of broadcasting images while studying at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah**. Helped by research engineers at the California Institute of Technology and investors after he moved to San Francisco, Farnsworth established the Farnsworth Television and Radio Company and obtained a patent in 1927. RCA, backing television research by Vladimir Zworykin, a Russian emigre engineer, fought Fransworth over the patent in the courts. The nascent British television industry licensed Farnsworth’s technology and began regularly scheduled programming for a limited audience in 1936. The 1936 Berlin Olympics were the first to be televised. **Only after World War II, however, did television transform society by reaching mass audiences.**

MORGANIZATION

—

The great merger wave produced enormous firms that confronted a fragmented system of nearly thirty thousand unit banks in the early 1900s. In Germany, large universal banks were able to help a firm throughout its life cycle, by making loans in its early years, underwriting shares as it expanded, and policing and monitoring the firm in its maturity, as a proxy for the firm’s shareholders. The growing importance of the stock market in financing large corporations was the result in part of the inability of America’s mostly small unit banks to grow in scale along with businesses, because of state and federal anti-branch-banking laws. Until the 1890s, railroads dominated the stock and bond markets. Then companies representing the industries of the second industrial revolution, like General Electric and US Steel, became important.

As the new corporate leviathans turned to other sources of financing, banks increasingly made loans to small local businesses. The share of corporate debt in the form of bank loans plunged from 32.1 percent in 1920 to 23.3 percent in 1929. America’s small unit banks also lost out in consumer lending to specialized consumer lenders and corporate vendor financing, like that of the General Motors Acceptance Corporation. Many banks were forbidden by law to branch even within their home states.

Investment banks in the United States performed the functions of underwriting and monitoring large corporations by the same method of corporate board memberships that was used in Germany by large universal banks. Investment banking costs were high, however, in the United States, compared to Germany, with its universal banks. Restrictions on the size and resources of banks raised the costs of underwriting securities and bank lending to industrial corporations.

The need for giant corporations to raise enormous sums increased the importance of investment bankers as intermediaries between the shareholding public and individual companies. In 1912, give American banks—J.P. Morgan and company, First National Bank, National City Bank, Guaranty Trust Company, and Bankers’ Trust—had representatives on the boards of sixty-eight corporations whose combined assets added up to more than half of US gross national product.

The dominant figure in American investment banking around 1900 was John Pierpont Morgan, a Europe-educated patrician from a wealthy American banking dynasty. A dedicated art collector, a pillar of the Episcopal Church, an adulterer who supported Anthony Comstock’s Society for the Suppression of Vice, with a nose discolored by the skin disease rosacea and an impressive stature and girth, Morgan was a larger-than-life figure. Morgan’s grandfather Joseph was a founding investor in the Hartford and Aetna Insurance companies. His father, Junius, worked in business in Hartford and Boston for a few years before joining the merchant bank of George Peabody, a Baltimore expatriate living in London. On Peabody’s retirement, Junius changed the name of the firm to J.S. Morgan & Co.

Morgan was born to Junius and his wife in 1837 in Hartford, Connecticut. A sickly youth, Morgan grew into an unhealthy adult who never exercised, saying, when his son began to play squash every morning before work, “Rather he than I.” Educated in Boston, Switzerland, and Germany, and with a degree in art history from the University of Gottingen in Germany, Morgan turned down an offer to stay as an assistant to a mathematics professor at the University of Gottingen and moved to the New York, where he worked for a Wall Street firm, Duncan, Sherman & Co., surprising them when, during a trip to New Orleans, he brought a shipload of coffee and sold it for a profit on the firm’s account, without asking permission. His first wife, Amelia “Memie” Sturges, was suffering from tuberculosis when he wed her; too weak to stand during their wedding, she died four months later in Nice, leaving Morgan a widower at twenty-four. Toward the end of the Civil War he married his second wife, Frances Tracy, with whom he had three daughters and a son, Jack Morgan Jr., who inherited the leadership of J.P. Morgan and Company.

In 1860, he became the American agent for his father’s firm and made his first fortune on commissions for selling US bonds in Europe during the Civil War. Like many upper-class Americans, Morgan avoided service in the Civil War by paying three hundred dollars for a substitute. Later he inherited his father’s firm and formed his own partnerships, first Dabney, Morgan & Co. and then Drexel, Morgan and Co. He formed a syndicate that successfully challenged Jay Cooke’s monopoly of government finance.

**Morgan’s eminence grew in 1879, when he sold British investors 150,000 shares of the New York Central Railroad that William H. Vanderbilt, Cornelius’s son, wanted to divest himself of in order to diversify his holdings. By holding the proxies of the British investors, Morgan got a place on the New York Central’s board and a foothold in the railroad industry.** With Vanderbilt’s approval, Morgan sought to end a war between the New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroad by persuading their directors to work out a truce aboard his yacht on the Hudson River. Morgan frequently invited quarreling railroad chiefs to settle their differences at his dinner table, in his library, or on his yacht, named the *Corsair,* in keeping with his piratical reputation.

**Morgan transferred the technique of consolidation from the railroad industry to other industries. Morgan created General Electric, American Telegraph and Telephone (AT&T), the Pullman Company, National Biscuit (Nabisco), and International Harvester. Morgan’s most famous consolidation was the 1901 merger that produced US Steel, the world’s first billion-dollar company. He paid $480 million for Carnegie Steel, making Carnegie the richest person in the world. The initial capitalization of US Steel—a billion dollars—was twice the US federal budget.**

The process by which the House of Morgan acquired, consolidated, and reorganized railroads and other companies and controlled them by placing Morgan partners on their boards of directors came to be known as “Morganization.” Morganization was popular with shareholders and entrepreneurs who believed that Morgan’s reputation helped the companies attract investment. Charles S. Mellen, the president of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, declared, “I wear the Morgan collar, and I am proud of it.” When a railroad executive spoke about his railroad, Morgan exploded: “*Your* railroad? Your railroad belongs to my clients.”

By 1900, Morgan and his partners had a place on the boards of directors of companies that accounted for over a quarter of the wealth of the United States. **Did Morganization produce criminal monopolies or efficient firms that benefited from technological and commercial economies of scale? The historian of business Alfred D. Chandler Jr. noted that many of the largest US firms in industries such as petroleum, transportation equipment, rubber, chemicals, and food products were the same in 1973 as in 1917. These market-dominating “center firms” tended to be more capital-intensive and technologically advanced than small, labor-intensive “peripheral firms” in the same industry. Chandler found a similar pattern among the center firms of Britain, Germany, France, and Japan, which suggests that the formation of large manufacturing corporations in the second industrial era could only be explained in terms of efficiency, not local conspiracies against the public good**. Building on Chandler’s work, Thomas K. McCraw concluded that these international comparisons discredit polemical accounts of the rise of nefarious “trusts.” The economist Bradford DeLong has concluded that Morganization did produce value for its beneficiaries.

HOW J.P. MORGAN BAILED OUT THE UNITED STATES

—

Morgan was so powerful that it was necessary for him to intervene to help rescue the federal government from financial crises in 1895 and 1907. In 1895, after the Panic of 1893 had caused a depletion of the US Treasury’s gold reserves, Morgan visited Democratic president Grover Cleveland in the White House and promised help. On returning to New York, he locked a number of leading financiers in the ornately decorated library of his lavish mansion and refused to allow them to leave until they had agreed to contribute money to a syndicate that would bail out the federal government by supplying the Treasury with gold in return for federal bonds. The plan worked, but outrage among populist democrats contributed to the party’s nomination of William Jennings Bryan in 1896 and 1900, when Morgan and other American financiers and industrialists, mobilized by Mark Hanna, contributed record-breaking sums of money to defeat Bryan and elect Mckinley twice.

Again in 1907, Morgan was reluctantly called upon by President Theodore Roosevelt to help avert a financial crisis. On the evening of Thursday, October 24, 1907, most of the leading bankers in New York were summoned to Morgan’s library. Morgan ordered them to figure out a way to restore public confidence in the banks, then retired to his office to play solitaire. The plan the bankers worked out was to allow banks to settle their accounts among themselves in New York Clearing House notes, freeing them to lend out their clearing-house balances in the form of cash to depositors. The system had been used successfully in earlier panics. In addition, Morgan raised $13 million in call money for the stock exchange, while John D. Rockefeller contributed $10 million to the national banks in addition to $10 million from the US Treasury.

Shocked by the dependence of the federal government on the private power of the House of Morgan in 1895 and 1907, Congress decided to create an American central bank. On December 1913, eight months after J.P. Morgan died in Rome, President Woodrow Wilson signed the Federal Reserve Act into law. The legislation was based on a 1912 report by the National Monetary Commission, headed by the powerful chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Rhode Island senator Nelson W. Aldrich. Several members of the commission—Alrich, Paul M. Warburg, Henry P. Davison, Frank A. Vanderlip, A. Platt Andrew, and Benjamin Strong, a vice president at Bankers Trust, who later became the highly capable first governor of the New York Federal Reserve—had secretly traveled to the Millionaire’s Club at Jekyll Island, Georgia. They told journalists they were going duck hunting, and Davison and Vanderlip in the earshot of train personnel and other passengers called each other Orville and Wilbur.

The Aldrich plan that emerged from these discussions combined a central board of private bankers with regional reserve banks. The Democratic majority in Congress reduced the influence of private bankers by adding a presidentially appointed governing board in Washington. At the insistence of southerners and westerners who feared the domination of central banking by the New York financial community, a decentralized system of regional Federal Reserve banks was created, in what ultimately proved to be the vain hope that this would limit the influence on the Federal Reserve of the New York financial community.

…

THE MONEY TRUST

—

As governor of New Jersey, Wilson argued in 1911: “The great monopoly in this country is the money monopoly.” This was an absurd statement, given the existence of thousands of legally privileged and protected unit banks, but one that appealed to the Jeffersonian and Jacksonian prejudices of the largely southern and western Democratic Party of his time.

A southern Democrat, Louisiana congressman Arsene Pujo, used his subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency Committee to investigate Wall Street’s role in American finance. In December 1912, Morgan was forced to testify before the Pujo Committee. With the aid of committee counsel Samuel Untermyer, a progressive lawyer, the Pujo Committee issued its report on February 28, 1913. According to the report, American industry and finance were dominated by associates of J.P. Morgan, including the investment banking firms Kidder, Peabody; Lee, Higginson; National City Bank; and First National Bank.

Brandeis drew on the Pujo Committee hearings in a series of essays in *Harper’s Weekly* and a book, *Other People’s Money: And How the Bankers Use It* (1914). Brandeis argued that the leaders of three banks—J.P. Morgan, George F. Baker at the First National, and James Stillman at National City Bank—were at the center of a “money trust” that had captured the American economy. Brandeis complained that members of J.P. Morgan and Co. had seventy-two directorships in forty-seven of America’s largest corporations, while Baker and his First National colleagues served on forty-nine boards, and Stillman and his colleagues at National City served on forty-eight. George F. Baker, a Morgan partner who was also head of First National Bank, sat on the boards of six railroads that owned 90 percent of Pennsylvania anthracite coal. Membership by bankers on corporate boards has been commonplace and uncontroversial in other countries, including the democratic Federal Republic of Germany after 1945. But Brandeis insisted: “The practice of interlocking directorates is the root of many evils. It offends laws human and divine. It is the most potent instrument of the Money Trust.”

BETWEEN THE NEW NATIONALISM AND THE NEW FREEDOM

—

Veering between the poles of the New Nationalism and the New Freedom, federal antitrust policy set by courts and executive branch officials produced an incoherent pattern, producing uncertainty for American businesses and investors. Supreme Court rulings in *E.C. Knight* (1895) and *Addyston Pipe and Steel* (1898) suggested that the Sherman Act would not be used by the federal judiciary to block mergers. However, the Supreme Court created confusion in 1904 by ordering the dissolution of Northern Securities—a holding company created with the help of J.P. Morgan to merge the Great Northern and Northern Pacific railroads. The court found an intent to restrain trade and forced a breakup.

The Supreme Court ordered that American Tobacco and Standard Oil be broken up as well. The penalty against Standard Oil was the equivalent of half the money coined by the US government in a year. Mark Twain responded to news of the fine by quoting the bride on the morning after her wedding night: “I expected it but didn’t suppose it would be so big.” Then in 1920, the court decided in favor of US Steel, even though its president, Elbert Gary, had made no secret of his company’s cooperation with other firms in stabilizing prices in the industry, at meetings known as “Gary dinners.”

The Supreme Court announced a “rule of reason,” but from the beginning US antitrust policy has lacked rhythm and reason. The fact that the United States was the only leading industrial nation that repeatedly harassed and sought to destroy many of its successful industrial enterprises merely on account of their scale can be explained only by the lingering residues of preindustrial Jeffersonian ideology in the radically different circumstance of industrial America.

As the second decade of the twentieth century began, both the New Nationalism and the New Freedom could claim victories in the struggle to shape the emerging American economy based on the technologies of the second industrial revolution. US entry into World War I would shift the balance of power in favor of the New Nationalism, leaving a legacy that would shape American institution for generations.

I'm fiercely independent and have never asked him for money or to buy the things he does. It actually makes me uncomfortable when he does. I don't ever want to rely on a partner for money (I have a financially irresponsible ex husband who still refuses to sign the divorce and claims I owe him money.) Again a strong avoidant trait of mine. 

The arguments and I guess my DA tendencies started about 6 months in. I found I out was doing all the cleaning up at my house when he was there, specifically after the dog who is lovely but has caused lots of wear and damage to my furniture, garden, carpets and decor (this is why he bought the carpet cleaner and paid for the decorating as a birthday present) It just made me resentful and drained as I felt i was becoming responsible for him amd the dog too, making meals, picking up dog poop etc. I tend to bottle up then explode. 

He also seemed unhappy I had other interests outside of him - the gym, solo trave and walks alone or friends, Lego, video games, reading, writing , socialising with friends (usually over coffee and cake not nights out) and the cinema (solo). I did feel I was losing a sense of self.  He would text me constantly even when I've said I'm out with a friend but claims he doesn't expect responses. He says he loves spending time with me but we don't really do anything and I feel I'm missing out. I started to feel trapped and miss my life before him. I told him this and he was devastated at the time. 

He is always declaring undying love, telling me I'm 'the one', he's never been in love before etc which makes me really uncomfortable because it seems so cheesy and trite. I guess that's the avoidant or cynical side of me too. 

But. When we fight (which is ALL. THE. TIME, no kidding) he says some of the most awful things and I'm not exaggerating. Not long after I got my cancer diagnosis and during a row that I don't even remember the reason for, he told me he wished I'd fall down the stairs. He told me I was pathetic and 'wallowing' when it turned out I had cancerous lymph nodes and was worried about distant metastasis after I had my breast removed. I needed 8x rounds of chemo and another surgery plus I've still radiotherapy to go this year and 10 years of drugs. He tells me I catastrophise yet I think my fears are pretty much grounded in reality. Emotionally I've been a mess, admittedly. 

He has told me he hopes I die alone and screaming in agony twice, once just before my 2nd surgery. He's told me repeatedly I put on an act and no one really likes me. He's called me an emotional cripple, selfish, a boot, a cunt, a slag and too many other things to mention. He's got me semi-convinced I'm actually a narcissist. He hates that I've held on to these insults as they're 'just words'. He won't accept that they hurt me deeply. 

I'm in chemically induced menopause so my mood swings and irritability and rage is at an all time high so I must take accountability for taking it out on him. However...I honestly feel like he brings out the utter worst in me. I can't  wait for him to go home when he's here. I do find myself irritated at everything he does but I know I've treated him badly by not being able to talk about how I'm feeling. He says I don't communicate and I don't try but its like everything I do or don't do hurts him. I will admit I shut down during conflicts, won't make eye contact and often stay silent. I know it's emotionally immature but honestly he makes me feel like my mind is empty, and just talks at me for literally hours with the resolution always being that I need to trust him and open up. 

The last big row we had, was the day I got out of hospital, he was supposed to stay at mine in the run up until I went in, which he manipulated into being staying until I got home. I didn't want him and the dog there and to share a bed when I'd just had a pretty nasty op so I wanted him to go after he brought me home which he insisted on doing. Then it was gone 9pm and he's falling asleep or pretending to and telling me he's too tired to drive. I was irrationally angry because it felt like he was changing the agreement and that's something I hate (he says its my control issues) and I did make it so he had to leave. He tore strips off me for days about how dangerous it has been for him to drive so tired and I did feel awful because he was right, but also my mum would happily have driven me home. After taking me to hospital early in the morning, he had done nothing all day, he could have gone home after visiting me earlier on in the evening after seeing I was okay after the surgery. 

Before he left we were awful to each other, I said something horrible and deeply nasty that I said just to hurt him in response to him threatening self harm. In shock/anger, he hit me over the head really hard with a memory foam pillow whilst I lay in bed with my back to him. He's said since that he threw it but honestly I was stunned and thought my nose was gonna bleed. I don't believe its possibke to throw a pillow down with that amount of force. He says he regrets it and it was in response to what I'd said but it seemed way out of line to me. I'm not allowed to mention it as he gets annoyed and says I keep bringing up the past and deflecting away from my own behaviour.  In the past he ripped a Christmas wreath off the door in anger at me and has blocked me leaving a room after pulling the duvet off me and not allowing me bed covers. He says he wanted me to know how it feels not to get your own way, as I'm utterly selfish and everything is all about me. 

I didn't see him all over Christmas because of the row etc and I honestly just didn't want to, but he messaged me constantly telling me how he was broken, I'd destroyed him etc. Christmas day he ended up going to the hospital because he was really ill with a chest infection and flu, he said he thought he should be in hospital but he has no family (one half sis in Australia  - parents had him as a teen pregnancy, he ended up in care then raised by grandparents so he has huge abandonment issues which I understand that my DA triggers) He has no friends at all in the area he's lived for about 15 years. He claims he gave them all up for me because he couldn't sustain friendships with his motorbike friends AND come see me. All I heard for a week was how ill he was, how miserable , how alone, how it was because of me etc. Meanwhile if I mention fucking cancer I'm using it as a shield, excuse or get out of jail free card. Yet it's utterly destroyed my confidence, body and mind, I've changed but he refuses to accept it. 

I've honestly tried to end the relationship so many times but it's like he has a hold over me and he just won't accept it, I always end up letting him back and hate it when he's here. I also worry he'll harm himself as he's threatened too multiple times, even going so far as to try to arrange a new home for the dog. 

When he's here, he's not going to sleep till late then sleeping in whilst I see to the dog and my cat and me then he wants breakfast, a shit and shower then lunch before he's even ready to start his day which just really doesn't work for me. I'm off work right now because of the cancer so my days are free but we need up wasting them. I do feel I talk bout how I feel but it's never deep enough. He says he needs to understand me but I live in my head.  

I used to enjoy my life and previous partners and I got along well most of the time. I was married for 10 years before he cheated. So my current partner believes lots of my issues are from that and I'm not used to him standing up to me because I've always picked weak men before who were likely DA too. 

I just don't know if me/the DA is really responsible for everything,I've been willing to change and work on my behaviour but when things go wrong or I mess up he tells me I'm not even trying. I'm just fed up of being told I'm needing to change yet him telling me he puts up with all my shit because I'm worth it when I'm 'nice'.  At this point I honestly crave being alone but I feel so guilty because everything bad about DA is so true for me and I constantly feel like a piece of shit whereas I thought I was pretty mentally stable up til recently. He constantly tells me what I do is abuse and tbh I'm scared he's right. 

I honestly don't know if I'm just a terrible person to him only because of DA, narcissism, emotional immaturity or if we just bring out the toxic side of each other. ",1,1736415565.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

1hx98jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1hx98jx/are_the_petty_bourgeoisie_worse_than_the/,Are the petty bourgeoisie worse than the bourgeoisie?,"Recently saw a post by this guy named Matt Bernstein who has some 3 million followers on instagram, post an image that seemed to mostly evoke progressive and pseudo revolutionary sentiments in people in the comments. (It was about how billionares are bad, how it's us vs them, you've probably seen it already) and of course, while this is not a bad thing (anything is better than nothing), I looked up Matt Bernstein's net worth. The guy makes 80k a month sharing posts about how the billionares have ruined the world and how we need to eat the rich. This guy has commodified activism and is profiting off of it. He just aligns himself with whatever the talking point of the nyc progressives is. If you really do wanna show solidarity with the working class, why not donate 80-90% of your earnings to the poor or homeless? Surely, even 10k/mo is a good enough income to live on. (I survive on 1200 a month). 

Many of my friends share his posts and agree with them. Many of my friends have rich parents. This has got me wondering, aren't these people worse for any potential change than the bourgeois at the top? People always seem to hate on Elon musk but surely, he's merely a product of capitalism? The small business owners, your local artist who charges you a ton of money for subpar art, the gallery owners, the bad slam poets at your local queer coffee shop... surely these people are just as bad? They too take part in large scale buying and selling of commodities to profit under a capitalist system?

A great example of this is Hasan Piker. Even though he commodifies outrage and anger and lives in a villa and (by his own admission) ""fucks models"", he's a champion of the far left. Why is grifting so popular? This whole thing just seems absurd to me. Is it just human nature?

tldr: too used to trading sex for quick cash, I just want some advice to stop. im tired and really dont want to do this anymore. 

hi! I wanna cut my story short so here are the important points 

- when I first used the website, the only intention I had was to get a free meal OR get like $100 from a pay per meet coffee date. absolutely nothing sexual.

- this guy offered me $1k for intimacy (sex). I was struggling financially so I told myself like whatever just kind of get it done and over with, treat it like a hook up and NEVER do it again. just walk away with $1k, and so I did. we did it at a hotel for about 30mins and bam $1k in my account. I wasn’t feeling great about using my body like that but I thought wow.. easy $. this arrangement with the same guy ended up for about 6months..

^ that was 2 years ago.
now fast forward to the year 2025, I have lost track of my body count.. I lost all self respect for my body and used it to get easy money because all it took was 30mins on average of my time. and I was okay with it. I always ask for at least $700 and they do give it to me. I only do it with guys who are tested clean and “nice”. I obviously don’t bang everyone I talked to. but I’ve probably did it with about 7 different guys now.

I have a job but the pay is shit. it’s 2025 now and I really want to get out of this lifestyle and have more respect for myself.. but I can’t seem to do it. anytime I need money, my first instinct is to go to sugarbook because guys there are down bad as hell and I know I could easily obtain $.

1hx94j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tjcrew/comments/1hx94j5/morning_crew_vent/,morning crew vent ,"i know in basically every industry ever, there’s a disparity with morning and night crews. nights don’t do mornings, mornings don’t do nights. both sides get used to their norm, yadda yadda. but i just gotta say, holey moley…at my store,  our morning crew is sooo entitled and coddled. it’s a reality: they are treated better than night and feel they deserve it. 

they literally wouldn’t handle what we at night do. our morning crew essentially get to jerk each other off to how good they are at opening every morning after they finish the pallets and don’t do shit afterwards. they never clean anything. never take out all of their trash (leave it full to the brim for night crew once we clock in). get more detailed and longer tastings when night gets one every blue moon. (ex. they get breakfast and coffee every morning and usually get to try 4-5 items and wine, night gets once box of hold the cone if we’re lucky ) and leave the remains in the break room to show yes, they had a tasting, and yes, we get to clean it all up for them. it’s such a slap to the face. 

they aren’t as friendly towards night crew when our times blend in the schedule cuz they think we don’t close well and are petty like that. (they won’t bag for night crew on reg only other morning members) 

and in the captains long they always get all the praise. there’s notes everyday of how well it all went and how perfect they are. ummm..you know why??? CUZ NIGHT DOES ALL THE HARD WORK FOR YOU. we all close so damn hard there’s nothing much for you do every morning. ofc it goes well. it’s disneyland for them i swear. that’s why they get better and longer tasting cuz they have so much time on their hands. and then complain if we missed putting up one box of salmon the night before. god forbid we forget fronts. do u ever have to take out trash?? clean ? work product and reg with customers around for your full shift ?? realize u never have to work as hard on ur section cuz…well …night will come in and fix it….im not closing!! they never need to truly rotate or care as hard cuz people are coming in after them to work it “better”. they try to hold day lockers by leaving water bottles and snacks. dishes to clean. 

we’re forced as night crew to do our best to make sure the store is in tip top shape to set up morning crew while never getting the returned favor. like it’s not a necessity to set up night crew nicely just cuz..?!? ughhh!!  i can’t stand them.  they’ve got some complex and think they’re all that. i think it’s also frustrating just cuz morning crews usually never budge cuz it’s usually capped veterans or people who have such fixed schedules. so even night crew wanting to transition to morning can’t. it’s pigeon held. besides the waking up early, mornings are easier and less work than nights. change. my. mind. i know im not alone. share ur thoughts below!!!

My partner has a work wife and it’s starting to get to me,"My (25f) partner (29m) works in sales. He unfortunately spent some time unemployed towards the start of our relationship due to layoffs and a competitive market, so I am proud of him and happy that he has been doing well at his job - he has been there for almost 2 years. 

He has a relatively small team of 5 people, aside from his director he is the only male in the group. Apparently 2 of the other girls have “formed an alliance” which has left him and one other female to become close friends. 

I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic, but here are a few things that are bothering me:

I found out a while ago that he drives her to places during work e.g. doctors appointments. 

They eat lunch together, get coffee, go shopping during lunch breaks every day they are in the office (hybrid work model). 

She vents to him about her boyfriend and the fights they have. Half the time it isn’t even venting - it’s talking down on her partner behind his back. This makes me wonder whether he vents about our relationship? 

I have seen a message to his friend where he refers to her as his “work wife”. 

There are other things and instances that bother me but these are just a few examples. 

I spoke to him recently and told him that the amount of time they spend together makes me uncomfortable and I don’t think she should be sharing intimate details about her relationship with him, getting lifts from him, etc. 

He told me that I have nothing to worry about and they are just work friends. He didn’t want to cut back on the time they spend together or make any compromise, this is basically my issue to deal with and I had to get over it. 

There is a work trip happening next week at a coastal town about an hour and 40 mins north of here. He mentioned it today over text how he was driving there and I asked him “you aren’t taking D, are you?” He said yes and tried to change the subject immediately. I told him that I didn’t like that he was doing that and he didn’t have anything to say in return. 

He isn’t taking anybody else with him, they are all making their own way up there, he is just driving with her up there and back home. 

They are staying in a hotel in separate rooms and spending their days at seminars and the evenings having dinner and drinking as a team. 

Am I overreacting by being unhappy with this whole arrangement? I understand that he needs friends especially at work, but I just don’t understand why he has a work wife who he has to be this close with? 

I’m upset because he didn’t mention it to me, wasn’t going to mention it to me, and when I asked him he didn’t want to discuss it. 

He cheated on me with a female friend 1.5 years ago after assuring me nothing had happened, so I’m finding it hard to believe him when he’s assuring me that “nothing is happening”. 

Usually we work through problems like this together but he seems to not care about how I feel with this one, and he is basically going to continue doing what he wants while I’m left to feel uncomfortable and upset.

Klappentext:  
Der Band lädt Leserinnen und Leser ein auf einen Rundgang durch den Exilwohnsitz der Familie Mann in Los Angeles, heute ein transatlantischer Debattenort der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.  
Beiträge namhafter Autorinnen und Autoren aus Literatur-, Geisteswissenschaften und Publizistik berichten vom politischen Leben der Manns in den USA und reflektieren drängende Fragen unserer Zeit. Inspiriert von den konkreten Räumen des im modernistischen Stil erbauten Hauses wird etwa die Auffahrt des Grundstücks zum Symbol für den Weg der Familie Mann nach Kalifornien – sowie für die Exilgemeinde im heutigen Los Angeles. Weitere Räume wie das Arbeitszimmer, die Küche oder der Garten bilden den Ausgangspunkt für sowohl historische Betrachtungen als auch für Überlegungen zu Gleichberechtigung, Überwindung von Rassismus, Klimawandel und anderen Themen der Gegenwart.  
Neben zahlreichen historischen Fotos ist das Buch mit exklusiven aktuellen Aufnahmen des renommierten Architekturfotografen Jean Molitor bebildert. So macht der Band einen Ort erfahrbar, dessen kulturelles, politisches und architektonisches Erbe bis heute seine Wirkung entfaltet.

Jutta Allmendinger über das Katia Mann House  
Gustavo Arellano über die kalifornische »Zufluchtsstadt« und ihre kulturelle Vielfalt

Es ist eine gute Mischung aus Text über Thomas Mann, Architektur, das (Exil-) in den 30ern und 40ern des letzten Jahrhunderts, aber auch die Brücke zum heute...sozusagen the good, the bad and the ugly und historischen und zeitgenössischen Fotos. Die 25 Essays spannen einen weiten Bogen, manche sind etwas weird to say the least, andere sehr bewegend oder informativ.  
Also ich nehme sehr viel mit aus diesem Buch, u.a. ein neues Interesse an den Manns und werden u.a. den Buddenbrooks dieses Jahr eine neue Chance geben.  
Aber: Einen Stern muss ich leider ganz brutal für das Format abziehen. Das Buch weiß nicht, was es sein will. Es ist sehr textlastig (was gut ist), hat aber das Format eines Bildbandes bzw. coffee table book. Das tut aber gar nicht Not, die Fotos bräuchten es gar nicht. Ja, es gibt zeitgenössische (prätentiöse) schwarz-weiß Fotografien von Jean Molitor (schwarz-weiß ist wohl sein Ding) und ästhetisch passt das natürlich in die Zeit von Thomas Mann in Los Angeles, aber für mich ist es doch primär ein Buch mit Texten zum lesen und ich glaube, die Fotos hätten auch in kleinerem Format gewirkt (sooooo herausragend sind sie nun auch nicht), aber es hätte mein rein technisches Lesevergnügen sehr erhöht. So kommt es einem vor, als sollten die 25 Essays nur Beiwerk sein. Also da hätte man einfallsreicher sein können, es muss ja nicht das Mini-Format vom Fischerverlag sein aber bis zum unhandlichen Bildband ist ja noch viel Luft.

Il consumo di caffè è una pratica diffusa e apprezzata in tutto il mondo, ma recenti studi suggeriscono che l'orario in cui viene consumato può influenzare la salute cardiovascolare. Secondo la ricerca, bere caffè nel pomeriggio o la sera potrebbe essere associato a un rischio maggiore di sviluppare malattie cardiovascolari, infarti e ictus.

#### Effetti del caffè

Il caffè contiene caffeina, un potente stimolante che può aumentare la pressione sanguigna e il battito cardiaco. Se consumato al mattino, quando il corpo è più attivo, i suoi effetti possono essere meno problematici. Tuttavia, bere caffè nel pomeriggio o la sera potrebbe interferire con il sonno e il recupero notturno, portando a un maggiore stress per il cuore.

#### Raccomandazioni

Gli esperti consigliano di limitare il consumo di caffè a prima di pranzo per ridurre i rischi associati. È importante ascoltare il proprio corpo e prestare attenzione a come il caffè influisce sulla propria salute. La moderazione rimane la chiave, e per chi è particolarmente sensibile alla caffeina, potrebbe essere utile considerare alternative più leggere.

In conclusione, sebbene il caffè possa avere benefici, è fondamentale considerare il momento della giornata in cui si decide di consumarlo, per proteggere la propria salute cardiovascolare.# 



## Heart and Coffee: Who Drinks It in the Afternoon or Evening Risks More

Coffee consumption is a widespread and appreciated practice around the world, but recent studies suggest that the time it is consumed can influence cardiovascular health. According to research, drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening may be associated with a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, heart attacks, and strokes.

#### Effects of Coffee

Coffee contains caffeine, a powerful stimulant that can increase blood pressure and heart rate. When consumed in the morning, when the body is more active, its effects may be less problematic. However, drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening might interfere with sleep and nighttime recovery, leading to increased stress on the heart.

#### Recommendations

Experts advise limiting coffee consumption to before lunch to reduce associated risks. It’s important to listen to your body and pay attention to how coffee affects your health. Moderation remains key, and for those particularly sensitive to caffeine, considering lighter alternatives may be beneficial.

In conclusion, while coffee may have benefits, it is essential to consider the time of day when deciding to consume it to protect cardiovascular health.",1,1736413666.0,viveresano,0,1.0,False
1hx8v6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1hx8v6m/dating_struggles/,Dating struggles ,"I’m seated in the office, sipping my coffee, and rethinking my life choices. I once dated a guy for almost four years, and during that entire time, he never complimented me, got me flowers, took me out on a date, or gave me any gifts. It wasn’t that he didn’t have money—he was working, and he often posted about the lavish parties he hosted at his apartment and the vacations he went on.

I even gave him gifts on his birthdays, hoping to drop a hint about what I wanted, but he never got the message. Let me just stop there before I start crying. One time, when I asked him to take me out, he took me to a club and bought a bottle of Viceroy without even a chaser. Mungu wangu, is this what life has come to?

I’d sometimes get jealous watching my colleagues receive thoughtful gifts, flowers, and surprises from their partners without even asking. Looking back, I think I gave too much of myself to someone who didn’t deserve it. I eventually broke up with him because it was clear the relationship was going nowhere.

Are there people in relationships like this? How do you even cope with such partners? And to the ladies with caring and thoughtful men—where exactly do you find them? Please, share the location so I can go shop for one!

For now, I’ll save the money I will buy myself  chocolates and plant my own flowers for Valentine’s. At least I can enjoy watching them grow while others enjoy their relationships solo.",28,1736413659.0,Kenya,35,1.0,False

After my last post about dopamine depletion resonated with so many of you, I wanted to share the practical steps that actually helped me rewire my brain. No theoretical fluff – just real, tested methods from someone who's been in the trenches.

Let me be real with you: implementing these changes wasn't smooth sailing. There were days I fell back into old patterns, moments of frustration, and times I questioned if it was worth it. But looking back now, these strategies fundamentally changed how I approach life and productivity.

Here's what actually worked for me:

* Morning Sanctuary: I replaced the instant phone grab with 30 minutes of peace. Just water, window gazing, and letting my mind settle. The first week was torture – my hand would literally twitch toward my phone. Now? It's the most peaceful part of my day. The urge to check notifications eventually fades, I promise.

* Movement Medicine: Skip the intense workout pressure. I discovered that simple movement – like walking without podcasts or dancing badly while making breakfast – gives me a more sustainable dopamine boost than endless doomless scrolling ever did. Your body literally rewards you for basic movement, no gym membership required.

* Real Connection Reset: Having coffee with friends, phones face-down, felt weirdly uncomfortable at first. Those silent moments where we'd usually hide in our screens? They turned into the deepest conversations I've had in years. The human connection hits different when you're fully present.

* Analog Joy: Found myself picking up origami (of all things). There's something deeply satisfying about creating something physical with your hands. Whether it's drawing, writing in a journal, or building something – tangible activities give you that dopamine hit without the digital drain.

* Single-Task Revolution: Turns out, my brain wasn't designed for constant task-switching. When I work, I just work. When I rest, I actually rest (revolutionary, I know). It felt impossible at first, but like training a puppy, my mind gradually learned to stay focused.

* Evening Rituals: Created a proper shutdown sequence for my day instead of streaming until my eyes blur. Sometimes it's reading an actual book, sometimes just sitting with my thoughts. My sleep quality skyrocketed, and morning-me is way less grumpy.

Here's the real talk: this isn't about becoming some digital monk or never enjoying Netflix again. I still use technology, but now I'm in control, not the other way around. Some days are better than others, and that's completely okay.

Remember, these changes took months, not days. Start small, be patient with yourself, and know that every tiny victory counts.

1hx8684,https://www.reddit.com/r/watford/comments/1hx8684/looking_for_dads_with_similar_interests_to_make/,Looking for dads with similar interests to make friends,"Hey everyone,

I am an Italian dad (38yo) from Leavesden looking for local dads to build some meaningful friendships.

Been here for 13 years and used to live in London prior.

Currently I struggle to make local friends or keep in touch with my friends as they are all from the depth of London.

I am a tad introverted so it is a bit harder for me than the average Joe to vibe with people.

I play guitar, bass and enjoying singing (all strong statements as I am an amateur) and love alternative music (punk, metal, etc), enjoy a little bit of gaming (mobile mostly) and watercolour painting.

I have two daughters aged 2 and 5.

My life currently is staling away due to ""all work no play"" divided into remote work, childcare, chores and family.

Since Covid this has taken the toll on my mental health and made me a bit of a eremit.

So I am looking for people to have some time outside home to give me (and especially my wife!) some quality time and make me less feral LOL

PM if you want to catch up for a chat, a beer, a coffee or to overthrow a government (I AM JOKING!)
