1kybrwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kybrwk/update_she_got_fired/,Update: She got Fired,"Hey Petty Potato. Get your pancakes out, cause I‚Äôve got an update for you all on the Autumn situation. 

She got fired.

So how did we get to this point finally? Well let me explain something‚Äôs that happened after our last meeting. 

I took the things that were said in that meeting and spoke with people who Autumn had specifically ‚Äúaccused‚Äù of either lying or spreading rumors about her. The problem with doing that is, all the people she mentioned including Tea and my own sister to name a few, are not known to do any of those things. 

Then the Clock Saga began. Autumn wanted to start using these specific clocks to tell people when coffee had been brewed. We usually use just a simple set of two cups that point to the time. This was something nobody cared about but Autumn made this the hill she wanted to die on. 

So for the last two weeks or so, there was a power struggle over these clocks. Hers would get moved or thrown away so she would retaliate and do the same to the cups. It finally came to a head on Memorial Day weekend. I came in on Monday and found a passive aggressive note in my desk about the clocks. 

My response was literally a ‚Äúwho the fuck cares about this?‚Äù Clearly, she did.

The next day I took the note to my bosses who literally said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs enough. This needs to stop. Maybe we should just fire her now to
Be done with this.‚Äù I wanted so badly to say ‚Äúyes please!‚Äù 

During that shift I happened to walk to a different unit to return some equipment and was greeted by some friends who work there. They asked me where I had been since they couldn‚Äôt stand working with Autumn. 

I asked what had happened and they told me. One incident, she threw a chart at a CNA who came to pick one up and was extremely rude about it. Another she threw an expensive piece of equipment in a box rather forcefully. She also had lied to one of the techs in unit when asking a question.

This might have been the final push that was needed to send things over the edge. I asked them if they could send an email of their experiences to my bosses. 

They said of course.

I talked with one of the bosses and asked if they had been informed of these incidents. She said no. I said well here‚Äôs a quick run down about them and that they would be receiving emails about it. 

I also had set up a meeting with the head of my department but that was set for Friday. I‚Äôm still going to
That meeting since I want to discuss some ideas on how to prevent this type of thing from happening again. 

I got a text this morning asking if I could come in to cover a shift and my sister texted me ‚ÄúThey fired Autumn.‚Äù

Well that is the end of the saga. It just shows that if you act poorly towards others, eventually justice will prevail.

A few days later on the drive back, I end up somehow on the same rural road and I drive past the diner, all boarded up and covered in weeds, I do a double take and it is sitting there abandoned, I drive back home and I wonder if this was a hallucination because I had been driving for hours and was tired or if I time travelled.

In the quest for sustained energy and alertness, many people find themselves torn between traditional coffee and newer alternatives like LbTonic. Both beverages offer unique benefits, but a key concern for many is the dreaded energy crash that often follows a caffeine rush. So, how does LbTonic compare to coffee when it comes to maintaining energy levels without the crash?

Coffee is a staple for many who seek an instant energy boost. It contains caffeine, which stimulates the central nervous system, increasing alertness and reducing fatigue. However, this is often followed by a sharp decline in energy as the effects wear off, leading to a common phenomenon known as the caffeine crash.

On the other hand, LbTonic is marketed as a natural energy booster that utilizes a blend of herbal ingredients designed to enhance focus and vitality without the jitters associated with coffee. Key ingredients often include adaptogens and nootropics, which may help balance energy levels and improve cognitive function without the subsequent crash.


Coffee: Quick energy boost, potential for crashes, contains high caffeine levels.
LbTonic: Gradual and sustained energy, fewer side effects, multiple herbal benefits.


When I switched from coffee to LbTonic, I noticed a marked difference in how my body reacted. While coffee would spike my energy levels, I often felt drained afterward. In contrast, LbTonic provided a more stable energy experience, allowing me to stay alert and focused without the infamous crash.

Ultimately, the choice between LbTonic and coffee boils down to personal preference and how your body responds to each. For those looking for consistent energy without the post-caffeine slump, LbTonic may be the superior choice.

I used to dread writing proposals, contracts, etc. Now I just give specific prompts and my docs write themselves.

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they‚Äôd stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.

Naturally, I asked, ‚ÄúWait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?‚Äù

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

> ‚ÄúGenerate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y ‚Äî include updated scope and pricing.‚Äù

And then just like that‚Ä¶ a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 

They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Now?

You can ask questions inside documents, like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs missing here?‚Äù 
Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates ‚Äî even PDFs
Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
Edit documents by prompting the AI like you‚Äôre chatting with a teammate
Turn any AI search result into a full professional document

It‚Äôs like Cursor for documents. having a smart assistant that understands your documents, legalities and builds new ones based on your real work history. 

The best part? It‚Äôs free. You can test it out for your next proposal, agreement, or internal doc and probably cut your writing time in half. (sharing the link in the comments)

Hello Victorians,

and a happy Thursday! Lino, Game Design Lead here, and talking to you today about Prestige Goods. Keep in mind that today is a public holiday in Sweden, so while I‚Äôll be around to answer some burning questions, more answers will have to wait until we‚Äôre officially back at work on Monday.

Prestige Goods are going to be part of *Charters of Commerce*, our upcoming Mechanics Pack which releases on June 17 alongside the free 1.9 Update.

Before we begin: As always, any values, texts, designs, graphics etc. are work in progress and are subject to change.

Well then, let‚Äôs take a look at Prestige Goods.

# Prestige Goods

Prestige Goods are a feature we have wanted to do for a while. In my internal pitch for Companies I had brought up a different variant of the feature already - at this point almost two years ago. So we are happy to be able to bring them to you now of course.

From this, you can tell already that there is a strong connection between Prestige Goods and Companies. In fact, Prestige Goods can only be produced by Companies. In some cases, they represent particular brands or products these Companies produced, in other cases they are more of a quality label for a type of product. At the end of this Dev Diary I am showcasing a couple of examples if you are curious.

Something worth noting is they are variants of existing goods, not new goods. For example Champagne is a Prestige Good variant of regular Wine. This has a couple of advantages, most importantly the performance is not nearly as affected by this as it would be if we introduced this large number of new goods. They are part of the same buy packages, serve as the same inputs and outputs as regular goods etc., with some differences which I‚Äôll go over later.

Additionally, there can be multiple Prestige Good variants of any given good, for example we are introducing three different Prestige silk versions.

So how are Prestige Goods produced?

# Production

Companies can only ever produce one Prestige Good type. A company that is prosperous will be able to produce their assigned Prestige Good.

You might be wondering: what makes certain Prestige Goods truly unique? Well, we made sure to include about 50 historical examples of goods and companies that were iconic for the era - keeping both immersion and replayability in mind.

For example the *Manufacture d'armes de Saint-√âtienne* Company in France will start producing the Prestige Good *Saint-Etienne Rifles* instead of regular small arms as soon as they hit the prosperity threshold. All company-owned building levels get the new blueprints and get to work on them, while all other weapon manufacturers in the country continue producing boring standard rifles. So while other companies around the world might be able to produce a generic Prestige Small Arms, there can be only one true producer of *Saint-Etienne Rifles*(TM)!

It doesn't necessarily mean that France has an exclusive right to that good - as country borders can always change.

[Unique icon showcasing the production of the new rifles has begun](https://preview.redd.it/zt7eau3qzp3f1.png?width=764&format=png&auto=webp&s=579e5d1543bb56215dd679dee0907ad4fd4dc1ee)

Once you have at least one Prestige Good variant of a good in the market, we need to show that somehow of course. For that, we can expand the entry of a good and show all Prestige Good variants of this good that are part of the market and can see how high their share is.

[Here‚Äôs an example for how this entry looks on the World Market, there‚Äôs a filter to disable the fold-out entries too](https://preview.redd.it/pe9hk41szp3f1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac8114490962203c0944b4f587017a04ff79b1dc)

While we wanted to make Prestige Goods somewhat special, we didn‚Äôt want to exclude all companies that lacked a good historical example. So, for all other companies that lack a historical Prestige Good, players will get a Journal Entry with the additional requirement of becoming one of the top three producers of the according good to start production of a ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù kind of Prestige Good, e.g. Prestige Cloth or Prestige Iron rather than a special name and look.

[It may not be Haute Couture, but Spanish fashion could still become a thing](https://preview.redd.it/ht192eptzp3f1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=2488761560148af375721f347eba86ef2d56c47c)

Now let‚Äôs look at the effects that Prestige Goods have when they are being produced and introduced into your market.

# Effects

The effects of Prestige Goods are manifold. In general one can say that they are more desired and of higher quality than their regular good counterparts and the higher the percentage of Prestige Goods, the better it is generally.

For one, of course Prestige Goods increase the prestige of the country where the producing company is located. This behaves like the top-producer Prestige gain for a regular good, but with a significantly higher bonus. So if you are the number one Prestige Wood producer, you can collect a nice Prestige bonus for example.

[‚ÄúThe French produce the best wine, clearly! And guns too.‚Äù](https://preview.redd.it/fdlr8w8wzp3f1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcc657b777efd05e258756f736ba8d3cce936f8)

On the World Market, Prestige Goods provide a trade advantage bonus based on the percentage of goods of that type that are Prestige Goods. This calculation is market area based, so for example if 50% of all iron in France is a form of Prestige Good iron, they receive 50 Trade advantage on exports from France for that particular Prestige Good. But if in one of their colonies the share of Prestige Good iron is only 25%, exports from that colony would only receive a 25% trade advantage bonus, without affecting the exports from France mainland itself.

[Note the +85.9 trade advantage from 85.9&#37; of all Small Arms production being a Prestige Good](https://preview.redd.it/eu3j2uvxzp3f1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6ffbe8b81ebae65bbafa92f6aaeeb0c983bd066)

Buildings consume Prestige Goods as input goods too. Based on the share of Prestige Goods, they are profiting from increased throughput.

[Prestigious Swedish Oregrounds Iron helps to increase the throughput of this Tooling Workshop](https://preview.redd.it/3or9cga00q3f1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=d157a88e670ddf5baff5d3d5b71a74bb57b477e9)

Now what would be the point of producing prestigious Saint-√âtienne Rifles if you couldn‚Äôt show them off on the battlefield too?

Prestige Goods also increase Offense, Defense and Morale recovery..

[They shoot extra accurate](https://preview.redd.it/tlc4laf10q3f1.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d60dd57858b5241d73df294d2435d7858fb89976)

Pops also heard about the new shiny Prestige Goods - and they want them. As you may know, goods that are consumed by Pops are organized in a couple of need categories, e.g. basic food or luxury drinks.

Within a category, Pops will consume more of a particular good depending how much of it is a Prestige Good. For example if you have a lot of Champagne, say 80% of all wine, but none of the other goods in the luxury drinks category has any Prestige Good, Pops will shift some of their spending from tea and coffee towards wine. If all goods were Prestige Goods, nothing would change about their spending.

Additionally, we also increase the chance of Pops getting obsessed with a particular good, increasing with the percentage of Prestige Goods variants of that good.

# Closing thoughts

Alright, that‚Äôs our walkthrough for the new Prestige Goods mechanic. I‚Äôd like to end today by showcasing some of the fantastic work that our 2D artists have done to make these new Prestige Goods shine.

I'm back with an update to the **Nuvio Streaming Addon** for Stremio.

After receiving feedback and working on improvements, I'm excited to announce **version 0.2.0**. This update includes several important features that should enhance reliability and performance for users willing to do a bit of extra configuration.

# What's New in v0.2.0:

* **Personal Cookie Configuration** \- You can now use your own cookie for one of the main providers, giving you dedicated bandwidth and no size restrictions
* **Two New Providers Added** \- Now supporting a total of four providers to improve content availability
* **Stream Size Management** \- Non-personalized users will see a file size cap on certain providers to avoid bandwidth exhaustion
* **Performance Optimizations** \- Various backend improvements for faster fetching and better reliability

# About this addon:

* **Multiple Providers** \- Now includes four providers (up from the previous two)
* **Content Availability** \- Attempts to find streams for movies and TV shows when available
* **High Quality Support** \- Some providers support 4K, HDR, HDR10+, and Dolby Vision content when available
* **Experimental Nature** \- This is a work in progress with no guarantee on how long it will last
* **Indie Development** \- As a solo developer, I'll try to fix or replace broken providers when I can
* **No Guarantees** \- Providers can change or disappear at any time without warning

**Disclaimer:** This addon is a personal project intended for educational purposes.

# Who's This For?

This addon is primarily for Stremio users who:

* **Prefer direct streaming links:** If you're looking for an alternative to debrid services and want to stream directly, Nuvio Streams attempts to provide that.
* **Understand the nature of scrapers:** As a scraper, this addon relies on the availability of public sources, which can be unreliable.

**Important Reminder:** While I strive to keep Nuvio Streams functional, there's **no guarantee that the addon or its sources will last long-term.** External provider sites can change or shut down without notice, which directly impacts the addon's ability to find streams.

# Personal Cookie Token Setup (Key New Feature)

A key new feature in v0.2.0 is the ability to use your own cookie for one of the main providers:

* **Why personalize?** Without personalization, you'll share limited bandwidth with other addon users and be restricted to smaller file sizes (under 9GB)
* **Benefits of personalization:** Your own dedicated 100GB monthly quota, faster speeds, and no file size restrictions
* **How to set it up:** Visit the addon's configuration page and follow the step-by-step instructions to get and set your own cookie

This feature is **Extremely Recommended** for the best experience, especially if you want access to larger, higher-quality streams including 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision content.

>**Future Notice:** Due to extremely limited resources, I plan to eventually transition this addon to only support personalized cookies. If the addon and providers are still operational in the coming months, non-personalized access will likely be phased out. I strongly encourage setting up your personal cookie now to ensure continued access.

# Where to find it:

# Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: What's the difference between personalized and non-personalized usage?**  
A: Non-personalized users share limited bandwidth and can only access streams under 9GB from certain providers. Personalized users get their own 100GB monthly quota and access to all quality levels.

**Q: Does this addon use torrents or P2P technology?**  
A: No. This addon only scrapes direct HTTP streams from websites. It does not use P2P or torrents.

**Q: Why do some streams not work?**  
A: Providers can change their websites or go offline at any time. When this happens, streams will stop working until I update the addon.

**Q: Can I contact you if I have issues with my personalized setup?**  
A: Yes! Comment below, or DM me.

**Q: How often is the addon updated?**  
A: As an indie developer with limited time, I update when I can. If a provider breaks, I'll try to fix it or find a replacement.

**Q: Will more providers be added?**  
A: I'm always looking for reliable providers to add. With this update, I've already added two new ones.

If you encounter issues, you can DM me or comment below. Please understand that it may take time to find solutions or alternative providers.

**Contributing to Development:**

The Nuvio Streams GitHub repository is currently private. However, if you're a developer interested in contributing to the project (e.g., by helping to fix providers, add new features, or improve the codebase), please send me a Direct Message (DM). If there's enough interest, I'm open to making the repository public to facilitate collaboration!

Gonna cry now.Moving sucks and I hate it. But thank the dark gods I'm done. Now my back and legs hurt and I'm gonna crash. So let's be bffs or enemies. So I'd be up to do the generic thing of swapping pet pics, talking about games or music, supervillain plans and all that jazz. My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting someone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. Playing the new Doom. Sad that Super Earth fell to the vile illuminate. 

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad bod. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.

Ive been with her now 1,5 years. We met at work where im not anymore from another reasons. First months were so great, she was constantly calling me and put text and wanted to spend all the time with me. But I think allready after couple months when she left example at weekend to some event or trip with her friends, she didnt even say nothing from it to me, maybe just day before. I had 2 long relationships before this and I think In those relationships if other had some plans we discussed it much more before. 
When she was on these trips it felt that she didnt put me any text or phone calls or anything and when I asked her something she answer just with couple words and nothing more. 
At our first couple months she also talk A Lot about some guys and relationships and what she has done In her trips and nightouts and for me it felt  uncomfortable becouse I started to think that she is cheating me becouse she felt so cold everytime she was somewhere. 

Month ago she left to another city without telling me anything, she was there one week and put me In block. After when she came back she came to see me and was saying that it was hard to be there and she loves me. 

Last weekend she was in A trip again and send me some party images and allmost nothing more. When she came back and heard that I was partying with my friends she was worried that I was cheating her and asked every name Who I was with. 

She can say that shes just going for A cup of coffee with her friend and stay there like all day. 

Now last months she has dumped me many times at best In A week, one day she can left me and say that she hates me and every other day she loves me and wants A child and future with me. Im starting to lose my mind. I havent even seen her parents one time, she told me that she doesnt want them to see me becouse she isnt sure about me. It hurts me. 

It feels she doesnt do anything wrong with her things and at the end it has to allways be me who says sorry. 

Im so sorry if this is wrong subreddit, but it feels she can be so cold and distant sometimes and I feel so lonely. I have used alcohol A Lot becouse it feels its the  only thing that I can forgot about her. 

I have talked about this with my two female friends and they told that maybe shes having some affairs and has some narsistic features becouse she is so controlling and jealous about me even though she knows I dont go to any clubs and mostly be just home. I dont really see even friends often. 
One time she also went to my computer when I was at work and saw pictures from my ex, she got super mad about it and wanted to see that I delete them. I said to her that would it be ok to her that I watched her phone without askin her and I didnt get allmost no answer.

Boomer Wisdom at work this morning.

I've been with this second-generation, family-run HVAC-R company in the Northeast for six years now. It's a great place overall, but I have learned my values tend to clash with most of my older colleagues (I'm 38, one of the younger folks in a company where people tend to stay for life).

Every Thursday, we have bagels in the office kitchen, and it's usually a casual gathering spot. This morning, I grabbed my coffee and a bagel, and walked into a conversation between Leonard (a coworker around my parents' age whom I work with fairly often) and someone else. I usually keep to myself, but then Leonard turned to me and dropped this gem: ""I was just telling Evelyn about my trans son who doesn't talk to me.""

My immediate thought was, ""Oh, hmm."" I really didn't want to engage, but he kept going.

""Yeah, he did call me last week and asked me for $40. I sent him $50 and told him not to ask for anything again until he decides to have a relationship with me. It's like I lost a son,"" he lamented.

It was way too early for this emotional gymnastics. I tried a subtle correction: ""I'm sure *she* wishes things had turned out differently, too.""

Leonard, completely unfazed (or just not caring), plowed ahead: ""And *he* was such a liar as a child. *He* is such a disappointment. Well, enjoy the day!""

I just stood there, pouring my coffee, utterly stunned. His blatant denial of his own child's identity was astonishing. I couldn't even muster a response.",3,1748527088.0,BoomersBeingFools,1,1.0,False

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they‚Äôd stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.

Naturally, I asked, ‚ÄúWait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?‚Äù

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

> ‚ÄúGenerate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y ‚Äî include updated scope and pricing.‚Äù

And then just like that‚Ä¶ a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates. 

They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Now?

You can ask questions inside documents, like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs missing here?‚Äù 
Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates ‚Äî even PDFs
Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
Edit documents by prompting the AI like you‚Äôre chatting with a teammate
Turn any AI search result into a full professional document

It‚Äôs like Cursor for documents. having a smart assistant that understands your documents, legalities and builds new ones based on your real work history. 

The best part? It‚Äôs free. You can test it out for your next proposal, agreement, or internal doc and probably cut your writing time in half. (sharing the link in the comments) 

While I am using it currently, if you know of any similar AI tools, let me know in the comments.

I‚Äôve tried getting into exercise, but after just 5‚Äì10 minutes, my heart rate gets so high that I get scared something might happen and I stop.   
  
The doctor ordered an ECG and a blood test to check things out. And after seeing the results said that I don't have anything too out of ordinary. I just need to sleep better, reduce caffeine, and lower my sugar intake.   
  
For context: I don‚Äôt smoke, I drink one cup of coffee each morning, and I live a pretty sedentary lifestyle (I work remotely and don‚Äôt exercise regularly). I‚Äôm 178 cm (5'10"") and weigh 90 kg (about 200 lbs).

After coming home and looking at my results, I saw that my LDL cholesterol is way above the ordinary levels and got very surprised that the doctor didn't even mention it. Here are my results:

We‚Äôve just been talking on Snapchat, maybe talking once or twice a day. Was just casual talk and getting to know each other as friends. I wasn‚Äôt really into him since he lived about 2-3 hours away from me, I didn‚Äôt know him that well, and we just sent snaps back and forth so it was nothing serious. Well he decided he wanted to come drive over to my town for memorial weekend. He was making a whole list of plans, wanting to do 6 or 7 things in one whole day and hang out 3 days in a row with tons of plans. It was just freaking me out and felt like I was being pushed to hang out with him and that he was coming to just see me. It just didn‚Äôt feel right for some reason. He also wanted to get an Airbnb, drive in the car with him, etc. and I‚Äôm not comfortable at all being alone with a stranger, someone I‚Äôve never even met before so I said no and I think he was getting upset over that. Anyways I agreed to get coffee when he got here to see how the vibes were and see if there was something there. He was pretty chill and talked a bit. I felt like I was making all the conversation, it was pretty awkward. But he wanted to hang out the next day and do some of the things he had planned. So I agreed to see how it would go, see if anything changes. So we had breakfast, went to the park, ate out, etc. but just the whole time I felt like I was obligated to hang out with him, like things were forced. I was trying to change the plans so that I could be alone and get away from him for a while to think about him and this situation‚Ä¶ i said I needed to do some chores before we went to the next thing he had planned, but he kept being persistent on hanging out and him wanting to go to my house to help me with my chores, or pick me up when I‚Äôm done‚Ä¶ so I just had to lie even more so I could just be alone. He bought me flowers, taking me out to eat (I kept offering to pay for our food too but he kept saying no), he was doing all these nice things but I just couldn‚Äôt feel the connection. I also felt I was making all the conversation and it was just awkward the whole time. When I tried to get out of our last date of the day He stated ‚Äúwell I came all this way for you and I planned this whole trip for you‚Äù it just made me feel uneasy. He has his friends and parents here in my town.. and he couldn‚Äôt just make plans with them? The whole date just felt forced. I felt so bad because he came all this way but I really just wasn‚Äôt feeling it. I used to not listen to my body and mind about how I‚Äôm feeling about someone but now I do and I have to act on it! The next day was his birthday he had some things planned he wanted to do with me and he was calling me non stop and texting me a bunch and I just couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore‚Ä¶ So I told him I don‚Äôt see us being more than friends, you‚Äôre an amazing guy and I hope you find the right one for you. There‚Äôs more to that but I was trying to be as nice as possible to this guy. Before our hangout he even said ‚ÄúI have no expectations for this date, we are just gonna hangout and see if we vibe‚Äù and so I thought it was chill!! But then he said this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very impressed by your masking ability that was some high level manipulation! You put on such a great show :) I was convinced that we had a genuine connection the whole time! So much time and effort for what? To be rejected and drive home on my b day, then never hear from you again. All I‚Äôve got to say is I‚Äôve learned a lot, thank you for all of the valuable lessons you‚Äôve taught me about trust and consideration. I will not be making that mistake ever again :) I don‚Äôt understand your intentions or motives but I guess that was the point. I do hope you have a fantastic life and find whatever it is you‚Äôre looking for. I don‚Äôt regret any of it. Goodbye.‚Äù I was pretty shocked when he said that. It was our first time meeting and we barely talked before meeting. I feel like he took it badly and I just feel so bad, I didn‚Äôt mean to hurt him or cause trouble. I was just saying how I felt‚Ä¶ Would it be better if I just lie and ghost you?? I‚Äôm not that type of person. But AITAH for this?? ",0,1748526541.0,AITAH,2,0.5,False
1kyb9ng,https://www.reddit.com/r/etiquette/comments/1kyb9ng/siblings_and_sharing_expenses/,Siblings and sharing expenses,"My sisters-in-law frequently visit their parents home. They stay over at least 3-4x/month and my husband and I share a bathroom with them. I have known this family for 10 years and the bathroom has old, gross products from when my husband and I started dating 10 years ago! The bathroom is cleaned regularly, however, it still grosses me out, because it‚Äôs just unkempt, unorganized and I recently found nail clippings next to a nail clipper on the shower organizer. 

My husband and I will need to stay the night at my in laws a few times this summer. I would really like to buy my own nice bath products and leave them there so I don‚Äôt have to lug them back and forth, however, with the frequency my sisters-in-law stay, I feel like the products will be used up very quickly. These sisters love expensive products (I mean who doesn‚Äôt?) I just don‚Äôt understand how they are showering with the gross stuff that‚Äôs currently in there. 

This also gets into the topic of coffee. The sisters usually drink tea while there, however, I need my cup of coffee. So when we stay over, we end up buying coffee for everyone (sometimes their dad pays for it). I don‚Äôt mind getting a coffee maker and coffee, however, once again, why am I footing the bill for this?

Gonna cry now.Moving sucks and I hate it. But thank the dark gods I'm done. Now my back and legs hurt and I'm gonna crash. So let's be bffs or enemies. So I'd be up to do the generic thing of swapping pet pics, talking about games or music, supervillain plans and all that jazz. My sleep is messed up so if you're wanting someone to chat all night and day with that's me.

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. Playing the new Doom. Sad that Super Earth fell to the vile illuminate. 

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Hmm how I would describe myself? Black hair. Beard. Brown eyes. Dad bod. Hairy. I've been told I had nice eye lashes.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.

There are only 16 items on it because 1) we prefer (and encourage) cash gifts and 2) I‚Äôm not having a shower. 

{{ i am not having a shower because 1) don‚Äôt want to plan it and pay for it 2) don‚Äôt want guests to feel obligated to travel for it and travel again for my wedding 3) my fianc√©e and I have each lived alone before so we already have two of every appliance and two sets of everything. We have more dishes and toasters and crockpots and coffee makers than we possibly could use. }}


Recently had friends and family say the following:
1. I need to ‚Äúredo‚Äù my registry
2. There isn‚Äôt enough on it
3. The stuff on it is too basic
4. Small household items on my registry make my guests feel like I want them to do my grocery shopping


I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I assumed most guests wouldn‚Äôt even look at my registry because people tend to give cash and because I‚Äôm not having a shower. I‚Äôve paged through hundreds of webpages suggesting items to add to my registry and there truly is nothing else that we need or even want at the moment. We want to buy a house in the near future so we really just want to receive and save money. And like I said we have two of everything already an not enough room in the apartment the way it is. And honestly, if my guests would do my grocery shopping for me for a week or help replenish small household items that I need, that‚Äôs the best gift ever IMO. Anything that would A) save me time or B) pay for something that I would‚Äôve had to spend money on anyways, is the best type of gift. So yes, sponges and windex and tide pods are GREAT gifts for me. My guests don‚Äôt seem to think so. But shouldn‚Äôt they want to get me the gift that is best or most helpful for my situation? 

Is putting small household items on my list bad etiquette? Is 16 items too few for a registry (for a wedding with no shower)? Have any of you experienced registry criticism? ",2,1748526441.0,weddingplanning,13,0.75,False

Basics is he a great, great friend/father/ housemate, but a terrible husband. Always respectful, always worked hard and provided for us. If dinner isn‚Äôt made or chores haven‚Äôt been done throughout the day by me, he will come through the door from work and just help, no questions asked. He‚Äôs easy going, and we don‚Äôt really argue. His absolute MUST in a relationship is loyalty. 
Now, the bad bits. 
For last maybe 5years ish. Our daily routine is this‚Ä¶ he comes home from work 5.30pm‚Ä¶ gets changed, normally I have dinner ready or within 20/30mins, he will offer to help if needed. We eat, after food, about 6.30/6.45 ish, he will sit on sofa playing on his phone, and tell me if somethings happened in work, and/or ask how my day has been etc. 7.30pm he and he‚Äôs moves to his console, headset on, whilst checking out any game info online on his fone.
I sit and watch tv until about 8.30pm, and then i go to bed to watch tv, because I‚Äôm fed up of sitting there with him focused on the console/phone etc, so I leave him to it. When he finishes doing his consolingly, he grabs the quilt (that is kept downstairs for him) and then he sleeps on sofa. 
Now our morning routine, we get up, (he has his alarm, I have mine). He religiously makes me my first couple of coffee‚Äôs in the morning, he will ask if I‚Äôm working, shift time etc, wish me a lovely day if it‚Äôs my day off, kiss me on the cheek, and go to work. 
He doesn‚Äôt ever randomly tell me he loves me, doesn‚Äôt show me any affection, no coming behind me to put his arms around me, no kissing apart from that morning goodbye kiss on my cheek. Not words of affirmation, no compliments, nothing.We barely have sex, and it‚Äôs always even from the beginning of our relationship been initiated by me (always been receptive) Now all this used to irritate me, make me sad/lonely/angry literally daily, I‚Äôd be sat there watching his on his console, thinking what am I doing with this man‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd go to bed, to avoid sitting in that space with him, because I was so hurt.
I did numerous times bring it up when I was at breaking point, told him I was unhappy, things need to change, I feel like we are housemates not husband and wife etc. Each conversation was incredibly difficult for me, because he literally listened but didn‚Äôt contribute anything towards the conversations. To put it bluntly, each time I came away feeling like a head teacher who was telling a child off‚Ä¶ yes, no, and silence while I spoke. 2/3years ago, I warned if things don‚Äôt improve, I will divorce once our daughter finishes her GCSE‚Äôs (which she is currently sitting now) She suffers really badly with anxiety, during exams. 
I have over the years, tried to improve things between us, valentines I bought sexy underwear (which was the last time we had sex) prior to that would have been months, again that‚Äôd have been because of some effort on my side. Nights out together, days out, holidays, all arranged by me. He‚Äôs never once suggested cinema, date night, he‚Äôs basically never done anything to try and fix things. I genuinely think he‚Äôs happy with the way things are. 

In the last 2years, (since a severely disabled family member who I cared for virtually 24/7 for 8years passed away) I‚Äôve made a lot of changes to my life, after spending so many years prioritising others. I‚Äôve lost over 7 stone in weight (had a health scare) went back into full time employment, had a new hair do, and honestly felt better in myself than I ever has. I had a job that made me, not mum, not carer, not wife.., just me. So all the problems with my husband, I started to care less and less about. Didn‚Äôt care if he was on his computer, didn‚Äôt care if we didn‚Äôt kiss, basically I started separating myself from him, waiting for daughters exams to come, basically it seems I was preparing myself to leave him. 
I had to leave that job few months back, as another family member has been diagnosed with a severe type of cancer, requiring a lot of help (he has 2 stoma‚Äôs) still in active treatment and my previous job‚Äôs hours weren‚Äôt compatible with helping him. So now I have a little part time one I‚Äôm happy with. In my previous job, I became close to all my colleagues, (98% of the work force was male). A new male colleague and I hit it off straight away, he was kind, asked how I was, always saying lovely things, cwtching me. I knew he would have liked it to become romantic (he never said, it was obvious to me and our other colleagues) It was never in my mind to have overstepped that boundary though. (Infact I was not even attracted to him) I‚Äôd never cheat, no matter how unhappy I was in my marriage. But, I didn‚Äôt discourage his sweet gestures, cute compliments, lush txt messages. 
Infact, I relished in them. 
My husband  was doing nothing. But I had this sweetheart, who literally said the sweetest things ever to me, (Always with other staff there, we worked in different departments so we only ever seen each other in the canteen, I was never alone with this colleague, never met him outside work)
Yesterday, his partner has messaged me about us having an affair. Which we haven‚Äôt. She‚Äôd seen the WhatsApp messages he sent me (maybe 10 total) nothing inappropriate, just so sad you‚Äôve left, missing you beautiful, that sort of thing. Her message to me, included a screenshot shot of a message she has sent to my husband saying we have/having an affair. She‚Äôs obviously spoken to her partner, who has told her nothing has happened between us, and we were just good friends, and he repeated to her I was married, but we don‚Äôt sleep together and I‚Äôm waiting for my daughters exams to leave him, basically he told her, look she‚Äôs having a hard time is her marriage etc, so he was very a shoulder to cry on. She repeated the lot in that message.
Husband comes home from work last night, acting different. Extra chatty, and lots of ‚Äòbabe‚Äô after asking me something. I literally just sat there, waiting for him to say something, he doesn‚Äôt mention anything. Doesn‚Äôt go on console, sits on sofa trying to engage in conversation about everything and anything with me. 
I found the whole thing uncomfortable, so an answered politely, and went to bed.
What is going on? why hasn‚Äôt he brought this up? I genuinely believe that he knows I wouldn‚Äôt cheat‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt understand why he hasn‚Äôt said anything?",2,1748526192.0,Marriage,18,0.63,False

1kyb3j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1kyb3j1/my_firsttime_colonoscopy_experience/,My first-time colonoscopy experience,"This group was so supportive and helpful as I navigated my first colonoscopy. I wanted to pass along my experience for any new folks going through a colonoscopy for the first time. 

1. Speak up and advocate for yourself when you think something is ""off"" with your health. Even something minor. Document any symptoms and when you first noticed them. I had severe constipation and thinning stools. I've also had persistent pain in my abdomen that has increased in frequency and severity. 
2. When your colonoscopy is scheduled, ask all of the questions. Even if you think they are silly. What can I eat before and after? What if I can't finish the prep? Do I have to finish the prep? (answer to that last one is Yes, you always have to finish the prep - follow the doctors instructions). What are concerns I should watch for? Who can I call if I have questions - what if it's a weekend or holiday, how do I get a hold of someone?
3. Read through instructions at least 2 weeks before to prepare. If you don't have instructions then this is a great time to reach out and get those. Take notes and set reminders. I have ADHD and I had to write out exact time and instructions on my wall calendar, phone calendar, paper on my fridge. I set alarms on my phone to remind me. If something doesn't make sense call to clarify. 
4. For severe constipation: I was put on a two-day prep. 3 days before the procedure I was to start a low-fiber diet. I actually started the low fiber diet 5 days before the procedure. For breakfast I ate eggs, white toast, egg ham and cheese sandwiches, yogurt, cottage cheese, corn flakes cereal; For lunch I ate ham sandwiches, cheese, hard boiled eggs, white pasta with cheese and garlic, applesauce; For dinner I  ate a variation of mashed potatoes (no skin), white rice, white pasta with chicken, fish, shrimp, tuna sandwiches. I was very confused about the low-fiber diet helping but I learned that it's because high-fiber foods stay in your system longer and are tougher to push out. Ironically enough - my preferred high-fiber diet was said to be the cause of my constipation...
5. Clear Liquid Diet: I started on liquid diet 2 days before my procedure. I was very worried about this because I have POTS and I also have 2 young kids to take care of. I was nervous about the lack of energy and the dizziness. I sustained on black coffee, Gatorade (clear, regular sugar), sipped on 4 cups of chicken broth for lunch, and Jell-O (lime) for dinner. I'm not a sweets fan but I considered Italian ice but the store I went to didn't have any clear (lemon, lime). My doctor advised I get glucose tabs to help with my sugar dropping but I think between the Gatorade and the Jell-O I didn't need them. I also got Pedialyte. 
6. I was placed on a split prep of Magnesium Citrate and Gavilyte-C. 2 days before the procedure, 3 hours after I started on the liquid diet I drank the full Magnesium Citrate bottle. They gave me cherry flavor. I mixed it with an apple Spindrift (bubbly water drink) and it was actually not bad at all. I drank it through a straw and I didn't mind it. There was a delayed reaction...took about an hour after I was done for everything to start coming out. The coming out was actually not bad. It's not like pooping when you're sick. It was just like peeing out of my butt. I did buy butt cream and applied whenever I had a ""break"". I also got very soft toilet paper. At the end of it I never felt my butt burn or any discomfort. The day before the procedure I started the Gavilyte-C. They gave me the lemon flavoring packet. I didn't mind the taste at all either. It was actually really refreshing as I placed it in the fridge. BUT the large amount of liquid was just too much. I did start to gag halfway through. It was just too much liquid to drink. I was supposed to drink 3/4th of the jug within 2 hours and it took me 3 hours. Between the large amount to drink and immediately having to be in the bathroom it was tough for me to finish it in time and it was fine. I had to drink the remaining 4th at 1am the day of the procedure. I set an alarm and that final amount was fine. I had nothing left in my by that point. I was able to get an hour of sleep by my 7am procedure. 
7. I had to take a Lyft to my procedure and I scheduled that ahead of time. I was pooping up until 30 minutes before they arrived but it was fine. Poop by that point was very clear-yellow with some orange flakes. I was worried about having to go during the drive and when I got there but it was fine. I got an ""excellent"" in my summary for the quality of my bowel prep. 
8. Once in the procedure I changed into a gown, I asked for 3 warm blankets, and they placed an IV. I spoke with the nurse, doctor, and anesthesiologist. They wheeled me to the prep room. They did their ""time-out"" and they told me to turn to my left side and they let me know they were adding the Propofol. My friends told me to think of something happy as that's happening. I did feel an immediate headache before going under. 
9. I was awakened and wheeled to my post-op room. This is the only part that I'm a little uncertain about. I remember being awoken a bit aggressively. I remember someone grabbing me from my jaw and saying my name and the first thing I thought when I woke up is how painful their finger was jamming into the side of my face/jaw. It's not sitting well with me. 
10. I thought I would be starving after but I wasn't too hungry. They gave me peanut butter crackers and wheeled me to the car and when I got home I napped for 3 hours. They said no spicy or fried food 24 hours following the procedure. I went to work fine the next day, although the sedation caused a bit of a headache that lingered to the next day, but nothing major. 

They ended up finding no Polyps and everything looked reassuring. They attributed my constipation and thinning stools to my high-fiber diet and hemorrhoids. Told me to return again in 10 years. Results were reassuring and I'd have to start screening in 7 years anyways so I'm glad to get it over with. A bit frustrating that nothing was found to explain the pain 2 inches from my belly button that persists. ",1,1748526092.0,colonoscopy,1,1.0,False

We broke before colege, but remained really good friends. I stayed in our hometown and he went to colege abroad. But sometimes, when he came to visit his family, we would go for a coffee and talk. The love and chemistry remain and, very rarely, we would go to my place to .... you know üòè
The last time he came home, we could no longer ignore how we are meant for each other and decided to give long distance a try (3-4 hours plane + bus).
But he has some mental health issues (depression and self-sabotage), and thinks he's going to hurt himself and me more. I'm always reassuring him that everything is going to be fine, but out off nowhere, he sends me a message at 4am just saying: ""I'm sorry, but I'am not ok"" and blocked me on everything (socials and my number). I even call his work and a coworker told me he couldn't talk. I try email, but nothing. 
I know his not ok and that he loves me sooo much, but I don't know how to convince him that we can work out and our long distance is not for long. Because when we are together in person, all his insecurities go away and his happy.
I booked a flight in a week, on my vacation, to go see him. Even though I only know where he works but not where he lives (I never ask the exact address, I just know the region) or his work schedule. I'm afraid that, when I arrive, his on his day off and I have to book a room and spend alot of money. Or if I find him and hi breaks up with me for real, in person. I know that, if I find him, he will offer me a room to sleep.

Any type of advice is welcome, I just wouldn't need the ""you should break"" ones please. Also, advise from guys who can relate to him, would help alot.

1kyb0hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kyb0hh/i_took_my_friend_to_the_er_late_at_night_i_dont/,I took my friend to the ER late at night... I don‚Äôt think we were in the real Hospital anymore,"It was past midnight when Chris and I left the old 24-hour diner at the edge of town. We had spent the evening catching up over burgers and coffee, talking about high school memories and future plans that would likely never materialize.

As we strolled toward my car parked a little further down the block, Chris slowed his pace. I glanced over and noticed him rubbing his temples. He was pale.

""Everything okay, man?"" I asked, half-jokingly. ""Too much greasy diner food?""

Chris shook his head, wincing as he leaned against a nearby lamppost. ""No, it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ different,"" he mumbled. ""Everything's spinning."" He grimaced, clutching his stomach as he swayed on his feet.

I rushed over and grabbed him by the arm just as his legs gave out. His breathing was ragged, each breath shallow and strained. A jolt of panic shot through me. I wasn‚Äôt sure what was happening, but it was more than just a bad burger.

""Come on,"" I said, guiding him toward the car. ""We need to get you to the hospital.""

We barely made it to the passenger seat before he collapsed completely. I managed to push him inside, buckling his seatbelt as his head lolled against the window. His breathing had grown faint, his skin cold. I didn‚Äôt waste any more time. I jumped into the driver‚Äôs seat and sped toward the hospital. The roads were empty, the entire town blanketed in a pale bluish light that made everything look strangely surreal.

When the hospital finally came into view, I pulled up to the emergency entrance and skidded to a stop. The automatic doors slid open with a soft hiss, and I half-dragged, half-carried Chris inside. The bright fluorescent lights inside the emergency room burned my eyes as I shouted for help.

A nurse and a security guard rushed over immediately. Chris was placed on a gurney and whisked away into a triage room. I tried to follow, but the nurse held up a hand. ""You need to stay in the waiting room, sir. Someone will come speak to you soon.""

Reluctantly, I turned back and made my way into the waiting room. It was a small, uninviting space lined with rows of faded plastic chairs. The harsh lighting overhead buzzed like a hive of angry bees, casting a cold, sterile glow over everything. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic, with a hint of something stale, like old coffee or cheap hospital food.

The reception desk sat at the far end of the room, cluttered with stacks of paperwork and a dusty computer monitor. Behind the desk, a tired-looking receptionist typed away with little enthusiasm, barely glancing up as I entered. She looked like she had been working the night shift for years, with deep shadows under her eyes and a weary slump in her posture. A glass partition separated her from the waiting area, with a small sliding window used to speak to patients.

Aside from the receptionist, there were only a few other people scattered around the room. A middle-aged man in a wrinkled jacket sat slumped in a chair, staring blankly at the floor tiles, his face pale and drawn. Across from him, a young woman scrolled through her phone, her foot tapping rhythmically against the leg of the chair. In the far corner, an elderly woman with a hunched back knitted quietly, her lips moving as she murmured to herself, though I couldn‚Äôt make out the words.

The wall-mounted TV flickered above, showing a muted news broadcast with closed captions scrolling across the screen. Next to it, a clock ticked irregularly, the second hand jerking with each movement as though struggling to keep time. The room itself seemed caught in some liminal state.

I chose a seat near the corner, trying to calm my breathing. My heart was still racing from the rush to the hospital.

The seat beneath me was stiff and uncomfortable, offering little relief from the tension gripping my body. I shifted, trying to find a better position, when I felt something crinkle under my leg. Frowning, I reached down and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper that had been wedged into the chair. It was old and yellowed at the edges, like it had been left there for a while.

Curious, I unfolded the paper and smoothed it out on my lap. The handwriting was rushed, uneven, as if whoever wrote it had been in a hurry, or panicked. The list was numbered, and as I began to read, I couldn't help but feel a mix of surprise and amusement at what was written there.

Rule 1. ""Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.""

I raised an eyebrow. That seemed oddly specific. Why would anyone write something like that? I glanced over at the receptionist, who was still tapping away at her keyboard, oblivious to the rest of the room. Was this some kind of prank? The idea made me smirk a little, despite the heaviness in the air.

Rule 2. ""Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM.""

I let out a short, dry laugh. ""So I‚Äôm supposed to be polite now?"" I muttered under my breath, shaking my head. It was all so ridiculous. Maybe someone had written this as a joke to mess with the people stuck here at odd hours, bored out of their minds. I could imagine some bored night-shifter scribbling out these 'rules' as a way to pass the time.

Rule 3. ""If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.""

I paused. That one was‚Ä¶ strange. It carried a different weight compared to the others. Who wouldn‚Äôt help someone lost in a hospital, of all places?

Rule 4. ""If you hear your friend‚Äôs voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.""

The amusement drained from my expression. I felt a chill run up my spine, as if the temperature in the room had just dropped a few degrees. I glanced toward the dimly lit hallway that led to the ER rooms. It seemed to stretch into darkness. I shook my head, pushing the thought away. This list was just some random nonsense‚Ä¶ wasn't it?

I continued reading, my curiosity now tinged with unease.

Rule 5. ""If a power outage occurs, stay seated and do not move.""

Rule 6. ""If a door that should be locked is found open, close it immediately and do not look inside.""

The hairs on the back of my neck prickled. I couldn‚Äôt explain why, but each rule seemed to grow darker, more foreboding as I read on. It wasn‚Äôt just the content of the rules, it was the way they were written, as if someone were trying to warn me.

Rule 7. ""Do not look through the glass doors leading to the courtyard after 4:00 AM.""

Rule 8. ""If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.""

That one made me swallow hard. There was something inherently unsettling about the thought of a chill creeping up on you from behind, and not being able to turn around to see what, or who might be there. I couldn't help but glance behind me, but there was nothing there. Just the same sterile room, with its faded chairs and buzzing lights.

I reached the last rule, and for some reason, my heart beat a little faster.

Rule 9. ""If a security guard tells you it‚Äôs time to leave, check the clock before listening. It's safe to leave after 6:00 AM.""

My gaze flicked up to the wall-mounted clock, its second hand twitching with every tick. It read 1:30 AM.

At the bottom of the paper, written in shaky red ink, were the words: ""Trust me. I learned the hard way.""

There was a dark, crusted stain on the corner, one that looked disturbingly like dried blood. The sight of it made my stomach twist. I rubbed my fingers over the words, feeling the rough texture of the ink beneath my skin.

I couldn‚Äôt help but let out a short, nervous laugh. ""What kind of place is this?"" I whispered to myself.

I slumped back in the chair. It was hard to shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, but I forced myself to dismiss it as a weird prank. The list couldn‚Äôt actually mean anything, just someone‚Äôs twisted idea of a joke. I leaned my head back against the wall and closed my eyes, trying to calm my thoughts. A part of me couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about Chris and the way he had collapsed in the parking lot.

The quiet hum of the waiting room wrapped itself around me, making the place feel even more isolating. That‚Äôs when I heard it. My name, spoken in a low, barely audible voice that seemed to drift down the hallway. ""Adam‚Ä¶ Adam...""

My eyes shot open, and my body tensed. The voice was unmistakable, it was Chris. I jerked my head towards the corridor leading to the ER rooms, but there was no one in sight, just the pale overhead lights flickering. The voice came again, a little louder this time. ""Adam, help me‚Ä¶""

I jumped up from the chair, the sound of my name sending shivers down my spine. My feet were already moving before I realized it. I took a few steps into the hallway.

I glanced back at the waiting area, now a few steps behind me. The other visitors, still scattered about, seemed completely unaware, oblivious to the voice echoing down the hall.

""Adam‚Ä¶"" Chris‚Äôs voice was more desperate now, laced with pain.

I took another step down the hallway, my footsteps echoing against the floor. As I walked deeper into the corridor, the fluorescent lights overhead buzzed louder, some of them flickering out completely, leaving long stretches of darkness. The ER rooms lined the sides of the hallway, their doors slightly ajar.

I hesitated as I reached one of the open doorways. I peered inside and immediately wished I hadn‚Äôt. There, standing in the center of the dimly lit room, was a man in a patient‚Äôs gown, facing me. The man's head moved in quick, jerking motions, shaking from side to side so rapidly that I couldn‚Äôt make out any details. It was just a blur, a sickening blur. Then, without warning, the door slammed shut with a deafening bang, and I stumbled back in shock.

My breathing grew shallow as I tried to make sense of what I‚Äôd just seen. But there was no time to process it. Chris‚Äôs voice came again, further down the hallway, ""Adam, please‚Ä¶""

I pushed forward, forcing myself to continue. The unsettling darkness around me seemed to press in from all sides. I came across another room, the door half-open. Inside, I could see a doctor standing over a patient, his back hunched as he examined something on the table. The doctor wore a white lab coat and surgical mask, his features obscured. But there was something off about the way he moved, his motions were robotic. Then I noticed the tool in his hand, a bone saw. He raised it slowly, the harsh metal glinting under the dim light, and then I heard a gut-wrenching scream from the patient on the table.

I stumbled backward, slamming into the wall behind me, my eyes wide with terror. When I looked back into the room, it was empty. There was no doctor, no patient. Just a dark, vacant space.

My hands trembled as I rubbed my face, trying to snap out of whatever hallucination I was trapped in. ""This can‚Äôt be real,"" I whispered to myself, but the corridor seemed to stretch endlessly ahead of me, and Chris‚Äôs voice continued to call out, drawing me further in.

As I turned the next corner, I froze. There, hanging in the doorway of a nearby room, was a mass of dark hair, long and tangled, spilling down from just beyond the doorframe. It looked like someone was standing behind the door, peeking around the corner. A single eye, black as pitch, stared directly at me from the darkness.

I felt a wave of nausea wash over me. The figure remained there, still and silent, just watching me. I took a slow step forward, and then the eye pulled back into the shadows, disappearing from view. The hallway was deathly quiet, save for the low hum of the lights. I forced myself to move past the doorway, my pulse hammering in my ears.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the figure again, just around the corner of the room, her head unnaturally high, as if she were crouched against the ceiling. I could see more of her this time; her elongated arm stretched out, the bony hand reaching towards me. Before I could react, the hand brushed my shoulder, cold and corpse-stiff... its fingers scratched into my skin like claws.

I bolted, my shoes squeaking on the linoleum as I raced down the hallway. I had no idea where I was going; I just wanted to get away from whatever that thing was. I threw open the first door I saw and stumbled back into the waiting room.

My heart pounded in my chest as I staggered to a stop. Everything appeared normal again, the reception desk, the plastic chairs, the other visitors who hadn‚Äôt moved an inch. It was as if none of it had happened. But my skin prickled with the lingering touch of that hand. Glancing at my shoulder, I noticed 3 faded scratch marks, a reminder that something was very, very wrong.

I slumped back into a chair, catching my breath, trying to make sense of the nightmare I had just experienced. I reached into my pocket and pulled out the crumpled list of rules, my hands trembling as I unfolded it. I glanced at Rule 4 again, the words seeming to taunt me: If you hear your friend‚Äôs voice calling from down the hallway, do not leave the waiting room to look for them.

I had ignored it, and now I was starting to believe that those rules weren‚Äôt a joke after all.

I tried to calm myself, my breathing coming in short, ragged gasps as I leaned back in the chair. I ran my hands through my hair, trying to force myself to think rationally. Maybe I was just sleep-deprived, or maybe the stress of seeing Chris collapse was catching up to me. I told myself that I had only imagined the things I saw in the hallway. But no matter how hard I tried to convince myself, the feeling of that cold hand brushing against my skin lingered.

I glanced at the clock, 1:45 AM. The minutes seemed to crawl by. I couldn't shake the dread that had settled in my chest. My thoughts drifted back to the list of rules. Each one seemed ridiculous on its own, but after my experience in the hallway, I found myself paying closer attention to each word.

That was when I noticed him, a man who hadn‚Äôt been in the room before. He stood near the entrance, his hands stuffed into the pockets of his long coat, his eyes scanning the waiting room like he was searching for someone. His presence sent a jolt of unease through me. I was sure he hadn‚Äôt been there earlier; I would have remembered his tall, lanky figure and the unsettling way his gaze seemed to linger on the other visitors, one by one.

The list. I pulled it from my pocket and read the third rule again: If a visitor arrives asking for directions, do not help them.

The man‚Äôs gaze found me, and he started walking toward where I sat. My body stiffened, every muscle tensing involuntarily. There was no mistaking his intention. He stopped a few feet away, leaning slightly forward, as though inspecting me.

""Excuse me,"" he said in a voice that was calm, but too deliberate. ""Could you help me find the ICU? I seem to be‚Ä¶ a little lost.""

The tone of his voice was polite enough, but there was something off about it, something that put me on edge. It was as though he was trying to mimic normal speech but wasn‚Äôt quite getting it right. I glanced around the waiting room, but no one else seemed to notice the man‚Äôs presence. The receptionist didn‚Äôt even look up.

I shook my head, gripping the list tighter in my hand. ""I‚Äôm sorry. I can‚Äôt help you,"" I stammered.

The man didn‚Äôt move. He just kept staring at me, his eyes narrowing slightly. ""Are you sure?"" he asked, his voice growing softer, almost coaxing. ""It won‚Äôt take but a moment. It‚Äôs just down the hall‚Ä¶ right?""

I didn‚Äôt know what to say. A part of me felt guilty for not helping him. But the words on the list kept flashing in my mind: Do not help them.

I forced myself to look away, hoping he would take the hint and leave. But instead, he took a step closer.

""It‚Äôs not very kind to ignore someone who needs help,"" he said, his tone now edged with something darker. I glanced at his face, and for a split second, his features seemed to shift. His mouth stretched into a wide, unnatural grin, the kind that didn‚Äôt belong on a human face. The corners of his lips seemed to extend too far, the teeth behind them slightly jagged.

I shot up from my chair, stumbling backward. The man‚Äôs smile didn‚Äôt waver as he turned his head slightly, like he was examining me from a different angle. Then, he turned towards the reception desk and started walking, slowly and unnatural. At one point, his head snapped towards me, unnaturally, the same grin on his face, as he continued walking. I froze, I couldn't look away. Then, as he reached the reception desk, he just passed thru it and then he suddenly disappeared.

My gaze darted around the waiting room. The other visitors were still exactly where they had been moments ago, their expressions unchanged, their movements as mechanical as before.

I glanced back at the receptionist. She was still at her desk, her face illuminated by the pale glow of the computer screen.

My gaze flickered up to the clock on the wall, it was 1:58 AM, and Rule 1 flashed in my mind: Avoid making eye contact with the receptionist between 2:00 AM and 2:30 AM.

After a few minutes, I glanced toward her, my eyes drifting out of habit. It was just for a second. The receptionist was staring straight at me, her eyes locked onto mine with an intensity that made my heart skip a beat. She wasn‚Äôt moving. It was as if she‚Äôd been waiting for this moment.

I tore my gaze away, my pulse quickening. As I turned my head, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed her get up from her chair, her movements oddly stiff, as though her joints didn‚Äôt bend the right way. She walked forward, but not around the reception desk, she passed through it, like it wasn‚Äôt even there. I froze, not daring to look directly at her again.

I squeezed my eyes shut. I felt the air grow colder, the chill pressing against my skin. It felt as if she were getting closer. I could hear the faintest rustle of fabric, the light creak of footsteps on the floor, growing louder with each passing second.

Don‚Äôt look‚Ä¶ just don‚Äôt look, I told myself, my hands gripping the edges of the chair. I sat there, tense and unmoving, my eyes squeezed shut as if I could will her away by sheer force of will.

Then, everything went still. The room fell into an unnatural quiet, the buzz of the fluorescent lights the only sound left to ground me in reality. I opened my eyes slowly, half-expecting to see her standing inches away from me, her face contorted into something inhuman. But the receptionist was back at her desk, looking down at the monitor, her posture as unbothered as if she hadn‚Äôt moved at all. The other people in the waiting room seemed unchanged, as though nothing unusual had happened.

I glanced at the clock. 2:40 AM.

A wave of relief washed over me, my shoulders sagging as the tension finally started to leave my body. I forced myself to my feet, my legs still shaky beneath me. I couldn‚Äôt just sit there, feeling like a trapped animal. I needed to move, to clear my head.

As I got up to walk around the room, I remembered Rule 2: Never walk past the reception desk without greeting the receptionist after 2:30 AM. I wasn‚Äôt about to take any more chances. I turned toward the receptionist and gave her a nod, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Uh‚Ä¶ hi,"" I mumbled awkwardly.

She didn‚Äôt look up, didn‚Äôt react at all, just continued to type away on the keyboard. I took that as a good sign and began walking a slow circle around the waiting room, forcing myself to stay calm, to pretend that everything was normal.

The chill in the air hadn‚Äôt entirely left. As I walked, I could feel a subtle shift in the temperature, a lingering cold that seemed to follow me. The overhead lights flickered faintly, casting brief shadows along the walls, giving the impression that the room was expanding and contracting with each pulse.

As I rounded the corner, I felt the presence behind me, something that wasn‚Äôt there before. I didn‚Äôt hear footsteps, but I sensed it nonetheless, like the weight of unseen eyes pressing against my back. It was close, just out of reach. My instinct was to turn and look, to confront whatever was creeping up behind me, but I clenched my jaw and kept my gaze forward, remembering Rule 8: If you feel a sudden chill, do not look over your shoulder.

I walked faster, my pulse quickening as the chill seemed to grow stronger with every step. The lights buzzed louder, the flickering more erratic. I felt something brush against the back of my neck, cold and light, like a breath.

I didn‚Äôt stop until I reached the chairs again, sinking into one with a shuddering breath. The presence faded, though the air remained icy, and I rubbed my hands together to warm them. I glanced back toward the reception desk, half-expecting to see the receptionist watching me again, but she remained focused on her monitor, her face lit by the soft glow of the screen.

I leaned back in the chair, my heart still racing. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, that the rules on that crumpled piece of paper weren‚Äôt just random scribbles left behind to scare people. Whatever game I‚Äôd found myself in, it wasn‚Äôt a joke. And now, the only way out seemed to be playing along.

I sat there for a long moment, my body trembling, trying to calm my nerves and slow my breathing.

That‚Äôs when I heard the automatic doors slide open with a soft hiss. I looked up, expecting to see another late-night visitor or a nurse making rounds, but my heart almost stopped when I saw who stepped inside.

It was Chris.

He looked perfectly fine, normal. His face had color, his clothes were clean. There wasn‚Äôt a single sign that anything had been wrong with him. Relief rushed through me, and I felt the tension in my muscles finally ease.

Chris‚Äôs eyes found mine, and he broke into a small smile as he walked over.

""Hey, Adam,"" he said casually, his voice the same as always. ""They let me out early.""

The relief was so overwhelming that I laughed out loud. ""Chris, man, you scared the hell out of me,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Are you sure you‚Äôre okay? You looked pretty bad earlier.""

He shrugged, giving a dismissive wave of his hand as he settled into the chair next to me. ""Yeah, I‚Äôm fine now. Whatever it was, I guess it passed. They ran a few tests and said there was nothing serious."" He flashed that familiar grin, the one I‚Äôd seen a thousand times. ""Guess I‚Äôm just too stubborn to stay sick.""

As we talked, something in the back of my mind itched. There was an unsettling quality to the conversation, but I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. Chris was acting normal, too normal. He was speaking in a calm, deliberate tone, his words perfectly measured. I brushed it off, figuring it was just my nerves playing tricks on me after everything that had happened tonight.

Still, as Chris continued to talk, a strange sense of d√©j√† vu settled over me. It was as if the conversation was looping back on itself, repeating the same phrases. His voice had the same rhythm, the same inflection, almost like a recording on a loop.

Suddenly. I turned to see a nurse walking briskly down the hallway, pushing a gurney. My stomach dropped when I saw who was lying on it, Chris. He was unconscious, hooked up to a heart monitor, an oxygen mask over his face.

My gaze darted back to the seat next to me, but the chair was empty. The Chris who had been sitting beside me was gone, vanished as though he‚Äôd never been there at all. My skin prickled as a wave of cold panic spread through me.

I stared at the empty chair for a long moment, my heart pounding in my ears. Then, I saw the nurse walking by the waiting room. She glanced over at me briefly, her expression neutral.

I jumped up from my chair. ""Wait,"" I called after her. ""Is Chris okay? My friend, he was just sitting here. What‚Äôs going on?""

The nurse slowed, turning to look at me with a small, tight-lipped smile. ""Your friend is stable,"" she said. ""But he hasn‚Äôt woken up yet.""

Her words hung in the air, leaving me cold and confused. I glanced back at the empty seat, then at the nurse as she continued down the ER hallway.

My head was spinning. Had Chris really been here, or had I just imagined him?

I sank back into my chair, my body heavy with fatigue and fear. I glanced at the clock again, 3 AM. Time was moving, but not in the way it should have. I felt trapped, as though the minutes were pulling me further into the unknown.

I pulled the crumpled list of rules from my pocket and unfolded it with trembling hands, my eyes scanning the lines again, looking for answers that weren‚Äôt there. I needed to understand what was happening to me, what was happening in this place. But the rules only deepened the mystery, the words twisting in my mind like a riddle I couldn‚Äôt solve.

Time seemed to move strangely now. I couldn‚Äôt tell how long I had been sitting in that chair, how long I had been wandering the room. The clock above seemed to skip minutes or stall entirely, and my sense of reality continued to blur. I rubbed my eyes, trying to shake off the fatigue that clung to me like a shroud. I glanced at the clock again, it showed 5:55 AM. Almost there, I thought. Almost free.

That was when a security guard appeared in the doorway, his silhouette casting a long shadow across the waiting room floor. He was a broad-shouldered man with a neatly trimmed mustache and a calm, almost reassuring presence. He walked toward me with an easy stride and stopped just a few feet away.

""Sir, it's time to leave,"" he said in a deep, measured voice. ""The ER is closing for non-patient visitors.""

I blinked, my thoughts catching up slowly. ""But‚Ä¶ my friend, Chris‚Ä¶ is still‚Ä¶""

Just then, I saw Chris walking out of the ER hallway. He waved to me, a tired but genuine smile on his face. Relief flooded through me, and I started to get up, then hesitated, the words from Rule 9 echoing in my head: If a security guard tells you it‚Äôs time to leave, check the clock before listening.

I turned my gaze toward the clock above the reception desk, 6:01 AM. My shoulders sagged in relief. I was finally free of this place. I nodded and followed the security guard toward the exit, Chris walking beside me. As we stepped out into the cool morning air, I felt like I could finally breathe again.

We got into my car, and I started the engine. I felt a small smile tug at my lips. I pulled out of the hospital parking lot, the tension in my chest slowly beginning to fade.

But as I drove, a strange unease crept over me. The world outside the car windows seemed darker than it should have been. I glanced at the sky, it was still a deep, inky black, with no trace of the early morning light. It was too dark, too quiet.

I squinted, peering between the trees lining the road, and my heart skipped a beat. In the shadows, I saw faint figures standing there, their forms barely visible, distorted as if they were made of mist.

Panic surged through me. I glanced at the dashboard clock, and my stomach dropped, 4:30 AM. How was that possible? It had been well past 6:00 AM when we left the hospital. I turned to look at Chris in the passenger seat, my heart pounding in my ears.

But it wasn‚Äôt Chris.

There was a shadow there, sitting beside me. Its form was a vague silhouette, its face obscured, but I could feel it watching me, feel its eyes boring into my skin. I gasped, my grip on the steering wheel tightening as my vision blurred with fear. I slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt in the middle of the road.

Suddenly, I was back in the waiting room, seated in the same stiff plastic chair. The security guard stood in front of me, a grin spreading slowly across his face, his eyes unnaturally wide and gleaming in the harsh fluorescent light.

""Time to leave,"" he said again, his voice echoing in my head like a taunt.

I felt my mind start to unravel. Had I ever left the hospital at all? Was I trapped here, destined to relive these twisted events over and over again? I buried my face in my hands, my breathing ragged as a sense of hopelessness washed over me.

It felt like hours passed, but it could have been minutes, or even seconds. I didn‚Äôt know anymore. I was dimly aware of a nurse standing in front of me, her voice calm and soothing, pulling me back from the edge.

""Sir, your friend is stable,"" she said gently. ""He‚Äôs going to be okay, but he needs rest. He‚Äôll be transferred to a hospital room soon, and you can visit him during regular visiting hours.""

I looked up at her, my vision clearing slowly. The waiting room was just as it had been, no sign of the security guard or anything out of the ordinary. I glanced at the clock, it read 6:30 AM, and a soft glow of morning sunlight filtered through the glass doors, filling the room with a warm light. The nightmare was over.

I nodded to the nurse, murmuring my thanks, and stumbled out of the ER, the cool morning air a welcome relief. As I reached my car, I glanced back at the hospital, half-expecting to see something out of place. But it looked like any other hospital in the early light, mundane and unthreatening. I got in the car and drove home, the sun finally rising to chase away the last remnants of darkness.

Later that day, I returned to the hospital to visit Chris. He was awake, sitting up in bed and looking surprisingly well for someone who had collapsed so suddenly the night before.

""Hey,"" I said, my voice trembling slightly as I pulled a chair up to his bedside. ""How are you feeling?""

Chris chuckled weakly. ""Better than I should, I guess,"" he replied. ""But I had the weirdest dreams last night. It was like I was half-conscious the whole time.""

My heart skipped a beat. ""What kind of dreams?""

Chris frowned, his brow furrowing as he tried to recall. ""One of them was‚Ä¶ I came in the ER and saw you sitting in the waiting room. You looked pretty freaked out. And then there was another one‚Ä¶ we were leaving the hospital together, just driving away into the night.""

A cold shiver ran down my spine, but I forced a smile and nodded. ""Yeah‚Ä¶ weird,"" I said quietly, my mind racing with the memory of the night‚Äôs events.

As we sat there talking, I glanced at my shoulder, where a constant pain kept tugging at me, and saw the three scratch marks from last night.

I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that somewhere, out there in the darkness of the night I had just escaped, something was still waiting‚Ä¶ and the rules of this place would not be so easily¬†forgotten.",2,1748525870.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Had a shower, got dressed. Packed my son's lunch, put a waffle in the toaster for his breakfast. Woke him up, brought him the waffle. After much coercing, I got him dressed. Packed his bag, got him in the car to head to school. Brought him into the classroom, back to the car, back home. Made myself a super quick breakfast, tidied up after. Fed the cat. Brought the garbage and recycling out to the curb. Had no time to make myself a lunch for work so I grabbed a few pieces of watermelon from the fridge and headed out. 

Half hour drive to work. Worked 8 hours. Half hour drive home. My ex was at my house with our son (ex has no bedroom for our kiddo at the moment so he hangs with our son at my house) Ex refuses to make our son dinner after school for some reason, so I make dinner. Ex says he has to leave right away so that he can go to the bar with his girlfriend to see their friend perform (who performs there every week). I get the kiddo fed, then put in the bath, then ready for bedtime. Read him books. Lay in bed until he gets sleepy, leave the room. Do the dishes, sweep the floor, fold laundry. Put on the hockey game but feel too exhausted to pay attention.. End up turning it off before the third period and passing out before I even get to enjoy any free time.

My ex's day yesterday: Up late playing video games with his girlfriend. Doesn't work that day so he doesn't need to set an alarm. Sleeps until 2 pm. Lays in bed for a while, then gets up and has a leisurely coffee and breakfast. I imagine he sat around on his phone or video game for a while, then went to pick up our son around 4:30. Brings him to my house, plays with him for an hour. I show up, he leaves to go to the bar. Has a nice evening out with his girlfriend and friends; probably with a few beers and some wings and stayed out late.

I don't know. It's not like I care that he has a nice day off. But that's not just one day, that's every day for the both of us. I know it's different for me because I have a whole house I'm taking care of alone, whereas my ex is crashing at his girlfriend's mom's house and there are 3 other people living there taking care of things. And there's no bedroom for our son, so of course it makes sense that I do more parenting. But like.. damn. I can't wait until we have a better split of custody and I'll actually get to maybe SLEEP IN for an extra hour on the weekend. Or maybe even go out for a fucking WALK on a nice summer evening instead of being chained to my house every night. 

I know lots of you have the same imbalance, even living with your kiddos other parent. Some days I'm proud of how I'm crushing it all on my own.. other days, I'm crying exhausted, burnt-out tears while I start another load of laundry.",5,1748525698.0,breakingmom,1,1.0,False
1kyaxdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1kyaxdy/my_avoidant_narcissistic_ex_23_m_may_have_kissed/,"My avoidant, narcissistic ex (23 M) may have kissed someone behind my back and I (24 F) can‚Äôt let it go","Me (24) at the time and my now ex (23) at the time, we were classmates, best friends for over a year before we started dating. We were together for less than a year. Before that, we had a talking stage for about a month, and honestly? Everything felt perfect. But deep down, even in that first month, something didn‚Äôt sit right. It felt too good to be true ‚Äî like I was just waiting for the other shoe to drop. And eventually, it did.

He changed. Fast. We started fighting a lot. He became cold, distant ‚Äî a version of him I didn‚Äôt recognize at all. That wasn‚Äôt the guy I fell for. But the truth is, I hadn‚Äôt fallen for anyone the way I had fallen for him, so I stayed. I kept telling myself it was just a phase, that it would pass. But now I look back and wish I had trusted my intuition. I could feel it in my gut that something was off from the start.

The more time passed, the more obvious it became. He had a textbook avoidant attachment style ‚Äî constantly pulling away the second things got real or emotional. He had serious issues with his father, and it reflected in the way he treated me: always needing control, always playing victim, constantly gaslighting me. Honestly, I think he was a narcissist. Everything was always about him. His needs, his feelings, his image ‚Äî I was just a mirror.

He started making excuses to not see me, canceled plans, preferred hanging out with his friends. Then came the flirting ‚Äî with other girls. And what hurt the most wasn‚Äôt even that he was flirting with them‚Ä¶ it was that he stopped flirting with me. I brought it up. He said it wasn‚Äôt intentional, made me feel like I was overreacting ‚Äî and then turned on just enough charm to keep me from walking away. Tiny moments of affection, just enough to give me hope. Breadcrumbing, love bombing ‚Äî whatever you want to call it, it was manipulative as hell.

Then came the breaking point.

One day, I told him I just needed some time to myself ‚Äî a single day like a solo date, and it wasn‚Äôt that I was ignoring him, I kept on texting him, asking if he ate as he was at his practice. And instead of respecting that, he punished me for it. He dropped off one of the girls from his band ‚Äî one he‚Äôd been low-key flirting with. I didn‚Äôt question it at first. I trusted him. I was still being loyal to a version of him that no longer existed.

Days before that, I had given him a tiny hickey ‚Äî his first ‚Äî and I kept jokingly asking if anyone had noticed. So when he told me he dropped her home, I casually asked, ‚ÄúThen you left, right?‚Äù And that‚Äôs when it all came out.

He said she told him her parents were home and needed help carrying her instruments. But when they got to her house, it was empty. She said, ‚ÄúOops, sorry‚Äù ‚Äî and invited him in for coffee. And he said yes. I asked why he couldn‚Äôt just get coffee from Starbucks or a roadside stall, and he had nothing to say. Just silence. Then he said he was too tired to drive and would‚Äôve fallen asleep otherwise. I told him that wasn‚Äôt a good enough explanation.

And then ‚Äî like it was nothing ‚Äî he added, in full detail, that while he was there, she noticed the hickey and said, ‚ÄúShould‚Äôve been a bigger one‚Äù with a wink. I wasn‚Äôt even there, but I could see it from the way he described it. I called him out ‚Äî told him she was clearly flirting. And he hit me with: ‚ÄúNothing happened. We didn‚Äôt kiss or anything.‚Äù

That was it. That was the moment everything fell apart in my head. Because I hadn‚Äôt even thought about kissing until he mentioned it. So why would he say that, unless it was on his mind? Unless he did something he wasn‚Äôt saying? That sentence ‚Äî ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt kiss or anything‚Äù ‚Äî stuck with me. Still does.

It‚Äôs been over a year since we broke up, and I still wonder‚Ä¶ Did he kiss her?

TL;DR: My avoidant, narcissistic ex (23M) changed completely during our relationship. He flirted with other girls, breadcrumbed me, and one day accepted coffee at another girl‚Äôs house to get back at me. He swears nothing happened, but randomly said, ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt kiss or anything,‚Äù and that sentence has haunted me ever since. It‚Äôs been over a year, and I (24F) still can‚Äôt stop wondering if he cheated that night.",2,1748525639.0,RelationshipIndia,4,0.75,False

My family is transitioning from a love seat/coffee table setup in our living room for computers. It was really janky but we did it for 10 years. I used a dictionary taped with  mousepad over the cup holder on my side.

I‚Äôm hoping to get advice on chairs/tables that have worked for another people. There is a ton on the market and a lot that is branded for gaming. 

1 - comfortable/ergonomic (we primarily game, no tv/cable, so it‚Äôs also a place to hang out)
 
2 - moveable (I am in the Army, and I do keep most boxes)

3 - allows for multiple PC setups in a room (my wife, daughter, and I all game together a lot)

Cost really isn‚Äôt too huge of an issue, we save a lot and buy quality > quantity.

Thank you all,
A fellow lurker

Chapter 17: We Talk About Feelings in a Death Cave**

Hazel‚Äôs ribs ached from the fall, and her left arm was numb, but hey‚Äîno broken bones, no avalanche, and no Ares. She counted that as a win.

‚ÄúReyna?‚Äù she called.

‚ÄúOver here,‚Äù came the reply. A few feet away, Reyna was half-buried in snow-dusted rubble, already trying to push herself up with Roman grit and zero chill.

Hazel helped Reyna to her feet, wincing at the sting in her shoulder. The fall had been brutal, but they were alive‚Äîand separated. Again.

‚ÄúStill breathing?‚Äù Hazel asked.

‚ÄúBarely,‚Äù Reyna muttered, brushing dust from her armor. ‚ÄúWe should move. This cave system feels‚Ä¶ wrong.‚Äù

Hazel summoned a soft, ghostly glow from the shadows at her fingertips. The darkness around them peeled back just enough to see the tunnel walls‚Äînarrow, damp, breathing with cold. Their footsteps echoed.

They walked for several minutes in silence, the kind Reyna wore like armor. Hazel didn‚Äôt mind. Silence was familiar.

But then Reyna asked, too casually:  
‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ Frank. Things good between you two?‚Äù

Hazel blinked. ‚ÄúUh‚Äîyeah. I mean‚Ä¶ we haven‚Äôt talked much lately, but last I heard, he was doing okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust‚Äôve been hard,‚Äù Reyna said, tone even. ‚ÄúDating during everything. Camp. War. Prophecies.‚Äù

Hazel gave a dry laugh. ‚ÄúYeah, nothing says romance like near-death experiences.‚Äù

Reyna cracked half a smile.

They kept walking. The tunnel narrowed slightly, forcing them to move single file for a bit. When it opened back up, Reyna spoke again.

‚ÄúDid it help? Having someone‚Ä¶ with you. That kind of connection.‚Äù

Hazel glanced at her. ‚ÄúYeah. It did. Even with all the madness, having Frank gave me something real. Something steady.‚Äù

Reyna was quiet for a few steps. Then:

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never really had that,‚Äù she said, almost under her breath. ‚ÄúSomeone who saw me‚Ä¶ not as a leader. Or a soldier. Just‚Ä¶ me.‚Äù

Hazel studied her face, the set of her jaw. The walls were up, but there were cracks. Tiny ones.

‚ÄúYou deserve that, you know,‚Äù Hazel said gently. ‚ÄúTo be seen. To be chosen.‚Äù

Reyna‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt shift, but her voice went clipped. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Hunter of Artemis.‚Äù

Hazel raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôve sworn off all of that.‚Äù

Hazel smirked. ‚ÄúYou said that like a reminder to yourself.‚Äù

Reyna‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a weakness.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never said it was.‚Äù

More silence. Then Hazel added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just saying‚Ä¶ even Artemis wouldn‚Äôt want you to lock yourself away from *everything.* We‚Äôre still people, Reyna. Not just oaths and armor.‚Äù

Reyna was quiet again. Then, attempting to be nonchalant‚Äîfailing miserably‚Äîshe said,  
‚ÄúSanju. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶ strange.‚Äù

Hazel tried not to smile. ‚ÄúIs that a bad thing?‚Äù

Reyna gave a thoughtful shrug. ‚ÄúNo. Just‚Ä¶ unpredictable. He acts like nothing fazes him, but I‚Äôve seen the way he watches the ground like he‚Äôs trying not to break it.‚Äù

Hazel smiled softly, keeping her gaze forward. ‚ÄúHe listens when people talk. Really listens. That‚Äôs rare.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve noticed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed *you‚Äôve* noticed.‚Äù

Reyna‚Äôs head snapped toward her. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt noticed anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù Hazel said, grinning now. ‚ÄúOf course not.‚Äù

Reyna rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúEven if I had‚Äîwhich I haven‚Äôt‚Äîit wouldn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm a Hunter.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs not the kind of guy who pushes,‚Äù Hazel said quietly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs patient. If something ever *did* matter‚Ä¶ he‚Äôd wait.‚Äù

They walked on. The air in the cave felt a little warmer. Not much‚Äîbut enough.

Behind them, the darkness stayed silent.

But Hazel smiled, just a little.

She understood.

Chapter 18: We‚Äôre Not Who We Were

The first thing Percy noticed was the cold seeping into his bones. The second was the pain pounding behind his eyes like a war drum.

He groaned and sat up slowly, every muscle protesting. Stone crunched beneath him. His sword, Riptide, lay a few feet away, half-buried in snow-dusted gravel.

Then he remembered.

‚ÄúAres,‚Äù Percy muttered. ‚ÄúThat flaming jerk.‚Äù

The god‚Äôs war stomp had cracked the mountain open like a jawbreaker. One second they were winning‚Äîmaybe‚Äîand the next they were falling. 

His head throbbed like it had gone twelve rounds with a war god‚Äîwhich, technically, it had. He groaned and pushed himself up on one elbow. Rock walls curved around him, dimly lit by bioluminescent moss and dripping water. A tunnel, or maybe a tomb. Hard to tell.

He coughed. ‚ÄúRachel?‚Äù

No answer.

He tried again, louder. ‚Äú Leo? Hazel? Sanju? Reyna?!‚Äù

His voice echoed back at him, empty and fading.

‚ÄúSanju!, Leo, Hazel, Rachel.Anybody ‚Ä¶. please‚Äù he shouted, panic sparking.

He scrambled to his feet‚Äîwobbled‚Äîand scanned the dim cavern. Cold air hung heavy, thick with dust and the distant echo of dripping water. No light from above. No voices. No way back.

Then he saw a flash of red hair, half-buried under rock.

His heart dropped.

‚ÄúRachel!‚Äù

He rushed to her side, knees hitting the stone hard. She was unconscious, twisted awkwardly, with dust streaked across her face and a gash along her brow. Her leg‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt right.

‚ÄúNo, no, no‚Ä¶‚Äù

He started moving rubble, gently as he could, muttering under his breath, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay. You‚Äôre gonna be okay. Don‚Äôt you dare die on me, Dare.‚Äù

Once she was mostly clear, he grabbed his shirt and tore a long strip from it‚ÄîCamp Half-Blood logo and all‚Äîthen carefully tied her leg. It wasn‚Äôt the best splint in the world, Annabeth would have given C+, but it was something.

Rachel stirred with a groan. ‚ÄúDid I just get stepped on by a planet?‚Äù

Percy let out a laugh‚Äîshaky but real. ‚ÄúNope. Just war personified.‚Äù

Her eyes fluttered open. ‚ÄúOh. That‚Äôs better.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou scared me.‚Äù

She blinked, then winced as she tried to move. ‚ÄúFeels like I broke something.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did. Your leg‚Äôs pretty banged up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she muttered, ‚Äúguess I‚Äôm not kicking any monsters today.‚Äù

Percy chuckled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do the kicking. You just focus on not dying.‚Äù

Rachel scanned the cave. ‚ÄúWhere are the others?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. We got separated when Ares cracked the ground. Everyone fell. I tried calling out‚Äînothing.‚Äù

She leaned back against the wall and exhaled slowly. ‚ÄúFigures. We were doing so well.‚Äù

Rachel nodded weakly. ‚ÄúFeels like we‚Äôve fallen into the Earth‚Äôs spleen.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and it hates us.‚Äù

He sat beside her. They sat in silence for a beat.

Then Rachel said, ‚ÄúYou know, this is weirdly familiar. You and me. Injured. Underground.‚Äù

Percy smirked. ‚ÄúWe really know how to pick date spots.‚Äù

Rachel snorted. ‚ÄúPercy, I dumped you.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill counts.‚Äù

She laughed, then winced again. ‚ÄúOkay, laughing hurts. Not allowed.‚Äù

Percy glanced at her. Rachel continued ‚ÄúYou really never looked back?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot once.‚Äù

He looked down. ‚ÄúI thought you would. For a while.‚Äù said Percy.

‚ÄúI almost did,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúBut being the Oracle‚Ä¶ it changes things. It‚Äôs not something you can do halfway.‚Äù

‚ÄúI get it. Eventually.‚Äù said Percy.

Rachel turned to him. ‚ÄúI knew you and Annabeth were always the endgame. Even when you didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

Percy felt a slow smile tug at his lips. ‚ÄúTook me long enough to figure that out.‚Äù

Rachel nodded. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good for you. Keeps you humble.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe calls me ‚Äòseaweed brain‚Äô at least twice a day.‚Äù said Percy 

‚ÄúSee? True love.‚Äù Rachel replied 

Percy looked at her. ‚ÄúYou okay with how it ended? Us, I mean.‚Äù

Rachel nodded. ‚ÄúWe were never supposed to be forever, Percy. We were‚Ä¶ a moment.‚Äù

He let out a breath. ‚ÄúA weird, paint-splattered, apocalypse-adjacent moment.‚Äù

She smiled. ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù

Another rumble echoed through the tunnels.

Rachel flinched. ‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôre not leaving me here.‚Äù

Percy stood up and offered his hand. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not getting rid of me that easily.‚Äù

‚ÄúI weigh a lot more than I look, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve fought a hundred-foot-tall Titan with a sword the size of a bus. I think I can handle one injured mortal.‚Äù

She raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou're sure you're not doing this out of guilt?‚Äù

‚ÄúRachel, I‚Äôve faced down gods, titans, monsters, and high school. I‚Äôm helping you because I care. Guilt‚Äôs not part of it.‚Äù

She took his hand, wincing as she stood on one foot. ‚ÄúOkay, Hero Boy. Let‚Äôs find our team before something else collapses.‚Äù

He grinned. ‚ÄúLead the way‚Äîslowly.‚Äù

She smirked. ‚ÄúAnd when we get out, you owe me coffee. And fries.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want fries after this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI *always* want fries.‚Äù

As they limped deeper into the cave system‚ÄîPercy half-carrying her, Rachel muttering directions even though she had no idea where they were‚Äîthey both knew the truth:

They weren‚Äôt who they used to be.  
And that was okay.


 Chapter 19: Crushes and Caves**

Leo woke up with a face full of moss and something heavy on his chest.

For a split second, he thought it might be a boulder, or worse, a particularly enthusiastic cave troll. But then he groaned, blinked past the fuzziness in his vision, and realized it was just Sanju‚Äîresident son of Gaea, currently doing his best impersonation of a weighted blanket.

Leo grunted. ‚ÄúSanju, bro. You‚Äôre killing me here. If you wanted a hug, all you had to do was ask. No need to crush my lungs in the process.‚Äù

Sanju stirred with a muffled groan, his head resting on Leo‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWhat happened‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWe fell. Tunnel. Separated from the others. Probably cursed. The usual.‚Äù

Sanju pushed himself upright with a wince and blinked around. The dim cave was lit only by faint green luminescence dripping down the walls like nature‚Äôs attempt at a glow stick party.

‚ÄúEveryone else?‚Äù Sanju asked, looking around.

Leo shook his head. ‚ÄúMIA. Hopefully not squashed under a rock somewhere. Come on, we‚Äôd better start looking‚Äîor at least figure out if this place has cell service.‚Äù

They picked themselves up and started moving, the cave stretching on in narrow paths and sloping curves. The silence was thick, broken only by the crunch of loose stone under their boots and the occasional distant drip of water.

For a few minutes, neither of them spoke.

Then Sanju, in that quiet, half-curious tone of his, said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve‚Ä¶ been in a relationship, right?‚Äù

Leo nearly tripped over a rock.

‚ÄúWow, okay. Jumping straight into the deep end. Yeah. Kinda. A few false starts, but there‚Äôs been one real one.‚Äù

Sanju glanced over, not quite making eye contact. ‚ÄúCalypso?‚Äù

Leo nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Trapped-on-a-magic-island Calypso. Long story short: I crash-landed there, she tried to kill me with gardening tools, we ended up falling for each other. Romantic, huh?‚Äù

Sanju gave a small, amused smile. ‚ÄúSounds like it.‚Äù

Leo kicked a pebble down the path. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs amazing. Sharp as anything, powerful. Way too good for me, honestly, but hey, even a grease monkey gets lucky sometimes.‚Äù

Sanju was quiet for a moment, then said, ‚ÄúMust be nice. Having someone who gets it. Who sees you.‚Äù

Leo tilted his head. ‚ÄúIt is. Though seeing me usually involves watching me set things on fire or make bad puns.‚Äù

That got a chuckle out of Sanju.

‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôve just been wondering,‚Äù Sanju continued, ‚Äúif people like us ever really get to have that. You know, something... real. Something lasting.‚Äù

Leo glanced at him. Sanju wasn‚Äôt looking at him‚Äîjust watching the shifting shadows on the walls.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a heavy question for a morning stroll through the depths of a cursed mountain.‚Äù

Sanju gave a one-shouldered shrug. ‚ÄúJust thinking. There are people on the team who seem so composed. Like‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt have time for that kind of stuff. Doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt feel it, though.‚Äù

Leo raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúTalking about anyone specific?‚Äù

Sanju gave a tiny smile. ‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù

Leo waited.

Sanju exhaled. ‚ÄúOkay, maybe someone. Just‚Ä¶ people like Reyna. She‚Äôs got everything under control. Strong, smart, always leading. It‚Äôs hard to imagine her letting someone in.‚Äù

Leo smirked, but kept it low-key. ‚ÄúAh. So that‚Äôs where this is going.‚Äù

Sanju looked genuinely flustered. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it like‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúRelax, man,‚Äù Leo said with a grin. ‚ÄúI get it. Reyna‚Äôs... well, Reyna. There‚Äôs a reason half the Roman legion probably wrote sonnets about her. She‚Äôs intense. But also good. Loyal.‚Äù

He paused, then added, ‚ÄúYou know she‚Äôs a Hunter now, right? Of Artemis.‚Äù

Sanju blinked. ‚ÄúYeah. I heard. That mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe's sworn off dating,‚Äù Leo said, scratching the back of his head. ‚ÄúBut that doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs not still a demi-god. Doesn‚Äôt mean she doesn‚Äôt feel stuff. Hunters may choose the immortal warrior path, but they‚Äôre not robots.‚Äù

Sanju nodded slowly. ‚ÄúSo... even if she made that choice, it doesn‚Äôt erase who she is underneath it.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Leo said. ‚ÄúIf anything, it just means she values her heart enough not to waste it.‚Äù

Sanju nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. She just... doesn‚Äôt show much. Makes you wonder if anyone ever sees her. Really sees her.‚Äù

There was a beat of silence.

Leo tapped his fingers against his tool belt. ‚ÄúYou do.‚Äù

Sanju looked at him, startled. ‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶?  me‚Ä¶.?‚Äù

Leo didn‚Äôt push it. Just gave a knowing shrug. ‚ÄúJust saying. You see her. Might be worth something.‚Äù

Sanju didn‚Äôt say anything, but the look on his face said *everything*. It was the expression of someone who hadn‚Äôt expected to be caught, but also wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a bad thing.

Then the floor lit up.

Green light pulsed beneath their feet, flowing like water through thin cracks in the stone. The patterns glowed in delicate arcs, spreading down the tunnel and branching like roots.

Leo took a quick step back. ‚ÄúUh, that‚Äôs new.‚Äù

Sanju crouched, examining the glow. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not natural.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs ancient earth magic.‚Äù

Sanju looked up at him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ancient earth magic.‚Äù

Leo with panik ‚ÄúOkay, nope! I‚Äôve seen this movie‚Äîthis is the part where the floor eats us and we end up as glow-in-the-dark fertilizer!‚Äù
 
 Chapter 20: Earth Beneath, Sky Above**

It began with a glow‚Äîsoft and green, like moss touched by morning sun.

The ground pulsed beneath them‚Äîslow, steady, and glowing a soft, ethereal green.
First under Leo and Sanju‚Äôs feet. Then in another tunnel with Hazel and Reyna. And finally, beneath Percy and Rachel, the light spread like veins through the stone‚Äîancient and alive.

Leo took a startled step back. ‚ÄúOkay, either the cave‚Äôs turning into a glow stick or we‚Äôve been cursed. Again.‚Äù

Sanju didn‚Äôt answer. He sank to his knees, hands pressing into the warm, glowing stone. His breath hitched. The world around him fell quiet.

And then he felt it.

**Her.**

Not the chaotic force that once rose as Gaea, bent on vengeance, on swallowing gods and burning Olympus to ash. Not the voice that screamed in cracks and earthquakes.

This was different.

Softer.

Older.

His breath caught in his throat.
He could feel it‚Äîher.
Not in words. Not even in thoughts. Just a warmth. A pull.
His mother. Prithvi. The Earth. Once feared as Gaea, now something older, gentler. Still powerful. Still vast. But no longer furious.
Sanju closed his eyes. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs showing us the way out.‚Äù
Leo raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat, like‚Ä¶ earth-GPS? Are we getting turn-by-turn directions from Mother earth herself?‚Äù

Sanju didn‚Äôt respond. He leaned in, pressing his forehead to the rock.
Then he spoke‚Äînot aloud, but through the ground itself. His voice traveled along the stone in faint vibrations, barely audible, yet unmistakably his.
‚ÄúHazel. Reyna. Percy. Rachel. Follow the light. I‚Äôve got you.‚Äù

In a separate tunnel, Reyna froze. Her hand tightened on her sword.
‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù she asked.
Hazel nodded slowly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Sanju.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe's... inside the rock?‚Äù
Hazel touched the glowing path ahead of them. ‚ÄúFeels like he‚Äôs everywhere.‚Äù

**‚ÄúMaa‚Ä¶‚Äù** The word slipped out like a breath he‚Äôd been holding his whole life.

There was no voice. No words.

But he felt her.

Not like a god. Not like an enemy. Like something deeper.

Like **home**.

Images flickered in his mind‚Äîmemories not his own, carried in the roots of the world. Mountains rising. Rivers carving valleys. A world being shaped not by fury, but by love. Not destruction, but care.

**Gaea** had been rage incarnate.

**Prithvi** was life itself.

He felt her sadness first‚Äîancient grief pressed deep into stone. Regret tangled in roots. He saw the wars. The broken oaths. The children who turned away.

And then‚Ä¶ he felt her love.

Not loud. Not demanding.

But endless.

A warmth in the marrow of his bones. A mother‚Äôs quiet presence in every leaf and pebble. She wasn‚Äôt here to command or conquer.

She was here because her child needed her.

Sanju let the tears fall freely now. ‚ÄúYou came for me.‚Äù

A ripple passed beneath his hands. The light brightened in response.

He spoke again‚Äîthrough the stone this time, his words carried like a heartbeat through the mountain‚Äôs veins.

**‚ÄúHazel. Reyna. Percy. Rachel. Follow the path. She‚Äôs leading us home.‚Äù**

Across the caves, the others felt it.

Not just Sanju‚Äôs voice‚Äîbut *something older*.

Reyna, sword still in hand, paused. ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt just Sanju, who's doing this.‚Äù

Hazel nodded. ‚ÄúThat was Mother  Earth herself.‚Äù

Rachel glanced at Percy as they stepped onto the glowing trail. ‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs safe?‚Äù

Percy hesitated. Then nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Sanju. And‚Ä¶ whoever she is now. She doesn‚Äôt feel angry.‚Äù

They followed.

The mountain opened before them.

They emerged from different tunnels, one by one, blinking into golden sunlight and fresh air. 
Hazel saw Percy and Rachel first and sprinted over. Reyna followed, calmer, but with relief in her eyes. Leo and Sanju brought up the rear.
They were scratched, bruised, and exhausted‚Äîbut they were together
The glow beneath their feet slowly faded as they reached the edge of the rocky cliffs.

For a moment, none of them spoke.

Then Sanju stepped forward, alone.

He knelt again, his fingers brushing the last of the light before it sank back into the stone. The world was quiet‚Äîbut not empty.

He closed his eyes. ‚ÄúThank you, Maa. For changing. For remembering love.‚Äù

The breeze stirred the grass. The earth hummed quietly beneath him‚Äî*a heartbeat, not a war drum.*

She wasn‚Äôt the same as before.

Neither was he.

Leo stepped forward, slower than usual. ‚ÄúShe really did it. Saved us all.‚Äù

Sanju didn‚Äôt rise. He stayed kneeling, one hand pressed to the earth.

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt have to. She *wanted* to. That‚Äôs the difference.‚Äù

Reyna moved beside him, her voice gentle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the reason she remembered who she used to be.‚Äù

Sanju opened his eyes. ‚ÄúMaybe. Or maybe‚Ä¶ she just needed someone to listen.‚Äù

Percy crossed his arms, studying the boy in front of him like he was seeing him for the first time. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just her son.‚Äù

Sanju stood slowly, brushing dirt from his hands.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm her *hope*.‚Äù

The six of them stood in silence, wind tugging at their clothes, the mountain resting peacefully behind them.

She had once been a goddess of rage. But today?

Today she was a mother again.

And through Sanju, she had chosen grace over wrath.

The team started walking to their destination. They had their doubts. But one thing was sure.

Sanju's mom was not the one they knew.

Gaea had been the storm, a tempest that raged against the world, seeking to tear it apart. But Prithvi... Prithvi was the earth itself silent, enduring, cradling her child in the quiet strength of the mountains and the softness of the soil. Where Gaea had sought to command with fury, Prithvi whispered with love. She was no longer the mother of destruction, but the mother of ‚Äúrenewal‚Äù her love rooted deep, woven into the very fabric of the world she now sought to protect. And in that moment, Sanju understood: she had never truly abandoned him. She had only been waiting, patient as the earth, for him to listen.

Chapter 21: A Blessing in Disguise

The team trudged forward, the weight of their journey pressing on their bodies, but their spirits remained high. Their pace was slow, each step a reminder of the battles they‚Äôd fought and the ones that still awaited them. The air was thick with the scent of pine and earth, the sound of their footsteps muted against the rugged terrain. Rachel limped beside Percy, her arm draped over his and Hazel‚Äôs shoulders for support. Her usual sharp wit was gone, replaced with quiet determination. But despite the pain, there was a fire in her eyes.

As they walked, there was a strange comfort in the silence. It gave them time to think about what they were really up against, and what they had already lost. 

Percy‚Äôs thoughts drifted to his mom, as they often did when he had a moment to himself. Sally Jackson was a mortal, yet she had fought harder than any demigod he knew. She‚Äôd faced monsters, gods, and impossible odds all to protect him. He remembered the time she‚Äôd literally fought a monster just to save him, and the way she had defied every expectation placed on her. And she did it all without any magical abilities, without the powers of a demigod or a god. She had faced monsters with nothing but a frying pan and a mother‚Äôs love.

In that moment, Percy understood something about Gaea, too. Gaea, the primordial Earth, was no different. Sure, she was a goddess, but she was a mother first. Percy knew that Gaea had watched her children‚Äîthe Titans‚Äîbe overthrown by the Olympians. Kronos, Atlas, Prometheus‚Äîeach one punished for their actions, some even banished to Tartarus. Atlas was forced to hold the sky for all eternity. Prometheus was chained to a rock, his liver eaten by a vulture for giving fire to humanity. And Zeus and his brothers, Poseidon and Hades, had divided the world between them, leaving the Titans with nothing.

Percy couldn‚Äôt blame Gaea for being angry. She had been robbed of everything. Just like any mother, she would do anything to protect her children, even if that meant going to war with the gods themselves. It was something Percy understood more than ever now. If his mother had the power of a primordial goddess, she would‚Äôve kicked Zeus‚Äôs and Ares‚Äôs butt without hesitation. And that was exactly what Gaea had done.

A mortal mother might fight monsters to save her child. A primordial goddess would tear the world apart.

Percy smiled grimly to himself, thinking about his own mother. Yeah, she‚Äôd do that. And so would Gaea.

The sound of an approaching vehicle broke Percy‚Äôs thoughts. A four-seater pickup truck appeared on the horizon, kicking up dust as it rolled toward them. It stopped about twenty meters away. 

The driver‚Äîa man dressed like a Tibetan monk, with long, dark hair instead of the usual shaved head‚Äîstepped out of the truck. His calm demeanor and the aura of power around him immediately caught Sanju‚Äôs attention.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs one of mine,‚Äù Sanju said, a slight grin tugging at his lips. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs from my camp. He‚Äôs come to pick us up.‚Äù

The man waved as he approached them, and the team began moving toward the truck. Just as they were about to reach it, a familiar presence shimmered into existence. The silver-haired goddess stood before them, radiant and still, like a moonbeam wrapped in steel. Her eyes scanned the group with a mix of curiosity and quiet disappointment.
 **Artemis** stood in their path‚Äîtall, ageless, and silver-cloaked. Her expression was unreadable‚Äî*not angry*, but *not quite pleased* either.

‚ÄúChildren,‚Äù she said, voice cool and clear. ‚ÄúYou have wandered far.‚Äù

The group froze.

Percy stepped forward, wary but respectful. ‚ÄúWe are on a quest. Sort of.‚Äù

Artemis‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúThen explain. What is it you wish to do?‚Äù

Rachel was the first to speak. ‚ÄúUranus is rising. We don‚Äôt know how soon, but it‚Äôs happening.‚Äù

Hazel added, ‚ÄúAnd the Labyrinth?. If we can fix it‚Äîcontrol it‚Äîit could unite the demigod camps.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe're re-building a path,‚Äù Percy said. . ‚ÄúFor alliance.‚Äù

Artemis said, her eyes sweeping across the group. ‚ÄúYou should all be aware, the gods know.‚Äù

The team stopped. Reyna turned slowly. ‚ÄúKnow what?‚Äù

Artemis‚Äôs gaze landed on Sanju. Her expression didn‚Äôt change, but her voice lowered‚Äîjust enough to chill the air around them.

‚ÄúThey know about him.About who he truly is.‚Äù

Sanju stiffened.

Rachel frowned. ‚ÄúYou mean that he‚Äôs Gaea‚Äôs son?‚Äù

Artemis corrected her softly. ‚Äú*Prithvi‚Äôs son, perhaps. But to the gods? Blood is blood.‚Äù

Hazel took a step forward, tension in her voice. ‚ÄúSo what does that mean? They‚Äôre angry?‚Äù

Artemis was silent for a moment. ‚ÄúNot all. But some are‚Ä¶ concerned. Suspicious. Even afraid.‚Äù

Percy crossed his arms. ‚ÄúAfraid of *Sanju*?‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you be?‚Äù Artemis asked. ‚ÄúThe child of the one who once tried to tear Olympus from its roots? Who nearly ended us all? He was born from the Earth itself‚Äîmore raw power than any demigod should carry. And now, you walk beside him into the Labyrinth. The gods watch. They see.‚Äù

Sanju swallowed hard. He didn't meet her eyes.

Leo scoffed. ‚ÄúWell, maybe they should get to know him before judging. He‚Äôs not Gaea.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Artemis said, more gently now. ‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt. But gods do not forgive easily. Nor do they forget.‚Äù

Reyna stepped in front of Sanju, her voice low but steady. ‚ÄúWe chose to walk with him. And we‚Äôll face whatever comes together.‚Äù

Artemis looked at her for a long time. Then nodded once.

‚ÄúI see that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I respect it. But understand this‚Äîyour loyalty to him may cost you more than you realize.‚Äù

Rachel‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúIs that a warning?‚Äù

‚ÄúA truth,‚Äù Artemis said simply. ‚ÄúSanju‚Äôs fate is not written in any prophecy. He stands outside the path of the stars. That terrifies the gods more than anything.‚Äù

Finally, Sanju found his voice. Quiet. Firm. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one ever does,‚Äù Artemis replied, her voice softening. ‚ÄúBut you must carry it all the same. And how you carry it‚Äîhow you protect the ones who believe in you‚Äîthat is what will shape the world.‚Äù

There was silence.

Then Percy said, ‚ÄúWell, sounds like the gods need to stop being scared and start being useful.‚Äù

Artemis gave a ghost of a smile. ‚ÄúSome would agree with you.‚Äù

She said once more. ‚ÄúWalk carefully. Olympus is watching. And the sky‚Ä¶ is stirring.‚Äù

Artemis was silent for a moment. Then she looked at Reyna.

‚ÄúYou,‚Äù she said, more gently. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve done enough. Come with me now. Return to the Hunters. Your place is waiting.‚Äù

The air shifted.

Reyna stood still, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword. Her eyes darted to Sanju, just for a second.

But it was enough.

Sanju met her gaze. He didn‚Äôt say anything‚Äîdidn‚Äôt beg or plead. But there was something in his eyes. A kind of silent question. *Please don‚Äôt go.*  
And something else‚Äî*I need you.*

Reyna‚Äôs heart skipped. She didn‚Äôt break the stare.

She turned to Artemis. ‚ÄúWith all due respect, my lady... I choose to stay.‚Äù

Artemis‚Äôs silver brows lifted ever so slightly. ‚ÄúIf you stay, you will no longer be a Hunter of Artemis.‚Äù

Reyna nodded, glancing at Sanju once more. ‚ÄúI know. And I accept that.‚Äù

There was a beat of silence. Then Artemis gave a short nod. ‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù

She turned to the rest of the group. ‚ÄúI will speak with Sanju alone.‚Äù


The others filed into the pickup truck. Leo claimed shotgun like it was his birthright. Hazel, Percy, and Rachel crammed into the backseat. Reyna climbed into the cargo bed, her armor clinking gently as she sat down.

Sanju remained behind.

He approached Artemis quietly, trying not to fidget under her sharp gaze.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre different,‚Äù Artemis said softly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not like them.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Sanju said, unsure if it was a compliment or a warning.

Artemis‚Äôs silver gaze fixed on the horizon as Sanju approached, the air around him shimmering with a power even the gods paused to respect. ""You are more than a demigod, Sanju,"" she said quietly, her voice echoing like a sacred hymn through the stillness. ""There is a fire in you that rivals the might of Olympus, a strength that whispers of Titans and forgotten gods. You are not one of them‚Äîyet‚Äîbut the distance between what you are and what they were grows smaller with each step you take.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean it,‚Äù Artemis continued. ‚ÄúThe Titans hate you. The gods fear you. Most demigods would gladly see you exiled. Mortals don‚Äôt even know you exist. You walk alone in this world, Sanju‚Äîexcept for a few friends and the family who raised you.‚Äù

Sanju‚Äôs throat tightened.

‚ÄúProtect them,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúThey are your tether. Guard them with your life.‚Äù

She turned, beginning to walk away.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Sanju called out. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm not a demigod... or a god‚Ä¶ or a titan‚Ä¶ then what *am* I?‚Äù

Artemis stopped. Turned.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre something new,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSomething good.‚Äù

And then, after a pause, she looked back over her shoulder, the barest smile on her lips.

‚ÄúAphrodite once prophesied Reyna wouldn't find love in a demigod,‚Äù she said, like it was nothing. ‚ÄúFunny, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean‚Äî?‚Äù

But Artemis had already vanished.


Sanju stood still for a moment, heart pounding. A breeze stirred the trees. For the first time, he felt okay being different. Maybe even proud.

He climbed into the cargo bed beside Reyna. She was sitting with her back to the cab, arms folded. When he settled next to her, she looked sideways at him.

‚ÄúWhat did Artemis say?‚Äù

Sanju hesitated for only a second. ‚ÄúShe said I‚Äôm more than a demigod. Close to a god or titan. But not yet.‚Äù

Reyna looked at him. Not just a glance. She *looked*.

And he looked back.

Something passed between them‚Äîquiet, steady, undeniable.

No words were exchanged.

None were needed.

Sanju leaned back against the truck railing, the wind beginning to whip past them as the engine started. Reyna sat beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. And for the first time in a long time, he didn‚Äôt feel alone.

Whatever was coming next‚Äîsky gods, collapsing labyrinths, or ancient prophecies‚Äîthey would face it together.

And that?

That was enough.

Last week, Jen ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù spilled her giant iced coffee all over my desk.

But here‚Äôs where it gets spicy: Jen just hit me up asking if I can help her move some heavy furniture this weekend, ‚Äújust a few boxes‚Äù she said. Keep in mind, this is *right after* she wrecked my setup and didn‚Äôt offer to help with the cost of repairs or anything.

Now, I‚Äôm all about being a good roommate and helping out, but I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm being totally unreasonable by thinking: **‚ÄúNope, I‚Äôm done playing the helper guy until she covers my gaming losses.‚Äù**

1kyarul,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netherlands/comments/1kyarul/introverts_in_the_netherlands_how_do_you/,"Introverts in the Netherlands, how do you experience the culture?","Hello fellow introverts, extroverts, and anyone in between,

I have a question specifically for introverts: how are you doing in the Netherlands? Do you perceive Dutch culture as more introverted or more extroverted?

I've been living here for a while, but I still can't decide. On one hand, I find the culture very individualistic. People value independence, and everyone kind of does their own thing. On the other hand, coming from a culture where people speak quietly and softly, never approach strangers in public spaces (not even at bars), and avoid unnecessary small talk at all costs, I actually experience Dutch society as quite extroverted.

Let me share a specific example from work. I'm a manager, so my job involves a lot of communication: building relationships, solving people-related issues, and being generally social. I can do it well in a professional setting, but after work, I desperately need alone time to recharge. My ideal weekend? Reading a book, taking a quiet walk, or spending time with family - sometimes even separately.

What feels especially strange to me are lunch breaks. At my company, it‚Äôs very normal to eat together as a group. But for me, the perfect lunch is escaping to a nearby park, eating alone in silence, and then grabbing a coffee before going back to meetings. The few times I‚Äôve done this, I noticed subtle reactions - people looking at me like I'm being antisocial or awkward. Where I'm from, it's completely normal to take solo time and nobody bats an eye. There‚Äôs this silent pressure to be social, and it weighs on me. Even among friends, if I say I need time alone over the weekend, I feel misunderstood at times, almost like I‚Äôm breaking some kind of unspoken rule: how dare you want to be by yourself, are you crazy? It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt enjoy seeing people, I really do enjoy spending quality time together. But I simply don‚Äôt need it as much, especially after a long workweek of constant interaction.

So fellow introverts:

\- how do you experience Dutch culture?

\- do you feel similar pressure to be more extroverted than you naturally are?

\- are these just social norms we‚Äôre expected to follow, even when they don‚Äôt align with who we are?

And for any extroverts reading this: do you actually find Dutch habits extroverted, too? Or do you feel there‚Äôs a social ceiling here as well?

Curious to hear how others navigate this, whatever end of the spectrum you're on. Have a great day :)",0,1748525236.0,Netherlands,8,0.4,False

1kyaqua,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kyaqua,I'm done collecting until I can get my hands on odyssey artisto. Top row = buying for life. Bottom row = not rebuying. Forgot to add qahwa(buy for life) and LB (not rebuying). Review and names in description so mods please dont nuke this,"The placement in each row is random but my top 5 would be nitro white, supremacy collectors edition, lattafa kingdom, odyssey aqua, and qahwa. The scents alone make them top 5 but I feel like they'd cover all bases in terms of weather and occasion.



I'll do a quick review for every fragrance here. Most of the top row fragrances have either great longevity and sillage.



Hunter intense is very fresh citrus with great longevity and sillage.



Lattafa Ramz hasn't even matured yet but the vanilla, mint and lavender are great together, lasts forever too.



One million is just an easy compliment getter. Smells playful and sexy. People say its too popular and over used but I think thats mostly men saying it. Women don't care and still love it.



Dylan blue is the perfect amber citrus scent imo. Its also cheap at discounters and lasts a while.



Supremacy Collectors edition is such an amazing scent. The pineapple feels eternal and the woody and moss notes are very pleasant. You could wear this year long in any occasion.



I havent had nitro white for long but its instantly a favorite. The juniper makes it very playful and the vanilla + honey makes it very playful and mass appealing.  Its also very versatile and long lasting.



Aqua odyssey is very linear but its such a good scent that I don't care. The citrus + mint + lavender + patchouli combo is so fresh and long lasting. Its my go to for summer and the gym.



Kenzo pour homme marine is such a unique scent if you haven't smelled any of the kenzo pour homme line. The notes are simple but strong. Its like you just finished swimming at the beach and you're sitting on a log with a bed of flowers around it. Longevity and sillage are beast mode too.



Lattafa the kingdom really earned that name. To me its king of all vanilla scents. Its so pleasant and mass appealing. Easy compliment getter and women LOVE it. You can even pull this off in the summer if you're going to be indoors. 



Khamrah Qahwa is a very good gourmand fragrance. The cinnamon, praline, and vanilla are very balanced and to me the coffee note is very light. It also lasts forever too.



Now for the bottom row of fragrances that I wont buy again. Other than lucky, none of these are bad fragrances, they either just don't last long enough or don't wow me.



One million lucky had a lot of hype but to me it just smells like some 90s perfumes my mom would wear.




Mandarin sky smells good but I just don't see an occasion where I'd want it over something from the top row. Maybe it needs more time to mature.




CDN intense man is definitely intense and long lasting but the opening isnt great and for a summer freshie I'll be reaching for odyssey aqua over this.



December vanilla is a very nice boozy vanilla sweet scent but it just leans a bit too feminine for me. That said I did receive a good amount of compliments wearing it. I was told I smelled like honeycomb toffee. But I'll always be reaching for the kingdom over this.



Tag rosso is a great invictus victory elixir clone. Its warm spicy, aromatic and vanilla. Feels mature. But again this and kingdom fit the same weather and occasions, so I'll be taking the kingdom 



Le parfait parfum was originally one of my favorites. It still smells amazing. The fruit and ambergris are powerful just not long lasting enough.



Nitro red smells so good. The watermelon jolly rancher vibe is so pleasant but I just feel like nitro white takes the red vibe and brings it to another level for me. But if you prefer fresh over creamy take red.




Jorge di profumo would be in the top row if it lasted longer. This stuff is gone in a few hours for me. Its a very mature scent, citrussy with spicy and tobacco. 




The tiny ahh versace eros smells good, love the mint but it just doesnt last long enough.



Versace pour homme smells good and definitely pulls compliments but in my experience the people complimenting it are already quite close to you, embracing etc. So the sillage and longevity arent that great. 



Finally liquid brun isn't bad at all, its actually quite good. Its aromatic and the praline and vanilla notes are nice. But it doesn't outshine kingdom or qahwa so I'll be rebuying those 2 over this.



I'm happy to answer any questions.

Only connection to the world is the internet for when I need to interact with anyone, and the car when I need stuff. Stopped hanging out at coffee shops back in the previous century. These days, ""going out"" is rarely any fun anymore anyway. The people waiting on you are obviously underpaid, overworked, and miserable. The owners have to gouge gouge gouge on everything so eating out or even getting a coffee is stupidly expensive. Sure, there's the library. But the local religious loonies are doing everything in their power to shut that place down because, well, books, and not enough people in my town have the bandwidth left in their lives to put up much of a fight. So, who knows how long that place will be around.

Then, there's my basement. The teenage boys live down there. The driveway wraps around back so their friends can pull up and walk in the back door without having to encounter the upstairs grownups. Our house is ""in-town"" whereas all the other teens my boys know come from families that bought out in the hinterlands of the town, way down isolated roads where their parents tried to create bunkers of their own. 

There is a large sitting area, a crash pad if you will. They have arranged two other sitting areas outside, one under the deck when the weather is bad and another around the small fire pit in the back for when the weather is good. Every other night there is the deep base emanating up through the floorboards from the sound track of some movie or game they have running on the screen down there. Every other morning there are two sleeping forms I don't really recognize sprawled on the couches (everybody disappears out the back door by eight in the morning). 

I get it, I guess. Or maybe I probably don't. But I'm pretty sure that ""home"" for most of these guys is pretty dreary. Around here, home means Reactionary Mom and Reactionary Dad and eight siblings and boredom. But, catch a ride into town and there's...the basement basement of my house. It's free. There's no cover charge. Always something going on. The whole rest of the town is within walking distance and there is no closing time and no fees. I have a strict no-drugs and no-drunk-driving rule for my boys and for anyone that comes over here, but other than that they are left alone. 

There's no doubt in my mind that being young these days is atrocious. I have no idea what these kids are going through. Sure, I spend every night worrying that they will all figure out eventually how to get into some serious trouble together, but in that respect the situation is no different than anything or anywhere else to I guess I am just glad they have created a third place for themselves.

I've always been under the impression that the maillard phase needs to be dialed in and that it can be overdone. 

I've recently read that if you extend the maillard phase out, the sweeter the coffee will become. Excellent! I love sweet coffee.

But, what struck me a bit funny is I thought overdevelopment happened in this phase. Like if you sit in maillard too long, you get ""overdeveloped"" tastes like bitter, stringent, etc. Keep in mind, i'm not talking about if the roast stalls and sits at a specific temp for several minutes. Im talking constant decrease in RoR like a good roast should but sitting in maillard phase for a looooonnnggg time.

Should the rule of thumb be the longer in maillard phase the better without, of course, baking the roast?",3,1748524895.0,roasting,3,1.0,False

I woke up tired yesterday and felt depressed and felt very bad about my decision to relocate. Then come afternoon that everything felt very doomed: I was super depressed, everything felt very negative, I would get nauseous watching YouTube, I was obsessing about my relationship with the kindest girl I have ever met, etc. So the spiral of negative thoughts became stronger and stronger. Meanwhile, I had a terible dihearria throughout the day.

At 8 pm, I decided to rest, went to bed, I felt  shivering, and had muscle cramps all over the body. Then looking back at the day, I found out that I had about 7-8 cups of coffee and probably very dehydrated. I tried to hydrate but it wasn't helping a lot. Finally, I popped a lorazepam (my last resort) and at around 2am, I finally got to sleep.

So, I have many questions: has anyone else experience similar symptoms with high caffeine intake (especially OCD flare up and psychosis)? I am asking this to know if this is something beyond caffeine or it is that. Also, how should I quit coffee at this point? Because given the depressive episode that I am experiencing, I am worried that quitting coffee would make it worse. 

Any advice is much appreciated. ",1,1748524878.0,decaf,1,0.67,False

Not sure how many times I‚Äôll rewrite this, but here it goes. I‚Äôm hoping to meet people around my age or older‚Ä¶those who appreciate conversations that aren‚Äôt rushed or forced, but grow naturally over time, like slow-burning stories.

*English isn‚Äôt my first language*, so I might stumble or ask you to repeat things now and then. Still, I find that talking with native speakers is the best way to learn, like catching tiny moments textbooks never mention, or those unspoken meanings hiding between the lines.

I‚Äôm drawn to books that make me think, long walks into quiet places where the world slows down, and yoga to find balance when life gets too loud. I don‚Äôt open up quickly, but I do notice the small details  the ones most people miss, like the way a pause can say more than words ever will.

1kyajil,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kyajil/can_the_delta_children_jeep_adventureglyde/,Can the Delta Children Jeep AdventureGlyde Stroller Deliver the Best Ride? A Review,"The Delta Children 11466-2184 Jeep AdventureGlyde Stroller is one of those everyday products that, at first glance, seems like your standard lightweight travel companion for parents, but taking it for a ""test drive"" revealed much more. As a parent juggling daily outings, errands, and the unpredictable chaos of pint-sized energy bursts, this stroller became my ally. That said, while I overall enjoyed my experience, a few quirks stood out during extended use.

**Overall Design and Ease of Handling**  
Its sleek black-and-grey design is understated yet functional. I particularly appreciated the stroller's lightweight alloy steel frame, clocking in at just 15 pounds. For something you tug, push, and collapse countless times daily, that weight (or lack thereof) makes a significant difference. Maneuverability stood out too. With precision technology incorporated into the swivel front wheels, navigating tight store aisles or zig-zagging through winding park paths felt exceptionally smooth. The back-wheel brakes added extra control, which was especially handy when on hilly terrain.

[Find the best price for Delta Children 11466-2184 on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0c5426d81/)

**Compact Folding for On-the-Go Parents**  
Let me tell you, the compact umbrella fold stood out as a lifesaver. The dimensions, once folded‚Äî9.5‚Äù x 6.7‚Äù x 41.7‚Äù‚Äîfit perfectly in my car's compact hatchback and even slid neatly into the smaller luggage compartment of my parents‚Äô RV. Add the locking latch and carry handle, and you could practically tote it like a briefcase. As someone who travels regularly, knowing this stroller fits theme park size requirements was a cherry on the cake. No awkward measures or gate-side frustrations needed with this one.

**Child Comfort Features**  
With three reclining positions for the seat, my toddler alternated between nap mode and sightseeing mode effortlessly. The oversized canopy with its UPF 50+ extendable sun visor shielded her from glaring sun and pesky drizzle alike‚Äînature can‚Äôt keep us indoors for long! That said, as nice as the seat is, the 100% polyester mesh fabric felt more suited to milder weather. Hot days left my little one looking slightly flustered, especially during longer outings.

**Safety First**  
The JPMA certification and five-point safety harness provided peace of mind; knowing my child was secure whether we were strolling through uneven neighborhood sidewalks or cluttered department store aisles. Reflective shoulder pads were a thoughtful touch too, ensuring visibility for evening strolls.

**Ample Storage Space**  
The extra-large storage basket is a dream addition for any parent. On grocery runs, it held everything from a gallon of milk to spare diapers and still had room for my gym bag. The integrated cup holder‚Äînot overly flashy but highly practical‚Äîkept my coffee upright, even during unexpected squirrel-inspired stroller detours.

**Advantages**  
- Lightweight design makes it incredibly portable.  
- Smooth handling with precision wheel technology‚Äîturning feels effortless.  
- Spacious storage basket accommodates a variety of items.  
- Compact fold is superb for travel or limited storage spaces.

**Pitfalls**  
- Mesh seat material isn‚Äôt ideal for hot summer days.  
- The five-point harness, though secure, felt slightly stiff‚Äîfor a squirmy toddler, strapping in took patience.  
- Single cup holder doesn‚Äôt allow for additional drink options or items.

**Competing Products**  
Several rivals exist in the lightweight travel stroller category, such as the Summer 3Dlite Convenience Stroller and Baby Jogger City Tour 2. While the Summer 3Dlite boasts a similar lightweight frame, it lacks the advanced precision wheel maneuvering seen in the Jeep AdventureGlyde. On the other hand, the Baby Jogger City Tour 2 impresses with its superior fabric and luxury build but misses an easy-to-access storage basket of this scale. Delta‚Äôs model strikes a balance‚Äîgreat functionality without veering too far into the luxury price bracket.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Considering what you get‚Äîdurable steel construction, storage galore, child-comfort features, and dependable safety mechanisms‚Äîthe value is undeniable. Some pricier competitors don‚Äôt offer the same blend of practicality and efficiency at this price point. Sure, there are trade-offs, but for someone on a budget or not keen on splurging for a secondary travel stroller, this product won‚Äôt disappoint.

1kyaj4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Logo_Critique/comments/1kyaj4b/turned_a_plain_2d_logo_into_a_photoreal_3d_render/,"Turned a plain 2-D logo into a photoreal 3-D render in under a minute with one ChatGPT prompt, this is how","I fell down a rabbit hole called **‚Äú3D Effect with ChatGPT‚Äù**. The PDF claimed I could turn any boring, flat logo into something that looks like a Cinema 4D render, no design skills needed. It‚Äôs basically a dead-simple workflow **for marketers, content creators, or anyone doing visual branding.**

I was skeptical, but curiosity won. Here‚Äôs the exact ride:

# What I did (takes ~2 min)

* **Found a texture** \- Googled ‚Äúmatcap PNG,‚Äù grabbed a shiny copper sphere with transparency.
* **Dug up my logo** \- plain black-and-white SVG exported as a 2000 px PNG.
* Dropped both images into ChatGPT and **pasted this prompt**:

‚Äã

    Apply the texture from the first image to the logo in the second image. Make it look 3-D, rendered in Cinema 4D, 8 K.
    Keep the logo‚Äôs shape/orientation, background black, and crank the light‚Äìshadow contrast.

# What blew my mind

* **Speed:** From ‚Äúhmm, maybe‚Äù to finished art in under a minute. Perfect when a client pings ‚ÄúCan we make it pop?‚Äù at 5 p.m.
* **No learning curve:** I‚Äôve fought with Cinema 4D before‚Äîthis was drag-and-drop simple.
* **Infinite looks:** Swap ‚Äúcopper‚Äù for ‚Äúholographic glass‚Äù or ‚Äúbrushed steel‚Äù in the prompt; instant new vibe.
* **Reusable:** Saved the prompt as a snippet. Now I can churn out variants on demand for A/B tests or seasonal campaigns.

# Reality check (what I‚Äôd tweak next)

* **Fine-tuning:** If you need pixel-perfect lighting, you‚Äôll still polish in Photoshop or a 3-D app.
* **Texture = brand voice:** Chrome shouted ‚Äútech startup.‚Äù Wood felt ‚Äúcraft coffee.‚Äù Choose wisely.
* **Experiment:** A slight prompt nudge (‚Äúsoft studio light‚Äù vs. ‚Äúharsh rim light‚Äù) changes everything. Fun rabbit hole, but set a timer!

# Why it‚Äôs worth your time

* Instant production value for decks, thumbnails, TikTok intros, without a designer‚Äôs bill.
* Rapid concepting if you‚Äôre pitching re-brands or running social A/B tests.
* Zero cost: the guide is free, ChatGPT is already in your toolbox.

My face can be stoic and people can tell im off like they can read my mind

I also have a HUUGE probl√®m with how people react to my hair im a black ginger ans the attention i get from it is so annoying.

I literally have to say hi to people to snap them out of their trance. This attention makes me angry asf. Too much attention not enough money. 

Like i really wanted to be normal like everyone else why did i have reincarnate in this body???

But i know i have issues i also talk to myself lmao and people see this at work i also notice i get angry at work n i dont want it  to be  that way. 

I did some research and found that there are actually m√©dications that blunt emotions.

I know what my probl√®m its its all the stimulants im taking. I notice when smoke cigarettes coffee and weed im tense and mean also the prana in my body goes away.

If i cut these things out for even a day i become a completely different person. 

Basically i become my real self and have high emotions like i literally will cry for somone i they lose their phone or if their sad. Also i be happy for no reason with too much energy. I can be by myself tell myself jokes and laugh at them. I am a very strange individual 

If you ever watched one pi√®ce and seen how luffy the protagonist acts in gear 5 thats exactly how i am sober. 

But honestly i hate that version of myself vibrating so high im a freakin maniac this is why i smoke. To turn that off.

I kind of want to be numb to things kind of like the redditor cyber fury minus the big im enlightened ego with the dickheadedness 

Another thing i noticed lately thats new about me is that i like being humbled. Like i get a kick out of it or something. 

Any advice? Also need a psychiatrist as well. 

Side note i know im tripping about my hair people actually love my hair and i get alot of love. I know the beliefs i have are not true. But its apart of me that wants to be some sort of victim thats wants this story im telling myself about myself to be true this is soo crazy

Usually comes on about 5-15 minutes after the first sips of the fresh brew. It also doesn't taste like a coffee shop's cold brew, it seems more bitter.

But every cup after that, for the rest of the week, tastes fine and doesn‚Äôt cause any issues. I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this or has ideas on what might be going on?

Here‚Äôs my setup and process:

* **Beans:** 111-115g of coarsely ground beans (ground up \~3 seconds in my Nutribullet)
* **Water:** \~58 oz cold or room temp water in a 64 oz mason jar (to leave space for the grounds/filter)
* **Brew gear:** Stainless steel mesh filter inside the jar (County Line Kitchen brand)
* **Timing:** Let sit at room temp for \~2 hours, then move to fridge
* **Total brew time:** 16-18 hours (down from 24h, to see if I was over-brewing it)
* **Filtering:** After brewing, I remove the mesh filter, then pour the batch through a paper filter to catch sediment
* **Dilution:** First cup is usually about 6 oz coffee + ice + splash of water

Even with the extra water/ice, the **first cup always tastes stronger and slightly bitter** than later ones. I‚Äôve tried swirling the jar before pouring, but I still get that weird head sensation and a strong aversion to finishing the cup.

Any thoughts? Is it just too much caffeine or something else? (highly caffeinated brews at coffee shops don't give me this effect) Could it be over-extracted compounds? Or just too concentrated early on? Is my ratio off? Would love any advice or shared experiences.

1kyaea8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1kyaea8/stolen_cup/,Stolen Cup,"Today is an office day for me, which is completely over stimulating as it is. Well it appears that people don't care of something they've picked up to use is not theirs, and ot could belong to someone else.

I have a cup that I use every office day. Today is day 1 of 2 in a row this month, so already a very difficult day. It's super noisy, over crowded, but even with that I am the only person from my team in the office. 

Well Today because of replying to emails, my 15 minute break was shortened to 10 minutes (yes, I know, no ones fault but mine, as I chose to respond to an email). I left my cup empty, with the lid off, and unclean by the sink in the office, and when I went to use my cup for a coffee less that 2 hours later, it was gone.

Me having my mug stolen means, no coffee for the rest of the day, as I do not feel comfortable using an office mug, and the travel mugs are washed in the building, and usually have lipstick remnants on them. It's a mug I use all the time, and have done for years, I cannot use a different mug.

I have bought iced coffees in bottles, as its the closest thing I can get to a coffee, but it's not the same. I don't understand why someone would take what doesn't belong to them.

The cup I had, I can never get the same design, and it always made me smile. It was a purchase when things were bad in my life, and was an attempt to cheer myself up. I have had it for 7 almost 8 years now, and it was a discontinued design in TK Maxx. And, although it was a ceramic mug, it had a takeaway top to it, so my mess was contained for once.

I don't know now, what I am supposed to do for future office days, or how to retrain my brain into using a different mug. This is a routine disruption as well as a source of comfort being taken from me. Thankfully I have a Lexxic coaching session today for my Autism and ADHD, so perhaps they'll have something to coach me on how to retrain and retrain fast, as I'm in the office tomorrow too ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†

I work in commissioned sales for a very large UK company. We work either solo or in small teams of 2-3 in public.

Yesterday I worked with a man who among many other extremely inappropriate things told me about how he cheats on his wife, fantasizes about killing her, and fantasizes about killing other people.  At one point he was discussing fighting someone and brought his fist centimeters from my face.

I pride myself on being very unflappable, but this has me reeling. I kept my shit together in the moment and told him he should seek therapy, or medical advice. He replied that he can't, because if he did, they'd have to report him as a risk to himself/others. I even went out and got him a coffee.

We don't have any on-site mgmt, and I'm concerned about going to our manager because it is rumoured that she is beholden to him for outside work reasons... Also I have general doubts surrounding my managers competence.

Also I realize that this is a ""my word against his"" scenario if I should raise it. I would be concerned not enough would be done, and that these violent fantasies of his would shift to me if he were to know I pressed the issue. If he got fired over it, he would very easily know where and when to find me.

For some cultural context, my team is predominantly the same religion, including my manager and this coworker. I am irreligious. In seeing this coworker's interaction with others of his religion, he very much filters himself and behaves normally. I believe he only shared this information with me because I am not of his religion, and he somehow felt like he could share it. I say this as an extra emphasis on the fact that if I make a situation out of this, he will likely strongly deny it, and certainly know that this complaint came from me.

Based on current scheduling I would only cross paths with him 2-3 shifts a month, but I'm dreading it. I was thinking about just letting it go and gritting my teeth, but then my wife asked ""how are you going to feel if he kills someone""

This became far longer than I anticipated. Thanks for reading. At any rate it's been therapeutic to type it out.

His new business (a climbing gym) just happened to open right when our baby girl was born. He works 78 hours per week (12-10pm weekdays and 10-10 weekends, no days off) and while baby was super little it made sense that he would be entirely focused on the business and I would be entirely focused on the baby. I'm breastfeeding, a SAHM, and didn't mind solo parenting a newborn. 

Now baby is almost 7 months old and he's not doing anything to help with her, or really any consistent chores around the house except the lawn. I do all night time wakings (he sleeps in a separate room), and even when we're both up in the morning I do all the diaper changes, solid food feedings, playing with her, etc. His routine is to wake up around 8, drink his coffee on the couch while playing on his phone, then take about an hour in the bathroom to poop and shower, then head into work early.

I'd really love his help, and I've asked very gently a few times but nothing seems to stick. Am I expecting too much from him? I know he's under a ton of stress with the new gym (it's not doing fantastic) so I don't want him to resent his home life too. But I'm starting to get burned out from taking care of baby 24/7.

1kyabaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kyabaz/explore_waterdrop_wdf46_refrigerator_water_filter/,Explore Waterdrop WD-F46 Refrigerator Water Filter Review Is It Worth the Upgrade,"The **Waterdrop WD-F46 Refrigerator Water Filter**, designed as a replacement for LG ThinQ refrigerators, has been a game-changer in my daily routine. Living in an area where tap water often tastes like it‚Äôs gone through a rusty pipe, I‚Äôve tried several water filters in the past few years. Some were decent, others completely useless, but this one? This filter is solidly impressive‚Äîthough not without its quirks. Here's my take after testing it for a couple of weeks.

**Design & Build Quality**  
This water filter has an understated but efficient design, boasting dimensions of 5.71""D x 3.54""W x 7.09""H. What immediately impressed me was its compatibility with a wide range of LG refrigerator models like LFXS28596S, LMXS28626D, and even some Kenmore units. The material is a coconut shell-activated carbon, which isn‚Äôt just effective but eco-friendly‚Äîa win-win for me. Everything from the grooves to the tightly fitted construction screams precision. I didn't even need tools to install it, just screwed it in confidently, and boom‚Äîit fit like a glove.

[Check Waterdrop WD-F46 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b07h9lhmr2/)

**Installation Process & User Experience**  
I always dread installing new filters because it can get messy (think water spilling or seals not aligning). This one, however, was refreshingly easygoing. The instructions were clear, and the entire process took under five minutes‚Äîa massive relief for the not-so-tech-savvy folks in my household. I didn‚Äôt encounter a single leak! They even include month-install stickers, which help you keep track of when the filter is due for replacement‚Äîthough let‚Äôs be honest, I likely won‚Äôt check it until the water starts tasting funny again.

**Key Benefits**  
- Stellar performance in filtering out chlorine, bad taste, and odors.  
- Maintains essential minerals while removing impurities.  
- Backed by NSF 42 and NSF 372 certifications for filtration quality and safety.  
- Perfect fit for multiple refrigerator models, ensuring no leaks.  

**Performance & Filtration Quality**  
The real test came when I filled a glass and took a first sip. Gone was the faint metallic tang I'd gotten used to ignoring. This replacement filter elevates water quality, leaving it crisp, neutral, and surprisingly refreshing. Its Sri Lankan coconut shell carbon block filtration really cuts through chlorine and suspended particles while keeping the beneficial minerals intact. I even tried using the filtered water for coffee, and believe me, the difference in taste was noticeable‚Äîno more weird off-notes. Plus, the purification capacity of 200 gallons (or roughly six months) means I won‚Äôt need to think about changing this anytime soon.

**Drawbacks**  
Let‚Äôs talk about the ‚Äúless than shiny.‚Äù A small gripe was the packaging; nothing was damaged, but it felt slightly underwhelming considering the product's high functionality. It also might seem pricey for someone who usually buys cheaper filters, but trust me, the performance justifies the upfront cost.  

- Packaging could feel more premium for its price tier.  
- Not universally compatible beyond specific refrigerator brands.  

**Good Points**  
- Includes handy refrigerator stickers for tracking replacement times.  
- Made from BPA-free, food-grade materials.  
- Affordable given its performance, though mid-range buyers might hesitate.  

**Competitive Options**  
In the crowded world of refrigerator water filters, the Waterdrop faces stiff competition from brands like EveryDrop and Samsung OEM filters. While EveryDrop might win in terms of its broader compatibility, its price tag can be daunting. Samsung, on the other hand, matches Waterdrop in filtration efficiency but often lacks in affordability and availability. The Waterdrop excels by offering eco-conscious manufacturing and a great-performing product that doesn‚Äôt demand selling your soul.  

**Price Performance**  
While not the cheapest option on the market, I‚Äôd argue that this filter is worth every penny. Its ability to drastically improve the taste and safety of my drinking water while being simple to install makes it a practical choice for anyone who values quality over bottom-dollar savings. You also won‚Äôt find many products that hit the sweet spot between affordability, compatibility, and efficacy quite like this one.

Okay, that might be an exaggeration, but you get my point. The clock‚Äôs ticking, and we gotta get our act together! Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing to prep for this AI takeover, and trust me, it‚Äôs making a HUGE difference. üôå 

### **1. Learning the Tools of the Trade**  
   - **Online courses:** I‚Äôm diving into platforms like Coursera and Udemy to not just learn about AI, but how to effectively use AI-driven tools for content creation. 
   - **Podcasts & webinars:** Filmy Fridays -> AI chat! Listen to the latest trends while ironing those shirts you haven‚Äôt worn in weeks. üéß
   - **Explore tools like ChatGPT and Jasper:** Yep, they‚Äôre not just for dumb jokes! Learning to collaborate with AI is a GAME changer.

### **2. Networking with the Experts**  
   - Finding others who care about this stuff is so key! Check out LinkedIn or Reddit threads and just pop in with ‚ÄúHey, I'm learning about AI workflows‚Äîany advice?‚Äù Let the magic happen! ‚ú®  
   - *Bonus:* You could even join us in *AiContentAutomators* where we‚Äôre all about sharing tips and tricks to thrive in this new world! üåç

### **3. Embracing Change**  
   - Mindset matters! Instead of freaking out about job losses, I‚Äôm thinking of how AI can boost *my* productivity. Why work harder when you can work smarter? It‚Äôs time to flip the script! üìñ  
   - Regularly ask myself, ‚ÄúHow can I make *this* process easier with AI?‚Äù What could be the next project I automate? ü§î

### **4. Taking Action**  
   - Practice actively! I‚Äôve been experimenting by using AI tools to create social media posts and pretend blog entries. You gotta get those hands dirty to see what works! ü§ñ‚úçÔ∏è  
   - Join educational programs! I recently came across this promising online resource [Imagine Education AI](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals). It has some cool courses that help refine your understanding of AI and content creation. Fancy a little investment in your future?

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going to be an easy ride. The ride might even have a few unexpected twists that could make the best rollercoaster look like a kiddie ride! üé¢ But think of it this way: every moment we spend hustling to adapt is an investment in our future. Let‚Äôs future-proof ourselves, my friends!

So, what's your game plan? Are you diving into AI or taking a leisurely stroll? I‚Äôm super curious to hear about everyone‚Äôs journey through this craziness. üåà",1,1748523868.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

When I decided to embark on a 30-day journey with LbTonic, I was looking for a natural solution to enhance my energy and focus. Like many people, I faced daily challenges of fatigue and a lack of concentration that impacted my productivity. My goal was to see if LbTonic could genuinely provide the boost I needed to tackle my busy schedule more effectively.

From the first few days of taking LbTonic, I noticed a gradual shift in my energy levels. Initially, there was a subtle increase in my ability to stay awake and alert throughout the day. Unlike traditional energy supplements that often lead to crashes, this formula seemed to promote sustained energy without jitters. My daily routines became more manageable as I no longer felt the need for multiple cups of coffee to stay focused.

As weeks progressed, the most remarkable change was in my mental clarity. Before LbTonic, I struggled with moments of distraction, particularly during work hours. Now, I found myself laser-focused, accomplishing tasks more efficiently. This heightened concentration not only improved my work quality but also positively affected my personal life, as I was more present during conversations and activities with friends and family.

Incorporating LbTonic into my daily routine was straightforward. I took it consistently each morning, and my overall experience was enhanced by feeling more motivated to engage in activities I once found draining. Physical exercise, which often felt like a chore, became invigorating, further boosting my mood and overall well-being.

The 30 days with LbTonic have transformed not only my energy levels but also my mindset. If you‚Äôre seeking a natural way to elevate your focus and vitality, LbTonic may be worth considering. My experience suggests that with consistency and patience, one can unlock new levels of productivity and engagement in daily life.

**Me:** For over a year‚Äî irrespective of market conditions and FUD‚Äî**the Kendu community kept showing up.**

* Products launches (Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu games, Merch,etc)
* Real-life events (Kendu Nights, Kendu pickle ball events, Murals, Music festivals)
* Social media content- Be it crypto, Reddit, Instagram, Stockwits etc

**You: Is this just a meme wrapped in a nice story?**  
**Me:** Not even close. Kendu want to become **the largest decentralized marketing force** and show to the world what happens when decentralized community works together for a common goal! Every holder is a contributor. Every product is built from community pulse. **And here‚Äôs the best part: it‚Äôs all real.** No paid hype. No flash-in-the-pan influencers. Just belief, conviction, and a long-term vision.

**You: So‚Ä¶ what is the endgame?**  
**Me:** The endgame is very simple- **Building Long Lasting Legacy.**

*Remember, Kendu isn‚Äôt here for the next pump‚Äîit‚Äôs here to* ***redefine what memecoins can be.***

*It‚Äôs not about ‚Äúwen Lambo,‚Äù it‚Äôs about ‚Äúhow can we build more together?‚Äù*

**And finally‚Ä¶ Welcome to Kendu.**

**If you're just discovering Kendu, you're early.**  
**If you've been here, you already know.**  
**And if you think memecoins can't build anything real‚ÄîKendu will prove you wrong.**

**Kendu is creating the blueprint for future communities!**

A friend showed me this tool they built for themselves at work. We were catching up over coffee and they casually mentioned they‚Äôd stopped manually drafting sales proposals, contracts, and technical documents.

Naturally, I asked, ‚Äú*Wait, what do you mean you stopped writing them?*‚Äù

They pulled up a screen and showed me what looked like a search bar sitting inside a document editor.

They typed:

 ‚Äú*Generate a proposal for X company, similar to the one we did for Y ‚Äî include updated scope and pricing*.‚Äù

And then just like that‚Ä¶ a clean, well-formatted document appeared, complete with all the necessary details pulled from previous projects and templates.¬†

They had spent years doing this the old way. Manually editing contracts, digging through old docs, rewriting the same thing in slightly different formats every week.

Now?

* You can ask questions inside documents, like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs missing here?‚Äù¬†
* Search across old RFPs, contracts, and templates ‚Äî even PDFs
* Auto-fill forms using context from previous conversations
* Edit documents by prompting the AI like you‚Äôre chatting with a teammate
* Turn any AI search result into a full professional document

It‚Äôs like **Cursor for documents**. having a smart assistant that understands your documents, legalities and builds new ones based on your real work history.¬†

The best part? It‚Äôs free. You can test it out for your next proposal, agreement, or internal doc and probably cut your writing time in half. (sharing the link in the comments)¬†

While I am using it currently, if you know of any similar AI tools, let me know in the comments.¬†

""Good luck, Tyler!"" MK called out, the shot cutting to a close-up of her, Scott, and Axel getting into position. ""You're gonna need it!""

""So will you!"" Tyler replied, matching her tone and smirk as the shot moved to him, Dawn and Noah standing ready.

""On your mark!"" Chris said through his megaphone. ""Get set!"" His shot moved to the left third of the screen as the remaining portion was divided horizontally between the two groups. ""Go!"" He blew his airhorn, and the campers were off to a low challenge theme.

A close-up of the bubbling toxic goop panned up to show MK, Axel, and Scott arriving at the edge of the first moat, a bamboo pole on the ground nearby. ""Great. It's too wide to jump across,"" MK complained.

""And toxic enough to eat through pretty much anything,"" Scott added, the shot panning over as Axel picked up the bamboo pole with a curious look.

""Well start looking for something to get us across,"" MK commanded as the survivalist gave the pole a cursory bending, and smiled at its resilience.

""I have just the thing,"" Axel said, rejoining those she was helping and holding up the pole. ""We can pole vault across!""

MK and Scott shared a small smile.

Another close-up of the toxic waste gave way to a shot of Tyler, Noah, and Dawn, the former two now holding bamboo poles of their own. Noah grunted and tried to snap his, only to fail, but he smiled. ""Okay, looks like these are pretty strong. Maybe we can use them as stilts?""

""Then let's go!"" Tyler said excitedly, moving to stick his pole into the waste.

""Wait!"" Dawn shouted, grabbing both Tyler and Noah and pulling them back. ""We can't rush into this,"" she said to them. ""Do you want to be mutated?""

Tyler looked at her blankly. ""Not... really...""

""Just give these to me for now,"" Dawn continued, taking the poles from the other two, ""and we'll figure out how to do this safely.""

""Alright, but we have to be quick about it,"" Tyler said with a hint of worry in his voice.

Confessional: Noah

‚ÄúI know the team I'm helping consists of Heroes, per say, but I'm not going to turn my back on them,‚Äù Noah confessed. ‚ÄúAnd it's not like I can take the money for myself.‚Äù

Confessional Ends

A flash took the scene back to MK as she ran towards the moat with pole in hand, Scott and Axel crouched down right at the edge. With a grunt, she slammed the end of the pole down between them and vaulted over, Axel grabbing the pole the moment she let go of it so that it didn't fall into the waste. MK landed on the other side with a grunt, quickly standing up from her slight crouch.

""Got it!"" MK called out to her helpers.

""Go on ahead! We'll be there soon!"" Scott replied as the shot cut to him and Axel, the latter still holding onto the pole.

The scene flashed to what looked like a home theater in the spa hotel. The room was decorated with red and gold streamers, and a buffet table was set up against the wall. The eight non-helpers and Beardo were watching the finale as a live feed on an insanely large flatscreen television.

""Looks like Tyler's got this in the bag,"" Eva told the others.

""No,"" Caleb declared. ""MK's going to win this.""

""Wanna bet?"" Eva asked with a smirk.

""As a matter of fact,"" Caleb smirked himself, pulling out a hundred dollar bill, ""I do.""

""I'll join in as well,"" Emma chimed in with a ten.

""Okay, everyone who wants in bet something,"" Caleb told everyone, ""and whoever wins, everyone who bet for them splits the pot. Deal?"" Everyone muttered their agreement.

The camera cut to a coffee table as several hands placed bills on it.

""And MK is done with the first moat,"" Chris announced using his megaphone as the scene flashed back to the challenge, ""taking the lead! Tyler better hurry up if he wants to stay in this!""

""Duh,"" Tyler muttered in close-up before the shot zoomed out and revealed Noah clinging to his back with his legs wrapped around his waist and Dawn holding on to Noah's waist. ""Alright, are you all tight back there?""

""As tight as I can be,"" Noah answered.

""I'm good too,"" Dawn called out.

""Then let's do this thing,"" Tyler said, picking up the two poles they'd found. A close-up showed that footholds had been tied about two-thirds of the way up each one. The shot pulled back again as he charged forward and threw the two poles so that they landed upright side-by-side at about the middle of the moat. They immediately began to hiss, but Tyler was able to jump onto them then use them to leap the rest of the way to the other side, Noah and Dawn screaming all the way.

They landed with a thud in a heap in front of a ladder, and Tyler raised his arms in victory. ""Boo-yah! I am the stilt-jumping champion!"" he boasted as Noah slid off his back and Dawn picked herself up.

""Okay, let's never do that again,"" Noah said as he took a breath. ""Now let's get moving!""

The background score lightened considerably as a flash put the shot back at the Peanut Gallery, all watching the finale.

""See?"" Eva asked the others. ""Tyler's catching up.""

""Catching up is still losing,"" Heather replied.

""We should keep watching still,"" Shawn added.

""Welcome to level two!"" Chris announced as Tyler climbed up to the moat of lava, then turned around and helped Dawn and Noah up as well. ""The finalists are now tied,"" he added to Tyler, Dawn, and Noah's confusion, ""and no one's dead. Yawn."" A pan to the right showed MK, Axel, and Scott standing on the thin ledge and looking around in confusion. ""Let's go, people!"" Chris commanded.

""How are we supposed to cross?"" MK asked her helpers. ""The only tool around here is this."" She bent down, and picked up a pink pogo stick.

""Then it'll have to do,"" Scott told her. ""Just build up some momentum and hop across.""

MK gave him a dry look. ""Tell me you're joking.""

""Well what else are you going to do?"" Axel asked her. ""Especially now that you're not in the lead?""

MK glared at her, then looked uncertainly at the pogo stick and groaned.

""Okay, think,"" Tyler told himself. ""There has to be a way across.""

The shot pulled back a little to show Noah and Dawn looking around with a frown. ""There's nothing up here,"" the bookworm complained. ""No poles, no jetpacks, not even any really big rocks!""

Dawn scrunched her face up in confusion. ""...really big rocks?"" she repeated questioningly.

""Yeah,"" Noah said. ‚ÄúI could toss them into the lava and use them as stepping stones.""

""Kind of like a bridge,"" Dawn said with a thoughtful smile. ""That's a pretty good idea.""

""But all we got around here is a bunch of useless pebbles,"" Noah said with a frown as he looked around again.

Tyler‚Äôs expression became sly. ""Yeah, but that's not the only thing we can use to build a bridge,"" he told him, pointing down.

Noah's brow rose in surprise as he looked at what he was pointing at, and the camera panned down to show the ladder they had climbed.

The music cut out as the scene flashed to Chris, standing by the first moat with his phone ringing in his hand. He wordlessly answered it and was greeted by angry, unintelligible shouting. ""True,"" the host said, ""I should've known better. We just forgot which of the unlabeled canisters were air, and which were pure helium."" The person on the other end yelled some more, the camera panning a bit to the right as an unseen intern presented the host with a cup of coffee. Chris nonchalantly took a sip. ""Well,"" he told the person on the other end of the line, ""my optometrist tested that, and it turns out my hindsight is actually quite bad.""

The other person yelled so hard that Chris winced and moved the phone away from his ear. ""Oops!"" the host said, causally tossing the phone over his shoulder and into the moat as whoever he'd been talking to continued to yell. The phone sunk into the waste with a hiss of smoke.

The challenge theme resumed as the shot cut back to MK, still looking at the pogo stick she was holding. ""Slow him down,"" she said.

Scott grinned. ""We're on it.""

""What?"" Axel asked in confusion just before he grabbed her shoulder and drugged her off.

The scene immediately cut to a close-up of a ladder standing apparently freely in the air. It was then lowered over the lava moat, and the shot zoomed out to show Tyler holding the base of it with Noah and Dawn on alert behind him.

""Not so fast!"" Axel shouted as she ran up to them.

""Quick, get moving before it burns up!"" Dawn urged Tyler.

""But-"" Tyler tried to object before Noah outright shoved him forward, forcing him onto the rungs of the ladder.

""No time,"" Noah told him, sliding in between Scott and Axel and the base of the ladder and moving as he did to keep his path blocked. ""You have to win this!"" he looked towards Tyler, and the klutz sighed before finally running.

That moment of distraction allowed Axel to push him to the ground, but before she could make it onto the ladder, it started disintegrating into ash. All four helpers gasped, and the music briefly became dangerous as the camera followed Tyler across the rapidly-crumbling ladder. Just before the wood under his feet fell away, he jumped, and the music turned triumphant as he landed safely on the other side.

""Sorry!"" Noah barked out a laugh as the shot returned to him looking back at Axel, ""but you failed.""

""Yes, we weren't able to stop Tyler,"" Axel sighed, the perspective rotating so that the camera was looking up at her. ""But we can stop him from having helpers.""

""I'm just here to help MK,"" Scott said. ‚ÄúAnd we can't rejoin her.‚Äù

""At this point, the best way to help MK is to hinder Tyler,"" Axel added.

""Not if I got anything to say about it!"" Noah said before tackling Axel to the ground.

As the two continued to fight off-screen, the camera panned to the right to show Dawn and Scott watching in helpless apathy.

The shot cut back to MK as she looked at the pink pogo stick one more time and groaned. ""I can't believe I have to use the pogo stick,"" she told herself.

""Keep in mind,"" Chris called out from a lawn chair on the ground below, ""not all of these items were tested for safety. And, by 'not all', I mean none."" A telephone began ringing faintly off-camera. ""Each one is a deathtrap just waiting to-"" He was cut off when the female intern arrived baring a new cellphone. She answered it for him and held it to his ear, and the person on the other end yelled. ""Should I reword that?"" he asked it.

""Yes!"" Caleb cheered back at the spa hotel. ""MK's in the lead!""

""Too bad she's out of helpers,"" Jasmine pointed out.

""And Tyler still has his hanging around?"" Alejandro asked.

""It's still too early to decide who has the clear advantage,"" Brick mused to himself.

A flash took the scene up to the final moat, the camera looking out at the edge of the tier as Tyler hauled himself up. ""Tyler makes it to level three!"" Chris announced, prompting a whooping cheer from the jock. ""MK better spring into action!"" he added as the shot cut down to the AV girl determinedly bouncing up and down on the pogo stick.

She growled. ""Here,"" she said, the camera in a fixed position close-up as she sprang up. ""I,"" she sprang up again. ""Come!"" She came up, went back down again, and with the next spring upward, the shot zoomed out to show her arcing over the moat towards the edge of the third level. Screaming, she let go of the pogo stick in mid-air and just barely landed in the swamp water.

The scene panned down and to the left, showing Noah and Axel wrestling on the ground. ""Let go!"" the bookworm cried as the survivalist had him in a headlock.

""Not a chance,"" Axel replied.

The music became tense and ominous as the scene flashed back to the third moat as MK swam over to Tyler. ""You're still here?"" she asked. ""Did you decide to give up?""

""No I didn't,"" Tyler shot back. ""This seaweed is the only place the sharks won't come after me.""

""Sharks?"" MK repeated in confusion before swimming next to her opponent. ""As in more than one?"" The camera pulled back to show about five regular shark fins circling around a patch of seaweed that contained the two finalists. ""CHRIS!"" she shouted in anger. ""I thought we were just gonna have to deal with Fang up here!""

The shot cut to the host, still standing at ground level. He laughed into his megaphone, then said ""Yeah, well, Fang hasn't really been as big a threat as he used to be, so, I decided to add something extra to the third moat. And the sharks from the first episode still had some time left in their contract."" He laughed again. ""Don't know why they won't go into the seaweed though.""

""Well, guess that means we're in the clear,"" MK said with a small smile.

""Yeah, but how are we supposed to get to the other side of the moat like this?"" Tyler asked.

As Tyler finished speaking, the shot panned to the left, where Fang had removed one of his teeth and swam over to the finalists with a menacing smile.

The challenge music resumed as the scene cut back to Axel and Noah, the bookworm throwing knees at the survivalist that only served to force her backwards along the rim of the second moat with a lazy expression.

""I'm surprised you're not giving up easily like usual,"" Axel taunted as she turned a punch aside with her arm. ""Have you not realized by now that you can't beat me?""

""I'm not giving up on this rare occasion,"" Noah said as he continued his assault.

""I see,"" Axel said, raising an eyebrow as she continued to block, dodge, and step backwards.

""Why'd you stop?"" Noah asked. ""Are you scared to fight back?""

""Not really, to be honest,"" Axel admitted. ""I don't need to change how things are.""

Noah narrowed his eyes, paused, and gasped. ""Wait a minute, you're just stalling!""

The camera cut to Scott and Dawn as the moonchild's face turned into a cocky grin of her own. ""And as long as you two stall us, MK has no helpers. And we think she's going to lose in a one-on-one battle.""

Axel snorted in contempt. ""You're bluffing!""

""I kinda have to agree with the newbies, newbie,"" Scott chimed in. ""MK's not much of a brawler. Also, shouldn't one of them have won by now?""

The four helpers stopped in their tracks and a simultaneous scream from the third tier caught their attention.

""Tyler!"" Dawn cried out in concern.

""MK!"" Scott cried out in fear.

The four looked at each other. ""Truce?"" Axel asked.

""Truce,"" Noah agreed.

The music became even more intense and dramatic as the scene flashed back to Tyler and MK huddled together in a much lighter patch of seaweed, Fang still grinning as he cut away at the plants protecting the two.

""Okay, now's a good time,"" Tyler said.

""For what?"" MK asked incredulously.

""A plan to get us out of here,"" Tyler replied. ""You're one of the brainiest players around.""

""Well unfortunately, I don't have any ideas,"" MK replied.

The music spiked suddenly as Fang was shown cutting down another bit of seaweed.

""That does not look good,"" Shawn commented as the Peanut Gallery all sat on the edges of their seats.

""No wonder the lawyers didn't green light this challenge!"" Emma cried.

The scene cut back to the finalists with just the barest minimum of seaweed surrounding them. The five regular sharks and Fang all surfaced, grinned, then swam at them as they held each other and screamed.

Luckily, a shout caught the attention of everyone present. ""Excuse me!"" The sharks and the camera turned to show Scott standing at the edge of the moat. ""I'm a much better meal than those two!""

The normal sharks, minus Fang, swam over to the devious farmer with grins. But before they could get close enough to do anything, Axel surfaced from under the water and punched one in the nose with her fist.

The other sharks were shaken from their trance, and moved to attack the survivalist. However, with a sharp spike in the music, Axel was shown punching another shark in the gut against a green sunburst background; then a third in the teeth against an orange sunburst; and finally grabbing the fourth by the tailfin and slamming it into the fifth against a red sunburst.

""Who's up for another round?"" Axel asked with a smug grin.

The sharks, now all sporting black-eyes and missing teeth, all quickly swam away while barking like seals. Fang, having seen all of this, turned from the survivalist to the finalists, then took a stack of papers and tore them in half before swimming away with his normal brethren.

Confessional: Tyler

""That was pretty cool of Axel to save us like that,"" Tyler confessed. ""I guess she's not completely heartless.""

Confessional Ends

A calm tune played as Axel and Tyler fist bumped, and the camera panned over to show Scott and MK high fiving.

""I knew I made a smart choice having you as a helper and a friend,"" MK told Scott.

The shot cut to Dawn and Noah back at the edge of the second moat. ""I guess we weren't needed after all,"" Dawn shrugged.

""Everybody stop,"" Chris yelled, the music suddenly becoming tense and plodding as he flew over to them on his jetpack. ""This is the finale. It's supposed to be about pain and betrayal, and pain,"" he told them. ""Not friendship. PAIN!""

‚ÄúTell that to someone who cares, McLean!‚Äù Scott shouted.

""That's it! New rule!"" Chris said, the camera following him as he flew upward. ""Anyone who gets the sword out of the stone wins the million dollars.""

The shot cut back to Noah and Dawn looking up in shock. ""I'm not going to do this,"" Dawn told Noah.

""Same here,"" Noah said. ‚ÄúThis isn't my finale.‚Äù

""You two should probably leave before I get any ideas,"" Axel told the Final Two.

""You're not going to stop us?"" Tyler asked suspiciously.

‚ÄúHeck no!‚Äù Scott said.

""I would if people I hated completely like Alejandro and Heather were finalists,"" Axel admitted with a shrug. ""I don't have anything against you two as much.""

""Now get going!"" Scott demanded.

The shot cut back to MK and Tyler, both looking stunned. They turned their gazes towards one another, and smirked as the background music started to rise up again, eerie at first before becoming intense and dramatic and even dangerous.

""See you at the top!"" Tyler taunted.

""Yeah, I'll be the one with the sword!"" MK replied as the two swam in opposite directions ‚Äì MK to the left and Tyler to the right.

Confessional: Dawn

‚ÄúThis finale is much more dangerous than the last, but I'm grateful that Mother Earth gave me the opportunity to assist my friends,‚Äù Dawn smiled.

Confessional Ends

The music was deep and dramatic as the scene moved to the two finalists climbing the final ladders in split-screen, MK on the left and Tyler on the right.

MK screamed as soon as she reached the top, ducking back down to avoid a blast of pasta. The shot zoomed out as Chef fired off another two blasts, then moved back in again as MK grit her teeth and jumped up onto the final platform. She gracefully rolled into cover behind a nearby rock before the spot she'd been standing on was hit with pasta.

Chef was shown turning his focus back to the left and firing, the shot cutting to Tyler standing on the raised rim of the tier as he quickly ducked under the blast. He landed on the ground and ran off with a bright, cocky grin.

""Ooh, some impressive maneuvers from both Tyler and MK!"" Chris said in excitement, the shot cutting to him flying over to Chef as the 'king' fired a few more pasta volleys in Tyler's direction. ""And unimpressive shooting from Chef,"" the host scolded, causing Chef to shoot him with pasta instead, hurling him away.

The camera panned down to the sword and zoomed out to show both finalists racing towards it at about the same speed. ""I'm not losing this time!"" Tyler cried out.

The shot cut back to Chef as he grinned, took aim, and fired, the camera following behind the pasta ball as it sailed straight towards the klutz. Tyler's eyes widened and he screamed just as the blast hit him. The shot followed him as he hit the ground with his head covered in pasta, then panned back to MK as she continued her run.

The music ramped up even more as she ran, determination in her eyes as she jumped and ducked out of the way of Chef's pasta blasts. She soon reached the miniature castle, and the shot briefly cut to Chef as he gasped in shock and the music cut out.

With an almost ethereal shimmering sound, The Techno Girl pulled the Sword of Victory from the stone and raised it skyward, a close-up showing it gleaming against a radiant sky. ""Boom! Score one for Mary-Kate!"" she cheered, seemingly overwhelmed by excitement as a triumphant melody began to play.

The shot panned to the right a little ways to show Chris landing nearby with the briefcase full of prize money in hand. ""MK wins the million dollars!"" he announced as he walked over to the ecstatic techno.

""Congrats,"" The Klutz said with a smile as the shot cut to him wiping pasta off his face. ""You won.""

The sound of the bazooka firing drew the camera back to MK to show that she'd been hit with a pasta blast, quickly wiping it off her face and glaring upwards at Chef. ""Hehehehe...,"" the large man snickered before noticing the attention he'd attracted. ""Uh, I was just cleaning it and it went off,"" he lied.

""Guess you and me are both a duo of winners,"" Scott said as he and Axel suddenly walked over from the right.

""Not bad,"" Axel said with a smirk.

""Thanks,"" MK told them with a happy smirk, accepting a hug from Scott and a handshake from Axel. ""I still can't believe I finally did it!""

The camera panned onto Chris as his cellphone rang, the triumphant music cutting off. He frowned, took it out of his pocket, and groaned. ""Uggh, it's the network,"" he said before answering it. ""Yyyees?"" He was greeted by another round of angry yelling. ""Uh-huh?"" he replied with a smile and a nod. A pan to the left showed Dawn and Noah arriving with smiles on their faces. ""Uhh-huh?"" the host repeated off-screen. ""Okay!"" he said excitedly as the camera cut back to him. ""Done!""

""They're so happy,"" he told the cast as he ended the call, ""that they want to go straight into a new season with an all-new cast!"" As he spoke, faint but ominous music began to play...

An explosion suddenly went off, shaking the entire area. The shot cut to the stone pedestal the sword had been stuck in to show steam billowing forth from the crack, and the shaking didn't stop.

""Umm...,"" Chris said with wide, nervous eyes, ""what's going on?""

""Uh Chef,"" Noah asked as the shot cut to him and Dawn, the moonchild looking around anxiously, ""what did you use to make those moats?""

""A fracking machine,"" Chef answered with a hint of confusion and alarm in his voice.

""Whoa!"" Axel said in shocked disbelief.

""You can't say that on TV!"" Scott added.

""No, a fracking machine is a hydraulic drill,"" Noah explained. ""Using one on an island this small is incredibly dangerous!"" the bookworm added with growing panic.

""Why?"" Chris asked as steam spurted out of the sword-stone. ""What...what could happen?""

He was answered by a jet of water spurting out of the stone. ""THE ISLAND IS SINKING!"" Dawn cried out in terror, an ominous note playing over the screams of all.

The music cut out abruptly as the scene moved to Sasquatchanakwa whistling contently as he walked along the Dock of Shame with a rolled-up newspaper under his arm. As he reached the Flush of Shame, the earth began to rumble and shake, and the grand yet ominous 'Dies Irae' section of Mozart's requiem began as water suddenly gushed out of the bowl.

Another waterspout sent the confessional outhouse flying into the air, and a third shot out of one of the mine entrances. A buck deer looked up from the grass it was grazing on with a worried look, only for a yet another sudden geyser to erupt under a nearby rock and frighten it away. More water came bursting out of a tree hollow as a raccoon and a rat ran past in opposite directions, with more and more spouts appearing in the distance as a bear, a rabbit, and a bull moose fled in terror as well... and a squirrel maniacally cackling as it held up a sign of the Earth exploding.

The scene moved to the old mess hall as water broke through the windows and chimney, a violin being played poorly nearby. The door burst open, and the three remaining interns rode out riding the torrent on a fold-out table ‚Äì the girl out front holding a mop like a weapon; the fat boy in the middle trembling in fear; and the long-banged boy in the back holding on to a bucket. The common area was shown next, the loser cabin nearly submerged save for the roof and the spa hotel showing only the second story. Water was gushing from every window, and had even busted a massive hole in the roof of the cabin. The spa hotel's butler was revealed as the violin player, standing in the middle of the screaming Peanut Gallery on a spa hotel balcony before another spout of water engulfed them all.

The camera cut outward to show the entirety of what remained of Wawanakwa, half-flooded and still spurting water. A deep drumroll played as the whole island shook one last time, leading into a tremendous and dramatic crash as it abruptly sank the rest of the way, sending up a gigantic backsplash.

A fast yet dark tune started playing as the scene moved down to the water, now filled with all sort of rubble ‚Äì wood, tires, furniture, bottles, dead fish, branches, and Chef sipping coffee out of his thermos. Heather surfaced with a gasp and a splutter, followed by the rest of the Peanut Gallery except for Beardo.

""Can someone explain to me what just happened?"" Heather said with a hint of panic.

""I'm not sure,"" Alejandro replied.

""How are we supposed to get home?"" Caleb asked before noticing the finalists and their helpers floating by on the roof of the loser cabin.

""One thing's for sure,"" MK said. ""I'm not coming back to this show again unless I have to.""

""Agreed,"" Tyler said, and as they floated out of frame, the outhouse floated in with Chris sitting on it and holding the case of money.

""Well, that's it for our very first All-Star season,"" he said with a friendly wave as the series's capstone theme began to play. ""But, don't worry~! We're coming back with a brand new cast! And I guess a brand new island, too,"" he added with a thoughtful look around and chuckle. ""Until next time, I'm Chris McLean, and this has been Total!"" The shot jumped backward a few feet. ""Drama!"" Another backward jump showed the roof of the loser cabin floating by. ""All-Stars!"" The final jump-cut showed more floating debris.

Then the music rolled into something far more fun and energetic as the camera pulled back, and the Boat of Losers drove past with countless forest animals on board ‚Äì bears, deer, squirrels, raccoons, skunks, rabbits, moose, turtles, alligators, and even seagulls. The horn was sounded, and the boat sped off with Beardo towed behind it on water skis.

(Bonus Clip)

""You know,"" Beardo said as the clip faded in on him treading water. ""After everything that's happened, I'm glad I wasn't even considered an option to compete in this season.""

As he spoke, a shark fin swam up behind him. ""I'm no big time player or anything, but I know my performance is better than Staci's. I can't wait to go back home and get back to my DJ'ing job- huh?"" The shark fin tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around.

""Uh-oh! Gotta go!"" He made a motorboat engine sound before swimming away at impossible speed. The shark fin revealed itself to be Fang, who snickered and swam away.

Episode 13: The Final Wreck-ening

""This season, on Total Drama All-Stars! Fourteen competitors returned for another shot at one. Million. Dollars.""

""Your favorite Heroes and Villains battled for supremacy in our most painful and grueling challenges ever.""

""And, it was a season full of mind-numbing surprises. MK abandoned her teammates to help Caleb. Heather lost her immunity idol. Shawn was given the boot by a hidden force! And Alejandro was right there, the man behind it all.""

""In the end, though, Jasmine gave Alejandro what was coming to him, only to be flushed alongside him.""

""After twelve killer challenges,"" Chris said, standing on the dock in his baby blue tuxedo, ""we're down to our Final Two players. Who will take home the million dollar prize?"" The camera pulled back and panned over to show Chef Hatchet standing by with the suitcase of prize money; he opened it, but rather than the lid popping up, the bottom dropped out, causing the cash to fall onto the dock. ""Aww, dude!"" Chris scolded as Chef smiled sheepishly.

The host cleared his throat and adjusted his bow tie. ""Will it be Tyler, the underdog king?"" he asked as the klutz's smirking portrait slid into the entire right half of the screen, a snowy mountain behind it. ""Or MK, the semi-reformed queen?"" The techno girl's smirking portrait took over the left side of the screen, a blazing fire behind it.

""Find out right here, right now, on the season finale of! Total! Drama! All-Stars!""

(Theme Song)

A deep drumroll led into a grandiose theme, the episode opening on a shot of the spa hotel before cutting inside to a pan across what looked like some kind of gym. A few grunts preceded Tyler's appearance on-screen, standing before a punching bag. ""Okay dude, this is the day you've been waiting for ever since you first came onto the show,"" he told himself, moving back and forth in a boxing stance and delivering a few swift punches to the bag. ""You gotta be in peak physical condition if you wanna bring home that title.‚Äù

Confessional: Tyler

Tyler was spinning around his yo-yo as the confessional began. ""It took me two seasons,"" he told the camera, ""but I'm finally about to win. MK may be easier to beat than Jasmine or Alejandro, but I've worked too hard to lose now, and I'm not going to underestimate her.""

He put the yo-yo in his pocket. ""But still, I can‚Äôt believe how far I‚Äôve come. I went from a total klutz to a guy who‚Äôs still a klutz, but is more coordinated, determined, and stronger. My first plan for the money is starting my own baseball team if I win, and good sportsmanship is something I want to instill in my players.""

""Dakota, wish me luck. I love you.""

Confessional Ends

A muted version of the previous grandiose theme began to play again as the scene moved to show MK jogging through the forest.

The camera cut in close as she took in deep breaths. ""Exercising is something that I normally don‚Äôt do, but for this occasion, it‚Äôs necessary.""

Confessional: MK

""I know I'm smarter and tactful than Tyler,"" MK confessed, ""but I also know that he's faster and more built, so we're pretty much even. But I think I've got a good chance at winning, yeah. After losing out on the finale three seasons ago, I'm pretty eager to show that I've got what it takes to actually win. I may be a better person now, and I am getting tired of bringing that up, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna back down.""

""I need to win this show. Not just for me, but for my family, Caleb, the people I made friends with or am already friends with here, and even Ripper and Sam,"" she declared with an intense look in her eyes. ""I‚Äôve proven that I can change and play the game fairly, and the money can help improve my home and personal life. Wish me luck.""

Confessional Ends

""Good morning, finalists!"" Chris announced over the camp loudspeaker. ""Meet me in the forest clearing, and get ready to diet!"" He paused. ""Sorry, typo,"" he corrected. ""Ready to die!"" he said, a sharp note playing on his correction.

The scene flashed to the Final Two walking along the path at a leisurely pace. ""So, thanks again for taking me to the finale with you,"" MK said.

""No worries, MK,"" Tyler told her with a smile. ""We haven‚Äôt bonded much, especially during our alliance with Dawn, but I'm happy to be competing against you. Besides, like I said last night, it wouldn't be fair to make Jasmine compete after she got injured.""

MK raised an eyebrow. ""Well then, what would've happened if she hadn't gotten hurt?""

Tyler raised an eyebrow and gave her a look before sighing. ""Personally, I still would‚Äôve picked you. Jasmine‚Äôs more heroic than you, sure, but I figured you deserve it more after what you‚Äôve been through this season thanks to Alejandro, and you would likely do the same back.""

""You‚Äôre right about that,"" MK agreed. ‚ÄúIf she wasn‚Äôt injured, I would‚Äôve flushed her just to get back at her a little for how she treated me, and she‚Äôs extremely physical. Much more than you.‚Äù

""No need to rub it in,"" Tyler chuckled. ""Cause I‚Äôm getting super focused and winning this thing,"" he said before racing ahead with a confident smile on his face.

MK rolled her eyes with a smile of her own, racing after him.

Confessional: MK

""Now I can see why Dakota likes that clumsy guy,"" MK said with a grin. ‚ÄúIf me and Tyler didn't have significant others, I might date him.‚Äù

Confessional Ends

The footage resumed on a shot of the Final Two standing before a dark magenta curtain suspended between two trees. Chris was standing in front of it, and Chef was standing by his side.

""Congratulations on making it to the finale,"" the host began. ""It's something you'll regret for the rest of your lives,"" he said with a frown as the shot cut in for a close-up, ""which will likely be rather short, since this final challenge is sooo vicious,"" a sharp note was struck as the camera cut in closer, ""sooo brutal,"" another sharp note and another cut closer, ""sooo savage!"" A dramatic tune played as the Final Two exchanged a worried look. ""That our lawyers said we had to change it,"" the host admitted as a few lighter, almost joking notes played and the two campers let out breaths of relief.

""So...you made it less deadly, right?"" Tyler asked.

""No,"" Chris answered with a smile, ""but we told them we did."" He laughed, then turned to Chef. ""High five!"" he said, jovially raising his left hand.

Chef just stared at him, and he faltered. ""People gonna die,"" Chef said.

""Yeah,"" Chris said, putting his hands on his hips in mild annoyance, ""those people."" The Final Two shared another wary look. ""Combatants, choose your weapon!""

The curtain opened to reveal a wooden wall with numerous weapons mounted to it. Many of them were ranged: Chef's pasta blaster, a harpoon gun with a fish stuck on the end, a couple different models of paintball guns, a bow and arrow set, a multi-barreled leech gun, a slingshot, and even Mr. Coconut was joined by a boomerang, and tennis racket, and an oven mitt of all things.

""So, what'll it be?"" Chris asked before the camera moved in for a downward panning close-up of the weapons. ""Meatball bazooka? Bow and blunt-tipped arrows? A leech gun? A slingshot? Or...why is there an oven mitt there?!"" he asked incredulously.

The shot zoomed out a little as Chef ran over and grabbed the mitt. ""...there was an extra hook,"" he sheepishly told the camera.

Another close-up showed MK grabbing the leech gun, then Tyler taking the slingshot.

""Now that you've got your weapons,"" Chris said, the finalists standing next to him getting a feel for what they'd chosen, ""you'll need them to pop these balloons."" The camera followed up and to the side to show a number of large orange balloons floating in the air. ""Each one contains a previously-flushed All-Star,"" the host explained as the shot panned on to the right, showing all twelve of the balloons.

""Wait? What?"" MK exclaimed in dull shock.

""They can breathe in there, right?"" Tyler asked in concern.

""I don't know,"" Chris shrugged. ""Ask our competitor Beardo. He filled them."" He pointed to the side again where The Human Soundboard was sitting around with an open box of balloons, a stand-up bicycle pump, a gargantuan can of beans, and several unlabeled gas tanks.

""For the record,"" Beardo told the camera, ""the beans are just for breakfast. Filling the balloons with farts is really messed up.""

""You have thirty seconds,"" Chris told them as the focus moved back to him. ""Any All-Star you shoot down, becomes your helper. Aaaaaand,"" he said, raising his airhorn as the two readied their weapons, ""GO!""

He blew the airhorn, and the music began to rise into something hectic and stilted as the two began. Tyler was first, drawing back and firing his slingshot with one eye closed, then the shot moved to MK as she unleashed a barrage of leeches.

""That didn't work,"" Tyler grunted in disappointment after the rock sailed right past three of the balloons.

The shot cut to a single leech flying through the air and striking one of the balloons.

It burst, and Axel fell screaming into the large patch of shrubs below. ""I got her?"" MK complained before Tyler frowned and fired another stone.

It slammed into a balloon and popped it, sending Noah screaming downward. ""He can be helpful,"" Tyler commented before readying another stone.

The shot cut to MK watching her opponent, then going back to firing. ""Come on! Give me Caleb!"" she said to herself as she fired another leech, and the camera immediately cut close to follow it as it struck a balloon.

The balloon burst, revealing none other than Scott, who screamed as he fell into the bushes.

""It‚Äôs not Caleb, but yes!"" MK cheered as the shot cut back to her and Tyler.

""MK picks up Axel and Scott,"" Chris announced with an impish smile. ""Tyler,"" he turned to the side, ""you might wanna hurry up.""

""What do you think I‚Äôm doing?"" Tyler said with an annoyed scowl before firing his slingshot again. The stone popped a bubble to reveal Dawn, who calmly meditated as she fell.

Tyler smiled, and the airhorn was sounded again. ""Time's up!"" Chris announced. ""And time to see if any of them survived the landing,"" he added with a chuckle before walking towards the bushes.

""Hold on,"" MK said with a concerned look, giving him pause. ""Shouldn't we get the others down first?""

""Already covered,"" Chris said. The camera cut to the balloons as without warning, large globs of pasta and sauce were fired at them popping and releasing all the losers.

""Now I know why you wanted us to tie them down first,"" Chris said as the shot cut back to him and Chef, the latter holding the meatball bazooka.

It was then that a ringing came from the host's pocket, and he pulled out his cellphone. ""Huh, it's the lawyers!"" he said, checking the screen. He looked around shiftily, then smiled. ""I'm gonna let it go to voicemail...,"" he said, putting the phone back in his pocket. ""Okay! Let's go!"" he said as he walked away.

Confessional: MK

""I wasn‚Äôt able to get Caleb as a helper, but I did get Scott, and that would make me glad, but I also got Axel,"" MK moaned. ""I just can't see her working with me and Scott too well. I might have to get a little forceful with her so she doesn't try anything.""

Confessional Ends

""Axel and Scott,"" Chris announced over a shot of the four helpers and eight others standing up in the bushes, ""you will be helping MK."" The shot cut to the twelve of them walking over to the host and finalists. ""Dawn and Noah, you're on Team Tyler. But, you four are here as helpers. Only. Meaning, you can't win.""

Axel just shrugged.

""Meaning no money,"" Chris clarified.

Axel once again didn't react.

""Zero money,"" Chris told her. ""Plenty of pain."" Having had enough of Axel's calmness, he yelled directly in the survivalist's face with a megaphone. ""AXEL! CAN YOU HEAR ME?!""

Axel gritted her teeth in displeasure. ""Yes Chris. I hear you,"" the latina told him. ""I'm perfectly fine with the rules.""

Chris raised an eyebrow. ""Wait, what?""

Confessional: Axel

‚ÄúI would normally be upset about not being able to win the money, but after being away from the show for a while, I came to the realization that Scott is right about me screwing up my own chances in my finale,‚Äù Axel confessed. ‚ÄúI can't keep blaming others, and I'm here to help, not steal the prize for myself.‚Äù

Confessional Ends

""As for the rest of you,"" Chris addressed the non-helping losers, ""there's a season five wrap party in the spa hotel.""

The eight former all-stars headed to the spa hotel while cheering, while Noah and Scott grumbled.

Confessional: Scott

""The others get to party,"" Scott complained. ""But I'm stuck possibly dying. How's that for fun? But this is for MK, and she needs all the help she can get from a duo of previous finalists.""

Confessional Ends

The footage skipped ahead to show the finalists, helpers, and host riding through the forest in an open-topped tram. Chris was standing in the front wile the female intern drove; Tyler, Noah, and Dawn sat in the second car; and MK, Axel, and Scott sat in the third.

""Tyler, MK,"" Chris began, ""this season I decided to come up with something reeeeally danger-uhhh,"" he hesitated, ""I mean, special. Yeah! Special!"" The shot cut to the two teams watching with mild annoyance and disbelief. ""For the both of you. Say hello,"" he turned as the tram came to a stop, ""to the final challenge of Total Drama All-Stars!""

The music rose ominously and the shot rapidly pulled backed to show a massive, rounded, three-tiered stone structure with ladders at various points along the side of each level. A moat of something bright green surrounded the base of it, the air above the first level was glowing a faint red, and at the very top was a smaller structure like a crenelated castle archway. ""The Moats of Doom!"" the host said, laughing as bolts of lightning struck the area.

A six-way split-screen showed the finalists and helpers gasping dramatically as the music spiked.

""Each level has a sliver of safe-ish ground,"" Chris explained as the shot moved closer to the base of the structure and slowly started to pan up, ""where you'll find tools to help you survive the insane dangers that await you in each moat.""

The shot cut to the first moat, filled with a familiar bubbling green substance. ""The first moat, at ground level,"" the host explained, ""is filled with toxic waste. You might wanna avoid falling in,"" he said as a fly buzzed into view and dipped down into the bubbling waste. ""Unless you wanna get a job as a circus freak."" The fly emerged, now gigantic.

""Moat number two is,"" Chris continued as the shot panned up to the next moat, filled with something orange and smoldering, ""boiling hot lava!"" The mutant fly flew over and tried to dip down into it, only to catch on fire and fly off with a shriek.

Another quick-pan upward put the camera on a thin patch of murky, plant-filled water. ""The third moat is just plain-old swamp water,"" Chris said as the fly reappeared once more, soaking its flaming body in the water. ""But, what lies beneath...,"" he added as Fang suddenly shot up and swallowed the fly whole, ""will definitely kill you.""

The shot cut back to Team Tyler as Dawn and Noah gasped.

Confessional: Noah

""Y'know, floating off into the sun is looking much better than doing whatever death defying challenge this is,"" Noah confessed.

Confessional Ends

""MK, Tyler,"" Chris said, the finalists and their helpers now disembarked, ""if you somehow survive all three moats, you must say goodbye to your helpers and go it alone as you storm the castle."" The scene moved to the top of the tiered structures, a quick-pan taking the scene to the crenelated four-arched castle with Chef standing at the top under a cloudy sky. ""Take your life in your hands as you fight your way past the Mad King,"" the shot zoomed in on the large man, dressed in a spotted fur cloak and a golden crown and drinking from a thermos of coffee.

""I am the Mad King,"" Chef said unenthusiastically. ""Argh."" He poured some more coffee into the lid from the thermos and took a sip.

""If you get past the Mad King and find the strength to pull the Sword of Victory from the stone,"" the shot panned down to a golden-hilted longsword sticking out of a stone below the castle arches, ""you are the true Total Drama All-Star!"" A short tune of victory played as the sword gleamed in the light. ""And the winner of,"" the shot cut back to the excited host, ""One! Million! Dollars!"" The open case of prize money was shown against a glittering and radiant background, coming closer to the camera with each word.

""Subject to all applicable taxes and other offsets required by law,"" the host added quickly under his breath.

""So? Excited?"" Chris asked impishly over a shot of Team MK looking rather shocked.

""And I thought avoiding those mutated freaks was hard,"" Axel commented. ""This is probably the most dangerous finale ever.""

""Actually, I'd say it's about on par with the one from season three, and I participated in it,"" Scott said. ""But we're going to overcome these obstacles and make MK the winner of this season.""

MK looked at Axel warily. ""As long as everyone's on-board with this,"" MK said.

Axel shrugged. ""I'm contractually-obligated to help you. So I will,"" she admitted. ""Besides, you losing because I didn't help you enough would blow,"" she said with another shrug.

""I'm holding you to that,"" MK told her.

The focus panned over to Tyler, watching the three with a focused look. ""I hope I can win this thing.""

""Tyler, after all this time, you're holding on to hope?"" Noah asked as the camera panned over to include him and Dawn in the shot.

""He's right,"" Dawn chimed in. ""You have to give this your all, and show the world you have what it takes to win.""

""You're right!"" Tyler said determinedly. ""Only one person's gonna win, and it's gonna be me!""

""Wow,"" Chris said as the camera cut back to him. ""Will anyone survive the final challenge?"" he asked as the capstone theme began to play. ""If yes, who will be our winner? Find out right after the break, here on Total! Drama! All-Stars!""

I've been trawling this subreddit for recommendations for a bottle/travel mug to carry everyday and couldn't really find  what I was looking for so thought I'd just ask.

I'm looking to buy a waterbottle/travel b=mug that I can carry to work (I commute by either bike or bus dependeing on the weather). Ideally I'd like it to be a waterbottle with some insulation that I can occasionally use for te/coffee if I'm travelling by bus. I'd prefer something made of metal that is easy to clean.  
The 'Hitch bottle'  looked really good, but it seems to be no longer available and I saw some poor reviews online.

I really like the design of the 750ml [Ocean Bottle](https://oceanbottle.co/collections/750ml?pb=0) the double openeing makes it really good for cleaning and for drinking beverages, and the build quality is great, but I think 40 quid is quite pricey for a waterbottle.

I am now thinking of getting [this](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/primus/slurken-travel-mug/_/R-p-0980ebca-64af-410c-9dfa-8f27980284a2?mc=fc9bf129-d610-4a0a-9ad0-c63742f52392&c=silver) travel mug from Primus  since it's on sale, even though it's a bit smaller than I would've liked.

Any recommendations are much appreciated!!

1kya0ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1kya0ja/upgrading_turin_sd40_burrs/,Upgrading Turin sd40 burrs,"I own a xeoleo 017 coffee grinder, a grinder identical to the Turin sd40.

**about the grinder:**  
 It comes with 40mm conical burrs and the motor achives 800 rpm, 150W over 220V. 

**background:**   
I mostly brew pour-over/ immersion methods. and I am satisfied with it's grinding results though i do mind that it produces a lot of fines that make noticeable difference when brewing cold-brew or French press (col brew  clarity is noticeably cloudier, so currently i filtering the brew with clever after letting it steep in the Karaf).

**possible solutions:**  
1) lowering rpm by adding an additional gear or replacing the gear.  
2) changing burr set to flat set (I happens to see that the itop40 plus (different model and specs) can replace its burr set to flat burrs and I was wondering if it‚Äôs feasible to apply on the sd40). 

  
**note:**  
Do not concern my machine health, as i am willing to take the risk since it was a cheap machine. The base of the machine can be easily modified to be more stable and the motor can be replaced or modified with different gears. So I‚Äôm not concerned about the consequences of the burr mod.",2,1748523139.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

I started with their mutton smash burger. The toasted bun was a standout, and the patty had a nice, juicy bite and was topped with some melted cheese slice and a little bit of sauce. That said, the portion was underwhelming. You‚Äôll likely need some sides or another burger to feel full.

This is the stage in healing that feels quiet, almost invisible. It‚Äôs not the heartbreak, not the tears, not the ache of missing¬†*them.*¬†It‚Äôs the part where you‚Äôve truly moved on. You‚Äôve made peace with the ending. You understand, deeply, that it wasn‚Äôt meant to last. And you‚Äôre okay with that.

And I am. I really am.

I like who I‚Äôm becoming. I like my routines, my silly little habits, my quiet mornings with tea and a book. I like how I take myself out for coffee, and dinners. I‚Äôve built a soft, meaningful life for myself‚Äîone full of warmth and growth and quiet joys. I‚Äôm not looking for someone to complete me. I‚Äôm whole.

But still‚Ä¶ some nights.  
Especially lately.

I find myself craving something simpler, quieter than love.

I crave¬†*companionship*. The comfort of being around someone who sees you‚Äînot just the version you show the world, but the little things. Someone who notices how you hum while making dinner, how your eyes light up when you talk about that one random thing you‚Äôre passionate about. Someone who laughs at your weird jokes. Someone who‚Äôs just...¬†*there.*

Not romance. Not drama. Just presence.

I miss the shared silences. Sharing a meal without needing to fill every second with conversation. Sitting on the couch, legs tangled, watching a show you don‚Äôt even like that much because the company makes it better. Sharing a knowing look when something funny happens. That feeling of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, and so are you, and this moment matters, even if we say nothing.‚Äù

Some nights I come home and I know I‚Äôll turn the key, step inside, and the house will be quiet. Peaceful, but also‚Ä¶ a little lonely. And I‚Äôll sit with myself, like I always do. I‚Äôll light a candle, play music, maybe read a chapter of something lovely. And I‚Äôll feel grateful for my own company‚Äîbecause I‚Äôve earned that comfort.

But there‚Äôs still a little corner of my heart that whispers,  
*Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to share this?*

Not because I need to, but because I¬†*want*¬†to.  
Because sometimes, the deepest yearning isn‚Äôt for grand love stories‚Äîbut for someone to look at you across the table, smile softly, and stay. Someone who chooses you in the little ways. Who reaches for your hand just because.

So yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy on my own.  
But I miss being gently known.  
And if you‚Äôre in this space too‚Äîif your heart is healing, whole, and still softly hoping‚Äîjust know you‚Äôre not alone.

I wrote a poem about this part of the journey. If you‚Äôve ever felt it too, I hope these words find you in a kind and healing way.

**Whole, But Still Hoping**

I‚Äôve built a life that feels like mine,  
With morning walks and books and time.  
I‚Äôve learned to laugh when no one‚Äôs near,  
To hold myself through every fear.

I set the table just for one,  
I dance alone when day is done.  
The quiet isn‚Äôt quite so loud,  
I wear my solitude like proud.

I smile at sunsets on my own,  
I‚Äôve found a joy I‚Äôve never known.  
And yet‚Ä¶ some nights, a whisper stays‚Äî  
A longing tucked between my days.

Not for a fairytale or flame,  
Not someone just to know my name‚Äî  
But for a voice beside my tea,  
A hand that simply says, ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

Someone to share a tired sigh,  
To sit in silence, you and I.  
A steady heart, a softer gaze,  
A warmth that stays on colder days.

I‚Äôm not undone, I‚Äôm not in need,  
My heart no longer aches to plead.  
But still it beats with something true‚Äî  
The wish to share this life I grew.

And if you feel this quiet too,  
This space where love once gently flew‚Äî  
Then know you‚Äôre not alone tonight.  
We‚Äôre stars apart, but share one light.

If this resonates with you, I‚Äôm sending you so much warmth.  
Even if we‚Äôre healing in our own corners of the world,  
there‚Äôs something beautiful in knowing we‚Äôre not alone in the way we feel.",1,1748522952.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

**Chapter 1 ‚Äì Kuro Hates waking up early.**

Kuro *hated* waking up early. He hated it with every fiber in his being and as the sun peeked in through the curtain, the sound of the alarm still ringing in his ears, Kuro buried his face into the pillow. For now, that soft cloud of fluffy goodness was his best friend. But it wouldn‚Äôt last. It couldn‚Äôt last and for a brief moment he mumbled to himself

‚Äò‚ÄôPlease, just five more minutes‚Äô‚Äô.

It was early spring and Kuro could make out the sound of the birds from the school courtyard outside. On the bedstand there was a photo of a middle-aged couple holding a young boy, just peeking up at the camera. Curious, impatient. Those were the *good days*. The days before the accident. The days before that drunk driver had taken the lived of Kuro's parents. The driver had survived but apparently earned himself a one-way trip into the wheelchair due to a broken back that had rendered the perpetrator paralyzed from the waist. Kuro hadn‚Äôt walked away from the accident unharmed either and as he was lying on the bed, frustrated at having to get up at such an early time in the morning, he kicked his legs into the mattress. Only that only *one foot* ever hit the mattress and a short stump, what remained below the knee on his left leg, followed the motion meagerly.

The alarm bell rang again and Kuro, painstakingly, rose to a sitting position, dangling his stump over the edge of the bed.

‚Äò‚ÄôThe stump has nothing to do with the heart‚Äô, the doctor had told him and while that *was* true, it had felt like a big fake band-aid on the fact that he was now on his own. Only eleven years old, and already mostly independent, not counting the school/orphanage that had taken him in to make sure that, despite being dealt *this hand* in life, at lease his academic endeavors would have a chance to take root and grow. It had already been three years, living like this, of course, with way more support in the beginning, but now people mostly called Kuro in the evening to make sure he was doing okay. That *always* felt so odd. Like, what would you even say?

‚Äò‚ÄôYeah, my parents are dead, I lost my left foot and I live all by myself, abandoned by everyone, but otherwise I‚Äôm doing just fine‚Äô.

Nah, that would never work, would it?

The mundanity of the morning routines followed suite and Kuro went through them mindlessly. Showering, brushing his teeth, putting on his prosthetic, which, from the perspective of the beholder probably would have been the most interesting thing to watch. But in reality, it was simple as putting, well, any other kind of clothing or accessories on. The thing was mainly made out of carbon fiber, making it quite light. The slot that went around the stump were made out of soft, moldable rubber with a small socket acting as the locking mechanism for the prosthetic. But before you put it on you had to cover the stump with two kinds of socks. One made of nylon that was quite stretchy, that made it so that the stump wouldn‚Äôt get sore, and one made out of cotton mainly to add some kind of cushion against the rubber. For Kuro, learning to walk on it had been a process but now, a couple of years later, it was as casual as any other thing. Like riding a bike, figuratively speaking, except the metaphorical ‚Äòbike‚Äô was attached to your leg.

Finally, Kuro finished off his morning chores by sliding a couple pieces of bread into the toaster before opening up the door to the small, French balcony. The sun was out today, which made the early spring seem even more vibrant and, well, fresh. Like all of the dull greys of the winter were rinsed away. Kuro never really reflected on it but he just felt *better* during the sunnier months. Like it was easier to just exist with a lighter mind and a willingness to just let time run its course. To Kuro winter felt like, well, like waking up early and days passed without the spark, the feeling that it really got started. That the world was hibernating and Kuro, being na√Øve enough to persevere when he, in reality, probably should have buried his axe in the fight against the world. Now, with the returning of the sun the days felt like full breaths of fresh air. Like, when you go into the woods or somewhere where the air is *really fresh* to the point where you literally can taste the fragrance and you feel reinvigorated. Ready to face whatever challenges the world has in store for you.

That is what a perfect day would have been like but still, for Kuro, this just wasn‚Äôt it. He was still slightly sleepy, like, in general, and was playing catch-up with the world trying to stay in sync with everything happening and happening just a tad bit too fast for Kuros liking. Watching over the campus courtyard it would all have looked really dull weren‚Äôt it for the sun shining down. The red bricks of the walls and the even red color of the roof shingles were almost hard to look at. The trees were blooming and a couple of cherries were covered in bright, pink petals. Some of them had already fallen to the ground, contrasting against the lawn, the grass a bit faded from the cold of winter. It would take at least a couple of weeks until the lawn was completely green again. It was still early so there were no people out yet, despite the good weather. Classes hadn‚Äôt started yet for the low-graders and for people that did half of their studies from home, like Kuro did, his classes wouldn‚Äôt start until after lunch. Meaning that Kuro had a couple of hours of free time. So the question was, if that was the case, *why* in the world did he go through the pain of going up early, if he had nothing that he needed to attend to. Well, of course, Kuro did *other things* besides studying. Most of the cleaning was done by the school housekeeper. The ones that did things like taking out the garbage, cleaning the toilets and changing the bed dressings every other week but also things like changing the light bulb or any other repairing/replacing that was needed.

But most of the time, the housekeeper visiting Kuro was just to check in on him. Nag a little bit to make sure Kuro did his homework. Occasionally helping out with cooking, doing the dishes or other things that made correspondence feel easier. To be honest, they filled more of a mentor role than just a person purposed for practical maintenance. Someone that filled the void between personal life and school life, tying Kuro to his perception that both aspects were legitimate. It did, however, not make up for the loss of any parents as the sinking truth was that Kuro was on his own. Facing the world as a singular entity against the odds and circumstances of the majority and he knew that he was at a disadvantage.

As Kuro was staring out into the courtyard, daydreaming about all of these things, he overheard the housekeeper, knocking, and then unlocking the door to his apartment. A tall and almost spindly looking man, wearing a plaided skirt and a pair of lightly stained jeans. He had a friendly face featuring a large nose and a mane of dirty blonde hair under his cap.

‚Äò‚ÄôLovely morning isn‚Äôt it‚Äô‚Äô, the man said. His voice sounded deep and rugged. As if the sound of thunder were trying to utter words yet there was a certain friendly tone to it that pulled and nurtured and to Kuro it felt encouraging for some reason.

‚Äò‚ÄôIt‚Äôs not too bad‚Äô, Kuro said, settling down on one of the chairs next to the small kitchen table. Phil (the name of the man) was doing his regular chores, bringing out the kettle to make coffee. To Kuro, it felt comforting in having someone else to rely on taking the larger slice of the social cake. Handing Kuro a helping hand in warming up, getting used to other people in preparation of facing yet another day. Kuro watched as Phil took out butter and jam for the bread still toasting up, mixing with the pleasant smell of the brewing coffee. Kuro *had* tried coffee, but only once, since he had almost sprayed it all over Phil‚Äôs face and it was still unbelievable how something that smelled so *good* could taste that *vial*. It had been all bitter and sour and just *odd* and thinking about it, it made Kuro shiver. Especially when Phil delightfully sipped from his coffee cup. It was decorated with the emblem of some kind of sports team Kuro didn‚Äôt know the name of. To be honest, he wasn‚Äôt sure if Phil was a sports fan at all and to be honest, such things were hard to tell about people. What was even the stereotype? Buff sports guys, wearing revealing tank tops with backwards caps?

Yeah, Phil wasn‚Äôt anything like that and it made sense that that ended up being the thing that made their friendship so special. He was *just Phil*. Not longing to be someone else or going into people with premade assumptions because he just didn‚Äôt care. And that was probably the best thing about him. His honesty and integrity and knowing that you were good just the way you were. *But what if he‚Äôs just acting that way because he feels sorry for me?* Like, it made sense, right? The thought had struck Kuro in the past, questioning the validity of their interactions. Maybe he *did* just pet him but maybe Phil *also* was just looking for someone to share his breakfast with? To tell stories about his family and how he had ended up divorcing his wife a few years back. His adventures as a hobo travelling by train with everything he owned in his backpack, seeing countries far and wide. The integrity in Phil was that his experiences were dominated by the stories of the people that he met and his ability to try to interpret those from *their perspective*. It was different from how most people rationalized their endeavors and almost exclusively when they involved other people. But in the end, Phil filled his purpose as the janitor, the housekeeper and fixer of things and for the time being, an accomplice during breakfast and as Kuro finished his toast, fiddling a bit with his milk glass and glancing over at the newspaper that filled up most of the space on the small kitchen table, the spindly man stretched a bit and folded it up, putting it aside. The break was over and it was time, for both of them, to zip back into reality.

‚Äò‚ÄôYou did remember to finish that assignment last night, right?‚Äô he said. The deepness of his voice making the empty milk glass vibrate under the touch of Kuro‚Äôs fingers.

‚Äò‚ÄôMost of it. Do you want to read it?‚Äô‚Äô, Kuro said, looking up at the man as he was putting on his shoes. Phil wasn‚Äôt the, well, academic kind of person but at the same time, was an incredible critic and for some reason, was somewhat accustomed to reading school papers. Yee, wonder why, right?

‚Äò‚ÄôNot now, I gotta get to work. We have a big delivery coming in. Apparently, they decided that the west wing needed new furniture. The truck will be here in thirty minutes‚Äô‚Äô.

Kuro watched as the old man got ready to leave and Phil waved at him with his usual, quirky smile before leaving, the front door slowly ending. Kuro sighed and began cleaning up after breakfast.

**Chapter 2 ‚Äì Eft loves waking up early.**

It had been a couple of weeks since Eft and the other fairies had woken up from their hibernation and it was early spring up in the sky where she lived. It was morning and Eft could tell from the rays of sunlight shining down from the big window that dominated one of the walls in the small shed where she lived currently. Obviously it wasn‚Äôt the place where she had hibernated, alongside the other fairies but it has Eft a place of her own. Some distance from the commotion that so often tended to overwhelm her. Disturb her pattern of thought that she cherished so dearly. It wasn‚Äôt an act of sass to distance herself from the others but merely a method of maintaining a healthy relationship towards her and the common fairy. It wasn‚Äôt like she was *better* than any of them but in a way she *needed her mess* in order to think. And considering how the *others* looked on so-called ‚Äòuntidiness‚Äô‚Äô as they tended to call it Eft might have thought that separation would have been a beneficial and mutual deal to make sure that the circumstances would be optimal for both parties.

But who was Eft exactly? Like most others she was a fairy, which meant she was around a meter tall in total but she didn‚Äôt have any wings, despite being a fairy. Matter of fact, none of them had and it would have been easy to mistake a fairy for a human was it not for their size, their pointy ears, their pale-esque skin and their source of flight: The levitation stone. It was a tiny thing, the levitation stone, a small blue gem that was attached to a sturdy leather brace that Eft, like all of the other fairies, carried on her forearm. This proved to be quite an efficient little device that made traversing around the sky island, where the fairies lived trivial, but not necessarily easy.

Eft yawned, her eyes still feeling heavy with sleep as she heaved herself into a slouchy sitting position in the middle of the bed. It was still *really* early in the morning and the first of the rays of light had yet to shine down on the, now, rather moody shapes of the surrounding islands. The air was misty and a certain chill still remained in the air as the influence of the winter still tried to hang on with a thread. It was perfect really for Eft‚Äôs plan and she quickly got dressed with her regular robes and covering her with a cloak as to protect her from the outside cold. Then she strapped on her brace, the tiny blue jewel sparkling encouragingly at her as if was urging her on

‚Äò‚ÄôGo Eft, you can do it!‚Äô‚Äô, the stone whispered, showing its excitement with bright pulses of blue light.

‚Äò‚ÄôOf course I can‚Äô‚Äô, Eft hummed inside of her mind. The stones didn‚Äôt exactly *talk* per say. They more or less just, well, hummed. It was like a subtle musical sound that, for some reason, Eft just understood. Like all other fairies she had been paired with her own levitation stone and boy had it been a *journey*! Notoriously, levitation was known to be nonchalant and even rebel during the process of bonding to a new owner but this stone, *this stone* had been something else.

‚Äò‚ÄôThe levitation stone mimics the character traits of its owner‚Äô‚Äô Eft‚Äôs grandmother had said in her unbearable preacher‚Äôs voice. Personally Eft thought that it sounded like a pile of rubbish but she could admit to being a bit stubborn at times, but just maybe. Maybe the old woman was just projecting her own ideals, *she* being the stubborn one and Eft, being subjugated of her expectations of how a fairy should be and act. Regardless how it really was it made no difference to Eft because despite everything, she had a purpose to get up before dawn. The endless struggle to satisfy her curiosity like scratching an itch just out of reach. Obviously, the answer to her questions resided from right under her feet. Like *way* down to a place called the *surface*. A world that was supposedly described as a lot vaster and more diverse then the tiny snow globe-esque environment amongst the sky islands where Eft and the other fairies lived. A place where you could go in any direction for as long as you heard desired to. Like, imagine that, right?

Eft landed on the roof on one of the larger buildings in order to get her bearings. How could this be so confusing for someone that essentially could fly? Eft wasn‚Äôt sure how the others made their way around without getting themselves lost but believe it or not she had taken precautions and had in the past raised a small pole with a big, red flat as a beacon in case she was got lost on her way back. Other than that, and especially in the darkness, everything kind of looked the same. The same kind of sun-stained walls with torches and lanterns marking the locations of entrances and pathways. A sea of tiny specs of light that all shared the same message. *This is the right way, go this way!*

Right, as if it was *that* easy. Essentially, what Eft was looking for was the archives. A place that both served as a makeshift library, a museum for old artifacts and an archive for various old scrolls and tomes that were too delicate to fit in with the rest of the books. On the top floor of the building both of the main publishing and printing compartments held their operations in both reprinting old books into new editions and publishing the weekly magazine filled with all kinds of news and gossip about fairy-kind. The community wasn‚Äôt or in fact, from Eft‚Äôs perspective, didn‚Äôt feel *that* big and it was estimated that the total fairy population of this set of islands were around a couple of thousand. There *were* other colonies as well, of course that were living with their own sorts of customs and traditions all across the world and sometimes a courier or sorts would show up, sharing news and anecdotes of what was going on across the world. The problem was, which bothered Eft to no end, that none of the other colonies ever had gone down to the surface. In fact, the word and the assumption that there was a different world down there was unheard of amongst the common folk. For some reason, everyone was just happy with the way things were. Their tiny world, something they could feel with their hands and mold, form their expectations upon and more then anything, feel safe about. It wasn‚Äôt about persevering though some kind of act of self-preservation. But to look outside what already was. That was unheard of. According to the majority, there was fairy-kind and that was it.

Eft did a hop off the small building and got into a dive to pick up speed. She felt the cold morning air against her face as she slowly got in tune with her stone, closing her eyes Eft felt her trajectory switch as she broke her dive and curved back up towards the sky. It would have been so easy to, you know, just let go. Let gravity take its course and lead her in the most natural direction ‚Äì downwards. The direction that led her to all of her answers and satisfied all of her curious cravings to be able to know *more*. But she didn‚Äôt dare to, like, what if she was wrong? What if it was just a great emptiness down there where her connection to the stone became irrelevant. Some would probably have said, if you‚Äôre so curious what‚Äôs under your feel, just take the plunge. Put some stakes on the like and choose your own direction in order to get what you want and feel as satisfactory for your life and what makes it meaningful for you.

Eft just wished that didn‚Äôt have to mean jumping out of the sky. She took one good look downwards, as she was hoping to get a glance at something, anything at all to confirm her suspicions. But alas, it was to no use as the carpet of fluffy, white clouds sealed off any of the questions that lingered in her heart so she finally broke her dive, swung back up, feeling as the humming of her levitation stone intensified as they started to ascent.

The truth never came easy, did it?

**Fran**

Fran had never heard *Longview* swear before. It was like hearing a parent swear; utterly shocking. 

‚ÄúIs this Gord person going to be‚Ä¶ a problem?‚Äù Fran asked.

‚ÄúI hope not.‚Äù *Longview* said. ‚ÄúWith me in command he might leave us alone, but he has a history of sticking his head where it doesn‚Äôt belong.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù N‚Äôren said. ‚ÄúYou do not seem to like him.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt. He‚Äôs one of - if not *the* \- oldest of us. He was around before going to space was a regular thing for us. He has‚Ä¶ certain ideas about humanity and AI‚Äôs roles with humanity.‚Äù

‚ÄúBad ideas?‚Äù Fran said.

‚Äú*Old* ideas. He can also be a smug, sanctimonious so and so.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are the other ships then?‚Äù Fran was watching from her station and sure enough, there were three ships helpfully highlighted for her.

‚Äú*City of Lethbridge* is flying Luna and the Geostationary Confederation colors. They‚Äôre representing the polity of the moon and all the objects in Geostationary orbit around Earth.‚Äù *Longview* said. ‚ÄúOur boss, effectively. *Timewinder* is-God dammit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat now?‚Äù 

‚Äú*Timewinder* is flying Venusian colors.‚Äù

Fran knew a little bit about Imperial Venus. When she was on Earth a few classmates of hers came from the Floating Cities. 

Venus‚Äô atmosphere was much too thick and heavy to live on the surface, but around 30km up the temperatures, pressures, and light levels are almost Earth like. The atmosphere is still wildly acidic, but the Venusians built titanic floating cities and run their empire from there. They claim sovereignty over the Mercury Array and Ceres, but they can‚Äôt really back up the claim to Ceres. The Outer Planet Alliance claims Ceres, and the poor residents of the built up asteroid are left in the middle.

Fran knew that pointing out the politics was a quick way to get into a fight with her classmates, and she might have used it once or twice when another clique of students was giving her a hard time. One time Kip Raaden was so mad that he nearly passed out. Fran smiled internally at the memory. Everything she knew abut Venus pointed them to being vehemently anti-AI. ‚ÄúI thought Venus was anti-AI?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey are.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is *Timewinder* with them then?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúGood question. Comms, please reach out to all three parties and inquire as to the nature of their visit.‚Äù

A few moments later, the Comms officer spoke up. ‚Äú*Lethbridge* is asking if we require assistance as we linked into the emergency link coordinates. *Timewinder* wants to know what - if anything - we have found and is demanding knowledge transfer. *Medicine Hat* is requesting permission to come aboard so Gord can ‚Äòmeet our new visitors.‚Äô‚Äù

*How does he know?* Aloud Fran said, ‚Äú*Longview*, what does Gord know?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, honestly. I was asked to link a beacon back right after we scooped up our guests. It was mostly system mail, but I did include a report stating that we ‚Äúmay have found something.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust something?‚Äù 

‚ÄúCaptain Erlatan wanted us to hedge, in case it didn‚Äôt turn out to be a good something.‚Äù

Fran realized with a start that *Longview* very likely meant that if the K‚Äôlaxi, or the Xenni, or the Gate had been malicious that *Longview* would have been sacrificed to keep the secret.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just‚Ä¶ deny Medicine Hat boarding?‚Äù

‚ÄúI *could*, yes. But that would be almost worse. He‚Äôd know something was up then.‚Äù *Longview* tisked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to approve his docking. As soon as the cargo doors open, it‚Äôs going to give the whole thing away.‚Äù They paused a moment, and Fran felt the ship roll. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm putting the cargo door opposite *Timewinder* and *Lethbridge*. They‚Äôll know something‚Äôs up, but they at least won‚Äôt see *Menium* and *Inevitability of Victory*. Go on with our guests and say hi when he comes out. No sense in delaying things. I‚Äôll report to *Lethbridge* and stall *Timewinder*.‚Äù

Fran, Xar, and N‚Äôren stood at the airlock, watching the ship be pulled in. It was small; a bit smaller than *Menium* even, and was a brilliant vermilion red. Fran had never seen a ship painted with such a bright color before. The hangar was refilled with air, and as Fran popped the airlock doors, she saw someone exit *Medicine Hat*.

He was male shaped, looking like he was approaching middle aged. Not very tall, he had sandy blond hair that was cut close, and he wore dungarees and a flannel shirt. Fran had never seen an outfit like that outside of a living history museum, it was odd to see. When he noticed Fran, Xar, and N‚Äôren his eyes widened a moment, but then he broke into a wide, genuine looking smile, and waved.

‚ÄúHey there! Turns out you did find someone at that structure after all, eh? Here I was, all ready to give you a hard time because you got so messed up that you had to run an emergency link, and I see you come calling with a guest!‚Äù He looked at them ‚ÄúOr rather, *two* someones! My name‚Äôs Gord, pleased to meetcha.‚Äù

*He was so casual.* Fran was taken aback. ‚ÄúUh Hello. I‚Äôm Francine Sharma, but everyone calls me Fran. This is N‚Äôren Kitani - she‚Äôs K‚Äôlaxi - and Consortium Leader Xar - He‚Äôs Xenni. Both of their ships were damaged traversing a Gate, so we brought them aboard to help with repairs.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs awfully neighborly of you.‚Äù Gord said, ‚ÄúBut... why did you bring them back to Sol with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can talk more about this inside, Gord.‚Äù *Longview* said. ‚ÄúDo come in please.‚Äù

‚Äú*Longview*! You old degan! haven‚Äôt heard from you in forever. You still sore about that thing out past Eris?‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ Fran, will you take Gord over to Conference room 4? I‚Äôll get some refreshments sent up.‚Äù

He walked past Fran and winked. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still sore.‚Äù 

Gord had coffee, Xar had water, and Francine and N‚Äôren drank tea as Gord was brought up to speed with what was going on and with who. After the explanation, he whistled low. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt experience link-death, but even I know that sharing it is unheard of. That‚Äôs wild.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt exper-‚Äù N‚Äôren said and stopped. Her fur puffed once and went back down. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an AI, right. I apologize, I forgot you were not human.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. Not me,‚Äù Gord‚Äôs smile was lightning quick. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt hold it against you for thinking it. We‚Äôre not all big cranky old Starjumpers.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am *not* cranky.‚Äù *Longview* said.

‚ÄúA sure sign of someone being cranky is them trying to convince everyone they‚Äôre not.‚Äù

‚Äú*Gord*!‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay okay,‚Äù Gord raised his hands in surrender. ‚ÄúIt sounds like you three are in it a bit. The K‚Äôlaxi and Xenni in a war, but neither of you are sure how it started? That‚Äôs a pickle alright.‚Äù His head coked very slightly to the side, as if he had heard something, and he stood. ‚ÄúFar be it from me to keep you from your business though. We just wanted to see how you were getting on, and it seems like you three are getting along like house on fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúEr-‚Äù Xar rumbled.

‚ÄúHis idioms are difficult even for me.‚Äù *Longview* said.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù

Gord laughed. As he walked towards the door he stopped and looked Fran. ‚ÄúYour Granddad would be proud of you, Fran. I know it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know my Grandpa?‚Äù Fran said. 

‚ÄúGeneralissimo Vic? Sure do. He and I go way back. I knew him when he was just Captain Vic, on his first command. I used to do one of the Sol/New Wellington runs back‚Ä¶ before.‚Äù Gord looked distant for a moment. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs good people. You‚Äôre carrying his name well.‚Äù

‚ÄúT-thanks, Gord.‚Äù Fran didn‚Äôt know what else to say.

And that was that. Gord came in, bewildered everyone, and left. He wasn‚Äôt even aboard two hours. 

*Longview* said that the other two Starjumpers were mostly just checking in after they detected someone linking to the emergency coordinates. They offered printable mass and received a report on the piracy around Me√≠hu√†. Neither seemed surprised about it. *Longview* explained Contact and the war - basically the same story they told Gord - but made it clear they were not staying.

‚ÄúWhat about *Timewinder*?‚Äù Fran asked.

‚ÄúWe - reluctantly - explained Contact to them as well and sent along the same information we sent Lethbridge, minus a few details, like where we were and the whole Gate thing. Oh and Fran, Captain Kip Raaden sends his regards.""

""Wha?"" Fran blushed and tried to maintain a neutral expression. Kip was handsome sure, but he was always pestering her back in school.

‚ÄúWhy redact details in your report to the other ship?‚Äù Xar said.

‚ÄúIf Venus finds out that there are Gates that work like wormhole generators all over the galaxy and that there are at least two sapient groups who use them they‚Äôll leave faster than you can say ‚Äúno wait‚Äù and go messing about.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm. I will defer to your expertise about the humans.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it Xar, I live here and I leave the politics to the humans most of the time.‚Äù *Longview* said, ‚ÄúIn fact I-‚Äù He paused a moment. ‚ÄúThat **mother fucker.**‚Äù

‚ÄúWho? What? What did someone do to someone‚Äôs mother?‚Äù N‚Äôren said.

‚Äú*Gord*. I thought his visit was too casual and off the cuff. While we were talking, his partner in crime, *Medicine Hat* snuck into our systems and duped all our data on the Xenni and K‚Äôlaxi.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that bad?‚Äù Fran asked.

‚Äú*Kind of bad*, yes Fran. It'll depend on what he does with the data.‚Äù *Longview* said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not great, that‚Äôs for sure. Luna sponsored us and they declared right of first refusal with anything we found. Now, that got all boxed up with Gord pinching a copy.‚Äù *Longview* sighed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just have to carry on and complete our task and not invite any **more** ancient AIs onboard for coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are other-‚Äù Xar said, utterly bewildered.

‚Äú*Idom*.‚Äù Longview said.

Captain Erlatan was asked if she wanted to transfer to *Lethbridge* and be relieved. Her healing was progressing much more slowly than anticipated, so she agreed, and *Longview* was placed formally in command of the mission. Xar and N‚Äôren expressed surprise, but Fran and *Longview* explained it wasn‚Äôt completely unheard of. 

‚ÄúYour ships can be in command of their mission?‚Äù Xar said.

‚ÄúIt makes sense if you think about it.‚Äù Fran said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs their own body, they have a vested interest in things going well.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose‚Ä¶‚Äù Xar trailed off.

The repairs were going to take a few days, and the K‚Äôlaxi and Xenni both were invited to watch the process. They couldn‚Äôt see details on the human parts and the printing hall was off limits, but they got to watch the repair teams work. Xar was especially interested in how the different teams aboard the ship worked together on repairs, and asked if it was all right for a few Xenni to come aboard and observe. *Longview* couldn‚Äôt think of a reason to not permit it, so three Xenni joined Xar and watched the work, fascinated. 

‚ÄúSo you work with the technicians who run the matter printers to help‚Ä¶ tune the parts?‚Äù One of them said, talking to the repair crew lead.

‚ÄúYeah, the parts are the parts, but we have a bit of room in the spec to adjust things up or down as the situation warrants.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why? The specification is the specification.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, *but* the specification is a range for a reason. If we‚Äôre going out on a long term deployment, we want parts to be as reliable as possible. That means being conservative with our settings so things are under less stress and last longer. If we‚Äôre jumping into something hot and heavy, we‚Äôll run the parts with a bit more heat, knowing the failure rate will be higher. It‚Äôs like running WEP. We know it reduces the life of the reactor, but if it means we live to see another day, then we‚Äôll just schedule extra maintenance.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù 

Fran noticed the younger Xenni attempt to rumble like Xar does, but it didn‚Äôt quite have the same‚Ä¶ gravitas as his. 

‚ÄúSince you have the matter printers-‚Äù Another Xenni said, this one the smallest of the three, but had the most elaborate shell, ‚Äú-you have no need for spare parts, correct?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh no! We keep spares on hand, always.‚Äù The human said. ‚ÄúThree is two, two is one, one is none after all.‚Äù

The Xenni made an odd gesture with both claws, *Longview* explained that was a questioning gesture.

‚ÄúIf you have three parts, you only have two.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you have three.‚Äù The Xenni said.

‚ÄúYes, but one is *in use*. When it fails then you have two, and then two is one.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if you can print any parts you need, why keep the spares?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happens when the printers fail? What happens if a lucky shot takes out the printer hall? What if we‚Äôre stranded in the middle of interstellar space with no printable matter and a broken reactor? Always have a backup plan, and if you can, have a backup to the backup.‚Äù

‚ÄúPardon me,‚Äù *Longview* said. ‚Äú*Menium* and I have completed the translation of the K‚Äôlaxi navigation coordinate system, and I have mapped it to ours successfully. I can link us to Gatehouse/Lamentation. As soon as the repairs have been completed, we can leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you for the update, *Longview*.‚Äù Fran said cheerfully.

‚ÄúYes, er, so please escort our Xenni guests back to their ship so that the repair teams can work without interruption.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh! Of course. Should Xar and N‚Äôren-‚Äù Fran trailed off.

‚ÄúNo, they can stay. You three should probably stick together for now.‚Äù

‚Äú*Longview*?‚Äù N‚Äôren said. ‚ÄúWhat happened past‚Ä¶ Eris?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it.‚Äù *Longview* said with finality.

I've been trawling this reddit for recommendations for a bottle/travel mug to carry everyday and couldn't really find what I was looking for so thought I'd just ask.

I'm looking to buy a waterbottle/travel mug that I can carry to work (I commute by either bike or bus dependeing on the weather). Ideally I'd like it to be a waterbottle with some insulation that I can occasionally use for tea/coffee if I'm travelling by bus. I'd prefer something made of metal and that is easy to clean.

  
The '[Hitch bottle](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/carryhitch/hitch-your-bottle-and-cup-belong-together)' looked really good, but it seems to be no longer available and I saw some poor reviews calling it scammy online.

I really like the design of the 750ml [Ocean Bottle](https://oceanbottle.co/collections/750ml?pb=0) the double openeing makes it really good for cleaning and for drinking beverages, and the build quality is great, but I think 40 quid is quite pricey for a waterbottle.

I am now thinking of getting [this](https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/mp/primus/slurken-travel-mug/_/R-p-0980ebca-64af-410c-9dfa-8f27980284a2?mc=fc9bf129-d610-4a0a-9ad0-c63742f52392&c=silver) travel mug from Primus since it's on sale, even though it's a bit smaller than I would've liked.

 I've already started sanding the top, my next plan is to take it apart to sand the legs and bottom. Im looking for advice on restaining it.



 I have oil based prestain, oil stain, & poly. Is that good? Do I need to set sand it? Also does the dark spots look ok? Im thinking of the color english walnut and its a darker stain so im assuming a few dark spots is ok? Also curious what the dark spots are from, they're pockets and not raised.

Whether you're planning a trip or just dreaming of the perfect getaway, here are some must-visit places.  

1. Uluwatu and the Cliffside Temple

Pura Luhur Uluwatu is one of Bali‚Äôs most stunning temples. Perched on a 70-meter-high cliff, it offers incredible ocean views and sunsets. If you‚Äôre lucky, you might catch a traditional Kecak fire dance performance at sunset!  

2. Tegallalang Rice Terraces

These iconic emerald-green rice fields are a Bali postcard come to life. The cascading terraces make for perfect photos, and nearby cafes offer *luwak* coffee tastings with jungle views.  

3. Tibumana Waterfall

Hidden in the lush jungle near Ubud, this waterfall looks like something out of a movie. Less crowded than Tegenungan or Sekumpul, it‚Äôs ideal for a peaceful swim in the cool waters.  

4. Besakih Temple (The Mother Temple of Bali)

Pura Besakih, Bali‚Äôs largest and holiest temple complex, sits on the slopes of Mount Agung. With dozens of shrines, it‚Äôs still an active site for important ceremonies.  

5. Padang Padang Beach

This small but stunning beach gained fame from Eat, Pray, Love. Its white sand, turquoise water, and dramatic cliffs create a secluded paradise vibe.  

6. Mount Batur and Lake

For adventure seekers, a sunrise hike up Mount Batur is a must. The panoramic views of the lake and surrounding mountains are worth the early wake-up call! Afterward, relax in the Toya Devasha hot springs.  

7. Sacred Monkey Forest, Ubud

The Sacred Monkey Forest is home to hundreds of long-tailed macaques. Wander among ancient trees and temples‚Äîbut watch your belongings, as the monkeys can be mischievous!  

8. Nusa Penida & Nusa Lembongan

To escape the crowds, head to Nusa Penida or Nusa Lembongan. You‚Äôll find jaw-dropping spots like Kelingking Beach and Atuh Beach, plus amazing snorkeling with manta rays.  

Bali has something for everyone‚Äîspiritual retreats, adrenaline-pumping activities, beach relaxation, or culinary adventures. The key is to explore beyond the tourist hotspots!

1ky9j6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1ky9j6x/pug_with_food_obsession/,Pug with food obsession,"I had him since 8 weeks old and he's now 9. It's been making me really unhappy the past few years and affecting my mental health. Things all seem to have started when I temporarily stayed at a friend's house. Before that, I could even eat a chicken dinner next to him and he'd just ignore it and sleep. He had always been trained that food in his bowl is his and food on a plate or anywhere else is mine unless I offer him a treat or something. 

At this friend's house they have a dog too. What used to happen is when my friend sometimes fed the dogs, my pug would finish his food but the friend's dog was slow at eating and would often eat half and then leave the rest for later. My pug would see that left food in a bowl and go over to eat it thinking it's his. If my friend saw, they would run up to my dog and pull him away from it. He'd be growling and trying to pull forward to gobble as much as he could. 

I did tell the friend they shouldn't do this but it often fell on deaf ears. 

Ever since I moved from there, my dog was never the same, he's just so obsessed with food. He tries stealing off my plate, wont let me go to the kitchen without being under my feet expecting something. If he's fast asleep on the sofa and I've just come down from my office upstairs after working, he will wake up and be jumping all over me, sniffing my hands and pockets for any treats. I can't really take him to pubs or coffee shops anymore because he repeatedly jumps at my legs, ruining the experience for me in the hunt for food. Even when I tell him no and stop, he can't control himself. 

I dread walks because I can't enjoy them anymore as I've got to be on the lookout for things people have dropped that he might try to sneak eat (like chewing gum). 

Even when it's his food time, when I let him out to go to the toilet, he will often hold it in thinking he will get back in quicker, and if he was particularly bursting, he will just poo on the floor half way through eating. If he does go, it will be as close to the back door as possible to get in quicker. 

I can't sleep with him in my bed anymore because he wakes up in the night trampling over me sniffing for food. 

If he's sniffing over me to see if I have anything, trampling on me and it's hurting me, I do a firm ""NO!"" or ""STOP!"". I can tell he knows I want him to stop, but he's not satisfied until he's fully searched me. So he will go over to the other side of the sofa, lay down in the sleeping position but have his eyes firmly on me. Then I can't settle because anything I do such as moving my leg or coughing ends up being a sign for him that it's fine to try again. 

So yeah. It's a nightmare and I don't even know what to do to get him back to how he was.

This behaviour is just so bad all the time, it's sad to say the only time I like my dog these days is when he's asleep and because he generally looks cute. Everything else we did together is ruined by this complete food obsession. ",1,1748521736.0,DogAdvice,0,1.0,False
1ky9ixe,https://www.reddit.com/r/SabbaticalPlanning/comments/1ky9ixe/planning_made_easy_the_role_of_ai/,Planning made easy: The role of A.I.,"Owing in part to my unique compulsion to save notes on our process and in part to a love of learning, I've gone all in on A.I. to add options and depth to our sabbatical. Please note that I do not work in tech, haven't coded since they showed you how to make an apple appear on those bulky monitors back in the 80s in junior high, and am making plenty of mistakes at which people who actually do this stuff for a living would probably cringe. But this post is more like a regular - if slightly nerdy - person's journey into Artificial Intelligence. It is a longer post than I usually make, ironically so given that it is partially about saving time. 

But here we go...

**Background: How we began** 

As a threshold point, we aren't interested in having a fully scripted five month sabbatical, quite the opposite. But we like a good plan, so our goal has been to have the basics covered - accommodations, travel between destinations, and a few food-related anchors - and kind of let the rest happen how it happens.

So, like many out here, we googled and YouTube'd our way to some financial guideposts, picked an amount of time that was acceptable (not quite as long as I wanted but at the outer edge of my wife's comfort zone) and got to the business of saving and dreaming. Enter A.I.

**Early Uses: Itinerary building** 

We knew early we wanted a travel sabbatical, so really the only questions were where to go and what could we afford. I made a list, and then another list, and then iterated on the list every week for months...and then stumbled onto [GuideGeek.ai](http://GuideGeek.ai) on Whatsapp.

It was my first exposure to a practically useful way to leverage this new (to us) technology. I didn't know anything about good prompts or how it was supposed to work, but the first time I put in ""we are going to be in Switzerland for ten days around Zurich and Grindelwald, we love good food, hikes, and at least some culture but not too much, build us a seven day itinerary"" I was floored by the results! So rich and varied but also oddly tailored to our style. It was creepy but kind of cool. So then I started using that for awhile, mostly to shape the ""where"" question, not for the itineraries per se.

**Evolution: Building scripts and scraping the web** 

Somehow, about three months ago I went from using A.I. to consume large amounts of PDF material for work and help analyze various approaches to problems to learning how you can completely change what it means to Google something.

The short version is that ChatGPT, which I have found more useful so far than Google Gemini, offered to write me a program that I could use to create a set of basic rules or ideas and then have the computer scour the Internet, gather all the things that met my rules, organize them into a tidy list and then give me a dummy-proof interface for keeping track of it all and grabbing what I want.

As an example, instead of using Google to search for nice restaurants in Provence, I used ChatGPT and this custom script that told my computer what to get me to search for a certain number of restaurants meeting a certain set of criteria across more than a dozen cities or regions all at once.

And it freakin worked!!!

Will we go to all of them? Of course not. But now instead of fumbling around or guessing we have some pre-screened options and basic knowledge about when they are open, how much they cost, if other people like them, etc. So technically we can still fumble around if we want to but we know there is a backup plan. I've done this now with hikes, major attractions, unique finds, markets and so on. It has been incredible and kind of a fun way to pre-explore and daydream.

**Around the Corner: Memories and Such** 

I've been using ChatGPT to help me explore ways to capture memories we make as we make them. But doing so in a way that is less intrusive than interrupting the enjoyment of the moment to capture the moment with a photo or journal entry or something. This has been my introduction to A.I. agents.

I get that it may seem like a spurious use case, but I was recently looking at a coffee table book we - by which I mean almost entirely my wife - spent hours putting together. We loved reliving the memories of that vacation and I think we could have more rich memories with less work. So I'm scouring corners of the Internet with Sam Altman's help (not literally of course) to transform another aspect of this planning, which is how to be as effective as possible at capturing my memories while still being in the moment and not obsessed with my phone or posing for a photo too much. I also think audio and video add a richness that still photos can't, so that's part of the exploration.

I love the learning. Plus it has spawned a few business ideas and endless daydreaming. If you've read this far and have your own stories of A.I. usage to share please do. I'm always on the hunt to learn new tweaks to enjoying this exploration. Cheers.",0,1748521714.0,SabbaticalPlanning,0,0.5,False

1ky9c06,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1ky9c06/i_made_a_tool_to_delete_junk_mail_from_gmail_in/,I made a tool to delete junk mail from Gmail in bulk,"Sharing a project I've been working on called [Junk Mail Cleaner](https://junkmailcleaner.com).

It's a micro saas utility to clean out junk mail from your Gmail inbox in bulk. No subscription required to use. 

I built this to solve a problem I have. I hate how bogged down my Gmail inbox gets with useless mail over the course of the year. 

It works in three simple steps:

1. Scan your inbox (pick the scan time frame, email categories, etc.)
2. Review your scan results.
3. Delete emails.

This isn't a new concept. Tools like Superhuman exist but most people can't afford $30/month for email. And there are other options but they're all subscription based which annoys me.

And it's low risk to try:

* **Scan for FREE.**¬†Seriously, see what it finds, no strings.
* **Only pay if you like the results**¬†and want to actually delete the junk. It's a small one-time fee, about the price of a NYC coffee.
* If you think the scan sucks (spoiler: it doesn't üòâ), you pay nada.

It's a pretty simple tool, but it scratches¬†my¬†itch of wanting a clean inbox without the subscription headache.",2,1748521111.0,microsaas,6,1.0,False

She would be sad that I let binge eating take over, that I neglected my health whenever my moods dipped. The joys of ADHD and anxiety.

She would be sad that I feel like a failure at work, struggling through adulthood. She was always a high achiever with only As and Bs, and now I'm an insecure woman too scared to apply for director roles.

She would be sad that I still haven‚Äôt met someone. Instead, I‚Äôm collecting bridesmaid titles‚Äîthird time now, with three more pending. How do I explain to her that she's never experienced love before? That she's never really known what it's like to be with someone who respects, appreciates and loves her? Someone who she can truly trust.

But most of all, she‚Äôd be sad that I‚Äôm sad. She was sad a lot too, but she believes that growing up would fix it. Instead, I‚Äôve ended up sadder than ever.

I‚Äôd probably leave her waiting, hot chocolate in hand, crying as she realises I stood her up‚Äîtoo ashamed to show her how things turned out. She peaked too early and never learned how to handle anxiety. The lack of friends in college and the years of bullying left a deeper mark than we both knew.

However I wake up exhausted. Also I notice the feeling of anxiety in the morning before I take my pill. Is it just wearing off at night and I am feeling the withdrawal by morning? 

I have never had a problem getting to sleep at night, but wake up around 5am and then I'm in and out until I get up. 
I started drinking coffee again, usually around mid morning or early afternoon and it still makes me sleepy, I usually take a nap around an hour later. 

Anyone have any experience with this? If I increase my dosage and take another pill in the evening will I see improvement? Thoughts?
