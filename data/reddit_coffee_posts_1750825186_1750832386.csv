# The Software Dilemma: Quick Fix or Custom Fit?

Choosing the right software for your business is like buying clothes — do you go for something ready-made off the rack (that fits *almost*) or invest in a perfectly tailored suit? This is precisely what businesses face today when deciding between **low-code platforms** and **custom software solutions**. Each has its strengths and quirks, but the best choice depends on your business goals, budget, timeline, and long-term vision.

If you’ve ever scratched your head wondering, “Do I need custom software for my business?” or “Can I just use a low-code app and be done with it?” this blog is your go-to guide. So, grab a cup of coffee, and let’s explore what suits your business best — with simple words and no tech jargon overload!

# Getting to Know the Players: What is Low-Code and What is Custom Software?

Before we compare them, let’s understand what each term means.

**Low-Code Development**:

Think of low-code platforms as drag-and-drop software builders. They let you create apps with minimal coding — perfect for people who are not tech experts. Platforms like **OutSystems**, **Zoho Creator**, or **Microsoft PowerApps** fall in this category. They’re fast, flexible (to a point), and great for prototyping or solving minor business problems quickly.

**Custom Software Development**:

This is where the magic happens. **Custom software services** involve building applications from scratch explicitly tailored to your business needs. Whether you want a custom CRM, a unique inventory system, or a personalized employee dashboard, custom software delivers precisely what you envision.

# Round 1: Speed vs. Control

**Low-Code: Fast and Furious**

Need a quick solution? Low-code platforms can help you launch apps in days or weeks — no long meetings with developers. There are no massive budgets. You can test ideas fast and fix them on the go.

**Custom Software: Full Control at Your Fingertips**

While it takes more time to develop, custom software offers complete control over the end product. You decide how it works, how it looks, and how it grows. Yes, it takes more time upfront, but in return, you get a robust system that fits your business like a glove.

**Winner?** If you need something fast and straightforward, consider a low-code approach. But if you’re thinking long-term, custom software is worth the wait.

# Round 2: Flexibility vs. Limitations

**Low-Code: Easy but Limited**

Most low-code tools come with predefined templates and limited customization options. You can create simple forms, workflows, and dashboards — but the moment you need a unique feature, things get tricky or impossible.

**Custom Software: Built for Your Needs**

Here’s where **custom software services** shine. From complex integrations to user-specific roles, automation, and AI — if you can imagine it, developers can build it. Platform rules do not box you in.

**Winner?** Custom software all the way if flexibility matters to you.

# Round 3: Cost — Budget-Friendly vs. Smart Investment

**Low-Code: Affordable at First**

One of the biggest attractions of low-code tools is the low upfront cost. They typically operate on subscription models — paying monthly or yearly. It’s great if you have a tight budget.

**Custom Software: Pay More, But Reap More**

Yes, custom software costs more initially. But here’s the thing — it’s a **one-time investment** with long-term gains. There are no recurring license fees. There are no hidden charges. Plus, you own the software and data completely.

**Winner?** Low-code for short-term savings; custom software for long-term value.

# Round 4: Scalability — Growing with Your Business

**Low-Code: Good for Small Projects**

Low-code apps are best suited for small to medium-sized workflows. But as your business scales, they may start to feel cramped. More users, more data, and more complex needs might slow things down.

**Custom Software: Built to Grow**

When you invest in [**custom software development**](https://dynfolics.com/software-development/), your system grows as your business does. Need new features? Add them. Expanding to new markets? Customize workflows. No limits.

**Winner?** Custom software if you’re aiming for growth and expansion.

# Round 5: Support & Security

**Low-Code: Vendor Controlled**

The vendor handles security and updates in low-code platforms. Sounds good — but also risky. If the platform shuts down or changes pricing, you’re stuck.

**Custom Software: In Your Hands**

With custom software, **security**, and **support** are in your control. Select your hosting, implement your security protocols, and receive dedicated support from your development team.

**Winner?** Custom software wins again when data safety and control are a priority.

# Real-World Scenarios: When to Choose What?

**Choose Low-Code If:**

* You need to launch fast (within days/weeks)
* You have a tight budget
* Your app requirements are basic (forms, workflows, dashboards)
* You want to test an idea before investing in a big

**Choose Custom Software If:**

* You need a unique, feature-rich system
* Your business processes are complex
* You care about full ownership of your software
* You want scalability and strong security

# Final Thoughts: What’s Right for Your Business?

It’s not about which is better — it’s about which is better **for you**. Low-code tools are like ready-to-use recipes: quick, convenient, and suitable for standard dishes. Custom software, however, is like hiring a chef to cook your dream meal from scratch. It’s personal, powerful, and precise.

If your business is starting or experimenting with ideas, low-code is a great stepping stone. But if you’re ready to level up, streamline your operations, and build a brand that lasts — [**custom software development**](https://dynfolics.com/software-development/) is your best bet.

1ljy4es,https://i.redd.it/y2toj3nil09f1.png,A Reflection on Before the Coffee Gets Cold,"To be completely honest, I walked into this book blind. I had no expectations, no clue what kind of narrative it held, and for the longest time, I didn’t even have the slightest interest in it. I would often see it on the shelves of Fully Booked, glance at its title, and keep walking. It never called out to me—until one quiet moment, it finally did.

I didn’t expect that such a small book, with such a quiet presence, would hold answers to the very questions I’ve carried with me for years—about life, time, love, regrets, and what it means to be truly present with ourselves and others. When I first opened it, my initial thought was: *“This sounds like something one of my clients would tell me.”* But as I continued reading, something shifted. I realized I wasn’t just seeing other people’s stories anymore—I was seeing my own. The deeper I went, the more the book became a mirror, reflecting things I’ve felt but never fully admitted to myself.

This book doesn’t scream its wisdom at you. It whispers. And in that quiet, it somehow speaks volumes. It reminded me that life is meant to be cherished—not just in the grand, picture-perfect moments, but in the quiet, ordinary ones too.

Reading it wasn’t easy for me. I’m not the type who usually gravitates toward emotionally heavy stories. I prefer books that are raw and brutal, with sharp plot twists and narratives that leave you questioning your morals. I like stories that are controversial, unsettling—books that spark argument, not sentiment. But *Before the Coffee Gets Cold* disarmed me.

It tells a simple story. But in its simplicity lies its weight. It doesn’t just show what happens to people—it shows what people *feel* in those moments. It’s not just about events, it’s about emotional truth.



**HOPE**

The first answer the book gave me was *hope*.

But not the kind of hope that promises rainbows after a storm. Not the kind of hope that feeds you sugarcoated lies that “everything happens for a reason” or “things will eventually fall into place.”

No. This was a quieter, harder kind of hope.

It’s the kind of hope that keeps you moving forward even when nothing is changing. The kind that tells you: *do it anyway*. Even if the outcome is unclear. Even if nothing shifts. Even if the future holds the same silence you're sitting with now.

That was hard to accept. I’ve always struggled with the idea of being powerless in the present. Most of us cling to the belief that if we work hard enough, or want something deeply enough, the universe will reward us. That cause and effect will eventually play in our favor. But the truth is, not everything is within our control—and this book doesn’t shy away from that.

There’s a character in the story—she travels back in time hoping to receive love after three years of waiting. And even with all the chances given to her, there is still no guarantee.

That struck me.

Hope, as this book revealed, isn’t about certainty. It’s about courage.

It’s about choosing to act *even if* your desire won’t be fulfilled.

It’s about showing up, saying what you feel, doing what you must—without being attached to the outcome.

Because at the end of the day, what matters is not whether things turned out as you imagined. What matters is that you tried. That you made your move. That you showed up for life. That you lived without regrets.



**LOVE**

The second answer was *love*.

And not just the romantic kind, or the kind you see in movies. It’s the kind that lingers even when someone is gone. The kind that doesn’t ask for anything in return.

As someone who’s often felt invisible, who has grown up feeling unloved in many spaces of her life, this part hit hard.

I’ve always wondered if love was something given only to the worthy, only to those who knew how to ask for it, or present themselves “right.” But this book showed me otherwise.

Love, real love, is never half-baked.

When people love, they *give it all*. And that’s true whether their reasons are pure or messy, whether they’re in the right place emotionally or still figuring things out. Love doesn’t keep score. Love doesn’t measure what it gives. It just gives.

In one of the stories, even when the person is about to be forgotten—when all memory of them will fade—love still lingers. It’s not erased. It’s not invalidated. It just transforms.

There’s something so powerful in that.

It reminded me that love isn’t measured by permanence or recognition. Even if it ends. Even if it’s one-sided. Even if it doesn’t come back to you the way you imagined—it still matters. It still heals.

And that love, when understood this way, doesn’t hurt. The pain comes from attachment, expectations, rejection—but love itself? Love allows us to endure. Love, even in fragments, teaches us how to hold on.



**LIFE**

The third and final answer was *life*.

This one was the heaviest.

I’ve had many moments in my past where death felt like a more comforting option than waking up again. I’ve lived through pain that left me numb. I’ve gone through days that felt like I was floating outside of my own body, just watching time pass by.

So when this book began to speak of life—how fragile it is, and yet how powerful—weirdly, I felt both seen and comforted.

Because *Before the Coffee Gets Cold* doesn’t pretend that life is always beautiful. It doesn’t glamorize resilience. But it does show that in every breath, every wait, every conversation, every chance—there is meaning.

The characters don’t always get what they want. But they still choose to live, to feel, to speak, to love. And in doing so, they create their own meaning.

And that made me realize—being alive *is* the miracle.

Not what we achieve, or who we end up with. Just being here.

Every inhale is a chance.  
Every second we wait is a privilege.  
Every ""I love you"" we say—whether or not it is returned—is a moment that can’t be taken away.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s what it really means to live:  
To make peace with the uncertainty,  
To love without possession,  
To keep moving even when there are no promises—  
And to drink the coffee,  
before it gets cold.",2,1750831772.0,PHBookClub,0,1.0,False

Communication on his end has always been a problem. He doesn't tell me what's happening, if plans have been made etc and I have to scramble to get ready, change my own plans etc I have spoken to him about this before, he says he'll work on it and things improve for 2-3 days and then we're back at square one. I had surgery at the beginning of May which has left me with a cavity wound that needs dressed and packed, this means going to the GP surgery every day/every other day. I have a chronic illness and am currently in a wheelchair.

Incident: My partner told me that there was a Leaving Assembly for his mother who was retiring from her school. It starts 2 hours before my appointment that we've known about for a week in advance. He told me on Monday that his Dad had text him (2 days notice, as if they didn't know this was happening before then) asking if he could show up. (His mum was never his teacher, no other family is going, it's a school thing, not a family thing). I then reminded him, maybe not as kindly as I should have, that I have an appointment on Wednesday morning that can't be changed, it's important and why am I just finding out now? He said ""yeah, it's not ideal"" and slunk off. The way he said this implied that my already scheduled appointment for something outwith my control wasn't ideal. I did say I didn't like the way he'd say that, he apologised and said he should have clarified that he meant the Retirement Assembly wasn't ideal. Due to past incidences with this behaviour, I don't fully believe him but fine, whatever. Fast forward to last (Tuesday) night, and at nearly 11pm as I rolled over to go to sleep (bearing in mind we've been in bed together for over an hour) he says:

 ""I think I will go to my mum's thing tomorrow, I've set some alarms so I'm not late, I'll be back to take you to the drs though.""

In my half-asleep state this didn't even register until I woke up this morning and now I'm *pissed*.

He does not have a great track record with being on time or acknowledging the importance of others peoples time and commitment. The last huge fight we had about this was because I had a dentists appointment that he made me late for because he was fannying about. We were 10 minutes late, i got horrible attitude from the receptionist and made to sit by myself in a separate waiting area until the dentist could see me. Yet the next day he was on time for a day of golfing. He was on time for drinks with his pals, yet I have to beg him to get off his arse when there's something important happening elsewhere.

It's a common occurrence that he doesn't respect my time or commitments when I bend over backwards to facilitate his. We've **just** had a conversation about him not informing me of plans he makes and he promises he'll be better, then he hits me with this.

In my mind, he deliberately waited until I was half asleep to drop it on me because he knew I'd have a problem that less than 12 hours until my appointment/this assembly that he had changed plans **again**. He told me he wasn't going, he assured me he'd be able to take me to my appointment and this happens *all the time*. I'm still in bed, lying next to him snoring away, absolutely seething at the disrespect.



However, I also haven't had a coffee and a smoke this morning yet so....AIO or am I justified in being miffed because yet again he's waited til the last minute to communicate anything with me and will probably be late and I'll miss another appointment?",3,1750831675.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False
1ljy2th,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1ljy2th/sooo_is_this_a_date_or/,"""Sooo is this a date or...?""","Hi bros. I have a little crush on the owner of my favorite queer coffee shop. Everytime I go in and he's working, we ended up chatting for like 30 minutes before he's finally like ""ahhh okay I really should get back to work!"", and I always just want more time with him. A few days ago when I saw him, he asked me if I'd want to go out for drinks to celebrate when im done with school in a few weeks and I said yes. 

A few problems though. I dont know if its a date or if it is just friendly drinks. He's very social and has asked my roommate out for friendly drinks (she's also a regular at the coffee shop), so I know that's a thing that he does. We also matched on Tinder before but we only chatted for a few days and there was no flirting, just friendly conversation. However, every time we chat in person, I feel like there's something there. Like his eyes seem to light up and the other day he was super giggly and flustered while taking my order, but wasnt like that with anyone before or after me??? Idk yall. I cannot stress enough how friendly he is, so idk if Im special or if he just lights up like that with everyone lmao

I also dont know how or if I should ask if its a date or not. He's an incredible man and I genuinely dont care if we are friends or something more, I just want to be around him. Should i even ask or just go, have a good time, and feel things out from there?",0,1750831595.0,askgaybros,3,0.5,False
1ljy2iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthopedicDoctorsPune/comments/1ljy2iw/years_of_back_pain_stole_my_energy_until_one/,Years of back pain stole my energy… until one small movement changed everything.,"For years, the pain was just… there. A dull, dragging ache in the lower back that came and went—until it didn’t. It clung on longer, got sharper, and spread to the legs. Sitting at work felt like punishment. Sleeping meant tossing, turning, and waking up more tired than before. Mornings were the worst; standing straight took effort. People around called it ""just stress"" or ""bad posture."" So they pushed through. Kept working, kept pretending.

But deep down, the fear was growing louder. *What if this never goes away?*

Physiotherapy helped a little. Painkillers numbed it briefly. But nothing seemed to work for long. Weekends became recovery time. Social life shrank. They stopped going on long drives—the thing that once brought peace. Even short walks felt like a gamble. Every new recommendation became another dead end. And one day, when they bent down to tie a shoelace and felt that sharp jolt shoot up their spine, they froze, not from pain, but from panic.

“I was about to give up.”

But something inside said: try once more. A colleague had whispered about a spine specialist who “listens first, treats second.” Desperate and tired, they made the appointment.

That’s when they met **Dr. Nirmal Patil**.

It wasn’t magic. It wasn’t immediate. But it felt different. He didn’t rush. He asked questions others didn’t. He explained what was happening—clearly, calmly. For the first time, they felt like a person, not just a chart.

The treatment plan was precise. Gradual. Rooted in understanding, not guesswork. There were good days, setbacks, and slow wins. But each win felt massive—like bending without pain, walking to the store, sitting through a movie.

The moment that broke them? Standing barefoot on the balcony one morning, coffee in hand, I realized the pain wasn’t there. Not even a whisper. Just silence. Relief. A return to self.

If anyone’s going through the same, don’t ignore it. Don’t settle. Recovery doesn’t come in one big moment. Sometimes, it sneaks in quietly. And it starts by trying… just one more time.",1,1750831564.0,OrthopedicDoctorsPune,1,1.0,False

Troubles with spouse, an injury that was the result of a surgery that was supposed to improve my life but left me in chronic pain, caring for an 85yo mother which feels like a second job some days even though she's in care (and she was horribly abusive when I was a kid but I'm the only one left).  I also lost my sister, and former husband during this time, have to work long hours despite the chronic pain because my husband prioritizes possessions over all else, and well, I could go on.  

So today I wake up at 3:30am because pain usually doesn't let me sleep much.  Tried to get back to sleep til around 5:30, then decided I may as well get up and work.  Made a coffee and went to my desk downstairs.  By 10am I fugure I better move a bit as my back is seizing up.  I step outside to walk through the forest that is my property, hoping to get a moment of zen. My boss sends a text message while I'm walking asking for a meeting, and then I'm getting another message from mom asking me to buy her groceries (she is in a care home but apparently their food isn't good enough).  

I just lost my shit.  I started to shake uncontrollably from head to toe, my heart was racing and I couldn't think straight.  I could barely stand I was shaking so hard.  I just leaned against a tree and tried my best to slow down the breathing til I finally gained enough control to be able to walk back to the house.  I have never experienced anything like this before.  Is this what a panic attack feels like?  I don't know what else would trigger something like this but wow, my brain was in a fog for hours afterwards, and even on the call with the boss I was still shaking and having trouble speaking. My day only got worse from there, but thankfully that was the only episode.

1ljxri2,https://www.reddit.com/r/fnaftheories/comments/1ljxri2/new_book_theory_epiloguegames/,New book theory: EpilogueGames,"EpilogueGames is the theory that the epilogues of Frights and Tales and their connected stories are all canon to the games.

The main reasoning for this theory is that Scott 100% wrote the epilogues himself and and as such means they are reliable without a doubt. Remember, if Scott is able to retcon things, confirm theories with a comment then surely he can continue the series via novel format. In order to explain why the Tales epilogues themselves are in continuity but not the Tales stories we must first talk about StitchlineGames.

Here's what Scott said about the canonicity of the Silver Eyes trilogy.

>I wanted to talk about this a little bit to put everyone's minds at ease. I've gotten a lot of emails (even angry ones) complaining that the book doesn't match up with one or more of the games. Even some of the reviews on Amazon chastise the book for not matching the games. Something that I should have explained very early on is that the book is NOT intended to solve anything. It's not intended to be a guide for the games, or to fill in gaps. The games are what they are, and as I stated before, that story is finished. Something that I said in one of the forum threads about this, is that sometimes the lore of something can become so crowded that you can't tell an original story anymore. The games and the books should be considered to be separate continuities, even if they do share many familiar elements. So yes, the book is canon, just as the games are. **That doesn't mean that they are intended to fit together like two puzzle pieces.** I would actually ask anyone wanting to read the book, even if you are a devout fan of the games, to read the book for the sake of enjoying the book, and don't try to ""solve"" anything. The book is a re-imagining of the Five Nights at Freddy's story, and if you go into it with that mindset, I think you will really enjoy it. :)

The trilogy wasn’t made to fit with the games meaning they aren’t at all connected to the main continuity. Remember, Silver Eyes was a reimagining meaning certain events from the beginning HAD to be changed. An example is the exclusion of the puppet, in order for the Silver Eyes book to be its own seperate continuity they need to tweak events from the past to flow with the current story.

Here’s what Scott says about Frights.

>**New Book Series: (20%)**  
There is a new line of books on the way from Scholastic! This will be very different from the original book series, as it will be a collection of short horror stories that takes place in the FNAF universe. **The series will launch with five books, each containing three different short stories with unique characters and plot lines, some connected directly to the games, and some not.** That's everything for now! Time for more coffee!

SOME stories are connected DIRECTLY to the games. This means that only a few stories will be apart of the main continuity, how do we figure out which? Scott himself, THE EPILOGUES. The epilogues act as a follow up to the stories we’ve read. They tie up loose ends from the novellas while also picking up where the stories left off. The Stingers continue these stories via events being mentioned. Not only do these epilogues carry off a few stories from Frights but they also elaborate on where FNAF6 and UCN left off.

>I’ve enjoyed the memes roasting me about the plot-line lately, but it does have a serious underlying concern from many in the community, and I hear you. The question is this; is the lore solvable?

>Since that’s kind of like asking Is the story complete, **in an ongoing story,** it’s difficult to answer. So, let me say this instead. **Over the next few years there are a lot of projects planned, and most are very story driven. Lots of the later stories will answer some of the biggest questions from the fan base over this past year, in my opinion.**

>Very few people will likely ever feel completely satisfied, as there are just too many head canons out there and so many great ideas on where the story could go, but I think there are good things to be found for people who are looking. All I can do is say that some questions will be answered; even if it may not always be the answer you wanted. **Be patient.** Let me at least say this; **future games will look forward; but look to the novels to fill in some of blanks to the past!**

>Everyone in the community has been really great, and I’m working hard to bring you some great things in 2020 and beyond! :)  


Future games being the steel wool era and past games being Scott’s 1-UCN. The past games were an ongoing story that was cut off in UCN. When Scott says look to the novels to fill in some of blanks to the last what he meant is to look at the books to get a conclusion.

The Stingers go like this, years after the FNAF6 fire, the essence of the Vengeful spirit and Afton latch onto multiple objects. A possessed doll and Fetch are put together by a pseudo-scientist specialised in agony creating the Stitchwraith. The Stitchwraith gathers all the pieces and has them all together in a trash compactor. This in turn puts Afton back together which forms a giant trash amalgamation but is then defeated by a detective and the Puppet. 

You NEED context FROM the games to understand what the fuck is even happening. Have you understand Afton’s relation to evil/shadows then you’ll understand why Afton is a trash amalgamation referred to Jake as “an evil junk demon.” The Puppet’s cameo is a long build-up created by the games in a bittersweet finale for the series’ main villain. The Stingers quite literally FILL IN THE BLANKS.

So the epilogues of Frights are a direct continuation of the original story, this also explains why the epilogues are connected to certain stories from the book series. This is what Scott meant by “some are connected, while others aren’t.” The way those stories are connected to the epilogues is via events. 

If you are already familiar with how Stitchline works you can skip this next paragraph.

Sarah is directly stated to be missing and that witnesses saw her become trash. Eleanor is then the next big bad following Afton’s defeat.   
The Stitchwraith is scraping off remnants of the Plushtrap chaser on a train track.   
The ball pit, Jeff’s pizza, and its weird realm travelling shtick is in the epilogues.   
Millie is a spirit trapped in a weird place where she then gets her Happiest Day with the same family we see in Count The Ways. How’d she get there? Eleanor‘s blood is what’s keeping her tethered to this realm.   
The Fetch animatronic broke down in the rain.   
Phineas Taggart was mentioned in 1:35 am and the Ella doll makes an appearance in the 5th epilogue. Not only this but Eleanor can be seen tormenting Delilah which connects directly to 1:35 am.   
Hide and Seek, Step Closer, Blackbird, Dance With Me, Into the pit, and The man in room 1280 all appears as memories.  

ALL these stories are connected via EVENTS, they’re connected via follow-ups to these stories. They’re meant to EXPLAIN mysteries not create them.

What does this mean for the Tales epilogues? It means that ONLY the epilogues are canon. The only connection with the Tales epilogues and the rest of the stories is two links which are extremely weak: MIMIC and PIZZAPLEX. That’s it! Not even an event from another story is ever mentioned in the epilogues, only the character that is Mimic and the Pizzaplex’s abandoned FNAF6 building. The Tales epilogues create more mysteries in fact. How’d the Mimic go from point a to fucking point z? Why’s the Mimic all burnt? Why does he have rabbit like ears and a new head? How’d he end up in delivery truck? Where’s the context?

If we are to assume all the Tales stories are connected to the epilogues simply because of “Mimic” then we’ll have a giant mess in Frights since Freddy Fazbear makes a decent amount of appearances in stories that contradict each other. We’ve been shown time and time again that simply because a character makes another appearances doesn’t mean the two sources are to fit together. There’s also very little telling us that all the stories in Tales are call connected, Frailty’s only connection is Pizzaplex.

My main point is that follow-ups to an event or tragedy from a story needs to be picked up on by the epilogues in order for it to be canon. The Mimic story stopped as soon as an employee was killed and we didn’t even know if Fazbear Entertainment succeeded or not, even if they did we still don’t know why the Mimic ends up in a broken down state by Tales epilogue 1.

The Mimic story is more connected to the Storyteller than the Tales epilogues, remember that. The Tales epilogues are closer to Secret Of The Mimic than The Mimic story is.

TL;DR: the epilogues of Frights and Tales are all canon to the games and stories directly connected to those epilogues are also canon. The relation between the Tales epilogues and the other Tales stories are very weak whereas Stitchline makes the connections it does have strong.",2,1750830432.0,fnaftheories,4,0.75,False

1ljxnli,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ljxnli/strange_things_happen_after_midnight_at_this/,Strange things happen after midnight at this garage.,"Have you ever thought about how some roads *breathe*? Not in the metaphorical, ""stretching across the land"" way—no. I mean, literally breathe. Inhale. Exhale. Like they’re alive, pulsing just beneath the asphalt with something older than time and hungrier than death. Ever wonder why some roads seem to whisper, even when there’s no wind, no cars, no people—just you and that gnawing feeling that you’re not supposed to be there?

Route 47—an empty ribbon of cracked blacktop slicing through fields that seem to go on forever. Nothing but wind-warped fences, dead wheat, and the occasional skeleton of a long-abandoned barn. People around here don’t walk that road. Hell, they barely drive it after dark. And if you ask why, they won’t say much. Just glance at each other, mumble something about “the balance,” and change the subject.

I didn’t listen. I learned the hard way.

I'm a mechanic. Jack’s Garage. Twelve hours a day, six days a week. Same grease, same customers, same jokes, same coffee-stained clock ticking above the tool bench. Route 47 runs right past the lot, nothing but dust and heat shimmer by noon. For the first few years, it was just background noise. Engines humming. Tools clanking. Radios crackling with static-laced classic rock. Life was simple—until the *rules* showed up.

One night—late, sky the color of bruised fruit—I was closing up. Rolled down the bay door like I always did. That’s when Jack stopped me with one hand against the steel.

“Don’t shut it tight,” he said. Not asked—*said*. Firm. Like gravity hung on the hinge of that sentence.

I blinked. “What? Why?”

His eyes didn’t meet mine. He just tapped the metal and muttered, “Let it breathe.”

“Let *what* breathe?” I asked, forcing a laugh.

He didn’t answer. Instead, he stepped aside and pointed at the inside of the door. I stepped closer.

Long, jagged gouges stretched across the steel—deep, like something with claws had either tried to break *in*… or *get out*. I stared, and for a second—just a second—I felt a pressure in the air, like something enormous was holding its breath nearby.

From then on, I left that damn door cracked open exactly six inches. Not five. Not seven. Six. Jack said that was the balance point.

That night, I brushed it off as fatigue. Mechanics work hard, right? Maybe I was just overtired. Maybe. Still, the whole drive home along Route 47, I kept checking my rearview. No reason—just... a twitchy feeling under my skin. Then I saw them.

Headlights.

They flashed in my mirror once—twice. I looked again. Nothing there. Just the dark road stretching behind me like a mouth frozen mid-scream. My throat constricted as I forced myself to clear it, trying to shake the feeling that I wasn’t alone. I told myself it was just nerves, that sleep would fix it.

But then came the man.

Out of nowhere, a gaunt figure emerged from the shoulder of Route 47, one arm raised with a thumb pointing skyward like some broken marionette being yanked by unseen strings. He was barefoot, his feet blackened by the road. His shirt was gray, bleached by sun and sweat. His eyes—blank. As if someone had hollowed them out.

I slowed down. God knows why. Maybe pity. Maybe curiosity. Maybe something else.

“Need a ride somewhere?” I called out, leaning halfway out the window.

He stared at me for a long moment. His head tilted slightly, like he was trying to make sense of me. Then, without a word, he nodded and got in.

We didn’t exchange a single word the entire drive.

He sat perfectly still, hands in his lap, eyes forward. Like he was waiting for something. When we reached the gas station, he didn’t ask where we were. He just stepped out. Slowly. Deliberately. Then he walked behind the station and vanished into the shadows.

No thanks. No questions. Just a slow, deliberate exit—like he knew exactly where he was going, and it had nothing to do with me.

But the part that stuck with me? As I drove away, I saw him standing by the back fence, just watching. Unblinking. Like he was taking note of which direction I lived in.

Next morning? No trace. No footprints. No one remembered seeing anyone on Route 47 the night before.

I told Jack.

His face drained like someone had pulled a plug in the back of his skull. He rubbed his jaw and said something I’ll never forget:

“He’s not stuck. He *belongs* out there. If you let one in…” He paused. “Something else has to go out.”

That night, I called and called for my dog, Trixie. Sweet little mutt. Smart as a whip. Always came running when I jingled my keys.

But not this time.

She was just... gone.

Never came back.

I searched the fields. Posted signs. Nothing. Not even a scent trail. She vanished like she’d never existed.

And Route 47? It was quiet again. Balanced.

But now... every night, I leave that garage door cracked exactly six inches. I check the mirrors more often than I should. And I never—*never*—pick up hitchhikers.

Because some rides don’t end where you think they will.

And some passengers... never leave.

""And if you think that’s the strangest part of Route 47, you’re dead wrong. That was just the *beginning*. What happened *next*... still keeps me up at night.""

After that night... everything changed.

Jack wasn’t the same. His eyes moved faster, hands slower—like he was trying to stay a step ahead of something invisible. He started double-checking everything. Tools. Doors. Shadows. Me. It was like the whole garage had turned into some kind of stage, and Jack was suddenly very aware we weren’t the only audience anymore.

One morning, while the sun still bled through the shop windows, Jack pointed to the tool board.

“Every wrench,” he said, “every socket, every pry bar... has its place. Its number. Its weight.”

I nodded, half-listening—until one day I noticed a wrench missing. Just one.

So, I put it back. Thought I was helping.

But Jack's expression darkened like I'd scratched at something sacred.

“You took one?” he asked, voice low and slow.

“No,” I said. “I put it back.”

His eyes didn’t blink. “On odd days,” he muttered, tapping his temple, “tools should count odd. Keeps the unseen satisfied.”

That word. *Unseen*.

I counted them after he left. Thirteen tools. Odd. Safe. But the next morning, for no reason I can explain, I moved one into the drawer. Twelve.

That night, something *fell*.

I shot upright in bed, heart hammering like a nail gun against my ribs. The sound came from inside the room. I turned on the lamp, skin crawling—and there it was.

A single wrench, cold and gleaming, lying beside my pillow.

I hadn’t brought it home.

Things escalated.

Strange customer cars began showing up—vehicles that didn’t belong to any county, state, or reality I recognized.

One day, a black sedan rolled into the lot. Noon sun overhead, but the air turned cold. No license plate. Tinted windows darker than pitch. The driver wore a hood, smooth and tight like a sack over the head. No face—just shadow. The door opened slow, careful. As if the tools themselves might rebel.

Without a word, I began the oil change.

The engine rumbled—more like a growl than a machine. His hands never touched the wheel. When I dropped the pan and slid under, the temperature around me dropped. Breath fogged in the middle of summer.

Then—*tap tap tap*—he rapped on the dash. I paused. He stared, waiting.

“The filter’s tall,” I whispered, almost to myself.

He nodded once.

I grabbed the right one, replaced it, and sealed everything back tight. No smile. No nod. He handed me two bills. A five. A one.

Six dollars.

Then he backed out—engine silent—and disappeared into the wavering heat of Route 47 like he’d been a mirage. Only he wasn’t.

I turned to clean up the spill and found Jack behind me, wiping his hands with a shop rag like he’d seen it all before.

“Odd number in,” he said, shrugging. “Odd number out.”

like it meant something. Like it was law.

I glanced at the cash on the counter. Still just two bills. A five and a one. But the receipt machine had printed $13.00.

I picked it up again. Rubbed my fingers across the paper, thinking maybe I had typed it wrong.

“You saw me enter it,” I said, almost to myself.

Jack didn’t answer. He just walked past me and started putting away tools like it was any other Tuesday. But it wasn’t.

That night, I didn’t sleep. My mind spun like a stripped bolt. The moment the sun rose, I cornered Jack by the breaker panel.

“Jack... what the hell is this?”

He didn’t speak. Just smiled, stuck his hands deep in his coveralls, and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper.

A list.

Yellowed edges. Grease stains. Like it had been passed down a long, long time.

I read the first rule.

Rule 1: Do not let them know the rules until they understand the task.

Rule 2: Never close the garage door all the way at night.

Rule 3: Don’t pick up hitchhikers. If you let one in, something else has to go out.

Rule 4: Always leave an odd number of tools on the wall.

Rule 5: Never look out the back window after midnight.

Rule 6: Always return the ratchet to the same box.

By the time I got to the last one, I knew.

I wasn’t an employee. I was a *caretaker*. This garage wasn’t a business—it was a barrier. A line between what should stay *in* and what must stay *out*.

And I was stuck here until... *They* let me leave.

So I stayed. Fixed cars. Followed rules. Watched numbers.

But one night, while replacing a timing belt in bay three, I heard it—*tapping*.

Light at first. Barely a whisper. Then harder. More frantic.

It was coming from the back window.

I checked the clock.

12:05 a.m.

Rule 5 screamed in my head.

But curiosity—stupid, human, *doomed* curiosity—dragged my feet forward.

I peeked.

And I saw it.

A *thing*. Tall. Gaunt. Its elbows bent the wrong direction, too many joints in the arms. The head swiveled far past what a neck should allow. Its mouth never stopped moving—chattering, chewing, gnawing at words I couldn’t hear.

I killed the lights. Waited in silence.

When I looked again, it was gone.

But for the next seven days, every mirror I passed—rearview, bathroom, shop wall—I saw it standing behind me.

Not moving.

Just watching.

Then came the ratchet.

I left it in a toolbox behind the bay three car. Minor slip.

The next morning, I found it sitting *outside* the box—neatly placed. Not by my hand.

Beside it: tiny boot prints. Small. Like they belonged to a nine-year-old. But they were *wrong*. Deep. Metallic. Like someone had pressed down with lead instead of flesh.

I showed Jack.

He chuckled, but his eyes stayed on those prints too long. Too still. Then he wiped them away—fast.

And that’s when I knew.

I wasn’t just being *haunted*.

Something... was *coming for me*.

Something patient. Watching. Waiting for one more mistake.

And I made it.

That night.

That *final* night...

It was storming that night.

The kind of storm where the sky doesn’t just light up—it *burns*. Thunder didn’t rumble; it *slammed*, shaking the windows like fists pounding on glass. Jack had taken his truck home hours earlier. I stayed behind, grinding through a transmission job that wouldn’t wait.

And maybe that was my real mistake—staying when I should have run.

The storm clawed at the walls. Rain battered the roof like it wanted in. The rules... they weren’t just thoughts anymore. They *weighed* on me. Heavy. Breathing down my neck like old, angry ghosts.

I checked the clock.

11:57 p.m.

I did my rounds like a ritual.

The door? Cracked six inches. Tools? Thirteen, hung just right. No hitchhikers. No mirrors. No mistakes.

I closed my eyes for one second. Just one.

And then—I heard it.

*Footsteps.*

Slow. Wet. *Inside* the shop. Behind me. On the tile.

I didn’t turn. Not right away.

“Who’s there?” I called, voice shaking but firm.

Nothing answered.

I spun and flicked the lights.

They buzzed, stuttered—then flared on.

Outside, through the wash of rain, I saw it.

The black sedan.

Parked under the yellow flicker of the lot light.

Its hooded driver sat still, motionless. Not touching the wheel. His head... turned. Staring. Not at the shop, but *into me*, like he knew I’d break a rule soon.

The headlights burned through the glass. Blinding. Knowing.

Then the lights inside the garage *flickered*. Once. Twice.

I yanked open the fuse box.

Darkness.

But lightning struck just then, and in that white-hot flash, I saw *inside* the car.

And I wished I hadn’t.

Faces.

Dozens of them—featureless, pale—pressed to the inside of the sedan’s trunk window. Or maybe not the trunk. Maybe *inside* him. No eyes. No mouths. Just smooth skin, tight against the glass in perfect rows, all *leaning* forward.

Watching.

Waiting.

I ran.

I *ran* out into the storm. Rain hit like needles. My jacket clung to my skin. I didn’t stop. I didn’t look back.

Behind me—the garage door *slammed shut*.

Hard.

Too hard.

Someone had closed it all the way.

Someone had broken *Rule #2*.

I turned.

There he was.

The hooded man, walking slowly toward the garage. Every step deliberate. Every step echoing across the concrete. Methodical.

I spun to make for my truck—but froze.

In the mirror, in the rain-streaked rearview—I saw them.

Figures.

Tall. Too tall. Thin. Shadows that stretched and bent like film negatives burning at the edges. They didn’t walk. They slid.

All moving the same way.

Toward the door.

*Toward me.*

My breath caught.

I risked one last glance at the sedan.

Empty.

The hood left on the seat.

The trunk now wide open.

A gray, gnarled hand reached out—not to escape—but to *close it*. Soft. Silent. Sealing whatever it was back inside.

I felt something brush my ankle.

I looked down.

A wrench.

One I swore I’d already stored.

*Fourteen.*

Even.

Wrong.

I didn’t need to count the rest. I didn’t need more signs.

The rules were never meant to protect *me*.

They were to protect *them*—from whatever wanted in.

They needed *my obedience*. My blind, unblinking compliance.

And I failed.

I jumped in my truck and floored it.

Tires screamed. Water peeled from the pavement. The garage shrank in the mirror, swallowed by rain and night. I didn’t look back. I *couldn’t* look back.

I just drove.

Until morning.

And when I finally dared return to Jack’s?

It was gone.

No lights. No tools. Just a building sealed like a crypt.

The door was welded shut, scorched edges and all.

And scrawled across it in thick, black grease:

COUNT. ODD. BREATHE. DON’T LOOK.

Nothing else.

Just that.

A warning.

Or maybe... a promise.

Now?

I live in Tulsa.

Tiny apartment. No mirrors. No windows open. I’ve got a drawer full of tools—thirteen wrenches, fifteen sockets. All *odd*.

I never go near Route 47.

But when the thunder rolls and I catch a flicker in my reflection—something tall, with the wrong elbows—I know.

They’re still out there.

Sliding through the dark.

Waiting for someone else to forget.

Because the truth is this:

If you don’t follow the rules... something else will follow you.",3,1750830048.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

she has a stainless steel fountain that i clean every 2-3 days and fill with filtered fridge water. she drinks from it throughout the day and makes a pretty good dent in it by the time cleaning day comes around. but she will NOT stop drinking from my cup even when i redirect her to her fountain. she also gets wet food regularly so i feel like she definitely isn’t dehydrated and she pees a normal amount. 

does she suffer from pathological demand avoidance? does she have oppositional defiance disorder? does she just want dad’s water? her need for my water is disrupting my sleep cause god forbid i don’t hold the cup i’m getting drenched. 

you may say, dumbass, use a lid! great thinking. she will knock it over to get to my water. her greed sickens me. this is a more recent development. if i’m hanging with my roommates during the day she won’t even touch their water. she spots my cup? its over. a demon straight from hell. she doesn’t even take interest in other liquids such as coffee or tea.

1ljxiw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blogging/comments/1ljxiw9/still_not_stuck_choosing_stillness_without/,Still Not Stuck: Choosing Stillness Without Feeling Left Behind,"*I used to think stillness was a trap.*  
A slippery slope straight into irrelevance.  
The minute I stopped moving, doing, proving — the world would forget me, and I’d be left behind… in blush silk pants. (**Which, let’s be honest, is still a solid outfit to be left in.**)  
  
But something shifted recently.  
Okay, fine — something cracked open *(read: full-blown existential “what am I even doing” breakdown over coffee and to-do lists I never did).*

The truth? I started my new venture - *Wastra Story* because my house got too quiet.  
My son moved out.  
My thoughts moved in.  
And instead of sitting still and listening to them *(ugh)*, I picked up fabric and purpose and told myself,  
**“Here’s something meaningful to do.”**

It *was* meaningful.  
But also — it was a *beautifully disguised escape hatch.*

I wasn’t chasing success. I was running from stillness.  
And let’s be honest: *it worked.*  
**Until it didn’t.**

Because somewhere between sourcing fabrics, designing Instagram posts, and pretending I had a business plan, I started feeling… heavy.  
Not the *“too-many-pakoras”* kind. The *soul* kind.  
The kind that makes you question whether this is *passion* or just *performance in prettier packaging.*

And here’s the part that really messed with me:  
People *loved* what I was doing.  
Friends cheered me on.  
Strangers asked about events.  
Everyone saw *Wastra Story* and said, **“Wow, this is so you-you're so good at starting something new.”**

But I was starting to feel like I was watching someone else live that version of me.

And I couldn’t help wondering —  
*What if I didn’t want to be impressive right now?*  
**What if I just wanted to be real?**

So, here’s the thing:  
*Wastra Story* isn’t shutting down. It’s not a failed experiment or a heartbreak.  
It’s just… **shifting.**  
Slowing down.  
Moving to the backseat *while I move into the front of my own life again.*

Maybe it will return later — online, reimagined, or as something else entirely.  
Or maybe it did its job already:  
**it gave me the courage to admit I’m allowed to change my mind.**

# My Learning:

>

**“Still, Not Stuck.”**

These days, I’m letting myself **pause.**  
*Not as an end — but as an opening.*

I’m giving myself **3 months.**  
To write. To wander. To drink coffee without multitasking.  
To feel my feelings fully — *even the ones that don’t come with hashtags or applause.*

And no, I don’t have a five-year plan.  
But I do have a vision —  
of a woman by a window, draped in blush silk pants and a white crop top,  
thirty kilos lighter — both in body and baggage.

She’s not smiling for the world.  
She’s smiling because she finally feels like **herself** again.  
Unburdened. Unrushed. Unapologetically becoming.

Stillness used to scare me.  
*Now it feels like the bravest thing I’ve ever chosen.*  
I’m not stuck.  
I’m just finally *still enough to hear what’s next.*

So if you ask me today, *“What do you do?”*  
I’ll probably smile, sip my coffee, and say —  
**“I’m becoming.”**

And maybe that’s enough.  
*Maybe for now, that’s everything.*

# 💌 A little note, from one woman to another:

If you’re a woman reading this —  
and you’ve ever felt guilty for slowing down,  
or unsure of who you are without the doing —  
**I see you.**

You’re not fading.  
You’re just *finding.*  
Stillness isn’t the end of your story.  
**It might just be where the next one begins.**

If this made you *exhale*, *smile*, or whisper *“me too”* —  
I hope you’ll stay with me.  
I’ll be writing each week as I walk through this season of soft pauses, gentle truth-telling, and reimagining what it means to come home to myself.

**Let’s become —** ***bravely,*** **and maybe even** ***beautifully*** **— together.**

Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone. I’m exploring a small business idea and would love your input, lalo na if you’ve tried home-based setups or low-maintenance sideline businesses.

I live in **Teachers Village, Quezon City**, and we have an unused **patio and garden** at home. Around 40-50sqm total. I’m thinking of turning this space into either:

* A small, low-key **study café** for students (wifi, outlets, basic coffee/snacks) *- inisip ko ipa-aircon yung patio kasi baka too hot naman for studying if completely outdoor lang*
* Or a **rentable space** for org meetings, study groups, tutors, etc.
* Or maybe a **hybrid** — café on weekdays, event/study rental on weekends

I currently have a **full-time remote job**, so I’m looking for something I can manage quietly on the side — minimal overhead, minimal daily stress. This is not a full-blown café with baristas or full kitchen. More like a cozy, safe, affordable tambayan for students who need to study outside their dorms.

Here’s what I’d love help with:

1. **Has anyone tried a similar setup at home?** Did you go the café route or rentals? What worked?
2. **Permits** – If I start small and quiet (by reservation lang), do I need to register agad with barangay/DTI/Mayor’s permit or can I “test” it first for a few months?
3. **Low-maintenance tips** – Any suggestions on how to run something like this while still working a day job?

Bonus: If you’ve had experience with homeowners’ associations in QC, or barangay-level approvals for home-based businesses, any tips on how to approach them diplomatically?

Super appreciate any advice, insights, or even “don’t do it!” stories hehe. Salamat in advance!! Mwah mwah ",2,1750829553.0,BusinessPH,0,1.0,False
1ljxhog,https://www.reddit.com/r/LovedByOCPD/comments/1ljxhog/suspected_ocpd_does_this_sound_familiar_to_anyone/,Suspected OCPD – Does This Sound Familiar to Anyone?,"Over the past six months, I was seeing a man who, based on my observations, might have OCPD. A lot of his behaviors felt very “unique” — unfortunately, often in a negative sense. I’d love to hear your thoughts and experiences to see if my suspicions are valid, because I’ve read so much about this that it’s all starting to blur together in my head.

To give some context — we’re both in our 40s, so we’ve been around the block and have some life experience.

Here are the key things that stood out:

He had a strict daily schedule written down in detail — from the moment he woke up, including time for going to the bathroom, stretching, relaxing, breakfast, leaving for work, etc.

He worked a lot and was always doing something. Free time was extremely limited — only one coffee outing a week, Sunday was semi-free, and maybe Friday or Saturday night after 8:30 PM.

He couldn’t stand small talk.

He had hobby time scheduled several times a week — always doing the exact same thing.

He lived very eco-consciously: only traveled by bike, avoided flying, and didn’t like the idea of long-distance travel.

Very focused on cleanliness — washed hands thoroughly after coming home, even in the forest or while traveling he always carried hand sanitizer.

Cooking always had to be done with the kitchen fan on. At first, he didn’t let me wash dishes or load the dishwasher — later he agreed, but I could feel he was watching and checking how I did it.

He did laundry every single day, even though he lived alone. I wasn’t allowed to place anything on top of clean laundry — not even a shirt I’d been wearing. Bedsheets were only allowed after showering.

One time I brought him something in a plastic bag, and he asked me to take the bag back home because he doesn't use “things like that.”

His belongings were extremely organized — some were even labeled, like “black socks,” etc.

He bought me slippers to keep my feet clean before getting into bed.

When I had to change plans (for the first time, becouse kg mu kids) he got upset and told me to go home for the night. After that, he changed — became cold and distant.

He expected me to tell the truth to people he hadn’t even spoken to — he didn’t agree with me “hiding” anything from anyone, even if it was minor or unrelated.

The relationship started falling apart because, for me, spending just one night, one morning, and one day together per week simply wasn’t enough. When I told him this, it got worse.

He started treating me like an object — he decided when and where we’d meet, usually when he was already exhausted from doing things at home.

He wasn’t generous — didn’t get me anything for name day. For Valentine’s Day he said he’d take me to dinner, but when I joked “I eat dinner every day,” he got offended and said we didn’t have to go, since he’s not wealthy and would rather save the money.

He liked when I paid — for him and for myself. He was happy to receive clothes and things from me, but never bought any for himself.

I never really felt empathy from him. When I asked for advice, he’d always respond with “rules” or logic. It made me sad because he didn’t seem to see my needs or emotional state at all.

Very rigid and inflexible — meetings had to be planned well in advance.

Only one friend, most of his past friendships and relationships with women seemed to have fallen apart.

Very articulate, intelligent, reads a lot, owns a business — but has no interest in expanding it, making more money, or creating more space for enjoyment or a partner.

Even though I kept telling him I loved him and genuinely cared about him right up until the end, he just kept getting worse and worse towards me. Eventually, he told me he wasn’t in an exclusive relationship — that completely broke my heart.

I asked him to return all the things I had given him. At first, he said he wouldn't give everything back, but after I sent him a few blunt and pretty harsh messages, he packed everything up nicely, sent it back, and told me never to contact him again.

The whole thing was honestly really strange. Over the course of those six months, he turned into a totally different person. I’ve never experienced anything like it before.

That’s the short version ;) Does any of this sound familiar to anyone",2,1750829433.0,LovedByOCPD,0,1.0,False
1ljxhlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesopranos/comments/1ljxhlh/tony_survives_the_finale_heres_proof/,Tony survives the finale. Here's proof.,">!​!<I ate at Holsten's Diner awhile back and wrote up this IG post, pasted here for you groupies with a few added thoughts:

\- In real life, Tony’s booth is the only one with a mini jukebox, which doesn’t have Don’t Stop Believing;  
\- In the finale, Tony sits facing the door, as any wiseguy would. (Even I do this.) Then a mysterious man enters and sits at the counter for coffee. He keeps glancing in Tony’s direction, leading us to believe he’s a hitman. The spot where Mystery Man sits is directly between Tony and the door, so much so that it all but blocks Tony’s line of sight. No wiseguy in his right mind who’s carrying out a hit would sit directly in front of his target and linger around. As is common practice, he’d most likely run in, whack the guy, then run out;  
\- The front door doesn’t have a bell;  
\- When sitting in the booth you can’t help but keep glancing around;  
\- When Mystery Man slips off to the bathroom, he enters the door on the left, which in real life is the women’s bathroom;  
\- If Mystery Man is truly a hitman, the only way he’d have known where the Soprano family would be having dinner would be if he’d tailed one of them to the diner. When he slips off to the bathroom it’s an implicit nod to The Godfather, where a gun is hidden in the bathroom to carry out a hit. Assuming one of Soprano family was indeed tailed to the diner, the hitman wouldn’t have had the time or knowledge to plant a gun beforehand; and if he did have a gun on his person he wouldn’t have bothered to slip off to the bathroom in the first place. (Unless he was wanting to get the drop on Tony, but couldn't he have done that by just walking up and shooting him?);  
\- Most interpretations of Tony’s demise rely on symbolism —things said in previous episodes, other people in the diner, the screen going black, etc.— and not on the physical layout of the space or the events leading up to the Soprano family arriving at Holsten’s. All of this supports the argument I’ve wanted to be true since seeing the episode 14 years ago: Mystery Man is just a random guy walking around, a nod to Tony always having to look over his shoulder; but more importantly, TONY LIVES.

\- what is the standard serving when matcha is ordered (ice, late, or otherwise)?  
   2g? 4g? a teaspoon?

Context: I have just returned after well over a decade overseas. When I left Auckland's coffee scene was just really exploding, and its really cool to see how large it has gotten with so many cafes and roasters. This is something really special and surprisingly rare, as those who have travelled around a bit will know.   
However when before I left, it was standard that whenever you ordered a coffee the assumption was that it is a double shot. This seems to not be the case everywhere anymore, or perhaps I just ran into a few oddities?

Hey, I’m a 21 year old guy and after about a month of talking and hanging out, I finally asked a dude I like out. It supposed to be casual, just “Hey, you wanna grab coffee sometime?” kind of thing, but considering how close and personal topics kept coming up, i thought I’d shoot my shot. Surprisingly he said yes and even picked the place, so I was sure as hell down. Anyways, it went good for the first 30 minutes or so, chatting as usual if not a little bit more freely, and it was obvious we both got a little dressed up. But that’s when he said “You know, I’m bi more towards fem, meaning I like girls and feminine guys.” Which I’m obviously not, and all I could muster to say was “I understand.” And tried to play it off, but considering I’d usually say “Yeah I get it” instead I’m sure he picked up on it and added “But I’ve never really dated anyone, so I don’t know.” Which was obviously trying to soften the blow, which I understand and appreciate, but the message was clear. I kinda wanted to leave right there, but managed to keep it together and we hung out for another hour and a half, and it was a lot of fun, and it didn’t really hit me until I got back home, but when it did I felt really hurt. Like it’s obviously not his fault, he can’t change what kind of person he likes, but it didn’t help me feel less like I’m ugly and a piece of shit. So I cried, got it out of my system, and trying to not take it personally, but how do I? I’ve only been in one other relationship previously and didn’t ask anyone out before that, so it’s kinda new territory for me and I just don’t know how to process it. Like did I just misread the signs? Was he really trying and just realized it wouldn’t work out? I honestly don’t know, and we obviously still wanna be friends, but I’m just afraid these feelings won’t leave or I’ll begin to push him away. Idk, if anyone’s got advice, I’d greatly appreciate it.

I’m currently looking to connect with folks open to a coffee chat or video call to hear more about your experiences in architecture — whether it’s your current role, how you got started, or lessons you’ve learned along the way.

I’m a recent graduate from BCIT’s Architectural Science program, and while I know there are many opportunities in Vancouver, I returned to Toronto to support my family. Since April 2024, I’ve been actively applying to jobs and recently had a short-term role at a high-turnover firm that unfortunately ended after 1.5 months.

In the meantime, I’ve been doing what I can to stay connected — attending TSA, BEAT, and firm-hosted events, which led to meaningful conversations, including a video call with a principal who generously shared insights into their firm. I also started volunteering (currently with ULI), and although I’ve reached out to TSA and BEAT as well, I haven’t heard back yet.

Despite all this, I’ve been feeling discouraged lately — especially when comparing myself to others who’ve already landed roles in firms. I know I’m not alone in this, and I’m reminding myself that the journey into architecture can take many forms.

If you’re open to a chat or know someone who might be, I’d be so grateful to connect and hear your story through Reddit’s DM. Thanks so much for reading — and for anyone else in the same boat: keep going. You’re not alone.",0,1750828912.0,architecture,0,0.33,False

Back in highschool was the last time I had genuine friendships with guys. Everyone knew I was a lesbian and respected that, there was no one trying to make an effort to change me, no one had something rude to say about it, hell the guys even asked me for advice on dating girls. It just felt like everyone,no matter gender or sexuality, all got along and hung out and it was great fun. Then you grow up and things aren't fun anymore.

Something I've noticed, especially as being a big girl, is most men only give you the time of day if they are after you, otherwise they'll be dismissive and even rude. I've experienced this alot in the workplace, and have made it a habit to express that I'm lesbian as soon as possible, which usually chases away anyone with an ulterior motive... until it doesn't.

My most recent experience is meeting the son of a family friend who is a year older than me. He started speaking to me quite instantly and was very talkative,of which I am to, which was quite surprising. He also invited me to his birthday party, which seemed a bit odd as of a first meeting but I brushed it off. He was very polite,offering me his jacket as it was a rainy evening and offering to make coffee and such for me. I was happily thinking to myself that perhaps men with manners still exist untill he brought up the topic of dating...that's when I knew things were downhill from there. I quickly dropped the fact that I'm lesbian to which his demeanor quickly changed... bingo. However we left soon afterwards so I didn't think too much on it.

And then the birthday party arrived.

My parents and I were the only friends amongst family that were invited, assumingly since our parents are very close. He was quite busy with other guests and I was quite busy tearing up my steak(that was sadly over done) until a bit later in the evening when he started giving me his attention,once again offering his jacket and insisting I wear it( I told him it wouldn't fit since I'm bigger than him but he insisted) then asking me to dance with him, which gave him an ear full of complaining about how uncomfortable my shoes would be to dance in. He asked if id accompany him outside to have a smoke,and here come the dating topic again. He asks what I'm into,I say only girls. That however doesn't stop him offering me drinks,hanging off of me and whispering to his mother about me , causing her to say that he said I looked like a porcelain doll. By the time we have to leave, he hugs me a minimum of 5 times in a span of 10 minutes. At this time I'm too drunk and tired to give a shit and just want to go home and sleep.

I spoke to a friend about it in the morning and she made it clear boundaries were crossed and I need to tell him off if he does that again, which I do agree with. It just kind of hurts that once again a man is interested in me DESPITE knowing I'm a lesbian and not interested in men, maybe they have some big idea that they could change me. I just want to go back to the time when I could be friends with anyone WITHOUT feelings and that nonsense being involved. Everyone is so focused on romantic and sexual relationships that I may even get people upset saying this, but genuine friendships are so so so important too.

That’s not a metaphor.

The Chrome & Clover sat like a cigarette burn on the shoulder of Highway 17, just past the last gas station and the first lie the forest ever told. You could drive past it three times in a row and never see it unless your heart was cracked just right. Maybe you were grieving. Maybe dreaming. Maybe drunk. We got all kinds. No one normal ever walked in, and if they did, they didn’t walk back out quite the same.

My name’s Kit. I wore the name like I wore the apron. Grudgingly. Stubbornly. Like armor. I poured coffee for truckers and wanderers, things with too many eyes and names that had to be swallowed sideways. I listened. I didn’t ask questions. That’s the first rule in a liminal space: act like you belong.

So I never asked why the booths sometimes rearranged themselves. Or why the jukebox played songs no one remembered. I didn’t wonder why people came in sobbing and left smiling, or the other way around. I wiped the counters. I took orders. I made damn good coffee.

And then he walked in.

The bell above the door didn’t ring. It shivered. The air got colder, like the moment just before a kiss or a knife.

He wore a coat made of ravens. Real ones, I think. They never stopped watching me. His eyes were stormclouds spinning over a sea, and when he smiled, I remembered every bad decision I’d ever made and wanted to make them again.

Black, he said, no sugar.

When I asked if he wanted cream, he said, I’ve got enough of that in my veins.

So. One of those.

He came back the next night. Sat in the same booth. Didn’t say much, just watched me. He’d smile like I was a riddle he already knew the answer to. Every time he left, he’d leave a coin. Silver, cool to the touch, older than stars and just as cursed.

I should’ve tossed the first one in the river.

Instead, I started keeping them in a jar by my register.

He brought me gifts. A flower that bloomed with shadows. A cat that told fortunes and bit liars. A mirror. The mirror, actually. Small and round and framed in brass, like something your grandmother left behind along with unfinished stories and faint perfume.

When I looked into it, I didn’t see myself. Not exactly. I saw a version of me that hadn’t been folded, flattened, dimmed by bills and long nights and other people’s needs. She stood tall, eyes bright, hands glowing with heat. Steam curled from her fingertips like she could command it.

It’s you, he said, as you might be.

I told him to shove it.

He laughed. You’re glorious when you lie.

And then he kissed me.

I don’t remember the transition.

One blink I was in the booth, the next I was falling upward, weightless, through stars that screamed lullabies. Then landing. Soft, like a sigh.

And I was no longer in the world I knew.

The palace of the Cruel Fae Prince wasn’t made of stone. It was made of regret and starlight and the long-dead notes of forgotten violins. Its towers spiraled in ways your eyes couldn’t follow. The halls rearranged themselves like thoughts you weren’t supposed to think. The windows looked into moments that hadn’t happened yet and maybe never would. The light came from nowhere and cast shadows that tried to whisper secrets in your ear.

He called it Eirellien, though the name changed each dawn. Tain himself walked beside me through corridors that rippled like water when you blinked, his raven-feather cloak rustling with quiet amusement. The walls sighed when he passed. Some of them wept.

Welcome home, he said, voice like melted silver. Or rather, welcome to where you were always meant to be.

I didn’t answer. He touched my shoulder like he owned it. I elbowed him. It went through him. His ribs weren’t there unless he wanted them to be.

You’ve been Chosen, he said, for greatness, of course. For majesty. For me.

I said the only thing that made sense. Where’s the nearest kitchen?

He laughed. And gods, how he laughed. It echoed for minutes. It cracked glass. One of the towers melted just a little.

I never said anything funny. It was all him.

He assigned me rooms in the west wing of the palace, which was only there on Thursdays and during eclipses. The furniture floated slightly. The bed slept you, not the other way around. I wrapped myself in the only thing that felt real—my apron, which I’d kept balled in my back pocket even through interdimensional abduction. I tied it on like a general putting on medals.

The court was a nightmare of etiquette and beauty. Nobles made of wind and ivy, of bone and lace and old jealousy. Courtiers wore masks of their lovers’ faces, changed mid-sentence. Dancers bled rhythm from their feet. Laughter always had teeth. There was a harp made of human ribs that played itself whenever anyone lied nearby. It never stopped playing.

Tain reveled in it. He was a tyrant wrapped in silk and poetry. Every cruelty he committed, he dressed up in elegance. He never raised his voice. He never needed to. Power clung to him like perfume. The others adored him. Or feared him. In Faerie, it’s the same thing.

He expected me to wilt. Expected me to cling to him. I think he even expected me to fall in love with him. I smiled. I served tea. I watched. I learned.

They called me the Stolen One, then the Mortal Flower, then the Hearthbroken. Titles were currency here. Every time they named me, I got a little more dangerous.

I found the kitchens one night by accident. Or maybe they found me.

They weren’t rooms. They were a place, older than the palace, older than Faerie. There were ovens carved into the backs of sleeping giants. Cauldrons that stirred themselves with iron bones. Spice jars that screamed when you opened them and sugar that remembered your childhood. The walls were hung with pans forged from dying stars. The hearth-fire was alive and knew my name.

It welcomed me. The fire curled toward me, wrapped around my wrists like bracelets. I put my hand into the flame and felt no pain—only memory. My grandmother’s kitchen. The scent of cinnamon and tears. My first paycheck. A midnight diner kiss that never led anywhere. All the warmth I had ever given and never gotten back.

I fed the fire my name, and it gave me a new one in return. I didn’t speak it aloud. Names are dangerous here.

I stayed in that kitchen for hours, maybe days. Time in Faerie is a suggestion, not a law.

And I remembered something my grandmother once whispered to me when I burned the toast for the first time.

The fire knows if you're real. It knows if you're ready.

I was ready.

The next court gathering, I wore no gown. I wore my apron. I wore a smile. I poured coffee from a kettle that had learned to sing in three languages of grief. I stirred it with a spoon that knew the sound of bone breaking. I offered cups to the nobles and watched them sip and shudder and taste things they had long forgotten: humility, homesickness, a child's forgiveness, shame.

I was still the waitress. But the apron had become a crown. The pot had become a scepter.

And Tain noticed.

You’re changing, he said one night, watching me from a throne made of folded promises.

No, I told him. I’m remembering.

He smiled, but there was tightness behind it. Like he’d bitten something bitter. He offered me gifts. Jewels that whispered secrets. Rings that turned time backwards. A dagger carved from moonlight.

I refused them all.

He kissed me again.

This time, I didn’t close my eyes.

I began walking the palace not as a captive, but as a storm in slow motion. The lesser fae bowed their heads when I passed. I heard them murmur new names. The Iron Flame. The Queen of Steam. The Bitter Cup.

I started keeping a ledger in my apron pocket. A list of the names of those who had been lost here. Mortals taken, broken, forgotten. A tally of all the wounds Tain had disguised as romance.

When I slept, the dreams came. I stood behind a counter that glowed with starlight. My hands brewed constellations. I poured futures into mugs and handed them to strangers I’d never met, but somehow knew.

I was changing. Or rather, waking up.

One night, I returned to the mirror he had given me on the third night in the diner. I took it from the Hall of Hungers, where it was displayed like a trophy.

It showed me again. Not as I was. As I would be.

Tall. Calm. Smoke rising from her shoulders. Her eyes were firelight through glass. Her voice would be honey over razors. She was waiting. Patient. Furious. Divine.

I pocketed the mirror. Returned to the kitchens.

And I began to plan.

The Ceremony of Wounding was held beneath the open sky of never, in a courtyard paved with cracked oaths and spilled wine. Every noble arrived barefoot, cloaked in their oldest triumphs, wearing the skins of stories they had won through cruelty.

Each one stepped to the speaking pool. Told the court the greatest hurt they had ever caused. Their pride. Their prize. The currency of power.

I stood among them, silent, waiting.

Tain went last.

He ascended the dais with that same maddening grace, his cloak of ravens trailing shadows that whispered half-remembered lullabies. The pool shimmered before him, waiting to be fed.

He began to speak.

And I walked in.

I wore my apron. My eyes glowed with firelight. My hands steamed. The kitchen spirits danced in my veins.

I stepped past the nobles. Past the guards. Past the fear.

I held out a cup.

You want to share your heartbreak? I said. Drink mine first.

He laughed. But his eyes did not.

He drank.

He screamed.

He fell.

Because I had brewed into that cup every insult he ever fed me. Every smirk. Every theft of agency. Every silken cruelty. I had stirred in the memories of the mortals he’d stolen. The pain of the wild hunt. The regrets of children forgotten. The bitterness of love turned prison.

I boiled it all. I filtered it through myself.

He choked. His mouth smoked. He dropped to his knees. The pool shattered.

His throne cracked.

I did not take it.

Instead, I turned and walked away.

To a door I had carved from memory and steel and linoleum. A diner door. A sacred door. The Chrome & Clover waited on the other side. Rebuilt. Reclaimed. No longer only on Highway 17.

Now it sits between worlds.

I opened the doors. Turned on the lights. Fired up the griddle.

The line is already forming.

Dryads. Fauns. Gods. Exiles. Poets. Shadows.

All hungry.

I pour the coffee.

It tells the truth.

Some nights, Tain sits in the corner booth and watches me. He does not speak.

Some nights, I catch my reflection in the coffee pot. She smiles back. The woman I was. The woman I became. The firelight and the iron. The waitress and the witch.

I’ve got steam in my hands. Moonlight in my coffee. Fire in my heart.

And I’m still taking orders.

Just don’t forget to tip.

The culinary landscape on June 24, 2025, saw a diverse mix of developments, from personal nutrition struggles and the rise of wellness trends to technological advancements in the kitchen and the ongoing conversation around accessible food resources. The day’s news highlights both the evolving ways we consume food and the tools and philosophies shaping our relationship with it.

One of the most prominent themes emerging from the day's news is the internal conflict many people experience when it comes to food and nutrition. One individual, wrestling with the ""imposter syndrome"" inherent in the wellness-focused online culture, perfectly encapsulates this struggle. The source describes the internal battle between a meticulously health-conscious side – diligently tracking protein intake, hydrating with chia seed water, and supplementing with Vitamin C – and another that revels in the convenience of ordering takeout multiple times a week and indulging in late-night coffee and instant ramen. This juxtaposition underscores the societal pressures of adhering to rigid dietary ideals while simultaneously craving the comfort and ease of less health-conscious choices. The individual's ""latest indulgence,"" matcha, a beverage embraced by both wellness enthusiasts and meme creators, highlights the way in which trendy food items can represent this duality. This tension reveals the complexity of navigating the food landscape and the challenges of balancing personal health goals with the realities of modern life.

Alongside the individual’s personal reflections, the news emphasized resources and tools designed to help consumers navigate this complex food environment. The launch of a new season of ""Comfort Eating"" featuring Grace Dent and celebrity guests, offers an avenue for engaging with food in a less structured format. The promise of candid conversations and shared experiences around food suggests a counterpoint to the often-pressured environment of wellness.

Further emphasizing the practical tools available to consumers, the Guardian Feast app stands out as a resource for culinary success. Promising a library of 6,000 recipes at one's fingertips, the app aims to reduce kitchen stress. With features like ""cook mode"" and the ability to save recipes, the app seeks to empower home cooks with accessible inspiration. The offer of a 14-day free trial and a 30% discount on annual subscriptions, running until July 13, 2025, suggests an eagerness to attract and retain users. This initiative speaks to a broader trend: the increasing integration of technology into the cooking process, aiming to streamline and simplify food preparation.

This trend is further reflected in the ongoing discussion around kitchen appliances. Engadget’s review of the best rice cookers for 2025 highlights the growing sophistication of kitchen technology. The article points out how these appliances take care of ""timing, temperature, and technique,"" which removes the need for constant stovetop supervision. This technological approach offers convenience and consistent results, making it easier to cook rice perfectly every time. The appeal of rice cookers is attributed to their versatility, suggesting they're suitable for both quick weeknight meals and larger family gatherings. This focus on efficiency and reliability speaks to the desire for convenience and dependable results in today's busy lifestyles.

In summary, the food news of June 24, 2025, paints a picture of an industry undergoing significant shifts. On one hand, we see a growing awareness of the multifaceted relationship individuals have with food, which involves the internal struggle between health-conscious choices and the allure of convenience and comfort. On the other hand, there is a clear trend of tools and resources emerging to help consumers navigate this landscape, offering everything from convenient apps filled with recipes to smart appliances designed to simplify cooking. From the personal battles with nutrition to the technological advancements in the kitchen, the news reflects a changing approach to food. The focus on both accessible resources and the inherent complexities of our relationship with food underscores the dynamic and evolving nature of the culinary world in 2025. This mix of personal introspection and technological advancements suggests a future where food is viewed as both a deeply personal experience and a subject of technological innovation.

1ljwyd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasy_books/comments/1ljwyd3/dreamscapes_and_broken_music_wandering_through/,Dreamscapes and Broken Music: Wandering Through Charles de Lint’s Newford (Remastered),"As I entered Newford, someone was playing music under a bridge while talking to ghosts. Or maybe they were painting doorways that led into other worlds. Maybe it was just Jilly Coppercorn telling stories with her hands, trying to heal the world one dream at a time. That’s how it is with Charles de Lint’s Newford series: you never walk in through the front door. You stumble in sideways, like you’ve taken a wrong turn on a rainy night and ended up somewhere just a little too strange to be safe, but too beautiful to leave.

Newford isn’t a city on any map. It’s a fictional North American sprawl of music venues, artist lofts, soup kitchens, shelters, junk shops, and liminal spaces where myth bleeds into everyday life. 

Since Dreams Underfoot (1993), Charles de Lint has been sketching the magical world of Newford’s streets in story after story, turning what started as a loosely linked set of urban fantasies into a deep, resonant mythos. This isn’t fantasy about kingdoms and battles. This is about surviving in the aftermath of a nightmare. About waking up haunted, picking up your guitar, and still choosing light.

De Lint began his career in high fantasy with The Riddle of the Wren, Moonheart, The Harp of the Grey Rose, but with Newford, he brought the magic home. Instead of distant forests and named swords, he gave us folk singers with fey blood, street kids with second sight, and painters whose canvases could open doors to other realms. The mythology here isn’t borrowed from a single source. It’s a bricolage: Celtic tricksters, Indigenous spirit animals, dreamtime constructs, and invented folklore, all braided together into something wholly his own.

Memory & Dream (1994) is one of de Lint’s most layered,  powerful and breathtaking works. It follows Isabelle Copley, an artist whose talent conjures the fantastic into physical being. She paints the numena, strange beings from other realms, and pays the price when one of them lingers too long. This is a book about abuse, about artistic integrity, about memory, about the times where dreams and horrors overlap. It’s quintessential Newford: fiercely compassionate, quietly magical, and emotionally devastating.

Someplace to Be Flying (1998) is a sprawling urban myth that dives into the animal people, beings who’ve lived alongside humanity in secret. Coyote, Raven, and Crow walk the streets, sometimes taking human form, sometimes not, playing long games of fate and renewal. Here, we meet the Crow Girls: Maida and Zia. Wild, chaotic, joyful, mischievous, they are tricksters without malice, ancient spirits wearing teenage goth girl bodies. They dance through these books like a windstorm in a vintage clothing shop, giggling, hungry, full of unpredictable kindness and barely suppressed power. They aren’t just comic relief. They’re chaos as compassion. Innocence without ignorance. They’re unforgettable.

The Crow Girls return in The Onion Girl (2001), where the series takes its most raw and personal turn. Jilly Coppercorn, beloved painter and perennial center of the Newford circle, is hit by a car and left paralyzed. As her body heals slowly in the waking world, her mind wanders into dreamlands, interior worlds formed from suppressed trauma, wonder, and long-forgotten pain. What surfaces is a history of childhood abuse, a lost sister, and the ragged path toward healing. It’s not an easy book, and de Lint doesn’t pretend otherwise. He doesn’t sensationalize trauma—he traces its scars with care, showing that survival is not the end of the story, only a beginning.

Widdershins (2006) picks up that story and pushes it forward. Jilly is stronger now, but still shaken. The book widens its scope, exploring the fraught tensions between the North American animal spirits and the invading Celtic ones—an echo of real colonial history played out in the spirit world. It’s one of de Lint’s most political books, grappling with appropriation, reconciliation, and the possibility of cultural healing. And through it all, the Crow Girls are there, weaving between the serious and the surreal, eating too much sugar and saving the day in ways no one expects.

Trader (1997), at first glance feels like a departure, no Jilly, no Crow Girls, no familiar cast, but underneath, it’s all Newford. Max Trader is a luthier, a quiet man who builds guitars and lives a careful, contained life until one morning he wakes up in someone else’s body. He’s been body switched by a man who wants a better life. What unfolds is part Kafka, part urban fable: a story about identity, loss, and how much of us is tied to our physical selves. It’s also one of de Lint’s most emotionally subtle works, and one of his most deeply compassionate. Max’s struggle to rebuild, to reclaim not just his body but his sense of self, mirrors the journeys of so many Newford characters. Because really, all of them are trying to come home to themselves.

If The Onion Girl and Widdershins are the emotional and spiritual core of the series, then the short story collections are its heartbeat. Dreams Underfoot lays the groundwork, introducing us to Geordie Riddell (musician), Christy (journalist, maybe a bit too close to the author), Jilly, Wendy, and others. Each story is a window into the wider city, often featuring characters on the margins—runaways, addicts, artists, the haunted and the healing. The Ivory and the Horn (1995) continues this, darker and grittier, showcasing the city’s underside without losing its glimmer of hope. In Tapping the Dream Tree (2002), the magic gets weirder. Stranger beings slip in. Time and space get bendy. But the warmth, the empathy, the commitment to wonder remains constant.

The Blue Girl (2004) is a novel that stands perfectly alone but fits cleanly into the Newford tapestry. Imogene, a high school misfit with dyed hair and a dead friend, stumbles into a war between dream spirits. It’s a story about being young and othered, about loneliness and defiance and the strange safety of being seen by something else. 

The Painted Boy (2010) goes even farther, stepping outside of Newford proper and following a Mexican-American teen in Arizona discovering a hidden dragon lineage. It’s one of de Lint’s most overtly magical and diverse stories, and it extends the Newford sensibility, empathy, myth, art, redemption, into a new geography.

One of the things that defines Newford is that the magic always costs something. These aren’t stories where the hero wins a sword and everything is fixed. Instead, they ask: how do you keep creating when you’re in pain? How do you forgive yourself for what happened to you? How do you let others help you carry the burden? De Lint’s characters grow, break, rebuild. They relapse. They relapse again. They fall in love, mess it up, try again. They find grace in the small things: a song played under a streetlight, a stranger’s unexpected kindness, a memory shared over coffee.

And always, there’s the city. Newford feels like it remembers you, even if you’ve never been there. It’s a place where the border between the numinous and the everyday is tissue thin, but no one walks through it alone. The books form a kind of emotional atlas—each story another pin on the map, another ghost in the stairwell, another song drifting up from the subway.

Charles de Lint may not be writing Newford as often now. He’s turned more toward music, to quieter novellas, to living his own life. But the city remains. Not just in print, but in spirit. It’s out there, in a mural you walk past too quickly, in the busker who looks like he might have wings under his coat, in the girl sitting on the bench who talks to birds like they answer back.

Want to hear a story? There’s this city, see. Not on any map. But if you close your eyes, you might get there. Just follow the music. And if you see two girls in black tutus feeding crows french fries and laughing at the sky—tell them Jilly sent you.",1,1750827541.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False
1ljwy26,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalScience/comments/1ljwy26/how_to_improve_stand_out_as_an_elected_official/,How to improve & stand out as an elected official.,"Hello political scientists! I (M20s) am a part-time city councilman in a city of about 15,000 people. I have worked hard to stand out as a problem solver and community advocate, and I believe I have a small but supportive base of supporters that live in the city. I deeply care about my community and especially those who are facing very tough times. I also work hard to prioritize the middle class who are in the tough spot of making too much money to qualify for assistance, but too little to cover all their bills.

I’ve been told that I’ve been doing a very good job representing our community, but I really want to keep up, improve my legislative skills, and really stand out as a young leader in my community, and possibly even on social media. I hope you read through some of what I’ve been working on and perhaps even answer the questions below.

So far, I’ve taken these actions:

* Irregularly hold coffee hours, usually on a specific topic
* Hold large town halls on controversial topics
* Show up to events
* Try to be proactive on social media and answer people’s questions about the city
* Host small events with local organizations
* Advocate for local issues, and state and federal issues by writing letters on behalf of residents to decision-makers at those levels
* Write resolutions or ordinances that solve local issues

I think I could be doing more. I’ve got some ideas, but I’m not sure how effective they will be:

* I am considering a door-knocking campaign to speak to people about their specific concerns
* Starting up a monthly newsletter
* Running targeted social media ads
* Helping to set up neighborhood watch groups around the city
* Hosting a yearly community barbecue
* Writing an op-ed in the newspaper

My main goal is to really help people in our community understand that we can only fix our city's problems by investing ourselves in a solution. I also see myself as a person working within a very frustrating system, for residents and for me, but always fighting for us.

I’m interested in possibly running for higher office in the future and would like to be prepared to run should the opportunity arise. However, my main goal is to advocate as best I can at the city level, build community, and raise people’s voices.

If you read this far, I’ll provide a summary of what I am interested in hearing about:

* What events can I do that will be more effective and will draw in less engaged residents?
* Other than the local issues that I am well-versed in, what local issues or initiatives are picking up steam around the country that I can research for implementation in our community?
* How can I use my platform to bring more people together in our community and on social media?

* Steamed broccoli
* 1 boiled egg on the side

* Baked salmon

I’m struggling to find a wireless headset with decent mic quality for calls. 

I’ve watched a dozen videos with call quality comparisons and they all sound like vintage “call-center” gear from the 1980s? Even the Yealink models in the “best of” videos come across as tinny. Poly sounds like a muffled tin can. 

What I really need is an over-ear, single or dual-ear headset that I can wear all day in a lightly active eight-person office, for Google Meet and other online phone calls. ANC is nice but I don’t work in a call center or have barking dogs nearby. Just the occasional person talking nearby, or the occasional coffee shop work day.

I've been on amphetamine salts (adderall) for about a year now and it always felt great. But all good things come to an end... Last week, my pharmacist gave me my normal medication for the month, which is Adderall 30mg XR but this time it wasn't from Apotex. Instead, he gave me amphetamine 30mg XR from Ascent Pharmaceuticals.

At first, for the first couple days, I didn't understood why my meds weren't working. I'm on the highest dose possible and everytime I used to take them, I was fired up. But it wasn't the case for the last few days... I came to the conclusion that it was the actual brand behind the molecule that's at fault and I'm now 100% sure.

Yesterday, I went full turbo mode and took 3 x 30mg of the faulty ones, the ones from Ascent Pharmaceuticals, and I didn't feel a thing. I ain't joking, it was the same as when I take a coffee and a half. FYI, 90mg amphetamine is suppose to make you crazy geeked, like really fuckin high. I wasn't.

This morning I found one of my old pill, 30mg from Apotex, and I took it. I ain't joking, I'm feeling crazy good, the feeling you get when you stop your meds for a week or two. The problem is, I didn't stop taking my meds for a week, I JUST SWITCHED BRAND. This is crazy.

My dad's a retired pharmacist and each time I told him about the different effects I get from different brands, he thinks I'm bat-shit crazy... But since I've told him this story, I sparked his curiosity and atleast he listened without disproving it straight away. He doesn't wanna believe it because he's been a pharmacist for 40 years and just retired last year without ever knowing this bullshit but still, the proof is here.

* Willing to get rid of ANYTHING except: chifforobe, dining table *base (willing to replace the top)*, dining light, kitchen island, the cats
* We're very handy so happy to build in shelves or anything as well!

1ljws1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingApps/comments/1ljws1z/which_dating_app_has_the_most_serious_guys_for/,Which Dating App Has the Most Serious Guys for Long-Term Relationships?,"I totally get the hesitation about dating apps – the horror stories are real, but so are the success stories! Let me break down which apps actually work for finding serious relationships and share some real success stories to give you hope.

The Apps That Actually Lead to Marriage

**eHarmony: The Marriage Champion**

eHarmony consistently ranks as the #1 app for marriages. The data is pretty impressive: about 4% of eHarmony users marry someone they met on the platform, and the app creates a new love connection every 14 minutes. What makes it different? The extensive personality questionnaire (takes 30-40 minutes) and the fact that your profile must be 50% complete before you can even send a message. This naturally filters out people who aren't serious.

eHarmony reports that over 2 million couples have found love through their platform, and according to their ""*Married Couples by the Numbers*"" report, almost three-quarters of users meet their spouse within a year of joining. The app accounts for 2% of all U.S. marriages, which is significant given how many ways people can meet.

**Match.com: The Relationship Veteran**

Match. com has the best long-term relationship success rates according to multiple studies. A Consumer Research survey found that 38% of Match users had relationships lasting longer than a month, and 33% had relationships lasting longer than six months. Match is responsible for bringing 1 million babies into the world through couples who met on the site.

**Hinge: ""Designed to Be Deleted""**

Hinge markets itself as the app ""designed to be deleted,"" and actually means it. What sets it apart is the prompt-based system that encourages real conversations rather than superficial swiping. You respond to specific parts of someone's profile instead of just swiping on photos. The app limits you to 8 likes per day (unless you pay), which forces more intentional choices.

90% of Gen Z Hinge users are looking for something serious, and conversations that comment on specific profile prompts are 3 times more likely to get responses.

**The Apps to Consider (With Reservations)**

***Coffee Meets Bagel: Quality Over Quantity***

Coffee Meets Bagel positions itself as the best app for serious relationships by focusing on quality matches over quantity. However, user experiences are mixed – some report very low response rates and suspect fake profiles.

***Bumble: Women-First Approach***

Bumble can work well for serious relationships, especially since you can filter by relationship intentions. Many success stories come from Bumble, and the fact that women message first can lead to more thoughtful conversations. However, the 24-hour message window can be problematic if people aren't active on the app.

**What the Data Shows About Serious Users**

Paid apps generally attract more serious users. When people invest money, they're typically more committed to the process. Free apps like Tinder have massive user bases (630 million users) but are primarily associated with hookups.

**Key statistics to consider:**

* 44% of adults use dating apps specifically to find long-term partners, not casual hookups 
* Research shows that 39% of heterosexual couples and 60% of same-sex couples now meet online 
* People who meet online are more likely to be compatible and have healthier marriages 

**Real Success Stories That'll Give You Hope**

Here are some actual success stories from real people:

**From Reddit users:**

""*Met my wife on Bumble. We chatted for a week, FaceTimed before our first date, and now we've been married for 3 years with a 7-month-old son.*"" 

""*Met my guy on Tinder 7 years ago. Married him in 2023 and currently sitting in bed having just put down our 3-month-old*"" 

""*We met on Hinge five years ago and got married earlier this year!*"" 

**More inspiring stories:**

""I*t was my first Tinder date, and almost 7 years later, we're engaged and have our two-month-old little boy!*"" 

""*We met on Bumble after he said something about garlic bread. Six years on, we got married in May!*"" 

""*I met my fiancé on Tinder, 8 years ago, we have a baby on the way*"" 

**Pro Tips for Finding Serious Guys**

Choose Your App Strategically

For marriage-focused dating: eHarmony or Match. com 

For relationship-minded millennials/Gen Z: Hinge 

For women who want control: Bumble (with relationship filters) 

**Red Flags to Avoid**

* Guys who won't video chat before meeting
* Profiles with only shirtless photos
* Anyone pushing to ""*hang out*"" at their place for a first date
* Profiles that say ""*just seeing what's out there*"" or ""*not looking for anything serious*""

**Green Flags to Look For**

* Detailed profiles that actually answer prompts thoughtfully
* Clear face photos and lifestyle shots
* Mentions of relationship goals, family values, or future plans
* Willingness to have phone calls or video chats before meeting



**TL:DR**

eHarmony and Match. com have the highest success rates for marriages and serious relationships, but they require paid subscriptions. Hinge is the best free option for serious dating, especially for younger users.

The key isn't just which app you choose – it's being clear about what you want and not settling for less. As one successful user put it: ""*Don't accept anything less than what you deserve on dating apps — some people are only after one thing, but you don't have to just accept that that's how it is*"".

Remember, nearly 40% of couples now meet online, and people who meet through dating apps are actually more likely to have successful marriages. The horror stories get all the attention, but the success stories are happening every day – you just need to choose the right platform and approach it with intention.

I’ve been struggling with depression for the past year, and I think a lot of it was triggered by the emotional weight of the ongoing boycott. I’m in my 5th year of medical school, and for a long time, I tried to hide how bad things were getting — until I finally opened up to my parents. Thankfully, they’ve been really supportive after realizing just how much I’d been keeping to myself.

This year’s been rough. I couldn’t prepare properly for my finals, and I’ve been seriously considering taking a gap year to give myself time to breathe and recover. I was on antidepressants for a while, but unfortunately, they made things worse and increased my suicidal thoughts. I wasn’t prescribed any benzos alongside them, so I had to stop taking them for safety.

Right now, I’ve decided to spend a month in Essaouira to reset and hopefully get my shit together again. If anyone here lives in Essaouira and would like to hang out sometime or just chat over coffee, let me know. Would be nice to make new friends.

Thankieees.

*‘Day… I’ve stopped counting.. Although it’s just a few pages back, I don’t want to make too much noise or else either of them will yell at me to go sleep outside. This is another letter to you.. Rei. It’s the only thing that makes me feel better.. Believe that you come back when I’m asleep and read these letters I leave for you. Why.. did you leave me here in this awful place? I’m sorry I ask the same question so much. It just feels like the abuse gets worse and worse everyday… For example, today.. They dunked my head in water for accidentally using white pepper instead of garlic powder in the food. I still have water in my ears… My throat feels clogged as do my sinuses. You.. said you’d come back.. And- Maybe you are here, but why won’t you stay with me? You said you’d come back. You said it! …Anyways, tomorrow I’m turning 16.*

*I’m sure you’d know that.’*

I quietly put away the journal and wooden pencil, careful as I made sure the ‘*Judge*’ was still praying loudly downstairs. Not something unusual. I quietly stepped away from the window and crawled into bed, getting under the itchy fabric since it was a cold night. I had suffered enough for the day.   
My head rested at the corner of the pillow, watching the moon and the northern star outside my window. The only thing that gave me light to write my letter to Rei and the constant thought of Rei. I couldn’t help but think back to how it was when it was just the ‘*Nun*’ and I. She was kind and taught me how to read and write. I can’t continue to wonder what happened when the Judge came back. That was when all this abuse started.   
I learned how to be quiet as a mouse. I learned to listen so careful that I could detect the anger in their voices before there’s even a hit. I learned how to protect my head. I learned how to hold my breath for long periods of time. I learned how to trick my mind that I wasn’t hungry when they starved me. I learned that no matter what you do, the abuse won’t stop.  
I can’t even run away into the beautiful woods.   
I learned that… I’m stuck here forever.   
There is no salvation. 

I hadn’t noticed I was crying. Silently of course. I simply rubbed my face into the pillow to wipe off the tears and turned over.   
Turning over meant revealing a truth to this eerie feeling behind my back. I only wished that by turning over, I’d get over this sickening feeling in the pit of my stomach and finally be able to rest for as long as they’d let me. 

I shouldn’t have turned over. The night's horror began too early. I met the eyes of the Judge. They bore into the back of my head. I jumped and wanted to scream but the Judge lunged his arms forward. One around my neck and the other over my mouth. The adrenaline kicked in but the grip around my throat began to cease the oxygen intake. I tried keeping myself awake for as long as I thought he’d continue to hold me but he didn’t let go. His strength didn’t falter. I began to panic as I realized how little oxygen was spared within me. My eyes weakly rolled up into my head, I tried stopping it every time. Until.. The string of consciousness slipped through my clammy hands.    
I know I wasn’t dead. Or at least, the reassurance of knowing I couldn’t die without them facing the punishment of Rei was desperately keeping me alive. Was it the belief that I was kind and didn’t want these two people to be punished by Rei? Even if they’ve done terrible things to me..? Or was I just finally gaining consciousness again?   
I must have been dreaming.

I woke up with my head at the foot of the bed, a strange position I have never slept in but it wasn’t so abnormal that it needed to alarm  me. I didn’t have too much time to dwell on it either, I had to tidy my room, tidy myself, and head downstairs to help the Nun with breakfast. 

Making my way down the stairs, something in me couldn’t stop making me hope for at least one act of kindness for this special day of mine. No, I knew better.   
It did bum me out, that was inevitable for my developing mind. For those insignificant things to matter so much for a developing mind but for a developed mind, it is.. Insignificant. Just as insignificant you are to them.   
So this is what it’s like when you are simply a hollow vessel for others to control and use.. It didn’t feel new. Not even this level of insignificance and worthlessness was new to me.   
To be honest, even that.. I would’ve taken it as a gift.. If I hadn’t known about it already.

Well, the day had only just begun, right? I focused on the water boiling to make poached eggs. Carefully cracking the egg shells and letting the egg plop into the boiling water over the gas stove. I watched the water calm, assessing its new ingredient before allowing itself to continue boiling calmly. I had tilted my head while in a short trance, but I kicked into auto-pilot. Taking a ladle with holes to scoop out the softly cooked egg and rest it down on a plate. Fixing it toast with butter and a mug of black coffee. The Nun would serve it to the Judge.   
They hadn’t invited me to eat, so that meant I wasn’t going to eat.   
I was still in a slight trance as I tidied up the kitchen, grabbing the small pot of hot water that once boiled. Carefully moving to pour the water out in the sink that was only three steps away. I began to pour it out, hot steam sweetened my skin. Almost finished pouring it out until a body threw itself into my steady body. My hand with the pot wavered with the bump and push, the hot water would cover my other hand.   
I dropped the pot and quickly flicked the water faucet on, cold water rushing out and onto my burned hand. My actions to salvage my hand were quicker than my reaction to the searing pain. Tears welled up on my waterline as I shakily blew out as if to cool down the internal inferno I felt overcome my hand and arm. I knew I couldn’t make a commotion, that would only grant me more punishments.   
I closed my eyes tight shut, the tears breaking from my waterline and rolling down my hot cheeks. My other hand gripped on the faucet, continuing to let the cool water on my burning hand. 

When the Judge first arrived, I could never forget our first interaction. The way his eyes were in awe and his mouth slightly agape when we made eye contact. He had fallen to his knees and crawled all the way to me, bowing at my feet. I tried stepping just an inch away but he grabbed my ankles with his hands, his grip so tight it left bruises.   
He carefully peeked up at me from the side, having to tilt his head to the side and his eye shot up to meet mine.   
“*The end of times, you’ve finally come to me. How tender you are. This life has treated you well enough. Judgment has finally come to meet you at the mark, for I am,* **The Judge**.  
*Do not fear, I will mold you tenderly with my judging silence.*  
*You are doomed and I am judged.*” 

I had no idea what he meant by any of that, but I did quickly learn what, ’*I will mold you tenderly with my judging silence.*’, would mean for me.   
I could *feel* the judging silence come from him since I had made noise by throwing the pot into the sink. Causing a clatter. He didn’t like loud noises and whatever he didn’t like, earned a punishment. I couldn’t even swallow, my throat was so tight, it could probably cease air.   
I simultaneously noticed how long I had the water faucet going that I already knew it must’ve agitated him. I would hear him scoot out the chair, away from the table. I could barely see him from the corner of my eye. The depressurization and pressurization of my lungs could be felt tenfold on my chest. It felt tight, then it felt hollow. Even despite its steady rhythm, the intense depressurization and pressurization was so much that my head started to throb along with the rhythm of my heart. All these different sensations nearly caused a meltdown but I was much more terrified of the Judge.   
What was he going to do. 

I saw a hand move past my head before clasping over my mouth, the other hand grabbing both my hands. Gripping so tight, I knew it would create and leave bruises. “*You take water for granted, all for a minor burn*.”   
I hadn’t noticed the water filled up the sink, I was panicking severely over what the Judge would do to me that my brain completely forgot to send the command to my hands to close the faucet. It was too late.   
The Judge would move his hand away from over my mouth and hands but now grabbed a handful of my hair, forcing my face and head into the sink full of murky water. I didn’t know what utensils were in the water but the sharp slice on my cheekbone quickly let me know. The reaction to pain was back to normal now, I winced with a slight yelp causing me to choke as water now entered my windpipe without a consensual invitation. I felt the insides of my nose burn as well.   
I wanted to jerk back my head as I panicked but the Judge firmly held me in place. Before I could let out a scream, the Judge lifted my head out of the water. I sputtered out water and gasped for air as my lungs demanded its element for life. 

“*You cannot tend to your burn or cut, you will finish cleaning instead.*” The Judge let go of my hair with a push, walking away with a numbing calmness as he took each step away from me. I hated it. My hands clenched into fists against the white tile of the kitchen counter. I stared into the murky water that filled the sink. Not even my blood was significant enough to stain the water. I nearly dissociated but quickly snapped myself out of the trance again.   
I endured the pain of my blistering hand along with the cut on my cheekbone. I would wash the dishes, put away any other produce and seasonings, wipe off the counters with a rag, sweep, and mop. My chores didn’t end there.  
There was laundry to do, sweep, mop, dust the other rooms and spaces of the orphanage as well as the small church that was outside. 

It was afternoon, nearing evening when I finished sweeping, mopping, and dusting the entire orphanage. I would carry my broom, mop and bucket, and feather duster. Approaching the small church, watching the cross that stood on top of the spire. A red cross.   
Finally inside, I didn’t waste time. Taking the duster and dusting off furniture and objects. Careful with the statue of a woman with horns.. And a small ball of stone between the ends of her horns.   
Then I took my broom and swept. Done with that and I took the mop and bucket, careful not to spill any water; even if I could just mop it up.   
While I mopped around the statue of the woman, I got the strong feeling I was being watched. My eyes lifted up from the glossy floor before my chin listed itself to allow my eyes to scan freely around the empty church. There was no one. Just me and this statue. I blinked and looked over at the statue. My eyes went further up until it reached the ceiling, I noticed how the spire and cross were directly above the statue. I found it an interesting design of structure. Nothing more.

Until I saw a liquid pool at the top of the spire, how was that even possible? The spire wasn’t upside down to be able to hold liquid, it was upright so the liquid would naturally just spill. But this liquid just sloshed above, I watched with a slight curl to my lip. It was almost gross. The liquid was thick.   
I closed my eyes, maybe I was seeing things. It was still there.   
I put my hand over my eyes. Uncovering them and the second I blinked, it was as if the pool of liquid was interrupted by a small ripple. A drop of the liquid fell down.   
I stepped back swiftly, falling from the small step that divided the church floor and the slate of stone that was the base of the statue.  
I had shattered a glass vase with red spider lilies. I sat in the small spill of water from the flowers, glass everywhere, and the spider lilies all around me too.   
I began to fret immediately at the mess I made, picking myself up onto my feet to grab the broom and sweep everything up but as my eyes looked around for the broom. That was when I noticed it.   
The statue. Its horns and head were covered in red. The red liquid streamed down ever so slowly down the rest of the statue. Nothing of the strangeness made me nervous or outraged, I was more anxious about the mess of everything and the punishment I’d get. My face felt dread.   
‘\**Dammit… Think your way out of this one.. Fix it, hurry.\**’  
I jolted into action, grabbing the broom and sweeping up all the glass and flowers. Leaving it in a pile while I went to throw out some of the water from the bucket and returned to pick up the glass and drop it in the water. Its clatter subdued with the water. The flowers would simply float. I mopped up the spill of water and before I would raise the mop up to the statue’s head, the entrance to the church creaked open. \**No..!*\* I froze. I knew it was the Judge. That silence that permeated every space of anywhere he was at, it wasn’t forgettable. It couldn’t be dismissed. It couldn't be mistaken. 

My eyes looked over to him. His hands had been dropped to his sides, his eyes wide in awe and his mouth slightly agape. Like the first time we met. 

This time, I spoke up first. “I didn’t know what to do.. It just happened by itsel-”   
“*You may leave.*” I couldn’t tell if I was truly relieved or even more petrified with that one command. I didn’t waste time to pick everything up even if I nearly tripped over myself a few times. I shut the door carefully behind me once I was out the dark space that was meant for worship and holiness. 

I stared at the door until I began to take a few steps backwards, slowly lifting my gaze and chin to look at the cross on top of the spire. It was blood red. \**I really didn’t imagine it all…*\* There was no relief to that acknowledgement. Instead, I felt… nauseous and.. Anxious like I knew something bad was coming—But I had no idea what. 

“*Child!*” I jumped at the scream for me, it was the Nun at the entrance of the house. The spike of blood rushing to my heart settled down and I began to make my way across the small clearing to get to the orphanage. Before I entered the house, the Nun watched me. I couldn’t meet her glare. “*You broke something didn’t you?*“ “Yes.. By accident, something strange happened in there.. The Judge said to just leave.”   
A hand struck my cheek.   
“*You are given the simple task of cleaning these areas and you still somehow make a mess. You good for nothing ill-mannered child.*” The Nun nearly spat at me, her tongue laced with venom as she spoke down at me. It was frustrating to me because she wasn’t always like this.   
I guess, the distant memory of her being kind to me is what causes me confusion and frustration when she treats me like this now. It's frustrating not knowing why she’s like this now, where it came from, and how… — How can I get her to be kind to me again. 

With the slap, my head faced my right shoulder with my hair hiding my eye and nose. I grit my teeth, straightened my head and flicked my head slightly to get my hair out of my face.   
I trailed quietly behind her, immediately making my way to the basement where laundry was done and the rest of my cleaning equipment was kept. 

When I opened the door that led down to the basement, I could instantly hear the sound of water. I quickly rushed down the stairs and finally saw the source of the sound. The sink was overflowing with water. I dropped everything I had in my hands with a clatter to rush into the wet puddle around the sink, turning off the water. I could feel the water soak my shoes already.   
I stared at the sink filled to the brim with water, I could see a slight reflection.  
I could see the small cut on my cheek. I didn’t stare at it too long, I would look away towards the wall on my left and exhale. Dipping a hand into the water to pull out whatever was stopping the water to drain. My fingers felt something round and smooth. It was metal. I grabbed it out, pulling it out of the water. The water was finally able to drain, causing a little whirlpool.   
I looked at what was in my hand. Rei’s.. Compass. I slightly shook it to get the water off of it but then I reached over to grab a towel. I took a step, stepping on the washing board and slid backwards. I was in the air for a split second. A small \*’splash’\* was caused by my body hitting the concrete floor. Not even registering the tough and dull pain that slowly took over my ribs, back, and elbows. I just stared at the wooden ceiling which was upstairs from the basement. I could see the slight dust that came off the wooden planks as the Nun walked by. I saw the light leave my eyes and return.   
I had begun to realize that all day was just a series of misfortunes. I felt how my face contorted. My brows furrowed, my nose twitched and my lip slightly curled. I shot my arm up, my fist clenching the compass. I held the temptation to throw it across the basement, or smash it in my fist, or throw it to the ground and smash it in with my shoe. I held back so bad because it was the only physical thing that Rei left me with.   
He said: “*Kali, whenever and wherever you need me.. Point this compass to Polaris and I’ll come back to you. I promise*.” *\*’Liar.’\** A voice in the back of my mind spoke for me. My true feelings began to seep out of the bottle. I closed my eyes shut, only to open them with tears overflowing. Running down my temples and into my ears. It was a strange sensation having my hot ears wet with warm tears. “*Liar…*” My voice croaked out. But there was a desperation in my voice, I wanted to be proven wrong. I wanted all these sad thoughts to be proven wrong, all these angry feelings to be proven wrong, all these painful times without Rei to be worth something.   
I found my hand pointing the compass towards the direction of which Polaris would be in the night sky. I had memorized its exact location. So many times I wanted to be proven wrong… So many times I still had hope in him.  
I let my arm fall with another slight *‘splash’*, my wrist and elbow smacked the concrete. I laid there for another minute before I finally began to pick myself up, leaving the cold water that actually felt nice against my hot body. Maybe I’d get sick and I could stay in bed all day. That sounded nice. Being sick could be a distraction.   
I’d shake my head, having to shake away these lazy thoughts and put myself back into motion.  
Lifting the compass over my head and allowing it to hang around my neck, I’d hide it underneath my dress. 

Stepping carefully away from the puddle and sink to grab a broom and begin to sweep away the water towards a drain that was in the middle of the basement. Setting the broom aside and beginning to unclip dried clothes from the clothing line made of thin rope, folding the clothes and washing more with the wooden washing board. My knuckles were aching by the time I finished. My fingerprints wrinkly, soon to dry.   
Even if I had finished, I could help but feel… restless. There was something missing. Perhaps I missed a step in my routine so I went over the day in my head. Blocking out the strange sightings in the small chapel. There was nothing amiss. I had done everything in order.   
I let out a sigh and decided to take some time to wind down, I knew I couldn’t go on with my chores like this. If I had a sliver of bad attitude, I’d get immediately punished. 

I sat in front of a brick wall; And stared at the brick wall. This was a punishment given to me but I actually found it quite benefitting. I was able to collect my mind and bring it to peace.   
But, this restless feeling still didn’t dissipate. It was lingering just over my head. Breathing against my nape. Slipping under my skin. Squeezing itself into my veins. Oozing into my blood. Finding its way into my heart. 

No matter how many times I readjusted myself, or stopped myself from touching just about anything so I didn’t overstimulate myself, or moved my damp hair from the neck or back or shoulder, or tilted my neck downwards, upwards, to the side. Nothing felt right. Everything and anything fueled this restless feeling.   
Finally, I’d furrow my brows, wrap my arms around my legs and stare into a crack in the wall.   
I could see a white ball of light within the darkness of the crack, I blinked so it’d go away. I tended to hallucinate when I stared for too long. However, the white ball of light didn’t leave the darkness of the crack in the wall. I carefully inched closer, realizing the white ball of light was the moon and there were stars. The moon looked exactly like last night’s moon. A half moon.   
I inched closer now, seeing the outline of my window.   
My fingers gripped into the edges of the crack, wanting to widen the crack. My nails chipped away at how hard I desperately wanted to widen this crack in the wall. I wanted to *see*.   
The moon, the stars, and the window began to move but in the motion of weak thrusts. I shed a tear, I lost my voice.   
This unsourced force that beckoned me to widen this crack and *see* was overpowering every sense I had. I hadn’t realized I broke skin and began to bleed from my fingertips. I clawed and clawed at this crack, I needed to *see*.   
However, ’*seeing’* wasn’t ’*knowing*’. 

Suddenly, the crack showed half of the Judge’s face before returning to pitch black. My foot pushed my body back and I muted my own scream with my bloodied hands. My body trembled, causing the tears from my eyes to tremble before it rolled down my hot skin.   
I managed to slowly pick myself up, still daring to approach the wall again. Still daring to stare at it again.   
Gradually, I could begin to feel aches on my hips, my legs turned into clotted blood, and my chest felt like it was going to burst open.   
Desperately, to not feel these very unwanted and foreign sensations, I frantically dusted off my body with my stinging hands.   
“*No.. No… Get..off..*” I muttered under my breath the demands I couldn’t say last night.   
I shook my head violently before slamming the side of my clenched fist against the wall in front of me. Before my fist straightened itself and drove itself right into the hard wall, it hurt and hurt even more than the last throw but I couldn’t stop. I wanted the pain around my hips, legs and chest to go away. I wanted to feel something else other than those unwanted sensations. This pain on my knuckles and hands sufficed.   
Until my hands went numb. I still trembled when I stopped my punches and took a look at why I couldn’t feel any more pain. I saw my bone through the layers of tears, skin and meat.   
I had finally reached the spot in my bones that itched so much. 

With that, realization impaled me like a hundred spikes and spears. Daggers and swords couldn’t reach the high I was on.   
I stared a little while longer. Watching a droplet of blood roll off my stained skin and slow motioned its fall to the concrete floor.   
Four of my other senses returned, I could hear hurried steps towards the entrance to the basement. *\*’They heard me.’\**   
All other feelings I felt were washed away with the blood I shed and dread introduced itself back into the play. An old friend.   
I rushed to immediately clean up any evidence there was of a violent outbreak of my emotions.   
It was too late. The Judge was already at the foot of the stairs, staring at me as I tried smearing off the blood on the wall with a wet rag.   
I could feel his searing glare that quite literally branded the seal on my nape, I froze.   
The atmosphere was instantly heavy with disgust and horror, emanating from the Judge. I could tell… *\*’I scare him.’\**   
However, his approach to this horror in front of him was certainly abnormal from any other person witnessing horror. He charged towards me, taking a handful of my hair and dropping me to my knees. They scraped.   
“*You have crossed over. Your seal must be burned into you once more.*” I could see the horror in his eyes now. Despite being threatened for torture, I felt a shift in me, or was there finally a shift in superiority now? The Judge felt afraid. I would feel pain. But that didn’t mean I was weak.  
I was ***angry***. 

I tried jerking forward to make the Judge struggle keeping a good grip but he tugged, causing a cracked yelp to escape my dry throat. I was dragged up the stairs by my hair, my scalp was on fire.   
Before we reached the door that led outside, I continued to kick around. Finally grabbing the Judge’s ankle and biting it. Nearly biting off a chunk of unholy meat but before I committed myself to the gorey act, he kicked at my nose. A broken crack appeared vertically across my nose. While my nostrils slowly dripped a slightly darker shade of blood red. I didn’t dwell on the almost unbearable pain but instead took the chance to ground my heels into the floor and run out the door.   
I fell to my knees again when I crossed through the doorway and now I was outside, it was dusk. The sky seemed to be on fire with its red, red orange, and hot pink hues painted across the sky.   
I looked up at it in awe before I was kicked in the back, it knocked the wind out of me. I heaved inwards but couldn’t release any exhales. I realized it was futile to regain my breath back so I crawled away from, who I assumed, was the Judge that kicked me. My already scraped knees would sting against the dry dirt as I forced my convulsing body to move further away to buy me some time while I regained my breath.   
I moved towards a shed where I knew there was going to be an axe or machete. I was able to open the door while I coughed, gasping less for air. Still unable to get on my feet until like lightning striking down to earth, a whip crackled just 15 feet from where I was.   
The scars on my back could reopen just with that sound. “*Ha….-*” I breathed, my back against the shed’s wall but I wasn’t inside. My right arm was still searching blindly for the axe as I watched the Judge approach me with the whip in his hand. His glare persistent as ever.   
I finally felt a barrel and my hand climbed up the barrel to grab a hold of the axe’s handle. I’d get to my feet now with a slight limp, swallowing vomit as I now held the axe firmly in my grasp and right in front of me. I ran to the side as the Judge reeled back his arm with the whip before letting it crackle again, I stopped once it hit the ground and flicked up into the air. I reeled back my own hand and arm, propelling the axe into the air and falling dead on the whip. Stabbing it into the ground. Stopping its reign in my mind, the torture on my body, and the power of the Judge.   
The Judge and I watched as I succeeded to put interlude to the abuse until we exchanged glances. We both knew I was going for the axe again. I lunged forward.   
But it wasn’t any good, I was too far. The Judge was closer. Still I had blind hope that I’d reach the axe in time and swing it through the Judge’s neck. My arm, my hand, my fingers reached out to grab the axe’s handle again but I was tackled by the Judge. We hit the ground and I immediately tried setting distance between us again but I was too entangled with his body that I couldn’t find a way out. He had kicked me in the stomach, followed by a throat grab. Using me to steady himself and get on his feet. I was on my knees again. He’d release my throat and strike his fist into my face. I saw it nearly in slow motion, the acceptance of failure and helplessness flashed at me. It mocked me.  
The Judge never struck me in the face like the Nun did.   
My nose dripped more blood and my head went back before rolling over to hang down. 

The last thing I would feel was the Judge’s wet hand with my blood smack into my nape to drag me back but I was still. My red hair covered my entire face.   
Covering the way my eyes rolled into my head.   
Something was broken.   
Not just my nose, or a rib, or a cheekbone.   
I was certainly broken.   
But there was something much more deeper that had to be sealed away and never broken into light.   
The seal was broken.   
“So..? How do you do it?”   
“*It's all in your head.*”  
“Are you calling yourself crazy?”  
“*No.. Well- maybe a little- Okay, let me try again- So.. You know how the heart works right? Blood goes through it and that's how it keeps going ‘bum bum’. But.. Do you know why you feel so bad when we have to kill animals to eat? Why it tears at your heart?*""   
""No.. not really..""   
""*Right, So- That same mystery is present in our mind. There's a very silly thing called* *consciousness**. It's the voice in your head that's always going to be true. For example, I can wave a fish in your face and you lie, saying you aren't hungry but deep down you know that you are hungry. Very hungry. Same thing when you know something is bad and wrong, maybe you're doing the bad thing, deep down you know it's bad and you shouldn't do it. It's like being honest with yourself all the time. The constant reminder of who you are.*   
*Now.. There are some people that will lock away their own consciousness and ignore it. I can't do that. My consciousness isn't just one voice anymore.*   
*How that came to be... Well, I listened to the first voice, I listened closely and it showed me everything I can do now. It showed me different versions of myself and beyond that.*   
*Your consciousness will guide you to whatever your purpose is.*   
*The known.. The unknown..  The truth..*   
*Don't be scared, Kali... because, from what I learned, all of it is a part of you.*   
*Even the scary parts.*   
*There is no coming to consciousness without pain.*”   
The voices echoed all around me like this memory was chosen for me right for this moment in time. I remembered this memory, so it was no longer just voices. I remembered that night, we watched the meteor showers on top of a hill. It wasn’t even cold. It weighs on me because it was also the last conversation I had with Rei. The last *real* conversation I had with him. 

I open my eyes to finish the memory, it would reminisce in my head and heart for a while longer either way. Just as this new memory would etch itself into my life and reveal its purpose to me.   
My purpose. My consciousness. 

This huge chaos beast, made of the hazy-looking but red hue of hair. Four legs, an attached tail, and horns that curved backwards; holding a glowing sphere of red with vertical rings between them.   
This must be the greeter for the afterlife. “This is the end..” I muttered out with a strained swallow. Only for the chaos beast to look over and retaliate: “***The beginning.***”  
The beast was so huge I hadn’t realized we were in a pocket of space, I looked around as I saw the distant galaxies and milky ways. I stupidly searched for Polaris. My head whipped around making straight eye contact with the chaos beast. Its blind eyes sunk into mine. A ring of white now glinted around my iris. I finally understood. This chaos beast.. Is *me*.   
This is my consciousness.   
The strange force that beckoned to me to connect with it. The missing piece to my mind.   
  
The beast inched closer to feignedly grant me my true desire. “***What do you want, Kali?***“ Its voice was distorted, nearly cutting my ear drums to a burst as its rise of voice were like multiple screams until its speech was coherent. I winced but I didn’t take my eyes off of it.   
“I want to see Rei. I want my brother back.” I said firmly. That was really all I wanted.   
“***He is dangerous. He tried killing us. Killing you.***”   
My single, weak being was struck with disbelief. Rei would never think, let alone, do such a thing. My mind was silent. I looked down to the foggy ground underneath both of us.   
I considered its reality, its possibility.   
“Rei always had a good reason for those heavy counts.” I defended my brother, I believed in him.   
“***Naive and stupid are we?***“  
’*We*’ had never felt so heavy before. I could remember the way the Nun mocked me but when the chaos beast said it. It felt like an insult, disrespect, and arrogance. Not just towards it.. but myself.   
I was shut up just like that.  
The beast continued: “***Through all of time, since the very first of us, we are born as every female child. Until pain awakens us and the chaos ensues. Time.. and time.. And time again.***”  
The chaos beast had made me see the generational, universal, inevitable pain and horror that was subjected to every version of me. Flames engulfed my body, daggers pierced my body, spears impaled me, my neck sliced off, every brutal way of dying or torture. And it didn’t stop there, no.. mental abuse, emotional. I saw it all. I knew it all. I lived through it all.   
“***Until, you were born, Kali. You were not born alone. You have a twin brother. You are an anomaly to our cycle of life and purpose. We do not know if you will be a threat to us or the final piece. From the looks of it, this life is done being tender to you.***” My mouth was slightly agape. My eyes were wide, allowing a single tear to run down my cheek. My face was frozen in horror. As the chaos beast explained, it had showed me what happened the night of my 16th birthday. I finally *knew* my personal cataclysm. 

“***Chaos was always here. Before you were, chaos waited for you. The ultimate trade awaited its ultimate practitioner.***” 

So it was inescapable. Chaos was going to consume me anyways. What did it matter anyways then.   
The word, ‘consume’, echoed in my crowded mind.   
Rei was trying to save me from myself. That’s why he tried killing the chaos beast. In other words, ’*me*’. 

I choked before words formed correctly out of me. “I want to see Rei.” I demanded again.   
I could feel the beast stare into me before obliging. A sphere of glowing red appeared in front of me before it stretched and Rei appeared in a hexagon-shaped cell, frozen in time and unconsciousness but I knew he wasn’t dead.   
I studied his face. A slight smile was brought to my face as it looked like he was at rest. I’d carefully reach out to press my hand against the hexagon cell. My hand didn’t go through.   
It didn’t have too. I knew my words would reach him. “You can’t save me from myself, Rei..” My tone was a mixture of pain, gratitude, solace, yet… *rage*. The perfect ingredients for chaos. 

I shared one more glance with the chaos beast before I closed my eyes, inhaling to replace life into my physical body. 

I woke up. My senses returning to my alive body and mind. I could hear the Judge yell out prayers at me. I lifted my head, curtaining away my hair from my face to place a hand over my face. My index finger and little finger separated from the two fingers in the middle. My left eye glinted just seconds before the Judge’s body was levitated into the air and ripped into two pieces by an unseen force.   
The two pieces of flesh and meat slapped onto the dry dirt floor, soaking it in blood now. 

My breathing quickened with each coming and going exhale and inhale, I gently fell forward. My forehead thumped softly against the ground, my arms and hands were pressed against my chest.   
A scream brewed in my lungs, my chest, rising to my throat until it finally released. It was so raw a drop of saliva fell onto the dry ground. The earth didn’t absorb it.   
It was too busy comprehending what was happening as the orphanage was being ripped from its foundation, caving in on itself, until perishing with a flash of bright red.   
The screams of the Nun echoed throughout the area. 

My body was slowly being picked up by an unseen force now. My legs left the ground, my arms lifted, my head rolled, my hair draped over my head and shoulders. Clouds were gathered around me as I levitated further and further up. Hovering over the center of the mountains and forest.   
A searing pain was felt on my back, my scars detached themselves from my body. These unperfect slashes glowed red above me before striking through me, every single scar on my body impaling me. I had been sabotaged. I was *doomed*.   
Lightning struck red. The clouds turned red. The forest was on fire. 

This place would forever be known as the ”***The Madra Storm***”.

A chaos that could run itself, no need to tend it.

I know it might be selfish but I don’t care. I would do it in a heart beat. I would go back and beg you to stay and make sure you didn’t leave me this soon.

I came across it recently and realized how wrong I was not to believe. Herb Simon (god bless) refused to tank, Kevin Pritchard did his magic, Rick and Hali created a revolution, Obi and Pascal wanted in..the rest is history. Even with Haliburton sidelined, we have an incredible, exciting team that I couldn’t have dreamed of 4 years ago.

I’m devastated but I wouldn’t trade any of this to back to 2021. I will try not to despair because our future is still very bright. ",14,1750826656.0,pacers,0,1.0,False

1ljwdw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParentingADHD/comments/1ljwdw9/the_wait_for_help_is_destroying_me/,The wait for help is destroying me,"My 8 year old daughter had ADHD and anxiety, and it is threatening to destroy me. I guess there are two parts to this: 1) the behavioral struggles associated with this dual diagnosis, and 2) the wait for help when you’re already desperate. 

The sleep troubles are just endless. Tomorrow is her last day of third grade, and on nights like this we sometimes give her Benadryl to help her sleep. Not even a once a week thing, and we’ve been to the pediatrician and gotten no help. Tonight I put my toddler to bed, then went right into the bedtime routine with the 8 year old. My husband was working until 10pm, so he wasn’t home. The whole time I do bedtime with the 2 year old she is an anxious wreck, she can’t even stand calmly in the hallway immediately outside the door. I have to threaten her with consequences to get her to leave the room. My 2 year old deserves her own calm time with mommy before bed, and a quiet, peaceful bedtime. It is only about 5 minutes, and the 8 year old can’t do it. She often comes in the room crying or whining. Tonight, even on Benadryl, she is still not asleep. I can’t leave her room until she’s asleep, but she’s been falling lightly asleep, then waking herself up to check for me. Cue the whining, attempting to get out of bed, I can’t take it any more. It was 11pm when I finally left her bedroom… and 20 minutes later she was downstairs, loudly whining, while I finally tried to do the dishes. I’ve tried being super supportive, stopping what I’m doing, having a snuggle, reassuring her she is safe, she can relax and go to sleep, I’m not going anywhere, etc., but I’m at my limit. I can’t do that when it’s already 11:30 and the lunch boxes aren’t washed yet! She wakes herself up every day anxious and ready to go somewhere around 6am. This is nowhere near enough sleep for either of us. 

We are pursuing medication, hoping to start with guanfacine, at our next appointment, but that isn’t until July 30th. Our sleep study, scheduled months ago, was booked for the earliest available appointment… Sept. 2nd. Out of desperation I took her to the pediatrician last week to see if there was anything they can do in the meantime. They recommended I follow up with her psychiatrist to see if we can get in any sooner. Spoiler alert: we cannot. We’re on a cancellation list. (We live in America, if that matters while reading this). 

I am so beyond tired. I teach severe special ed for HS students and if I show up this tired it is dangerous. It’s not even safe to drive to work at this point. No amount of coffee can save me. At least there’s only two days left for my school year. 

Questions: 

What can we do in the meantime? I am often solo parenting at night, so baths are out bc she’s too young to be in there on her own while I do bedtime for the little one, and she won’t stay in there on her own anyway, let’s be real. Melatonin doesn’t work. Magnesium doesn’t work. No screens somehow seems to make it worse, bc she would use them as a distraction from her anxiety while I did other kid bedtime and would not escalate as much. 

Any ideas on how to get into the doctor sooner? Someone recommended trying to find a neurologist instead of a psychiatrist as there typically aren’t wait times. The neurologist I contacted when she was being diagnosed said insurance requires a psychiatrist for diagnosis and will not approve a neurologist for those services. Can you see both a neurologist and a psychiatrist? Do they work on different aspects of the ADHD and/or anxiety?

Any other advice or solidarity is welcome. 

I’m ADHD/anxiety myself, but not as severe for either.",2,1750825559.0,ParentingADHD,4,0.75,False

He was in his mid 20s and I was 19.  We talked on grindr and were vibing really well.  Like talking consistently with each other non-sexually for 30 minutes.  I finally drove to he's duplex after 2 days of chatting and the sex was amazing.  It was romantic, animalistic, and we had done many kinks (such as bareback, freeuse, and cnc with a buddy of his).  

Anyways, two weeks went by and he started to get progressively more angrier with his neighbors.  The one time that made me go ""fuck this"" was when I parked a little too close to his neighbors driveway one night and she POLITEY asked him if the ""boy coming over"" (me) could move his car up a little more next time cause she almost hit it that morning.  Well he threw he's phone at the ground and punched a hole in he's wall, which scared the shit out of me cause he did it in the direction of the guy that has the other half of a duplex.  Lucky the hole didn't go all the way through, but it sure did scared me.

So I stayed there for the night and left once he fell asleep cause I was scared he might hit me cause he was, quite frankly, dealing with a lot of mental problems that made me think he had bipolar.  We were suppose to meet up 2 days after but I talked to him that I felt unsafe the last time I went over.  He than told me he was going to unalive himself (his words not mine) if I didn't come over.  I never hit the block button so fast in my life.

Than fast forward to 4-5 months later, I was getting some Starbucks in my college town and guess who was there asking for my form of payment in the drive thru.  Yep! It was him.  He seemed better, but boy was I wrong.  So he apparently he got a new phone during that 4-5 month period and created a new grindr account.  He found me that night and started accusing me of being a horrible person and told me he spat in my coffee just to make it special for me.  So I block him yet again and called for a wellness check on him cause I still had his address.  I wasn't worried he was going to find me cause I transfer to a different college a few towns over. 

Still wish he wasn't dealing with a bunch of anger issues, cause that was the best sex I ever had, both romantically and sexualy; but than I remind myself of why I left. That's it, hopefully, for now!",1,1750825524.0,GrindrStories,0,1.0,False

*The camp stuck out like a wound upon the land. A rotted set of tent poles, bivouac long since collapsed, a rusted pot. It had almost been consumed by the marsh.

*My eyes barely caught it.*

*Sitting on a lichen-crusted rock.*

*I’m posting this here in case the wind finds me, too.*

**Journal of Baptiste M.**

**Yukon River, Western AlaskaWinter, 1904**

I don't know if anyone will ever read this. Maybe the snow’ll swallow it, maybe the wind’ll scatter the pages. Or maybe whatever’s out there now, wearing Charlie’s skin like a damp coat, will find it first. But I need to write. Put something between me and the silence. Make a record, for whoever comes after—if anyone does.

My name is Baptiste. Born in Buffalo Narrows, Saskatchewan. My maman was Métis—Cree blood, strong and soft-spoken. My père was French and loud, but never mean. He taught me to trap, hunt, live close to the land. I grew up skinning muskrats with a pocketknife and listening to fiddle tunes by candlelight. I was a child of the prairie, floating through life like logs on the Qu'Appelle river. I left home when I was seventeen, drifted north like smoke from a cabin chimney. I thought I was chasing gold. Maybe I was just chasing quiet.

I came to Alaska by raft, sled, and frozen boot-leather. Bummed rides from trappers, gold panners, ex-confederates looking to escape the long arm of Uncle Sam. I once met a missionary fella, small man, going to proselytize among the peoples of the great heathen North. Traveled the Yukon until the world narrowed to cold air, pine smoke, and the smell of my own wool coat. I liked it that way. No one cared who I was up there. I was just another lost soul hoping to find, or lose, himself under that big white Alaskan sun. Ended up in Eagle late in the season, the only beacon of civilization, if you can even call it that, for miles until that trading settlement up on the Tanana. It was already cold, snow crusting the edges of the trail, dogs breathing steam like little engines. The kind of cold that bites your teeth and settles into your bones like regret. 

I was raised Catholic, like most Métis. I was proud of my God, but the further I came north it seemed he mattered less and less. Eagle was no exception. A small cluster of cabins with a single dirt trail through the center. As I walked into town, passing a few straggling natives hauling tump-lines of pelts to the factor’s house, I saw it. Burned remnants, a single blackened cross the only betrayal of what this charred hulk once was. I turned to a man walking past, an old man, scars on his face and hair poking out from under what looked to be an old army cap. I tried, in French, to ask him why the few inhabitants hadn’t rebuilt God's house. He stared at me like I was from a different world. Then he simply said, “Dieu n’a pas de demeure ici.” God has no home here. 

I was in the post office-slash-supply store—rough-cut logs, frost etching patterns on the windows, woodstove in the corner throwing off more smoke than heat. A tattered flag adorned the wall behind the counter; whether taken as a trophy or displayed out of actual reverence, I couldn’t tell. The few patrons huddled near the woodstove, speaking in a mix of French, Russian, and a multitude of other languages that I couldn’t pinpoint. I sat in the back, nursing a split knuckle from a mishap with the axe and drinking thick coffee that tasted like charred rope. In strode this Gwich’in man. Big shoulders, sharp eyes. Dressed in a caribou hide parka that looked like it had been made by a blind seamstress. His hair was short and black, I couldn’t tell his age. He could’ve been 40, or he could’ve just seen his 19th winter.

He looked around once, eyes flashing to the fire, then to the people conversing like ravens on a carcass. Looked at me. Then walked over and sat across from me like it’d already been decided somewhere upriver.

He didn’t say anything. Just reached out, tapped the knuckles of my bandaged hand, then tapped his chest twice. I figured that meant his name. I said “Baptiste.” He nodded once, just once, like he was filing it away in some drawer in his head. He tapped his chest again. I shrugged. “Charlie,” I said. Figured he needed a name I could pronounce. He never told me different.

After a few more swigs of coffee, Charlie simply stood up and walked out. I assumed I should follow him, follow this man whose face looked like rawhide stretched over stone. He led me out back, past the store's wood supply and to what looked to be a pile of gear under a caribou hide. He looked at me, and his eyes glinted with what I could only assume was pride. It was really the only emotion I could glean from his straight-across grin. He pulled back the hide to reveal a set of snares, a tent with a HBC brand, and a pair of snowshoes. 

I looked at him, wondered what he had done to come into such a fortune. “Where did you get this?” I quizzed him. He only looked at me, eyes hinting at something that I couldn’t see. 

We left Eagle two days later, with the last barge gone and the snow piling deeper.  Headed upriver with two rifles, enough provisions to last a few weeks, and a general enthusiasm for the grand possibility. The sun beat on our backs as we walked, shadows trudging along under us, our only companions except the cold. The cold was constant. The cold was hungry. It was the kind of cold where trees groan in the night and the river talks in its sleep.

We built our camp on a bend in the Yukon where the spruce trees leaned like old men. Good hunting ground. Quiet. Nobody for miles but the ravens. 

Life was good, at first. We worked in rhythm. Wake up to frost on the blankets, breath like smoke in the cold. One of us would stoke the fire while the other boiled snow for water. Breakfast was usually pemmican or bannock, sometimes fresh rabbit or ptarmigan if we were lucky. Charlie made tea with spruce needles. Tasted like biting a tree, but it kept you sharp.

Charlie was certainly curious, multiple times I caught him opening my bible, staring at the lines of ink which I knew meant less than moose tracks through the snow to him. But nevertheless he looked, studied it with the same glint in his eyes as when we first met. 

We trapped in a wide loop down by the oxbow, mostly for fox and hare. Once we caught a lynx, and Charlie let out the first laugh I ever heard from him—a low, surprised sound like he hadn’t remembered he could. I smoked the meat, stretched the pelt. We talked without talking. Gestures. Shared chores. Some days we didn’t speak at all, but it never felt quiet.

The forest was quiet, but not dead. The trees were alive, they groaned and swayed like old women. Tracks of small animals crisscrossed the snow every morning. One morning I awoke to find a set of wolverine tracks that came right to our tent, then retreated back into the snowy wild. 

I’d spend afternoons sharpening my knife with the whetstone my grandfather gave me. Charlie would whittle, dozens of small wooden men began to populate our camp. He would leave them all around, in a rough semicircle around our camp, always facing north. We kept the fire going all day long once the cold settled in—colder than anything I’d known back in Saskatchewan. Even the river sounded different. Groaned and popped like it was alive beneath the ice.

Saw bear tracks once, big ones. Fresh. Too fresh. Charlie squatted down and stared at them a long time. When I asked if it was a grizzly, he just shook his head once, real slow. Didn’t say more.

One morning a moose wandered near the camp, steam rising from its back like smoke from a sweat lodge. We both froze, watching. Charlie raised his rifle and brought it down with one shot to the neck. It kicked twice before it lay still in the snow. Clean. Beautiful. Charlie cut a set of birch poles at the kill site, then lashed them into a travois before he began splitting its belly and peeling its skin back. I helped, the skin ripping away from the flesh like the bark off a birch tree. We chopped the carcass into quarters, leaving the gut pile for the wolves and ravens. We hauled it in together, sweating through our coats. Took all day to cut it proper, hang the meat over a low fire which creaked and popped like the joints of an old man. We thanked the spirit, me in my tongue, him in his. That night we ate like kings, fat sizzling on the fire, grease running down our chins, hands raw from the cold and the knives. 

Sometimes, after supper, we’d sit by the fire and watch the northern lights. They danced across the sky like stories, like ancestors telling secrets. Charlie’d hum low under his breath—something old, something I didn’t know but felt in my bones. I liked those nights. Felt like we were part of something older than the trees.

I started to remember the old stories. The stories I listened to from the loft where my brothers and I slept. Stories told away from the prying ears of the priests and the white men. Stories of the ancestors, the people who brought our people out from the dawnland and fought the old Buffalo-beings. I started to see that here, the Catholic God had no power. I began to pray to something older, something more… natural. This was older than Jesus, Mother Mary, or any of that. 

But then the snow came heavier. Days got shorter. The forest got quieter.

And Charlie started watching the trees too much.

Then, one morning, he didn’t come back.

I figured he’d gone farther than usual, past our unspoken perimeter about four miles out from camp. Maybe tracked something, maybe he saw a bear or wolverine and decided to follow. I waited. Drank half a mug of coffee and left his mug sitting on a flat rock near the fire, steam curling up and vanishing in the cold air. By dusk, the cup was frozen solid. I decided to put on my snowshoes and follow his track through the snow. I followed as far as I could. It simply went straight through the trees, walking with purpose, almost as if he was following something out there. But the snow had started falling by then, slow at first, then harder, until the trail vanished under the storm. 

And the storm didn’t stop. Not that night. Not the next. It screamed.

The wind howled like a dying thing. The trees shook so hard it felt like the earth might snap open and swallow us whole. I burned half our firewood just trying to keep my fingers alive. I ate every last scrap of food that we had. The tent groaned under the weight of snow, and I had to go out multiple times, wrapped in hides and blankets to shovel snow off of it with my snowshoes. I barely slept—just sat up with the rifle across my lap, staring at the shadows like they might blink first.

I kept thinking I heard him. Crunch of snow, a voice in the wind, maybe a knock on the edge of the tent pole. Every time I’d throw open the flap, there’d be nothing but darkness and snow.

Then he came back. Two days later, just after dusk. The snow had just stopped falling, the wind blustering like the death throes of a dying buffalo bull. 

No sound. No warning. Just walked into camp like he’d never left. He was covered in snow but not cold, not shivering. I saw a glimpse of his hand, black with frostbite, before he quickly shoved it into a fold in his coat.  His coat was ripped along the arm, blood crusted along the edge like old rust. He looked at me like he didn’t recognize me—or maybe like I was the one who’d changed.

I said his name. “Charlie.”

He didn’t speak. Didn’t blink. Just stared. His eyes were bloodshot, almost glazed over. I knew he could see me but I felt like he was looking past me, somewhere off into the trees. 

Something had followed him back from that blizzard.Something wearing him like a coat that didn’t fit quite right.

I tried to carry on like nothing was wrong. Chopped wood. Melted snow. Checked the snares. But everything felt *off*, like the world had tilted just a little and never tilted back. It felt like a temporary lull in a winterkill blizzard. Silent, no wind, a peace that eats at your brain until the howling winds are welcome.

Charlie barely ate. Didn’t sleep, far as I could tell. Just sat by the fire at night, still as stone, staring into the flames like they were telling him something. He didn’t hum anymore. He didn’t nod when I spoke his name.

He didn’t blink.

Sometimes I’d wake up in the dark, feel his eyes on me from across the tent. Just… *watching*. One time I pretended to sleep, let my breathing stay slow. He leaned close—so close I could feel his breath on my cheek. It didn’t smell like anything. Not meat, not smoke, not man. Just cold.

I remembered stories then. From when I was little, sitting by my *mémère’s* stove in Buffalo Narrows, the heat crackling and her hands busy with beadwork. She used to tell me things when the wind howled outside, when the dogs whined for no reason and the oil lamp flickered low.

“Baptiste,” she’d whisper, “don’t go out when the lights dance.”

I’d ask why, wide-eyed, chewing bannock too fast.

“Because the *Wîhtiko* hunts in the wind. Because the *napêwak*—the star-people—they call down to you. They don’t always bring you back.”

She told me of men who wandered from camp and came back wrong. Hollowed out. Hungry for more than food. Spirits that waited in snowdrifts and drank from your soul like it was birch sap.

I used to laugh at those stories. Say they were just to scare kids. But now?

Now I wasn’t laughing.

I started keeping my rifle close. Real close. Wouldn’t let Charlie walk behind me anymore. Wouldn’t sleep unless I heard him lie down first. I carved a little charm from birch, like *mémère* taught me—a small face, tongue stuck out, to ward off evil. I strung it around my neck with sinew. It didn’t help.

Then one night—must’ve been close to midnight—I woke up. The fire was low, just coals and shadow. Wind had died down. Eerie kind of stillness, like the woods were holding their breath.

Charlie wasn’t in the tent.

I sat up fast, heart already thudding. Slipped on my boots and coat, grabbed the rifle, and pushed open the flap.

And there he was.

Standing out in the snow.

Naked.

Bare skin glowing blue-white under the northern lights, which were out in full, twisting and writhing across the sky like smoke made of bone. No sound. No breath. Just him, unmoving, looking up.

His body was wrong. Too still. Muscles frozen but not shivering. Snow piled at his feet but didn’t cling to his skin.

And then he turned.

Slow. Like something remembering how to move a human body.

His face—his *face*—was calm. But his eyes.

God help me, his eyes were pits. Not black. Not empty. Just… *gone*. Like someone had scooped out everything inside and left the skin behind. I’ve seen dead bears, seen wolves with their guts torn open, seen eyes clouded with death.

This wasn’t death.

This was older.

This was hunger without a mouth.

He looked at me. And I knew—*knew*—whatever had followed him in from the blizzard hadn’t just followed. It had moved in.

It was *wearing* him.

Kise-Manitow, nîmâkwên.

Namoya wîhtikow, namoya.

Pîkiskwê nôhtê-nîmihito.

Miyo-pimâtisiwin mâka.

Great Creator, I am afraid.

No Sinew-Eater, not now.

Hear me, I am begging.

Give me a good life instead.

1ljwca5,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1ljwca5/m4f_unseen_by_him_desired_by_me/,"[M4F] Unseen by Him, Desired by ME","I’ve worked in your husband’s company for five years—loyal, efficient, and always giving my best. But no matter how hard I try, he never acknowledges me. No promotions, no raise, not even a simple ""well done."" To him, I’m invisible.

Then came the work trip.

He brought you along, though he barely looked your way. Meetings, phone calls, late nights at the office—he left you alone more than with him. I noticed the frustration in your eyes… the loneliness.

At first, we barely spoke. Then came the small talk over coffee, shared glances in the elevator, and conversations that went deeper than they should have. You asked me things—not just about the project, but about *me*. You said he doesn’t listen anymore, doesn’t see you.

That night at the hotel bar, he cancelled dinner again. You sat beside me instead. We drank. Talked. Laughed. And when your hand brushed against mine, neither of us pulled away.

Maybe it was wrong. Maybe it was inevitable.

All I know is, I’ve spent years being unnoticed… and you’ve spent years being unloved.

This trip might change everything—for both of us.
