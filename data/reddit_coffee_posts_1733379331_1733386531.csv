With the right furniture choices, you can maximize every inch of your home while keeping it cozy and inviting. Whether you're furnishing a compact apartment or optimizing a cozy villa in Dubai, these clever furniture ideas will help you make the most of your space.

# 1. Opt for Multifunctional Furniture

Invest in pieces that serve more than one purpose. For example, a sofa bed is a must-have for small living rooms. It transforms effortlessly from a comfortable seating area into a guest bed, making it a perfect solution for hosting friends and family. Look for [sofas in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/sofas) with sleek designs and storage options to add extra functionality.

Another great option is a coffee table with built-in storage or lift-top functionality. These tables double as storage solutions and dining surfaces, ideal for studio apartments or small living rooms.

# 2. Wall-Mounted Furniture for Open Floors

Wall-mounted furniture helps free up valuable floor space. Shelves, desks, and fold-away dining tables are excellent choices for compact homes. Wall-mounted [dining chairs in Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/dining-room-furniture/dining-chairs) can also be a game-changer, especially in tight kitchens or dining areas. Simply unhook them when needed and stow them away when not in use.

Floating shelves can replace bulky cabinets and create an airy feel while providing ample storage for books, decor, and daily essentials.

# 3. Invest in Space-Saving Sofas

When choosing a sofa for your living room, go for compact designs that don‚Äôt skimp on comfort. L-shaped or sectional sofas can be a smart choice as they make use of corner spaces that often go underutilized. Some options available in [house furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) stores come with built-in storage underneath, perfect for storing linens, books, or toys.

For the ultimate space-saving solution, consider modular sofas. These can be rearranged to fit your current needs, whether it‚Äôs entertaining guests or creating more floor space.

# 4. Folding and Stackable Dining Chairs

Dining areas often pose a challenge in small homes. Opt for a compact dining table paired with folding or stackable chairs. These chairs can be easily stored away when not in use, freeing up space for other activities.

Visit stores offering **dining chairs in Dubai** that combine functionality and aesthetics. Look for lightweight, durable designs that can blend seamlessly with your decor.

# 5. Outdoor Furniture That Doubles Indoors

If you have a small balcony or terrace, make the most of it with multifunctional [outdoor furniture](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/outdoor-furniture) that can also be used indoors. For example, rattan chairs or small bistro sets can transition effortlessly between spaces. Choose foldable outdoor chairs or tables that are easy to store, giving you flexibility without sacrificing comfort or style.

# 6. Smart Storage Solutions

Storage is key when living in a small space. Opt for furniture that offers hidden storage, such as ottomans, beds with drawers, or benches with lift-up lids. These pieces provide extra room for keeping clutter out of sight while maintaining a streamlined look.

# 7. Mirrored Furniture for a Spacious Feel

Mirrored furniture can create the illusion of more space by reflecting light and brightening up the room. Consider mirrored cabinets, side tables, or even a dining table to add a touch of elegance while maximizing your space visually.

# 8. Custom-Built Furniture

If standard furniture options don‚Äôt meet your specific needs, custom-built furniture might be the answer. Tailor-made pieces can be designed to fit awkward corners, provide extra storage, and optimize every square inch of your home.

# Final Thoughts

Creating a functional and stylish home in a small space is all about choosing the right **house furniture** and making the most of versatile designs. Whether you're on the hunt for **sofas in Dubai**, compact **dining chairs in Dubai**, or durable **outdoor furniture**, always prioritize pieces that offer dual functionality and complement your space. With a little creativity and smart planning, your small home can feel spacious, organized, and welcoming.

I had a look at Buy me a coffee and my hosting provider's offer and was wondering whether anyone here has experience in ""going it alone"" or white labelling.

Once a year, me and my partner (he loves fantasy and science fi, I love romance) pick one ‚Äòmeet in the middle‚Äô book and have a bit of a book club over it. I had seen this book everywhere and it was so highly rated. Looking at the genres, I wasn‚Äôt in to it at all. However I roared through it and loved it. Fast forward a year later and I think about this book every single day. It has put me in to a slump so deep, I fear I‚Äôll never get out of it. No book compares! I have tried a few books since but I mainly end up DNFing them. Here‚Äôs my book residing since for reference and star ratings.

**About Me:**
I'm an ambivert who loves a mix of outdoorsy fun and cozy indoor activities. Whether it‚Äôs hiking, biking, or playing volleyball, I‚Äôm always up for some adventure. On rainy days, I enjoy playing multiplayer video games (non-competitively) or board games‚Äîespecially the ones that stay fun even if I‚Äôm losing. I‚Äôm also a sucker for animal facts, history and crime stories.

Dating-wise, I‚Äôm a classic Golden Retriever boy‚Äîa loving, snuggly, and supportive partner and your words of encouragement will be my favorite daily fuel! If you have pets, you‚Äôll find me happily mingling with them too!

I'm at the final few years of my med school and I currently am planning to do residency in Germany, but I'm willing to relocate depending on the circumstances.

**What I Bring to the Table:**
I‚Äôm a bit more on the feminine side and love taking care of the people I care about. I can cook (a lot of soups), help with housework, and enjoy being of service to my friends or partner‚Äîit‚Äôs my way of showing love and appreciation.

**Looking For:**
I‚Äôm seeking friends to play games online or meet up in person (bonus if you enjoy board games or multiplayer video games). While I‚Äôm open to exploring connections, I don‚Äôt prefer long-distance relationships unless there‚Äôs a clear timeline for meeting.

**Ideal First Connection:**
Whether it‚Äôs a casual gaming session, or sharing fun stories over a cup of coffee, I‚Äôd love to start building a connection and we can see where it goes.

**Languages I Speak:**
I have a passion for languages! I‚Äôm fluent in three Chinese languages (Mandarin, Cantonese and Hokkien) and English. I can also speak some amount of Japanese, French, and German. (work in progress)

1h7440m,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1h7440m/california_sober_but_no_coffee_instead_of_alcohol/,California Sober but no Coffee instead of alcohol,"This is my take. Whenever I try to go ""fully sober"" I fail. I like substances. I like to have a drink sometimes. I like Kratom, THC occasionally. I like other stimulants.

Caffeine was the first substance I fell in love with, so who knows, maybe once it's done I won't want the other ones. But for now, they're helping me. I am not a strong enough person to cut out caffeine without them, if it wasn't for kratom, in fact, I just wouldn't be able to at all.

It might seem like cheating, but its what I can do. I've had a good 12 years witb caffeine. I think I learned from it and it has mostly been positive in my life. 

But it's time for it to go. In recent years, it has only become a tool to speed up time, to get through stuff I don't like. So I now have a life, that I mostly don't like. Funny how that works. It reminds me of that Adam Sandler movie click where he fast forwards his life. I mean, that's all stimulants really. But I find caffeine in particular to really numb my emotions, and just make me so soul-less. Right now, I get more benefit out of Kratom. If once my caffeine WD stop I feel more energetic and in a good mood again, I may go fully sober, but for now, I can't imagine just being miserable every single day, with no energy: my life would collapse.",2,1733385181.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1h740t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JacobJones2110/comments/1h740t4/how_infilm_advertising_affects_brand_perception/,How In-Film Advertising Affects Brand Perception Among Consumers,"At its core, in-film advertising relies on the psychological principle of subtlety. Traditional ads often face consumer resistance, as viewers are aware that they are being marketed to, leading to skepticism or avoidance. In contrast, in-film advertising seeks to bypass this resistance by embedding the product or brand within a scene, creating an almost seamless connection between the brand and the content being consumed. By making the product part of the narrative, viewers are less likely to feel ""sold to,"" as they may not even consciously recognize the product's placement.

In terms of cognitive processing, [in-film advertising](https://www.excellentpublicity.com/in-film-advertising-and-cobranding) engages consumers in a way that traditional advertisements do not. When a product is placed in a film, it often serves as a visual cue that helps to build a scene or character identity. For instance, a character who drinks a particular soft drink or drives a specific car may subconsciously convey certain traits to the viewer, such as youthful energy or sophistication. These associations can be powerful, as they create a connection between the brand and the emotions or themes of the film, helping to reinforce brand values and attributes without overt persuasion.

**Influence on Brand Perception**

The impact of in-film advertising on brand perception is multifaceted. First and foremost, the way a brand is featured in a film can significantly affect how it is perceived by consumers. For example, if a brand is associated with a beloved character or a high-status celebrity, viewers may develop a more positive association with that brand. The context in which the product appears also plays a crucial role in shaping perception. If a product is placed in a positive light, such as a character using it to solve a problem or improve their situation, consumers are more likely to form favorable opinions of the brand. Conversely, if the product is linked to a negative character or situation, the brand could suffer from a damaged reputation.

Moreover, the frequency and prominence of product placement can also influence consumer perception. A brand that is featured prominently throughout a film or TV show can create a sense of familiarity and trust. When consumers see a product multiple times in various contexts, it builds a subconscious recognition and acceptance of the brand. For instance, in the case of Apple products, viewers may not actively notice every time a MacBook or iPhone appears on screen, but over time, the ubiquity of these products in films and shows fosters a sense of reliability and desirability. This type of repeated exposure can solidify brand loyalty and increase the likelihood of purchase.

**Credibility and Authenticity**

One of the main advantages of in-film advertising is its ability to enhance a brand‚Äôs credibility and authenticity. Consumers often view product placements as less intrusive or manipulative compared to traditional advertising, making them more likely to trust the brand. When a product is seamlessly integrated into a film, it appears more natural, and consumers may believe that the brand's inclusion was organic rather than forced. For example, when a character is shown enjoying a specific brand of coffee in a casual setting, the placement feels authentic rather than a blatant attempt at selling the product.

However, the authenticity of in-film advertising can backfire if the placement feels too obvious or out of place. If the integration of a product disrupts the flow of the film or seems overly commercial, it can lead to negative perceptions of the brand. Viewers may feel that the filmmakers or the brand are prioritizing profit over artistic integrity, which can lead to a backlash.

**Consumer Engagement and Emotional Connection**

One of the most powerful effects of in-film advertising is its ability to forge an emotional connection between the consumer and the brand. Films and television shows have the unique ability to elicit strong emotions, whether it‚Äôs excitement, sadness, or nostalgia. When a brand is featured in a scene that elicits a particular emotion, consumers may begin to associate that emotion with the product. For instance, a luxury car featured in a high-octane action scene may become synonymous with thrill and prestige. Alternatively, a cozy home product placed in a family-oriented film could evoke feelings of warmth and comfort, making it more likely that the consumer will seek out the brand in the future.

In addition, the use of celebrities and influencers in films can enhance the emotional connection to the brand. When an actor or public figure with a strong fan following endorses a product through their on-screen persona, it can trigger a sense of admiration or aspiration among viewers. As consumers develop emotional bonds with the characters and celebrities they admire, the brands associated with them often benefit from this affection.

**The Role of Advertising Agencies in In-Film Advertising**

Advertising agencies play a critical role in the success of in-film advertising campaigns. They are responsible for strategizing and identifying the right opportunities for product placement, ensuring that brands are featured in films or shows that align with their target audience and values. Agencies work closely with filmmakers, producers, and directors to ensure the integration of the brand feels natural and fits seamlessly into the storyline. Moreover, [advertising agencies](https://www.excellentpublicity.com/) are instrumental in negotiating deals with production companies to secure favorable placements for their clients. They also monitor the effectiveness of these placements, analyzing viewer responses and brand perception to measure the success of the campaign. In the evolving landscape of digital media and streaming platforms, agencies are increasingly leveraging data analytics to predict which films or shows will attract the right audience, optimizing the impact of in-film advertising for their clients. Ultimately, advertising agencies are key players in orchestrating in-film advertising campaigns that maximize brand visibility and strengthen consumer perception.",1,1733384797.0,u_JacobJones2110,0,1.0,False
1h73zr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1h73zr0/looking_for_advice_and_thoughts/,Looking for advice and thoughts,"Hello, this is my first post here and actually my first ever Reddit post which means this situation is really getting to me, so here it goes!

In October, I (19M) met another guy (18M) who we will refer to as J on a dating app while at university and we immediately made a connection. I have had some past experiences which have mostly been restricted to FWB-situations and hookups but have never made an instant connection like J and I did.

We spoke for hours the first night and continued messaging for days. He was obsessed with me, and if I accidentally left him on opened on snap he would get nervous I didn‚Äôt like him. I got attached quickly and we met up a few days later on a night out and went back to his dorm. We slept together but also just talked, watched TV and lay in each other‚Äôs arms and like on text, we clicked in real life. 

We met up the next day for a sort of ‚Äòdate‚Äô where we went stargazing and then went back to his and just ate food and watched TV. It was perfect and by then I had caught feelings and he had too. Here I made the mistake however of assuming we were both progressing to a relationship. 

This continued until mid-November. He and I messaged all the time and continued to meet up and by this point I really was attached to J. J also was involved in the university theatre and he wanted me to watch his performance which I did, before going home for a weekend, and everything suddenly changed.

J became very distant, no longer responding to my messages within half an hour sometimes taking hours at a time to provide a one word response. He went from telling me everything and wanting to know all about me, introducing me to his friends, to just responding to me. It felt obligatory. 

It got to the point that the Monday I returned to uni, I was so anxious and convinced he didn‚Äôt like me that I made a huge mistake and tried to hook up with someone I used to message. I am ashamed of it and can‚Äôt really explain why except I was messed up and it was some sort of defence mechanism. However, I got half way through and found I couldn‚Äôt do it and left. J then messaged me, drunk, asking for me to come to his.

I did, and everything was normal. He was attentive, touching and kissing me, telling me everything I wanted to hear. It was as if nothing had changed. I did bring up his odd texting habit in a joking fashion, but I didn‚Äôt really get a response. We fell asleep in each other‚Äôs arms, and the next morning, he cuddled back into me. Surely he could not have been drunk then? Before I left, we kissed and held each other‚Äôs hand. I then asked on message if he would like to go out for coffee some time that week and he said he was busy but could try and find some time. 

However, he returned to barely communicating with me and it was causing me such anxiety that I sent him a long message asking if he wanted us to become serious and telling him I had fallen for him. He responded saying he also had feelings for me, but he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. We spoke a bit and he was very much about being busy, in a bad financial situation, not wanting me to wait around etc, but he told me I didn‚Äôt have to block him. 

I was in a state after that and still am, and this was 3 weeks ago. I went from talking to this person every day, someone who I cared and care for deeply, someone who knew a lot about me, someone who had seen all of me, to nothing. 

J never really reached out, and I tried a few times. He said he didn‚Äôt want me to think that I couldn‚Äôt message him and a week later I asked if he would like to go on a walk, and he said yes. However, I messed up and sent him drunk voice messages on a night out and he decided meeting up was a bad idea, saying the only reason he agreed was because he felt bad.

He then proceeded to tell me he felt nothing because he never got invested, and while I know I should just accept that, everything before this means I just can‚Äôt. The way he smiled at me, the way he looked at me, the way we were together - that kind of connection is rare, and he felt it too. I washed this man‚Äôs hair for the love of god! 

And so I blocked him, because I knew I was going to kill myself if this continued, but it was all I could think about. I miss him so much and it‚Äôs genuinely ruining my life. My friends, I can tell, are tired of hearing about it. 

On Sunday I hit rock bottom again and unblocked him and sent him a message. I didn‚Äôt receive an answer. Instead, on Monday, I found that I had been blocked. Weirdly, I feel relieved but also deeply confused. Why does he get to block me?

Yes, I acted poorly in the weeks after we ended it, but why am I the one who has to be embarrassed? All I was showing was the deep care I felt for him, desperately trying to get him to communicate and save what we had. But he apparently did not want that, so why does he not feel ashamed?

I should also add that I know from a friend who spoke to one of J‚Äôs friends that he is sad. They got to speaking and this friend mentioned J without even knowing that my friend knew me. This I also can‚Äôt make sense of. 

I was getting better at dealing with it but I keep hitting low points and I hit a bad one this evening. I was on Tinder and I saw his profile, and it killed me. Even seeing photos of him hurts. I know I can‚Äôt expect him to not move on, since that‚Äôs what I am trying to do, but every time I‚Äôm reminded of him I‚Äôm reminded of my failure - that I wasn‚Äôt enough for him to stick around for. 

I also saw Wicked this evening, which was something we spoke about doing together and the entire time I was thinking about how he should be there with me. In truth, I am tired.

I want this hurt to end. I want to stop caring, but I can‚Äôt. He made me care about him, deeply. J was the one to get obsessed first and now I‚Äôm the one stuck, and I don‚Äôt even know if he cares. I‚Äôm just so tired of him constantly being on my mind. I‚Äôm tired of the hope that he will come back. 

So why did he do this to me? Did he like me? Why did he block me? Why do I still care about someone who hurt me so much? Why did I forgive him the moment he hurt me? ",1,1733384668.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1h73yeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ListenToGrow/comments/1h73yeh/what_are_the_drivers_of_productivity/,What are the drivers of productivity?,"Hey everyone! I've been diving deep into productivity research lately, and I wanted to share some game-changing insights I've discovered about what really drives our productivity. This isn't just another generic ""wake up at 5 AM"" post ‚Äì I promise.

First off, let's talk about habits. They're the foundation of productivity, and I learned this the hard way. After struggling with inconsistent productivity for years, I discovered that small, atomic-level changes make the biggest difference. I recently listened to ""Atomic Habits"" on Audible (you can actually get it for free here: https://athometouch.com/atomichabits), and it completely changed my perspective on how habits shape our productivity.

Here are the key drivers I've found that genuinely impact productivity:

1. Environment Design
Your workspace matters more than willpower. I rearranged my home office to remove distractions, and my productivity doubled. It's not about forcing focus ‚Äì it's about making it easier to stay focused naturally.

2. Energy Management
This is huge and often overlooked. Productivity isn't about time management; it's about energy management. I track my energy levels throughout the day and schedule important tasks during my peak hours. For me, that's 9-11 AM.

3. Systems Over Goals
This was a breakthrough realization. Instead of setting ambitious goals, focus on creating systems that make success inevitable. For example, instead of saying ""I'll write more,"" I created a system where I write for 25 minutes every morning before checking my phone.

4. Recovery Periods
Productivity isn't about working non-stop. I've found that taking strategic breaks actually increases my output. The Pomodoro Technique works wonders ‚Äì 25 minutes of focused work followed by 5-minute breaks.

5. Habit Stacking
This is something I learned from James Clear's work. Attach new habits to existing ones. I started meditating by doing it right after my morning coffee ‚Äì now it's automatic.

6. Progress Tracking
What gets measured gets managed. I use a simple notebook to track my daily wins, no fancy apps needed. Seeing progress, even small wins, creates momentum.

7. Social Environment
The people around you dramatically impact your productivity. I joined an online accountability group, and it's been incredible for maintaining consistent output.

8. Physical Wellbeing
Sleep, exercise, and nutrition aren't just health factors ‚Äì they're productivity multipliers. Since prioritizing sleep quality, my focus has improved dramatically.

Implementation Tips:
- Start tiny. Really tiny. Like ""write one sentence"" tiny.
- Focus on consistency over intensity
- Create environmental triggers for your habits
- Track your progress without judgment
- Build in recovery time

I've found that reading about productivity isn't enough ‚Äì you need to hear these concepts explained in detail and internalize them. That's why audiobooks have been so valuable for me. You can actually get a free 30-day trial on Audible and listen to ""Atomic Habits"" (trust me, it's worth it) through this link: https://athometouch.com/atomichabits

The best part? You can listen while doing other tasks, which is perfect for productivity enthusiasts like us.

He then grabbed the two and put them on my lap inside the house when I was having my morning coffee and said to me tie them. 

That day we went on a walk and I almost stepped in some dog poo on our road and he said to me ‚Äúthere‚Äôs poo there, watch where you are walking. It‚Äôs like walking a toddler‚Äù

I struggle with brain fog, fatigue, anhedonia, and some social anxiety already, so I find myself avoiding social events even more these days because I have no trusty beverages (either coffee or alcohol) to get me through. 

Without either, I just feel like a doorknob, trying to force energy to be social but cognitively feeling slow and not excitable at all. Which leaves me even more depressed. 

Wouldn‚Äôt a tiny bit of caffeine be a healthier alternative to alcohol in those circumstances? Or would that ruin all the progress I‚Äôve made?

Growing up I used to be a daddy‚Äôs girl. I wanted to do everything with him like him coming to my school lunches anytime he could, playing WOW with him after school, asking him questions all the time. Once i reached middle school i started wanting to be around my mom more. I‚Äôd always go with her anytime she left the house, watched tv with her all the time, laid in bed with her and talked all the time. She was my best friend. We grew a lot closer when she was diagnosed with stage 4 liver cancer. any chance i could go see her in the hospital i would or call her anytime she was awake. i was around 13 when she got diagnosed and she was in a hospital about 2-3 hours away. So my dad would stay with her and come home once a week while my older sister (26F) watched me. Once my mom came back home we were inseparable. She truly was my best friend. I should also had that my dad has slight anger issues and a short temper. Growing up I would just take the anger he through at me without a thought. Until i met my current boyfriend of six years (24M). After about a year of dating he started talking to me more about my dad‚Äôs behavior. Mostly how he spoke to me. My dad would get livid over the smallest things. Like if we ever entered his office he would immediately yell ‚Äúwhat?!‚Äù and get annoyed, or once he asked me to do the dishes before he got home from work (which i did) but my sister put a dirty dish in the sink before he got home and he lost his mind on me about not doing one simple task. When i reached the age of 16 i had to get a job and provide for myself. Thankfully my mom helped a lot and wouldn‚Äôt let my dad be as harsh as he wanted to be. Sadly in 2021 my mother lost her battle to live cancer. When she got put on hospice i took a leave from my job to be her nurse. I went to CNA school and this was always my plan for if she got worse. My dad was livid that i took leave because that meant that his 17 year old daughter was able to pay the rent since she spent all her time with her dying mother. When she did pass he kept pushing me to go back to work everyday so i could start paying him rent. I was livid. My best friend and my own mother died and my dad just wanted money from me. Shortly after her passing he started dating an old coworker and moved in with her. He let my sister and I stay in our house and pay him rent. after a month or two we decided to ask our friend to move in to help with our rent. We told our dad about it and he agreed and then proceeded to up the rent. We stayed there for about a year until we all decided to move out except for my sister who still lives there. After moving out i took some space from my dad to clear my head. Now we barely talk. One time after i had moved out while being freshly 18 i experienced my first tire blowout on the way to a job interview. I called my dad frantically to ask him what i should and to hopefully borrow money for a new tire and to pay him back ( a few years prior to this my oldest sister experienced the same thing and he bought her four new tires) when he answered i told him what happened on the verge of tears because i was scared and by myself. The first thing he asked was ‚Äúwhat are you even doing out at 8 in the morning‚Äù after i told him why he told me to call my boyfriends dad and have him help instead since he ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt had his coffee‚Äù yet. I keep trying to reach out and everytime im met with short replies or lectures on how my life could be better. After my mom died i just wanted to know i had him still and i feel like im losing him too. anytime i speak with my sister she tells me that he calls her atleast once a week to check on her. before thanksgiving the last time we talked was October 1st when i was in the hospital. He didn‚Äôt even say happy thanksgiving until i messaged him late that night. I keep getting my hopes up that our relationship will get better but everytime i try im shot down.

1h73esp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h73esp,Managing Expectations ,"I have read a lot of posts on puppy blues and the majority of the responses are always ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù. My puppy blues never came from the pup, but we dealt with some health issues that stressed me out because I wanted her so bad and felt like I was failing her. That being said, I thought I would give my 10 cents about my experience and my approach to getting my pup. I am a single female who works 3 jobs, lives alone, and this is my first puppy.

I researched the breed and was familiar with their personality traits as well as read blogs on what to expect from puppies. I fully expected the first night of crying, waking up every couple hours to let her pee, potty training, etc. I wanted her to feel comfortable the first night, so I did not attempt crate training the first night (I live in an apartment and couldn‚Äôt risk barking) as she was free to roam with her litter initially. I slept on the couch and set an alarm on my phone. I was pleasantly surprised when she didn‚Äôt cry at all and only had to pee a few times at 8 weeks.

I set a strict schedule for her that was based on my life and stuck to it. When crate training, I read how people approached the breed and had to figure out what made her most comfortable, such as, an ice pack immediately soothed her and prevented her from panicking, she did not want the crate divided because she liked to sploot, and I only had to sleep in front of the crate for 2 nights, then the couch for another few nights but was back in my bed after a week. 

I used the month plus one rule for her pee schedule and when I noticed I had to force her awake, I added an hour. She slept through the night by 4 months, but potty trained immediately. She hated pee pads and would chew them up, so I trained her to go outside (I have a turf set up on my patio) and after a day she figured it out. She would have an accident from time to time, but it was mainly my fault if I didn‚Äôt take her out immediately after being crated.

 For days I was in office (2 days a week), I picked a dog sitter from Rover that was walking distance. We spoke about expectations since she was a puppy and needed more than just a simple drop in. She was the one who suggested the dog camera and kept an eye on her and would come over as needed initially.

I watched her behavior and noticed her signs of being tired (biting, barking, digging at the carpet) and just enforced naps. 

She is 6 months old now and phenomenal. She has been off leash in other people‚Äôs homes and respected she wasn‚Äôt allowed on their couches. We went to a restaurant and coffee shops and though she wouldn‚Äôt just lay around, she respected her leash and would watch calmly. She no longer jumps on my 18 month old niece when we visit. I learned early that she can learn commands instantly, but will push boundaries until she just decides to be perfect at it. 

Yes, it does get better, HOWEVER, patience and being prepared is the key. Your commitment to your puppy affects your outcome. Every post I read said to not get a Samoyed if you have no puppy experience, yet she has no separation anxiety (in fact loves when I‚Äôm gone because she has FOMO and gets to rest, and I know this because I watch her in the camera and she doesn‚Äôt bark or whine and calmly greets me when I come home and let her out), her barking is very minimal (we found training methods that work for us), and is just so amazing. I get so many compliments on her improved behavior and people are shocked when I say she is only 6 months. I was the strict mom from day 1, and though some exceptions were made (for example going on the couch), she adapted to my life. She is well loved, spoiled, and my world while, after only 3 months, I am back to doing whatever I want‚Ä¶though I prefer her to be with me when she can be. 

My point is - it does get better, but it‚Äôs also not bad as long as you are prepared for the worst and are willing to commit. I can go on and on, but I hope this helps someone feel like their puppy can adapt to you and that your life doesn‚Äôt have to turn upside down.

1h73e86,https://www.realclearhistory.com/2024/10/21/ancient_structure_found_in_glacier_1066394.html,"Ancient Structure Found in Glacier - On the Mountains of Ararat - Big if True, but Why? DEEP DIVE","Greetings! I hope you have a cup of coffee or something. Gary Eastman of Eastman Archaeology recently claimed to have discovered a structure *""on the mountains of Ararat""* which may bear some resemblance to a ship of some design. Obviously there are major connotations with such a claim. It is sure to garner attention. What is the significance?

You may have but more likely have not read the Bible, but you don't have to in order to know of Noah's Flood. Its one of the most well known legends of all time. It wasnt just told in the opening chapters of Genesis in the Bible. In some variation, the story of a deluge is told worldwide spanning time, space, language, and beliefs. Ive encountered many over the years. It carries the hallmarks of a shared experience, and it's not alone in that respect. While there any many versions and schools of thought, in my eyes, the accounts rendered are not regional floods if we take them in the manner they were expressed. The prevailing notion has seen fit to dismiss anything that is so extravagant as impossible. That is a discussion for another day.

To my knowledge, and it is limited, I do not know of any other ancient texts referring to the vessel used to survive the torrential waters from above and the waters from the deep coming to rest not on the mountains of Ararat. It goes without saying that this carries a *a big if true* dynamic. He wouldn't be the first to make the claim. The problem is it would probably be impossible to prove to the point of widespread acceptance.

He does mention the importance of this object being *any* type of man made object, but especially a vessel of some sort. This should not escape your notice. If it were, the big question would be how did it get there?

This isnt the only archeological riddle in the region and I don't just mean your garden variety Babylonian ziggurat. We are talking about Gobekli Tepe, Karahan Tepe, and Derinkuyu. The former two have been dated to the end of the last ice age 12 millenia ago. No dating has been done on Derinkuyu to my knowledge. In my view, it overthrew the established paradigm on ancient people in a day. Only 5-10% excavated, GT and KT have elicited uncomfortable silence on their true origin and story because humans were not supposed to have astronomical and architecture at that point in time. Its an astronomical marvel and there are different schools of thought on its meaning. Unfortunately we will never know the true extent or meaning. Its currently under control of the WEF and to some extent the Turkish government obviously but there are no plans to excavate the rest and in fact, an plot of trees has been planed on the hill that covers it. It's like they wish they never found it. 

The biblical version of the flood does not read as a first hand account. it reads as a story passed down. In the very few chapters in Genesis concerning the flood, little is said about the civilization which was ended in it. Only that they took no note, until tge flood came and swept them all away. They carried on eating and drinking and doing wicked things in the eyes of god and men. There were ambigious nephilim mentioned, only referred to as the mighty men of fame or renown. These nephilim had came to earth and the natural order was violated and the land was full of badness and violence. Evidently earthling women are smoking hot to all intelligent lifeforms as they were said to find them very attractive. 

There are more obscure accounts such as of Enoch. There is the *seven days of light* which preceeded the warm salty deluge mentioned both in Isiah as well as vedic accounts. There are legends of Atlantis and other hypothetical lost civilizations. The Mayans, maybe the most prolific mathematicians and extremely well versed on astronomy believed that there were previous versions of civilization and they referred to the time they inhabited as ""suns"" which stands in for age. They named each sun age based on the catastrophe which ended it. Water sun, fire sun, hurrican sun, and so on.They were obsessed and terrified of Venus, the smoking star. Many are well acquainted with the Yuga Cycles, the Hopi and other indigenous cultures. The Bible is among the more recent of the so called divine texts. However, it spans several world ages and describes several catastrophes which are generally interpreted as local or at best regional events but what does the evidence say? How about the images carved on rock and stone depicting the squatter stick man glyph worldwide? Did you know the Egyptian Ipuwer Papyrus reads like the very same events of the Exodus but from the Egyptian perspective? Of course, it requires you to actually read the text as it is constructed with far less allegory. The rivers turned blood. The pillar of fire and smoke in the sky. The chaos which followed. Hail mingled with fire. Then they were brutally invaded by a foreign power. The royal residence was overturned in a day the likes of which had never happened before. 

If a ship is discovered in a receding glacier on these mountains, it would only be one more piece in a long line of them hinting at extraordinary events. The geological record does not protest. On the contrary, it will attest to the record of great change the likes of which we have never observed and can't fathom. The seas have changed their beds. The highest mountains in the world are covered in sea shells and coral. Even in Switzerland interesting discoveries are made in retreating glaciers. The Arctic too is stratified with regularly spaced alternating layers of Arctic and exotic tropical fauna. The ice cores, the strata, the fossils, the isotopes, the elements, the carolina bays or the scablands, and on and on. 

At times, it feels like of every civilization that has existed, its only this current one which does not believe global catastrophe can and has happened before. We seem to be more like the days of Noah in that regard. Unaware. It would seem the Mesoamericans, the builders of Gobekli Tepe, the Vikings, the Vedas, the Sumerians and their offshoots, the Greeks, the native Americans and many more were presciently aware that this earth has been visited by great catastrophe from a variety of mechanisms. They often attributed it to planetary gods but why?

In addition, to the flood, another well know biblical prophecy is that of the Great Trubulation and Armageddon and they are downright terrifying to be honest but thats not all. The old testament ends with a mention of the sun of righteousness coming with healing in its wings and destruction to the wicked. The new testament ends with Jesus fortelling a time of healing for the righteous and fury for the wicked and goes on to say ""I, Jesus, sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the congregations, *I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.*

What is a Venus reference doing there? It's not the only one. I mentioned the Maya earlier. They have a calendar called the Tzolkin and it's their most important. It's timed with the synodical year of Venus. Every 52 years or so, the Mayan priests intently observed Venus and did unspeakable things as sacrifice to appease it. They feared Venus, the smoking star. Oddly enough the Jubilee explained in Exodus also shares a similar periodicity around 5 decades. The book of Exodus also saw the God Yahweh institute a new calendar. Stop a minute to grasp the significance of why a new calendar would be required? The Israelites and Egyptian papyrus described the rivers turning red and all the fish dying, scourge of vermin and insects, sickness, fiery hail mingled with fire, tempest, darkness, and death in the house of the chosen ones or first born. The Israelite story goes on to say they followed a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night and that it parted the red sea for them to escape  while drowning Pharoh and his warriors in pursuit. 

Iron oxide from extraterrestrial debris is known to turn rivers red in modern times, but in this account, it pervaded the entire land. We don't have a great theory for the name ""Red Sea"" FYI. Earthquakes and other geophysical events are known to make snakes, bugs, and insects in general leave the ground and behave strangely. The frogs left the water and the insects left the ground. Locusts were blown in by intense wind. Hail mingled with fire fell which could only be cosmic debris. The region went dark for days with no light and the Israelites would mention the shadow of death for generations to come. This could be explained by cosmic debris as well or volcanic eruptions. However, past this point, one starts to lose the ability to ascribe cause. Death of the first born or chosen ones and the parting of the Red Sea. The question some have asked and answered is whether there is evidence of catastrophic flooding in the region including Egypt and Arabia? The answer is yes. Some of you may have read the Ethical Skeptic piece on the erosion patterns on the Pyramids. The Sphinx as well. Big water action.

In a flight of fancy, just consider it as true. That the earth was visited by a pillar of cloud and fire which brought peculiar devastation and led to a major geopolitical shift in civilization by the collapse of Egypt ending with the Hyksos invasion and subjugation before reestablishing the kingdom in later times. The Israelites would go on to establish a lineage up to David all the way to Jesus. David chose the 6 pointed star as his sigil, a symbol used to depict the morning star. While wandering in a desert wasteland, the Israelites did not have a good time. The ground was unstable, the shadow of death was present, food didn't grow and they claimed to have been fed by manna falling from the pillar of cloud and fire. The Greek also have a similar legend of ambrosia. The environment was hostile for generations because it was devastated by these plagues brought by apparently a very very large comet now known as the planet Venus. Despite their fear of Venus, the israelites saw it as a savior and salvation and considered themselves chosen by the lord. 

Venus is a strange planet for several reasons. It's not near as earth like as originally thought. It behaves like a dynamically new planet. It's very hot light and dark side. Volcanoes and thick clouds of sulfuric acid dominate the landscape. It has a very large magnetotail like a comet which can sometimes be seen. It's rich in hydrocarbons. It rotates the wrong way and does so extremely slowly. Venus was known as the hairy or smoking star to some ancients. What if it arrived as a planet sized comet and made several close passes causing major upheaval in the solar system and exchanging blows in planetary warfare titanomachy with Earth and Mars before finally settling in and calming down, but slowly hence why it was so intently observed by various cultures in fear. The Mayans associate Venus with Quetzocoatal or the plumed serpent.

Ive taken you way outside what is considered accepted theory but nothing I have said here is without substance as written. By that I mean if we take the texts of the ancients at their word and drop the allegory. The greeks worshiped Zeus who dethroned and emasculated his father Kronos. Zeus is Jupiter and Kronos is Saturn. Both were widely worshiped at various points. Zeus slayed a fearsome sky serpent type creature with a lightning bolt but only after a great struggle. Phaethon was destroyed by a lightning bolt because he convinced his father Apollo to drive the chariot of the sun even though he wasn't capable. The Babylonian Marduk slayed Tiamat in similar fashion. Those are the legends as written. They are interpreted differently mostly on the grounds that what they describe is too incredible to be true so it must be all allegory or imagination. I would pose a simple question, what about a comet has ever scared you? Have you even seen one? Can you pick Zeus or Kronos out of the night sky? Why did ancient people build complex but similar legends around pale dots in the sky you can hardly make out? Saturn is widely worshipped to this day, albeit unknowingly by the vast majority of people. It's difficult to reconcile an imagination that powerful as the cause and the shared motifs. The question is how did they know? We believe they lacked viewing aids and relied on their eyes, yet nothing about our current night sky presents so much detail. They could carry out complex astronomical calculations and observations but how? The Dogon tribe of Africa is especially interesting because they worship the star Sirius. When anthropologist and archeologists inquired about their knowledge, they were shocked to find out that the Dogon understood that Sirius is a multi star system. It's one thing to see Venus and eek out some detail by careful daily observation but another to detect a binary or more star system with the naked eye. Edmund Halley finally cracked the eclipse code but only with major contributions from the Babylonian Saros Cycles. To predict an eclipse, lasting only moments in time, factoring sun, moon, and earth and their respective orbital mechanics and dimension, is not a small feat. Its downright incredible. 

All of this leaves one with the feeling we are missing something BIG. What was different? How and why? The squatter stick man glyph which is my avatar for this sub is the most widely shared symbol or glyph in the entire world. 100,000s of thousands of them have been located and analyzed. In nearly all cases, they are in rock sheltered locations facing magnetic south. What do we think the glyph is or what does it mean? It's a high energy plasma discharge resulting from an *extreme auroral event.* This was determined on the work of Dr Anthony Peratt of Los Alamos who easily replicated these shapes on small scales using known physics. The tree of life, the owl, the bull, the squatter man and woman, the emerald tablets, all have hallmarks of representing z pinch plasma instability/discharge. People who had good artistic skills were compelled to record the symbols seen world wide because of what it meant. The end. The most known adoption of the glyph would be the Carthagenians. They worshiped Tanit and Anat before her. They were depicted by the glyph as a sigil and seal. She was said to have destroyed the regions and ended the Phoenician empire. She was associated with destruction and rebirth. It doesn't dawn on many how significant such a shared symbol and the themes in which they are found is. 

Have you ever wondered why so many cultures worshiped bulls or cows or other animals with horns? When the Israelites made a golden image, it was of a calf. Why? Its likely because of the horns. The torus shape is a common theme in the plasma reproductions. Sometimes it's represented as horns but sometimes wings. There appears to be variance between experiences and vantage point.

Whenever I dive into the mysteries of the past, I am filled with a sense of wonder. I see humans as the descendants of descendents who witnessed the times in which ancient texts refer to. There and languages unable to be translated. Precious few fragments of important works. I see humans as a collective. Beliefs vary from place to place and people to people but I see what is shared and what the texts and legends have in common. There are archetypes which exist. I can only liken it to a murky river one must navigate without the aid of sight. You feel your way through, grasping for purchase and grip, and trying not to get carried away by the current or take the wrong tributary miles back only to find out it ends off a cliff. I exist in a state of possibilities. I see no need to definitively choose what is the true version of events and what is not. Much of what I rambled off here tonight is wholly dismissed by mainstream, but be honest. There's some logic to it. All one has to understand is we don't know everything or even close to everything and that its possible that foundational theories regarded as true today will be disregarded as false tomorrow as has been the case always. Has the solar system always been just so? Is dark matter the answer. Is it even real? What came before the big bang? How does something come from nothing? Does all change on our planet actually happen slow and gradually without exception or are the long relatively quiet periods punctuated with great upheaval recorded in rock and word. If it is slow, we can disregard rising volcanic activity, seismic activity, near earth activity, solar/magnetic/ionospheric activity and rapidly changing climate and oceans as just small secular variations of no consequence and never leading to anything which may endanger or disrupt the biosphere unless its  instigated by our own activity. 

However, if its by chance not always slow all the time and long stable eras are punctuated with relatively sudden catastrophe we will not see the changes beyond what is our scope and ability to alter as important and be completely bewildered and unprepared as earth systems go haywire much quicker than forecasted. This would allow us to remain blissfully ignorant until it was past denial that great upheaval will once again be upon us and would allow the powers that be to keep the capitalism party going for as long as necessary, providing funding and time for their own survival plans before the masses revolt. Bunkers are a hot commodity in the elite circles these days. What did the US military learn during Operation Nanook about the polar regions and why was it classified? Why was Chan Thomas book Adam and Eve Story classified? The stories behind these books and more are compelling but impossible to substantiate. Here is all I know.

If the USG became aware that earth suffers periodic catastrophe middle of last century and that we were likely to enter such a period in the coming decades, it would be a matter of grave national security and kept on a need to know basis at great lengths if necessary. To share that news with the wider world would surely end it before it's time as the ontological shock and fatalism took hold and both made people question their reality and the ramifications of impending trouble. They would view it was a mercy to not tell people. Why tell them and upset their lives when ultimately nothing can be done about it? Besides, the longer society goes on, the more resources and technology gained and prep can be carried out quietly at the same time. D.U.M.B. do exist. They didn't stop at the end of the cold war. On the contrary. How could such a long term strategy to keep under wraps be carried out? As much secrecy as possible, silence dissent or leaks when necessary, generally dismiss and ridicule catastrophism to the point of obscurity. Only fund science that fits the paradigm. Build theories to explain the ongoing change as something other than something beyond our control. Flood the infosphere with falsehoods and misdirection meant to muddy the waters and make it seem incredulous such a thing could be true even in the slightest. This way anyone who stumped for a catastrophist theory would automatically be discredited and disregarded as a conspiracy theorist delusional paranoid person by association with the topic. 

Ultimately I can't tell you what is true and what isn't. I can give you both sides or offer my own read but at this level, hard facts are hard to come by. Three people can read or translate the same text and render it differently. We lack alot of data and records for earths as well as mans history. We have incomplete pictures of all components and we are forced to fill in many blanks in an attempt to build coherent modeling. We haven't convincingly answered a great number of riddles from the past. A lack of evidence isn't the same as no evidence. Mostly what we have is theory and theories crumble while reality and universe marches on unaffected and unaware of them. Keep an open but skeptical mind. Understand you don't have to believe anything. Its just helpful to know all sides. In this exercise, we are covering what they don't teach in school.

I really enjoy reading the bible. I find it incredibly fascinating and it's historical accuracy is impressive. I think its special in the same way I do many relics of the past. I also can't help but note the compelling prophecies embedded. There certainly feel like some words written yesterday for today but this is subjective. While I entertain the possibility of the bible being special, I have no desire to be seen as *religious*. I wouldn't want to be grouped in with any church or equivalent. They wouldn't want me anyway because I am a heretic in their eyes too for interpreting the book differently than the orthodox. Sometimes I wonder if the orthodox has even read it considering the butchering of it and the invocation of practices which are firmly against what is in it.

Not to mention that just like in business and finance, entertainment, sports, and charity, every day we see corruption and misuse of power. Some of the ugliest atrocities in history were committed due to religious fanaticism. Some of the most heinous systematic patterns of abuse originated from those claiming to represent God. In the bible, the religious leaders were usually the bad guys.

I see that faith isn't fact. It's a belief first with confidence in the outcome based on unproven or subjective evidence. Its more prevalent than you think on many levels. I just keep an open mind and try to get the messages from the past as they were intended.

I was shocked, I cried because I was scared of what my life would look like, but there was no pain in my heart. A few mornings after I had a coffee and I felt peaceful - I thought it was delayed grief.

Then I realised that she was my abuser. I remembered everything, it was all coming back to me, memories became clearer.

In general my job has been very good with giving me reasonable expectations and a good work/life balance since becoming a mother; I have no complaints with the amount of work or duration. 
It‚Äôs just that the nature of my work involves very early shifts. On many mornings, I‚Äôll have to be out the door when my children have only begun to eat breakfast. I‚Äôll maybe get in a diaper change and a hug, then have to chug my coffee and leave the rest to my partner (daycare drop off and everything). 
There are plenty of days, like today, it‚Äôs 3:30pm and I‚Äôm already on my way home from work. So I guess it is nice I get that time with my kids.  It‚Äôs just, I feel like the morning is the better chunk.  They‚Äôre always so happy and affectionate in the morning. 

In the afternoon, usually after (often early)daycare pick up, you have to deal with all their emotions from the day. Sometimes they‚Äôre tired/ cranky. Sometimes they don‚Äôt even want to leave their friends and that fun. They‚Äôll be clingy, etc.
Of course it isn‚Äôt every day, and I clearly have so much to be grateful for; I shouldn‚Äôt complain.  

It‚Äôs just that sometimes I really wish I worked the kind of job that started and finished later in the day, rather than the opposite.  It was never this way before I had kids. Maybe it will be better when they get a little older (not quite 2 yet lol), but yeah. That‚Äôs basically it.  I miss mornings with my kiddos. ",1,1733381516.0,beyondthebump,1,0.67,False

4:30 pm : coffee 
5-6:30 pm : gym
6:45pm : 4 boiled egg white

Wall of text ahead.

So yeah. Seems pretty clear I got the Aspie burnout again.

Need help this time I think, but as to getting it? That's the challenge.

And look, I love all of my friends, and I know they'd help if they could. But truth is, none of them are equipped to deal with me in that regard. They just cannot give what I need, and nobody ever really has. I tend to have always fixed myself. Always soldiered on. Always forced myself to be functional. üòÜ

As my parents said ""Oh we didn't help you, because you always seemed so independent, so functional"". Lot of people have expressed that sentiment. I was that way because I had to be, not because I wanted to be.

And for once in my life I can admit I cannot do it. What's absurd though? If anyone of my friends or anyone for that matter needed my help, I'd jump straight up and help them with 100% effort.

I just cannot do it for myself. Always been more functional for other folks than I am for myself. I got solutions for all your problems. But for me? Sometimes. I often just have zero regard for myself. Latched onto the rules like 'put others before yourself' a bit too strongly. But isn't that what we always do?

Heck in Aspie terms I'm ancient. üòâ

Many built like me don't make it this far. I'm a unique specimen and I need some factory level specialist maintenance.

Problem is finding someone qualified enough to get under my hood and check my oil, that won't rape my wallet in the process.

$500 for an hour seems.... ridiculous. üí∏

Given time I can fix myself, as I always do, but life don't stop and I don't have time. The world insists on pushing itself into our lives. A good month long break from all of human society would do me wonders. No bills, no real estate agents, no trades people, no doctors, no cops, no politicians. No human concepts and society. Period.

but ""Computer says no....."" üõë

Metaphorically speaking of course.

Doesn't matter what you actually need, if society says you cannot have it.

Part of the ship, part of the crew. In the tree, part of the tree. ‚òπÔ∏è

I want to jump in a life boat and paddle away.

Things to do, that need to be done, and I just don't have the energy.

I don't have my usual drive, it's been waning slowly for years now. I'm physically and mentally exhausted. My Aspie parts just want to shut down, and I'm struggling to keep the lights on like I never have before.

Man, what I'd give to have the space I need right now. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to be left alone completely. I need my friends right now if only for emotional support.

It's the people external to my life I want to fuck off and leave me alone.

To just leave alone and  let me live my life as I choose for once in my, well, life. To stop telling me to do things their way, without flexibility without compromise. To stop making me feel that what works for me and impacts them in no way is wrong.

Got some appraiser coming around tomorrow to evaluate my rental properties worth. I just want to tell them to fuck off. I cannot be bothered faking appearances and run around making my home suitable to a strangers standards. To be judged by someone who doesn't know me and is forcing their way into what I pay a premium to call my home. Never stops. REA's, tradespeople, all year round. And nothing gets fixed, and your rent goes up. And well..... yeah, you know what I mean.

I should be cleaning. sweeping and mopping. And I am just sitting here drinking coffee, chain smoking ciggies. even rolled a blunt. I know it's gotta be done, my brains screaming move, but the body won't comply. Want to type a wall of text on reddit instead. This is not me. It's the friendly monster that lives in my head who only comes out on very very rare occasions.

This is how it goes though. You hold it in and bury it deep for a long time.

You vent steam here and there, but instead of exploding and melting down, you just crash and the system wants to shut down. You implode on yourself.

And the worst part is you can see it, but you cannot stop it. I like being in control of myself, on every level but it's like the brain disconnects from your body and the body gets a mind of its own, that monster I mentioned. ""It's like sorry brain, this is for your own good. I'm taking the wheel."" and all you can do is sit back and watch.

Not like I didn't see this coming. Been searching for help and reaching out for years. I tried to head it off.

Just alas, couldn't find exactly what I need. I never do. At best band aids. But I really need to this time.

There was no lack of effort, that's for sure. I'm uber functional. Until I am not. Just difficult to find even doctors who understand you, that realise the normal shit that works for NT's and Autistics do not work for me. That are able to meet the requirements.

I got a pile of straw on my back to burn away, and I need help burning it. I'll recover. I always do. But I'm worried the damage is going to be massive to my life in a way I've never allowed it to be.

I will take back the wheel, I always do. Just not going to be in time this time.

But man, I'm so so tired. Feels good to let go, to fall into the abyss. So good I'm crying and I want the monster to just keep on driving for a lil bit longer. Just a lil bit. I swear. But man. Not caring if I crash and burn, having no desire to fix the damn problems created by others. To just become apathetic to everything including myself. It FEELS.TOO.DAMN.GOOD.

Be easier if this damn world worked the way it should for everybody.

Don't worry about me. I'll get over it. I always do. Just gonna take a little longer than normal to swim back to the surface.

1h73510,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1h73510/kendu_inu_its_about_patience_conviction_and/,"Kendu Inu- It‚Äòs about Patience, Conviction and Dedication","Murad Mahmudov, one of the most well-known experts in memecoin circles, recently made an interesting statement that (in my experience too) hits the nail on the head for investors active in the memecoin narrative.

He said, the key is finding memecoin communities with this prerequisites:
- Inspired people hustling daily
- 6+ months old
- Survived multiple large drops
- Holder Count growing every month
- $20 Billion+ Target
- Great Distribution + Diamondhands

Amazingly, this applies exactly to Kendu Inu, to all 6 points.

Conversely, it logically takes some time until you see these key factors as a result on a price chart in the long term and KENDU has been developed for multiple cycles.

Murad also emphasized, continuous holder growth is the most important KPI for a meme coin in itself.

After a strong retracement phase it‚Äôs already clear, Kendu is currently gaining massively, both in terms of the number of holders and the number of interested observers and followers. The number of followers on X has almost doubled within a month and is now at just under 21,000, while the r/KenduInu_Ecosystem subreddit is very likely to reach 5,000 members in a few days.

This is the result of the patience and conviction, but above all the breathtaking dedication of the community that has been present since day 1 and is even more evident now after the difficult late summer/fall period, see below.

I bought KENDU already in May, when the community already was dominating in the subreddit r/memecoins (so dominant, there was set a post limit of 2 KENDU posts per day by the mods later). 

The consistently high shill- and raiding-power level (along with the fact that the dev had a great track record with the SHIB dev team) ultimately led me to join this army. After joining, my conviction for the KENDU community was confirmed. To be exact: 

1. It does not only promote like crazy 24/7 on channels like X and Reddit, but also IRL (you can find countless great videos have been produced by now). 

2. It has turned Kendu into a brand: There is now a Kendu energy drink, coffee, jewelry and clothing. According to my information, there are plans to expand the distribution of energy drinks from Australia and the USA to other continents.

3. It has dominated all (fair) polls against other coins. 

4. It became even harder (more battle-hardened) during the hard consolidation and redistribution phase, since It showed its immunity to FUD and price drops.

5. It recently aroused the interest of two tier 1 exchanges OKX and Bitget: Both has started campaigns for the community (listing potential).

6. We are actually only the third Memecoin community to have managed to get a free audit from Certik by getting 50,000 votes! (Please note, you can only vote on Certik once per day!). The audit further increases the chances of listing on the top 10 CEX, as it guarantees the credibility (authenticity) of the coin.

Eventually, I‚Äôd like to bring up the man who created this community, our doxxed DEV Miazaki. He is currently working on bridging (via wordhole communication) between the ETH and SOL chains (Base is also expected to follow). This can significantly increase the market reach, volume and liquidity for this coin. It is also known that a second NFT collection (Kendu Chads) will be launched soon. The trading revenue will mainly be used to finance further exchange listings or to refinance in the Kendu token, another potential leverage effect on liquidity. Miazaki will present the project at the Shibcon for the first time IRL.

The trend of holdercount and the recent sustained strong increase in followings is no surprise, but simply the result of unmatched community work and their conviction, which can also be attributed to Miazaki's upcoming big moves. The MC still at 25m $, so now it‚Äôs the best opportunity to get in and make the most of this Altseason.

I have recently gone through cancer and had to face mental health issues. I have been very self absorbed for almost 3 years now. Minimal friends, no outings or events, minimal social life at all. No hobbies. Protecting myself but also working on my recovery and me, now.

I have however spent alot of time online, dead quiet. Browsing only. Much of my time has been spent listening to a ton of music (rnb is my favourite) and until recently, losing myself in tv shows like Greys Anatomy (it never ends...) and right now Xfiles (amazing! no idea why I never watched it before). 

Now I am cancer free and my mental fog has cleared. I am ready to make friends and connect with people. After everything I have been through I can connect on different levels with different people. I love the usual - coffee, food and activities but I also am branching out into some new hobbies I would love to share, experience and learn from others.

 I want to connect with you and to have a life with people in it so I am reaching out.

I am about to start making my first gothic embroidery - a moth. I have never embroidered before. Can you share some tips? Works of art or knowledge with me?

I want to learn to DJ using a DJ Controller (if you DJ Id love to hear from you!)

I have also found a passion in fixing and selling vintage and antique clocks - some are stunning and I am always happy to share my WIPs.

I know alot of people read these posts but never respond. It's hard to work out what to write to get interest.

A few years ago I ruptured my intestine and was bed ridden for months. After that I became incredibly sedentary. As a 6'5"" guy I came from 190lbs to 280lbs, gaining over 90 lbs in fat. I has to toss my entire wardrobe. Unfortunately because of how fast I gained weight with no nutritionist or physical therapist to mitigate that after my surgery, the scar healed terribly and now I have a huge painful and uncomfortable abdominal scar. In the past few years I've gotten down to 245lbs as of today but I've been incredibly unhealthy, barely eating, still sedentary, and have hit a hard plateau. Now I'm getting serious. I've talked with a handful of fitness coaches and am ready to commit. I've gotten a nice set of weights, bands, kettle bells, and workout clothes. Having spoken to a surgeon about scar revision, I would have to SIGNIFICANTLY increase my core strength and get down to at least 210- so that's my main goal weight. Beyond that, I want to get strong. I'd love to do weightlifting and strongman events, tough mudders, etc. Maybe even a marathon. But that's for later. Today I had to move a ton of furniture and cleaned my house top to bottom and worked up a sweat for a while so I'm cheating and counting that as my exercise. I have the MacroFactor app and have written down a few Jeff Nippard daily routines until I can get an official plan from my coach. I got a few protein shakes, bars, and vitamins too to help. I'm not a coffee drinker and my energy is terribly low so I'll need the caffeine. I wanna do this right. No real rush as the surgery I want is expensive so I have all the time in the world to develop healthy habits. 

P.S. while I got rid of all of my ""skinny"" clothes, I kept my favorite Calvin Klein string tank top. I'll wear that thing everywhere once I hit my weight goal!!! ",2,1733380539.0,loseit,1,0.75,False

I don‚Äôt know why things went off the rails this time. I noticed the things mom will typically do like ‚Äúfixing‚Äù the arrangement of my stools or claiming she moved the books on my coffee table to a side table because they fell when she reached for something, but I didn‚Äôt say anything, just let it go. I tried on cultural outfits for her, even let her measure me to have more made for a wedding which is a big deal because my weight has always been a problem in our relationship. I don‚Äôt know if that emboldened her or what, because she starts fixating on a chair that I have in a closet I rarely need which she wants to get rid of. Just obsessed. We‚Äôve spoken about the damn chair so many times and the last visit she asked more than once every, single, day!!  I‚Äôve explained nicely over and over why it is there and what I‚Äôm waiting for to get rid of it. I‚Äôve even pointed out politely that she has asked me 4 times already and the answer hasn‚Äôt changed. I suspect it became a real issue for her when she decided to give a relative a tour of my home and threw open all the closets and felt embarrassed that this one looked messy because it is basically my storage for things I can‚Äôt throw just yet.

Mind you, she isn‚Äôt coming to me with a solution. She‚Äôll just keep saying that she and dad can help me get rid of it and then repeat the same options I‚Äôve already explained won‚Äôt work right now.  So she takes it to my dad. Except she doesn‚Äôt tell him she has raised it to me many times. She doesn‚Äôt tell him that I didn‚Äôt ask her for help, that this was something she wants to do and has convinced herself is helping me. And while I tried once again to calmly explain to dad that no, I can‚Äôt just leave it by the trash bins and no I don‚Äôt really want to spend my last day off researching other options, I finally got frustrated and pointed out to my mom that I didn‚Äôt want to do this right now and she‚Äôd been bothering me about it all weekend. 

Well apparently ‚Äúbothering‚Äù is a disrespectful word to use when describing one‚Äôs parent because my dad then jumps into fight mode. And before I know it, it‚Äôs 2:1 rehashing all our problems only it‚Äôs worse now because it‚Äôs over a stupid chair. I kept looking at my mother barely holding back tears of rage and asking why? Why couldn‚Äôt you just let it go? Why did you keep pushing until we get to this point? 

And oh the gas lighting. She starts tearfully asking what she has to do to finally convince me that she loves me and would drop anything to be with me and help me. Which is bullshit. I don‚Äôt for a second think I should be her top priority at our ages, but the idea that she‚Äôd drop everything to help me is empirically false. And because at this point I had no self control left‚Ä¶ I shared one example. And then had a total internal meltdown, hands shaking, scared I‚Äôm crazy or have a tumor because not only my mom who I know doesn‚Äôt remember anything that makes her feel bad, but also my dad who I can usually count on to be honest, insists that what I‚Äôm talking about never happened. They demanded I show them proof - texts, emails, something in writing because neither has any memory of it and looked at me like I was horrifying and horrible for suggesting that they might have done anything like that, like what kind of person would say such a thing about their own mother. And I‚Äôm frantically parrying two people coming at me about how ungrateful and mean I am and how they walk on eggshells (so do I!!!) and why can‚Äôt I just let things go for my own parents, while trying to find anything that would prove my memory is real. But I couldn‚Äôt. I gave up and just stuck to the conversation and to do them credit they didn‚Äôt ask for proof again or point out that after looking I hadn‚Äôt found it. But I sat there thinking I‚Äôd made it all up. That I‚Äôd lost my mind and would need help. Eventually everyone lost steam and dad changed the subject. 

 An hour later I found the proof. So yay, I‚Äôm not insane. And spent the next day in agony from stomach pain I can only assume is from stress while they pretended nothing happened and doted on me while I was ‚Äúsick‚Äù. 

If someone told me they needed advice or help, I‚Äôd feel totally comfortable telling them they can rely on my parents. They are genuinely generous and kind to everyone else. I hate that I get this version instead.",11,1733380316.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,1.0,False

Need help this time I think, but as to getting it? That's the challenge.

And look, I love all of my friends, and I know they'd help if they could. But truth is, none of them are equipped to deal with me in that regard. They just cannot give what I need, and nobody ever really has. I tend to have always fixed myself. Always soldiered on. Always forced myself to be functional. üòÜ

As my parents said ""Oh we didn't help you, because you always seemed so independent, so functional"". Lot of people have expressed that sentiment. I was that way because I had to be, not because I wanted to be.

And for once in my life I can admit I cannot do it. What's absurd though? If anyone of my friends or anyone for that matter needed my help, I'd jump straight up and help them with 100% effort.

I just cannot do it for myself. Always been more functional for other folks than I am for myself. I got solutions for all your problems. But for me? Sometimes. I often just have zero regard for myself. Latched onto the rules like 'put others before yourself' a bit too strongly. But isn't that what we always do?

Heck in Aspie terms I'm ancient. üòâ

Many built like me don't make it this far. I'm a unique specimen and I need some factory level specialist maintenance.

Problem is finding someone qualified enough to get under my hood and check my oil, that won't rape my wallet in the process.

$500 for an hour seems.... ridiculous. üí∏

Given time I can fix myself, as I always do, but life don't stop and I don't have time. The world insists on pushing itself into our lives. A good month long break from all of human society would do me wonders. No bills, no real estate agents, no trades people, no doctors, no cops, no politicians. No human concepts and society. Period.

but ""Computer says no....."" üõë

Metaphorically speaking of course.

Doesn't matter what you actually need, if society says you cannot have it.

Part of the ship, part of the crew. In the tree, part of the tree. ‚òπÔ∏è

I want to jump in a life boat and paddle away.

Things to do, that need to be done, and I just don't have the energy.

I don't have my usual drive, it's been waning slowly for years now. I'm physically and mentally exhausted. My Aspie parts just want to shut down, and I'm struggling to keep the lights on like I never have before.

Man, what I'd give to have the space I need right now. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to be left alone completely. I need my friends right now if only for emotional support.

It's the people external to my life I want to fuck off and leave me alone.

To just leave alone and  let me live my life as I choose for once in my, well, life. To stop telling me to do things their way, without flexibility without compromise. To stop making me feel that what works for me and impacts them in no way is wrong.

Got some appraiser coming around tomorrow to evaluate my rental properties worth. I just want to tell them to fuck off. I cannot be bothered faking appearances and run around making my home suitable to a strangers standards. To be judged by someone who doesn't know me and is forcing their way into what I pay a premium to call my home. Never stops. REA's, tradespeople, all year round. And nothing gets fixed, and your rent goes up. And well..... yeah, you know what I mean.

I should be cleaning. sweeping and mopping. And I am just sitting here drinking coffee, chain smoking ciggies. even rolled a blunt. I know it's gotta be done, my brains screaming move, but the body won't comply. Want to type a wall of text on reddit instead. This is not me. It's the friendly monster that lives in my head who only comes out on very very rare occasions.

This is how it goes though. You hold it in and bury it deep for a long time.

You vent steam here and there, but instead of exploding and melting down, you just crash and the system wants to shut down. You implode on yourself.

And the worst part is you can see it, but you cannot stop it. I like being in control of myself, on every level but it's like the brain disconnects from your body and the body gets a mind of its own, that monster I mentioned. ""It's like sorry brain, this is for your own good. I'm taking the wheel."" and all you can do is sit back and watch.

Not like I didn't see this coming. Been searching for help and reaching out for years. I tried to head it off.

Just alas, couldn't find exactly what I need. I never do. At best band aids. But I really need to this time.

There was no lack of effort, that's for sure. I'm uber functional. Until I am not. Just difficult to find even doctors who understand you, that realise the normal shit that works for NT's and Autistics do not work for me. That are able to meet the requirements.

I got a pile of straw on my back to burn away, and I need help burning it. I'll recover. I always do. But I'm worried the damage is going to be massive to my life in a way I've never allowed it to be.

I will take back the wheel, I always do. Just not going to be in time this time.

But man, I'm so so tired. Feels good to let go, to fall into the abyss. So good I'm crying and I want the monster to just keep on driving for a lil bit longer. Just a lil bit. I swear. But man. Not caring if I crash and burn, having no desire to fix the damn problems created by others. To just become apathetic to everything including myself. It FEELS.TOO.DAMN.GOOD.

Be easier if this damn world worked the way it should for everybody.

Don't worry about me. I'll get over it. I always do. Just gonna take a little longer than normal to swim back to the surface.

1h72v9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1h72v9s/mixing_am_with_modern_dating_style/,Mixing AM with modern dating style,"Last night, I posted a comment about my BIL's approach to the arranged marriage (AM) process in our joint family. He‚Äôs a successful surgeon, and we‚Äôre actively involved in helping him court prospects. This includes fine dining, thoughtful chats, coordinating, arranging flowers for first dates, and small gifts for 2nd or 3rd dates. It‚Äôs all about making a great impression and fostering genuine connections.

But some men dismissed this, claiming we might attract ‚Äúgold diggers.‚Äù 

One even questioned what these accomplished, career-driven women bring to the table. This mindset is frustrating. My BIL enjoys these dates‚Äîthey‚Äôre a break from his super busy life and a chance to connect. He makes an effort: dressing well, picking up and dropping off his dates, going on long drives‚Äîall of which we see as investments in building a meaningful relationship.

Here‚Äôs my question: If you‚Äôre unwilling to court a partner‚Äîcomplaining about splitting bills for a simple coffee date or fearing fine dining‚Äîwhat‚Äôs your plan for attracting successful, high-earning, charismatic women? 

Equality seems to end at bill splitting, yet some men still expect women to move in with their parents and live traditionally. Why not make an effort with romantic gestures instead of dismissing them as unnecessary because it‚Äôs AM?

Are we doing it wrong, or is this fear of gold diggers just plain delusional? Would love to hear perspectives from both men and women.

I'm totally new to this and I'm nervous as hell but here we go. Thank you in advance for taking time to review the first draft of my query.

Dear <Agent Name>,

Twenty-seven-year-old Chloe Ling has spent five long years at Prime Capital Insights as the office errand girl ‚Äî fetching coffee, drowning in paperwork, and dodging her boss‚Äôs rage. She's resigned herself to a life of quiet misery, unnoticed except when something goes wrong.

That is, until she starts hearing a voice in her head. Jazaa, a magical mentor, insists she‚Äôs destined for more. When grotesque beasts called Broken begin plaguing her life, Chloe transforms into the Masked Maiden, a magical warrior tasked with stopping them before they spread destruction.

Balancing monster battles with looming work deadlines is harder than it seems. As each fight drains her emotionally and physically, the toll of her double life awakens an old struggle she thought she had buried. Her history of self-harm resurfaces, poking cracks through her new, powerful facade.

Chloe's growing isolation is made worse by the people around her, each pulling her in opposing directions. Jazaa pushes her to embrace her destiny without fully explaining the cost. Mage, a charming yet secretive ally, constantly appears in her dreams to harm her.

Polly, the office intern and boss's niece, gets promoted, leaving Chloe grappling with jealousy. And then there's Aiden, her coworker, whose unexpected interest in her stirs up emotions she isn't ready to face. With her own demons to deal with and trust in short supply, Chloe must decide whether she can truly save anyone if she can't even save herself.

SHIFTS TO SPELLS is a standalone New Adult Urban Fantasy Novel complete at 60,000 words, inspired by the magical girl genre with a dark and mature twist such as A MAGICAL GIRL RETIRES by Park Seolyeon and HURRICANE HEELS by Isabel Yap.

As someone struggling with mental health, I have drawn upon my own experiences regarding self harm, therapy, and recovery to bring Chloe's story to life. Mental health is a subject that's near and dear to my heart, which is why it's often a focus of my stories.

Thank you for your time and consideration.",2,1733379817.0,PubTips,2,0.75,False

The Problem

1. ChatGPT‚Äôs Robotic Tone:
AI-generated text often feels artificial and lacks the relatable, human touch.


2. Time Constraints for Startups:
Building a brand through storytelling (reels, blogs, or journey logs) requires significant time and creativity.


3. Storytelling Expertise Gap:
Not everyone can write captivating startup stories or create compelling visuals to accompany them.




---

The Solution: StoryCraft AI

A website where users can input a short text or idea, and AI transforms it into:

1. Relatable Narratives: Write in a ""bro,"" friendly, or first-person style that feels human and engaging.


2. Expanded Stories: AI-generated long-form content with clear sections, phases, or milestones.


3. Custom Visuals: Automatically create AI-generated images for each section, tailored to the story.


4. Startup Diaries: Turn quick inputs into a cohesive diary of your startup journey.


5. Imaginary Narratives: Generate fictional stories with a structured start, process, and end based on your prompt.

Step 3: AI-Enhanced Narrative

The AI expands your input into a full story with:

A strong intro to hook readers.

A detailed process/milestones section to highlight challenges and successes.

A conclusion tying everything together.



Step 4: Visual Enhancements

For each section or phase, AI generates:

Relevant Images: Custom, high-quality visuals that match the story‚Äôs tone and content.

Example: A celebratory image of a startup team for a ""launch day"" section.

1h72rku,https://www.reddit.com/r/MbtiTypeMe/comments/1h72rku/what_is_my_friends_function_type_or_his_stack_and/,What is my friend‚Äôs function type or his stack and what does he use more compared to me? ,"My friend and I were talking the other day about the differences between us. He posed the question what I would do if he needed an albi and for me to lie to the police. I told him it depends on the crime, and he used the most drastic example of hiding a body. I told him it would depend on what the other person did, if they had been an innocent person then id turn him into the police. My friend said he would hide the body for me no matter what the stranger did, because he values human connection more than the morality he‚Äôs imposed on the world in his mind. He‚Äôs extremely introverted to the point of disliking almost everyone but with his close friends he‚Äôs reallly considerate, he‚Äôs the kind of person to buy you a gift based on one thing you said a long time ago. He told me he believes that it‚Äôs so hard to find genuine human connection it‚Äôs much more worth it to lie to the police for his friend placing the connection over morality no matter what they did. We have opposite ideas on that. I asked him if he‚Äôd want his friend to learn or if he should let them face consequences for their actions because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd want but he says he wouldn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs not mine or his place because the world is painful enough and we all have limited time so he‚Äôd rather his friend just be happy. I would never even be friends with someone who‚Äôs capable of crossing certain morality lines but he said that it‚Äôs all subjective and therefore he would be. I agree certain things are subjective however their and tangible points that should not be crossed because they manifest in our reality but he believes basically it‚Äôs completely subjective especially being a good friend. 


My friend is very artistic, he loves to draw and create works of art, he is extremely introverted and needs a lot of time to recharge by himself. He is very kind but not a nice person. He says that he has no empathy and is just a very good liar but I don‚Äôt believe him that he has no empathy. He acts like everyone‚Äôs friend even if he doesn‚Äôt like them but they usually have to invite him first. Then later he tells me about it. I think he is pretty bored, he says the world does not interest him and he feels very alienated from everything like he never belonged in the first place. He pretends to like dark black coffee to fit an aesthetic admitted to me if he actually had to choose he‚Äôd pick a latte with a lot of whipped cream. 

If we both studied a certain branch of philosophy , he believes in looking into the actual philosophers life, trying to understand the events and societal situations that caused the person to think the way they do, like trying to pinpoint what exactly caused them to be the person they are in history and whether it could or could not be recreated. Whereas I don‚Äôt believe in idolising a single person or trying to pin point the external events that culminated in someone to creating works of writing or philosophy because I believe the work they created, the ideas are much more interesting and tell you a lot more about their state of mind at the time and is a reflection of societal values and social norms. Their actual beliefs are what interest me, im not interested in the person behind them. I‚Äôd rather discuss how their quotes and arguments are related and in the world and he would rather figure what they mean especially what the artistic was thinking, how did he come up with theory. 
 He believes that ideas are just ideas whereas I live in them and place more significance in them than my external reality.  

He‚Äôs extremely intelligent and openly admits he‚Äôs very good at manipulating people to get what he wants except he doesn‚Äôt really care or want much so never really does it. I‚Äôve seen it happen. He is pretty manipulative. But also he doesn‚Äôt lie maliciously, and doesn‚Äôt do it most of time to harm people. Mostly it‚Äôs just white lies.

After reading all the posts here about the differences b/w the OL and VL, I am happy to report I picked up a Pixie and it's fantastic...so far.

I wish I had taken the time to research, read the posts on here before I picked up the Vertuo Next last summer. It was on a whim and a great sale (now I know why... lol) and it wasn't until it started breaking down (not working, making dirty water, etc) that I decided to research more and came across this subreddit. Man, I can see why so many of you don't recommend it! I watched You tube videos and tried all the tricks to try and fix my machine, but nothing worked. I was shocked this happened after less than a year.

I decided on the Pixie because I love espresso type drinks, and read on here that some folks just add boiling water to make an americano if you want more of a regular coffee size drink. Also, I am back and forth b/w my apt and family cabin, and I travel a lot, and boy was the VL Next heavy and bulky. The pixie is way smaller and lighter, and takes up a lot less space on the counter as well. For those in small apt's or don't have a lot of counter space, this is something to consider.

I was thinking of getting the Essenza Mini as I read on here that many people like it and it's also small... but I couldn't find it in the store and the Pixie was on sale ($100 off--worked out to about $130 CDN) which made it only a little bit more than the Vertuo Next (I think I paid $120 or so for that one). I think I made a good call, and I'm grateful for all the posts, advice, comparisons b/w the VL and OL on here. I'm also happy that the OL pods are easier to get/find and much cheaper as well. Better coffee and cheaper pods? Not too shabby.  Thanks everyone! :) ",2,1733379413.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False
