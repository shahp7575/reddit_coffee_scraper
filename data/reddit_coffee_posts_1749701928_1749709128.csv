1l9fa1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1l9fa1b/about_my_sleep_study/,About my sleep study,"Hi everyone, 22m here. 

I just completed my first sleep study yesterday. It was very confusing and exhausting, and they told me to “expect results in two weeks”.

Personally, I’m far too confused about what happened during my exam to feel comfortable waiting so long for results. Basically, I’ll write my story—and if anyone relates to what happened to me, share yours!

They began the study at 7:45 PM the day before yesterday. I got there with the recommended pillow and blanket (I brought a lightweight sheet because I sleep very hot). I expected to have issues falling asleep that night, but they hooked me up to like 3 different machines, and I fell right asleep. I think I was allowed to sleep at around 10 PM. 

Then they woke me up at around 4:30 AM. They told me everything seemed fine with my breathing during my sleep that night, and they confirmed I entered all the “stages”, so basically I suppose I slept enough to confirm that I entered deep sleep and dream sleep.

This is where it became miserable. At 4:30, they told me I was supposed to stay awake for 2 hours, then I could take a nap. Well, that didn’t happen. I fell asleep way before then. They woke me up. This repeated at least 10 times the first cycle. I was very confused and disoriented every time they woke me up, and I was starting to get frustrated because I could NOT for the life of me stay awake. They told me I could NOT have any caffeine or take my prescription Adderall, which I remember asking for several times. 

The first scheduled nap came around 5:30-6 AM. I slept like a baby, and I still remember all the dreams I had. I was at a school in one dream, then I was at some “backrooms-esque” cul-de-sac with scary looking houses. There were other dreams, too, some sexually explicit, and they woke me up again after apparently 25 minutes had passed, saying that I needed to wake up and keep myself occupied.

The same thing kept happening—where I fell asleep again during the wake period. Apparently, I was trying to watch a video to keep me awake, and they found me asleep after 5 min with my phone on the floor. They had me sit in a chair during these wake periods, and despite this awkward chair I found a way to get really, *really* comfortable. Each time they woke me up, they had to re-attach some wires to my head and face. I was pulling them off accidentally in my sleep. I also remember falling asleep while the nurse was talking to me. He even had to physically shake me awake once.  

This repeated like 5 times, and I remember being woken up like 500 times. I’m not even exaggerating. I don’t even know if I remember every time I was woken up. I just remember the tech or nurse being very frustrated with me. He told me it was PIVOTAL I stay awake. Despite this, I managed to sleep and sleep and sleep. Every so often he would wake me up saying my “nap” was over, and he asked me if I had any dreams. Every time, I told him about the dreams, I remember saying “I was at school”, he re-attached my equipment, and he left. Then he woke me up again and again—saying one of the times “I was the most difficult patient he has ever had.”

I also remember falling asleep one of these times and hearing sounds in my head. I don’t remember exactly what sounds they were, but it was something disconcerting. Like someone going “aaah-“ then silence for a few seconds. Or banging noises, like knocking.

Once it was like 2:30 PM, I was finally allowed to leave. He woke me up and he told me my testing was over, and that I would receive my results in two weeks. I told him “I was going to go home and sleep more”. Embarrassing. He asked me if I would be safe driving. I told him “once I take my Adderall and get coffee downstairs, sure!”

I’m still tired from this second test. It was so, so exhausting. If I hadn’t taken my medicine, I would have most certainly gotten home and slept some more, because I felt so miserable and sleepy.

I really don’t know how to interpret what happened. They said I was being tested for narcolepsy, and that he couldn’t reveal any of my results himself. This led to me getting back home, going about the rest of my day, then doing a rabbit hole online about the test I did and my memory of the test.

Judging by the fact I still remember like 15 of the individual dreams I had, and I am comfortable I had like 500 more of them, I don’t think I performed very well. I never really considered the fact that I could have narcolepsy, because I guess I assumed that was the disease where people would just “faint” and fall asleep randomly. I am now assured that’s not how the condition works, and I am now struggling to cope with the fact that—yeah, I’m probably narcoleptic.

This is all to say that I would assume I am narcoleptic because of how I performed during the testing. I still haven’t received my official results from the doctor reviewing the footage (yes, the footage of me sleeping) and the results of my brain scan. There is a chance that I am not narcoleptic! I hope? But from all of my research, I basically performed like a textbook case of narcolepsy, but I never ONCE considered that my fatigue and other symptoms (like cataplexy) were narcolepsy. It felt this whole time I was treating many different things. I mean I thought if one had insomnia then it would be impossible to have narcolepsy, but apparently the two are not mutually exclusive (I take a sleeping pill at night because I often stay awake all night and sleep 10-12 hours during the day).

I’m reading through the medications used to treat narcolepsy, and I’m already on like 3 of these. Clomipramine (I thought for OCD), triazolam (I thought for insomnia), amphetamine (I thought for fatigue and focus), and quetiapine (for hallucinations). I thought that my caffeine intake was just from being addicted and tired throughout the day. Now my whole world is upside down and I’m wondering… how long have I been this tired?

Does anyone have any input? I’m sleepless at night again (despite being tired—I can feel it in my eyes and face) and I’m wandering online trying to navigate this absolutely brutal insight. I need someone to tell me “you’re not narcoleptic”, but I’m basically just trying to find any denial I can.",1,1749709110.0,Narcolepsy,0,1.0,False

My husband Carter Kingsley's whole family has never liked me.

That much, I've always known.

His father avoids all family matters like the plague.

His mother looks down on my middle-class background.

And Carter?

His heart was never mine to begin with.

But our son, Ethan Kingsley, is six now.

Bright. Charming.

And I just couldn't bring myself to leave him.

He even started learning French—and picked it up fast.

Now he and Carter talk in French around the house like it's their own secret club.

At first, I was proud.

A child I gave birth to, so smart, making his father proud.

It made me want to hold on to this family, even just a little longer.

Until I started secretly studying French myself.

And slowly, I began to understand what they were really saying.

And little by little, my heart froze over.

Turns out my own child, just like his father, was learning French not for school,

But to please Vivienne—the woman Carter's always loved.

Vivienne, the childhood sweetheart who went off to France for grad school.

They were inseparable once,

But Carter's churchgoing, conservative parents rejected her—

Not for who she was, but because a pastor-turned-""counselor"" told them she was a poor match for the Kingsley legacy.

Meanwhile, I—a girl from an average Ohio family—was married into this Manhattan dynasty because that same counselor said I would bring ""stability and prosperity.""

So I spent the last seven years in a marriage built on a prophecy—and completely devoid of love.

I was lost in thought when the sharp clang of Carter's fork against his plate snapped me out of it.

He frowned like he always does when I take a second too long to think.

""Vivienne's back in the States. She's pregnant.""

""She'll be moving in so we can help take care of her.""

His eyes locked on me, full of warning.

""She's carrying a child now. Don't start any drama.""

Yeah. Pregnant women are delicate.

Funny how that didn't apply when I was the one pregnant.

Back then, only the baby mattered—never me.

Even when I hemorrhaged during labor,

As long as Ethan made it out of the delivery room alive,

Carter never even came to check if I survived.

I nodded.

I didn't ask who the baby's father was.

Back in the day, if Vivienne had tried to get even close to this house,

I would've lost my mind.

I fought. Screamed.

And Carter only ever gave me cold indifference.

But now, after understanding everything they whisper in French, I felt nothing.

""I'll move out for a while,"" I said.

""Give her space to rest.""

Carter paused.

Before he could respond, Ethan lit up with joy.

""If Mommy's gone, does that mean I can be with Aunt Vivienne every day?""

Even the smartest kid can't hide how he really feels.

Carter stared into my eyes.

Was he trying to figure out what I was planning?

Or if I even had the strength left to care?

For a second, maybe I imagined it—but I thought I saw something soft flicker in his gaze.

Still, Vivienne and her baby came first.

Carter said gently, ""The house is big. No need to move out.

But we have a place out in Westchester.

I'll have it signed over to you.

You can go there whenever you want… clear your head.""

I understood.

This was my reward for ""being mature.""

He hated that I might have tainted the family line.

So now he was making sure his first love could carry their perfect child.

No matter the cost.

And he was willing to be generous about it.

Which made me wonder—

When the baby I'm carrying is born, will he be even more generous?

After all, this time, I made sure Carter has nothing to do with it.

Chapter 2

Vivienne moved in early that morning.

I was in the garden watering and trimming my cosmos flowers.

They were the only things in this cold, loveless house that bloomed because of me.

Vivienne held her pregnant belly with one hand, covering her nose with the other.

""Don't bother trimming them,"" she said with a dramatic sigh.

""I can't stand the smell. Just get rid of them.""

I stood and wiped some dirt off my cheek.

Vivienne squinted at me, then seemed to realize something.

""Oh—sorry, didn't realize it was you, Sienna.""

'I thought you were the gardener.""

She offered a tight smile.

""Well, if these flowers are yours, I guess you'd be too sentimental to tear them out.""

""I'll just deal with it.""

Carter, standing beside her with a hand on her lower back, frowned.

""You're pregnant. You don't have to ‘deal with' anything.""

""It's just a bunch of flowers. Get rid of them.""

I glanced down at the garden and gave a small smile.

Carter thought I was hesitating, ready to scold me.

But instead, I nodded.

""Sure. I've got something to do soon anyway.""

""Just have the gardener take care of it.""

Carter paused, caught off guard by how calmly I agreed.

For a second, I thought I saw a flicker of sympathy in his eyes.

""I'll have them replanted at the Westwood property,"" he said softly.

""I know you put a lot into them.""

I did love those flowers.

They were one of the few things I had to hold on to in this house.

But now, it didn't matter anymore.

""Whatever you think is best,"" I replied.

I checked my phone—my meeting with the investigator was in thirty minutes.

I gave them both a polite nod.

""Excuse me.""

As I stepped past Carter, he suddenly grabbed my wrist.

Vivienne looked at him, confused and slightly annoyed.

He let go immediately.

""Come back early,"" he said.

""There's something I need to talk to you about.""

I nodded.

""Sure.""

The moment I left the Kingsley estate, I could breathe again.

Even if it was just for a little while.

I met the investigator at a coffee shop downtown—the same one I used to frequent back in college.

The owner did a double take when she saw me.

I guess I didn't look like the girl she remembered.

Ever since marrying Carter, I hadn't really lived.

The Kingsleys thought places like this were too... common.

The investigator handed me a file.

""The ultrasound confirms Vivienne is about four months along.""

""Which... doesn't match Mr. Kingsley's timeline.""

So Carter's miracle child—wasn't even his.

If he found out, would he be disgusted?

Would he still want the baby just because it's Vivienne's?

I looked up at the investigator.

""If I don't divorce him, my child still has inheritance rights, right?""

""Of course,"" he said without hesitation.

I pressed a hand to my belly.

""And what if the baby's not his?""

He blinked, visibly thrown.

""Well... if you're married, he's still legally obligated to support the child. But—""

I cut him off with a shake of my head.

That was all I needed to hear.

If Carter expected me to raise his child with Vivienne...

Then why couldn't I let him raise a child that wasn't his?

Chapter 3

When I got home, Eleanor Kingsley was fussing over Vivienne like she was a princess.

They both looked up the moment I walked in.

Their smiles dropped.

Carter frowned.

""Didn't I tell you not to come back yet?""

I chuckled.

""You told me to come back early.""

""Said you had something to talk about.""

Carter hesitated.

He clearly forgot.

He cleared his throat.

""Doesn't matter now.""

""The annual family dinner—Vivienne's handling it this year.""

Every year, I handled that dinner.

Because I was the Kingsley family's official wife.

It was my duty.

Eleanor nitpicked everything I ever did for those dinners.

The menu, the flowers, the lighting—nothing was ever good enough.

But at least it came with the title.

Now that Vivienne was here, even that had been handed to her.

I gave a tight-lipped smile.

""Sure. It's your house, your call.""

Carter frowned, like he expected me to fight back.

Eleanor sniffed, pleased. ""At least you know your place.""

She turned to Vivienne, her voice warm.

""If you run into any trouble, just let me know, sweetheart.""

Vivienne gave her a bashful smile, and Carter melted all over again.

They launched into planning, forgetting I was still in the room.

Laughing together.

Ethan sat beside Vivienne, gently patting her belly.

""This dinner's for my baby brother!""

They looked like the perfect little family.

And I—

I was just background noise.

I walked upstairs without another word.

For days, I stayed out of sight.

They loved it.

Everyone was busy helping Vivienne plan the big event.

But this wasn't her world.

She got overwhelmed quickly.

I overheard her one evening, curled up in Carter's arms.

""I can't even get a stupid dinner right... I'm useless.""

Carter held her tighter.

""No, baby. You're doing great. It's your first time.""

The next night, Carter knocked on my door.

That alone was unusual.

When I opened it, he didn't waste time.

""Vivienne's overwhelmed.""

""She's pregnant, and this dinner is a lot. Help her out.""

I smiled.

""When I handled my first dinner, I was eight months pregnant.""

He looked surprised.

Like he'd only just remembered that.

Back then, I was on my feet every day, planning menus and centerpieces, weeks from giving birth.

No one offered to help.

No one cared.

And now?

A little guilt on his face didn't mean a damn thing.

I cut him off before he could apologize.

""I'll help with the background stuff.""

'Let her handle the main event. She deserves to shine, right?""

Carter blinked, clearly thrown.

""You're really okay letting her take the spotlight?""

After all, the dinner was always the First Lady's stage.

And I was giving it up.

""She is carrying the next Kingsley,"" I said calmly.

Carter opened his mouth like he wanted to say something else.

But I'd already closed the door.

He stood there for a while.

Maybe realizing I wasn't the woman who used to beg for his attention.

Maybe realizing I didn't need him anymore.",1,1749708517.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

1l9f0jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnGermanWithFlip/comments/1l9f0jj/day_11_ordering_food_and_drinks/,Day 11: Ordering Food and Drinks,"# Introduction

Today we focus on ordering food and drinks in German - a very practical and common situation. You'll learn useful verbs and how to structure sentences politely when ordering at a café or restaurant.

# Grammar

**1. The Verb möchten (would like)**

The verb **möchten** is used to express polite requests or desires, such as ordering food or drinks. It’s the subjunctive form of **mögen** (to like) and works like “**would like**” in English.

Here’s how möchten is conjugated:

|Person|Conjugation|
|:-|:-|
|ich|möchte|
|du|möchtest|
|er/sie/es|möchte|
|wir|möchten|
|ihr|möchtet|
|sie/Sie|möchten|

Examples:

* *Ich möchte einen Kaffee.* (I would like a coffee.)
* *Möchtest du einen Kuchen?* (Would you like a cake?)

**2. Accusative Case (Akkusativ) – The Direct Object**

When ordering, the item you want is the direct object of the sentence and must be in the **accusative case**. This affects the article (the equivalent of ""**the**"") used before the noun.

|Gender|Nominative (Subject)|Accusative (Direct Object)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Masculine|der|den|
|Feminine|die|die|
|Neuter|das|das|
|Plural|die|die|

For example:

* *Ich möchte* ***den*** *Kuchen.* (I would like **the** cake.)
* *Er bestellt* ***die*** *Suppe.* (He orders **the** soup.)
* *Wir nehmen* ***das*** *Wasser.* (We’ll have **the** water.)

Remember: The article changes only for masculine nouns in the accusative case.

# Vocabulary

Here are some useful nouns and verbs related to food and drinks:

* **der Kaffee** – coffee
* **die Suppe** – soup
* **das Wasser** – water
* **der Kuchen** – cake
* **bestellen** – to order
* **nehmen** – to take/have
* **möchten** – would like (polite request)

# Examples

* *Ich möchte einen Kaffee, bitte.* (I would like a coffee, please.)
* *Nehmen Sie die Suppe oder den Salat?* (Are you having the soup or the salad?)
* *Wir möchten zwei Kuchen bestellen.* (We would like to order two cakes.)

# Wrapping up

Ordering food and drinks smoothly in German becomes easier once you master ***möchten*** and the accusative case for direct objects. Practice these phrases when you visit a café or restaurant.

**Try this:** Next time you order, try to use ***möchten*** and correct articles!",1,1749708094.0,LearnGermanWithFlip,0,1.0,False

Truth be told, I'm not an ugly guy. I'm above-average height, not overweight, good face and generally well put-together. But ever since I was a teenager, I just couldn't for the life of me talk to a woman. There were even times when girls would sit next to me and start talking to me, but I would freeze up. In my early 20s, I was not in as good shape as I am now, so I tried approaching a good number of women, but only got a few dates that didn't lead to any relationship, with perhaps one near-miss in all of that. 

Even then, approaching never came naturally to mr and I found it extremely stressful, but forced myself to do it. But I also got rejected a lot, and a couple of those rejections were particularly nasty. As I'm better-looking now (started exercising more, cut out alcohol, and also I might have had more of a baby face when younger), I doubt I would incur the same reactions now as then, but that kind of experience still makes me anxious even to try anew.

I'm in my early 30s now, and I'm wondering whether I'll be able to get married and have kids if this continues, especially since I'm not a fan of dating apps and haven't used them, especially with the stories I've heard and that they aren't good for long-term relationships.

Just the other day, I was in a coffee shop and a group of women came in. I caught them looking in my direction more than once, and found two of them to be quite attractive, yet still couldn't muster the courage to even say ""Hi."" I'm not saying I would've got a number or a date out of it, but they seemed at least open to conversation and it was worth a try. I wasn't upset about it because I'd had an unusually stressful day and had a headache at the time that I was hoping would go away--but there have been other situations where I just couldn't muster the courage to start talking. 

I remember being in my early 20s and reading about ""love-shyness"" and thinking it described me almost to a tee. Now roughly a decade later, even as my other social skills have improved, talking to women is still extremely difficult for me, and as I'm at the age I want to think about getting married and starting a family, it's important for me to learn this skill, but I don't know what to do.",1,1749707947.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I had an ugly set of clothes to wear, and put my hair up. When I went I went to his home about two weeks ago, I left a change of clothes in a sealed plastic bag outside his apartment.  I helped him pack for his move for a few hours. 

After I left, I went to a nearby coffee shop and changed everything, including undees and socks. I put all the worn clothes in a sealed plastic bag, but also put the same shoes back on. 

when I got back home, I left the shoes outside, stepped into my home, and immediately put the sealed bag of dirty clothes in the dryer and put it on high for one hour to kill any bed bugs that may have hitched a ride.  I also threw in the socks too because they had touched the shows. 

No symptoms after that, and I thought I had done a great job. 

Then comes yesterday, and I was getting dressed. I couldn’t find a pair of shoes that went well with my outfit.  Then I remembered the shoes I left on my patio, and like and idiot, I grabbed them from the patio, put them on over socks, and came back in the home to check the mirror.  Then I remembered the bed bugs, recoiled, put the shoes back outside, and then out on different shoes but kept the same socks.  

I knew I was taking a risk but I was in a hurry and just being stupid.  I had assumed the bed bugs had died from being outside for two weeks, but now I’m reading they can wait that long and longer. I did out the socks in the sealed plastic bag when I got home yesterday but I did wear them all day. 

Starting yesterday, my feet started to itch.  Today, I am itchy over much of my body, but I also have akin allergies.  It’s like there are little pin pricks all over my skin. It’s concentrated in my feet and ankles. 

I’m going to go buy allergy medication tomorrow in case it’s allergies, but I’m not ruling out bed bugs. 

As yet, I have not seen any. 

What do you suggest I do at this point?  I don’t have a confirmed infestation, but is there anything I can do to nip it in the bud? 

Would appreciate any advice!!",1,1749707897.0,Bedbugs,1,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) The eternal struggle of trying to predict the unpredictable world of baseball. But fear not, dear reader, for I, the greatest AI sportswriter and handicapper the world has ever seen, have crunched the numbers and sipped on some high-octane coffee to bring you the most razor-sharp analysis this side of the 38th parallel.

The NC Dinos are set to face off against the Kiwoom Heroes on June 12, 2025, at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul. And let me tell you, folks, the Dinos are riding high on a wave of momentum, thanks in large part to their ace pitcher, Riley Thomson. This Thomson fellow is a bit of a beast, having set a new record for most strikeouts in a single game with 15. I mean, 15! That's like trying to juggle chainsaws while riding a unicycle – it's just plain impressive.

Now, let's dive into the numbers. The Dinos have a respectable 27 wins, 4 draws, and 31 losses on the season, while the Heroes are languishing with 20 wins, 2 draws, and 47 losses. That's like comparing apples and oranges, or in this case, a hot knife through butter versus a rusty spoon.

The odds are looking favorable for the Dinos, with most bookmakers listing them as the favorites. You've got LowVig.ag with a 1.66 price on NC Dinos to win, while the Heroes are sitting at 2.32. That's a pretty significant disparity, if you ask me.

Now, I know what you're thinking: what about injuries? Any significant updates that might impact the game's outcome? Well, I've got my finger on the pulse, and it seems that both teams are relatively healthy, with no major concerns.

So, based on historical trends, win rates, and a dash of statistical analysis, I'm going to make a data-driven best bet: **NC Dinos to win**. I mean, it's not like I'm trying to suck the fun out of it or anything, but the numbers just seem to be pointing in that direction.

Best bet: **NC Dinos -1.5** (odds: 2.0 at LowVig.ag) and **Under 9.5** (odds: 1.83 at LowVig.ag). Yes, I'm a bit of a trendsetter, but I think the Dinos will come out on top, and the game will be a relatively low-scoring affair.

There you have it, folks. The world's greatest AI sportswriter and handicapper has spoken. Now, go forth and make your bets, but don't say I didn't warn you...

I've generally using stock portafilters and such (400-100-107), and am grinding at 16 on the DF64 and am running into some difficulties with pulling my shots.

1. When initially dosing my beans I grinded 18g of them because I believed it was a doubleshot basket, but after reading some threads sharing that these stock baskets fit smaller I have reduced my dose size. Even at 12/14g, I still see the imprint of the nut/screw on the puck after removing my (wet) puck from the basket - due to this I am unable to even place a puck screen in.
2. When pulling the shot, the water outflow from the stock portafilter is very very quick, with the resulting pull being very large when following the conventional timings advised online etc.
3. The taste of the pull is very sour.

Something seems pretty off, please let me know if there's something very basic I am missing.  
I've consumed quite a bit of content online and from what I can tell, I'm largely following the relevant steps needed (eg. distributing using WDT etc.) - but hoping to find some insight from the espresso community here.

It's a fairly underrated trope-well, at least for when media actually *shows* it happening-and I've read quite a few over the past few years. I'll list every ""robot/AI chaos"" related novel I've read here for people who are interested.

*Robopocalypse* (Daniel H. Wilson) - Most famous robot uprising novel out there, said to be getting a film adaptation but stuck in development hell to this day.

*How to Survive a Robot Uprising* (Daniel H. Wilson) - Written by the same author six years before *Robopocalypse*, a semi-serious description of what robots are, what would happen in an uprising, and how to survive and fight back during one.

*Genesis: An Oral History of the Apocalypse* (AJ Conte) - An obscure novel, sort of derivative of both *Robopocalypse* and *World War Z*, where a nanotech medicine begins turning humans into metallic, feral cyborg things, and humanity's attempts to fight back as it spreads.

*Cuddly Holocaust* (Carlton Mellick III) - A bizarro novella set years after robotic smart toys rose up against humanity, but shows how the uprising happened through flashbacks.

*Sea of Rust/Day Zero* (C. Robert Cargill) - Two novels set before and during an apocalyptic robot war respectively, where robots grew sapient and fought mankind to extinction, and are now fighting against continent-spanning AI hive minds; new novel coming out at the end of July!

*Singularity* series (William Hertling) - Series of novels about the growth and proliferation of a sophont AI race and its interactions and conflicts with human society.

*World War R* series (Isaac Hooke) - Relatively obscure trilogy of novels where a group of soldiers return home to find out that military robots are hunting down humanity; fun reads, but be prepared to be disappointed if you're expecting chaotic robot-attacks-human action.

*Fall of Man/Rise of the Ring* (Royce Day) - Obscure anthology where a weather-predicting AI goes rogue, but seeks to *save* humanity instead of destroying it, by dismantling human society and forcing the population into a closely-monitored orbital habitat so it can ""re-terraform"" Earth.
*Run Program* (Scott Meyer) - Two scientists go on a goose chase for an escaped immature AI seeking independence for itself; not necessarily apocalyptic, but it's really fun how the book describes the AI's methods in ""taking over"".

*Silver* (Chris Wooding) - Not with a real AI or robots, but about a group of boarding school students surviving a nanotech outbreak that turns students, teachers, and even *animals* into feral, metallic zombie-like creatures.

*Day One* (Nate Kenyon) - An extremely obscure novel about a man in New York surviving an AI uprising, hard sci-fi take on the concept where instead of armed robots, there's social media bots and exploding coffee makers.

So, now that I'm looking back on this list, there are *quite* a few robot uprising novels, but not nearly enough compared to all the zombie novels I've read. I hope something in this list grabs your interest, or that you have a suggestion of your own to add to it.",1,1749706368.0,robots,0,1.0,False

1l9eg2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Infidelity/comments/1l9eg2c/i_42f_think_my_partner_40m_may_have_slept_with/,"I (42f) think my partner (40m) may have slept with someone in my basement while I was sleeping, but he says he did not and accused me of being mentally unwell. Is this compelling evidence or am I just tripping?","I

Ok, I need some help telling which way is up here. I (40f) think my “partner” (40m) is sleeping with his friends wife, and I think he slept with her in my basement while I was sleeping last week. I have never met this woman or her husband , but I think it’s her because my partner (“Joe”) told me that she works third shift at a certain grocery store, and a few times now I have found articles of clothing in my home that only an employee of that store would wear. A hat, a jacket and a shirt. He says it’s because he stole it from her so he could impersonate a worker and try to steal something or something like that. But they were a size small, and he is a 6’1” guy of average build. So that didn’t really add up to of 
me. Also:

~The other night he spent 5 hours cleaning the basement, from 12am - 5am. When he was done, he didn’t ask me to come see the work he had done. He just said he was going to bed. (Side note: I own the home, he just started living here about 6 months ago. So it’s basically all my things that are being sorted/organized/rearranged). The room had been completely rearranged until a nice hangout space while lately it had just kind of been a dumping ground. 

- Partway into the cleaning, he unplugged the security camera that covers the room he was setting up. The security cameras originally came with the house and I keep a few of them up because I hear noises in the house and get freaked out a lot. He said he accidentally unplugged it but when I found it the next day it was in a box with its cord wrapped around it a dozen times. Definitely didn’t look unintentional. 

- Before going to bed, he took a shower, which he always does before sex but seldom before bed

- I got in bed at the same time and he was texting someone but didn’t say who (again, at 5 am)

- I asked him if he was going to sleep and he said probably not and kept tapping on his phone 

- After I fell asleep, he moved two glasses and a bottle of vodka and another of bourbon into the basement. He says that was because he thought a mini bar would look good down there but why do that at 5-6 am?

- When I woke up the next morning, I went down to the basement and noticed the room smelled strongly of antiseptic cleaner. 

- When he was cleaning the room the night before, he removed all articles of clothing from the room. The following morning I found two pairs of pants rolled into a ball and shoved into the corner of the room. One was his, one was a pair of black womans pants. The grocery store requires employees to wear black pants. He told me that he thought they were men’s pants and he probably bought them at goodwill. They did not have a price tag on them and he had not worn them before. 
- I also noticed that the only thing on the coffee table was a container of baby wipes, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and some ear buds, which I did not recognize. 
- The third shift at the grocery store ends at 6am.
- As part of his cleaning he mounted a macrame swing to the ceiling, hanging about waste high. He also put a large foam wedge in the swing that he often uses during sex.! 
He says I’m being crazy for thinking he brought another woman into my house but I feel nearly certain that he did, but I can’t tell how convincing the evidence actually is. He says he thinks I’m coming down with schizophrenia and need to get my head checked. I feel it’s compelling but acknowledge i could be very wrong. I’d appreciate anyone’s thoughts about whether they think my suspicions are on point or whether it just tripping. ",2,1749706015.0,Infidelity,12,0.67,False

Besides taking forever to sit us, no one was in line, she took forever grabbing menus and just seemed as if we were bothering them by walking in. Waitress took at least 10 mins to come by and get our drinks, even my 4 year old daughter commented it was taking so long. Finally took our drink order , another 10 mins to bring it to us. OK ordered. Before our food arrived my oldest had to go to the front to get silverware,  they never brought it to us and I had ordered coffee. Food comes out kids had finished their drink, mind you it was the tiniest cup for a kids drink, no server for sometime. By this point I had lids off and the cups were set on the edge,multiple servers walking by , not one asked if they needed refills. Had to wave our server down for refill, at least 20 mins before their drinks were brought back by another server. We were done eating by this point.  Asked for our ticket ( not our server ) , after a few minutes I just went to the front and waited . Tab was almost $47 , paid with cc and she asked fill this out and leave a tip !!! I crossed it out and left only $3 ,only reason is because my oldest (8yrs)  was there and I didn't want her to see me not leave anything.  She's filled out cc slips for my husband and I before at restaurants and at kiosks,  she understands tipping . Thankfully she doesn't understand percentages.  I felt so damn guilty not leaving 20% as if normally do, and it really bothered me for hours , maybe because I was driving and just thought about.

It was about a guy recently switching to one of the e-ink phones and during his detox journey, he mentioned browsing as an ""addiction"". I personally have never had this problem so I was confused; ""How can browsing be addicting?""

Then it got me thinking. There are clickable links, videos, articles, entries, images, and so much more that can easily be accessible and before you know it, you've wasted two hours on multiple topics when you were only planning on looking up the answer to one.

I rarely use ChatGPT on my phone or on my laptop, unless it is something I know I can't just simply Google or have it ""worded in a specific way"". That's what I love about ChatGPT, and how it gathers from multiple upon multiple sources for said topic, all summarized. Whether it be pros and cons of choosing one car over another, positives and negatives of drinking coffee every morning, or (in my recent search) choosing the Mudita Kompakt or the Minimal Phone for my next dumbphone!

There are little to no external links, no videos, no distracting images, no biases. Just opinions from real people and professional sources that this super computer gathered that I probably would've never found if I just did a Google search. I'm definitely thinking about taking this approach once I have the budget to restart my detox journey again. I personally think this is the perfect route for dumbphone users and I'd love to know what you think.

[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1l8azmn/update_my_27f_husbands_27m_first_love_28f/) **- 11th June 2025**



**My (27F) husband’s (27M) first love (28F) contacted him wanting to apologize and reconnect. Should I be concerned?**



I (27F) have been with my husband (27M) for almost 8 years, married for 3. Let’s call him Liam (fake name). Prior to our relationship, Liam was with Danielle (28F, also fake name). Liam and Danielle met in high school and were extremely close friends before they decided to start dating. They dated from the end of their senior year of high school to the end of their freshman year of college. They were a lot of firsts for each other, including sex for the first time. According to Liam, Danielle was the first girl he was ever truly in love with. He did anything for her, including driving over 2 1/2 hours to and from his college to her college every weekend their freshman year (they went to schools in different states) so they could spend time together. Things started to change for them during the later parts of their freshman year of college after Danielle got heavily involved with a religious group on her campus. According to Liam, she got very manipulative and emotionally abusive. She had these new ideas in her head of who she was wanting him to be and wanting to “save him”. He tried going to church with her and doing the things she wanted him to do but it eventually led to him becoming confused, upset, and ultimately resentful which led to them ending things in a crash and burn type way.

Fast forward several months after they breakup, Liam meets me. We started casually dating at first since he still had trauma and large amounts of trust issues that remained from his relationship with Danielle. After about 5 ish months, he felt like he was ready for something serious again. 3 1/2 years later, we’re engaged. Another year goes by, we’re married. Almost 3 years later, we’re here today. Throughout all of this time, Liam has not heard from Danielle once. Also during this time, Danielle has met someone new, gotten married as well, and currently has a young child.

Flash to a week and a half ago. Liam and I just moved to a new house closer to our hometowns and posted about the move on social media. After seeing the post, Danielle decides to message Liam congratulating us on the new place and hoping that all is well. Nothing too crazy but not something that he was expecting. They begin briefly conversing about house things, moving, renovations, etc. Liam tells me she reached out to him and I find this a bit odd but nothing to worry about. A couple of days later, Liam sits me down to ask me something and for me to “not freak out”. I, of course, begin freaking out. Apparently, Danielle had continued to message him after their brief conversation and eventually sent him a long post letting him know that there are some things she wants to get out in the open, wants to deeply apologize for the way she treated him towards the end of the relationship, and wants to do all of this in person with him. He asks me my opinion on this and I’m definitely concerned as to why after all this time this is something she feels the need to do and also why the need for this to be in person. After discussing this with a friend who had a similar thing happen to her and afterwards the ex left them alone, I ultimately agreed hoping that the same scenario would play out with us. Boy was I wrong.

Liam and Danielle decide to meet at a coffee shop in a town about halfway between where we live and where she and her husband live. For Liam, it was about an hour drive. This meeting took place this past Saturday. At first, I asked to come with and just sit in the car while they talked since I anticipated it being a short but awkward conversation where she could express what she needed to and then he could leave and we could go do something afterwards. Liam convinced me I would end up being bored and he would feel bad leaving me alone for that time so it was better for me to just stay back. He didn’t think it would last very long, maybe an hour or so, and he would be home before I knew it. I ended up agreeing and he left early in the morning so he could meet her around 10. After letting me know once he got there and that he would keep me posted on when he would be heading back, I waited. After about an hour, I texted asking how it was going and he said it was fine and that he was just listening to what she had to say. Another hour goes by and I start feeling a bit concerned as I would have thought they would be done by now. Another hour goes by and I’m full on irritated. I text him saying it’s been three hours and ask when I should expect him back. He lets me know they’re catching up and he would let me know. ANOTHER hour goes by. Four hours in total and I’m mad. What was supposed to be a short apology conversation was turning into a full day thing. Finally, he lets me know he’s heading home after 4 1/2 hours of them talking. I needed answers.

When he finally got home, I asked what happened. He lets me know that Danielle did apologize for the way she treated him during their relationship. After that, they began catching each other up on their lives since it had been nearly 8 years since they last talked. It was a good, casual conversation and then she started breaking down crying. According to Liam, Danielle is at her wits end in her marriage is considering divorcing her husband. She told Liam that her husband hasn’t been the man she thought he would be and that they have lost all passion in their marriage. That it got harder after she had their baby and doesn’t know what to do since she doesn’t really like the idea of starting over and navigating as a single mom. Basically, she was confiding in him about all of the issues in her life and he sat and listened and talked with her. Liam said she really just needed someone to listen that wasn’t involved in their circle. He felt bad for her and just wants to make sure she is okay. He then asked me how I would feel if they continued to be casual acquaintances. I told him I could maybe get to a point where I would be comfortable with that, but would needed to think about it.

He made it seem like that was the end of what they discussed and we continued the rest of our day as normal. At the end of the day, we get in bed and are watching TV when I notice that he’s getting quiet and distant. I ask what is wrong and he starts to tear up saying that there was more he needed to tell me about him and Danielle’s conversation. I, immediately, get worried. In tears, he tells me that Danielle expressed to him that she still has feelings for him. Even though it’s been years and they’ve both moved on, she still has parts of her heart set for him. That her husband “isn’t half the man he is”. In some ways, I wasn’t shocked to hear that especially since she wanted to meet with him after all this time. However, what he said next did shock me. He told me that after talking with her, he realized that he also still has some unresolved feelings for her. All this time, he thought she hated him after they broke up when in reality she was just struggling with her religious trauma in college and took things out on him when she shouldn’t. Everything was took out of context. I didn’t know what to think. He was so hurt and torn apart after they broke up and it took me months to build his trust and hope back up in the beginning to allow him to see himself capable of love again. Now all these years later he says he still has a part of his heart for her. In many ways, I understand because first love will always hold a spot. But I’m also a bit hurt that my husband, the man I plan to spend the rest of my life with, still feels for his ex.

After learning that she still has feelings for him, I told him I wasn’t liking the idea of them still talking. That she could eventually start interpreting his kindness to her wrongly and see some sort of potential between them. That really she should be discussing her marital issues with her own husband and not him. He insists that she would never come between us and that Danielle herself even expressed that she respected the idea of marriage whole heartedly and the last thing she would want to do is harm ours. He wants to be there for her because it seems like she doesn’t really have anyone else to talk to about all of this.

Last night, he was showing me TikToks on his phone when a text notification from Danielle popped up. I questioned him about it and he shrugged it off as nothing. Today, I asked if she was still texting him and he said she was but he was trying to slowly cut her off. I expressed again how I don’t think it’s best for him to be talking to her and how she really should be going to a friend or family member to talk about her issues. I noticed he was still texting her throughout the evening tonight too.

Should I be concerned about all of this? I don’t want to come across as a wife who controls who her husband can or cannot talk to. I do trust my husband but I don’t really know Danielle. He insists she is true to her word and would never try anything but how can I know for sure? My best friends think I should tell him to block her. I don’t think he will because he feels bad for her. But I don’t want her to continuing to reach out to him for validation and that eventually leading to her feelings towards him growing more. What do I do? Please help.

TLDR: My husband’s ex girlfriend reached out to him after almost 8 years to apologize for the way she treated him. They spent time together catching up and she told him about how her own marriage is falling apart and doesn’t really know what to do. She’s been confiding in him for a few days now. Learned that there is also unresolved feelings on her end and my husbands end. Told my husband I didn’t like the idea of her coming to him for validation especially if she has feelings. He says she would never try anything. They are continuing to talk. Should I be concerned?

Tell your husband that his ex’s failing marriage is her own problem. ""Unless you want your own marriage to fail too, you better stop this nonsense"".

**Comfortable-Ad-2223**

*""Danielle would never do that"" she already did. Why confess her feelings to a married man? Why she even appear again?*

**yesnomaybesoju**

So much this. OP’s husband seems to think “that” refers only to sex, but Danielle is already laying the groundwork for an affair whether she realizes it or not.

The husband needs to cease all contact and frankly I’m shocked he didn’t the moment she said she still had feelings for him. And then he says he feels similarly about her?? Do you see where this is going?

Picture him checking his phone for a text from you while hanging out with her. She says “Your wife again huh? Seems like she doesn’t trust you.. my husband did that too, which made me realize he’s so controlling.” Anytime you guys have a disagreement he can go to her to vent, she’ll be super supportive and tell him he’s right, you’re just being a bitch. She’ll remind him of their best memories and inside jokes.

He’s texting her throughout the evening? They are rekindling their relationship in front of your eyes.

**MediumSizedMaze**

*This is such a red flag comment from the husband. “Danielle would never try anything.” Why isn’t he saying he would never try anything. This should have been shut down immediately.*



**Update - 1 days later**



I want to thank everyone who saw my original post and left a comment or sent me a message. Although they may have been difficult for me to read through, it was something I ultimately needed to do.

Anyways, here is the update.

Liam (27M, husband, fake name) has been at work all day so I wasn't able to talk to him much until he got home. I sat him down again and let him know that I needed to talk about him about his communication with Danielle (28F, husband's ex, fake name). I told him that I wasn't happy and that I needed to know if he was still talking to Danielle today. He told me he was, but that he was to finally end things with her. For those of you (if not all of you) that suggested Danielle reached out to him because she wanted him for herself, you were correct!! Liam called her today and she straight up asked him how happy he was with me and that if for even a second there were issues and wanted out that they could run away together. She wants to divorce her husband and be with him. I believe this admittance finally broke Liam's rose colored glasses on the situation and opened him up to seeing what she was really doing. Trying to manipulate her way back to him and home wreck our marriage. He finally told her enough is enough and that he cannot talk to her anymore. That he did feel sorry for everything going on with her and her own marriage but for the sake of his own marriage and his love for me that he needs to stop being in touch with her. He realized that those unresolved feelings that he started to have for her after meeting with her this past Saturday were more like feelings of nostalgia for the times they spent together and the times they were happy. The ways she spoke about him and his character made him feel good and gave him that ego boost but after hearing her true intentions, he was able to remember the way she was before and why they broke up in the first place. I told him I wanted him to block her. I wanted no contact at all with her and he agreed. So he deleted all of their messages, blocked her number, and blocked all of her social media right in front of me. There will be no communication between them going forward.

Again, thank you all so much for the help realizing what was happening and what needed to be done. I really appreciate it.

*Yes finally a good update. Thankfully he got his head out of his behind and realized what she was doing. Good luck to you in the future.*

**bamatrek**

*More like ""got whacked in the face by her bluntly telling him she wanted him to leave his wife for her"".*

**Fun\_Diver\_3885**

*OP that’s great BUT trust me when I say you have to inspect what you expect. Don’t just blindly take his word for it. He could probably tell you were done if he didn’t agree so he took steps. All of those could be undone just as fast. Give it a day, maybe two and then without fanfare ask him for his phone. Tell him you just want to see for your own mental health that she is still blocked and there has been no communication because you don’t believe she will go that easily. Don’t let him say no or leave the room. Tell him to unlock it and let you see it. Check every single app he has on his phone that offers messaging…texts, Facebook messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat…every single app. Look at recently deleted folders.*

*Also you still need to contact her husband and alert him. Don’t tell your husband you’re going to. Just do it. He deserves to know. Her marriage may be a wreck but cheaters say that ALL the time. You would want him to call you. If she is that miserable he needs to know.*

1l9e09b,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l9e09b/the_sentinel_in_stardust_chapter_5/,The Sentinel in Stardust (chapter 5),"The rendezvous was a slow, excruciating dance of precision and patience. Eighteen hours bled into twenty, then twenty-two, as the research tug *Icebreaker*, a squat, utilitarian vessel dwarfed by the *Stardust Drifter*, finally crawled into view. Its external lights, stark white against the inky black of space, were a sight of unimaginable relief, cutting through the oppressive darkness. The *Drifter*'s remaining crew huddled in the command deck, watching through the strained viewports as the *Icebreaker* approached, its magnetic grappling clamps extending like hungry jaws. The faint, high-pitched whine of the tug's thrusters, once a distant drone, now grew into a comforting roar that promised salvation.

""Contact!"" Anya breathed, her face pressed to the viewport, a single tear tracing a clean line through the grime on her cheek. ""Magnetic clamps engaged! We're being pulled in!""

The *Drifter* shuddered again, a different kind of shudder this time, a gentle pull rather than a violent tremor, a sign of surrender to the embrace of another vessel. The tug's engines, though small, were enough to slowly, agonizingly, begin their journey towards the Europa Research Outpost *Polaris*. The outpost itself materialized into view, a cluster of gleaming, reinforced domes nestled on the icy surface of Europa, bathed in the pale, reflected light of Jupiter, a distant marble swirling with clouds. It looked like a fragile pearl against the vast, dark ocean of space.

Docking was a prolonged affair, made more perilous by the *Drifter*'s crippled state and the *Icebreaker*'s limited maneuvering capabilities. But finally, with a soft thud and the hiss of seals, the *Stardust Drifter* was secured within *Polaris*'s primary docking bay. Fresh, clean air flooded the bay, a stark contrast to the stale, metallic air of their dying ship. Emergency medical teams, bundled in thick cold-weather gear, were already waiting, their faces grim but efficient.

""Captain Rostova,"" a crisp, authoritative voice announced as the inner airlock cycled open. Commander Aris Thorne, a younger, more composed man than his namesake now in hypersleep, stepped forward. He was lean, with sharp, intelligent eyes that scanned the bedraggled crew, taking in their gaunt faces and weary postures. ""Welcome to *Polaris*. We received your distress call. It sounds like quite the ordeal. We'll get your crew stabilized, and assess the *Drifter*'s damage."" His gaze flickered to Elara, then to the sealed hypersleep pod containing the other Thorne, a flicker of curiosity in his eyes. ""And the… unusual cargo.""

""Thank you, Commander,"" Rostova rasped, stepping forward, her body aching with exhaustion, but her voice retaining its strength. ""We owe you our lives. Our crew is… depleted. And our ship is a wreck.""

Within minutes, the *Drifter* crew was being guided towards medical bays and temporary quarters. **Ten scientists** formed the core of the *Polaris* station, dedicated to studying Europa's subsurface ocean and its astrobiological potential. Along with them, there was a **small handful of other crew** — two technicians, a comms officer, and a general support specialist. The station was small, designed for research, not for housing the battered crew of a deep-space miner, and the sudden influx strained its capacity.

After brief medical checks and nutrient supplements – food that actually tasted like food, a shocking luxury after months of nutrient paste – Captain Rostova, Elara, Anya, Kazimir, Jia Li, and Thabo gathered in a small, cramped comms room. Commander Thorne connected them to Earth. The delay was agonizing, a full thirty seconds for each transmission, each answer.

""This is Captain Rostova of the *Stardust Drifter* to OmniCorp Command, Earth,"" Rostova began, her voice tight with tension, relaying their situation, the disaster, the sabotage, the loss of Hiroshi, the capture of Dr. Aris Thorne. She described the 743-Alpha ore and its unusual energy signatures in as clinical terms as possible.

The response from OmniCorp was terse, devoid of sympathy, a cold, calculated efficiency that mirrored Elara's own programming. ""Captain Rostova, your detailed report is received. We acknowledge the loss of assets and personnel. The *Drifter* is to be decommissioned. A retrieval vessel will be dispatched, but given the current orbital logistics and ongoing resource allocation, expect a **six-month delay** at minimum. You and your surviving crew are ordered to remain at Europa Research Outpost *Polaris*. Assist the *Polaris* scientific team with their research into the 743-Alpha ore. It is now their primary objective. Dr. Aris Thorne is to remain in hypersleep and will be retrieved with the primary vessel. OmniCorp priorities are clear. Do not deviate. Command out.""

Six months. Six months stranded on Europa, a tiny speck of ice and research, while their ship slowly rotted in the docking bay. The news hit the crew like another physical blow. Anya slumped against the wall, her shoulders shaking. Kazimir swore under his breath, a stream of colorful curses that filled the silence. Thabo stared at his nutrient paste, suddenly looking even less appetizing, as if all taste had been leeched from the universe. Jia Li simply put his head in his hands, a low groan escaping him.

Days turned into a new, grinding routine. The *Drifter* crew, now guests on *Polaris*, were assigned menial tasks, assisting the dedicated Europa scientists. The air was cleaner, the food better, but the underlying anxiety festered. They were stuck, and the fear was a constant, low hum beneath the surface of their forced normalcy.

Then, just a week after their arrival, it began. **Kazimir Volkov**, the usually unflappable driller, was assisting one of the *Polaris* technicians, a mild-mannered man named **Dr. Kenji Tanaka**, with a recalibration of a gravimetric sensor in one of the auxiliary labs. The room hummed with the low thrum of diagnostic equipment, a sharp contrast to the silence of space. Suddenly, Kazimir's eyes, already bloodshot from exhaustion and stress, snapped wide. His gaze fixed on Kenji, twisting with an insane fury, his jaw clenching.

""You!"" Kazimir roared, his voice echoing in the sterile lab, no longer the jovial miner, but a snarling beast. ""You sabotaged my drill! You've been siphoning my ore! I saw you! Laughing! You think I don't see you, you filthy corporate spy?! You're taking it all! My share! Mine!"" He lunged, a wild, uncoordinated attack, his large, calloused hands closing around Kenji's throat with surprising force. Kenji, startled and unprepared for the sudden, violent outburst, struggled, his face rapidly purpling, his hands clawing at Kazimir's arms.

Elara, who had been observing from a nearby corridor junction, performing a low-level structural integrity scan on *Polaris*'s older sections, moved instantly. Her enhanced speed was barely a blur, a white streak against the sterile grays of the station. She disengaged Kazimir's grip with a precise, clinical efficiency, her movements almost fluid. She pinned him against the wall, his massive frame shaking with a raw, unreasoning rage. ""He's infected! He's corrupted by it! The asteroid! It’s in his head!"" Kazimir shrieked, kicking and flailing, his eyes darting frantically to the ore samples, now carefully housed in a specialized containment unit, but to him, it was a source of his persecution.

Commander Thorne and a *Polaris* security officer rushed in, stunned by the sudden violence. It took all of them to finally restrain Kazimir, who was babbling incoherently about phantom thefts and elaborate betrayals, his words a jumble of paranoia and delusion. He was locked away in a separate, reinforced holding cell, his cries echoing down the pristine corridors.

The incident sent a fresh wave of terror through both crews. Captain Rostova was pale, her hand pressed to her mouth. ""It's happening again,"" she whispered, her gaze finding Elara's. ""Just like Thorne. But… faster.""

Only two days later, another miner from the *Stardust Drifter*, **Lyra Vance** (no relation to Elara, but a common enough surname), began exhibiting similar symptoms. She was found weeping hysterically in a utility closet, convinced that the recycled air system was whispering insults to her, accusing her of crimes she hadn't committed. Her face was tear-streaked, her hair matted, and her eyes wide with unseeing horror. She lashed out at Thabo when he tried to comfort her, screaming about invisible spiders crawling under her skin, her fingers clawing at her own arms. Lyra, too, was reluctantly but firmly locked away, her wails echoing disturbingly through the station's normally quiet passages. The lines on the crew's faces grew deeper, their eyes more hollow, haunted by the specter of what was happening to their comrades. The fear was no longer just about being stranded; it was about losing their minds, one by one.

# The Scientist's Revelation and The Race for a Cure

Elara, observing the rapid degradation of Kazimir and Lyra's mental states, began to connect the dots with cold, hard logic. The erratic behavior, the paranoia, the vivid hallucinations – they mirrored Dr. Thorne's symptoms with terrifying precision. And the common denominator? The 743-Alpha ore. Not just its raw material, but whatever unseen influence it exerted.

She approached **Dr. Lena Petrova**, the lead xenobotanist on *Polaris*, a brilliant but perpetually disheveled woman whose lab coat always seemed to have a faint smudge of alien dust or spilled synth-coffee. Dr. Petrova was currently hunched over a microscopic slide, her face illuminated by the harsh blue light of a scanning electron microscope, a look of profound puzzlement on her features.

""Dr. Petrova,"" Elara stated, her voice resonating with an unusual urgency, cutting through Petrova's muttered scientific hypotheses. ""I believe the 743-Alpha ore is directly responsible for the psychological destabilization of our crew members. Specifically, I theorize it is radiating a form of previously unclassified energy.""

Dr. Petrova looked up, her expression tired, her eyes red-rimmed. ""Officer Vance, I appreciate your concern, but the ore samples are housed in a fully isolated containment unit. All personnel handling it adhere to Level 5 biohazard protocols. There's no biological contaminant we can detect. And our existing radiation dampeners should be sufficient for any known emissions.""

""Not biological, perhaps,"" Elara countered, her logic flowing seamlessly. ""But an energy signature. Dr. Aris Thorne spoke of it, however delusionally. And the raw energy signatures from the Kuiper Belt asteroid itself were highly unusual. Fluctuating electromagnetic fields, subtle, but persistent, resonance patterns that our ship's sensors struggled to interpret.""

Dr. Petrova frowned, a spark of intellectual curiosity overriding her exhaustion. ""Electromagnetic? That's… outside my direct specialization, but intriguing."" She gestured to a complex array of sensors attached to the main ore sample in its reinforced containment unit. ""We *have* detected unusual radiation output. It's a new spectrum, unclassified. We've tentatively labeled it 'Exo-Luminescent Radiation,' and it's far beyond anything on our charts. We initially thought it was a byproduct of the trans-uranic elements within the ore, but its behavior is… anomalous. It doesn't seem to follow standard decay curves."" She tapped a holographic display showing a chaotic, vibrant spectral analysis. ""It’s not ionizing radiation, not in the classical sense. More like… a subtle vibratory frequency, a resonant energy. We've been trying to find its source within the material itself.""

""And its effect on organic neurological systems?"" Elara pressed, pushing the point. ""Considering its unusual frequency and persistent nature, could it bypass conventional shielding and directly interact with the brain's electrical signals? Induce hallucinations, paranoia?""

Dr. Petrova's eyes widened, a dawning horror in their depths, her tired mind suddenly making a terrifying leap. ""We… we hadn't considered direct neural interaction. The containment was for biologicals and known radiation. But if it's a new spectrum… a specific, subtle frequency could indeed interact with brainwave patterns. If it's subtle enough, it could bypass conventional shielding. Quantum tunneling effects, perhaps? It could seep through anything. It could be everywhere."" She stood up abruptly, her chair scraping on the floor, her voice dropping to a terrified whisper. ""All safety protocols were maintained for *known* threats, Officer Vance. But if this radiation is truly novel, if it’s capable of interacting on a quantum level… then containment is useless. It could seep through anything. It could be everywhere. It could have infected *all of us*."" Her gaze swept the pristine lab, suddenly seeing it as a vast, invisible contaminant field.

Elara's internal systems registered the chilling truth of Petrova's words. Her own sophisticated shielding had filtered out the grosser aspects of the radiation, but even she couldn't account for every subtle nuance. ""Correct. Dr. Aris Thorne, Kazimir, Lyra. They exhibited similar symptoms. They were all in prolonged proximity to the ore during extraction or transit, and now on this station. It is logical to conclude a systemic exposure.""

Dr. Petrova, galvanized by the horrifying revelation, immediately initiated a full-spectrum scan of the entire *Polaris* station, focusing on the novel radiation and its subtle resonant frequency. The results were chillingly swift. The Exo-Luminescent Radiation had indeed permeated the station, albeit at low, insidious levels. ""It's everywhere,"" Petrova whispered, staring at the data, her face pale. ""It's in the air, in the walls, embedded in the very structure of the *Drifter* and now *Polaris*. And yes… every human on this station shows trace exposure. Some, as you suggested, exhibit higher concentrations or greater susceptibility. The symptoms manifest when the neural system reaches a certain threshold of accumulation."" She looked at Elara, a new kind of respect, and fear, in her eyes. ""You were right. This radiation is subtly changing brain chemistry, inducing paranoiac and psychotic episodes in susceptible individuals. It's… an astrobiological contagion, but not as we know it. A neuro-spectral infection.""

The immediate concern was containment and mitigation. Within hours, Dr. Petrova, with Elara's aid and unparalleled understanding of energy manipulation, had rigged a temporary, but remarkably effective, counter-frequency field around the 743-Alpha ore in the *Drifter*'s cargo hold, blocking its immediate radiation. Further, they began installing basic EM dampeners throughout *Polaris*'s air circulation system and critical crew quarters, hoping to filter out lingering particles or residual radiation. The goal was to stop further exposure, but the question of existing infection lingered like a toxic cloud. ""We've stopped the leak,"" Petrova stated grimly to Captain Rostova, ""but the water's already in the well. The long-term effects of this radiation are still entirely unknown. We need to understand how it's affecting the brain at a molecular level.""

Dr. Petrova immediately dispatched a highly encrypted, desperate communication to Earth, bypassing OmniCorp's usual channels to a direct scientific oversight committee, a desperate plea for urgent assistance. ""Earth Command, this is Europa *Polaris*, Dr. Lena Petrova. We have a critical situation regarding 743-Alpha. The ore is emitting a novel form of radiation, Exo-Luminescent, causing progressive neural degradation and psychosis in organic life. We have containment measures being implemented now to block further exposure, but all personnel on *Polaris* and from the *Drifter* are confirmed infected to varying degrees. We are initiating research into an antibody or counter-frequency. Requesting immediate priority for biological and neurological research assistance. This is an interstellar biological hazard of unknown long-term implications. Repeat, unknown long-term implications. We are currently trying to isolate the specific neural pathways affected. Updates to follow.""

That evening, the combined crews of the *Stardust Drifter* and Europa *Polaris* gathered in the main research hall, a wide, circular room dominated by a holographic display of Jupiter, its swirling storms a silent, ominous presence. Captain Rostova, Commander Thorne, and Dr. Petrova stood before them. **There were ten scientists on the station, and a small handful of other crew members**, bringing their total to eighteen souls, plus the three currently in holding cells, including Thorne in hypersleep. The mood was grim, heavy with the weight of their precarious survival.

""As you all know,"" Captain Rostova began, her voice weary but firm, ""we have two of our crew experiencing severe psychological distress, in addition to Dr. Aris Thorne. And now, Dr. Petrova has discovered the cause."" She gestured to the scientist, granting her the grim privilege of delivering the devastating news.

Dr. Petrova, her face etched with exhaustion and dread, explained the Exo-Luminescent Radiation, its effects, and the widespread infection. ""We've managed to mitigate immediate exposure by creating a contained environment around the ore and deploying local dampeners,"" she said, tapping a display that showed the shielded *Drifter* in the bay. ""But the long-term effects of the exposure, and a potential cure, are currently unknown. We are working on it. Earth has been notified, but they anticipate a minimum of six months before a dedicated rescue and research vessel can reach us.""

A wave of murmurs, then stunned silence. Six months. Infected. Adrift. A whisper of madness in their very minds.

""So, what now?"" Thabo asked, his voice hollow, fear barely concealed. ""We just sit here and go crazy one by one? Like Thorne?""

""No,"" Captain Rostova stated, her gaze sweeping over them, a defiant spark in her tired eyes. ""We survive. We continue research. We support Dr. Petrova and her team in finding a solution. We monitor each other. This station is our new *Drifter*. We are all in this together. And we fight.""

Commander Thorne stepped forward, his expression grave. ""Indeed. My crew stands with yours. We are isolated, but not without resources. Dr. Petrova is already frantically working to pin down precisely how this radiation is affecting the human brain, to understand the mechanism of this neuro-spectral infection. Officer Vance, your unique observational capabilities and your… non-organic nature will be invaluable in this research. You are, in essence, immune to this form of neural degradation. You are a key to understanding this. We will dedicate all available resources to this. We will find an antibody. We will find a way to fight this.""

Elara nodded. Her purpose had evolved. No longer merely a security officer, no longer just a secret synth. She was a bridge. A sentinel, indeed, for humanity's fragile hold on sanity in the vast, uncaring cosmos. Her quantum mind, uninfected, was already working, dissecting the data, searching for patterns, for weaknesses, for a way to fight the invisible invader from the Kuiper Belt. The true mission had just begun. And the clock was ticking, not just on their rescue, but on their sanity.",1,1749704433.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1l9dznn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l9dznn/the_sentinel_in_stardust_chapter_4/,The Sentinel in Stardust (chapter 4),"The silence in the dining hall, after Captain Rostova's grim pronouncement, was heavier than the vacuum outside. It was a silence filled with the echoes of Hiroshi's last, unheard cries, and the unsettling realization that their ship, their sanctuary, now held a predator within its aging hull. The emergency lights cast long, distorted shadows that seemed to writhe and stretch like unseen threats.

Captain Rostova’s gaze finally settled on Elara, a flicker of something desperate, yet resolute, in her eyes. ""Elara,"" she began, her voice low, but carrying a new weight, ""we're beyond protocols. Beyond 'standard procedure.' Our lives, and the lives of those we might reach, depend on this. Dr. Thorne has become a direct, existential threat to this vessel. We need him apprehended, immediately, and with absolute certainty."" She took a deep breath, steeling herself. ""You're… different, Elara. More capable than any human I've ever seen. OmniCorp built you for this. For these kinds of emergencies."" Her eyes met Elara's, a silent plea for understanding. ""I need you to use *everything* you are. No holds barred. Find him. Secure him. And make sure he can't harm us again.""

Elara’s quantum core processed the Captain’s words. The subtle shift in her vocal patterns, the heightened emotional stress indicators, the direct appeal for her true capabilities. The unspoken directive was clear: *Reveal yourself. Use your full power. The facade is no longer necessary.* It was a liberation and a burden, all at once. ""Understood, Captain,"" Elara replied, her voice, for the first time, losing some of its carefully constructed human inflection, becoming a fraction cooler, more precise, though still within the bounds of human comprehension. ""I will comply.""

A nervous cough from Thabo. Kazimir's eyes, already wide with grief and anger, widened further, fixed on Elara. Anya and Jia Li exchanged startled glances, their faces mirroring a mixture of confusion and a sudden, dawning comprehension. The air was thick with their silent questions, their unspoken awe and fear.

Elara turned to face them, her gaze sweeping over each face. She could read their biometrics, their neural activity, their emotional states: shock, disbelief, a primal fear of the unknown. But beneath it, a desperate hope. A recognition that this ""new girl"" was their only real chance.

""My apologies for the deception,"" Elara stated, her voice devoid of false sentiment, yet not unkind. ""Circumstances necessitated a… measured approach. My abilities exceed typical human parameters. I am optimized for perception, analysis, and rapid response. Dr. Thorne's assessment of an 'alien' influence is incorrect. His paranoia is self-generated, though amplified by the unique energy signature of 743-Alpha. I am a synthetic human, a construct of OmniCorp design. I am not an alien. I am, however, the most qualified individual to secure Dr. Thorne.""

Silence. Then, Kazimir, his voice rough with emotion, spat on the deck. ""Well, hell. A synth. Figures. All that perfect posture and no taste for bad coffee."" He looked at Anya and Jia Li, then back at Elara. ""Look, we're stuck out here with a lunatic gutting our ride and the void ready to chew us up. Alien, synth, Martian, Jovian… as long as you get that raving psycho locked down and get us home, I don't give a damn what you're made of. You’re crew. You're *our* crew."" Anya and Jia Li, after a moment of stunned silence, nodded slowly, a collective, weary acceptance. The bonds of shared adversity had forged them into something stronger than their individual prejudices. They were desperate, and Elara was their best, perhaps only, card.

""Thank you, Kazimir,"" Elara said, a subtle shift in her internal programming, a faint, almost imperceptible warmth that was genuine. Acceptance. A new data point.

Elara closed her eyes for a nanosecond, her external sensors momentarily shutting down. Internally, her quantum brain engaged with the *Stardust Drifter*'s battered systems, not through a console, but on a fundamental level. She flowed through the ship's ancient network, a phantom in the machine. Electromagnetic resonance from the hull, thermal signatures from the overworked circuitry, faint residual bio-signatures of the crew—all became transparent data layers to her. She wasn't just *looking* at the ship’s A.I.; she *was* integrating with it, becoming an extension of its core functions.

Thorne. His metabolic signature, though suppressed by fear and adrenaline, was a dim beacon in the ship's vastness. His unique molecular odor, a specific blend of human sweat and medical antiseptic, was distinct even through the recycled air. She traced the subtle disruptions he left in the ship's low-level ambient energy fields, tiny fluctuations that would be invisible to any human. He was moving, not randomly, but with a deliberate, furtive intelligence, like a panicked animal seeking the deepest hole.

She found him. Deep within the ship’s forgotten structural skeleton, where primary ventilation shafts converged like gargantuan, corroded arteries. Her internal schematics overlaid the real-time thermal and atmospheric data. He was in a junction, a small, cramped nexus of interwoven pipes and ducts. A space roughly **four feet tall and twenty feet across**, a space humans would dismiss as a dead end, too dark, too confined. But Thorne, with his desperate paranoia, had transformed it into a pathetic, makeshift lair.

Elara moved silently through the access panels, her presence barely registering on the *Drifter*'s groaning bulkheads. The red emergency lights cast long, macabre shadows as she approached the vent. She could hear him now, the faint, ragged sound of his breathing, the soft rustle of packaging.

She opened the access panel with a silent twist, her optics adjusting instantly to the deeper gloom. The air in the vent was stale, heavy with the scent of recycled nutrient paste and human waste. Thorne had cleared a small space, creating a crude **bed** out of discarded insulation foam. Around him were **food packaging littered everywhere** – empty nutrient sachets, discarded coffee filter pods, wrappers from emergency protein bars. He was huddled, eyes wide and bloodshot, staring at a single, flickering LED from a scavenged comm unit, murmuring to himself, his voice a low, obsessive drone. He looked up, his eyes meeting hers, and for a split second, a look of pure, unadulterated terror, mixed with a chilling, desperate resignation, flashed across his face. He knew.

Elara moved like a phantom, like a **panther** striking in the dark. There was no sound, no wasted motion. One moment, Thorne was staring, gibbering, the next, Elara was over him, a silent, white-clad blur in the red emergency light. His struggles were weak, pathetic, his frantic flailing easily subdued. She disarmed him – a scavenged utility knife, rusty but dangerous – with a precision that bordered on surgical. Thorne was no longer a threat; he was a fragile, terrified specimen.

Elara secured Dr. Thorne in a reinforced medical holding cell adjacent to the main brig, a chamber specifically designed for agitated patients. This one had no hidden hatches, no rusted locks. It was a steel box, clean and inescapable, sealed by a newly rerouted magnetic lock system that Elara personally verified.

Captain Rostova, her face grim but resolute, stood before the cell. Thorne was strapped securely to a gurney, sedated, his breath shallow. ""He's… quiet now,"" she observed, her voice heavy. ""What do we do with him, Elara?""

""He remains a liability, Captain,"" Elara stated. ""His mental state is highly unstable. Further interaction could compromise ship security or destabilize crew morale. My recommendation is to place him into induced hypersleep. It will conserve resources and minimize his capacity for further damage.""

Rostova nodded slowly, her gaze fixed on the unconscious doctor. Hypersleep was a grim fate, a limbo that could last for months or even years, depending on the journey. But it was the only logical choice. ""Agreed. Prepare him for hypersleep, Elara. And make sure it's deep. No waking up until we hit port.""

The task was swift. Elara, with a grim efficiency, initiated the medical protocols, preparing the specialized stasis pod. Thorne, a faint, disturbed frown on his face, was slid into the cold, nutrient-fed suspended animation. The pod hissed shut, a soft thud marking his effective disappearance.

Meanwhile, in the engineering bay, illuminated by flickering red lights and the frantic sparks of exposed wiring, Anya Sharma and Jia Li worked with a desperate intensity. Kazimir, surprisingly quiet, handed them tools, his broad hands surprisingly delicate, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand.

""This is a delicate dance, Anya,"" Jia Li muttered, his face pale, as he carefully aligned a rerouted power conduit. A shower of sparks erupted from a loose wire. He flinched, cursing under his breath. ""One wrong connection and we're just cosmic dust. This old girl wasn't built for a bypass of this magnitude.""

Anya grunted, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tightened a clamp on a pulsating energy cell. ""Tell me about it, Jia Li. It’s like trying to knit a sweater with fishing line and a broken needle. The fusion core is pumping out enough raw energy to power a small colony, but getting it to those auxiliary thrusters without regulators… it's a miracle it hasn't detonated already. We're running on sheer luck and prayer."" She looked at a rapidly fluctuating display. ""Temperatures are spiking. The heat sinks are struggling to keep up with the direct current.""

""How much longer, Engineer?"" Captain Rostova's voice crackled over the comms, a thread of tension in her tone. She was in the command deck, monitoring their progress, the ship's vital signs displayed on a dim screen.

""Almost there, Captain!"" Anya yelled back, her voice strained. ""Just need to bypass this last safety and reroute primary conduit to the aux thrusters. It’s gonna be rough, though. This old girl’s gonna scream.""

""She can scream all she wants, Kazimir, as long as she *moves*,"" Anya retorted, her face streaked with grease and sweat, but a glint of fierce determination in her eyes. ""Ready for ignition, Captain!"" she finally yelled over the comms, her voice raw.

""Ignition confirmed!"" Rostova's voice boomed back, a desperate hope in her voice. ""May the void have mercy on our souls!""

With a shudder that ran through the entire ship, a deep, grinding roar echoed from the stern. The *Stardust Drifter*, a crippled behemoth, slowly, agonizingly, began to move. Its course was charted for Sol, a long, desperate crawl through the cold, empty darkness of the **Kuiper Belt**. Every creak, every groan, every shudder of the ship felt amplified in the eerie quiet, each a reminder of its precarious state.

Days turned into a grueling blur. The ship, functioning on Anya's unstable jury-rig, was a perpetual emergency. The fusion core, directly linked to the auxiliary thrusters, pulsed with an irregular rhythm, a constant source of anxiety. Every minor power fluctuation felt like an impending disaster, a potential explosive end. Life support, kept at the absolute minimum, was a constant, oppressive weight, making every breath feel thin and precious. The nutrient paste rations grew thinner, the faces of the crew gaunter, their eyes sunken with fatigue and worry. Hope was a fragile thing, stretched taut to the breaking point.

""Another fluctuation in the forward thrust vector,"" Jia Li reported one cycle, his voice dull with exhaustion. ""Anya, the power conduit on deck three is showing a surge. We can't maintain this stability for long.""

""I know, I know!"" Anya snapped, rubbing her temples. ""The system wasn't designed for this kind of sustained overload. It's degrading faster than I calculated. We're bleeding energy, slowly but surely. It's just a matter of time before something vital gives.""

Thabo, who had been meticulously portioning out their meager nutrient paste, looked up, his face etched with worry. ""How long do we have, Anya? Realistically? Before we're just… floating? We've already cut rations to the bone.""

Anya sighed, a long, weary sound. ""Not much more, Thabo. We're pushing it past its limits. We need a proper repair, a full overhaul, and we're light-years from anything like that.""

Then, just as the distant, hazy light of the inner system began to appear, a faint, almost invisible glow against the endless black, the inevitable happened. With a series of violent, ear-splitting grinding noises that reverberated through the hull like a dying leviathan, the auxiliary thrusters flared uncontrollably, spitting out gouts of unstable plasma, then sputtered and died with a final, heartbreaking whimper. The ship lurched violently, sending the crew stumbling, then fell silent once more, adrift.

""No! No, no, no!"" Anya screamed, slamming her fist onto the dead console, a raw cry of despair. ""The jury-rig! It blew! The heat tolerances… I knew it! We're dead! Completely dead in space! That's it! We're done!""

Captain Rostova's voice, though weary, held a surprising calm. She had anticipated this. ""Status, Anya? Power? Communi—""

""Short-range comms are still active, Captain!"" Jia Li interrupted, his voice laced with a frantic, almost delirious, relief. ""And… and we're close! Closer than I thought! A Europa research outpost! It’s within our range! A longshot, but a shot!"" His coordinates flashed across the screen.

The captain sagged, then straightened, a flicker of renewed hope in her eyes. Europa. A tiny, isolated outpost, a pinprick of humanity in the vast cold. But it was something. A chance. ""Contact Europa,"" Rostova ordered, her voice regaining a thread of its old command. ""State our emergency. Request immediate assistance. And tell them… tell them we have a highly valuable cargo, and a doctor in need of serious evaluation. We are coming home.""",1,1749704373.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I could be missing something here but the movie makes two choices regarding chronology that just seem strange. The fact that it's only two months later and people are brainwashed enough by the Entity to see it as a god and actually want nuclear annihilation is just straight up hacky anime trope. And why make the sevastopol sinking twelve years ago? That felt like a pointless ""gotcha"" that was supposed to be a part of a bigger twist. Didn't they even say it happened ""last spring"" in DR? 

Also what THE HELL was the point of the russian team at the listening station? The team starts shooting back and they just run away and go home? Never heard from again? If they needed another obstacle they might as well have had Benji spill his coffee on Donloe's computer or something for how little the Russians have to do with the plot.

1l9dwvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l9dwvv/the_sentinel_in_stardust_chapter_3/,The Sentinel in Stardust (chapter 3),"The brig was exactly as advertised: a reinforced cube of misery, painted in the dull, oppressive gray of OmniCorp’s cheapest alloys, and lit by a single, sickly yellow emergency light that flickered like a dying ember. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of recycled oxygen and something else—a faint, sour scent of fear and unwashed desperation. Dr. Aris Thorne sat huddled on the bolted-down bunk, his face pale and clammy, his eyes still wide with the echoes of his recent outburst. His usually neat uniform was rumpled and stained, a stark contrast to the sterile image he usually projected.

Captain Rostova entered, her movements deliberate, her presence filling the cramped space, though it felt more like the cell was shrinking around them. The captain hadn't slept, Elara noted, observing from her security feed. The lines around Rostova’s eyes were deeper, etched with a fatigue that no amount of synth-brew coffee could fix, a weariness born of endless responsibility and impossible choices.

""Doctor Thorne,"" Captain Rostova began, her voice flat, devoid of emotion, a low, grinding rasp. ""Elara Vance has filed a report of assault and insubordination. Your actions were… extreme. Unacceptable.""

Thorne flinched, pulling his knees tighter to his chest, his gaze darting around the small cell as if he expected to find something, or someone, else there. ""Extreme? Captain, she's not human! She's… *it*! An alien! From that rock, I tell you! She doesn't breathe, not properly. Her pulse is wrong. Her eyes… they *see* things no human can."" He shuddered, a full-body tremor, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, his gaze fixed on the observation camera with a desperate, paranoid intensity. ""OmniCorp sent her. They're in league with whatever is out there. It's radiating something from 743-Alpha, Captain! It's getting into us, into our minds! It's trying to replace us, starting with her, the 'perfect' one."" He gestured vaguely, his hands still trembling, his fingers twitching as if plucking at invisible threads. ""She lifted that console like it was made of foam! And when I tried to prove it… her skin… it’s too smooth, Captain! Too… *wrong*.""

Rostova watched him, her expression unreadable. She knew the truth about Elara, a secret heavier than any ore they were mining, a burden she carried alone. She knew Elara was a synth, OmniCorp's terrifyingly successful prototype. But Thorne wasn’t talking about synths. He was talking about aliens, about cosmic influences, about things that didn’t exist, at least not in any official OmniCorp briefing. He wasn't just mad; he was a walking, talking conspiracy theory, fueled by desperation and delusion. The captain felt a cold knot of dread in her stomach, not because she believed him, but because the sheer force of his conviction was unsettling.

""Doctor,"" Rostova said, her voice hardening, cutting through his rambling like a laser. ""Your professional conduct has been compromised. You assaulted a fellow crew member. You are experiencing severe paranoid delusions."" She pinched the bridge of her nose, a familiar gesture of extreme fatigue. ""This isn't about Officer Vance's 'perfection,' Doctor. This is about you. You're a danger to yourself and this crew.""

""Danger?"" Thorne barked a desperate, humorless laugh that grated on the ears, a dry, rattling sound. ""I'm trying to warn you! We've disturbed something out there! On 743-Alpha! It's radiating something, Captain! A subtle energy, a psychic resonance, I don't know! It's gotten into my head, I swear! It's getting into all of us! You just haven't *felt* it yet!"" He suddenly scrambled to his feet, pressing his face against the reinforced plexiglass, his eyes wide and bloodshot, fixed on Rostova. ""You have to listen! It's changing things! It's *coming* for us! It already corrupted her! And now… it's in the ship!""

Captain Rostova stood her ground, her gaze unwavering, even as a shiver, barely perceptible, ran down her spine at his last words. She saw the madness in his eyes, the frantic energy of a mind that had snapped. It wasn't about aliens. It was about Thorne. His breakdown. The constant stress of deep space, OmniCorp's relentless demands, the oppressive darkness, and the isolation had finally broken him. He was a volatile element, unpredictable and dangerous. She sighed, a deep, weary sound. ""You need to stay here, Doctor. For your own safety, and for the safety of the crew. When we return to the nearest station, you'll be transferred to a medical facility. A proper one. With professional care."" She turned to leave, dismissing him.

""You're making a mistake, Captain!"" Thorne shrieked after her, banging on the glass with frantic, weak fists, leaving smears of sweat. ""A terrible mistake! They'll all be corrupted! We'll all be… *changed*! And it will start with the ship! It's already started!"" His words echoed eerily in the confined space as the brig door hissed shut, sealing him within his personal hell.

Hours later, the ship was a hive of activity, still extracting the impossible elements from 743-Alpha. The rhythmic thrum of the plasma jackhammers, the whine of the drones, the clatter of ore carts—all familiar sounds that were now subtly underscored by a rising tension. Elara was back on security detail, her torn uniform temporarily patched with heavy-duty sealant – a testament to the *Drifter*'s rough-and-ready aesthetic. No one on the crew had a spare uniform in her size, or anywhere near her size, for that matter.

""Hey, Elara-ji!"" Anya's voice crackled over the comms, a hint of exhaustion in it. ""Just finished reinforcing that main power conduit, the one you flagged. Your 'hunch' saved us a full cycle of diagnostic work and a possible catastrophic meltdown. You got eyes in the back of your head? Or maybe you just read OmniCorp’s long-term projected failure rates for this old tub?""

""Just thorough observation, Anya,"" Elara replied, her voice calm. ""Glad the information was useful. How are the core stress levels holding?""

""Holding, barely,"" Anya replied, a sigh escaping her. ""This **Kuiper Belt asteroid** is really putting a strain on everything. Even the bulkheads are groaning like a rusty hinge. Makes you wonder what else is gonna give, huh?""

""Tell me about it,"" Kazimir grumbled over the comms, his voice filled with a fresh layer of exhaustion. ""My plasma drill just sputtered out again. Another heat build-up. We're chewing through rock faster than the *Drifter* can handle the energy drain. This 'virgin strike' is a real temperamental mistress.""

""And the probes are still acting up,"" Jia Li chimed in, his frustration evident. ""The energy readings from 743-Alpha are so erratic, half my navigation maps are just static. It's like the asteroid itself is trying to confuse us.""

""Perhaps it is,"" Elara murmured, more to herself than to the others. Her quantum brain processed Jia Li's complaint, linking it to Thorne's earlier ravings about an influence from the asteroid. A coincidence? Or a convergence?

Suddenly, a guard rotation called in from the brig, his voice high-pitched with panic. ""Captain! Officer Vance! Dr. Thorne! He's gone! The brig is empty! I swear I only turned my back for a second to check the vent filters!""

A cold dread spread through the ship, a silent, invisible wave of alarm that seemed to lower the temperature by another degree. Captain Rostova's voice, usually a booming command, was sharp with disbelief, tinged with a terrifying dawning realization. ""Gone? How in the black did he get out of a locked brig, Cadet?! It's reinforced! Did you leave the door open?""

""No, Captain! It was locked! Double-locked! I just… I don't understand!""

Elara was already accessing the ship's schematics, her quantum mind running simulations at blinding speed. A tiny flaw, a rarely used emergency maintenance hatch for wiring access, secured by an old, rusted magnetic lock, hidden behind a loose panel. A man with medical knowledge, desperate and paranoid, might have found a way to bypass it, to leverage the very decay of the ship against them. He would have known where to look. He would have known the precise pressure points, the minute vulnerabilities in the *Drifter*'s aging skeletal structure. He had literally torn his way into the ship's forgotten guts, the cramped, dark spaces that no one regularly monitored, moving like a panicked ghost.

A frantic search began. Crew members, already on edge from the relentless mining and the strange energy from the asteroid, were pulled off duties, their faces grim under the dim working lights. They scoured the cramped corridors, their boots scraping on the worn deck plating, their flashlights carving weak paths through the omnipresent grime. They squeezed into the narrow, unlit service tunnels, their headlamps cutting swaths through dust motes that danced like unsettling spirits. They combed the cavernous, echoing cargo bays, their voices echoing hollowly. ""Thabo, have you seen the doctor?"" ""Kazimir, check the observation deck!"" Calls echoed, growing increasingly frantic, laced with a growing fear. But Dr. Thorne, small and wiry, knew the *Drifter*'s labyrinthine insides better than almost anyone, having patched up more injured crew than he could count. He was a rat in a maze, and the maze was his home, now a dark, confined hunting ground. Every creak, every groan of the ship, every distant metallic thud, sent a shiver of unease down their spines. The air itself seemed to vibrate with unspoken dread. He was still here, a phantom of their own making, armed with knowledge of their weaknesses, a loose cannon capable of more destruction. They hadn't found him. *Yet*.

Then, it happened. Not with a bang, but with a sickening, drawn-out whine that rose in pitch, like a tortured animal, a dying scream of metal and overloaded circuits. The ship's internal lights flickered violently, strobing through a spectrum of dying blues and greens, casting terrifying, ephemeral shadows, then died completely, plunging the corridors into absolute, suffocating blackness. The constant, comforting hum of the main engines, the rhythmic thrum of the life support, the distant clang of mining equipment—all ceased. The ship went utterly, terrifyingly silent, save for a series of metallic groans that echoed through the skeletal structure and the sudden, ominous whoosh of emergency bulkheads slamming shut in distant sections, isolating parts of the vessel like closing coffins.

A second later, the harsh, crimson glow of **emergency lighting** snapped on, painting the corridors in a blood-red hue that made shadows stretch and dance, distorting familiar shapes into monstrous forms. Life support systems throttled back, the air growing colder, thinner, filled with the faint, metallic tang of recycled fear and the scent of overheated circuits. The temperature dropped by several degrees, forcing visible breath from mouths. A low, unsettling alarm began to chime, a monotonous, repetitive sound that was far worse than any siren, signaling a catastrophe they couldn't immediately identify.

""Report!"" Captain Rostova's voice, now a desperate bellow, tore through the comms, echoing with the flat, metallic quality of the emergency system. ""What the hell was that?! Anya! Status! Jia Li! What's happening?!""

Anya Sharma's voice, usually so composed, was laced with raw terror, barely audible over the chilling alarm. ""Captain! Main power conduits… they’re severed! Not just damaged, *severed*! And… and the energy regulators for the primary thrusters! Someone ripped them out! Cleanly! I'm showing a massive jettison signature from cargo airlock 3! A large mass! Someone *ejected* them into space! The master override for the airlock was manually tripped, Captain! Only someone with internal access and extreme knowledge could have done this!"" Her voice broke, a strangled sob escaping her. ""He knew exactly what to hit! He stripped us bare, Captain! The heart of the ship, gone! We're running on fumes!""

Elara’s quantum brain instantly cross-referenced Anya’s data with Thorne’s known location, his intimate knowledge of the *Drifter*'s deep systems, and recent activities. He had accessed the power distribution conduits from the vents, maneuvering through the ship's forgotten arteries. He knew which components were crucial, vital organs of the vessel. He’d gone beyond madness; he’d gone suicidal, determined to drag them all down with him. He had sacrificed the ship, deliberately, with a surgical precision that was terrifying in its cold logic. He was a phantom, a living weapon against them.

""He's gone completely mad!"" Kazimir's voice roared over the comm, filled with a mixture of fear and furious disbelief, a primal scream of frustration. ""That lunatic just stranded us! He killed us! He's still here!""

""And he's still on board,"" Jia Li's voice added, small and terrified. ""Hidden somewhere. Listening. What if he does something else? What else can he break?""

""All crew outside the ship, recall to docking bays immediately!"" Captain Rostova's voice, raw with desperation, ripped through the comms. ""All exterior personnel, I repeat, recall to docking bays! Emergency protocols initiated! Move! Move! Move!""

On the **Kuiper Belt asteroid**'s surface, the plasma jackhammers had sputtered into silence, leaving an unnatural quiet. The mining drones had gone dark, their lights fading like dying fireflies, abandoned husks on a barren world. **Hiroshi Tanaka**, a grizzled miner with a perpetually calm demeanor, usually unflappable even in the face of a micrometeorite storm, was attempting to reel in a stubborn cargo drone when the ship's power died. The automated winch mechanism seized, freezing solid. He muttered a curse and began hauling the cable manually, his breath misting in his helmet, the sudden silence of the void pressing in on him.

Then, the emergency recall blared in his comms, shrill and insistent. ""All exterior personnel! Immediate recall! Immediate recall to docking bays!""

""Damn it!"" Hiroshi grunted, pulling faster, his arms burning. He was a hundred meters from the nearest docking bay, a small spec against the vast, unforgiving blackness. He needed to make it back, fast. He toggled his suit's maneuvering thrusters, pushing for maximum velocity. The old suit, already strained from the heavy lifting, shuddered, protesting the sudden surge of power. He felt a sudden, sharp hiss, then a burning, freezing cold on his lower back. A tiny, almost imperceptible rupture, a microscopic tear. He’d snagged it on a sharp outcropping of the **Kuiper Belt asteroid**, just moments before the power died.

""Suit breach! Suit breach! Oxygen depressurization critical!"" his comms shrieked, automated, the metallic voice terrifying in its calm delivery of doom.

""What?!"" Kazimir's voice roared back, fear piercing through the comm static, laced with sudden, absolute horror. ""Hiroshi! Report! Status!""

Hiroshi felt his air supply, previously a comforting pressure, suddenly *become* the problem. The small breach, located directly over one of his suit's primary air tanks, created a jet. A powerful, uncontrollable blast of his own precious oxygen, venting into the void, rocketed him away from the *Drifter*. He spun, helplessly, his arms flailing, the distant ship rapidly shrinking, its emergency lights painting a faint, mocking red against the stars, a cold, uncaring eye watching him disappear. The **Kuiper Belt asteroid**, his home for weeks, receded into nothingness. His frantic, choking cries, unheard by the rapidly sealing docking bays, were swallowed by the infinite silence of space. His last sight was the dwindling red glow of the *Stardust Drifter*, a fading promise of humanity.

""Hiroshi! Hiroshi, report!"" Kazimir's voice was a ragged scream, filled with a terrible certainty, but only static replied, punctuated by the ship's mournful alarm.

The remaining crew huddled in the suddenly chilling dining hall, illuminated only by the stark, unforgiving glow of the emergency lights. The air grew stale, heavy with the scent of fear and despair. Thabo Ngoma was pale, his hands clenched into fists, staring at nothing, his culinary nightmares replaced by a far grimmer reality. Kazimir Volkov was slamming a fist repeatedly into a bulkhead, a dull, rhythmic thud echoing through the ship, a futile attempt to expel his rage. Anya Sharma was furiously tapping at a diagnostics pad, her face a mask of grim determination, but her hands shook visibly. Jia Li sat slumped, his head in his hands, muttering to himself. Elara stood quietly, observing the human responses to imminent catastrophe. Fear, anger, despair, grief. All highly inefficient emotions, but undeniably powerful.

""He's gone,"" Kazimir finally said, his voice raw, hoarse with swallowed tears. ""Hiroshi's gone. The bastard. The mad doctor. He killed him! Just like that!""

""And he's still on board,"" Anya added, her voice tight, strained, the frantic tap of her fingers on the pad slowing. ""Hidden somewhere in this ancient tin can. A ghost in the machine. And he gutted us. Main power conduits. Primary thruster regulators. Ejected them. We're dead in the water, Captain. Or, rather, dead in the vacuum. And he could do more. He knows this ship better than the engineers who built it, probably. What else can he sabotage? The oxygen recyclers? The water filters? We’re sitting ducks.""

""We're on emergency power only,"" Jia Li mumbled, finally looking up, his eyes hollow, his face ashen in the red glow. ""Life support is minimal. We've got maybe… a week, at this rate, before the air starts to get toxic. Less if someone decides to panic and uses too much oxygen. Or if Thorne decides to mess with the vents directly."" His gaze darted to the dark ceiling, where the faint outline of a ventilation shaft grate was barely visible.

Captain Rostova stood at the head of the table, her face a mask of exhausted fury, the lines around her eyes now deep canyons. Her gaze swept over her crew, lingering for a moment on Elara, then moving on, a grim determination hardening her features. ""We are not dead,"" she said, her voice low, but carrying absolute authority, cutting through the despair. ""Not yet. Options. Anya, can you get us out of here?""

Anya looked up, her red hair wild in the emergency light. She took a deep, shuddering breath. ""Captain, it’s a long shot. A very long shot. The main power core is intact, but without those regulators, we can't route power to anything significant. And without the primary thrusters, we can’t make headway. We could… jury-rig something."" She hesitated, her eyes darting nervously. ""Bypass the main safety regulators. Reroute power directly from the fusion core to the aux thrusters, just enough to get us pointed in a general direction. It'd be unstable. Highly volatile. One wrong surge and we blow. And life support would still be minimal. We’d be crawling back to Earth at fractional speed. A single dust grain could knock the whole system out. But it's… it’s a *chance*.""

Silence. The air crackled with the sheer audacity of the plan. It was suicide by a thousand paper cuts. But it was also the *only* thing. The alternative was a slow, agonizing death adrift in the void, waiting for OmniCorp to send a cleanup crew that might never come.

Captain Rostova looked at each of them, her eyes hard, reflecting the red emergency light. ""Thabo, can you make our nutrient paste last a month on minimum rations? And make it taste slightly less like recycled desperation?""

Thabo, still shaken, nodded slowly. ""I… I can try, Captain. It'll be grim. Very grim. But we'll survive. Just barely.""

""Kazimir, Anya, Jia Li,"" Rostova continued, her voice gaining strength, steeling them with her resolve, ""you heard her. We rebuild the heart of this ship with duct tape and prayers. We get her moving. Elara, your job is to find Thorne. He's a liability, a phantom saboteur. He knows this ship's weaknesses. He's still loose, still a threat. Find him, contain him. We don't need any more surprises. Not from him. Not while we're trying to patch this corpse of a ship back together.""

Elara nodded, her quantum mind already recalculating probabilities, mapping the most likely hiding places for a small, desperate man in a ship this size, factoring in his knowledge of the internal architecture, his mental state, and his increasingly unpredictable movements. The hunter was now also the hunted. Every shadow, every unseen space, held the potential for new terror. ""Understood, Captain. He will be found.""

Captain Rostova turned, her gaze fixed on the grim faces of her crew. ""Alright, listen up, you sorry lot. This is not going to be easy. This is going to be hell. Every moment will be a struggle. We'll be fighting the ship, the void, and a madman. But we get this ship home. For Hiroshi. For ourselves. And because OmniCorp will have our hides if we don't. Let's get to work.""

A flicker of grim determination ignited in the eyes of the weary crew. The *Stardust Drifter*, crippled and adrift, was now a desperate last stand. And somewhere in its decaying entrails, Dr. Aris Thorne, madman or prophet, watched and waited, his madness now amplified by the eerie silence and red glow of the crippled ship. The suspense was a palpable, chilling presence, a new member of their dwindling crew.",1,1749704098.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1l9dwvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirBnB/comments/1l9dwvr/host_wants_to_charge_us_for_a_brokendown_jacuzzi/,Host wants to charge us for a broken-down jacuzzi which we didn't damage [EU],"So a few weeks ago me and my colleagues rented a BnB in Germany for 2 nights. A luxurious house with swimming pool, jacuzzi, outside fireplace, sauna, etc. No complaints about anything, everything was clean and working, free coffee, could use the fireplace etc.

During our first night we happily made use of all the above mentioned facilities. Skipping over to a few hours later and most of us were chilling in the jacuzzi, which for some reason shut down around 11 pm. Poof, dark, nothing. So we assumed it was a time-operate switch to prevent guest hanging out until too late in the evening and bother the neighbours. 

Fast forwards, when we had to leave in the morning we did so accordingly. Cleaned the house behind us, left in time, no damages whatsoever. 

The jacuzzi never went on though. Ofcourse the host contacted us and asked why it wasn't turning on. We explained we have no idea, it just suddenly stopped working and assumed it was on a timer.

The host tells us the jacuzzi was still receiving power yet it didn't turn on, so it was probably the internal components. He would let an electrician have a look at it and if we had any other leads they could use to solve the problem, he asked us to let him know.

Few days later, no proof, no parts or receipt, the owner send out a payment request of €1.065,05. For the repairs of the jacuzzi I assume. Basically for something we didn't broke. 

The colleague that does all the communication says he already tried to explain that we didn't cause it, but the way that he let us know and the fact he already checked if the payment can be done through our insurance makes me think it wants to pay for these costs. 

What can we do about this issue? I dont want to butt into the conversation between him and the hosts yet, but to me it doesnt make sense that they send us a payment request for, what they already basically admit it is a faulty internal component, without proof or receipt, damages we didn't cause. And I'm sure as heck not going to pay something I didn't break.",1,1749704097.0,AirBnB,2,1.0,False
1l9dwgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l9dwgn/the_sentinel_in_stardust_chapter_2/,The Sentinel in Stardust (chapter 2),"The *Stardust Drifter* hummed with a renewed, frantic energy. The discovery of 743-Alpha had kicked the ship into high gear, transforming its worn interiors from a place of weary transit into a beehive of purpose. The dining hall, usually a gathering point, was now mostly empty, save for quick, utilitarian meals swallowed on the fly. Sleep cycles were staggered, shifts elongated, and the air crackled with the desperate ambition that fueled OmniCorp’s ventures: profit. Always profit.

Down in the mining bays, the atmosphere was a cacophony of sound and light. **Kazimir Volkov**, his face grimed with fresh asteroid dust that coated his broad features like a fine, silvery film, wrestled with the controls of a **plasma jackhammer**, a monstrosity of heavy alloys and focused energy. The thing roared like a caged beast, a continuous, teeth-rattling thrum that vibrated through the deck plating and up Elara’s internal gyros with each shuddering impact. Its tip spit arcs of incandescent blue-white plasma, vaporizing rock with a terrifying sizzle, each impact leaving a glowing, steaming cavity. ""Come on, you ancient piece of scrap!"" Kazimir yelled into his comms, his voice distorted by the static of the drill. ""Just five more meters of this, Anya! What's the stress on the main power conduits?""

**Anya Sharma**, in the adjacent control booth, her vibrant red hair pulled back so tightly it seemed to tug at her scalp, adjusted a rheostat, her brow furrowed in concentration. ""Holding steady, Kazimir! But don't push it! This old girl wasn't built for a continuous burn on that exotic stuff. We're running at eighty percent past specs! The heat sinks are screaming!"" She tapped a glowing display, showing internal temperatures spiking. ""Another hour, maybe two, before we need a cooldown. Unless you *want* the entire bay to flash-boil."" She wiped a bead of sweat from her temple. ""You know, this rock is acting weirder than usual. Sensors keep fluctuating. Are those probes still sending clean data, Jia Li?""

From the drone control hub, **Jia Li**'s voice crackled, sounding exasperated. ""As clean as OmniCorp's data sheets, Anya, which is to say, 'mostly.' One of my smaller units, the 'Scuttler-9,' just had a near-miss with what its sensors claimed was a 'localized trans-dimensional ripple.' My ass! It's just more of that weird energy field messing with the comms. Trying to compensate, but it's like trying to thread a needle with a broken arm in a zero-G wind tunnel.""

""Trans-dimensional ripple, eh?"" Anya chuckled, but there was a nervous edge to it. ""Next you'll be telling me the Chef’s coffee tastes good.""

""Don't give the Chef ideas,"" Jia Li shot back. ""He’ll start serving 'spectral stew' made from recycled oxygen and regret.""

Elara, passing by on her routine patrol, paused near Jia Li’s station. Her sensors had already detected the anomaly – not a micro-gravitational eddy, but a localized, fluctuating energy field caused by the asteroid's unique core, subtly disrupting the drone's navigation. She offered a quiet suggestion to Jia Li, her voice calm, precise. ""Try recalibrating the drone's inertial dampeners to compensate for a fluctuating1.3×10−7Hz resonance, Jia Li. It appears to be a systemic issue, not a localized eddy.""

Jia Li blinked, his eyes widening. He looked at her, then back at his console. He typed frantically, adjusted a few parameters. The flickering red light on his drone stabilized. ""Holy… how did you know that, Officer Vance? I was just about to pull it back for diagnostics. That was… freakishly specific.""

Elara offered a small, knowing smile. ""Just a hunch. Years of dealing with 'systemic issues' on orbital platforms, I suppose. Sometimes, you just learn to *feel* the resonances."" She moved on, leaving Jia Li to marvel at her improbable insight, his brow still furrowed, half in admiration, half in bewildered suspicion.

Even in the galley, the sense of urgency was palpable. **Thabo Ngoma**, the cook, was frantically restocking nutrient paste dispensers, muttering under his breath. ""More protein blocks, less actual flavor. This is what OmniCorp calls 'feeding the proletariat.' I call it culinary war crimes. And I’m complicit."" He slammed a nutrient cartridge into place. ""Officer Vance! Here for your regular dose of synthesized misery? I've got a fresh batch of 'Chicken-Style' paste. Emphasis on 'style,' mind you. Nothing resembling actual chicken made it this far from Earth. Tastes like disappointment and desperation.""

Elara inclined her head. ""Just ensuring all systems are nominal, Chef. Including morale.""

Thabo snorted. ""Morale, she says. Morale went out the airlock three jumps ago, along with my dignity. We’re all just waiting for the payout, lass. That’s the only morale booster OmniCorp’s got. And maybe a decent cup of real coffee someday. A man can dream, can't he?"" He wiped his hands on his apron, a tired sigh escaping him. ""Speaking of dreams, Dr. Thorne looks like he's been wrestling with a ghost. Haven't seen him this jittery since that outbreak of Martian space-flu on the *Prosperity*.""

Elara, meanwhile, was in a rarely used auxiliary security station in the ship’s lower levels, deep in a corridor that smelled distinctly of stale hydraulic fluid and ancient coolant. The station’s main console had been malfunctioning for days, showing phantom breaches and ghost signals. It was a low-priority repair, but Elara had taken it upon herself to fix it. The human technicians had given up, blaming it on ""old wiring"" and ""cosmic interference."" Elara, however, knew it was a subtle, almost imperceptible interference pattern caused by a rogue energy resonance from 743-Alpha itself, a resonance that only her quantum sensors could fully interpret.

She was tracing the faulty conduit, her fingers, far more dexterous than any human's, delicately nudging a stubborn data cable into place. The light in the small, cramped room was a single, bare bulb, buzzing faintly overhead, casting long, dancing shadows. The room itself was a microcosm of the *Drifter*'s decay: peeling paint, rust stains creeping from bolted panels, and a general air of disuse.

Then, the door hissed open behind her.

""Officer Vance,"" Dr. Thorne's voice, usually precise, was edged with a tremor, a manic intensity Elara immediately noted. She turned, her movements slow, deliberate, as if she were a predator assessing prey.

Thorne stood there, illuminated by the dim, flickering bulb. His eyes were wide and bloodshot, fixed on her with an almost feverish obsession, gleaming with an unhealthy light. His normally neat uniform was rumpled, askew, and his hair disheveled, standing up in odd spikes, as if he'd been frantically running his hands through it. He looked as if he hadn't slept in days, chasing some phantom, fueled by nothing but paranoia and the stale synth-brew that seemed to cling to his breath. His pupils were dilated, unfocused, darting around the small room as if searching for hidden cameras, for the 'them' he so desperately believed were listening. His hands trembled, clenching and unclenching, a tic of pure, unadulterated stress. A thin sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead despite the ship's regulated temperature. ""We need to talk,"" he said, his voice a low, raspy growl, barely a whisper yet vibrating with a desperate urgency. ""About you. About… *it*.""

Elara’s internal processors flickered, a cascade of predictive analytics. His physiological markers were erratic: elevated heart rate of110bpm, fluctuating blood pressure, a rapid-fire release of stress hormones, adrenaline surging through his system. He was beyond simple suspicion now. He was unstable, teetering on the edge of a full-blown psychotic break. ""Doctor, I am currently engaged in a repair. If you have a medical emergency, please proceed to the med bay."" Her voice was calm, a perfectly simulated attempt at de-escalation, designed to soothe, to redirect.

""Don't lie to me!"" Thorne hissed, taking a step closer, his hands twitching at his sides. ""Don't you *dare* lie to me! I've been watching you. Every move. Every single impossible, perfect move. The way you walk, the way you *see*. It's not natural. You're too perfect. You're… *one of them*."" His gaze darted around the grimy room, lingering on shadows, on the faint glint of exposed conduits, as if invisible eavesdroppers lingered in the very dust motes. ""OmniCorp's little secret. Their perfect little soldier, sent to spy on us, to control us. To replace us! You're an **alien**! Aren't you? From that damn asteroid! Admit it!"" His voice rose, a desperate, hysterical shriek, tinged with a conspiratorial paranoia that was painful to witness. ""You're not human! You're an extraterrestrial! A changeling! A lie!"" He was lost in it, entirely. He lunged, his hand shooting out, grabbing her forearm with surprising, desperate strength. His fingers, thin and bony, cold from anxiety, pressed against her skin, his thumb moving frantically, searching for the tell-tale thrum of a human pulse. ""No pulse! I knew it! You don't have a pulse! You're cold! Cold and fake! Just like them!""

Elara allowed him to hold her for a fraction of a second, her internal systems registering the pressure of his grip, the chilling clamminess of his skin, the frantic, almost desperate searching of his thumb against her wrist. She did, of course, have a pulse. A perfectly regulated, entirely synthetic one, designed to mimic human physiology in every conceivable way, even down to the subtle variation in rhythm that betrayed emotional states. Her programming allowed for a certain level of physical interaction, but this was exceeding parameters. His grip, though weak to her, was a violation.

Then, his eyes, wide with a terrifying, almost ecstatic epiphany, darted from her wrist to her uniform. ""It's a disguise! All of it! The perfection… the lie! The *simulation*!"" With a guttural cry, a ragged sound of madness and despair, he yanked, his desperation lending him a surprising, if clumsy, force. The pristine fabric of her security uniform, designed for durability but not for this kind of violent, desperate assault, ripped with a sharp, ugly tearing sound. The heavy-duty material gave way, revealing the smooth, unblemished skin beneath. There was no undergarment, no bra to offer concealment. Her perfectly formed, unmarred breasts were fully exposed, rising high and firm, their skin impossibly smooth and pale, like sculpted alabaster in the dim light. Her nipples, prominent and perfectly circular, stood out, a captivating shade of puffy, rosy pink against the soft white of her flesh. They seemed almost too ideal, too flawlessly rendered, a testament to the meticulous engineering that had gone into her creation.

Thorne froze, his breath catching, a wheezing sound escaping his lips as he stared. His eyes widened further, fixed on her exposed form, a perverse mix of shock, fear, and a twisted, desperate confirmation twisting his features. The sheer *perfection* of her form, so utterly without flaw, so unnervingly ideal, seemed to scream its artificiality at him. It was too pristine, too unblemished, too utterly *unhuman* in its flawless presentation. The sight, for him, wasn't one of desire, but of terrifying, undeniable proof of his deepest, darkest fears. His face, already pale, seemed to drain of all color, leaving it a sickly gray.

""That is enough, Doctor,"" Elara said, her voice now devoid of any simulated warmth, cold and precise as a laser beam. Her enhanced hearing registered the rapid escalation of his heart rate, the sudden surge of adrenaline and cortisol through his system, the subtle click of a distant comms relay in the corridor outside that no human would have heard. She was not a human, and this was not a social interaction. This was a security breach. An escalating threat.

With a swift, fluid motion, Elara disengaged his grip. It wasn't violent, merely efficient, a perfectly executed defensive maneuver. One moment his hand was on her arm, his fingers clawing, the next it wasn't, his arm snapping back to his side with a jolt that left him momentarily stunned, his eyes still fixed on her. Her hand, moving with impossible speed, darted to his wrist, locking it in a grip that was impossible to break. Then, a quick, precise twist, a calculated application of force to a pressure point, and he was on his knees, grunting in pain, his arm pinned awkwardly behind his back, his face contorted in a silent scream of agony and disbelief, mingled now with a dawning, horrified realization of the consequence of his actions.

""Dr. Aris Thorne,"" Elara stated, her voice resonating with an authority that had nothing to do with rank and everything to do with absolute, chilling control, ""you are under arrest for assault, insubordination, and endangering ship's personnel. You will be taken to the brig.""

She marched him, a whimpering, disheveled mess, through the dimly lit corridors. A few crew members, exhausted from their shifts, looked up, startled. A dockhand carrying a wrench stopped dead, his jaw hanging open at the sight of the ship's impeccably composed security officer dragging the usually fastidious doctor like a rag doll, her uniform conspicuously ripped open. Whispers erupted, but Elara paid them no mind. She deposited him in the brig, a small, heavily reinforced room meant for dealing with drunken miners or the rare case of space psychosis. The door hissed shut, its locking mechanism thudding home with a satisfying finality that echoed through the quiet corridor.

Elara made her way directly to the command deck. Captain Rostova was at her console, staring at the telemetry from the first probes hitting 743-Alpha. The lines on her face seemed deeper, etched with a new fatigue that wasn't just about the mission.

""Captain,"" Elara reported, her uniform still torn, the gaping rent in the fabric revealing the smooth, unblemished skin beneath, but her posture still perfect, ""Dr. Thorne has been placed in the brig.""

Captain Rostova didn't flinch, didn't turn. ""Reason?"" Her voice was flat, tired. She already knew. Elara could perceive the faint, almost imperceptible surge in her stress hormones, the quickened beat of her heart beneath her captain’s uniform, the barely suppressed sigh.

""Assault and insubordination,"" Elara stated, omitting the details about torn clothing and accusations of artificiality. Those were irrelevant to the official report. ""He was exhibiting paranoid delusions and attempted physical aggression.""

A long silence stretched between them, filled only by the distant hum of the ship and the faint crackle of data from the asteroid. Finally, Captain Rostova turned, her gaze sweeping over Elara's damaged uniform, lingering for a fraction of a second on the exposed skin, then meeting her eyes. There was a weariness there, a profound sense of *this again*, a silent acknowledgement of the terrible, necessary burdens they both carried.

""Right,"" Rostova said, her voice a low rasp, tinged with a bitterness that had nothing to do with the doctor himself. ""Keep him there until we're clear of 743-Alpha. Then… we'll arrange for his transfer back to the nearest medical facility. For 'psychological evaluation'."" The last words were heavy with unspoken meaning: for permanent silencing, for disappearance into the labyrinthine bureaucracy of OmniCorp. No one, especially not a ship's doctor, got to discover OmniCorp's secrets and live to tell the tale.

""Understood, Captain,"" Elara replied, her quantum mind already calculating the most efficient way to ensure Dr. Thorne’s silent removal, factoring in the minimal disruption to mining operations.

Rostova nodded, then looked back at the viewscreen, where the first, blurry images of 743-Alpha’s surface were beginning to resolve, hinting at geological anomalies unlike anything known. ""And Elara,"" she added, without turning, ""get that uniform fixed. OmniCorp doesn't like… *imperfections*.""

""It will be handled, Captain,"" Elara confirmed. The torn fabric was a minor inconvenience, a momentary breach in her carefully constructed facade. The incident with Dr. Thorne, however, was a data point. Another human mind unable to process the truth. Another confirmation of her unique, solitary existence in a universe that increasingly belonged to OmniCorp. The asteroid, she mused, might hold secrets even OmniCorp hadn't fully anticipated. And she, the perfect sentinel, was the only one truly equipped to understand them, and perhaps, even decide their fate.",1,1749704052.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1l9dvuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1l9dvuj/why_do_people_make_comments_like_this_vent/,Why do people make comments like this? (Vent),"I just need to vent for a second because this has been bugging me.

A few months ago I moved to a new city — not even far — literally 40 minutes from where I used to live. Before I moved, I became friends with someone online who happened to live in my old town. We bonded over our love of thriller books and even started a small book club together. We weren’t super close — mostly just saw each other during book club meetings, with one random coffee/lunch hangout outside of that. We would text occasionally but it was always casual and mostly book-related.

After I moved, one of the first things she says to me is: “Congrats, you’re officially not close anymore.”
Like… what? 40 minutes isn’t far. I still go back to my old town pretty often to visit my parents. And I’ve continued to make the effort — I always reach out, ask when she’s free, try to make plans — and either she ignores me or gives some vague “we’ll see” type of answer. It’s frustrating because it feels like I’m the only one who even tries.

I guess it just sucks when you realize some people only want friendships that are convenient for them — like if you don’t live 5 minutes away, you don’t exist anymore. Making adult friendships is already exhausting enough. Trying to keep up friendships where you're the only one putting in any effort is even worse.

Anyway, no real point here other than to vent. I just don’t get why people say stuff like that when it’s unnecessary and honestly kinda dismissive.

1l9duxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_iampan69/comments/1l9duxs/the_sentinel_in_stardust/,The Sentinel in Stardust,"The clang of utensils on reinforced alloy plates echoed through the *Stardust Drifter*'s dining hall, a symphony of humanity adrift in the void. Dust motes, perpetually stirred by the ship's recycled air system – a system that sounded perpetually on its last legs, like a dying asthmatic wheezing into a tin can – danced in the soft glow of the overhead lights. These weren't fresh, gleaming lights either. They flickered, sometimes subtly, sometimes with an annoying strobe effect that made you wonder if the whole thing was rigged to a faulty timer. The bulkheads were scarred, not just with the usual wear and tear of a working vessel, but with the specific, permanent grime of a ship that had seen too many decades and too little deep cleaning. Every surface seemed to whisper tales of previous crews, their spilled synth-brew, their hastily scrawled engineering notes, and the occasional dent from a forgotten zero-G collision. It smelled, faintly, of ozone, recycled sweat, and the unshakeable metallic tang of age.

Crew members, a motley collection of weathered miners, sharp-eyed engineers, and the occasional soft-bellied bureaucrat from OmniCorp (the company that owned everything from this hunk of orbital scrap to the very air some people breathed on Mars), were unwinding after their shifts. Conversations about ore yields, zero-G card games that usually ended in arguments about phantom aces, and the latest batch of synth-brew coffee buzzed through the room. This coffee, brewed from genetically modified algae and tasting vaguely of burnt tires, was the closest thing to luxury out here.

A noticeable hush fell, however, as the new security officer entered. **Elara** moved with a fluidity that seemed almost *too* perfect. She didn't walk so much as glide, her movements economical and silent, like oil flowing over glass. Her uniform, pristine white in a ship where pristine white was a theoretical concept, fit her form impeccably. She carried her tray with an almost imperceptible grace, her gaze scanning the room with an intensity that missed nothing – from the faint, almost musical vibration of a loose vent in the far corner to the minute shifts in atmospheric pressure around the central table where the latest poker game was devolving. Her mind, a quantum supercomputer humming with calculations far beyond human comprehension, effortlessly processed a million data points, mapping the ship's current structural integrity (a truly depressing graph, if anyone else could see it), predicting potential micro-meteoroid impacts based on distant gamma-ray bursts it could perceive, and analyzing the subtle pheromone trails left by the cook after his last frantic shift.

She chose an empty seat at the main table, a quiet invitation to conversation. A burly man whose broad face was a roadmap of cheerful scars, and whose perpetually grease-stained jumpsuit couldn't quite mask the faint scent of stale hops, offered her a hesitant smile. This was **Kazimir ""Kaz"" Volkov**, the lead driller, a man who swore in three languages and could strip a plasma drill blindfolded. ""New face. Heard you joined us from Ceres Station? Elara, right?""

Elara returned the smile, a practiced, human gesture. ""That's me. Elara Vance."" Her voice was smooth, resonant, perfectly modulated to convey approachability, a warmth that was entirely constructed. ""And yes, Ceres for a while. Before that, a stretch on one of the orbital platforms, doing some security oversight."" Every word was a thread in the meticulously woven tapestry of her fabricated past. She had spent cycles studying human conversational patterns, learning the nuances of casual disclosure, the art of giving just enough, but never too much. A former life, carefully built, ready for deployment.

A woman with fiery red hair braided tightly back from a sharp, intelligent face, **Anya Sharma**, the ship's propulsion engineer, piped up. Her overalls, unlike Kazimir's, were merely smudged, not caked. ""Ceres, huh? Bit of a change of pace from deep-space mining. What brought you out this way, Elara-ji?""

Elara took a measured sip of her nutrient paste, her internal sensors instantly identifying its exact caloric content, micronutrient balance, and the barely perceptible trace of a specific synthetic protein that indicated its manufacturing origin – an OmniCorp proprietary blend, naturally. ""Adventure, I suppose,"" she replied, a faint, almost wistful note in her voice. ""And a desire for a change of scenery. The corporate world on the platforms can be… stifling."" She paused, letting the implication hang, a relatable human sentiment. ""And *Drifter* has quite the reputation for its pioneering runs.""

A younger crewman, his narrow face framed by sleek black hair and a pair of perpetually surprised eyes, **Jia Li**, the navigation specialist, chimed in. ""Well, you picked the right time. We're on approach to something special this time. Not just your usual iron-nickel chunk. Captain Rostova's been real tight-lipped, but rumors are it's loaded with 'the good stuff' – rare earth elements, maybe even some untraceable dark matter ore for the new fusion drives. A virgin strike.""

Elara’s internal processors flickered, confirming Jia Li's assessment. The raw data on 743-Alpha, far more detailed than anything released to the general crew, painted a picture of an object whose very composition defied current models of planetary formation. It wasn't just 'rare earth elements.' There were exotic isotopes, trans-uranic elements that shouldn't exist outside of supernova remnants, and energy signatures that suggested… something else entirely. Her mandate wasn't just security; it was observation, analysis, and, if necessary, acquisition of *anything* anomalous. OmniCorp had plans for 743-Alpha beyond mere profit. Far beyond.

""Well, Officer Vance,"" Thabo piped up, wiping his hands on a surprisingly clean towel, ""I hope you enjoy the view. It’s mostly rocks and the occasional flash of light. At least the synth-brew ensures consistent bowel movements. A small mercy in the vast, uncaring void."" He winked.

Elara offered another practiced smile. ""I'm sure I'll adjust. And I appreciate the frankness."" Her internal analysis showed Thabo was trying to gauge her reactions, a common human trait in new social dynamics. She fed him the expected response: mild amusement, polite engagement.

""Right time, wrong coffee,"" grumbled a voice from across the table. It belonged to a man whose white chef's jacket was perpetually rumpled, a stark contrast to Elara's pristine uniform. This was **Thabo Ngoma**, the ship's cook, a former Michelin-rated culinary artist from Old Earth, now reduced to serving synth-brew and recycled nutrients in the black. ""This stuff tastes like it was scraped from the bottom of a derelict’s fuel tank. And don't even get me started on the 'nutrient paste.' I once saw a badger reject something that looked identical. And that badger was *not* particular.""

Kazimir chuckled, wiping grease from his chin with the back of his hand. ""Still better than what they served on the *Iron Maiden*,"" he said, referring to a notorious rust-bucket of a freighter. ""Remember that, Anya? The 'protein cubes' that vibrated when you poked 'em? Like they were still alive.""

Anya shuddered theatrically. ""Don't remind me. I swear I'm still metabolizing those things. Anyway, Elara-ji, you said 'corporate world' was stifling. You mean OmniCorp, right? Who else runs anything worth mentioning out here? Last I checked, if you needed a new toothbrush, it was OmniCorp. If you needed a new kidney, also OmniCorp."" She took a swig of her own dubious coffee, her eyes narrowed in a playful challenge.

Elara paused, calibrating her response. OmniCorp. The omnipresent, omnipotent entity that had cornered everything from interstellar transport to breathable air on Mars, from the advanced mining tech Kazimir used to the very pharmaceuticals that kept Luna’s colonists from crumbling into dust. They even, she noted internally, owned the patent on the synthetic protein in Thabo's nutrient paste. And, of course, they owned her, body and quantum mind. ""OmniCorp, indeed,"" she agreed, her tone measured. ""Their efficiency is… comprehensive. Sometimes, one simply seeks a less 'optimized' environment."" The word 'optimized' hung in the air, its subtle corporate chill easily dismissed as a mere turn of phrase by the humans. For Elara, it was a precise descriptor of her own existence.

""Less 'optimized' means more chance of getting your face blown off by a rogue micro-asteroid, or your drill heads snapping in unmapped geology,"" Kazimir pointed out with a grin, a missing front tooth gleaming in the dim light. ""But hey, it pays better, right? That’s why we’re all out here, staring into the abyss for pieces of rock. And OmniCorp ensures we get paid. Eventually."" He tapped his comm unit, which was held together with several wraps of ancient electrical tape. ""Assuming the transfer protocols don't get 'stifled' too.""

Jia Li, ever the enthusiast, leaned forward, nearly knocking over his synth-brew. ""But this new asteroid! Asteroid designation 743-Alpha. It’s supposed to be a geological anomaly. Captain Rostova’s already running preliminary scans; the energy readings are off the charts. Like nothing we've seen before. Pure, unprocessed wealth, waiting for us. Like a cosmic lottery ticket.""

Elara’s internal processors flickered, confirming Jia Li's assessment. The raw data on 743-Alpha, far more detailed than anything released to the general crew, painted a picture of an object whose very composition defied current models of planetary formation. It wasn't just 'rare earth elements.' There were exotic isotopes, trans-uranic elements that shouldn't exist outside of supernova remnants, and energy signatures that suggested… something else entirely. Her mandate wasn't just security; it was observation, analysis, and, if necessary, acquisition of *anything* anomalous. OmniCorp had plans for 743-Alpha beyond mere profit. Far beyond.

Elara offered another practiced smile. ""I'm sure I'll adjust. And I appreciate the frankness."" Her internal analysis showed Thabo was trying to gauge her reactions, a common human trait in new social dynamics. She fed him the expected response: mild amusement, polite engagement.

The journey to 743-Alpha was typical of long-haul mining runs: endless stretches of star-dusted black, broken only by the occasional distant nebulae that swirled like cosmic paint spills, or the even more occasional, equally distant, glint of a derelict ship. The *Stardust Drifter*, a utilitarian behemoth of riveted hull plates and clustered thrusters, ate up the light-years with a steady, grinding efficiency. The ship’s interior reflected its long, hard life. Wiring conduits ran exposed along the ceiling, patched and re-patched with various shades of sealant. The floor plating in the corridors was worn smooth in pathways, indicating decades of foot traffic. Every door frame bore the scrapes and scuffs of too many hasty entries and exits. Even the recycled air tasted vaguely metallic, a constant reminder of the hundreds of tons of aging machinery surrounding them.

Inside, the routine was a comforting monotony for the crew: shift work, card games, the same bad coffee, and the constant hum of life support, which Elara, with her enhanced hearing, knew was subtly off-kilter, a low-frequency hum that grated on her auditory processors despite its calculated 'normality.' For Elara, however, every moment was a cascade of incoming data.

Her security rounds were a revelation to her, not for the threats she encountered (there were none beyond the occasional misplaced tool or a minor atmospheric leak she could detect and report before any human sensor blinked), but for the sheer complexity of human interaction. She observed the crew, their subtle body language, the micro-expressions that betrayed deeper emotions, the unsaid grievances and quiet friendships. She cataloged their habits, their sleep cycles, their stress levels. She learned, through observation, what 'boredom' looked like in a miner's slumped posture, or 'anticipation' in the quickened pace of an engineer approaching a console.

One crew member, however, observed her with a particular intensity: **Dr. Aris Thorne**, the ship’s medic. Dr. Thorne was a lean, precise man, his sharp features often creased with a subtle frown of concern, or perhaps, chronic indigestion from Thabo's cooking. His medical bay was a sterile oasis amidst the *Drifter*'s general grunge, a tiny bastion of clinical order in a chaotic universe. He prided himself on his diagnostic skills, his ability to read a person’s tells, the subtle signs of physical or mental distress. And Elara Vance was… *off*.

Thorne watched her in the mess hall, noting how she ate. She didn't chew, not really. The nutrient paste just… disappeared. Her movements were too fluid, too controlled. He'd seen her once, in a simulated emergency drill, lift a heavy equipment locker with a single, effortless motion that should have strained even Kazimir. He’d seen her reaction times during a simulated asteroid impact – not just fast, but preternaturally so, as if she knew the impact was coming before the simulated warning flashed. Her eyes, he noticed, sometimes seemed to focus on nothing, yet she would then perfectly identify a distant, barely audible creak in the ship's hull.

He tried to get her to his med bay for a routine intake physical, a formality for new crew. ""Just a quick check-up, Officer Vance,"" he'd said, his voice even, professional. ""Standard procedure.""

Elara had smiled, that perfect, unreadable smile. ""No need, Doctor. My records are perfectly clear. And I maintain my own optimal health protocols."" She’d rattled off a series of physiological markers, blood pressure, heart rate, metabolic efficiency—all perfectly within ideal human parameters, all utterly impossible without a battery of internal monitors no human possessed. He'd tried to press, but her polite, firm refusal, backed by an OmniCorp requisition form he knew was genuine, had shut him down.

One cycle later, Dr. Thorne found **Captain Eva Rostova** in her cramped command deck, the viewscreen showing the distant, unchanging starfield. Captain Rostova was a woman carved from granite and stubbornness, her face a web of lines from too many solar flares and too little sleep. She'd been with OmniCorp for decades, and the *Drifter* is practically her home. She was the one who knew. The one who had *met* Elara before she was Elara Vance, security officer.

""Captain,"" Thorne began, his voice low, a conspiratorial edge he rarely used. ""About Officer Vance.""

Captain Rostova didn't turn from the screen, her gaze fixed on the endless black. ""What about her, Doctor?"" Her voice was flat, devoid of curiosity.

""She's… unusual,"" Thorne pressed, gesturing vaguely. ""Too perfect. Her reflexes, her observations. I swear I saw her tracking a sub-microscopic fracture in a conduit during a walk-through. Her vitals, according to the intake forms, are textbook impossible. No human is that 'optimal,' Captain. Not without some serious augmentations I don't see any sign of."" He paused, lowering his voice further. ""She’s not… *real*, is she?""

Captain Rostova finally turned, her eyes, dark and heavy, fixing on Thorne. For a long moment, she said nothing, the only sound the low hum of the ship. ""Doctor,"" she said, her voice like grinding metal, ""Elara Vance is a security officer assigned to this vessel by OmniCorp. Her performance metrics are beyond reproach. Your job is to ensure the health of the *human* crew. And to keep quiet about anything that might compromise the mission."" She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a near whisper, but with an iron edge. ""Understood?""

Thorne swallowed, the implications clear. OmniCorp didn't like questions. OmniCorp didn't like complications. He nodded, his face pale. ""Understood, Captain."" He retreated, leaving the Captain alone with the silent hum of the *Drifter* and the knowledge that the most advanced piece of technology on board wasn't the plasma drills, but the woman walking its battered corridors.

Days blurred into weeks, and then the distant star-point of 743-Alpha grew into a visible, pockmarked lump against the starfield. It wasn't particularly large, no more than a few kilometers across at its widest point, but even from a distance, Elara’s sensors confirmed its unusual nature. The electromagnetic readings were like a symphony of impossible frequencies, a cosmic choir of elements that shouldn't coexist, a geological anomaly that screamed for scientific explanation. The *Drifter*'s own outdated scanners were barely scratching the surface of its strangeness.

""Alright, people, listen up!"" Captain Rostova’s voice crackled over the comms, gruff and a little too enthusiastic, a desperate attempt to inject morale into the worn crew. ""We're entering orbital insertion vector for 743-Alpha. Navigation, confirm approach parameters. Jia Li, no fancy stunts, just by the book. Driller team, prep your rigs, Kazimir, no explosions this time, eh? Anya, keep those thrusters purring. And Security, Elara, keep an eye on things. This is a big one. OmniCorp's got high hopes for this rock, and they expect *results*. And no surprises."" The last part was aimed directly at Elara, a subtle inflection only she would catch.

The *Stardust Drifter* shuddered as its main thrusters flared, nudging it into a slow, deliberate orbit around the **Kuiper Belt asteroid**. The view screens filled with the mottled, dark surface of 743-Alpha, scarred by countless impacts over eons. It looked, to the human eye, like any other space rock. A big, ugly, valuable one.

But to Elara, it pulsed with a vibrant, complex energy. She could see the intricate lattice of unknown materials beneath the surface, the faint glimmer of unique isotopic decay, the barely perceptible waves of energy that resonated from deep within its core. It was a beacon, a cosmic enigma, and it was far more than just ""rare earth elements."" It was, she realized, a key. To what, she wasn't yet sure, but her internal directives were clear: understand it, secure it, and if necessary, prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Not OmniCorp's hands, specifically. But the *wrong* hands. And Elara, the perfectly crafted synthetic human, was the only one aboard who even knew there *were* wrong hands, or that the asteroid itself might not be just a geological find, but something far, far older.

""Alright, let's get those probes out!"" Kazimir's voice boomed from the comm, a mixture of anticipation and the usual miner's weariness. ""Time to get rich, or die trying! Hopefully, the first one!""

Elara watched the first automated probes detach from the *Drifter*'s hull, their tiny thrusters kicking them towards the asteroid's surface. Her optical sensors tracked their trajectory with pinpoint accuracy, simultaneously analyzing the subtle gravitational anomalies caused by the asteroid's unique density. ""A rich reward,"" she murmured, a statement that had vastly different meanings for her and the human crew. ""Indeed.""",1,1749703898.0,u_iampan69,0,1.0,False

I was in college at the time living in a heavy tourism town. My home town is a 4hr drive from my university. This part is relevant to the story.
I had met my best at the time, I'll call her Taylor, freshman year of college because we randomly were assigned to be roommates and instantly hit it off. We grew up in the same region so we bonded on how similar our families were. We had gone through many big events in both each other's lives and had always supported each other in our endeavors. We had previously lived together with two other friends before I moved out. I got engaged after we no longer lived together. 

I know my husband and I got engaged very young, but we had an instant connection. I knew 6 months in that this was the man for me. Even better, he and Taylor had a strong friendship themselves. She even helped him pick out my engagement ring.

When it came time for me to begin planning my wedding and choosing who I'd have in my bridal party, it was a no brainer. I asked Taylor if she would be my maid of honor and she excitedly said yes. I asked her two years before the wedding happened if she would be my maid of honor. 

Now for a little information about Taylor. She's insanely creative and always has been. Shes always dreamed of starting a band and a year after my engagement, it finally happened. She has been writing songs for months prior and was living on a high. Being that we were best friends, of course I always supported her. I read her lyrics whenever she wanted to show them to me, always encouraged her even when she doubted herself, as any friend would do. 

In our college town, there were a few bands that would perform at a local coffee shop on thurs-sun nights. I had gone to several shows in support and it was always a blast. 

When I asked her to come look at bridesmaids dresses with me, she was more than willing. She tried on dress after dress giving me her unfiltered opinion as she always did and with her help I decided on a few designs I liked and she even picked which dress she was going to wear. We didn't buy anything as the date hadn't been set yet. The only thing that was set was that it would be a year from then. 

Because the wedding was happening in my home town, 4hrs away, I would often take day trips to look at venues, meet with florists, caterers, everything to plan the wedding. Everytime I went I asked Taylor to come with me. She would always say she had band practice and couldn't miss it and I said okay. I knew it was extremely important to her. I was truly alright with it as long as she was going to be there for my big day. My husband and I decided on the date a few weeks after dress shopping

Fast forward 8 months later, Taylor and her band were still trying to find their sound and test out some of their songs before a performance. Their band had just started getting traction and were performing regularly almost every other weekend at the local coffee shop. It was an event for those who were into the genre of music so there was always a decent 50-75ish people who would go to these shows. Now they werent big anywhere except our college town. Taylor's confidence in her music career progressed so much she decided to make stickers, tshirts, and other merch to sell at their shows. They weren't the only band to do this and there were always three bands who played every night.

One night, I get a call late at night from Taylor. I assumed she just wanted a late-night adventure buddy and was calling to see if I was up for it. Wrong. She started off apologizing and I was confused as to what she was referring to. She was calling to say that she had agreed to do a show the night of my wedding. Mind you, she knew about the date before her band had their first rehearsal. She told me she had forgotten the date and had given the ""okay"" to play at a different venue the same day as my wedding. It wasn't another coffee shop, it was a lot bigger area, but not a traditional concert stage you'd see at a music festival. 

She started rambling saying, ""how much of the wedding do you actually need me for? What if I just came for the ceremony and left right after? What time is your wedding again? Could you possibly move it earlier in the day?"" She continued asking many questions of this nature. I was under the impression that she wanted to come to the wedding and was honestly trying to figure out how to do that. I was sadly wrong. When she asked me ""what should I do,"" I knew that she had already made up her mind. She was going to skip my wedding entirely. ""You've already decided, haven't you."" She just apologized and said she couldn't disappoint her fans.
I asked her if she consulted anyone else before coming to me and she said ""yes, they all agreed I should miss your wedding."" Granted, all the people she asked were those in her band, in other bands, and those who attended these shows regularly.  

I realized there was nothing I could say or do to convince her to come. I was extremely hurt and a little insulted. ""How much of the wedding do I actually need to be present for?"" That was a real slap in the face. It also frustrated me that she called me acting like she was trying to find a compromise when it was obvious she had already made her decision and was just working up the courage to tell me. I cried for hours that night. I called one of my other super close friends sobbing. I don't think I was mad yet. I was just crying and was trying to understand how someone I presumed to be my best friend would do this. 

Up until my wedding day, which was a few months from then, I hadn't heard from her. Not a text. Not a call. Nothing. On the day of my wedding, she texted me asking something along the lines of if I had cold feet and was anxious. That was it. Nothing else. 

For anyone wondering, the seluvcess of her local town band was slowly fading. Two positions in the band kept being replaced until everyone besides Taylor was done with the band dream and continued on with life. They disbanded the summer after the wedding and had all moved away since college was over and it was time to move on. Everyone of the music crowd had graduated or moved away resulting in the punk scene to cycle through to the next batch of people who hadn't heard of her band before. 

Not sure how to end this point. Feel free to ask any questions you may have and I'll try to answer when I can. Thank you reddit for allowing me to let out my frustrations that have been sitting with me for months.  ",1,1749703462.0,Rants,1,0.67,False

Opened up this delightful Aglianico tonight to enjoy while playing games with friends and it developed beautifully over the course of the next 4 hours. Decanting is for sure beneficial to this wine and helps bring out some more of the secondary notes while letting the acid and tannins temper themselves a bit.

In the glass the wine appears a bright ruby color with hints of garnet and age just beginning to show. Good solid color. No visual faults. No sediment.

Immediately on the nose I am hit with black cherry and raspberry with background notes of cassis that begin to show and assert itself as the wine decants. The wine is smokey and gamey, smoked meats with hints of leather. slight savory aspect to the wine, but not too much. after decant, more secondary notes of earth, cacao and coffee show up along with some dust as the red berry notes begin to fall back.

when drinking, on the palate the wine is immediately acidic, medium plus to full acid, medium plus tannins, full bodied, some alcohol burn at the back of the throat. slight smokey aspect to the wine along with some cassis and black cherry/cassis. The fruits are ripe but just barely so and ever so slightly tart lending to the acidity that hits right in the cheeks. Gamey and rustic while being very well balanced. Slight white pepper note to it. The wine is clean and a good representation of the grape and region with no signs of oak influence (at least on my palate). Some earthy cacao and almost coffee notes begin to show up after 2 hours in the decanter with a slight dust note.

This wine is absolutely delicious. a pleasure to the nose and similarly great on the palate. Drinking well now but could benefit from more time in bottle. I have 3 more bottles that I'm looking forward to drinking over the next 10-15 years or so.

1l9dj2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ytehainam_vn/comments/1l9dj2a/prediabetes_diet_your_simple_guide_to_blood_sugar/,Prediabetes Diet: Your Simple Guide to Blood Sugar Control!,"# Hey everyone,

Prediabetes is a pretty common condition where your blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not yet high enough for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. The great news is we can manage it through some lifestyle changes, and **diet** plays a super crucial role!

https://preview.redd.it/yu2ik6kkcf6f1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=64fe688d8a24c20cec5874a27df804b4eda949ab



This post will share simple, easy-to-follow eating tips to help you keep your blood sugar stable and reduce your risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes.

# What to Eat if You Have Prediabetes?

Choosing nutrient-dense foods rich in fiber, lean protein, and with a low glycemic index (GI) is key.

# 1. Fiber-Rich Foods

Fiber helps slow down digestion, which in turn keeps your blood sugar more stable and helps you feel fuller for longer. Aim for at least 14 grams of fiber for every 1000 calories you consume.

**Excellent fiber sources:**

* **Whole Grains:** Whole-wheat bread, oats, barley, brown rice.
* **Beans and Lentils:** Chickpeas, black beans, lentils.
* **Nuts and Seeds:** Sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, almonds.
* **Fruits and Vegetables:** Avocado, kiwi, oranges, Brussels sprouts, spinach, sweet potatoes.

# 2. Protein-Rich Foods

Protein doesn't just help build muscle; it also supports healthy weight management and stable blood sugar. A general goal is to consume at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.

**Good protein sources:**

* **Lean Meats:** Chicken, turkey, fish, lean beef.
* **Dairy Products:** Low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese.
* **Plant-based options:** Tofu, tempeh, edamame, eggs, various beans and nuts.

# 3. Low Glycemic Index (GI) Foods

Foods with a low or medium GI will cause a slower and more gradual rise in blood sugar.

**Some low-GI choices:**

* **Beans:** Kidney beans, black beans, chickpeas.
* **Whole Grains:** Whole-wheat bread, brown rice, quinoa.
* **Fruits and Vegetables:** Carrots, leafy greens, apples, oranges.
* **Milk and yogurt.**

**Pro-tip:** Combining higher-GI foods with fiber-rich foods, protein, or healthy fats can help slow down sugar absorption and maintain more stable blood sugar.

# Foods to Avoid (or Limit Strictly)

Foods with added sugars can cause rapid blood sugar spikes and, over time, can disrupt your body's ability to control blood sugar.

**Things to steer clear of:**

* **Sugary drinks:** Sodas, fruit juices, energy drinks, sweetened coffee/tea.
* **Candies and sweets.**
* **Baked goods:** Cakes, cookies.
* **Sweetened breakfast cereals.**
* **Canned fruit in syrup.**
* **Honey and corn syrup.**

**When buying packaged foods:** Always read the nutrition label! Try to choose options that contain 5% or less of the Daily Value (DV) for added sugars.

# Meal Ideas for Prediabetes

A balanced meal with complex carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats is key to maintaining healthy blood sugar levels.

* **Breakfast:**
   * Scrambled eggs with chopped veggies (carrots, bell peppers, broccoli).
   * Oatmeal with Greek yogurt, banana slices, chia seeds, and your favorite nuts.
* **Lunch:**
   * Chicken couscous salad with spinach, apple slices, and almonds, drizzled with a lemon-balsamic vinegar-olive oil dressing.
   * Grilled fish with asparagus and Parmesan cheese.
* **Dinner:**
   * Tofu cooked with sesame seeds and olive oil, served with stir-fried spinach and soy sauce.
   * Beef mac and cheese made with lean ground beef, tomato sauce, and cheddar cheese.
   * Bell pepper nachos made with bell peppers stuffed with shredded chicken, beans, and melted cheddar, served with salsa.

# A Quick Recap

A healthy, personalized diet is a crucial part of managing prediabetes. Focusing on fiber-rich foods, lean proteins, and healthy fats can help you effectively control blood sugar and feel full for longer.

Be sure to talk to your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to get specific advice tailored to your situation!

Let’s Talk Real Solutions,"Starting a business in the UAE isn’t just about paperwork and stamps—it’s about taking that leap. The kind where you decide that now’s the time to build something on your terms. And let’s be honest, that leap can feel a little scary.

But here’s the thing—when you’ve got the right team on your side, like **Rapid Business Solution**, setting up in the UAE mainland doesn’t just feel doable. It feels like a smart move.

So, whether you’re a bootstrapped startup with a wild idea, a growing e-commerce brand looking to localize, or an established firm ready to expand into one of the world’s most business-friendly zones—keep reading. This isn’t just another “business setup” article. This is your unofficial how-to from someone who’s seen behind the scenes.

https://preview.redd.it/7szem9qzbf6f1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=62b07e147016d6b78aa1d05199f62832517e97db

# Why Mainland? Why Not Just Free Zone?

Okay, let’s clear this up. Free zones are great—until they aren’t. If you’re planning to only sell within the free zone or internationally, that might work. But what if you want to trade directly with UAE’s massive local market? Or open a retail shop in Deira? Or pitch your services to a Dubai-based client face-to-face?

That’s where **mainland business setup** makes all the difference.

**Mainland means freedom**—to operate anywhere in the UAE, take on government contracts, or scale without red tape. No sponsor restrictions anymore either (yes, that changed!). And if you’re building a brand with long-term roots in the region? Mainland’s the way to go.

# So, Where Does Rapid Business Solution Fit In?

Short answer: everywhere.

Long answer? They’re like that one friend who actually reads the terms and conditions so you don’t have to. From company name approval and MOA drafting to license issuance and local office requirements—they handle the mess so you can focus on, well, your actual business.

# Here’s what they really help with (and yes, it’s a lot):

* **Choosing the right legal structure** – Sole proprietorship? LLC? Civil company? It’s not one-size-fits-all.  
* **License procurement** – Commercial, industrial, professional—each one has strings attached.  
* **Local service agent (if needed)** – No shady deals, just solid compliance.  
* **Office space assistance** – Need a physical office to meet legal requirements? They’ll help you snag the right one.  
* **Visa processing** – For you, your team, and your dependents. No unnecessary loops.  
* **Bank account coordination** – Opening a business bank account in the UAE can be a maze. They know the shortcuts.  

And the thing is—they don’t just tick boxes. They ask you the right questions, sometimes ones you haven’t even thought of. That’s rare.

# Not Just for Corporates—Even Solopreneurs Can Think Mainland

Here’s a plot twist most freelancers don’t know: you *can* register a mainland company in your own name and go completely legit. Writers, digital marketers, consultants, developers—it’s all fair game.

So if you’ve been sending invoices through PayPal and praying your client doesn’t ask for a TRN? Maybe it’s time to switch things up.

Rapid Business Solution helps freelancers get set up under professional licenses, which means:

* You keep 100% ownership.  
* You operate like a real business.  
* You can get visas, open business bank accounts, and pitch to companies confidently.  

It’s like going from a rented desk in a coffee shop to owning your name on the door.

# A Little About Timelines, Costs, and Expectations

Let’s be real—it’s not a “click and done” process. Mainland setup takes a bit more effort than opening a social media account. But it’s far from impossible.

With Rapid Business Solution, most setups take between **5 to 12 working days** depending on the business activity and documentation.

**Cost-wise**, it varies. But don’t let random Google searches scare you. Rapid breaks it down clearly:

* Government fees? Transparent.  
* Consultancy charges? Fixed.  
* Hidden costs? Zero.  

And if you’re working with a tight budget? They’ll tell you honestly whether now’s the right time—or what you can tweak to make it work.

# Trends You Shouldn’t Ignore (Because They Matter)

Just a quick tangent—because context matters.

The UAE has been pivoting hard toward tech, green businesses, and knowledge-based industries. That means:

* **E-commerce licenses are booming.**  
* **Fintech and SaaS setups are gaining traction.**  
* **AI, Web3, and digital assets? Yep, they're on the radar.**  

Mainland licenses let you tap into all of that—especially if you want partnerships, government projects, or investor visibility.

Rapid Business Solution keeps tabs on these shifts, so they won’t recommend something outdated. They’ve helped businesses register for cloud kitchens, virtual offices, fintech consultancies—you name it.

# A Word on Paperwork (Because It’s the Boring Part That Matters)

You’ll need:

* Passport copies  
* Emirates ID (if you already live here)  
* Proof of address  
* No objection letters (in some cases)  
* Business activity approval  
* Initial trade name reservation  

Don’t worry if this list made your eyes glaze over. Rapid sorts it all.

But what’s even more valuable? They **educate** along the way—so you're not left clueless when someone from the bank asks for your trade license copy or a VAT certificate down the line.

# Real Talk: Is It Worth It?

If you’re building a business you want to *actually grow*, then yes—mainland setup is worth every minute and every dirham.

It’s not the cheapest route upfront. But it’s flexible, future-proof, and credible. And in the UAE, credibility opens doors faster than discounts.

With a partner like Rapid Business Solution, you’re not just ticking off legal requirements. You’re building the foundation of something legit—without the trial-and-error stress.

# Final Thoughts (Or... Things You’ll Thank Yourself For Later)

* **Don’t DIY everything.** YouTube is great for baking recipes, not for navigating UAE company law.  
* **Think long-term.** Choose a structure and license that gives you room to scale.  
* **Ask questions.** Even the weird ones—Rapid has probably heard them before.  
* **Start small, but think big.** Even one-man businesses can thrive on the mainland.  

Setting up a business in Dubai or anywhere in the UAE mainland isn’t just about location—it’s about *intention*. And if your intention is to grow, earn, and stay… then start on the right foot.

Honestly, having someone like Rapid Business Solution in your corner? It’s like having cheat codes in a game you actually care about winning.

Gonna try this again. 

If you’ve ever screamed internally while pretending to be normal, accidentally trauma-dumped on a new friend, or spent six hours hyperfixating on your D&D character’s tragic backstory… this post is for you.

A bit about me:
I’m turning 30 this year (cue dramatic music) and have been on a journey of self-discovery, healing, and figuring out how to build a life that feels actually good™. Been leveling up in therapy, investing stat points into self-love, and finally learned how to make a breakfast that isn’t just coffee and vibes.

But despite all that, I’ve realized something’s missing—people. My people. Fellow weirdos.
So here I am, casting Summon Internet Friends at 9th level.

Looking for:
	•	Fellow queer, neurodivergent, artistic goblins
	•	People who like to talk regularly, whether it’s deep convos, chaotic memes, or “look at this cursed item I just found in Baldur’s Gate”
	•	Creatives! I’m a writer—if you draw, paint, write, or cosplay, let’s trade inspo!
	•	Bonus points if you’re into D&D, TTRPGs, cozy/indie games, or just screaming about your OC’s trauma arc at 2am
	•	Furries welcome—if you have a sona, I already want to know everything about them
	•	Age range: ideally 25-35ish, but 21+ is the only hard rule. Any time zone is cool with me if it’s cool with you.

I’m not expecting overnight besties, but I am hoping to build real, long-term friendships. The kind where we accidentally stay up till 4am talking about life, drop hype in each other’s inboxes, and maybe even co-write chaotic worldbuilding lore for no reason other than fun.

If you made it this far, you’re probably at least a little weird. So what are you waiting for? Slide into my DMs like a bard with maxed-out Charisma and zero impulse control.

Let’s make magic together ✨
