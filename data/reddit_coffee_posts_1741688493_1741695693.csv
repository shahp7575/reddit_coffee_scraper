morning exercise:

scout runs for an hour each morning at his top speed to keep his stamina 

solly does 100 pushups, 100 pullups and 100 squats and runs for 10 minutes

pyro exercises in their room to aerobics and they forced the whole team to dance with them at some point (thats why the whole team knows mannrobics)

demo just tries not to throw up and sometimes does balance exercises mandated by medic

heavy benches and squats the weight of all the mercs combined (along with their guns)
engie stretches and does the farmer bucket workout thingy so he can run on the battlefield with his heavy ass machinery

medic meticulously stretches every muscle which takes him over an hour each day and then does 4 laps around the base so he can keep up with the team

sniper's workout is making it to the coffee machine :)

spy tells the whole team he exercises like a normal person but in fact does pilates as it strengthens his core and stamina (if the team found out he would be dead)


breakfast:
scout eats the most out of the whole team and prefers overcooked scrambled eggs. medic has to force him every day to eat vegetables

soldier asked medic to make him a meal plan with the most protein and a small caloric surplus so he gains good muscle. he always eats his share and never asks for more even if he is hungry sometimes. pancakes, bacon and syrup RAAH ü¶Ö 

pyro is the one who cooks for the team,  they are skilled in the kitchen and sometimes switch shifts with engie. they mostly drink big ass smoothies and have hardboiled eggs as a side. they love to eat sprinkles as a dessert when medic allows them :3

demo struggles to eat in the morning but solly supports him and sometimes even feeds him when the drunk is almost passed out. demo loves to drink black tea for his hangover, and usually only stomachs bread with a bit of butter

heavy eats the ultimate slavic breakfast: raw bacon, glass of milk, a few pieces of bread, tomatoes and cucumbers, sometimes substituted for pickles. he sometimes even brings out his homemade kompot and shares with the team, especially when they have pancakes for breakfast

engie doesnt eat much in the morning as well, but is generally able to eat more than demo. his breakfast consist of fried eggs, bacon, cheese and toasted bread, and he drinks orange juice with it

medic has a balanced diet, often sharing a smoothie with pyro for the health benefits and eats veggies like cucumber, tomato and even avocado (the team laughs at his that he is turning into a girl and he is so pissed yelling at them that he eats it for the health benefits) his protein of choice is lean ham.

sniper usually eats cereal or toast with honey to sweeten his second cup of black coffee

spy has the most conplicated meal requests but surprisingly pyro is able to prepare them. he eats eggs benedict, french toast with a lot of fruits and berries, charcutterie with expensive meats and cheeses and gets irritated when scout steals a few pieces from him but ultimately lets him have them

In an attempt to cheer me up, he wrote this. I appreciate the effort, but it made me realize something‚ÄîI don‚Äôt long for grand gestures or romantic words. I just want normalcy. Trust, security, the everyday things that shouldn‚Äôt feel out of reach. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to see how deep I‚Äôve sunk, craving what should have been there all along.

This made me feel a bit better, but the sadness is still there. The doubts are still there. I know it's too soon and the wound is too fresh, but it really fkn sucks. Am I being too harsh on myself? Should I let go a bit and really allow myself to trust these words?

""My love,

I know you‚Äôre not doing well, and I understand. It makes me so sad to see you like this and to know that I‚Äôm the reason.

But today, I want to try something‚ÄîI want to make you smile. It won‚Äôt be easy, but I accept the challenge. So, I‚Äôll talk to you about what our relationship could be.

First and most importantly, it‚Äôs a relationship built on love and trust. Imagine yourself in the future, sitting on a beach or in a bar, and I only have eyes for you. All my attention is on you. We talk about everything and nothing, and in your eyes, I see affection. I go to the bar to get us drinks, and as you watch me from afar, you feel at peace, because that‚Äôs how things should be‚Äîcomforting and secure.

I come back to our table, hand you your drink, and say something silly, as I always do. You laugh and say, ‚ÄúWhat an idiot!‚Äù We laugh together and continue our conversation. I move closer, rest my hand on your leg, and it feels natural. I whisper that ‚Äúsomething just woke up,‚Äù and you burst out laughing, calling me a ‚Äúperv!‚Äù We laugh again.

Another moment‚Äîwe‚Äôre in the city, walking around, and you say you want to stop by a makeup store. We go in, and you browse the products, perfumes, everything. You ask for my opinion. I tell you you‚Äôre beautiful, stunning, and that you smell amazing. You reply, ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not even wearing perfume,‚Äù and I smile and say, ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù You give me that half-amused, half-exasperated look that I love.

We come home, and our dog greets us excitedly. We both kneel down to give him attention. It‚Äôs adorable, and you get the idea to make him ""talk""‚Äîhe barks back at you enthusiastically, and we laugh because he‚Äôs such a little character.

Another scene‚Äîit‚Äôs Saturday morning. I wake up before you, and as you slowly stir, pupper snuggles up to you for cuddles. The sun is out, the bedroom window is slightly open, and you feel the cool morning air while staying warm under the blanket. You hear me moving around in the kitchen. I quietly open the door with a hot cup of coffee, and he crawls toward me for his turn at getting affection. It‚Äôs adorable, and we laugh. You show me your latest find, and we start planning the day ahead. It‚Äôs going to be a good day.

In every moment, we‚Äôre together, with our pup, and you feel peace and security. As for me, I‚Äôm completely in love with you, I only see you, and I only want to be with you. I love you.""",1,1741694003.0,loveafterporn,1,1.0,False
1j8owzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j8owzg/i_think_my_house_is_trying_to_tell_me_something/,I think my house is trying to tell me something,"
I‚Äôm not sure where else to turn, so I‚Äôm posting this here. Maybe someone can help me make sense of what‚Äôs happening, or at least tell me I‚Äôm not losing my mind. It all started about a month ago, and since then, things have only gotten worse.

I live in a small, old house on the outskirts of town. It‚Äôs nothing fancy, just a cozy place I inherited from my grandparents. I‚Äôve always felt safe here, surrounded by memories of family gatherings and warm summer nights. But lately, that sense of safety has been slipping away, replaced by a creeping dread I can‚Äôt shake.

The First Signs
It began with the noises. At first, it was just faint whispers in the dead of night, like the wind rustling through the trees. I told myself it was nothing, probably just the house settling or my imagination playing tricks. But the whispers grew louder, more insistent, as if they were trying to tell me something. I‚Äôd lie in bed, straining to make out the words, but they were always just out of reach‚Äîa maddening murmur that kept me awake for hours.

Then, things started moving on their own. I‚Äôd leave a book on the coffee table, only to find it on the kitchen counter the next morning. My keys would disappear from their usual spot by the door and turn up in the bathroom sink. I thought maybe I was being forgetful, but deep down, I knew something was off. It was as if the house itself was shifting, playing some twisted game with me.

The Feeling of Being Watched
I tried to ignore it, to go about my daily routine as if everything was normal. But the feeling of being watched was inescapable. I‚Äôd catch glimpses of shadows darting in the corners of my vision, always gone when I turned to look. The air felt heavy, charged with an unseen presence that made my skin crawl.

Desperate for answers, I set up a camera in the living room, hoping to catch whatever was causing these disturbances. For days, nothing happened. The footage showed only the quiet, empty room, bathed in the soft glow of the lamp I left on. But then, one night, I saw it.

The Figure
I was reviewing the footage from the previous evening when a flicker of movement caught my eye. At first, it was just a blur, a smudge on the screen that could have been a glitch. But as I watched, the blur coalesced into a shape‚Äîa figure, translucent and wavering, standing in the center of the room. It was humanoid, but its features were indistinct, like a reflection in a rippling pond. The figure seemed to be looking directly at the camera, its head tilted as if in curiosity.

My heart pounded as I stared at the screen, unable to tear my eyes away. The figure lingered for a few seconds before dissolving back into the shadows, leaving the room empty once more. I replayed the footage over and over, trying to convince myself it was a trick of the light or a fault in the camera. But the more I watched, the more certain I became: something was in my house, something not of this world.

Digging into the Past
I decided to dig deeper, to see if there was any history of strange occurrences in the house. My grandparents had never mentioned anything unusual, but maybe there was something they didn‚Äôt know. I spent hours at the local library, poring over old newspapers and town records. What I found chilled me to the bone.

Decades ago, before my grandparents bought the house, it had been the site of a tragic accident. 
A young woman had lived there alone, and one winter night, she vanished without a trace. Search parties combed the area, but no sign of her was ever found. 

The case went cold, and the house sat empty for years until my grandparents moved in.

The article included a grainy photograph of the woman, and as I looked at it, a shiver ran down my spine. There was something familiar about her, something I couldn‚Äôt quite place. Then it hit me the figure in the camera footage. The shape, the posture it was her.

A Plea from Beyond

That night, I lay in bed, the weight of this revelation pressing down on me. If the spirit of this woman was haunting my house, what did she want? Was she trying to communicate, to tell me something about her disappearance? Or was there something more sinister at play?

The whispers returned, louder than ever, and this time, I could almost make out the words. ‚ÄúFind me,‚Äù they seemed to say, over and over, a desperate plea from beyond the grave. I squeezed my eyes shut, willing the voices to stop, but they only grew more insistent.

Suddenly, a cold hand gripped my ankle, yanking me down the bed with terrifying force. I screamed, thrashing against the unseen assailant, but my limbs felt heavy, as if bound by invisible chains. 

The room spun, and a wave of nausea washed over me as the whispers crescendoed into a deafening roar.

Just as quickly as it began, the assault ceased. I was alone again, trembling in the darkness, my heart racing. The air was still, the whispers gone, but the sense of dread lingered, thicker than ever.

Time Is Running Out

I knew then that I couldn‚Äôt ignore this any longer. Whatever was in my house, it was growing stronger, more aggressive. I had to find out what happened to that woman, to uncover the truth behind her disappearance. Maybe then, I could put her spirit to rest and reclaim my home.

But as I sit here typing this, I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm being watched. The shadows in the corners of the room seem to pulse and shift, and the whispers have started again, soft but persistent. ‚ÄúFind me,‚Äù they say, ‚Äúbefore it‚Äôs too late.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure what that means, but I fear that time is running out. For both of us.

What do you think? Has anyone experienced anything like this? I need advice, or at least some reassurance that I‚Äôm not alone in this nightmare.",2,1741693912.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

  Here‚Äôs a story telling how inadvertently turned my innocent wife into an insatiable stoner slut.

  First off I‚Äôll describe my wife. She is blonde, 5‚Äô4‚Äù, 36C breasts,  and an immaculate ass. We have been together since high school and got married right out of college. She grew up in a strict Christian household while I grew up with very laid back hippie parents, needless to say her parents weren‚Äôt too thrilled by her choice of a husband but they dealt with it. I was a huge stoner in high school and part of college, she was not and refused to smoke due to her beliefs. So I never pressed the issue, she didn‚Äôt really care as long as I didn‚Äôt do it around her. Halfway through college though I quit smoking to focus more on school and she was so proud of me that it really didn‚Äôt bother me at the time to give up something I loved. 

  Flash forward: we have both graduated college, have a nice apartment in the city, and are starting to develop a nice routine. She is a high school English teacher and I work at a local law firm building my way up the ladder. Our sec life wasn‚Äôt bad per se, we had sex once a week or two but something was missing and I started to feel like I was in a rut. While I was still insanely attracted to her, the spontaneity and passion was dwindling and I didn‚Äôt know what to do. 

  I started to get anxiety and resorted back to smoking weed every now and then just to take the edge off. I didn‚Äôt tell my wife because I knew it would really upset her, like I said she came from a very religious background and was so happy when I decided to quit. This continued for a couple months and one Friday night I had smoked a little too much before I came home from the office and got just a bit too faded. I told her that I was just exhausted when I got home and wanted to go to bed, mostly so she couldn‚Äôt tell how high I was. 

  I woke up the next morning and she wasn‚Äôt in bed, which was incredibly odd. But I thought maybe she hadn‚Äôt been able to sleep and just took a walk which she was know to do from time to time. I got up and made some coffee and walked by the entrance to our living room when I noticed her just sitting in the living room, she was sitting on the ground with her head down in her hands. I ran in and asked her what was wrong, she slowly looked up at me with tears in her eyes and a mix of mostly sadness and a little anger.

   I asked her again what was wrong and she tossed me my jacket and said ‚Äú you forgot to hang up your jacket, you just tossed it on the chair when you got home last night. I laughed a little and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry honey, but why would that upset you so badly?‚Äù She looked at me and said ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt‚Äù holding out her hand she was holding something and said ‚Äúthis fell out of your pocket onto the chair‚Äù she was holding my pipe and lighter. My heart sank, I felt awful. I tried to explain everything to her from feeling in a rut, the anxiety, and not feeling passion anymore. 

  She didn‚Äôt say anything for a moment, then said ‚Äúwhy wouldn‚Äôt you just tell me all of this?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy hide it?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat hurts more than anything‚Äù I sand down, then looked at her and said, ‚ÄúI was embarrassed, I guess? I was afraid you would think I wasn‚Äôt happy with you or attracted to you anymore?‚Äù ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt want to hurt you, but I hurt you anyway‚Äù she looked at me, then at the pipe, ‚Äú I thought you quit smoking marijuana, I was so proud of you‚Äù I told her that it wasn‚Äôt evil or bad and that it actually helped my anxiety. 

  She said that she just didn‚Äôt want me addicted to drugs, to which I tried to explain to her how it‚Äôs not a hard drug like she was taught in church and could be used medicinally. I finally said ‚Äúif you just tried it, you‚Äôd see that it‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù I knew she wouldn‚Äôt because she had said long ago that she would never do drugs of any kind, she wouldn‚Äôt even drink alcohol. So imagine my shock when she said ‚Äúfine, I‚Äôll try it then‚Äù I looked at her astonished and could only say ‚Äúwait, what?‚Äù She said that obviously it was something that was important to me and if she was going to understand it then she should at least try it once. I was so excited that I didn‚Äôt know what to say or do, and also for some reason, it REALLY turned me on for some reason, just the thought of my shy, innocent wife doing something so‚Ä¶ bad, I was instantly getting an erection. So finally I said, ‚Äúo-ok, when do you want to try it?‚Äù She said ‚Äúwhy not now?‚Äù 
 
  I gathered all my stuff, and sat down beside her, I could tell she was nervous as I was packing the pipe and handed it to her. She looked at the pipe examining it then looked up and said ‚Äúok, how to I do it?‚Äù I instructed her to put the pipe to her mouth, put her thumb over the carb hole, lit it and told her to breathe in, after a second I told her to move her thumb and she sucked in a decent amount of smoke. Of course she immediately started coughing her poor lungs out so I went to the kitchen to get her some water. When I got back she was sitting there with a small grin and glazed look in her eyes. I asked her how she felt and she looked up and said ‚ÄúI feel like, floaty, it‚Äôs nice‚Äù and giggled a little. I said ‚Äúoh yeah? You want to try again? She giggled a little and nodded her head. So gave her the pipe again and lit it for her, this time she took a nice sized hit and held it like a champ, then slowly exhaled. I couldn‚Äôt believe how turned on I was, just seeing her exhale the smoke was driving me crazy. She apparently noticed that I was excited and looked up at me and said ‚Äúlooks like someone is excited‚Äù I nodded and smiled at her. 

  Whenever we have sex, it‚Äôs always vanilla. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, my wife is gorgeous but we mostly have a little foreplay, nothing crazy, then it‚Äôs missionary till we‚Äôre done. So imagine my shock when she yanked my shorts down and started voraciously sucking my dick, which is something she NEVER does. She was going at it like she was on death row and it was her last meal. I was in heaven. I pull her shirt off exposing her perfect tits and started licking and sucking them while she played with herself, which is another thing she rarely did. I stood her up and started kissing her then she turned around and bent over the couch, shaking her ass at me, I had always wanted to do her doggy style but she was never into it, but now she was borderline begging for it. I slid inside her and started fucking her from behind and she started moaning, which turned me on even more so I pounded harder after a few minutes she said ‚Äúfuck me harder, I‚Äôm gonna cum‚Äù I had never heard her cuss before and it sent me over the edge as we both convulsed and came together. Afterwards we both laid naked on the floor of the living room, she still had a huge grin on her face and I noticed that she was still playing with herself, so I moved myself down between her legs and started eating her out, which I had never done before because she was too uncomfortable with me doing. She came hard and squirted all over my face. 

  After a few minutes she looked over at me still glazed and said ‚Äú I‚Äôm so fucking hungry‚Äù I had to laugh hearing her talk like that, so I got up and ordered us some pizza. About a half hour went by and I was in the bathroom when I heard the doorbell ring, I said ‚Äúhoney, that‚Äôs the pizza, can you get the door?‚Äù She said yes. I heard the doorbell ring open and small talk, then the pizza guy laughed and said something, then the door closed. When I got into the living room, my wife was sitting on the floor, still completely naked, and eating pizza. I said ‚Äúholy shit! Did you answer the door like that?‚Äù She looked at me a little confused and then looked down at herself and looked mortified and said ‚Äúoh my god! I can‚Äôt believe I just did that! I feel terrible!‚Äù I laughed and told her it was fine and that the pizza guy got a hell of a tip. She said it wasn‚Äôt funny and seemed really embarrassed, which told me that the weed was wearing off.

   I told her that I was sorry for laughing and we spent the rest of the day doing nothing. The next day we got up and she was back to her perfect, innocent self like yesterday hadn‚Äôt even happened. I walked up and hugged her from behind and said ‚ÄúWell? How was it?‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow was what?‚Äù She asked. I rolled my eyes and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre first time smoking weed!‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was ok‚Äù she said, ‚Äúnot as bad as I thought it would be‚Äù I jumped back a little and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it?‚Äù ‚ÄúJust ok?‚Äù She just kind of shrugged and said ‚Äúyeah, it wasn‚Äôt too bad‚Äù I just shook my head.

  That night laying in bed I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how much it turned me on to see her smoke weed and even more surprising, how much more it turned me on than another guy saw her naked. Which gave me an idea.",0,1741693617.0,cheating_stories,1,0.25,False

I went the ""traditional"" route first. Insert cliche ""I did everything right.""

I picked the girl who, honestly, was not a Victoria Secret model but who had an amazing smile, was religious and stable. We agreed that she would stay home, and she did. We had the standard two kids together with a white picket fence. We were just your standard, middle-class family. We were worrying about how to pay for the kids college. I was working too much.

I was 49 when I found out about my wife's emotional affair. I tried to make the marriage work, went to extensive couples and individual counseling, none of it worked. I imagined dying with her, and now, I felt as though I was dying to be away from her. Ironically, one of the investments I made early in my career took off at the same time, and we went from middle-class to part of the 1%. Quickly. I bought a house as far as I could from her and planned to spend half my time there and half my time at home to keep a stable home environment for the (adult) kids to have Christmas, etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I was five years into this. Then I met Kate. I was in a coffee shop. She comments on my comic book, yes, I a 55 year old man was reading a comic book. Which is exactly what she commented on. We ended up laughing the better part of the day, and honestly, I haven't stopped since.

Everything that was lacking in my marriage came from Kate... well almost everything. My ex-wife did not drink. Kate did. My ex-wife did not understand my Machiavellian side, Kate did. My ex-wife did not seem to understand my ""quirks"" which Kate just calls ""stimming"" because, as she has taught me, we are both autistic. Kate loved nothing more than understanding and playing with peoples minds, something I loved too. Something I never thought I would share with anyone.

Plus, Kate was everything that was great about my marriage, too. The only line Kate, and frankly I drew, was that Kate was ""not cut out to be a mistress"" -- so nothing romantic. She would say this teasingly, especially as we both acknowledged romantic feelings growing between us. And, yes, somewhat shamefully there were a few nights where we had sex before I was divorced. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I got a divorce. It wasn't for Kate, per se, but it was because of her. I had hope. Joy. The divorce was terrible, and I would have left me, but through it all, Kate stayed by my side.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Kate works her own full-time job that requires a doctorate degree and earns more than I did when I was her age, even accounting for inflation.

She is also one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. When she walks into a restaurant or bar to go pick up food, everyone looks at her. I truly cannot believe I got the full package most days. 

I believed the phrase ""no one can be all things to someone else"" it is how I survived the years in my marriage before her. I no longer believe that.

Kate is kind and giving. She has made a genuine effort with my kids and has honestly supported them through so much. She is especially respectful of my relationship with my daughter.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Still, I get backlash from old mutual friends of my ex-wife or neighbors. Sometimes, people post mean things on our door.

- A coffee shop (I've tried both Tinker and Command, so something different than those would be nice)
- a bookstore or three
- somewhere to get lunch ($15 or less a person if that's possible in today's world, but I'll look into anything if it's good)
- something eclectic (art, records, plants, vintage clothes, etc..etc,.)

yesterday morning i left to get coffee before starting my day, and when i got home, i got a notification that there was an unknown airtag traveling with me. (i dont even own an airtag) since i am a girl who goes out alone often, this was startling. 

it showed my entire route i had taken for coffee on find my iphone.

i wasnt sure if someone had snuck an airtag somewhere on or in my car while i was out, so i let my family know. my brother has 3 airtags, so i asked if he put one in my car, but the answer was no. 

we looked everywhere in and out of my car for HOURS. it took all day for this. we tried using the play a sound feature but that didnt work either. we tested it on my brothers airtags but it wasnt those. 

so, we called the non emergency line. told them that we werent sure if i was tagged by somebody in my town or something. we asked them if there was any way they could find it, but the answer was no. if we did find it however, they then said they would be able to do something about it. 

so since that didnt work, i called apple support, they helped me learn that you cant disable an airtag unless you find it, which is INSANE to me, and extremely dangerous. i didnt know that this was a thing because i do not own one. it took 44 minutes on the phone with them to learn that. 

so, as of now, the airtag is still not found, but the location has still been updating at my house, where my car is parked. am i just supposed to ignore it and hope nothing happens? is it a glitch that my phone is doing? i am so confused. ",1,1741692847.0,AirTags,3,1.0,False

<div>When it comes to designing an inviting and functional space, a furniture set den can be the focal point of your home. A den serves as a cozy retreat, and the right furniture set can transform this space into a stylish haven for relaxation or social gatherings. Exploring the options for a furniture set specifically tailored for dens can enhance both comfort and aesthetics.

Choosing the perfect furniture set for your den involves considering several factors:

- **Layout:** The arrangement of furniture should facilitate conversation and accessibility. Sofas and chairs arranged in a U-shape or L-shape can create an intimate setting.
- **Style:** Opt for a design that complements your home's overall theme. Whether you prefer modern, rustic, or traditional styles, there is a furniture set for every taste.
- **Functionality:** Consider multifunctional pieces such as ottomans with storage, nest tables, or pull-out sofas that offer additional sleeping space for guests.
- **Comfort:** Since a den is meant for relaxation, choosing plush fabrics and supportive seating is crucial. Look for high-density foam cushions and durable materials.
- **Color Scheme:** The color of your furniture set can set the mood of your den. Soft, neutral tones create a calming atmosphere, while vibrant hues can energize the space.

Investing in a quality furniture set den not only enhances the comfort of your space but also positively impacts the overall aesthetic. Look for collections that include matching sofas, accent chairs, and decorative elements like coffee tables or shelving units. This cohesive approach ensures that your den is both functional and visually striking.

Incorporating personal touches, such as art and decorative pillows, can further enrich the ambiance of your den, making it a true reflection of your personality. In summary, a well-chosen furniture set den is essential for creating a welcoming atmosphere that invites relaxation and fosters connection with family and friends.

1j8odre,https://www.reddit.com/r/cro/comments/1j8odre/my_thoughts_on_the_current_situation_a_more/,"My thoughts on the current situation, a more optimistic view","Hello,

I've been pretty hesitant to write this since obviously currently the narrative is that ""KRIS IS STEALING OUR MONEY"" and I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion and called ""paid shiller"" but in case someone is interesting in different POV.. 

Let me start by saying that I've invested in CDC (former MONACO) shortly after their ICO, so basically late 2017, early 2018 if I remember correctly.  
  
I've been here for long time, really, and every now and then there is such a weird sentiment that makes me wonder who and why people invest in this coin at all? Do you even do any kind if research, read whitepaper or just invest because some guy on youtube/twitter told you so and now that CRO is not doing 1000x as they promised so they are scammers and so on?

Let's address the MCO -> CRO swap first. If you have been here as long as me, and done your research - you would know that originally, CDC was only interested in ""making cryptocurrency available in every wallet"" or something like that was the slogan.. This was done via the partnership with VISA, and the cards we have today.   
  
In that time, the company was competing again TenX, wirex and others that had the same idea. Long story short, TenX went bankrupt, wirex is really not an important player so clearly CDC delivered on this, not having first mover advantage, TenX was available before CDC and probably ""the most promising"" card <-> crypto at that time with their own PAY token. So **IMHO its important to notice that CDC team delivered and beat the competition.**

Fast forward a bit, incomes the MCO -> CRO swap where people never understood this, I believe to this day - and I think the similar thing is happening here with the newly mint. If you want your company to scale, you need a lot more liquidity than MCO offered and the company didn't hold significant %, same as CRO today. So, to put it plain, in order for CDC to offer everything they offer today, you'd either end up with 2 coins:

MCO for visa cards only  
CRO for blockchain transactions

or

simplify it and merge it all to CRO which is what they did.. Was the trade 1MCO : 27CRO favorable at the moment? **Probably not**, but was it a good strategy in the long run? **Yes, otherwise it would be very chaotic (do you buy MCO or CRO, what to offer with each, etc..) and liquidity would be low, which means CDC wouldn't be able to scale.**

The reason why I'm writing this is because at that time, the people had exact same sentiment ""Kris is taking our money"", only for CRO to grow from 0.01$ to 0.9$ at ATH implementing many things like loans, 2 blockchains, nft marketplace, many partnerships with established brands, etc.. So again, **important to notice is that CDC team delivered, and CRO had a rise of almost 9000% to ATH from 0.01$ to 0.9$**

After that, comes the winter and CDC was the first team to scale down the rewards on visa card. What happens then, the same sentiment -> ""Kris is taking our money, this is how they pay for partnerships, etc, etc.."", but if we are being honest, there was simply no interest in crypto during the winter, and the companies that didn't scale down, what happened to them? See Celsius, 3AC, Voyager and others that had ties to FTX like BlockFi and more.. Again, while the decision to scale down rewards **was not popular**, in hindsight it was obviously **a correct move**. 

Now comes this new proposal to mint, and [here](https://github.com/crypto-org-chain/chain-main/discussions/1124#discussioncomment-12371904) is my initial reaction (see my username matches).Its safe to say I was emotional and didn't think this through, but if you set aside the emotions and ego - the CDC:

1 Surrounded by millionaires/billionaires and in talk/doing business with the on daily level  
2 Have a seat at White House stuff related to crypto  
3 Survived many years in the most volatile business space

If you think that the CDC team didn't know this was going to be the reaction from the team then you are very naive. Still, they've done it, why? 

Because, IMHO, this is the next step to scale the company - the following is obviously **HIGHLY SPECULATIVE and WISHFUL THINKING**, but IMHO given the background of CDC leadership way more closer than ""Kris is taking our money"". 

Look at the CDC roadmap, a lot of these things require severe liquidity in hands of CDC like:

1 Crypto.com Stablecoin, 1 Second, 1 Cent Global Transfers - what if CRO can have a major role there  
2 Rewards on Bitcoin - What if CRO staking could unlock BTC rewards on their Visa cards, making it one of the most attractive cashback programs  
3 Cronos - currently the blockchain situation is **VERY VERY SAD,** the CRO can be used as an incentive for developers or already existing players to join/move to cronos  
  
\+ many more in the roadmap like AI stuff

Alongside that, the CDC was invited to the White House and posting stuff directly in relation to the new government in USA, what if they are already having some business in negotiations? Surely the didn't invite them to drink coffee? 

Again, **HIGHLY SPECULATIVE and WISHFUL THINKING** but what if CRO can play a part in:

1 RWA - imagine you can tokenize real estate, gold, oil or other commodities¬†  
2 Institutional lending - where big players want to lend 50M$ in stablecoins but instead of giving BTC or ETH, they can give CRO  
3 CRO ETF - basically this is ""confirmed"" since its in roadmap

And again, many more options are possible, who knows? 

1 To be completely honest, the reason I'm typing this post was because some guy on x said ""remove assets from CDC, ""rumors are they are cooked"".. If you look at the exchange volume and the fact that they are now allowed to work in USA, arguably they have more than ever profits - just showing how idiotic the people on twitter are and why you should not blindly trust them.. DYOR and if you think CDC is cooked, its 1000% fine, move on, but make it make sense, don't just say random shit. 

2 Also a lot of people are saying why didn't they buy 5B$ of CRO, but as a business why would they if they can get it for free? We all know what would've happened then, a quick pump n dump where some of us would insta sell :D yeah it would pump our bags, but a huge red candle would follow - **this way, its 70B over 5 years, not at once** which makes it a ""bit better"".

TLDR; Many times in the past people were chatting shit and spreading FUD without knowing anything, often the moves that are unpopular **(like minting 70B coins over 5 years, so basically \~1.1B / month)** can also have a positive impact.  
  
Guaranteed, this will either make or break the coin since its radical move **(yes, its likely that things go REALLY BAD if CDC does not deliver)**, but don't all jump on the ""CDC IS COOKED, KRIS IS STEALING OUR MONEY, IN 10 DAYS ITS 230% DILUTION"" without doing the research.

Lastly, because people are crying about decentralization, if you don't understand that ONLY BTC is really decentralized, you should probably go back to learning the fundamentals, no offense. :) ",18,1741691923.0,cro,11,0.91,False

1j8od2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UrethralStrictureAid/comments/1j8od2g/just_had_dviu_optilume_what_to_avoid_feel_free_to/,Just had DVIU & OPTILUME  - What to avoid ? Feel free to ask any questions.,"Just had the catheter removed (11/03/2025), I only saw the surgeon prior to treatment on Friday (7/03/2025) briefly (for 5 mins). I did not get to see him after, I was told I could ask questions after. I guess I get to see him in 3 months for a check up, so I'm not sure of their findings e.g. if it was longer than anticipated or what balloon was used. I kind of wanted to know the details.

All I was told by the nurse is that the bladder diverticulum had no cancer or stones inside, and that urethral stricture was removed.

Using the urine bag Friday to Tuesday was not bad, just irritates your penis head. It was meant to be removed Monday, but they made an error with the paper work. Stupidly they forgot to give me any straps to hold the tube on so it kept moving which caused a lot of pain, so I tied something onto my thigh to stop the tube moving as it moved 3 or 4 times and blood came out over the weekend. Plus it moved in the shower and that was not fun. Make sure you got the correct thigh strap they forgot to give me. They gave me a sleeve to hold the bag, I got a 0.5 litre bag and 2 litre bag. They fill up quick. You don't even realise. Sometimes the tube gets blocked with air or blood, so I disconnected and reconnected.

Friday to Tuesday there was blood in my boxers and blood leaking out the gaps between the catheter and my penis. My prostate, perinium, testicles and epididymitis feel much better & less swollen than prior to treatment.  I can sit down without my balls or prostate swelling since Friday. I can't feel the epididymitis cyst at the moment which is good.

I've not yet urinated as my bladder was empty from the catheter, so I just drank 1 litres so will take a while. I also have a bladder diverticulum which most of you lucky people don't have, so my frequency will be unusual as it gets stuck in the punch.

I was told there was nothing to avoid doing, can carry on as normal on Monday when it is removed.  I thought you were not meant to drink booze or have sex for 1 month ? Or go gym, lift weights or ride a bike or motorbike ? No mention of sitting on a ring cushion ? No mention of sitting down max of 1 hour or max 1 hour driving. Really got told nothing.  I assume no spicy food or coffee.

I looked at post dviu and people seem to be told not to lift 5kg or more for 2 weeks. I had to lift 10kg on the day of surgery as I had a bag with lots of stuff, that caused discomfort with the catherer.

Procedure done in the UK, Milton Keynes. Was quick, maybe 30 mins he told me before I went in.

Not sure what else to right. Told no sex without a condom for 6 months. Chemo in your balls ? Maybe kids are off the cards now ? Which would be a shame as I'm 35 1/2 and really wanted some.

I've not tested my erection, but had 4 or 5 with the catheter in and that was not fun, but I assume that department is okay.

This surgeon, via NHS. The surgeon was very nice to talk to, seemed like a nice guy. No complaints. No drama or any issues. Went in 7am to hospital, lunch time operation and picked up by gf at 7 pm.

I will admit I did not sleep thursday from anxiety. I did not sleep Friday, Saturday , sunday or Monday due to fear of moving around and ripping the Cather out.  So hopefully I'm making sense still as I'm very tired. I was told to stay awake until tonight to make sure it does not close up and i still can urinate. Some people have closed up post catheter removal the nurse said, but she did not mention why or if they had a stricture etc.

My hopes are for 5 to 10 years free. Or for ever I hope. Hopefully something less invasive than uretha plasty by then.

I WILL CHECK AND REPSOND EVERY DAY AT THE END OF THE NIGHT OR DURING THE DAY WHEN I CAN.

For context: I'm currently studying for the theoretical exam for the drivers license in Germany. It's around 1200 questions in differing variations with videos, pictures, questions where you have to know numbers and so on and so forth. Altho I really see the good part in having a drivers license. I really want one. It's so boring to study this I struggle to stay awake. It's either me getting furious about the stupid
stupidity of the question cause I also have autism I struggle with every little incorrect detail or my mind goes blank. So I use every possible technique to focus. Go in the library, drink coffee to stay awake yet calm my mind. Eat random stuff. Set timers with enough breaks. I thought that my brain struggles like a little kid that doesn't wanna do homework so badly that it would rather eat dirt than do the dishes. So I thought making it fun like doing it with a child might help. If I was a mother and try to teach my child I'd tell it to read everything in detail and point those out to lecture the mean teachers who force you to answer those questions. It would make me way more focused to complain and make a freaking paper on it then just learn it. Even when it might take more time or paper. So i wrote down why it is unnecessary and so on and plan to write an essay about it which will force my brain to memorise the facts. 
It helps a little and I might use it with other stuff in a different way as well cause it also teaches writing skills in a smoother ways than analysing poems no one read in 600 years or so. 
Maybe someone wants to try out this technique or has some sort or experience with it and could advise more on it. Other than that, I'll just do it and if someone finds help in it I'd be happy.

Never thought I‚Äôd see her again

Puts on a bonnet of pins and

Says [MB & Julia Laws] I thought I‚Äôd find you much quicker than this, you

Must have thought I didn‚Äôt exist

Poor you - I do

We better go before your boyfriends cry

&nbsp;

She says she takes photos of tractor barns [bones?]

And sells them to model luxury homes

The closest thing she‚Äôs ever found to love

Is the kind you can‚Äôt get rid of fast enough

I make a three-egg omelet using just one spritz of olive oil, and I season it with salt, pepper, paprika, and onion powder. I usually pair my omelet with lots of veggies like cucumbers, tomatoes (which I sometimes sprinkle with salt, pepper, and dry mint), bell peppers, and lettuce. I also have a cup of coffee with skimmed milk and no sugar. I usually have it on low-carb days with 2 slices of whole wheat sugar free toast. But, when I'm carb cycling, I don't have toast. I also sometimes have 1 medjool date after my breakfast as a sweet treat (I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but this is just enough to satisfy any cravings).

On top of this, I work out four to five times a week, alternating between strength training and cardio. Thankfully, I‚Äôm now at a healthy weight, but I plan to lose 6 more pounds to reach my goal.

I though I'd share this breakfast because I¬†**truly**¬†believe that the first meal of the day sets the tone for everything that follows from energy levels to cravings.

That being said, I've been having this breakfast nearly every morning for the past two months, so I‚Äôm thinking it's time to switch things up a bit... Would love to hear what you guys eat on your low-carb days! üòä",6,1741690981.0,WeightLossAdvice,2,0.69,False

1j8o4h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1j8o4h7/3_weeks_in/,3 weeks in,"I'm 3 weeks 100% caffeine free.

I drank coffee for around 10 years. It started in college buying Costa coffees with a college friend and after experiencing that euphoria I was hooked.

Last year leading up to quitting I was drinking around 5 maybe 6 cups of coffee in cafes. I built up a huge tolerance but didn't really get anxious it was other stuff like nutrient absorption and dark circles and cortisol moon face and belly. Even having a few coffees affected my sleep quality and absorption of nutrients so then I switched to tea and green tea and felt better but quitting it all together has just levelled me up completely.

I switched to black tea and green tea and oscillated between the two for a couple months and tapered down. Switching to tea made the acid reflux go away. The last few days was green tea and the day before i quit was one cup of green tea.

I highly recommend switching to tea first if you're drinking coffee before you quit because to me it felt like the caffeine was different and you catch up on the sleep and pay off a lot of the 'sleep debt' without having major withdrawal symptoms and it made going cold turkey easier. It was an amazing 'step down' especially green tea.


The first few days I had ruminating thoughts and I felt like I had a grey filter over reality and it felt like it was never going to end. My head, specifically my forehead felt 'fried' but didn't hurt and had one dull headache that came then went and the 'fried' feeling persisted until 2 and half weeks in. 

My sleep was deep for the first few days and my body must of been exhausted. That's what it felt like but then I kept waking up in the middle of the night around 2am-4am every night but usually just had a bit of warm lemon water and honey and went back to bed.

I was a bit sluggish for 2 and half weeks then the feeling in my head lifted a bit and my sleep improved and my sex drive went through the roof and started sleeping 6hrs then a couple days ago around when I hit 3 weeks. I saw more improvement in my creativity and drive which I was relieved about because I'm a writer and love making art but I started waking up again in the middle of the night but my energy levels are sooo much better than when I first quit or even before. I feel like over time the sleep is going to improve but I'm going through a reboot.

I've had moments where I've felt naturally high and super present. Listening to the birds sing and feeling at one with the world and not completely wired. A profound sense of inner peace and tranquility being in my body.

Also my dark circles have faded significantly and the swelling in my face has gone down due to less cortisol and fat around my waist (one of the biggest reasons why i quit)

Haven't even made it to one month yet so I'm super excited to see what happens then!!

If you were like me and felt an intuitive nudge to quit caffeine please do it and see what happens. Your mind will fight you like crazy to begin with but if you push through you might be surprised to see how good you feel. Just make sure you taper first especially if you've abused it for years or even decades.

I might be sensitive to caffeine but after my first hand experience of how much I've healed after quitting I'm really starting to think that caffeine is actually toxic but it's normalized like cigarettes back in the 50s. + The industry pay for studies just to keep the lie and the machine going and everyone just drinks it because it's normal.The propaganda that is out there is actually INSANE.



Anways, i hope you all have a great week. I'll update when I've hit 1 month. Peace ü§ô

United Healthcare confirmed it was 100% covered. Everything was smooth sailing and had my bi-salp done on Dec 13th, 2024.

On Saturday Jan 25th, I received a bill in the mail from Kaleida Health (the facility) stating I owed $2277 and had 15 days to pay from the statement which was Jan 20th. Of course receiving the bill on Saturday meant I had to wait until Monday to call.

Called Kaleida on Monday to inform them that I would be contacting UHC because it was supposed to be covered and they told me they would ""freeze"" my account.

After some back and forth with UHC (through the messaging portal so I could take screenshots of the conversation to have proof) I was told that I was right (what women doesn't love hearing that haha) and I received and email from UHC on Feb 14th that the claim was ""reprocessed"" and was now ""paying 100% preventative with no member cost share to you"" and to ""please allow time for them to receive the records.""

Two weeks ago, for shits and gigs, I logged into the Kaleida Health portal and it said I owed over $11k!!! I thought to myself that maybe they had to re-do everything on their end and to not fret about it.

I woke up this morning at 5am to an email from Kaleida stating I owed over $18k now!! 

I'm off tomorrow because there ain't no way I'm going to try to reach out to them on my lunch break and waste the precious 30 mins I have to eat and then go back to work stressed/angry.

This is what I get for thinking there wouldn't be any bumps in the road involving UHC haha. Time to down some coffee and get through this day before gearing up to deal with them tomorrow.",1,1741690899.0,sterilization,3,1.0,False

**Setup Details:**

**1. Device Used for Scanning**: MacBook Pro 2021 (M1 Pro, 16GB)

**2. Mousepad as a Base**:

To create a stable base, a mousepad was placed under the scanning items. Despite the reflective surface of the coffee table not directly affecting the scanning process, the user found the mousepad to provide a more convenient and visually organized setup.

**Scanning Tips for Everyone:**

* **Markers Are Mandatory:** For both cross and parallel laser modes, using scanning markers is essential. These markers are crucial for positioning and alignment, and scanning cannot be done without them.

[Markers](https://preview.redd.it/0y7ttmhti1oe1.jpg?width=1972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6bb96d6510b15ffacc0d20920480e0543bef1d23)

* **Start Perpendicular, Then Angle the Scanner:** Begin scanning perpendicular (90¬∞) to the object‚Äôs surface to capture the most detail. After completing the 90¬∞ scan, tilt the scanner to a 45¬∞ diagonal angle to ensure all edges and features are captured.

* **Move the Scanner Itself:** To enhance coverage, physically tilt and move the scanner at different angles around the model. This technique helps improve data capture and is applicable to any 3D scanner.

* **Multi-Angle Scanning for a Perfect Mesh:** For the best mesh quality, scan the object from multiple angles. Focus on capturing areas with similar or identical geometry to make merging the scans significantly easier.",1,1741690405.0,Revopoint,0,1.0,False

But since then, we've found that we can't buy a gallon at a time. Before we can finish the jug, it will curdle. It doesn't even smell or taste bad, it just thickens and becomes an unpleasant texture.

They're both pasteurized. My guess is that a difference in the feed between the two dairies makes the milk different. My wife thinks it's a difference in storage and shipping and temperature. Any educated answers?",1,1741690218.0,NoStupidQuestions,3,1.0,False
1j8ny25,https://www.reddit.com/r/newsletterhub/comments/1j8ny25/are_ads_bad/,Are ads bad?,"Couple of weeks ago, I posted about¬†[my test ad](https://newslettercasestudies.com/first-ad)¬†for our¬†[coffee newsletter](https://letter.coffee/).

While the results are impressive and way better than what we expected, I disappointed a few Redditors.

I received comments like:

* Why would you spend money on ads?
* Focus on organic growth; why are you buying subscribers?
* Just post on social media and ask people to subscribe. Why waste money?

It got me thinking, ""Are ads bad?""

Didn't take a minute to come up with, ""I don't think so.""



For some reason, advertising is perceived as not working hard enough. I don't really buy this notion, but I understand it.

We take years to build an organic audience and if someone achieves the same results by investing money, it doesn't seem fair. I grew my email list to 2000 subscribers over two years; then I spoke to someone who acquired 26000 subscribers in two months because he could invest in ads. I get it.



With time, my thoughts as a marketer and content person have evolved.

For example, I thought shitposting on Twitter is bad and I should respect audience by posting only 'valuable' content. Now I shitpost all the time because it shows my personality and helps me stand out. It grabs eyeballs too and is important to maintain a fun:value balance.

No one likes a strict professor who is all work.



Similarly in marketing, I was against ads too. But with caffeineletter, we realised ads are the right way to grow fast and reach the right audience. Not to mention, paid marketing is not all we do.

Advertising is just a marketing channel like everything else - social media, influencer, SEO, and whatnot. It's easy to fall into the imposter trap thinking ""We don't deserve this audience because we didn't¬†*grind*¬†enough,"" but hard to acknowledge it's a result of good ad, copy, landing page, and eventually content. Our open rates and clicks remained the same even after doubling the subscribers; that tells a story.

There are 1000 ways to grow a product. Good marketers pick the ones with better ROI.

It just looks like a pile of food waste + leaves that is decomposing alright, but it's cold and the texture is not humid. I started this pile of compost in January 2024 and gradually added things (fruit peel, veggie, waste, egg shells, coffee ground, and dry leaves from my plants and trees for the dry layers) up until last fall.

I think I know what to improve this year to make it work better next time ‚Äì my question now is can I still use this pseudo-compost and incorporate it to the soil for my summer garden, even if it's not a 100% compost? I read that if it's not mature and well done it could actually release toxins in the soil?

My plan would be to plant my seeds in small pots using a purchased organic soil, and to incorporate my pseudo-compost to the soil in my field and to the soil left in my big vases from last year, and it will have around 3 months to lay there before I will transplant my plants around June.

Hi guys. I applied for a job working at a caf√© and did a trial shift last week. I ended up getting the job. Today was my second proper day on the job and although there is not a crazy amount of things to learn as it‚Äôs mainly just coffee orders, it got really busy and I forgot to put in which lanes order I took as it is a drive-through. The manager yelled out to me ‚Äú people are starting to get pissed off because you‚Äôre forgetting the lanes. Later on he put me on handing out the orders and every time he would watch me and kept saying ‚Äú keep watching your screen, you need to be on to it ‚Äú in a really aggressive way. The whole shift it felt like he had already made his mind up about me and just thought I was useless. 

Maybe I am a slow learner but by him yelling at me and making these comments, it makes me more anxious and prone to mess up.

That means it's an opportunity to visit an out-of-the-way location to watch a mostly unknown team, also known as an ""Adventure"". This particular adventure did not disappoint.

On paper, a.k.a. an online map, Incheon Seogot vs. Daejeon Korail looked like an easy 90-minute trip, walk included. With the grounds being so small, you can't blame me for being anxious and checking the Korail Instagram multiple times to make sure the fixture hadn't been moved, even on the morning of the match. Confident that it's still at the small community field, and my restaurant research done, I set off on Saturday morning with my eye on a curry lunch before the match.

[The Alley](https://preview.redd.it/n85aul5sd1oe1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=55aa120b1b834fa449a9532e5bd715b45c2cdcf3)

The area near Dohwa station is odd. You leave the station in to old district with two-story houses, and low, soulless apartment blocks. A short walk North is a giant TheSharp apartment complex, complete with it's only little mall and a pedestrian street called The Alley. Behind The shape are other brands, spanning equally large areas. As you walk towards the community field, you first follow a road with the apartment complexes on one side and the old district on the other before suddenly leaving both behind as you enter the grandiosely named Juan NATIONAL Industrial Complex. The community field is nestled within this complex.

[Dad League](https://preview.redd.it/4y5ed2htd1oe1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1d42f5315ee9a9f179e5134ef58806a72e86c70)

It really is just a community artificial grass field and track with basketball courts on either side. A simple four-step stand is off to one side, more for keeping your training gear than for actual spectators. But more importantly, there is also no sign of a Korea Cup game! There's a ""Fathers League"" game underway, but no one is getting ready to take over when they finish. Dismayed, I look at the Instagram post again, nothing has changed, it's still at this location. That can only mean...the game is on Sunday! Mother F...! How did I look at the post 20 times, and at the fixture list, and not notice this? At least I still had the beer to accompany me back to the station.

Sunday morning and I'm confident thing will be better because I know the travel time and already explored the area. This time I get a Popeyes Tanduri burger for lunch, mostly because I have no idea what it is and I like to try new foods. I quickly regret my choice because they are sooooooo sloooooow. At least I was not the delivery driver waiting for an order. They are so slow that I have to take the burger and eat it on the way to the field because I want to eat it while it's hot. The problem is that the bigger is saucy, and stuffing my face means getting sauce all over my face like a 5-year-old. I only had two napkins and needed to save at least one for when I finish eating, so most of my walk involved taking bites, then trying to get as much of the sause off my face with a finger, which I would lick to not waste any. I felt like a 5-year-old, but I enjoyed ever bite.

Along the way, I stop by a different convenience store to get a happy juice. I don't know what it's called, but it's 7% alcohol and gets me mellow but not any form of drunk. I pay and give the normal ""Gamsahamnida"" to which the owner replies: ""Hangugmal jarhaeyo!"" Why thank you my good man, that deserves another amazing ""Gamsahamnida"", but this time with a complimentary smile. Time to leave before he gets chatty!

I arrive at the field for the second day in a row, greeted by the sight of the Daejeon Korail team bus and a banner indicating the Korea Cup event. The gods be praised, I'm not a complete idiot after all.

https://preview.redd.it/ygmxuivyd1oe1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b4097d1be1d2e79854053f7318915d59d316caa

The setup was functional at best. Each team had three square weekend market tents, which seemed to serve as the dressing rooms and field side player seats. All the tents are set on the six-lane running track. Being so close to the playing surface means that the tents are blocking the view of most potential spectators, so everyone is forced to sit near one of the corner flags, and even then vision was partially blocked. I'm not the only one who chose to stand next to the field near the goal instead. On the plus side, we were near the toilets, behind which all the men go to urinate.

Daejeon has a handful of supporters. I have no idea who they were, but my guess is mostly family and friends. Who knows who all the people on the other side were. One spectator on the Daejeon side is wearing an Incheon United shirt, a United phone cover and from his bag a United scarf is peeking out. Does he know that team on the other side is the one from Incheon? If he accidently found himself at the wrong end, he seems determined to ignore it and tries his best to be happy when Daejeon scores. I figure he, like myself, is here alone, making his joy seem even more odd because he has nothing to prove to anyone. But this is all in my head and whatever the real story is, he's enjoying himself, and in my books that is a successful day of football.

[My favourite image](https://preview.redd.it/86h94yg1e1oe1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=cffb500540c2f002b5115d551ab9482d194c7b50)

The first half of the game is played on the far side of the pitch as Korail starts bullying Seogok. It's going to be a long day for the home team. I miss the first goal when I capture an image to represent the moment. It's the image of the two ball boys watching the game, and if you look carefully, you can see the white ball just about to score the goal. After the first, the goals come fast and when the half-time whistle blows I'm unsure if the score is 0-3 or 0-4.

[The field is so close](https://preview.redd.it/deg9kto6e1oe1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a896d32410b6c727cc631aa53b69ae03257808c3)

In the second half, the home team spends some time in the Korail half, thankfully most of the game is now played on our side. Seogot is still trying their best, but lapses in concentration allows Korail to pile into the box and knock the goals in. The game finishes either 0-7 or 0-8. I would later learn was 0-9, but what's one goal when you already have a baseball score?

On the way home, I stop to take a photo of a pretty coffee shop and hear someone screaming at no one in particular. The shouts are interrupted by loud spitting every few steps. I get my photo, check the map to see where I made a wrong turn, and start moving towards the station before the shouter reaches me.

Unfortunately, we are heading in the same direction and I can hear them getting closer, fast, and still talking and spitting. When they are uncomfortably close I stop to let them past, but they look sideways at me, and say ""Hello. How are you?"" And that was the last time they spoke English. They take a few more steps, putting a small distance between us, and decide they want to talk to me. I suspect the young man has a mental disability, and our conversation goes something like this, shortened, all with my limited Korean:

**Where are you going?** (*I'm going home*) **Where is that?** (*Anyang.*) **Are you going to Incheon?** (*No, Anyang*) **How will you get there?** (*Subway*) **Why don't you take a taxi?** *(It's expensive*) **How much is it**? (*I don't know, 40,000 won?*) **Wow. So you're going to Incheon station?** (*No Anyang*) **Oh, how long will it take?** (An hour) **You're not going to Incheon?** (*No, Anyang*) **Is that in the direction of Suwon?** (*Yes, that's my direction*) ... we pass someone ... **Anyeong, Anyeonghaseayo, ANYEONGHASAEYO!** ...the stranger doesn't reply... **Here's the station. Let's take the elevator.** (*I don't like elevators. I'll take the stairs*) **Why?** (*Just because*) **Let's take the elevator.** (*I want to take the stairs. Exercise*)... at the top of the stairs... **Let's use that elevator.** (*I don't like elevators*) **Oh**... and then I lose him as he gets distracted by something.

I prefer to keep to myself, but I made myself a promise that if anyone tries to talk to me on my adventures, I won't resist, and that is how I ended up walking a kilometre with a guy who could not stop asking me the same questions over and over. :)",1,1741688938.0,KLeague,1,1.0,False
1j8nn3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1j8nn3p/a_worst_meeting_with_cuck/,A worst meeting with cuck,"Am into the male escort work along with my professional background. The incident took place in 2015 when I was based out in Dehradun. I have been asked to visit a couple's place on a early sunday morning near Vasant Vihar after a good conversation of a week. I was available at the asked location and a nearly 45 years aged man approached, confirm the identity and took me at his home.

It was 9.00 am at winters morning with a lovely shiny sun, an average looking lady nearly aged 40 was taking a sunbath on the courtyard. She slowly stood up and followed us in the drawing room and sat on the sofa in front of me. We all chatted for 10 minutes they told that their 2 kids are out to visit to passing out parade ceremony of the academy. Meanwhile the man asked us to let's go to the bedroom and the lady was agreed (surprisingly she wasn't a bit shy as I found her a typical Indian housewife).

We started the act and in between he wanted me to taste her there but I avoided as I haven't found it smelling good. She was really hungry but I was a bit uncomfortable (first time) as she has a mustard oil massage on her body and smelling like a pakora. Still I did the things and she caught me tightly and wrapped around my body. Now I was really messed up with sweat and the mustard oil fusion (it was so irritating as I was not able to bear it as she was cuddling with me while her hubby was on from her back side). That half an hour after the act was really punishing me when they forced me to have a coffee. 

Immediately after the coffee he dropped me on the place where I parked my car. I just jumped into the driving seat an desperately wanted to visit a grocery store in GMS road. As soon as I found the store I quickly paid for the deodorant (fog the best one I have got in the store) and sprayed the hald of the bottle on my whole body as soon as I entered in my car. 

I can never forget the encounter of the day and never used that deo (fog) after the day which memories me that day. ",0,1741688937.0,OffMyChestIndia,2,0.29,False

# Choosing The Right Coffee Press

Using a coffee press is a fantastic way to brew rich, flavorful coffee. To get started, you need the right coffee press. This guide will help you choose the perfect one for your needs.

# Types Of Coffee Presses

There are various types of coffee presses available. Each has unique features and benefits. Here are some common types:

* **French Press:**¬†This is the most popular type. It uses a plunger and a metal or plastic mesh filter. It‚Äôs ideal for coarse ground coffee.
* **AeroPress:**¬†This type uses air pressure to push water through the coffee. It‚Äôs portable and great for travel.
* **Travel Press:**¬†Designed for portability, these presses are usually compact and durable. Perfect for making coffee on the go.
* **Electric Coffee Press:**¬†These are electric versions of the traditional press. They offer convenience and often come with temperature control.

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison table:

|Type|Best For|Portability|Ease of Use|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|French Press|Rich flavor|Moderate|Easy|
|AeroPress|Quick brew|High|Easy|
|Travel Press|On-the-go|Very High|Easy|
|Electric Coffee Press|Convenience|Low|Very Easy|

# Material Considerations

The material of your coffee press affects the taste and durability of your brew. Here are some options:

* **Glass:**¬†Glass presses are elegant and allow you to see the brewing process. They are fragile but do not affect the coffee‚Äôs taste.
* **Stainless Steel:**¬†These presses are durable and retain heat well. They are ideal for keeping your coffee hot for longer periods.
* **Plastic:**¬†Plastic presses are lightweight and less expensive. They are great for travel but can retain flavors from previous brews.
* **Ceramic:**¬†Ceramic presses are stylish and keep your coffee warm. They are fragile but do not affect the coffee‚Äôs flavor.

Consider the following factors when choosing the material:

1. **Durability:**¬†Stainless steel and plastic are more durable than glass and ceramic.
2. **Heat Retention:**¬†Stainless steel and ceramic keep your coffee hotter for longer.
3. **Taste:**¬†Glass and ceramic do not affect the taste of coffee, while plastic might.
4. **Portability:**¬†Plastic and stainless steel are better for travel due to their durability.

Choose the material that best fits your lifestyle and coffee-drinking habits.

# Selecting Coffee Beans

A coffee press, also known as a French press, is a popular way to make rich, flavorful coffee. To get the best taste, selecting the right coffee beans is crucial. The quality of your beans directly affects the taste and aroma of your coffee. In this guide, we will discuss how to choose the best beans for your coffee press.

# Freshness Matters

Freshness is key to great coffee. Fresh beans provide a more vibrant taste. Stale beans can make your coffee taste flat and bitter.

Here are some tips to ensure your beans are fresh:

* **Check the roast date:**¬†Look for beans that were roasted within the last two weeks. The fresher the roast, the better the flavor.
* **Avoid pre-ground coffee:**¬†Whole beans retain their freshness longer. Grind them just before brewing to maximize flavor.
* **Store properly:**¬†Keep your beans in an airtight container. Store them in a cool, dark place. This helps to preserve their freshness.

A helpful table to understand the shelf life of coffee beans:

|Coffee Type|Shelf Life|
|:-|:-|
|Whole Beans|1-2 weeks|
|Ground Coffee|Few days|

Remember, fresh beans make a big difference. Choose wisely and enjoy a better cup of coffee.

# Grind Size Recommendations

The grind size affects how your coffee tastes. The right grind size for a coffee press is coarse. This allows the water to extract the flavors slowly and evenly.

Here are some grind size tips:

* **Use a burr grinder:**¬†Burr grinders produce a consistent grind size. Blade grinders can be uneven.
* **Coarse grind:**¬†The grind should look like sea salt. This size prevents over-extraction and bitterness.
* **Grind just before brewing:**¬†Grinding your beans right before brewing keeps the flavors fresh.

A simple guide to grind sizes:

|Grind Size|Brewing Method|
|:-|:-|
|Coarse|French Press|
|Medium|Drip Coffee Makers|
|Fine|Espresso Machines|

The grind size is crucial. It directly impacts the extraction process. For a coffee press, aim for a coarse grind. This ensures a balanced and flavorful cup of coffee.

# Preparing Your Coffee Press

Using a coffee press can elevate your coffee experience. Preparing your coffee press is crucial for a perfect cup of coffee. This step ensures you have a clean and hot press ready to extract the best flavors from your coffee grounds. Let‚Äôs explore the steps to get your coffee press ready.

# Cleaning Before Use

Before brewing coffee, ensure your press is clean. Residue from previous brews can affect the taste. Here‚Äôs how to clean your coffee press:

* Disassemble the press: Remove the plunger and lid.
* Rinse all parts: Use warm water to rinse the beaker, plunger, and lid.
* Use mild detergent: Apply a small amount of mild dish soap to clean the parts.
* Scrub gently: Use a soft sponge or brush to scrub the beaker and plunger.
* Rinse thoroughly: Ensure all soap residue is washed off.
* Dry completely: Use a clean towel to dry all parts before reassembling.

Here‚Äôs a quick reference table:

|Step|Action|
|:-|:-|
|Disassemble|Remove plunger and lid|
|Rinse|Warm water rinse all parts|
|Detergent|Use mild dish soap|
|Scrub|Soft sponge or brush|
|Rinse|Wash off soap residue|
|Dry|Use clean towel|

Cleanliness is key. It ensures no old flavors interfere with your fresh brew. A clean press guarantees pure and flavorful coffee.

# Preheating The Press

Preheating your coffee press is essential for maintaining the brewing temperature. Here‚Äôs how to preheat your press:

1. Boil water: Heat enough water to fill your coffee press.
2. Pour hot water: Fill the beaker with boiling water.
3. Let it sit: Leave the hot water in the beaker for a few minutes.
4. Empty the beaker: Discard the water before adding coffee grounds.

Preheating keeps the brewing temperature stable. This process helps extract more flavor from the coffee grounds. A preheated press is ready to brew coffee at the ideal temperature.

Remember these key steps:

* Boil water
* Fill beaker with hot water
* Let sit for a few minutes
* Discard water

Preheating is simple but crucial. It ensures your coffee press is at the right temperature for brewing.

# Measuring Coffee And Water

Using a coffee press can turn your morning coffee into a delightful ritual. The key to a perfect brew lies in the balance of coffee and water. This guide will help you measure these ingredients accurately to ensure a rich and consistent flavor every time.

# Coffee-to-water Ratio

The coffee-to-water ratio is crucial for a well-balanced cup. A common recommendation is a 1:15 ratio, meaning one part coffee to 15 parts water. This ratio can be adjusted based on personal taste. Here are some general guidelines:

* **Mild Coffee:**¬†Use a 1:17 ratio.
* **Standard Coffee:**¬†Use a 1:15 ratio.
* **Strong Coffee:**¬†Use a 1:12 ratio.

For example, if you want to make 500 grams of coffee:

|Strength|Coffee (grams)|Water (grams)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Mild|29|500|
|Standard|33|500|
|Strong|42|500|

Adjusting the ratio allows you to customize the strength of your coffee. It‚Äôs all about finding what suits your palate. Keep experimenting until you discover your perfect mix.

# Using A Scale

Using a scale ensures you get the exact amount of coffee and water each time. This consistency leads to a better-tasting cup of coffee. Here‚Äôs how you can use a scale effectively:

1. **Place the empty coffee press on the scale.**¬†Tare the scale to zero.
2. **Add the ground coffee.**¬†Measure the amount based on your preferred ratio.
3. **Remove the press from the scale.**¬†Heat your water separately.
4. **Place the press back on the scale.**¬†Tare the scale again.
5. **Slowly pour hot water over the coffee grounds.**¬†Pour until you reach the desired weight.

This method ensures accuracy and repeatability. It might seem tedious at first, but it becomes second nature with practice. Using a scale also helps you avoid using too much coffee or water, which can lead to waste.

By following these steps, you can enjoy a perfectly brewed cup of coffee. All it takes is a little precision and patience.

I just wanted to post and say thank you for this community with the fair criticisms, bluntness and the motivation which has been given by the community for me and my own health and well being. When I started this diet I was got myself into an ED unintentionally and wanted to change my diet before my health and own wellbeing got worse and since I found this community I feel so much better. It's only been 7 days and now I feel as good as I did when I started my weight loss and overall better health journey. 

I adapted eating a nutritious breakfast of just eggs and meat with a black coffee and ate until I felt full and have for the past 7 days and feel so energized, motivated and overall healthier. Yes, I have an occasional zero coke and or I will chew gum throughout the day but even then I track my calories because it's my way of analysing data and how it corresponds with my weight and I found that increasing my calories by over half plus walking 10k each day still allows me to lose weight but even then if I wasn't and maintaining the weight, I still feel so much better, physically and mentally. 

But all that said, I just wanted to post and appreciate this community for teaching me a lot of things and right now I just feel content and happy! Which is so contradicting from when I started this diet and this journey of bettering myself. I wish everyone peace and luck on their personal health goals and journeys, and sorry for this sounding so sappy but I wanted to tell someone or an altitude of people, even if they are complete strangers who have a few things in common :)

1j8nlk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/1200isplenty/comments/1j8nlk9/a_300_calorie_breakfast/,A ‚âà300 calorie breakfast,"This breakfast keeps me full for hours and helped me lose 20 pounds in 2 months. I usually have it on low-carb days with 2 slices of whole wheat sugar free toast. But, since I'm carb cycling, no toast for breakfast today. I make a three-egg omelet using just one spritz of olive oil, and I season it with salt, pepper, paprika, and onion powder. I usually pair my omelet with veggies like cucumbers, tomatoes (which I sometimes sprinkle with salt, pepper, and dry mint), bell peppers, and lettuce. I also have a cup of coffee with skimmed milk and no sugar.  I also sometimes have 1 medjool date after my breakfast as a sweet treat (I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but this is just enough to satisfy any cravings).

On top of this, I work out four to five times a week, alternating between strength training and cardio. Thankfully, I‚Äôm now at a healthy weight, but I plan to lose 6 more pounds to reach my goal.

I though I'd share this breakfast because I **truly** believe that the first meal of the day sets the tone for everything that follows from energy levels to cravings.

That being said, I've been having this breakfast nearly every morning for the past two months, so I‚Äôm thinking it's time to switch things up a bit... Would love to hear what you guys eat on your low-carb days! üòä

1j8njqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1j8njqt/a_creepy_incident_that_happened_to_me_while_doing/,A creepy incident that happened to me while doing internship in a small town in France,"This story happened last year when I was 18 years old and doing a 3-week internship in a small, rural French town called Still, which is near Strasbourg in the Bas-Rhin department, northeastern France. During the internship, I met a man named Richard. He looked to be in his 50s or 60s and was noticeably shorter than me in height.

At first, Richard was kind to me, and I respected him. We would exchange pleasantries whenever we crossed paths. Everything seemed normal, and I genuinely thought he was just a friendly older man. But sadly, that didn‚Äôt last long.

It all started one evening after he saw me visiting one of my co-worker‚Äôs rooms at the hostel where we were staying. He offered to show me his room, and not wanting to seem rude, I agreed. I thought nothing of it at the time.

When I entered his room, I noticed something unusual: another small, nicely decorated room inside. It seemed like a cozy space, and I felt a strange sense of unease. I tried to strike up a conversation, but before I could say much, Richard‚Äôs behavior took a sudden, disturbing turn.

Without warning, he started masturbating.

I froze. My mind went blank. I thought I was going crazy, like I was hallucinating. I couldn‚Äôt understand what was happening. All I could do was look away, trying to ignore the situation as best as I could. My heart raced, and I could feel a cold sweat forming on my back.

But that wasn‚Äôt the worst of it. Richard reached out, and without any hesitation, touched my hand. The chill of his fingers against mine sent a shockwave of panic through my body. My thoughts spun. I realized he had the keys to the room. I could be trapped here.

In that moment, I knew I had to leave. My body moved before my mind could catch up. I stumbled toward the door, my legs shaking beneath me, desperately trying to think of an excuse to get out. But as I reached for the door handle, I felt him following me. His presence was suffocating.

I opened the door, heart pounding in my chest, and fled his room, barely able to breathe. Richard followed me into the hallway, but I forced a smile, trying to maintain some semblance of control. ‚ÄúThanks for showing me your room,‚Äù I muttered, my voice shaky, barely able to hide the disgust I felt.

He didn‚Äôt react, not in the way I expected. He remained unnervingly calm, as if nothing had happened.

I went back to my room, but I couldn‚Äôt shake what had just occurred. I was in complete shock. My mind couldn‚Äôt process the events fast enough. I stood there, frozen, for what felt like an eternity, my thoughts racing but unable to make sense of it.

After a long pause, I finally managed to get myself together. I drank two cups of coffee, hoping it would numb my thoughts, but the images of that moment refused to leave.

Later, I told my teacher about what happened, after the internship had ended. They were incredibly supportive and even apologized to me, though it wasn‚Äôt their fault. They understood how serious the situation was and took immediate action. They sent me to a therapist, and after processing everything with the therapist, I was left with two choices:

1. Report Richard to the police.


2. Tell the administration of the place where I was staying about what happened.



I chose the latter. As much as what Richard did disturbed me, I didn‚Äôt want to completely destroy his life by reporting him. I hoped that by involving the administration, they could help him get the support he needed.

The administration took my report very seriously. They sent Richard to places where he could get the help he required, ensuring that something like this wouldn‚Äôt happen again.

Though the experience was traumatic, I felt a sense of peace after everything was handled. I knew I had made the right choice, and I could move forward knowing I‚Äôd taken action in a way that was thoughtful and responsible.",3,1741688538.0,LetsReadOfficial,0,1.0,False
