Ello ello! My name is Lewis, I'm 30 and from the UK, more specifically the North West.

I'm on the search for someone like minded and just ""gets it"". I'm searching for that connection, that something which just makes you want to fall into things deeper.

I'm interested in getting to know each other on a deeper level, go on dates, have fun and just enjoy life! At this point where I am in my life, I just want to be happy with the person I choose to spend the rest of my life with.

I know what I want from a relationship and I'm not afraid to show it. Someone to be by each others sides through thick and thin, the good and the bad. Who understands you've got to weather the stormy seas to enjoy the good in life.

I work a crazy schedule so I'm available all hours of the day throughout the week.

I value trust and honesty above all else in a relationship. If I can't trust you, what's the point? I'd much rather be hurt than your brutal honesty than your lies and attempts to soften the blow. With that said, I'm not interested in wasting yours or my time. So I'll get it out of the way now that I have a 4 year old child from a previous relationship.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it

I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

A little about me:

5""10, 75KG, slim/athletic build, blue eyes, medium length brown hair/beard.

Selfie time so you can see my in the flesh: https://imgur.com/a/Z17J0qs

When I leave the house I enjoy exploring, hiking, cycling, swimming, trying new experiences, being in nature and going to gigs/festivals.

Some of the stuff I enjoy:

- Hiking/cycling - I love being outdoors
- Listening to heavy metal/rock
- Computer programming (self taught, wanting to turn it into a career. Making my own android game)
- Watching documentaries/anime (give me your best, I need some new shit to watch)
- Playing games (PC gamer at heart. Played a lot of OSRS, Minecraft, Rust to name a few).
- Board games (Terraforming Mars, Scythe, D&D, Gloomhaven etc)

I'm also 420 friendly and enjoy partaking in the devils lettuce.

This year I'm looking to start the gym full time, go rock climbing/bouldering, learn to play the drums and finally get my driving licence!

I'm also in the process of completely redecorating my house from top to bottom. No car but I do have a house.

What I'm looking for in you:

24-34 (not opposed to younger/older but looking for around my age). You don't have to be the same continent/time zone. I'm open to LDR but it has to be with intention. Similar interests and hobbies.

More importantly, you're interested and ready to put in the effort to get to know each other with the intention of things progressing to something serious.

If you're interested in chatting, pop me a quick message and we'll see how things go :).",1,1735474161.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

- I've been working on/off now for a while on an android game. I leave it for a few months then forget where I'm up to and start again.

I'm 17M, my two younger siblings are 13M & 5F. My sister is autistic (still awaiting assessment, but she hss all of the signs) and my brother has diagnosed ADHD, probable ASD, and ""anger issues"" that in my opinion are just meltdowns.

I'm struggling. My sister does nothing but scream. She enjoys seeing us upset. I know that isn't really whats happening but its what it seems like. She follows us around, screaming and giggling about it. She loves seeing people hurt and crying. My brother is really badly effected so he's her favorite victim. She enjoys backing him into corners and screaming until he's sobbing and wets himself.

I'm managing to the best of my ability but I can't watch him 24/7, even though I try. 

He has lashed out at her physically twice. The first time I made a post about it ( https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/t6xjqWAim2 ). Not sure if you can see as it was removed, but thought I'd link anyway.

Since then she's started screaming again and my brother has gotten a lot worse (another post for more context - https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/1AzK9WMYNz ).

In short, the first time he was backed into a corner by her while I was trying to deal with the dog. He's attacked my sister before so I needed to get him outside. He ended up shoving her away and she stumbled and his her head on the coffee table. She was fine, not even a bump, but they took her to the ER anyway.

The second time was a few days ago. I made the mistake of trying to shower (they were both asleep) but I guess the shower woke my sister up. She started her usual annoying routine and my brother attempted to physically remove her from the room. She pushed against the door & he slammed it, trapping her fingers. No injuries, just bruising, but obviously there was a lot of sobbing on both ends.

My brother frequently talks about wanting to die. Daily. Every time she starts. My sister is awful to be around but is obviously suffering a great deal too, and the longer this continues the more worried I am. My brother is one thing, but the dog could kill her in two seconds flat. Parent's refuse to rehome or give him to my dad.

I've told my therapist, my brother has told his anger management guy (I wouldn't even call him a therapist atp), I've told teachers. My dad has reported what I've told him to CPS I know. But nothing has happened. 

I am ready to finally make my own report, with photos and videos if needed. I just need to know what will make them listen and how I can keep my brother with me. My dad is willing to take us both (and the dog) in. Although at this point I think they'd just put our dog down.

If we're going to be separated I don't know if I'll report it. He's fragile and I don't think he'd cope. He doesn't trust anyone except me at the moment. Is there anything I can do to make sure that doesn't happen? 

Sorry if anything is missing or confusing. She doesn't let us sleep and I'm exhausted.

If there's anywhere else I could crosspost this for more advice (unrelated to CPS, even just to help them both) I'd appreciate the redirection too.",1,1735474096.0,Fostercare,0,1.0,False

Hello, I'm not sure what's happening to me and I could really use some help.

Friday 3am I woke up with nausea and UTI symptoms. The UTI pain was the most extreme I've ever experienced so saw an out of hours GP at 5am where I was prescribed the usual trimethoprim. For the rest of the day I felt extremely drained likely from lack of sleep.

Saturday 11am I woke up after 12 hours of sleep feeling good. I had a bowl of cereal and a coffee, and then about an hour later I started experiencing all the symptoms above, minus the panic attack. 

Saturday 3pm after 3 hours of sitting on the bathroom floor I phoned 111 (UK non-emergency healthcare) who advised I attend A&E. Partner took me there, but all my vitals came back normal including blood oxygen 100%. Out of hours GP appointment scheduled for the evening. I struggled to walk back to the car because of my breathing and legs feeling like jelly.

Saturday 9pm I had the GP appointment where again my vitals were fine and they said it was probably anxiety but also that I needed to insist my regular GP do my thyroid function test ASAP (see below). At that time I was feeling anxious, but I wasn't feeling anxious earlier in the day.

When I got home, I had a full blown panic attack. I don't have them often. I managed to get some sleep, waking up in the night very often with a pounding chest and anxiety, but I slept. The first few minutes after I woke up I felt actually good and normal, but then the chest feeling kicked in again and is still present as I type.

I've never had anxiety or panic attacks lasting 24 hours before, especially not after sleeping. Is this really what is happening to me or could there be an actual medical cause?

Other things maybe of note:
- I had a case of BPPV last weekend and at the doctors on Monday my blood pressure was low for the first time in my life. 90 over something, sorry can't remember exactly.
- My annual thyroid function test is 3 months overdue because my GP surgery is facing a backlog. My dose hasn't changed in years though.
- About 1-2 times a month I'll wake up in the night feeling really nauseous and often throw up. When I do, I'm not able to get back to sleep because my body jerks me awake. This has been going on for about 6 months.

My dad has been pulling very long shots with espresso equipment for years now, with a ratio of probably 1:10 or even higher. I’m guessing he’s doing about 10g in, 100g out, in about 30s.

He doesn’t like the “café serré”, French for strong small coffees a.k.a. “espresso” 😅.

I would describe it as a kind of Americano, but without adding the water separately afterwards. It’s definitely not a bad cup of coffee, on the contrary.

But I’ve been wondering for a while now if this is a common thing to do, or if this style has a name, or what the specific guidelines would be to get the best possible result. Does it make sense to try and hit that 25-30s second range, in this case? Does the theory extrapolate to longer shots, in the sense that you’d probably make the grind size coarser, when running this much water through the puck, and therefore still end up with proper extraction?

She was so intentional about “getting to know me better” (her exact words, by the way). And yes, I blushed when she said that!

1hougf6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hougf6,Barista Express Steam Wand Lever upgrade,"I’ve had my machine for just under 2 months and I’ve definitely gone down a rabbit hole of buying accessories and changing things including a bottomless portafilter, better spring gauge tamper than the tamper included, WDT tools, new IMS baskets and IMS shower screen to name a few (don’t tell the other half 🤫)

But one of the best upgrades was changing the switch for the steam wand to this lever. It only requires removing 5 screws and cost about £10 and was well worth it, makes a night and day difference. It’s a shame Breville/Sage don’t design it like this out the box because the OEM switch is stiff and not nice to use, especially if your machine is next to a wall. 

I cannot recommend this enough. If you’re looking in the US, Crema Coffee Products has the best one (will be getting their wheels next). There is a store in the Netherlands that sells and ships to all of EU (not U.K., damn Brex**)

1houfbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Victron/comments/1houfbu/totally_new_person_has_questions/,Totally new person has questions,"Hi,

I have no practical knowledge at all and hope you can guide me towards some resources (or maybe provide easy answers).

I'm trying to figure out a setup for an inland house boat and would like to understand how it all works but without learning about all of the electrics from scratch (not sure how realistic that is). 

I will pay someone competent and certified to actually mount things because frankly I don't expect to know enough by then.

This is going to be a residential boat that will move about once per week.

I'm designing a semi-ideal system for a boat I don't own yet. I'm trying to understand how much things will cost so that I can start slowly upgrading them when I see what system is in place already.

My hope is to plan things out so that I can for eg. add solar panels as time goes on without having to buy a new solar controller or something.

Current ""Plan""

1. Start with simplistic battery setup, eg. 4x GoKWh LiFePO4 12V 320Ah, they come with BMS and can become one 16384Wh pack. It appears that charging  will be ""easy""? Please correct me here, based on info on their website it sounds very very simple. The boat will be 12V and I would stay at that.
   1. I expect the boat will have 2 old led acid batteries when we buy it.
2. I don't know how powerful the engine will be but I know there are various options regarding appropriate alternators. At minimum we will have 35hp at max probably 50hp. I'm currently ignoring this part a bit.
3. We will 100% need Galvanic Isolator for the potential shore power. VDI-32 seems appropriate. 
4. I would like 5000VA Inverter, there appears to be no downside other than size/price? I would love to be able to run a coffee machine or maybe an electric kettle sometimes without tripping the whole boat.
5. Victron Cerbo GX does management and visibility, Sounds amazing.
6. Solar MPPT of some kind
7. Slowly built up set of panels

From that I would need some AC/DC converts maybe? Some more charging infrastructure?   
Some massive amount of appropriate cables, fuse boxes, switches and a busbar?

  
But then I see people referencing devices like Victron MultiPlus-II 12/5000/220-50 230V (4000W)

That appears to integrate almost everything I need into 1 device? It appears I would just need MPPT and Cerbo/BT dongle? Galvanic Insulator can wait a bit.

I would love the ""simplicity"" of a single device if it costs a bit more. But I can't evaluate what exactly I need. I could also see how it would be a better ideal to have more cheaper devices in case something breaks and has to be replaced.

Quick note about budget, buying a boat will eat most of our savings but will also free us to pay a loan with the rent money. We won't be able to drop £5k right away on just electrics but can do that over a few months if needed. So we will probably stick with the old inverter for a few months while upgrading batteries.

  
Please feel free to ask any questions. As I mentioned this is an absolutely new subject to me so it's possible I'm confused about something you find obvious.",1,1735472729.0,Victron,0,1.0,False
1houetj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Retatrutide/comments/1houetj/gut_healthy_diet_course/,Gut Healthy Diet Course,"Hey all, saw some posts on here about people having stomach/gut issues and just thought I’d share the diet tips that resolved my issues in the past.

I suffered from GERD/acid reflux daily, was taking antacids 2-3 times a day and the heartburn was keeping me up at night. This plan is designed to reduce as many stressors on the gut as possible, even if this only helps one person it will be worth it.

First remove (or try to reduce) any triggers that cause issues, basically anything with good flavour is gone:

* Chocolate
* Mint
* Chilli
* Garlic
* Onion
* Tomato
* Pepper
* Anything deep fried
* Coffee/Caffeine/Stimulants
* Alcohol
* Soft drinks
* Dairy (lactose free is fine)

So for flavour on food you will be looking at herbs and some mild spices like sweet paprika. I can’t stress how good Turmeric powder is, really notice I almost never get sick when I include this in my diet.

Only two supplements are recommended. Start the day with a (30ml) shot of Apple Cider Vinegar (mixed in half a cup of water to soften the blow). And add 3g glutamine to each meal.

In terms of meals, split them into smaller more regular meals if your life can support it. Ideally 5-6. Reduce fibre, you don’t need large amounts (https://youtu.be/DEx9foeADnc) and it slows down digestion making it harder on your gut. If you’re on Reta your stomach emptying is already slowed down and I’m thinking this is why some people are experiencing gut issues when combined with high fibre diet or using fibre supplements.

Took about 6 months to fix my issues but within 1 month I was reducing how many antacids I took and by month 6 they weren’t needed at all. I can go back to using any of the triggers mentioned above (in moderation). Most importantly I can eat pizza and pasta again.",1,1735472675.0,Retatrutide,0,1.0,False

1houdp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicfamilies/comments/1houdp6/aita_for_feeling_hurt_and_disrespected_by_my_mom/,AITA for Feeling Hurt and Disrespected by My Mom and Sister?,"Hi Reddit, I really need some perspective on my situation because it’s been weighing on me, especially with the holidays and New Year’s Eve coming up.

To start, I recently graduated from university—a moment I was really proud of and excited to celebrate with my family. But instead of being there for me, my sister didn’t attend my graduation. The reason? A friend of hers was visiting from out of town. She prioritized hanging out with this friend over celebrating a major milestone in my life. To make matters worse, she took our shared car during this time, knowing full well I’d need it in the coming days. And it wasn’t for anything urgent—she just went to another city to grab coffee with her friend.

This kind of behavior isn’t new, but it really hurt me this time. It feels like I’m constantly being disregarded and taken for granted. My sister doesn’t contribute much at home; she doesn’t do chores or help out in any meaningful way. On the other hand, I do my fair share of chores and even help her with her university tasks whenever she needs it. Despite this, she shows no gratitude or remorse for her actions.

What really stings is how my mom handles these situations. Instead of supporting me or calling out my sister’s behavior, she always takes her side. It doesn’t matter what my sister does—she gets a free pass every time. If I bring up how I feel disrespected or point out the unfairness, I’m immediately labeled as “jealous.”

Jealous? Of what? I have no reason to envy her. This isn’t about jealousy—it’s about respect. My sister’s actions (and my mom’s enabling) make me feel like I don’t matter to them. It’s not just the graduation; it’s a pattern of behavior. Even on Christmas, instead of making it a happy and meaningful day, they both treated me poorly. Now, as New Year’s Eve approaches, I feel the same cycle repeating itself.

Every time I try to express how hurt I feel, they dismiss me, turn the blame on me, or accuse me of being “too sensitive.” It’s exhausting. I feel like I’m the only one trying to maintain some level of respect and consideration in this family, but instead, I’m treated like the bad guy.

Am I overreacting or being unreasonable? Or is it fair for me to feel this hurt and frustrated? AITA?",1,1735472541.0,toxicfamilies,0,1.0,False

I am a very stable person now, having also quit alcohol, and an aura of peace, gratitude and serenity reigns in how I handle whatever comes to me.

Here are some of the gifts that I received from Ayahuasca, that I really felt deeply in the core of my being:

""As long as I do my best, there is nothing to worry about""

""There is nothing to fear, I am an infinite being of Light""

""There are infinite possibilities as to what you can do, what you can become. You decide.""

- avoided coffee because I was afraid it would make the poop too intense and force it

- used a potty stool (a must especially if you're short I think)

The medical staff said don't force it and just let it slide gently out. It wasn't the most pleasant experience in the world and my stitches are deff stinging a bit. But I did it! Yay! I'm no longer worried about dying from not being able to poop until my stitches were fully healed.

We had huge crushes on each other and for a short while told each other we loved one another. I think I felt overwhelmed by the love bombing he unintentionally did and it made me back away. At the same time, an ex had been asking me for another chance. I took the ex back, and broke it up with the crush friend. I thought I would be missing a huge chance at happiness if I didn't. Boy that turned out to be a shit decision. 

After years of dating other people, and a long term relationship I think is ending soon, it's been almost 11 years since we met. Old flame has been dating someone for two years which I've quietly supported. I knew that I couldn't talk to him regularly over these 11 years because I fall back in love easily and I would develop feelings again. 

On Christmas, he sent me his engagement photos in the early afternoon. I was rushing around helping my mother, my boyfriend who I've been on the rocks with is stuck to his phone in a chair. I check my messages and feel like the bottom of my heart drops out. A Merry Christmas message, and a happy couple smiling at each other. I want to throw up. I can't respond. 

I'm happy for him, I keep telling myself. But all of a sudden I just don't feel real. I've never felt like this when I find out an ex is getting married or in a committed relationship. Being disappointed is an understatement. I feel crushed. 

Here's the part that lets me know I'm a bad person though. I've been obviously having relationship problems, which has caused me to re-evaluate my past relationships. I started dreaming about the day when I could see old flame again, what I might say if we were single at the same time, etc. I would never try to break up his relationship, but damn I really hoped they'd break up. I had plans on what I'd say, my apology for being a stupid teenager, and tons more. I know some of this was started from my loneliness in my current situation, but I really do respect and miss old flame. I feel so delusional, like how could I ever think that would work when we were both taken, and he was so happy? 

There's still a fucked up part of me that believes they'll break up, and after some healing, I could ask him to talk over coffee, and ask if he'd see us ever dating again. I just can't imagine living the rest of my life never seeing him again. I feel like I need to know if we could have been something more. 

It's unfair because I couldn't promise him we'd fall in love again. I couldn't promise this was going to be a marriage, but god I just wanted another chance, even if I didn't deserve it. 

I blocked him on social media after leaving him a vague but hinted message. I clarified I was in therapy and that I'd work on my own problems, and that he did nothing wrong but that I'd need to block him. I didn't read what he said, I was too scared. I still have his number, him mine, but I can't look at his pictures and keep feeding into the fantasy. I'm so sorry, friend. I really missed the boat. I'll have to get over it. 

How can I start to let this go?


TLDR: I'm an idiot and only realized how much I wanted to spend time with someone until I couldn't. They got engaged and I feel crushed. I won't interfere, but god I wish it would make a difference. ",1,1735471663.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

But the next morning i woke up in a rage and felt violated, i wish I could have punched her or pushed her away and said ""stop touching me"". She seemed to get some sort of sick satisfaction to my being uncomfortable, and then it hit me: this triggered me so much because its how I feel around my mother, all the time. I read the book about emotional incest/covert incest and it was exactly how it felt. I live with my father who is ""separated"" from my mother but is still under her control so to speak. For example, they are getting a divorce but he still lets her say things to him like ""I'll call you back after i finish unwrapping all the presents you bought me"", sarcastically.

He thinks that my healthy eating mindset is stupid and I can ""get calories from anywhere"", and more things alone this line. He says ""you (and your mother) do everything backwards"" and that I am crazy and make everything up in my head. But then his otherside is loving and caring and he denies to think like this. I think its his shadow, he is unconscious of it. Like one day he praises my intellect then the next makes fun of me for always reading books.

I have had dreams of my mother attacking me, or yelling at me, and they are always upon waking. I figure that is why i always wake up angry, and i hide or numb my feelings all day until the reawaken, literally, the next morning.

I cant take it anymore I don't know what to do. I feel blocked at every escape, like a prisoner chained to a wall. If I finally muster some strength to move, the guards beat me. If i try and escape, I am caught, and the guards beat me. No matter what I do, the guards beat me, and i end up more broken than before. Every-time i have an idea to do something for myself its almost as if my parents want to stop me and do everything they can that I fail and remain around them to be their scapegoat.

To make it short, I met a guy on this dating app called Coffee Meets Bagel, we talked for almost 2 months, during which we never met coz I was on frequent business trips and he claimed he was on a long business trip too.

Everything was quite smooth and fine, until he started to strongly encourage me to start an online shop on the platform called ESMEO.  

I declined the idea at first which brought us into a fight, and when I finally agreed to do so to avoid further fights, I googled this platform and got nothing except only one post on Reddit.

I got suspicious and refused to further process my application of setting up the online shop, and called the local anti-scam hotline which immediately verified that this is a romance scam:)

Following the advice of the anti-scam officer, I blocked him on all social platforms, and I haven’t heard from him again so far.

The key points I want to share are,

1. ESMEO drop shopping platform
The names could vary but the rules behind remain unchanged- open shop> list products> get orders> pay deposit first> products shipped> get your deposit and profit.
My scammer told me he’s been using this platform for years however the business entity was just changed into the current name 2months ago. And the website is super fake if you try chatting with the CS, their English makes no sense.

2. Meet your dates ASAP
If your matches refuse to meet up/ FaceTime, block them immediately, don’t buy any excuses and don’t built any relationships with them before you meet.

3. Stick to your bottom line
Don’t let any sweet talks manipulate you and make you do something you are not comfortable with. If you are not OK with it, turn it down.

4. Go to families/ friends/ police for help
Scammers might harass or even blackmail you, don’t give in or be terrified, go to your trusted ones for advice or help or protection.

I’ve noticed some of you have been selling PDFs of the [Remarkably Organized](https://github.com/brianschwabauer/remarkably-organized) open-source planner here. While it’s awesome to see people adding their own touches and enhancements, I think it’s unnecessary to pay for the original version that’s already freely available.

**Here’s the scoop:**

* **Reselling the Original:**

Some folks are just taking the planner as-is and selling it. Since the creator, Brian Schwabauer, has shared it for free on [GitHub](https://github.com/brianschwabauer/remarkably-organized), buying these unmodified versions doesn’t really support him or the community.

* **Adding Enhancements:**

On the flip side, if someone adds their own designs, structures, or extra content, that’s a different story. These enhanced versions involve extra effort and creativity, and supporting them can be worthwhile if you appreciate the added value.

If you want to support Brian directly, you can [buy him a coffee here](https://buymeacoffee.com/brianschwabauer) ☕️. Plus, you can build and customize your own planner for free using the tools available on [this page](https://remarkably-organized.pages.dev/).

Huge shout-out to Brian for all his hard work on this project! Let’s keep supporting the original creators and the open-source community.

Secondly, quality may differ from one outlet to another and I’m talking about their outlets which also have McCafe.

So, my experience over the past two years has been as such that I feel like the overall quality and taste of the food has improved.

They are also bringing changes to their menu and while I liked their older chicken wrap better, their new crispy chicken burger is good and I like 95% of the stuff I’ve tried from their McCafe menu.

I honestly feel like their McCafe coffee is better than bluetokai. And their fries have always been addicting, so there’s no competition there.

I believe the integration of McCafe and their attempt to give a more premium experience through it has also forced them to improve their regular stuff.

We chatted back & forth maybe 5min & then he told me his whole name & then before I could reply with my name he just I'm assuming, sighed off or got busy...it's been two days Of just silence,ok cool...we get busy, we are adults, i totally get it,but then I had posted on my story & noticed he's been viewing my stuff. Ok, cool so your online, but not actively reading your messages..mkay..day 3 still no reply,I'm busy anyways I didn't really get a chance to look at my phone at all while at work,shared a funny clip or two on my story again while at lunch & back to work..end of the day again same thing he's viewing my stuff, hasn't replied..still fine.so now I'm just confused like I thought he said he wanted to ""get to know me& take me out"" don't guys communicate anymore?? Or are we expected to chase men now?  Or is this now a normal ,just waiting around...It was actually a turn off.i brushed it off & just went about my night && said well maybe he didn't like me, maybe he just changed his mind..which is cool too, I'm just confused. I did want message him to gain clarity ,but he hasn't even opened my last message lmfao so I was like it feels like a waste of breathe & time on my part for someone who's talked the talk,but no action...what's protocol here for someone like this??

1hotqqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1hotqqk/needing_connection_vs_wanting_connection/,Needing connection vs wanting connection,"I was diagnosed a couple of years ago when I was 34 - high masking.   
  
I seem to get very depressed if I spend too long by myself, or without meaningful human connection.   
  
I'm not sure why or where it comes from, whether it's a feeling of FOMO or self-criticism that's taken over me, or just a normal psychological need. Strangely, if I go to a place with other people, for example a library or coffee shop, and sit with others without interacting, it seems to make me feel better.  
  
It feels like there's a gap between what I need and what I want - socially. It's not immediately obvious at the surface level that I \*want\* human connection - it's been safer to stay away from people. But it seems to be what I need - the depression is alleviated when I have meaningful human connection. 

When this loneliness depression hits, it's really hard to do anything - even to go out and connect with people. 

Does anyone have the same experience, or have any advice on how to deal with this kind of loneliness depression? I'm interested in spirituality and meditation, and meditations like loving-kindness are useful, I've yet to find a technique that's good for this kind of depression.

A Third Wave Experience,"Coffee is BAD. Let's settle it for once and all. Is it so difficult making good coffee. And no flavored coffee is not Coffee.  
One of the main reasons we keep visiting certain coffee spots is their late-night availability—it’s a big draw for night owls like us. But does staying open late justify a compromise on basic services and customer experience?

During a recent visit to the Punjabi Bagh outlet, their app wasn’t responding, and when we asked the barista for help with the Wi-Fi, we were told it was too slow to be of any use. Baristas often seem rude, kitchenware feels disorganized, and there are recurring complaints about the RO system. To top it off, the ladies’ washroom was out of order, and the men’s washroom was in a dirty, unpleasant state.

While we appreciate that the backend team has patiently listened to our feedback, it’s disheartening that no significant improvements have been made, even after multiple visits.

What’s your take on this? Do late-night cafés get a free pass for poor service just because they’re open late?",0,1735469647.0,IndiaCoffee,1,0.5,False

This is my first time travelling solo, took the decision after a long term relationship ended couple of months back. The purpose of this trip was to get away from home for Christmas and New Years, and to process my breakup and clear my head. I’ve been allowing myself to feel whatever I’m feeling without judging it, and just letting it pass. 

But the last 2 days have been hard. I think the loneliness is getting to me. 8 days was probably too much for a first time solo traveller but like I said, the main idea was to get away for those 2 big days. I did a group activity today, and went to Chamcha Market and Baan Kang Wat yesterday. Wherever I go, I only see couples and families. Maybe even groups of friends. I was hoping to make some friends, but decided to stay in a hotel because I like my space. A lot of people said I would end up making friends while out and about, or on group activities. I’m not just holed up in my hotel. I’m out everyday, and feel like I’ve barely spoken to anyone. 
I have 3 more days to go. For the sake of my sanity, I’d really like to meet some people lol. Not interested in partying, but maybe just grabbing a drink, coffee, someone down to explore the city together. Does anyone know of any meet-ups?

It helped me understand a lot about relationships. The idea is that everyone has a special way they like to give and receive love.

There are 5 main love languages:
Words of affirmation: Saying things like “I love you” or “I’m proud of you.” Kind words make a big difference.

Quality time: Spending time together, focusing on each other without distractions.

Gifts: It doesn’t have to be expensive—small things like a flower or chocolate can mean a lot.

Acts of service: Doing something to help, like cooking a meal or fixing something.

Physical touch: Hugs, holding hands, or even a pat on the back.

For me, I think my love language is acts of service. I feel most loved when someone helps me out with something, like making me coffee or taking care of things when I’m overwhelmed.

What’s your love language? Do you feel more loved when someone shows love in your language?",4,1735469274.0,EgySexEducation,10,0.84,False
1hotlb4,https://i.redd.it/vgrm7zuuor9e1.jpeg,Tom Ford - Tobacco Vanille,"**A Brief History**

In 2004, after leaving YSL, Tom Ford began laying the foundation for his own brand, driven by his unique vision of luxury. By 2005, he founded Tom Ford SA, marking a new chapter in fashion and beauty. In 2006, he introduced his first perfume, *Tom Ford Black Orchid* under Tom Ford Beauty, a fragrance that quickly became a cult classic and remains iconic.

Ford's ambitions went beyond a single fragrance. By late 2005, he assembled a dream team, including Olivier Gillotin, Richard Herpin, Christophe Laudamiel, Jacques Cavallier Belletrud, and Olivier Cresp to name a few, with the sole task of creating a luxury perfume line. This vision came to life in 2007 with the launch of the Private Blend collection. Among these were legendary creations like Tobacco Vanille, Amber Absolute, Noir de Noir, Velvet Gardenia, Black Violet, Oud Wood, Purple Patchouli, Bois Rouge, Moss Breches, Tuscan Leather, Neroli Portofino, and Japan Noir.

This debut collection established Ford as a key player in the fragrance industry, laying the foundation for his lasting legacy.



All Tom Ford Private Blend perfumes share a signature design for their boxes and bottles. Tobacco Vanille comes in a rich brown box with golden stickers and text. The bottle itself sports a matching golden sticker that, to my surprise, has held up better than the stickers on my other bottles, which often seem to disintegrate with time. It seems the brand deliberately opts for the cheapest materials imaginable for these labels. Their sticker game is as strong (or weak) as Chanel's.

The bottle, while elegant, accumulates scratches with the ease of a seasoned traveller collecting souvenirs, lending it a weathered charm (or annoyance, depending on how you see it). The cap is topped with a golden plate and is starting to get loose with time. On a more positive note, the atomizer delivers a satisfying spray with each use.

Overall, the presentation is decent, but with escalating prices, one can’t help but expect greater durability and attention to detail.



Once again, *Fragrantica* is your go-to resource for understanding what you’re smelling, because this fragrance is so well blended that it becomes quite challenging to decipher individual notes as they blend so seamlessly like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle.

**Here's what I get.**

The perfume opens with very rich and warm dry tobacco leaves mixed with warm spices, imagine the scent of a freshly roasted and blended spice in a grinder, with cinnamon, nutmeg and traces of cloves. The lack of heavy-handed cloves is the immediate difference you feel when compared to the clones.

Normally, dry tobacco leaves carry a distinct earthy dustiness like the scent of an old bookshop. But here, it’s surprising how that dusty quality is absent, replaced by a smoother, almost resinous warmth that feels unexpectedly clean yet grounded.

As the fragrance develops, the spices gradually subside, and the tobacco becomes more dense blending with a beautiful, semi-sweet gourmand vanilla that evokes memories of comforting desserts.

Now, to keep that sweetness in check, there’s the presence of a mild, slightly bitter note, probably from cacao. The bitterness provides the perfect counterpoint that never lets this run away in the diabetic sweet category.

In the late dry down, after several hours, the tobacco and vanilla calm down, to reveal a woody base and a subtle blend of dry fruits, something like dried apricots or raisins rather than the overt sweetness of Middle Eastern dates.



The performance is legendary. Before you spray this, you need to sign a legally binding contract, as it will be your constant companion throughout the day. It projects powerfully for the first two hours, followed by a softer but still noticeable projection for the next two. On the skin, it lasts over 10 to 12 hours, possibly even longer, while on clothes, they'll smell like this even after you've put them through the washing machine.. twice.

Even though this is a highly likeable scent, if you're still asking your parents for permission to stay out past 10, you're probably not ready for this. It’s more suited for anyone above 20 who’s looking for something refined. This isn’t the typical ashy, smoky tobacco, instead, it’s an elegant and refined fragrance that could be worn by anyone, men, women, or even that mysterious figure lurking in the dark shadows of your home.

While it can certainly be worn in a professional setting if you control the number of sprays, it has a distinctly casual vibe. Whether you're getting together with friends or going on a date, this fragrance will undoubtedly make an impression.

This fragrance is strictly forbidden during the summer months. You could wear it in summer just like you could also wear a full suit of armour to a board meeting. However, for a summer date on a cooler night in an open, airy environment, you might get away with one spray, though I'd still recommend wearing it in air-conditioned settings. Where this fragrance truly shines is in the winter, when its depth and warmth really come to life.



**Should you get it?**

That’s a tough question to answer.

There are countless tobacco fragrances out there, some more refined, intricate, and masterfully composed. Yet, ask any fragrance lover to name the one that truly captures the heart of tobacco, and 9 out of 10 times, this is the one they’ll mention without hesitation.

At these prices, though, it’s a hard sell. While I can’t recommend buying it, I do suggest sampling it at least, because honestly, no clones quite capture its magic.

For me, this fragrance feels like a warm embrace, a scent meant for the quieter, softer moments in life. It’s not something I’d wear to step out into the world but rather to step away from it. It’s for evenings spent wrapped in a cosy blanket, with a steaming cup of coffee or chocolate milk in hand, and my favourite show playing on the TV. It’s for the simple moments in life we all crave, yet find increasingly hard to come by.

1hotjwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/theassholeclub/comments/1hotjwv/surviving_the_asshole_life/,Surviving the “Asshole Life” ,"
Hey there, fellow earthlings! 🌍 Let's chat about that journey of living an ""asshole life."" You know, those days when you wake up and decide, “Today, I’m going full chaos mode!” It’s like a sideshow where you’re the main act and the universe is just rolling its eyes—good times, right?

Imagine this: you step out of bed with a hairdo that suggests you just survived a tornado. You head to the coffee machine, but instead of brewing dreams, it’s just giving you a cup of disappointment. You take a sip and think, “Yep, just like my social life—bitter and kind of lukewarm.” ☕️

You stroll into work, and your coworkers are all smiles. Meanwhile, you look like you’re auditioning for a role as a disgruntled raccoon. They ask how you're doing, and you laugh maniacally while responding, “Living the dream! If this dream includes existential dread and spreadsheets!” 

Then comes the best part of the day—the walk to the coffee shop during your break, where everything feels like an Olympic sport. You dodge pedestrians like it’s an extreme version of Frogger. You might bump into a few people (No biggie! They were in the way, right?), and then you overhear someone say, “What an asshole!” You turn around ready to defend your title, and while your heart is racing, you realize—you care way too much. You shrug it off. After all, no one can give you a gold medal for being nice when you’re on a roll with the mischief!

Now, let’s be honest—living this “asshole life” can lead to some genuinely hilarious moments. Like that time you decided to sarcastically comment on someone’s awful music taste at a party and ended up bonding over your mutual disdain for ‘90s boy bands. Who knew that being an ass could bring people together?

But here’s the kicker—sometimes, this chaotic personality is like using a bullhorn in a library: it can be funny, sure, but it can also lead to some serious misunderstandings. You might lose a friend or two (or five), all while still crafting the perfect roast for that guy at the office who thinks he can outsmart you in trivia. 

At the end of the day, life as an “asshole” can feel like a roller coaster ride where you’re strapped in too tight, but hey, you’re moving fast! You might not win any popularity contests, but you’ll definitely become the life of the party…or at least the reason for a few eye rolls.

So here’s to us, the grumpy, sarcastic, and sometimes hilariously inappropriate humans navigating this world. Remember, it’s all about balance. Sure, be the punchline sometimes, but don’t forget to sprinkle a little kindness in there too; it can soften the edges of your rude remarks. Next time you bump into someone, maybe give ‘em a smile instead of a smartass comeback. Or hell, do both—they might just appreciate the humor in it all.

Cheers to the “asshole life”! May we embrace its ridiculousness with laughter and just a pinch of self-awareness. Keep it real, folks! 😜💖",1,1735469001.0,theassholeclub,0,1.0,False
1hotjm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1hotjm1/a_love_beyond_the_lines/,A love beyond the lines.,"Our affair has been going on for three years. We are both family people with children, yet what we share is more than fleeting lust. It’s a fantasy carefully built in the midst of reality, a connection that feels like an escape but is deeply rooted in understanding and care. What we have isn’t just about passion. It’s about filling spaces we didn’t even know were empty.

For her, this affair is about being seen and cherished in ways her family never could. I’ve become the one who listens when no one else will, who helps her find calm in her chaos. I’ve bathed her when life overwhelmed her, combed her hair when she didn’t have the energy, massaged away her worries, and brought her little gifts that say, ‘You matter.’ I’m there for her, always.

For me, it’s something entirely different. This affair isn’t just about breaking free from routine. It’s about rediscovering parts of myself I thought were lost. With her, I feel lighter, freer, and unburdened by expectations. She’s my muse, the spark that reignites parts of me I didn’t know I’d lost. Her perspective on life, the way she finds beauty in the smallest things, and her laughter that feels like music, has changed me. She doesn’t just inspire me. She reminds me what it means to truly live.

I’m a stereotypical romantic guy, but with my own quirks. I’ve sent her voice notes where I mimic her favorite characters just to make her laugh when she’s feeling low. Once, I spotted a flower on my way to meet her, picked it up, and told her it reminded me of her. It's mperfect but beautiful in its own way. I’ve sketched silly, exaggerated portraits of her just to hear her laugh at how terrible my art is. On one of our day trips, I surprised her with a picnic on a hilltop, complete with snacks I knew she’d love, and we spent hours just talking and watching the world below. Every evening, I send her a goodnight message with a random, quirky and corny lines about her, like how her laugh could cure bad weather or how she’s secretly the reason coffee tastes better.

We’ve even created little rituals that are just ours. For example, I sometimes slip tiny coded notes into her bag with lines from poems or private jokes that only we understand. We have a secret signal, like tapping my fingers three times on the table, to silently say, “I’m thinking of you.” Sometimes, we play a game where we pretend to be strangers meeting for the first time. We’ve given goofy nicknames to our favorite hangouts, like calling a café “The Mischief Corner” or a park “Snuggle Cove.” And one of my favorites is when we create imaginary backstories for random people we see, coming up with ridiculous scenarios and laughing until we can’t breathe. She doesn’t just tolerate these quirks. She encourages them, making me feel like the hopeless romantic I’ve always wanted to be.

She also fulfills my needs in ways I never expected. She brings emotional simplicity to my life. She understands my chaotic world and never adds to the stress. When I’m busy, she doesn’t bug me or demand attention. She knows exactly what to expect from me without ever asking for more, and her calm presence feels like a refuge from the noise of the world. She is my calm escape, not another obligation. 

She notices the small things I do and goes out of her way to show me that they matter. Once, she saved a tiny keepsake from a moment we shared and months later brought it up, saying, “That day meant so much to me.” It’s the kind of appreciation that stays with you. She’s spontaneous in ways that remind me how exciting life can be. One day, she picked me up and said, “Let’s drive and see where we end up.” It wasn’t about the destination. It was about the thrill of letting go and enjoying the moment.
She reconnects me with fun. During a walk, she suddenly challenged me to a race. We laughed like kids the whole way, and for a moment, life felt light and carefree again.

And intellectually, she has blown me away. She once read one of my favorite books, not because I asked her, but because she wanted to connect with me on a deeper level. When we discussed it, she tied the themes back to things I’d shared with her, showing me how deeply she listens and cares about my world.

I still remember one night when we checked into a hotel and she accidentally hurt her leg. She was struggling to walk, so I scooped her up and carried her to the room. It wasn’t just the act itself. It was the way she clung to me and the playful smile she gave afterward as she pretended to be hurt just so I’d carry her again.

It’s these small, intimate moments where I feel alive, where I rediscover the joy of spontaneity, care, and connection. She brings out the best in me, and in her, I’ve found someone who fills the spaces I didn’t even realize were empty. ​With her, I feel lighter, freer, and more alive. She’s not just a partner in this affair. She’s a reminder of the best version of myself.

My affair has redefined what I thought I knew about love and connection. It’s not just a break from reality. It’s a space where I can be fully myself, where imperfections are embraced and beauty exists in the contradictions.

I started from a pretty lowish point (not saying this is all ADHD, actually I'm still not sure what causes many things I'm experiencing) - waking up every day somewhere between ""just tired and somewhat awful"" (when I actually managed to get close to my necessary amount of sleep) and ""just kill me now my head hurts my eyes hurt I feel worse than when I went to bed WHY did I sleep under a truck again?"" when I didn't get my sleeping hours in. I wasn't able to concentrate in any meeting I hadn't a main speaking role in, generally sitting still in such meeting got pretty torturous, some days I had multiple daily anxiety attacks (at least that's what I would call it when I got a crampy angsty stomach out of nothing when receiving any slightly demanding (as in, someone asks me a question) email or thinking about a next meeting or whatever, most days I had at least one. Fun, and totally conducive to make my work performance even better. I regularly needed 10+ hours to complete some 6 hours of work, and I gave up any attempt at any hobby of mine for the last weeks since I had neither time nor energy for them anyway, let alone time for hyperfixating on anything. Did I mention nearly crying at my desk at 1 pm one day because I was so exhausted and couldn't fathom how I possibly could get anything of the things I needed to get done done? It got so bad I wasn't able to hide it anymore and some of my coworkers started to voice concern. 

My only source of short-lived dopamine was mindlessly scrolling through reddit and YouTube shorts, for fucking hours at a time (it had been bad before, and now it had gotten ridiculous. ""Hours"" is not an exaggeration). Every social interaction I had to do on top left me even less functional for the following day or two. I dared to meet people on two consecutive weekend days one week and Monday / Tuesday of the following week were even more fucked up than anticipated. Getting two 3 hour adhd assessments within three weeks' time where I had to recount my whole less-than-happy life story twice, do tests and answer questions also didn't help. 

**Entering meds**. I was given the choice of starting with methylphenidate plus something against anxiety or just the methylphenidate alone, and I took the second option. I started my first titration week of 5mg IR twice a day. I was about to enter luteal phase and only got about 6 hours of sleep at night since I regularly woke up at 4 or 5 and was unable to get back to sleep, so not the best condition to test medication, but well.

**First week**: a bit less tired, a bit more able to concentrate, and, very surprising - no anxiety anymore? I crashed at 1 between the first dose petering out and the second dose kicking in and at about 5 pm when the second dose wore of, but still it helped. At work the goals and tasks became concrete and high-stakes, so that probably played the most part, but the methylphenidate definite helped with the tiredness death-grip, especially since I've gone off coffee at the same time. And I was suddenly doing tasks at home. After work. Without working myself up to it by procrastinating two hours on reddit first? What sorcery was this?! 

**Second week**, I upped to 10mg twice a day. Also I entered the Christmas holidays. No more work but pretty much back-to-back social functions starting on 21st until the 29th.

First, I definitely noticed some emotional blunting at the beginning. The anxiety was gone, but with that my risk taking went slightly up (less scared about the consequences) and I noticed that I got pretty meh about everything. Not depressed, but definitely not as enthused about anything either. I had time and energy, but no desire to do much. A very interesting side effect of that: my interest in scrolling on reddit was also all but gone lol. I also felt pretty weird in the first social interaction on drugs with people, like I didn't know how and what about to speak with them. Also my head was quieter, which at first freaked me out because I felt empty until I actively thought about something. This gradually faded in the evening when the second dose wore out until I felt normal again. 

This resulted in me spending some hours researching the dopamine system, rewards, its interplay with adhd drugs and pondering whether the increased functionally was worth living a life of ""meh"" lol. I seriously considered stopping titration until I was able to speak to my psych in January again.

I didn't since I came across some accounts of the weird emotional side effects being transient, so I wanted to use the holidays to test this out safely (ie not at work) and... it's great now! I feel normal again, only way less tired, therefore more energy (and desire) to do stuff, easier getting started on anything, no anxiety anymore, still pretty low desire to spend my time on Reddit. I made it through all the holiday parties, still wanting to live afterwards and do stuff and even had fun. Amazing. I've done more stuff I've actually wanted to do in the last two weeks than I had done in a long time, holidays and weekends included. 

I still have to check out timing and dosing (I have the OK to go up to 30mg before consulting again), since right now I take my first dose at 10, second at 14:30 and this likely won't work with working), but for now, it feels like having at least some part of my life back.

Hi everyone, i'm a 19 year old guy who just wants to improve his physique.  
I've been going to the gym for a year and a half now so (3 times a week, now four) and i know more or less how gym works, however i've never followed a diet.  
Many people says that diet is the most important thing, even better than going to the gym to have a nice physique, by going to the gym only i went from 54 kg to 65 kg (i don't know if muscles or body fat, but i sure notice some gains) and i wanted to increase my gains by starting a diet.  
I lack the money to be followed by a nutritionist so i wanted to rely on a diet written by chat gpt.  
so my questions are:  
1) is diet really so important? if so, why can't i assume my daily kcal just by eating trash food?  
2) can someone tell me if this diet can be a good option to follow?

I am wanting to read AUs (you know the drill: coffee shop, fantasy, whatever alternate existence that is different from canon but still featuring the cast of BNHA) but I'm having trouble picking them out one by one when using the filters and sorting options of AO3. It's easy to find the ones that have been recently updated, and it's easy to discover the ones with the highest kudos, but there's definitely gems out there that just have less kudos, OR that simply have already wrapped up some years ago and therefore don't filter near the top. Lend me your brains please, any good recommendations for alternate universe fics? I especially love fics that are DRASTICALLY different from canon, so stuff like fantasy AU, post-apocalyptic AU, historical setting AU, etc. 

The less drastic ones that aren't quite AUs but are canon divergent, like where one character doesn't have a quirk or two characters swapped roles, are sometimes interesting and will be considered, but aren't exactly what I'm after.

I am looking for the following dynamics :

1. One where I can praise you and simp for you, and worship you. 
2. I wanna be your virtual assistant, where I'll help you plan your day, curate to-do lists for you, take care of your calenders, reminders etc. 
3. Research topics or handle online tasks you dislike (e.g., finding the best deals, trip planning, etc.).
4. Curate playlists, podcasts, or book suggestions tailored to your tastes.
5. Keep track of your preferences (e.g., favorite coffee, snacks, or relaxation routines) and suggest ways to make your day smoother.
6. Research venues, themes, or gifts for your personal celebrations.
7. Suggest creative ideas for outings or self-pampering days you can enjoy.
8. Create a collection of memes and stuff that helps you feel relieved when stressed, or when looking for some laughter.

Since she knows about as much about hardware as a horse does about coffee, she figured she’d remove the side panel of my case, take some pictures of the hardware, and ask ChatGPT for advice with the right prompt.

She ended up buying not only a great GPU but also a decent PSU since I only had a 500W one. For those commenting about other card benchmarks and nuances, you’re missing the point. I’m highlighting her creativity, resourcefulness, and, most importantly, her understanding and support for my hobbies. It’s amazing that she’s willing to go for even pricier gifts when she knows it’ll make me happy ❤️.

1hotc7b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hotc7b,Trying LOL OMG clothes on Draculaura (part 4),"Hello everybody ! Hope you’re having a nice holidays season ! ❄️☃️
Since we’re all in a winter mood (unless you’re in the Southern Hemisphere 🙃), let’s have a winter theme restyle again, and try to use clothes from the Snowlicious doll on Drac G3 ! 
I was expecting lots of good things from this OMG, but the final results are very « meh »…

Big disappointment from the wool underwear : the top barely close, and the panties don’t have any stretch. Big bummer.

Next : the white pants. On Snowlicious, they’re super long (bell bottom style), hiding the shoes. So on Draculaura’s longer legs, they’re the right size ! The legs have room, the fitting is easy.
However, it’s a low cut, so the molded panties on Drac’ are totally visible. Kinda bummer, but cute clothing.

The main pink top is great ! Just the right length to hide the torso articulation !

The fur coat is a good surprise ! The sleeves are super large, you don’t even need to remove the doll’s hand to put it on ! I already had another white fur coat, but this is the superior one !

The big fur hat is… a look. If the furniture around your doll are moving left and right, maybe you can use it, lol 😝 

Regarding the accessories, they’re a mixed bag. 
The backpack (which is flocked…!) is usable, but I didn’t dare try it with the coat : the straps seems a bit fragile.
The baby blue pouch / holster can close around the leg, but not at the waist, or vice versa. I wasn’t feeling it that much, but it’s still a accessory « going to waste ».
The earrings fits way better that other LOL OMG earrings I tried in other posts ! Weird, but good !
There is a small compact mirror with little horns, very monster coded. Better than the black one we got with SS 2 !
And the coffee cup is hard to keep in Lala’s hand, like seen with the Dollie fashion thread.

Bonus accessory : the LOL surprise little sister comes with teal ear muffs that kinda works if you don’t pay to much attention to the height of Draculaura’s ears ! Me, I’m gonna use it on a Barbie with big hair !


Hopefully this thread was (or will be) useful for someone ! 🤗
I still have one OMG outfit and two Rainbow High outfits to try, before deciding if I continue to buy clothes from others doll lines, or if the costs/results aren’t efficient 🤔💶

If you have tried some other outfits, please share your pictures with everybody ! 🙏

He came into our lives after nearly 5 years of trying, and every smile and coo feels like magic. But this season of life is absolutely relentless. I’m exhausted, and I’m sure my wife is even more so.

Here’s a snapshot of what our life looks like:

* **I haven’t had income in almost 1.5 years.** The tech job market has been brutal, and I need to focus on finding work now that things are improving. But the endless pressures of parenting and supporting my wife make it feel impossible to carve out time for applications or interviews.
* **My daily routine revolves around baby and mom:**
   * **10–11 AM:** Wake up.
   * **11 AM–1 PM:** Drink coffee, eat oatmeal, and either play with or feed the baby.
   * **2–4 PM:** Lunch, house chores, help my wife with the baby, and put him to sleep.
   * **4–6 PM:** Snack, shopping, and entertaining the baby.
   * **6–8 PM:** Assist with bathing and diaper changes.
   * **8–10 PM:** Help soothe the baby and put him to sleep, deal with frequent fussiness.
   * **10 PM–12 AM:** Brief “me time” with frequent interruptions.
   * **12–3 AM:** Feed and burp the baby, with occasional small breaks.
   * This schedule isn’t fixed, but most days follow a similar pattern.
* **My wife is sleep-deprived and exhausted.** She vents frequently, which I completely understand, but it adds to the emotional strain.
* **Feeding is a logistical challenge.** Our baby is 50% formula-fed and 50% breastfed (via bottle). My wife feels constant pressure to pump every few hours to maintain her supply, which adds a lot of stress to both of us.
* **Sleep is a nightmare.** The baby wakes up every 50 minutes at night. He won’t take feeds from me easily except late at night, so my wife shoulders most of the burden. I try to help where I can, but I also have a health condition that requires uninterrupted sleep to stay well.
* **Leaving the house feels impossible.** Even short outings often lead to inconsolable crying.
* **We’re burning through savings.** Neither of us is working (my wife stopped due to a complicated pregnancy). We have part-time help for 2.5 hours on weekdays, but even that costs $1,300/month.

We’re also cautious about accepting help from nearby family due to cleanliness concerns. Meanwhile, we avoid cry-it-out methods for sleep, which feels like the right choice for us but adds to the pressure.

**A small silver lining:** My wife and baby will be going to her mom’s place in Asia next month, where we can afford more help. But we need to survive another 1.5 months before then.

Every day feels like a Sisyphus moment: rolling a boulder up the hill, only to start over the next day. We love our baby deeply, but I can’t help feeling like we’re doing something wrong. Is this normal? How do other parents manage?

Would love to hear your experiences, tips, or just a little reassurance that this gets better. Thanks for reading.",1,1735467514.0,NewParents,1,1.0,False
