Every single time somebody makes one of these videos next thing you know they‚Äôre trying to sell coaching/ courses. It never fails.

Is the law of assumption just some money making scam?

They all follow the same formula. Sammy Ingram did it first. Made videos talking about it and then claimed she wasn‚Äôt gonna be doing coaching. And now look.

Thousands of people have popped up on YouTube, TikTok, Facebook etc doing the same thing.

Has this ever even changed anybody‚Äôs life like they claim? I‚Äôm not talking about little things like seeing a green car, getting a text message,finding $5 on the ground or free coffee. I‚Äôm talking about big stuff. Houses, cars, large sums of money, marriage, etc.

I‚Äôve been trying for ages to win a certain lottery jackpot. If I affirm a lot I‚Äôll win free tickets or up to $100 and even had all the numbers match‚Ä¶ but they were spread across multiple tickets I bought. Idk. It‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù (First post in thread)

By focusing on fewer, high-quality [decoration items](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), minimalist decor brings an air of elegance and calm to any space. Whether you‚Äôre looking to refresh your home or adopt a completely new aesthetic, this guide will help you create a stunning minimalist look using carefully curated pieces like [boho wall decor](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/wall-hanging-decorations), [decorative items for living room](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/), and [natural home decoration](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations) elements.

# 1. Embrace Neutral Colors and Clean Lines

The foundation of minimalist decoration is a neutral color palette. Shades of white, beige, gray, and earthy tones create a soothing ambiance that works as a blank canvas for your decor.

Incorporate **boho wall decor** in neutral or muted tones to add texture and personality without overwhelming the space. Think macram√© hangings, woven art, or framed nature-inspired prints for a minimalist yet warm vibe.

# 2. Prioritize Functionality and Quality

Minimalist design emphasizes quality over quantity. Every item in your space should have a purpose while contributing to the overall aesthetic. Opt for multi-functional **decorative items for the living room** like storage baskets, stylish trays, or elegant shelves that keep clutter at bay while enhancing the room‚Äôs look.

# 3. Incorporate Natural Elements

Nature-inspired decor seamlessly fits into minimalist interiors. **Natural home decoration** pieces such as wooden furniture, stone accents, and indoor plants bring life to the space while maintaining simplicity. Consider these tips:

* Add potted plants like snake plants, succulents, or fiddle-leaf figs for a touch of greenery.
* Use materials like bamboo, rattan, or linen for furniture and accessories to create an earthy, grounded atmosphere.
* Incorporate handcrafted **decoration items** like ceramic vases, woven baskets, or rustic wooden trays to add charm.

# 4. Declutter and Organize

A clutter-free environment is key to achieving a minimalist aesthetic. Reduce the number of **decoration items** to only those that spark joy and contribute to the overall theme of your home.

In the living room, a single statement piece, like a bold piece of **boho wall decor**, can act as the focal point. Complement this with simple, functional items like sleek coffee tables or minimalist bookshelves.

# 5. Focus on Textures for Depth

Minimalist spaces often rely on texture to prevent them from feeling too stark or cold. Use soft textiles, woven fabrics, or textured **decorative items for the living room** to create visual interest.

For example:

* Layer cushions and throws in neutral tones on your sofa.
* Use a jute rug or textured wall hanging for a cozy and elegant touch.
* Add **boho wall decor** with intricate patterns to balance simplicity with artistry.

# 6. Let Light Be the Star

Natural light is a hallmark of minimalist interiors. Open up your space by using sheer curtains or opting for no curtains at all to let sunlight fill the room. If you need additional lighting, choose minimalistic fixtures with clean lines that double as **decoration items**.

# 7. Add Personal Touches

Minimalist decor doesn‚Äôt mean sacrificing personality. Infuse your style into the space with curated pieces that reflect your story. Frame travel photos, display a favorite ceramic vase, or hang **boho wall decor** that resonates with your journey.

For the living room, choose **decorative items for the living room** like handmade sculptures, candles, or books to create a space that feels personal and inviting.

# 8. Minimalism with a Boho Twist

If you love the carefree elegance of bohemian aesthetics, combine it with minimalism for a unique take on decor. Pair **boho wall decor** with neutral furniture and simple lines for a balanced look. For example:

* Use a macram√© wall hanging as a statement piece.
* Add woven ottomans or poufs for functional seating.
* Incorporate terracotta pots or driftwood for a natural, artistic touch.

**Final Thoughts**

Minimalist decoration proves that less is more. By focusing on intentional choices, neutral tones, and quality **decoration items**, you can create a serene and elegant space that feels both stylish and functional. Incorporating elements like **boho wall decor**, **decorative items for the living room**, and **natural home decoration** ensures that your minimalist home is anything but boring.

Here‚Äôs a guide to understanding how to choose and arrange interior furniture for a harmonious, stylish, and functional space.

**Understanding the Importance of Interior Furniture**

Interior furniture is more than just a collection of items; it‚Äôs an expression of your personal style and lifestyle. The furniture you select affects how you interact with the space and influences the mood and comfort of the area. Thoughtfully chosen furniture pieces can elevate a room‚Äôs design, while poorly chosen furniture can make the space feel cluttered, uncomfortable, or disjointed.

**Types of Interior Furniture**

The vast range of interior furniture options available means that there is a solution for every style and need. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the main types of furniture commonly used in home interiors:

**1. Seating Furniture**

* **Sofas and Sectionals**: The centerpiece of many living rooms, sofas come in various sizes, materials, and styles ‚Äî from sleek modern designs to classic, cozy sectionals.
* **Chairs**: Lounge chairs, accent chairs, dining chairs, and armchairs offer flexibility in seating arrangements, with options ranging from ergonomic to decorative.
* **Recliners and Ottomans**: For added comfort, recliners allow relaxation while ottomans can serve as footrests or additional storage space.

**2. Storage Furniture**

* **Bookshelves**: Essential for storing books, decorative objects, and personal items, bookshelves can double as artistic elements in a room.
* **Cabinets and Sideboards**: These are great for storing dishes, linens, or other household items while adding elegance to dining rooms or living areas.
* **Dressers and Wardrobes**: These pieces are designed for clothing storage and are often key pieces in bedrooms.

**3. Surfaces**

* **Tables**: Coffee tables, dining tables, side tables, and desks provide surfaces for work, meals, or decor, and come in an array of styles and materials.
* **Console Tables**: These long, narrow tables are perfect for entryways or hallways, offering space for keys, decor, or mail.

**4. Accent Furniture**

* **Lamps and Lighting Fixtures**: Lamps are both functional and decorative, adding to the room‚Äôs ambiance and visual interest.
* **Mirrors**: Not only do mirrors serve a functional role, but they can make a room appear larger and brighter, reflecting light and adding elegance.

**Choosing the Right Furniture for Your Space**

When selecting furniture for any interior, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind both the function and aesthetic you wish to achieve. Here are some key factors to consider when choosing furniture:

**1. Space Planning**

* **Measure Your Space**: Before purchasing furniture, measure the room carefully to determine what size pieces will fit comfortably. Avoid overcrowding by leaving enough space between furniture pieces for movement and flow.
* **Consider Traffic Flow**: Ensure there is enough space for people to move around comfortably. The arrangement of furniture should allow for smooth transitions between different areas in the room.

**2. Style and Theme**

* **Match Your Decor**: Choose furniture that complements the existing decor. If your home has a modern, minimalist style, opt for sleek lines and neutral tones. For a more traditional or rustic look, consider wooden furniture with rich textures.
* **Color Coordination**: Furniture should complement the color scheme of the room. For instance, neutral-colored furniture like beige, gray, or white is versatile, while vibrant, bold colors can be statement pieces.

**3. Material Selection**

* **Wood**: Wood furniture is classic and timeless. It brings warmth, texture, and natural beauty to the room. Types of wood such as oak, walnut, and teak can be used for a variety of furniture styles, from rustic to contemporary.
* **Metal and Glass**: These materials offer sleek, modern aesthetics and are often used in minimalist or industrial designs. Glass-topped tables or metal chairs can add sophistication to a room.
* **Upholstery**: Fabrics like cotton, linen, velvet, and leather can be used for seating furniture. Choose a fabric that suits the style of your space while being durable and comfortable for everyday use.

**4. Comfort and Functionality**

* **Ergonomics**: Comfortable furniture is essential for creating a relaxing and functional space. Ensure seating options are designed for long-term comfort, especially for items like sofas or chairs.
* **Multi-functionality**: Furniture with dual functions, such as sofa beds, extendable dining tables, or storage ottomans, can maximize the utility of a space, especially in smaller areas.

**Tips for Arranging Furniture**

The way you arrange your furniture has a significant impact on the look and feel of the room. Here are some tips for effective furniture arrangement:

* **Create a Focal Point**: Arrange furniture around a focal point, such as a fireplace, television, or large window, to create balance and flow.
* **Symmetry vs. Asymmetry**: Symmetrical arrangements work well in formal spaces, while asymmetrical arrangements often create a more dynamic, casual atmosphere.
* **Leave Breathing Room**: Avoid pushing furniture directly against walls, especially in living rooms or dining areas. This allows for better flow and a more open, inviting space.
* **Group Furniture Together**: In living rooms, arrange seating in intimate groupings to foster conversation. In dining rooms, keep enough space between chairs for ease of movement. Visit here:¬†[**McMillan furniture Yale mi**](https://www.mcmillanbusinessinteriors.com/)

**Conclusion**

Interior furniture is a critical element of home design that affects both functionality and style. Choosing the right pieces and arranging them thoughtfully can transform your space into a comfortable, aesthetically pleasing environment. When selecting furniture, always consider your needs, the size and layout of the room, and your preferred design style. By investing time and care into your furniture choices, you can create a harmonious living space that reflects your personality and meets your practical needs.

I've been talking to this girl for a while, I kept seeing her on facebook and snapchat quick add and added her in September, I said ""Yo I kept seeing you pop up in my facebook quick add and thought you were cute, wanna grab sushi sometime?"" She said sure, and we planned for the next wednesday, she had something come up so we replanned, then ghosted me the day our date was planned for. 



She never unadded me, I was drunk and like 2 weeks later I snapped her ""Sushi tomorrow?"" she apologized for ghosting me, and said that she had just gotten out of a long term relationship and thought she was ready to get back into dating but she wasn't. I kind of assumed that she was saying that because she wasn't interested in me specifically. 



Fast forward 2 months, she didn't unadd me after that either, I was drunk again and snapped her ""Sushi tomorrow? pt 2 lmao"" fully expecting her to say no. She ended up saying yes, I said I was free at 11 if that worked but I was actually busy the rest of the day. She said she had to work at 11 unfortunately and that we could plan for another time. 



She kept being unresponsive and I got kind of annoyed and said ""You know you can just say no right?"" after she hadn't responded to my message in 2 days. She wrote a whole ass paragraph that she did want to go out but she was just super busy with work and that me being pushy rubbed her the wrong way and that she was no longer interested, I responded saying that I felt that the effort to find a day that worked for both of us was not reciprocated and that the communication felt one way, I didn't know how bad her work schedule was and that I wouldn't have been an ass if she had communicated that to me, I apologized and wished her the best and that shed find someone. She apologized for the bad communication and said that I seemed like a decent person. She also said she wasn't actively looking for a relationship and that shes waiting for one to find her, and that shed be cool with continuing as friends with me and that she was open to it turning into a relationship in the future.

  
another 2 weeks later after we had talked for a bit, just friendly conversations, I had invited her out for coffee, she said yes, we ended up walking through a local nature reserve, we talked a lot and had a good time. about 2 more weeks later after trying to find something that worked with her work schedule, I asked her to hang out and proposed we could get dinner and she could join me to lose my weed virginity, she agreed and said it sounded fun, we ended up not getting dinner because she was tired af from work, I picked her up and we drove around and smoked in a park together, I smoked WAYYY too much, she eventually asked me why I chose to smoke with her for my first time, and why I had never smoked before, considering most of my friends smoke a shit ton of weed too (we have some mutual friends from hs), I sort of had doubts and responded asking if she thought we were hanging out as just friends or if we were on a date, because that was the impression I was under, she said she thought we were just hanging out as friends. I said that I had a different impression and I asked her to smoke with me because I wanted an excuse to hang out with her.

  
I asked another couple of weeks later if she wanted to hang out with one of our mutual friends, her fiance, and I at their place, I was gonna give smoking another try because I had a terrible time the first time, smoking too fucking much and all. She agreed, we played some party games, we all had a good time, she hadn't seen this mutual friend in like 8 years since middle school so they had a good time catching up. That was about 2 weeks ago, and last night she asked me how it was going, she said that she was bored af, i asked if she wanted to do anything, she said sure, then fell asleep when I asked if she had anything in mind, she woke up at like 10 and apologized, I asked if she still wanted to hang out she said yes, we were planning on drinking and just hanging out but we mutually decided it was a bad idea, she had work the next morning at like 7:00 AM and that we could see about hanging out another time. She also gave me her actual phone number at some point during the exchange.

  
I'm not really sure what to think; I think in the VAST majority of cases when someone says that they were just getting over a breakup in a long term relationship, they are just trying to let you down slowly, especially because I am not a good looking guy. But then it ended up being true, and in our later exchange she said we could proceed as friends and maybe it would turn into a relationship later, I'm not sure if she means shes just open to it or actively thinking about me as a relationship prospect. Maybe shes just waiting to get to know me better, I want to ask her exactly how she feels about me; i value open communication a lot, but I also feel like saying that directly might kill my chances of her seeing me in a romantic light. Should I just wait and see how things turn out? Should I ask her? Do you think she sees me as just a friend or a potential future relationship?

He always looks me deeply in the eyes while making his order and turns his head my way whenever he‚Äôs leaving. I liked him and his energy a lot and I‚Äôve been crushing on him but never had the courage to talk to him. He seems to be very quiet and reserved. My colleague tried to make a small talk with him once but he totally wasn‚Äôt into this. 

I think he also at some point realised that I like him because he started being quite nervous around me. I noticed him looking at me and fidgeting a lot. I met him few times randomly on the street and he gave me this prolong eye contact and was following me with his eyes. 

Few weeks ago he came for a coffee few times and while waiting for his order he was more open and was looking at me like he was trying to make me look at him. I kinda felt like he wanted to tell me something with his eyes. It was so strong. He even gave me a shy smile when he was leaving. But I was totally paralysed and intimidated. Yeah I‚Äôm a shy girl.. Unfortunately lately he stopped coming in, I just see him almost every morning passing by the cafe but he just looks my way and stares a little at me but doesn‚Äôt come inside anymore. 

Also, my friend who has a hair shop just next to his house told me that he noticed that my crush always after work goes somewhere and comes back home late evenings and he‚Äôs also away the whole weekends. And it‚Äôs been like this since he remember and that could suggest that he‚Äôs actually seeing someone. 
And now after hearing this I‚Äôm not sure if I should risk and try to approach him. I totally loose the confidence I tried to gain for the past few weeks. 
I really don‚Äôt want to scare him with talking to him and also I guess id have to be direct and straightforward because he‚Äôs definitely not the type who feels comfortable doing small talks.

I have been taking my Bupropion 150 XL right before sleep.  I started doing this 1 year ago to combat side effects. ( I used to get very tired +2 hours after ingestion )

Since then (???) I get high anxiety in the morning.  I had recently had my blood work done, I have high cortisol ( stress hormone ) in the morning.  Its actually pretty bad, its stops me from eating.  The thought of food makes me nauseous in the morning.  So according to me, my body is in a stress condition.

I used to combat this by going for a run first thing in the morning, to burn off the cortisol or stress or whatever.  It worked,  but due to circumstances, I am not able to continue this routine.  ( because I overstressed both my knees, I can only walk. Running hurts!  and because of practical reasons (its wintertime, sun only comes up at 10 am only to set again at 16pm

It usually gets better during the day.  After lunch I feel level ( ie no elevated anxiety ).  But the cycle repeats every morning.  Last time I was here, i stopped talking my meds because of this. I do not want to make the same mistake this time, I cannot afford it.  

Do any of you experience the same?  I know I could cancel my morning coffee, but that's like one of the things that I look forward to, to get out of bed.

My prescribing doc once said ""Maybe  that's because you are taking the med at night, so its full force in the morning.""

I asked, the doctor will not but me back on Methylphenidate, I should stay on Wellbutrin.  But this morning anxiety is starting to get hard to endure.

Maybe I should reconsider taking it at night and start taking it in the morning again?

I am looking for advice on buying a new machine (and grinder) with limited espresso experience (beginner)! I come over the pourover world and already have a Ode 2 grinder for my filter brews. I often get espressos while I'm out and would like to venture into the espresso game as a gift to myself.

My budget is $2500-3000 (in US) and I'm willing to splurge for myself, but saving money wouldn't be the worst of things. Expectations of drinks would be mostly just straight espressos or cortados for myself daily, the wife would have the occasional cappuccino/latte on weekends or matcha lattes (so milk steam?). 

For the grinders I have gone through analysis paralysis. I would love to eventually consolidate my grinders to one (if possible) to minimize the counter space (spouse approval factor) and was looking at the more expensive grinders Mazzer Philos, Zerno Z1. However since I already have an Ode 2 for my filter coffee have seen other recommendations of Timemore Sculptor 064 or Niche Duo to save a little bit of cash. 

For the espresso machines I've gone back and forth in regards to single boiler vs dual boiler, but have been leaning towards dual boiler because buy-once/cry-once mentality (have a bit of change to spare) and would be nice to have when doing multiple milk drinks. I have been looking at the following machines: Profitec Go (single boiler) and then Profitec Move and Silvia Pro X. 

In terms of my drink types, I tend to be all over the place with my pourovers. I tend to like dark or light roasts depending on my mood. I have not adventured as much into espresso to know my likes yet, but enjoy a bright, juicy light roast (currently using Gummy Worms from B+W), but also medium/darker beans from local roasters.

Edit: why I don't just stay at my desk like everyone else is my desk has no sun nor window. I like to be a plant and take in some sun from time to time. Not a major inconvenience I know, but it's a small pleasure I don't think I should be punished for.",0,1733987020.0,legaladvice,4,0.5,False

Outside Snacks could be samosa, poha, jalebi, dhokla, chips, fruit cakes, cold drink or juice or lemonade, or tea/Coffee.


2. Friendly Vibes Only: Be kind and welcoming to everyone. We want an environment where people feel comfortable, so please leave any dark humor or ""savage"" attitudes at home. üòá


3. Comfort and requirements: Wear something comfortable that allows you to sit, walk, and enjoy the time without any fuss. Please try to bring a bedsheet, use and throw spoons, napkins or tissue papers, garbage bags/polybags so we can clean the space post picnic. 


4. Punctuality Matters: Please be on time! It‚Äôs important for everyone to be part of the introductions, and late arrivals can disrupt the flow. ‚è∞

1hcfi11,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1hcfi11/my_roommate_invited_a_homeless_woman_to_live_with/,My roommate invited a homeless woman to live with us.,"This happened a couple years ago, I (24M) was 22 at the time when my friend Philip (25M) who was then 23 invited me to live with him to save on rent. Philip and I worked at the same office together and had become friends. We were the youngest people at our job and our cubicles were pretty close to each other. Philip had this really cool apartment that was above a bar; it had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a big kitchen and a huge living room. He was trying to save money so he could buy a house and invited me to live with him. I still lived with my parents and I thought this would be a great opportunity to be more independent. 

On the day I moved in, I carried some of my things up to the apartment and knocked on the door. Phil opened it, I came inside, and I saw a woman standing by the kitchen counter. Phil introduced me as his roommate and the woman introduced herself as Sinead. I didn‚Äôt really think anything of this, Phil and I were both single so I expected we would have women over from time to time. Phil then said that Sinead would only be here for the weekend and then would leave on Monday morning. 

After I moved all my stuff in, I struck up a conversation with Sinead. She seemed cool but also let it slip that she was 42 and that she was homeless. This took me by surprise and I pulled Philip aside and asked ‚ÄúWhere did you find this woman? And did you know she was homeless?‚Äù He said they matched on Tinder and he was fully aware of her living situation. He actually picked her up from a coffee shop a few blocks away from the homeless shelter. I told him that this was a little crazy but as long as she was gone by Monday then I could put up with how weird this was for a weekend. 

Monday came and I woke up to see that Sinead was still at the apartment. I went into Phil‚Äôs room and asked what was up. He said that he started to have feelings for Sinead and didn‚Äôt want to kick her out just yet. I told him that we had to go to work and that I didn‚Äôt necessarily feel comfortable with having her stay in the apartment by herself. He brushed it off and said ‚ÄúShe literally has no where else to go, have a heart dude. Plus even if she did steal something, where would she take it?‚Äù I reluctantly agreed and we went to work. 

When we came home, Sinead had cleaned the whole apartment. It was a nice gesture but I still thought it was weird and I didn‚Äôt exactly love the idea that she went into my room. Even though I had just been living there a few days, I still don‚Äôt like my things to be touched. I politely asked her not to go into my room and she complied. Nothing eventful happened that night, beyond the moaning I heard coming from Phil‚Äôs room. 

The next morning I saw that Sinead was still here yet again. I asked Phil when she planned on leaving, he told me ‚ÄúDude, she cleaned the apartment yesterday. And she‚Äôll probably clean it again today when we go to work. She‚Äôs like a bang-maid, maybe she could live here a while longer.‚Äù I told him that this was a horrible idea but I relented because I felt like it was still *his* apartment and that I was just renting a room (which I decided to lock before leaving). We left and went to work; but that night shit had hit the fan. 

When we came home, everything was normal. Sinead was there, the place was clean, and my room was still locked. The evening was calm and nothing to write home about. However, late at night when I was in my room I heard Phil and Sinead screaming at each other. I couldn‚Äôt make out what they were saying but it got pretty bad; I heard what sounded like a plate or mug being thrown and shattering, doors were slamming, and it sounded like a bunch of pots and pans were clanging together. Phil‚Äôs door slammed again and I heard Sinead moving around in the kitchen. Phil then started texting me asking if I heard any of that. I told him that I did and asked what was going on. What Phil sent me made my jaw drop‚Ä¶

Apparently, Sinead was a diagnosed schizophrenic and had been off her meds for a while. If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, she also told Phil that she thought we were going to hurt her and that she was thinking about killing us in our sleep before we could try anything. Naturally, Phil freaked out and this is when the fight ensued. I told him ‚ÄúGet this crazy woman out of *our* home, now!‚Äù He then told me that he wasn‚Äôt so sure, and then gave me a sob story that Sinead also has MS and narcolepsy. I told him that I didn‚Äôt give a shit, and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel intimidated in my own home. He finally agreed and said he would kick her out tomorrow; in the meantime, I locked and barricaded my bedroom door with everything I could find. 

The next morning came and Sinead was still in the apartment just chilling on the couch. Phil came out of his room and said he was going to work early, I asked him why and he said that he just needed to take his mind off of things. I then asked him about what we talked about last night and he said he would handle it. I was left alone with her, and even though I could overpower this woman if she attacked me, I still felt extremely uneasy and vulnerable. I went into my room to start getting ready for work when my mom called to ask how living in the apartment was going. I was telling her everything that happened when I heard Phil‚Äôs bedroom door slam shut. I walked out of my room and saw that Sinead was no longer on the couch and that Phil‚Äôs door was closed. I told my mom to hang on for a moment while I listened to the door and heard what sounded like crying coming from Phil‚Äôs room. I backed away from the door and continued talking to my mom and getting ready. A half hour or so had gone by and I was about to head out the door when I saw that Phil‚Äôs room was now open. I saw Sinead sitting on the bed crying while Phil was there trying to console her. I didn‚Äôt even hear him come back to the apartment, and I asked what happened. He said for me not to worry about it but to tell our boss that he was going to be late. 

When I came into the office, all of our coworkers in our department asked me what happened to Phil. I asked what they meant and they said that he came into the office for maybe ten minutes before just leaving without saying a word. Phil‚Äôs older brother was also a manager of a different department in our office and apparently he was on the phone with Phil after he left. My coworkers told me they heard his brother yell over the phone ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt get her to leave, I will come down there and drag her ass to the police station myself!‚Äù My coworkers and my boss asked me what the hell was happening with Phil. I told them that he had some personal stuff going on and it wasn‚Äôt my business to share. My boss then told me ‚ÄúI need to know right now what‚Äôs going, otherwise I‚Äôm going to have to fire Phil for leaving without saying anything. As your boss, I‚Äôm ordering you to tell me what‚Äôs going on!‚Äù I panicked so I frantically explained ‚ÄúPhil has been banging this homeless 42 year-old who he invited to live with us and last night she said she was going to kill us in our sleep!‚Äù My boss and coworkers burst out laughing with my boss saying that was the funniest thing he had ever heard. Everyone kept asking me for details and I spilled everything about the situation. I turned to my boss and told him that Phil must be kicking her out now but that he said he would come in later today. 

The day continued and there was no sign of Phil, my boss then asked me what time Phil said he was going to come in. I told him I didn‚Äôt know but that I would text him to find out. I shot Phil a text, and he replied saying he wasn‚Äôt going to come in. I told my boss this and he became frustrated, saying that he needed to figure out what to do with him. When work was over I began to drive home and stopped at a Wawa for some food. I texted Phil to see if he wanted anything, no reply. I tried to call him, no answer. I tried to call again, straight to voicemail. I began to get concerned, so I grabbed my food and rushed home. When I pulled into the parking lot of our complex, his car wasn‚Äôt there. I hurried up the stairs to our apartment and the door was unlocked, all the lights were off; and all the cupboards, cabinets, and dishwasher were open. It was so bizarre, I didn‚Äôt know what to make of it so I tried to call him again. Again it went voicemail, and I really began to be worried for his safety. I called my boss and explained the scene I came home to and how I couldn‚Äôt get ahold of Phil. I asked my boss for Phil‚Äôs brother‚Äôs number so that maybe he could get ahold of Phil to make sure he‚Äôs okay. Right as my boss was giving me the numbers, Phil texted saying that he was on his way home and would be there soon. I told my boss that Phil texted and thanked him for his time. 

When Phil came home, his eyes were bloodshot, as if he had been crying. I asked him what happened and he said that he tried to kick Sinead out but she wouldn‚Äôt leave. He had to call his parents to help kick her out and she still refused to leave. It took threatening to call the cops to finally get her to gather her things and leave our apartment. Phil then told me that he packed all her stuff into his car and took her back to the homeless shelter she came from. 

When they got to the shelter, the front desk denied letting her back. They told her that her spot was gone due to the email she sent them the previous night. Phil turned to her and asked what was this email. Apparently, the night when they got into that fight; Sinead had sent the shelter an eight paragraph email detailing that she was in a safe space now and that they could give her spot to someone else. Phil flipped out, realizing that Sinead had fully planned to never leave our apartment. He asked the receptionist what they could do, and she informed him that there was sister location in the city 25 minutes away, but that they could only take her in the morning. So Phil took her to a hotel and paid for her to stay for a few nights. When he told me this I said that he was the biggest idiot I‚Äôve ever met, and what was to stop her from trashing that room or raiding the minibar and spending a lot of his money. He said that she wouldn‚Äôt do anything like that, and I had to explain to him that he has only known her for less than a week and that he essentially does not know this woman. He began to cry and said ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand, I think she‚Äôs the one. I love her man, she‚Äôs the kind of person you only meet once in a lifetime.‚Äù I told him ‚ÄúYeah I sure hope you only meet her once, and never again.‚Äù He cried some more and told me he had planned a vacation to his aunt‚Äôs beach house in Georgia, and that he was going to take Sinead. I told him that he could still go to the beach house, it wasn‚Äôt like his vacation was ruined. But he then said that it would be too weird going by himself just to visit his aunt. 

I told Phil ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to tell you man, but I think you just need to take a break from women. You‚Äôre trying too hard to fall in love when you should just live life and let things work themselves out. Learn to be yourself without anyone else.‚Äù He told me I was right and that he would take a break for a while, but by the end of the week he was already dating another girl. All of this happened in the first week of me living there; and while he did do other shitty things while we lived together, this one was definitely the craziest.

1. ""And how does that make you feel?"" - The bread and butter of our field. If I had a dollar for every time a client said, ""Stop asking me that!""‚Äîwell, I wouldn‚Äôt be paying off my therapy degree loans for the next decade.

2. The degree vs. the pay. Spend thousands of dollars on a master's degree, jump through flaming hoops to get licensed, only to end up making less than someone with a bachelor's degree in marketing. But hey, who needs to eat out anyway?

3. Boundaries are a joke. We preach self-care but then spend our weekends filling out case notes, fighting insurance companies, or wondering if we handled that one session wrong. ""Don't take your work home,"" they said. Well, Karen, my work lives rent-free in my brain.

4. Clients with Google degrees. ""I read on WebMD that my anxiety is caused by a gluten allergy."" Oh, sure. Let me just unlearn everything I spent years studying because Facebook said so.

5. Supervisors and licensing boards. Jump through 4,000 hoops, document everything perfectly, attend 17 years of supervision, and pay all the fees...just for them to lose your paperwork or take six months to approve it.

6. Our glamorous wardrobe. Do you know what screams ""professional therapist""? A wardrobe of slightly pilled cardigans, pants with an elastic waistband (for the sitting all day), and shoes comfy enough to chase after that one kid who ran out of the play therapy room.

7. Mental health stigma. Society: ""We need more therapists!"" Also society: ""Wait, you‚Äôre a therapist? Are you analyzing me right now?"" Bro, I‚Äôm just here for my overpriced coffee. Calm down.

8. The endless acronyms. CBT, DBT, EMDR, SFBT, ACT... It's like Pok√©mon for grown-ups. Gotta learn'em all!

Two basses, I have, and two replacement preamps to be wired up.

The other - BTB 1935 - has Aguilar DCB‚Äôs from factory. Those are dual coil, blade-style ceramics, fully covered.

At hand are two preamps; a Darkglass ToneCapsule and an Aguilar OBP-3 (both 3-band EQ).


I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out which preamp would go well with either set of pickups, and it may not even be of much use in the end. But still, any insights and inputs are appreciated.

1. I have an online friend from a music website and we share tracks to listen to. I can see how many stars they rate the singles I send and get secretly upset when they rate it just three out of five stars. I almost feel like I'm letting them down or wasting their time by not sending them songs they would like.
2. When people invite me to hang out, I almost feel like I'm the host and I have to be the one making sure they're the ones having fun or entertained. Whenever there's awkward silence I get scared they're bored of me and that they'll regret inviting me.
3. I met a girl in person for the first time off of BumbleBFF and we got along just fine; not great nor terribly. But I think she thought there was no vibe or connection because she hasn't responded to my ""nice to meet you text, we should get coffee some other time"" text. I felt that I bored her or there was something she didn't like about me, when realistically it takes two to make a connection and maybe she's just not right for me. I might just be very sensitive to perceived rejection.

However, even the beginner guides or league starter guides have A LOT of terms that you would need to look up for the guide to be understandable; it goes like this:

""...for 3.25. You will need to SRS the BRS and to GQT the mobs to SFJ and suffix prefix the HGLK for the yellow maps (?)...""

1hcf685,https://www.reddit.com/r/LLcMasterclass/comments/1hcf685/how_a_small_coffee_shop_in_kenya_ended_up_with_a/,How a small coffee shop in Kenya ended up with a U.S. LLC and why it matters.,"Last year, I stumbled upon a fascinating story.
A small coffee shop owner in Nairobi was shipping speciality beans globally,gaining attention from international buyers.

Their business was thriving, but there was one problem, their payments and contracts often delayed because overseas partners hesitated to work directly with a Kenyan company. 

The solution? A U.S. LLC

In less than three months, their story took a dramatic turn.

U.S based clients felt more confident signing deals with a registered  U.S entity.

The U.S business bank account made it easier for them to get paid faster and in dollars.

Their LLC opened doors to funding opportunities they hadn't even considered before.

This isn't just about coffee.
From SaaS startups in India to solo creators in Brazil, I've seen how a U.S LLC can act as a passport to global business.

But here's the kicker, it's not as simple as filing paperwork and calling it a day.

Theres hidden hurdles:

If you don't structure it correctly,  you could end up paying taxes in both countries. 

Bank account approvals can feel like pulling teeth, especially if you're not physically in the U.S.
Compliance,  miss one deadline, and you could face penalties that wipe out your gains.

So, what's the secret sauce for getting it right? It's not about doing everything yourself. It's about asking the right questions and finding solutions that fit your specific situation. 

For example, would it surprise you to know that you don't need to live in the U.S. to get an EIN or register your LLC? Or that the right LLC structure can help you avoid double taxation?

Here's my question to you?

Have you ever thought of expanding globally?
What's holding you back from taking the leap?

Lets swap stories! I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments. If this resonates with you, I have shared more insights and resources on my profile. Check it out, you might find something that sparks your next big idea.",1,1733985478.0,LLcMasterclass,0,1.0,False

Big Brands and Motion Graphics: The Beyonc√© of Marketing
You ever notice how big brands treat motion graphics like a VIP lounge? It‚Äôs like they‚Äôve got the red carpet, the flashing lights, and a voiceover saying, ‚ÄúOnly the chosen ones may enter!‚Äù But guess what? You don‚Äôt need to be Nike or Coca-Cola to use motion graphics. You just need‚Ä¶well, a product, an idea, or even just the guts to say, ‚ÄúHey, let‚Äôs make this pop!‚Äù

Small Business? More Like Small Screen Superstar!
Look, small businesses, you might think motion graphics are ‚Äútoo fancy‚Äù for you. But what if I told you they‚Äôre not? Picture this: your local coffee shop‚Äôs social media post showing beans spinning like a Michael Bay film intro. Boom. Suddenly, you‚Äôre not just ‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs Coffee.‚Äù You‚Äôre ‚ÄúJoe‚Äôs Cinematic Coffee Adventure.‚Äù Motion graphics can elevate any brand‚Äîbig or small.

Budget Woes? Welcome to the Discount Aisle of Creativity
Here‚Äôs the thing: you don‚Äôt need to break the bank to get motion graphics. With today‚Äôs tools, you can get high-quality animations without selling your left kidney. Platforms like After Effects, Canva, and Blender? They‚Äôre your new best friends. Think of them as the fast-food of motion graphics: quick, affordable, and oddly satisfying.

Engagement: The Motion Graphics Magic Spell
People are scrolling faster than ever. Your static post is like a mime shouting in a rock concert. But a sleek motion graphic? That‚Äôs the electric guitar solo that makes everyone stop and say, ‚ÄúWhoa, who made THAT?‚Äù Whether you‚Äôre selling soap or software, a little motion magic makes you unforgettable.

Motion Graphics for Everyone: No VIP Pass Needed
So here‚Äôs the punchline: motion graphics aren‚Äôt just for big brands. They‚Äôre for anyone with a story to tell, a product to sell, or an audience to impress. You don‚Äôt need a $10M marketing budget. All you need is a dash of creativity and the willingness to experiment.

Mic Drop Moment
Big or small, motion graphics can transform your marketing game. So stop thinking of it as the exclusive playground of corporate giants. Dive in, get creative, and let the graphics do the talking. Or spinning. Or exploding. Whatever works.

My partner and I are hoping to go on a short holiday around Christmastime for about 3 days and currently have our hearts set on Duluth after reading through some of the older posts here. We moved to southern Minnesota earlier this year from a tropical country and have adjusted reasonably well so far to the weather here so hopefully the cold wouldn't be a big problem.

However, we do have a few questions in mind before we make any reservations:

1. We are not comfortable with driving in the snow, so we will be taking a shuttle there. We plan on staying at the Fitger's Inn (there are still rooms available according to their website). Is the area good for tourists without a car, or would you recommend another hotel? Or would you say that maybe Duluth isn't the best place for tourists on foot in general. Budget isn't a huge factor so long as we get a nice view and a walkable neighbourhood since we'll probably be spending a lot of time indoors anyway.
 
2. We will probably visit the Railroad Museum and take some walks by the lake and that will be it. We do know about Bentleyville but have read that it may be crowded so we most likely won't go out of our way to see the lights there. Are there any other attractions within walking distance that you would recommend to first-time visiters who aren't really that outdoorsy? We like looking at beautiful scenery but would prefer not to be IN it if that makes sense. We certainly don't mind walking though.
 
3. Being unfamiliar with the cultural context surrounding Christmas, when would you say is the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù within peak season this time of year? Would it be more crowded before or after Christmas or is it pretty much the same throughout the holidays?

Thanks for making it this far; this post turned out to be a lot longer than expected.
Any advice on...anything, really, is greatly appreciated. We're around 30 y/o if that helps. We also love a good coffee and good food and are open to any local recommendations. We look forward to visiting your city!",5,1733985271.0,duluth,6,0.86,False
