I use a small electric kettle (Seaker Travel Kettle) and power it directly from my trucks built in power center. Coffee ground using Timemore Xlite. It's a bit of a challenge brewing while driving, even though this truck has some autonomous driving features...so I did the responsible thing; I stopped and prepared the coffee, brewed it, plunged, then got back on the highway. Sorry ""Charbucks"", you'll never see me in your drive thru! Lol",2,1731269311.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

The things I’m looking for are places that serve coffee and have outlets. I like that the space is larger and not cramped, so it isn’t overwhelming even when it’s busy (like Denver Central Market). I do enjoy having people around when I’m working, so hopefully there are some other spots that have similar vibes.

Any other spots come to mind? I’m open to anywhere in Denver.",0,1731269195.0,Denver,0,0.5,False

So I’ve been dating a girl who’s new in my country for nearly 3 months now. Great start, meeting once a week/once every 2 weeks which i was very comfortable with. She’s not the best with punctuation but I’ve looked past that a few times, until about 3 weeks ago I had reserved a table for us on a Friday and we had agreed to go on a date, as it had been about 2 weeks since we’d last met.

I message her on the day just like , hey all good for tonight, to which she replies that she’s in x location(her younger brother who is very important to her had visited) and that she won’t be back down in y location. 

This pisses me off a small bit, totally cool with her doing her own thing but just a heads up during the week would have been nice to cancel the reservation and not lose money on it. So I say that, hey, just in future could you let me know a little sooner if you have to cancel? 

She doesn’t respond for 3 days (quite unlike her, we had been pretty much texting everyday since we’d met) apologising. Grand, no problem. 

Then that entire week it’s radio silence. No response to my texts or anything. She’s watching my stories but just not responding, even liking a few. 

This leads to me bringing it up , I try calling no answer so i text her and say that I’m not sure what the situation is rn, and what’s going on. 

We end up talking, over text, and she tells me that she wants to take things slow and thought I was on the same page. I’m kinda confused by this as it wasn’t really communicated and the sudden switch up in her demeanour made me think the worst (chronic overthinker I’ll put that out there now). 

She then tells me she thinks we’re not on the same page and that I’m ahead of her in terms of pace, which we discuss and I bring up a few things.

Firstly, there were things she was doing that I thought were her trying to progress things quickly! Like tagging me in her story on dates (including the first one) with love hearts and shit, her little brother following me on IG, telling me she really likes me twice. This all made me feel that things were going quick and that I kinda had to match that pace. 

So we talk it out over text, she clarifies that she wants to take things slow - because she broke up with her first and only boyfriend in April and it was a very toxic relationship- now she simply enjoys doing things on her own and regaining her freedom in a sense.

She also said that she’s not looking for a serious relationship rn but also doesn’t want to just see people casually. She wants to take things slow given the recency of her breakup, totally fair.

At the end of the discussion she says it’s okay, let’s go over. To which I respond with “as in, are you comfortable with continuing?” (English isn’t her first language, and I just wanted clarification) 

I also mention that I’d prefer if we talked about this next time we met just to fully clarify things, as the whole thing had come as a bit of a shock. She just ignored that and then a day later asked how  thing on the weekend went, and then we start talking a small bit, one day I respond to her questions and follow up with “hey, if you’re free, how about a coffee next week.

That was last Friday, just left on sent for 9 days now. Like I’m cool with taking things slow but this is a crawl that I’m not 100% comfortable with tbh. Like the ignoring of texts (I haven’t been blowing her up, just one or 2 sentences in response usually) just doesn’t feel right to me.

I’m thinking of saying this to her and trying to clear things up but at the same time I don’t wanna overbear as it clearly seems she needs space.

I don’t really know how to approach this with her?",1,1731269010.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Some missionaries came to my apartment building and I agreed to chat with them, just humoring them at first.  I've always been a Christian and don't mind hearing different churches' perspectives.  Before I knew it though, they asked me if I'd be willing to be baptised.  Though hesitant at first, I agreed to go ahead, because I had been to church a couple times and it has given my faith a boost.  .  I recently had my first meeting with the local bishop who wanted to discuss a temple recommend, and while discussing the interview questions, the topic of the WoW naturally came up, at which time I told him I've been a coffee drinker since my youth, and he told me I'd have to stop drinking coffee before he could give me a recommend.  I admit I'm upset over this.  Coffee is a part of my life, especially since I'm not a morning person and sometimes have trouble waking up no matter what time it is.  Coffee is how I coax my very unwilling brain/body to wake up and get moving, and we're only talking a few cups a day here, no more than half a pot.  I'm also aware that there are far worse things out there than coffee, which comes from a natural source.  I don't think I can do this.

Not saying that I'll be becoming politically-passive, but unlike a week ago, I truly just don't see or feel any patriotic worth or pride in the post-Nov5th America after what my fellow-Americans just allowed &/or the trajectorial, moral inversion that will be unleashed upon our America & its Democracy come January 21st.

I'm hoping for some advice on this. I am a 31F living in Canada. Where I live there aren't any walk in clinics available and I don't have a doctor's office I can easily get to. I have Telehealth through Telus so I use them for most of my issues as it's the easiest thing for me.

So Friday Oct 18 I ended up hitting my foot really hard against my coffee table in my living room. I heard a crack that sounded like knuckles cracking and it hurt a lot for like 5-10 minutes. I was worried that maybe I broke my pinky toe but nothing seemed out of place so I just carried on my day. As the day progressed it started to feel a little swollen and as Saturday progressed it was more numbness down the side of my foot, a little throbbing pain and swollen a bit. I ended up talking to a Nurse practitioner on the Sunday morning (Oct 20) and they advised that I should get an x-ray just to double check there wasn't a break. I went and got an x-ray the following day. I should mention that I was still walking on my foot just kinda limping to not put pressure on the toe area. I also noticed a bruise appear below my fourth toe on the under part of my foot (which is still there today).

 I had to wait a week for the x-ray to come back. When I talked to the NP again on the following Sunday (Oct 27) the x-ray results came back that there was no visible fracture. At this point since the numbness, swolleness and pain was progressively getting worse the NP suggested that I see a sport therapist to ensure there wasn't a muscle, tenden or nerve issue going on. So on the Tuesday (Oct 29) I went in and saw one. He started massaging my foot and then he hit the corner of my foot near the fourth and pinky toe and it hurt a lot. At which point he stopped and asked to look at my x-ray. He said that to him it appeared I did have a fracture and that it looked like I had a fracture below my fourth toe on the palm of the foot. And that it was possible there was also a fracture on the pinky toe and fourth toe too. But it was hard to tell because the x-ray wasn't very clear. He told me that I needed to wear a boot to stabilize the foot and allow the bones to heal for 6-8 weeks and suggested that I get orthotics for my shoes for when I start wearing sneakers again. Up to this point I was still walking around on my foot but after this appointment my pain started to increase and by the weekend (Nov 2) I could no longer walk on my foot anymore because it was too painful.

 I ended up making another appointment with the same NP for Thursday (Nov 7) and told him that the pain and numbness was getting increasingly worse. At which point he said it was really important that I see a Sport Medicine Physician. So he referred me to one. I was told that I would most likely be contacted by them the following week. I tried calling the centre on the Thursday but they told me that they hadn't gone through the referrals yet and that it takes them 3-5 days to sort the referrals and triage them. Whenever I do get a call from them I most likely won't be able to get in for a couple weeks. 

Now the NP did say that if it increasingly got worse or too painful then I should just go to the ER. The problem is that personally I don't think the pain is that bad as long as I'm lying down I tend to not have much issues in regards to pain. The thing that more worries me is that aside for the pain/numbness in my foot I've noticed that it has spread to my calf (below the knee) where I am having a little bit of numbness and also it is super cold to touch from the knee down. It is abnormal because the other leg is a normal temperature. So I am worried about that. I feel weird going to the ER because it doesn't feel like an emergency but on the flip side I have no clue what actually is going on with my foot and I will most likely have to wait a minimum of another 2 weeks before seeing a doctor about it. Should I just wait to see a doctor or should I just go to the ER and have it looked at? ",1,1731268447.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

We used to be the perfect couple. We were that couple that our friends would point at to be described as “relationship goals”.
And for a while, I really believed that I would have a future with her.
But the last month or so has made me realize that she just doesn’t make me happy anymore. And to be quite honest, I no longer love her.
Last month I got a good promotion at work. And as can be expected, more money means more responsibility. I have been working 50+ hours a week because that is what my new position requires.

She does not understand that. She works a regular 9-5.
Lately she’s been starting arguments with me now about how my hours suck and she hates me working where I do because I had to sacrifice time that I would normally spend with her.

She has accused me of cheating on multiple occasions in the last month with the girls I work with simply on the basis that I happened to become good friends with them regardless of how many times I have reassured her that I am not cheating. Because I’m not. 

She gets mad at me when I get called in to work on my days off because it means she won’t get to see me. 
Which I do understand. 
However, when I told her about my promotion and new schedule and how I would be on call 24/7 and all 365 days of the year, she assured me that she didn’t mind because she was so excited for me and proud of me getting a promotion I had worked really hard for.

Just the other day she called me crying because I don’t have time to text her, call her, or leave work to go get coffee or lunch with her while I’m at work anymore, and then started yelling at me about how every day she gets ready to hang out only for me to “crush her expectations” by having to work early the next day or having to stay late at work.

I have had multiple conversations with her trying to explain that I don’t always have the time to talk or hang out or do anything because of work. I don’t even get to see my friends or my family or do my hobby stuff anymore because I just don’t have time for it.
It always ends the same though. She just gets upset and starts talking about how what I do isn’t fair to her because in her words, she has dreams about what kind of lifestyle she wants to have with me and I’ve been making that impossible.
But her dream lifestyle is honestly pretty unrealistic. 
She wants us to spend every night together going on cute fun dates or having a night in or spending every holiday together while we save up money and then take a few months off from work to travel around the world and plan our wedding and honeymoon then get married when we come back home only to go abroad again to have the honeymoon.

I want to leave and end the relationship very badly because of this last month. I don’t think there’s anything that could salvage this relationship.
I gave it everything I had. I really did. I was patient, I did everything she asked, I tried talking to her, but in my opinion she just started being selfish and quite frankly childish as well.
And I really do hate to say it but I don’t think I can continue a relationship with her.

We’re from TX and have never been out to Cali, so we’re hoping for a brief, but nice change of scenery. 

Apologies if I sound like an asshole, but idk how else to describe the type of areas we are looking for lol. 

Our ideal location is one that boasts plenty record stores, vintage/antique stores, clothing boutiques, coffee shops and of course great food. We visited Seattle a few months ago and we loved the Fremont neighborhood, just to give an idea of something we like. If it’s pretty walkable and diverse that would be a huge plus, we are Chicano(a)s and live in a brown and black neighborhood so we love both cultures, but overall, we’ll vibe with anybody.

Thank you all for your recommendations!

I paid ~$200 for it, and I'm willing to spend double that, maybe triple if it's truly worth it.

* Fellow Ode Gen 2

My first job was very toxic, and I was sexually assaulted after a year. I finally got a new job, hoping it would be a fresh start, as I was going through a lot mentally and physically at the time. Unfortunately, that job was just as bad; I was treated with disrespect, and because I didn’t speak Italian, they let me go. After that, I found another job where I met amazing people, but the company was still toxic, and I ended up getting fired. 

Then the big boss from that company found me on Instagram and tried to chat me up, which was awkward. Eventually, I landed a job I really loved, but then COVID hit, and I was made redundant, back to square one. I had a few temp jobs during lockdown, and when it lifted, I got offered a job that was absolutely amazing. I loved everything about it and received so much praise for my work. However, a year later, new managers came in, and everything changed.

I really wanted to pursue a career managing coffee shops, so I thought I had landed my dream job. However, it turned out to be mentally and physically exhausting; I was only paid £10 hourly for managing a busy coffee shop with no support, not even an assistant manager, and the owner treated me poorly, which forced me to leave. I then found another job, but the owner was deeply in debt with suppliers and consistently paid us late, leaving me no choice but to look for other options. My next job was with toxic coworkers, including bullying, and the owner didn’t care at all. Now, at 24, I’m in my current job, which started off great for the first couple of months, but then everything changed. I’m now stuck doing 13-hour shifts with no breaks, and I get reprimanded if I take a moment to use the restroom. 

I feel lost and stuck, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m exhausted and just want to give up. I’ve had 14 jobs by the age of 24, and I can’t help but wonder if I’m the problem.

I am looking for someone to take over my portion of a lease in Brighton by January 24th (flexible!), with an option to renew. The lease is up August 31, 2025.

1 bedroom available in a 3x1. You'd be rooming with 2 of my best friends (both women) and the bestest & sweetest doggo ever, Waffles! Must be dog friendly. 🙂

I do have the smallest room of the 3, but pay less in rent as a result: $1100, plus shared utilities (internet, gas & elec).

I am preparing to move out of state and would like to sell my furniture as well! My desk, mattress & bed frame (a full), and dresser are all brand new from September. Let me know if you'd be interested in some or all (I'm thinking \~400 for all). Otherwise, the rest of the apartment (kitchen, dining/living room, & bathroom) is fully furnished.

Great perks:

\- in unit laundry

\- balcony

\- lots of natural lighting!

\- attentive & responsive landlord

\- close to bus routes (the 57, which connects to the 66 and the green line, and the 86, which connects to the red line)

\- free street parking, though to be transparent, it fills up quickly and you sometimes have to go a street or two over (still free)

\- you'd have very friendly, clean roommates who'd love to be friends, or at least be friendly with the new tenant!

\- the Y is right behind our building for anyone interested in a gym nearby, the library is very close as well, as is a small park

\- the Charles River is a \~20 minute walk

\- lots of great food options around, including Glasser Coffee Co, which has become everyone's favorite breakfast spot

\- stop & shop is about \~20 minutes away by bus via the 57, or 12 minutes if you're able to catch the 64, but lots of things are even closer by car if you have one



The ideal roommate:

\- lgbt+ friendly

\- clean

\- young professional

\- no other pets preferably

  
Let me know if you're interested! I'm happy to answer any questions and provide additional info. We're also happy to schedule an in-person or virtual tour, if interested. :)

While training these two it sure has been a ride with some things - persistence, patience, and dedication pays off. We practice training every day, and while our Aussie mix (left) is 3 years old and has settled down quite a bit, the training sure showed itself today for the both of them. 

We waited outside the gas station while my boyfriend went in to grab a drink, and I had both the dogs in a down-stay. Our Aussie girl (13 mo. old, on the right) is hyper-social reactive so she gets way overly excited when she sees people and dogs. She stayed in her down and watched as people walked by, got out of their cars, etc. They did so good while waiting for their dad! And the entire walk we had this morning they truly did amazing when seeing other dogs and people walk by.

I know some people may have difficulty with this breed and I really think we got the craziest puppy of the litter (our Aussie girl on the right), but man seeing the training pay off is big time awesome. Keep at it and just know it’s gonna make such a huge difference as your pups grow! 

I’m excited to one day be able to take our little girl to busy places and not try to jump on people, being overstimulated, etc. I love seeing all the adorable Aussies at the farmer’s market just being so good, or even just hanging out at a coffee shop, so it feels like we’re getting much closer to being able to do that some day ❤️.

Currently been off medication for 8 days for a bit of a reset and I’m just noticing my behaviors. Here is what I am aware of so far.

1. Anger=Dopamine. I’m super quick to anger, rage and frustration, I know that my brain is doing this to hit me with some extra dopamine but I feel I have very little control in stopping it. 

2. Cookie Monster. My bad eating habits have returned and I wouldn’t be surprised if I’ve gained 10 pounds in the last week. I made a vanilla and rum caramel last night at 11:30 pm when I should have been going to bed. It was damn delicious but I shouldn’t have done  that lol. 

3. Thoughts galore, I’m just noticing the whirlwind of thoughts that are swirling through my head like a whirling dervish of pure madness, it knows no ends and will stop at nothing. 

4. Dopamine fiend, I see that I’m playing more video games and watching lots of tv/movies to keep myself entertained, it wasn’t this way on medication it was much more balanced. 

5. Shopping spree, time to pay some of that adhd tax because my spending has gone through the roof, between Uber eats and Amazon I think my spending is up like 400%, I just spent 150$ on a luxury fidget kit set, not gonna lie it’s pretty awesome though. 

6. Give me all the caffeine!! I’m drinking way more coffee, I went from having one tea per day to having 3 coffees plus 1 tea. I seem to need that right now in order to get through the days. 

I’m sure there is much more but considering we all have adhd I’ll leave it at that for now. I’m recently 
Diagnosed at 36 and grateful to have a new opportunity at life, I’m weirdly proud to be part of this insane club we didn’t ask to be in. Wishing you all the very best. ",1,1731266540.0,u_Big-Recognition-6714,0,1.0,False

1go8e6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1go8e6k/im_so_tired_of_my_parents_and_siblings/,I'm so tired of my parents and siblings,"Hello everyone, I don't know if you will see this post but I wanted to vent and rant about a lot that's going through my mind right now. Perhaps maybe some of you could relate in some way.
Buckle up cause this is going to be a long one. 

I feel sick and tired of my parents and my siblings. 

Some pre-information before I dive in. I'm currently 18 and a boy. I live with my parents and will probably live with them until I can get a job or until I go to university. My parents are strict and asian

My mother and my father have no energy left for me. I'm the youngest child. They never seem to care about my emotions or how I feel. I could be having a bad day and they won't care. They never seem interested in what i have to say, sometimes it feels like they can't even see me. 

For example, my mother is always glued to her phone, she is always on the phone talking to her siblings or mother and father or other family members everyday. And if she isn't doing that, she is playing games on her phone, and if not that she is watching dramas on her phone. 

Look, I respect her and love that she entertains herself with stuff to do. But its so bad to the point that she doesn't hear me and doesn't pay attention to me if I'm talking to her. She wears ear buds. For God sake, she only ever wears one in her ear but never hears me. For context, I could approach her and be talking to her. She will glance at me and then look back down at her device. I will finish my sentence or whatever the hell I was saying then she will look up and say ""what??"" Then that causes me to repeat. It sometimes happens that I have to repeat myself like three times that I get tired and walk away. 

Now my father, he has no energy, all he ever does is sit on the couch and watch depressing news. If not that he opens his phone and reads depressing news articles or does something related to his job. He listens to me but couldn't really care about me as he says that I should shut up as he doesn't have the energy to hear me. 
Sometimes he will get my hopes up by actually acknowledging me and hearing me and what I have to say. Then after a few days it will be like we never talked and he is suddenly a different person. 

Not to mention, both of them, especially my dad has very bad mood swings.

When you are raised by very very strict parents, you have to think twice before you act or speak. 

I'm 18 but I was also 17 and 16 and 15 and 14 and 13 and etc. 

I noticed this emotional neglection started off when I hit 13. Maybe even before, but It hurts so much when you're parents are emotionally unavailable. 

Another issue I have with my parents is that fact that they love to threaten me. Like if I don't score well, they will threaten me. I already feel like a burden for them having to pay for me having to write my exam papers but that's not my fault, I don't understand why we have to pay for exam papers but it really puts so much pressure on me that I have to perform perfectly. I feel so scared that I will know that I fucked up on an exam and then until results day, I will eat myself up in my thoughts as my parents scare me. They used to hit me a lot when I was younger, now they just shout more and are more verbally abusive. 

I used to think that them punching me or hitting me was bad but the things they say to me is way worse and more painful and words take longer to heal than bruises or wounds. Words really do kill you for many years even after that moment passes.

They threaten me if I stand up for myself, they threaten me if I look at them in the eyes showing them that I'm hurt. One thing that makes me go insane is when they hurt me or my feelings and say to me that I have no right to get sad or upset at them. Like God forbid I act like a normal human with emotions. They don't get to decide how I feel and what hurts me. I cannot believe I have to be shamed for expressing my emotions and that I'm angry or dissapointed or that I'm sad or hurt by them. 

Moving on. I never really had the ability to buy whatever I liked growing up. I used to see others online buying stuff or things that makes them happy. Like for example, when I was a kid, Disney Infinity was a very popular game. I used to love to go to ""toys r us"" and buy the characters figures so that I can play with them in the game. On my birthday I remember many years ago during that period, I went into the shop and I wanted to buy some for my birthday as a gift for myself. My mother made me cry and shamed me and shouted at me in the toy store while everyone was watching. At the end she bought it for me and I walked out of there with tears running down my face, my face and eyes were red and swollen. 
I was just a child. Even if she didn't want to buy them for me on my birthday, she didn't need to go so extremely on me back then. Another example is I really loved legos and still do, I don't know why it brings me joy building them. I used to buy as a kid but my mother used to limit me which isn't an issue as I respect that she was teaching me to understand that I couldn't just grab anything in that store. I haven't bought legos in years. Last year I saw that lego flowers were trending on Instagram and I loved the sunflowers personally so one day I walked with my mother into the lego shop, I showed her them and she said, ""I thought we were done with legos.. Are you stil a kid?? You are embarrassing for you're age. Im ashamed of you"" I was only 16 at the time and was almost about to turn 17. We walked out and she shamed me infront of my dad and got him involved and he also shamed me in public. 

I remember in 2022, It was Christmas season and I really wanted to buy something. My mother said you can buy whatever you want. So I found a site which was selling kpop albums and I loved a few albums and wanted to buy, I told her and she said ""no, I can't believe you want to buy stupid albums. Why are you so weird, I thought you were done with those korean shits"" so after back and forth of her I eventually settled in buying second hand albums off Instagram, the girl who was selling gave me such a good deal and I told her about my mom, she felt sad for me so she gave her posters to me free but only charged me on the albums and said if I grabbed a few she would give a discount. It was a beautiful purchase and I got my bias's photocard but second hand items are usually not in the best condition, two of my albums had scratches and one of them the pages were coming out. 

I had always dreamed of buying Kpop albums ever since I loved kpop since many years now, my first ever purchase sadly was a second hand not in the best condition. The reason I went from and official kpop store selling new kpop albums to a second hand seller on Instagram is because of the price difference and deal and I thought that i should go for the cheapest option as I took into consideration my mother would have to pay for it and i didn't want her to pay so much money.

The process of buying the albums from the instagram seller was hell because in the process I remember my mother shouting at me and shaming me and making me cry like she always does. I told her ""why can other people my age buy albums that makes them happy but I can't?? "" she got more upset. Eventually she bought it but the memories I have whenever I look at my albums now makes me sad. My dad also said to me after the purchase ""we don't buy albums in this house!! Control yourself"" my parents hate the term ""fan"" they say they think fans are obsessed and sick people. They say if you watch something or listen to something, there should be no reason to buy something about that topic as that makes you sick and obsessed. 

That aside I must add that my parents hate kpop, ever since I loved the genre of music, they used to do some God awful things to me and say stuff to me over the years that I will never forget. For example in 2018, I bought a kpop magazine which had stickers and posters inside. It was not official but at the time, I thought to myself that this is probably the closest I'll get to buying Kpop merch. Then a arts project came up at school where were asked to draw a celebrity or a person we admired. I chose Rosé of Blackpink and Jungkook of BTS. So we had to print pictures of the inspiration photos, I sent a memory stick with my father to his office where I had asked for him to print the photos of jungkook and rosé for my school project, I had a sport tournament on the day when he was printing them, I only got home around like 6 p.m and then I was called out of my room after I had changed my clothes. I noticed that something was wrong and off about my parents. I feel really anxious and it felt like my heart was beating in my face. I went into the living room to see the photos on the coffee table. My mother yelled and shouted at me. She said that someone at my father's office came up to my father and said why are you so obsessed with this girl and printing her photos. My mother sadi that I embarrassed my dad at work today. As much as I felt bad, I didn't understand what the issue was as my father requested that i get my inspiration photos printed at his office so I had no other choice and if I never printed them, my school would get angry at me. 

At the end my father shouted at me. He broke a glass on the table out of anger. My mother grabbed me by my ear and took me to my room. She ripped up the photos and said I'm too young to print pictures of a woman. I never had bad intentions as I really loved blackpink and bts at the time, so I picked two members to draw for my arts project. 

After a few minutes after I was beaten up and was dealing with the pain on my body and my swollen eyes from crying. She came back in and asked for that magazine and hid it from me. I never saw it for years. It was only around 2022 Christmas Whej she wanted to give it back to me during Christmas and I went searching for her as she dissapeared from the living room. She was in the storage room and had that same magazine in her hand. I pretended I didn't see and walked out. She never gave it back. And said she threw it into the garbage where it belonged before Christmas. 

Then came that Monday when I went to school, I was sitting in class. Some of my friends which were girls said they noticed that my face looked off and that it looked like I was swollen. My legs and back were bruised from the punching and smacking. I broke down in tears. In arts class, my teacher came up to me and got angry that I didn't have my inspiration photos. I told her my parents ripped it up. She felt bad and said that I should just do something else. When the arts project evening came up. All my classes arts were on display and only mine was the odd one out. People came and walked by wondering why mine was the odd one. I just smiled and had to lie and hide my pain. 

I even have flashbacks of my mother walking into the classroom and throwing my lunch sandwich on the floor or at me. There were many other instances similar to this but I'd rather not say because as I type this I feel my throat is heavy and also it's just too much that I will get tired listing it out. 

Luckily though, now in life I don't get physically abused by my parents in terms of being hit or smacked in the face and punched or suffocated.
It's more verbal abuse now but it still hurts. 

I would add that for the past 3 to 4 years, I have batted and suffered with depression, severe anxiety and dpdr. 
I had two existential crisis last year in 2023. I also am prone to frequent panic attacks. 

I remember it being so bad that my own mortality scared me, I couldn't breath well and couldn't sleep well at night. I suffered a lot alone and on top of that, I was dealing with trauma from encounters with online perverts who said some disgusting things to me. Those traces back to 2020 and 2021 when I thought that making online friends was a good idea. I met good and bad people but I was only 13 or 14 when all that happened online. 

Usually you would think that one should talk to their parents for guidance and help but I never told them out of being scared of them and that they would take my phone away from me and limit me. 

I only told my mom last year but my dad doesn't know still cause I know he will never be able to process it. 

I also almost took my life in 2022 because exam stress got too much and I have no teacher as I'm homeschooling and doing everything on my own. On top of that my father had a heart attack and stroke which took a different toll on me and changed me forever as a person. That happened to him right before my birthday so I spent my 16 birthday alone at home while he was in hospital with everyone else. Obviously he has healed a lot since then. But I started to realise that 2022 was the worst year for me of all. The thought that that could have been my last year is terrifying. 

My parents don't really care about the fact that I was very suicidal back then. They say I'm pathetic and useless. They are the kind of parents that don't believe in mental health issues. 

I have never been to a therapist. I actually was going to start anti depression tablets and my mom shamed me saying that I'm weak and will get addicted to them. I had to stop it after only taking like two.

Just this year I wanted to buy myself a self help book to handle my emotions and pain as I have no one or nothing to help me. I eventually got it but at what cost??? I was shamed  and yelled at and called weak and useless for it. It's actually been a very helpful book. I just feel sad that no one takes me seriously. 

Just last week we went to a big mall. I really love WEDNESDAY and wanted to buy the Wednesday Addams doll from toys r us. I walked in there with my mither and showed her. As soon as she saw the doll. She got very angry and upset. She said ""I'm embarrassed that you at your age want a doll, this is for girls, you are embarrassing, you are weird""

I only wanted the Wednesday doll as a decor in my room as I really loved the netflix series. I wanted to keep it as a memory of something I love, also because season 2 is coming out and I'm exited for it. 

I walked out of there, what hurts is last week she opened a credit card under my name cause im now a classified adult, it's my father's money on that card but she said that I could buy whatever I want and that I should use the card to make sure its working well. So she said when we go to the bigger mall, you can buy ""whatever"" ""you like"" there. Then I grab what I like and Im shamed for it. She also pushed me to give her signage on my credit card so she can use it on my behalf. Like I have any choice to decline. I don't even know why I have that card, I can't use it and I eventually gave it to her and said keep it, not like I'll ever use it. She got pissed. She then said when we got to the smaller mall then you can buy whatever you like. That made my blood boil bexause were were at a huge mall a few days ago which is in a city far from where we live. And for once something I love is in store and I couldn't buy it and now you're telling that exact same shit that I should buy whatever i want from the smaller mall even though I have no business there as that mall doesn't have a book shop selling books I'm interested to buy or even ""toys r us"" for me to buy Wednesday. 

I have been tested so much this past week and on top of that she has been do rude with her attitude and her actions towards me the entire week. After we exited the toy store. I told her ""why don't you ever let me buy something I truly love or like without making me cry or sad or shaming me? "" she said that whatever I love or like in terms of interests or hobbies is weird and useless. She said that ""when you get older,  go buy whatever the hell you want cause I'll never pay for anything you want!!""

The sad part is that I'm a child or son that never really asks for much. I'm usually very quiet and respectful and understanding but when different opportunities come and go. I try to buy something cause I also deserve to be happy. But I guess that doesn't seem to be the case with my parents. I feel sad chase by the time I actually make my own money and work a job which will be in like 5 to 6 years ir even more. Most of the things I love, won't even be in store. Albums are not always going to be there, Wednesday doll won't always be there. The factory only creates a certain amount. Maybe they might reproduce but that liklihood is so low as there's always new things and new albums. Stuff pass. Time passes, stuff leave. I only have one life and when I look back on my life, I get sad that my parents never supported me or respected me or ever took the time to learn about me and understand and respect my interests, hobbies and what makes me happy.

They barely know me well. The deem they know me so well but they fail time and time again. 

Obviously they don't owe me anything. They shame me for wanting to buy these kinds of stuff even at the age of 18. They don't understand that I never really got to live my childhood. When I do or buy things that make me happy. It feels like healing my inner child. Instead of acting my age I will always feel younger mentally and want things that I never got. There are people older than me buying albums but when I do it, it's bad.

Istg, I could never breath or act normal like others all because my parents found fault in me through everything. 

None of my parents are satisfied or proud of me. 
My mother has this thing where she says, she trusts me but then says she doesn't. She has gone so much back and forth with playing around with me that I honestly don't give a fuck if she trusts me or not. Thats her issue and her problem. 

She loves to say to me ""one day you will understand"" ""one day you will have a child who will do this stuff to you""

And I'm like in my head, ""why tf should my child be shy or scared to come talk to me about anything that's bothering them? "" ""why should my child not be able to express themselves in their hobbies and interests? "" why should my child be keeping secrets from me if I'm a good parent that my child can trust?? "". At the end of the day if I had a child and I disagreed with them, we would talk it out in a healthy way. Everything I went through, I will never let my child go through. I will break the toxic cycle of my parents.

Sometimes I look back on my life and think how crazy it is that I'm still breathing and pushing through for better days. I have been through so much that I haven't even listed everything here.

My mother and father are very selfish people, they only think they are right and anyone who thinks otherwise may not speak against them. My mother is embarrassing in general. I would say she complains in public and demands so much from workers. She even went as far as ignoring a police officer while he was talking to her. She likes to always be first in lines. She never understands that one way or another, you will go into the damn plane too. Omfg. 

I'd like to add that I hate how I'm even related to my parents as we are very very different people. It's so bad that I sometimes think it was a absolute mistake that I ended up as their child. I can't even critique them. They can't handle criticism or talk like normal individuals without lashing out

My dad is every unhygienic, he never washes his hands, he goes to the toilet and says, ""I never touched anywhere"" you asshole, you touched youre dick. You disgusting man. I get sick thinking that I used to go hug this man as a kid not knowing that he never washes his hands and gets pissed off if you tell him to wash his hands. 
He itches his ass, he cuts his toe nails on the coffee table. He pops his pimples, 

Thinking about him makes me feel sick because he would always shame me for not liking to be dirty, he would shame me and call me gay cause I hate facial hair, I like to take care of myself. I like to care of my skin and hair and maintain my smell and sweat. I like to be clean. 

I cannot believe I have to be called gay which isn't a bad thing just for taking care of myself. Also I hate that my father never respected my choices or my will to do something. He always forced his ideas on me on what sports to do and in general whatever he thought was best for me. It was like he wanted to live my life for me, 

I'd say that my parents made me hate studying so much that only recently am i trying to fix my relationship with my studies and do it for myself. 

I'm nothing like my parents, and I'm proud to be different. I'm proud of who I am at the end of the day and I'm glad I turned out the way I did. 

I just pray for days when I will be living alone and have better people in my life. 

Sorry for the long rant, I have been debating whether to get on reddit and just let it all out but I'm just so tired and exhausted and mentally drained. They critique and judge me in everyway shape and form. There was even a moment when my mother called me ugly 

I'd love to hear what you all have to say
Am I the bad person?? , I can elaborate more and answer questions below if anyone replies

1go8czr,https://www.reddit.com/r/davidlynch/comments/1go8czr/a_simplistic_interpretation_of_mulholland_drive/,A simplistic interpretation of Mulholland Drive,"Watching the movie creates an overwhelming sense of grief and loss.    People often suggest that there are two different parts of the movie,  from the reality and the dream, comparing the first part and the second.

In my opinion, the only ""real"" part of the movie is the scene where Naiomi Watt's and her ""roommate"" are dealing with the moving boxes.    IMO this is the real  ""Diane""  and ""Rita"" and they are lovers who have broken up and ""Rita""  has moved out and is picking up the last few things.     The KEY is just her giving Diane her old key back.   (Who give who a key and why?)

Diane is basically the waitress at Winkies.  (Notice the clue with coffee cup,  it's the same one from the diner.  Lots of waiters bring stuff home from their restaurant.  )   She came to Hollywood with dreams in her eyes and never made it at all.   All the dreams about the audition the movie set etc  are just fantasies.    She winds up working as a prostitute and gets hooked on drugs.     The ""Hitman""  is just her pimp and dealer.   (That's the meaning of the red lampshades throughout.)    Sometimes she services men behind the dumpster at WInkies and that's what the big shame is.     And the cops looking for her are probably trying to follow up on the shutting down the prostitution ring.   She never ordered a hit on Camilla.

The old people are her grandparents.  They were with her when she first moved to Hollywood.   She was able to use the money her Aunt gave her to move.   The big wad of cash she's showing the Hitman is basically the next amount of inheritance she received when her grandparents died.    She had the opportunity to use it to get her life together and instead she blew it on drugs with her Dealer.

IMO Diane is symbolic of all the dreamers who wind up homeless and addicted to drugs who never even had a chance to make it in Hollywood.    The  reason her grandparents  look so evil to her,  is that if they hadn't died and left her the money she wouldn't have spun out into drugs so quickly.   Their money helped her crash.  She's lost everything so she kills herself.

Everything else in the movie is her state of mind either dreaming or hallucinating in a drugged out state.   Basically the entire movie is her using drugs and passing out in her bed, then  waking up to let her girlfriend get more of her stuff,    passing out on the couch and then getting up and going into her room and shooting herself.",10,1731266157.0,davidlynch,1,1.0,False

Currently, I’m living in Stamford, Connecticut, on a 9-month teaching fellowship, and I’m ready to find someone who’s not only my partner but my best friend. Think of a cozy evening with coffee, shared laughter, and someone who truly *sees* you—that’s the kind of connection I’m after.

**About Me:**  
I’m 5’4” with deep brown eyes that can catch every detail in a room, and medium-length dark brown hair that’s always ready for a good breeze. I have a soft spot for self-expression, which is why you’ll find three tattoos—each meaningful, one on my shoulder (a rose), one on my hand (a bluebird), and one on my forearm (a lilac). I live a balanced, healthy lifestyle—no smoking, no drama, and alcohol only in moderation (because, let’s be real, it’s expensive!).

When I’m not working, you can find me writing, drawing, or immersing myself in synthwave music. My soul is rooted in the past, which means *Gossip Girl* (original series only) is my guilty pleasure, and my top six films include *Dogfight*, *Cruel Intentions*, and *Stand By Me*—there’s something timeless and special about them. If you appreciate that nostalgia, we’ll vibe instantly.

**What I Want:**  
I’m craving something real. A partner who feels like home. Someone who I can laugh with over the silliest things, share quiet moments of affection, and just be completely ourselves around. I want us to build a life where we’re not just lovers but best friends who can weather anything together. If you believe in building a relationship based on trust, genuine connection, and a bit of playful romance, then we’ll get along beautifully.

**About You:**

* **Age:** 28-37, 5'10"" or taller
* **Build:** Slim, fit, or lean (but truly, it’s your energy that matters most)
* **Lifestyle:** Non-smoker, drug-free, and moderate drinking is cool
* **Location:** Connecticut or nearby (US/Canada preferred)
* **Seeking:** A monogamous, long-term relationship with marriage potential
* **Communication:** You’re reliable and know that actions speak louder than words. A good morning or goodnight text goes a long way in showing you care.

If you’re emotionally available, kind-hearted, and ready to create something lasting, I’d love to hear from you. Please include a photo, and I’ll happily share one back if we connect.

This is going to be insanely long and I am sorry about that. I am trying to make sense of a lot of things that I have never said to anyone. I know this is disjointed and hard to follow. I appreciate even just having the space to write this all down.

Because it’s easy to only share things from my perspective, I think it is important to get a few relevant facts and a few of my husband’s frustrations out in the open. Some of these things are just important things to keep in mind to help understand the things that have happened.

1. I am a stay at home mom.

2. I don’t drive.

3. I am terrible with finances.

4. I have always been an absentminded and messy person. You can generally tell how I am doing emotionally by the state of my “personal spaces.” When things are good, spaces are clean with just some clutter here and there. When things are bad, spaces are sometimes downright slovenly.


My husband and I got married because I was pregnant. I really do think we loved each other. I know I loved him very much.

My husband(let’s call him Will) lived with a female roommate when we met. This was a non issue. His roommate was great and I trusted Will completely.

After about a year of dating, Will started lying to me about the dumbest things. He would say he was going to bed and then stay up playing video games with his female roommate. He would sometimes do favors for her or they would stay up and talk. None of this was an issue. I trusted him and I thought this was normal roommate behavior. I just found it weird that he would lie about it.

The lying started to drive a small wedge between us but I didn’t really let that wedge grow because I trusted Will. Sure, he was lying. But the things he was lying about didn’t matter so was it really worth making a big issue about it?

When I got pregnant, we weren’t ready at all. I worked full time, was in school, and relied on public transit to get to everywhere. Will lived about an hour’s drive away from me. When we chose to have the baby and move in together, I asked that we look for a place that was midway between my area and his, so that I could keep my job and stay in school. Will drew a circle on a map and said we couldn’t move outside of a radius of a couple miles from his house. His rationale was that he made the majority of the money and he needed to be close to work. He was the one who had all of the money for first, last, and deposit and he said he would not put money down on an apartment that was any further than the circle. I told him that this would mean I would be spending four plus hours every day on public transit. Will said that it might not even be practical for me to return to a low paying job while having a newborn. I agreed to move inside the circle.

When looking for apartments, Will found out there was a vacancy in his current complex. I wanted to start somewhere fresh, in a location that was new for both of us. I thought we agreed till one day he left me at the house with his roommate and she started selling me on the idea of us moving into their complex. After a few hours of this, she finally broke down and said she had been put up to it by Will. She said she felt like I was being manipulated and didn’t want to be a part of it and she wanted me to know the truth. I confronted Will about it and he lied until I said I would leave if he didn’t come clean. He finally admitted that he put her up to it.

It’s not that I cared that he wanted to advocate for the place he wanted. I just hated that instead of having a conversation with me about what was right for our life, he lied. And he recruited someone else into the lie. This was the first lie that felt like an actual issue.

We ultimately found an apartment and Will had to tell his roommate he was moving out. She wanted him to pay the full current month’s rent, plus two additional months. Will and I felt this was excessive and he pushed back. She still asked for the two additional months. Will told me he would only pay one additional month. But then he paid her the second additional month behind my back and lied about it when confronted.

We entered into a period where he was lying to me a lot. He would lie for seemingly no reason other than to avoid having a discussion with me. I was pregnant and didn’t know what to do and we ended up getting married. I convinced myself that the lies weren’t BAD lies. They were lies I could deal with.

Before giving birth, we had a discussion about who I wanted in the delivery room. We agreed that it would be me, him, and my mother. He asked if his mom could be in the room and I said I would rather not have her there. Honestly, I kind of didn’t even want MY mother there because we were estranged at the time. Will agreed to talk to his mom and told me several times that I did not have to worry about it because he handled it.

I developed preeclampsia and had to be induced early. The whole thing was kind of scary. I was in unmedicated labor for two nights before the nurses started trying to convince me to take the epidural. I finally agreed and as the needle was being inserted, Will tells me that his mother is crying in the lobby and even though we had already discussed it, he just wanted to see if she can come in. At that point I was exhausted, scared, angry, and felt kind of betrayed. I said “fine,” and he went and got her. His mother joined us and was elated. Will spent most of the rest of my time in labor on his phone. I found out later that he was updating his Facebook status to things like, “Keep going, baby! Push! You’re almost there!” and interacting with people in the comments. None of these things were said to me in real life. I would ask him to rub my back through the contractions and he would halfheartedly do it for a few seconds before returning to the couch and his phone.

I lost about half of my blood volume and needed a transfusion. I had to stay in the hospital for three days after giving birth and was told that I would likely need help for several weeks, possibly even a month or more. When we got home, there was almost no help. He had work and made a rule that he couldn’t get up with her at night because that would affect his work. I agreed with this because we couldn’t lose his income. He started to feel like he had to be on duty the second he walked in the door, so he made another rule that he would get an hour to decompress after getting home before I asked him anything.

I was alone in this new city and had a newborn so I felt very stuck during the week. We would run errands together on weekends as a family and when we would get home, I would take the baby and her car seat up the stairs to the apartment to get changed, fed, and into her crib. During that time, my husband would bring the groceries into the house. One day, he stopped bringing them into the house and left them on the halfway point of the stairs outside. He said he felt it wasn’t fair that he had to take them up alone. So he started taking them halfway and I would bring them the rest of the way. Eventually, this felt embarrassing and inconsiderate of our neighbors so I told him to leave the groceries in the car and I would just bring them all the way up myself after feeding and putting down the baby. I know this seems small but I feel like it is relevant to know how petty he gets when he feels like he is doing more than his share. Even if that feeling isn’t based in anything true.

During this time, he’s still lying to me about dumb stuff. Saying he didn’t go to Jack in the Box. Lying about going to a coffee shop with his friends. Lying about things that make no sense to lie about. The lies and isolation hit me hard and I developed pretty severe postpartum depression. I feel like I have to say that I have never felt suicidal before this and have never felt suicidal since. But I felt suicidal then and I told him about it. He told me to sleep on it and literally never brought it up again.

(I’m going to jump a few years to say that I eventually talked to Will about how it felt to know that I could tell him I wanted to die and he never checked back in to ask if I was okay. We argued about this for months and he eventually bought me a giant Mrs. Field’s cookie with the words, “Are you okay?” written on it. Lol. No, he didn’t also ask me to my face and no, we never talked about it.)

As I struggled through postpartum, I finally reached out to a friend and started talking to her about it. Will found me in the closet, crying on the phone and asked me what was happening. I wrapped up the phone call and told him that I just needed someone to help me. He then told me that saying things like this to friends would change the way people looked at him. Once you cause your friends to look at your spouse negatively, you can’t take it back. He told me that we should talk to each other and not let people’s opinions into our relationship in ways that could hurt us. He told me his uncle taught him that you can pick a trusted family member of the same sex and discuss it with them, but letting friends into your problems will destroy your marriage. I was dumb as fuck so that made sense to me.

This is already so long and we aren’t even at the real problems. I am going to have to go through this faster. Things continue going on pretty much the same for about eight years.

Will started making more money and becoming more well known in his field. He worked on several big movies before getting on the project that really changed his career and our lives. He went from making semi-okay money and being relatively unknown to making good money and being very well known in his industry. He still lied during this time. At this point, it’s a feature of Will. He works and he lies about things.

Once Will started making good money, he expected me to know how to manage it. When we were broke, we were both involved with the finances and jointly knew nothing and fucked up together. But when he started making good money, he expected me to manage it alone. I should have learned how to do this. I didn’t. I made sure things were paid and that my daughter had everything she needed. When he was on a movie, we could generally stockpile 12k in a couple months without even needing to really cut back. But then the movie would end and he would be off for three months. We would spend that 12k and sometimes go into debt. Then he would get on a movie and we would spend a few weeks/a month getting out of debt and stockpiling 12k again. I didn’t know how to manage finances when I couldn’t anticipate what was coming in. I should have sought outside help but I didn’t see it as a problem till far too late.

Once we started to realize that our finances were wildly mismanaged, we started to set soft budgets. We would set a target amount to go into long term savings and a certain amount to go into savings that would be used after the current job ended. Then we would figure out how much was left for discretionary spending. Will would often spend almost all of the discretionary money without discussing it. But he still expected both savings pots to be funded as normal. There were also weeks when we agreed on the way to spend the discretionary money and he would also buy something for himself, forcing me to either have to transfer money out of savings to cover bills or allow them to lapse and pay them later. Will would get very upset when money was transferred from savings, regardless of whether or not it he spent the discretionary money or even dipped into the money for that week’s bills. Savings was on autotransfer if funds got low  and I would make sure there was enough money in checking for the bills. So there would be times when he would spend money on something like tickets and clothes for an event and then get pissed at me when “my” transactions caused the auto-transfers later in the week.

Me not driving cost us a lot of money. My daughter was in an expensive sport that had long practices  almost daily and I used Uber/lift to get us there and anywhere else we needed to go. At one point, we were spending close to 1k/month on Uber alone. I don’t blame my choice to not learn to drive on anyone. I don’t even know why I haven’t. I don’t think I can answer it honestly, even to myself. I think fear and shame is some of it. I don’t feel afraid of driving but I do feel afraid of being bad at it and hurting someone. I’m afraid of my incompetence causing harm to someone else that I can’t take back. But I don’t even think that is the full, real answer. All I do know is that I have had years of opportunity and I have not done it. And this choice cost us a lot of money.

I settled into a lot of bad choices. I got tired of fighting about the way his attitude felt like, “Budgets for thee and not for me!” If he didn’t want us to pinch pennies together, then I just wouldn’t pinch pennies either. He was lying to me and was rarely home and I think the truth of it is that living comfortably made that feel okay. Or, maybe not okay but livable. I kind of told myself that I didn’t need to fight about where my husband was or what he was lying about because my daughter had this amazing life and I could be happy with that. Me being dumb as fuck is a running theme here. I recognize that my own stupidity is maybe even the main problem in all of this.

And then comes Pablo.

Pablo(name changed) is a person who worked in pretty much the same field as my husband. He was one of the more famous guys in this industry and had a huge amount of followers on Instagram(something my husband now noticed and talked about). Pablo was athletic. He was single. And he became Will’s best friend.

From the moment Will and Pablo became friends, Will’s attitude toward me changed. It used to feel like we were working things out but I was angry that he kept lying to me. This switched to feeling like Will had this rage that was always bubbling under the surface and would explode during moments of stress. There was one Christmas when I asked him if we could take the money we would normally spend on gifts and use it for a small trip to San Diego. My daughter couldn’t list a single physical thing she wanted that year and only asked to stay in a hotel. When I brought this up to will, he lost it. He screamed, “With what money?? With what money??” and literally backed me into a corner while screaming into my face. Seeing it typed out makes it seem much more reasonable than it felt in the moment. He’s not tall but I am quite short and he was towering over me as I tried to shrink into a corner while he was screaming directly into my face. It seems tame when typed out, but it didn’t feel that way in real life. He told me that I was nothing but a nanny and he could hire a nanny to replace me. I told him that I could just take our daughter to spend Christmas in Vegas with my mom and he said he wouldn’t pay for it.

I want to make it clear how much Will bought for himself during this period of time. Before Christmas, he personally bought himself hundreds of dollars worth of items that cost way more than the SD trip I planned. I admit that I spent a lot of money on Uber and wanted my daughter to be comfortable and have the things she wanted and needed. But ridiculous spending was not a one way street that would make this blow up at me warranted. And, for the record, the Christmas gifts we ultimately bought(agreed upon by him) would have also covered the cost of the trip.

After, I tried to talk about how this altercation scared me. Will would have none of it. He mocked me for being scared and told me that I was trying to make him feel like he was abusive. He would only agree to discuss the situation if I was willing to talk about how I pushed him to that point. I was unwilling to talk about it that way because my entire point was that his reaction should have never been an option. My fear was that this was a point that he COULD be pushed to. In order to feel safe, I needed to know that would never happen again. He refused to talk about it further.

During this time, he was working on the biggest movie of his life. It was a big deal and he found himself going to award shows, doing interviews, and getting invited into rooms that he never thought he would be in. He would invite me to go with him and I just… couldn’t. I am not particularly social by nature but it also felt impossible to stand by someone who I was starting to feel treated me poorly behind closed doors. I know that some people will feel I am overreacting but that altercation felt violent and it was messing with my mind.

Will started feeling angry that I was “abandoning” him when he was finally reaping the rewards of all the years of work he had put into his craft. I felt like I couldn’t stand by him and have people tell me how great he is and how lucky I am to have him when I didn’t feel that way. His refusal to talk about what happened made me feel silenced and standing by him made me feel complicit in that silencing.

I am sorry this is so long. I am trying to condense.

My husband got our daughter an iPad and used his AppleID to set it up. I was sitting with her one day and a semi-naked photo of a woman comes through. It was from Pablo.

I open the messages and see that Pablo is bragging about this woman to my husband and sending photos of her cooking for him. Over the course of several days, I see that Pablo talks about women extensively to my husband. There were detailed accounts of sexual encounters, rating/ranking women, sending photos to my husband that appeared to have been meant solely for Pablo’s eyes. Once, Pablo even described events that ultimately amounted to stalking a woman and showing up at her apartment unannounced. My husband told him that “she knows she misses that dick.” No condemnation. No push back. I hate even typing this out.

I also found out that Pablo had been either fired or forced out of an adjacent industry because of things that happened in relationships with his colleagues. There was a forum online where Pablo was being discussed as a predator and my husband told Pablo that “the white guys were just jealous they can’t compete with your black dick.”

Will is weirdly obsessed with Pablo’s dick. I have never seen anyone else say shit like that.

When Pablo started sending my husband photos that seemed like they were meant just for Pablo’s eyes, I felt it was necessary to tell Will that I had seen them. I told him that, as a woman, sending intimate photos to a  person who was not the intended recipient was a huge breach of trust. I told him that I realized that this wasn’t a conversation I was supposed to be privy to but that his reaction felt disappointing. No one was standing up for those women and telling Pablo to stop. I told him that the things he said were gross and I expected better of him as a married man.

He lost his SHIT. He told me I didn’t want him to have friends, that I was trying to make him look bad, that this is just how guys talk. He latched on the word “gross” and will randomly remind me of how I called him gross, even to this day. I stand by it. It was gross and weird.

This is getting far too long so I’m just going to say that this continues for two-ish years. Pablo does weird shit, my husband co-signs, I protest, he blows up and blames me. They are weird-ass best friends against the world. In an industry of mostly women, mind you. During the fucking Me-too movement.

One day, my husband comes to me and tells me he needs to say something. He says that I have always had great intuition and he should have trusted me. He said that there is a woman who has created an instagram page dedicated to exposing Pablo. Apparently she and other women were uniting because of their experience with Pablo. These women had been stalked, bullied, and threatened with the release of their intimate photos. My husband acted gobsmacked. Why? I don’t know. They literally just wrote down the shit we already knew years ago. But he was pretend gobsmacked and I heard him out. He said he should have listened to me and that it is news to him that Pablo is a bad person. But then he also told me that the woman who started the page is a crazy 22 year old who is doing this to be malicious. That seemed like weird information to know, so I asked him if he had spoken to her. He was like, “no! I would never! That’s crazy.” I accepted that for a while but my gut kept gnawing at me. I told him that I was sorry to ask again but my intuition has never failed me and it was calling bullshit. He looked me in my eye and told me he never spoke to her. He told me how this is probably just a residual feeling that comes from the lies he has told in the past. He told me that even though he picks up the weight of that burden every day, it is hard on him to know I don’t trust him when he is telling the truth. He told me that it is probably even harder because my father wasn’t in my life.

Two days later, the girl makes a post calling my husband out for continuing to contact her and threaten her with legal action. Lol. So not only was he calling her, he was trying to silence her, too.

When I brought this up to Will, he said that he only god involved because she is pretending to be a victim and she didn’t really feel taken advantage of, she was just trying to get revenge. She, the 22 year old young woman, was trying to vilify him, the 40 year old married man with all the industry contacts and good reputation. He would only agree to talk about it if we talked about how blindsided he was and how shocked he must be to find out his friend is trash. It was so crazy to watch something major happen to you and others and to have that reality completely denied. The person I needed to discuss this with would only discuss it with me if we talked about it as though the way it happened wasn’t the way it happened. Wild.

He would also tell me he didn’t have time to discuss any of this with me but would then be in Zooms with other industry people talking about what a betrayal this is and how he was as shocked as they were. Fucking HOW? My husband was pretty much the one person who DID know. And the stupid piety he had afterward was unbearable. There was an event he was going to and he wanted to wear his Time’s Up pin and asked me to help clip it to his lapel. I wanted to stab him with it.

I don’t know why this broke me as much as it did. Something inside of me just gave up. I stopped leaving the house. I became a full recluse. I became so afraid of seeing anyone we jointly knew. My husband knew all of this ahead of time. So did I. Neither of us said shit. I didn’t track those women down on socials and let them know what was being said and shared about them. I just rolled over and let it all happen. Will was getting these messages two years prior to when all of this came out publicly. That was two years of trauma that might not have happened to someone if either of us had said something. But we didn’t and now Will’s pontificating on the internet so that people will tell him how great he is.

I started getting heart palpitations that were ultimately diagnosed as panic attacks. I would be sitting in a room and all of a sudden my heart rate would shoot up to 155 bpm on my Fitbit. I started gaining a crazy amount of weight due to inactivity.
I only left the house when absolutely necessary.

We were driving to visit my family for Thanksgiving later that year and it rained the whole day. We were driving faster than I felt was safe, so I asked Will to slow down. He snapped at me about being the one who knew how to drive. He increased his speed after a while and I had to weigh the benefit of saying something again. I knew Will had only sped up to spite me for saying something to begin with. Saying something again might get him to slow, but it also could cause him to lash out more. But I was getting freaked out so I said something. He snipped at me again about not knowing how to drive and continued at an unsafe pace. He took one hand off the wheel and started tapping out a beat. It felt like he was trying to be petty. We hit a puddle of water, slid, hit the center divide, then spun out on the freeway. Thankfully, we were all okay. Bystanders helped us get to the side of the road and everything ended up alright.

It terrifies me that I know we got into an accident because he wanted to punish me. It terrifies me that I can’t prove it. It terrifies me that my daughter was in the car. I am disgusted that I should have taken action that day, and I haven’t. I am disgusted that all I have done is make sure she doesn’t ride long distances with him anymore. And if we have to, I use the “sanitized by light” approach of having someone on the phone because he doesn’t pull shit like that when people are around to see it. I have become so ineffective and incompetent and dependent. Leaving the house feels hard. Talking to a stranger feels hard. I am a shell of the person I used to be and when I look back at the things that happened, I don’t think anyone would think it was that bad. I don’t know why I have been completely immobilized by a relationship that doesn’t even look that bad when you write it out.

My husband asked for us to not discuss the relationship with others, but I found out he had been discussing me all along. He would take pictures and video of rooms and spaces I allowed to get filthy so that people will understand what he has to deal with. He talked about our dissolving relationship with female coworkers and pretended I was trying to stop him from getting support when I felt betrayed. I’m not the one who made that rule. He was. I was just shocked to find out I was the only one expected to actually do it. He talked about me to others the entire time.

I’m not even really seeking advice about the relationship. I feel like I am struggling to understand what even happened here. Is this normal? Are these fights the type of things people just go through in a marriage? Am I making these things bigger than they need to be? Why do these feel like major blows when it doesn’t even seem that bad on paper?

My uncle got cancer many years ago and we were eventually told it was terminal. We went to thanksgiving with them a few months after getting that news and had a good time. The topic of my grandmother’s housekeeping came up and led to all of us discussing whether we personally want to keep an immaculate home. I said that I didn’t feel like everything needed to be pristine, others shared their views, and we all moved on. After, Will told me that my uncle pulled him to the side and asked, “What was up with that?” He told me that my uncle told him that he needed to nip this in the bud because it was a slippery slope. He said that my uncle was disappointed to hear I didn’t prioritize keeping things neat.

This immediately sounded like bullshit. My uncle didn’t give AF about stuff like that. My aunt didn’t keep THEIR house in pristine condition. His own kids and THEIR wives didn’t live like that. But for some reason, he pulled my husband to the side and said he was disappointed in ME? Will lied about it when confronted and then continued lying until I said we would just have to call my uncle to confirm. He then admitted he lied and said that he had been pushed to a breaking point and was looking for backup anywhere we could find it. From that point, he would only engage in conversation about this if I would discuss it the ways I pushed him to that point.

My uncle died a few years later and I told Will over the phone because he was out. When he got home, he went straight into Zoom meetings. After, he told me that a friend was having a rough day with work and he was going to sit on the porch and talk with him(Covid). When his friend left, my husband texted to let me know he would be going on a drive to clear his head. I later texted him to say that it was disappointing to know that a family member could die and he still won’t do anything to support me. He gave a halfhearted apology and then blamed me for it. From that point, he refused to talk about it if we did not talk about the ways I make it impossible to support me.

Earlier this year, I was trying to get him to understand why I feel so afraid of him. I tried to get him to understand that I never know where the line is with him. He will cross lines of decency and then blame me for it and that scares me. I tried to explain to him that if he will lie to me about my terminally ill uncle being disappointed in me, what won’t he lie about? He then told me that ACTUALLY, my uncle had said all of those things and even MORE things that he didn’t bring up because he didn’t want to hurt my feelings. He said that he only retracted his statement because he didn’t want to get my uncle in trouble. This was complete bullshit. I got off the phone and didn’t know what to do. I was married to a man who would double down on lies about my dead uncle, to gain absolutely nothing.

We were arguing one day and he told me that if anyone heard about the things that have happened between us, no one would believe me. I told him that this felt like a threat and he immediately wanted me to know that he wasn’t trying to threaten me. But that is what is so scary. I know it wasn’t a threat. It’s a fact. No one would believe me. It’s just true.

I don’t even know what I am asking or why I typed all of this out. I thought I would re-read it and know why I feel like I have been run over by a truck but it all seems so small when it is written out. I don’t know what to do, I can’t seem to get myself off the floor, I feel like I have been beaten up and he has never laid a finger on me. It’s just many, many instances like the ones I have described. I don’t know why the cumulative effect has been so hard for me to deal with personally. I am terrified of him and I know he would never strike me. Has anyone ever been in a situation like this and allowed yourself to become ineffective as a result? What steps did you take to start feeling competent again? I feel like I don’t even know where to begin detangling what my life has become.

TLDR: After being lied to for years about things of varying importance, I have grown depressed, anxious, and reclusive. Seeking help from people who have become immobilized by bad relationships and have found ways to feel competent again.",5,1731265579.0,abusiverelationships,4,1.0,False

I usually drop my boyfriend off at work and head to 7-11 to grab my daily slurpee(I don't drink coffee lol). I live in Canada I'm not sure it's relevant but I do know our laws are different. Anyways, a few weeks ago now I dropped my boyfriend off at work around 10 a.m. and went to 7-11 across the other side of my small city. Go inside, there's a homeless man inside alongside a few others minding their own business so I continue on. I checkout, grab a scratch off lottery ticket, and leave. I notice one of the homeless men I noticed inside now outside to my left. I parked a little ways away from the entrance. He asked me for money I usually just ignore but I said ""no I don't have cash"" as I walked towards my truck. I could sorta hear rustling behind me but genuinely didn't think anything of it. I unlocked my doors, and hopped inside as I closed my door I noticed my passenger door open beside me. He starts asking me for a ride (I go into freeze mode in these types of situations) I looked like a deer in the headlights I'm sure of it. I'm just yelling ""no! Get out!"" ""No!"" ""What the fuck!?"" And so on. While he's going on asking for a ride because he's cold and not trying to scare me. Keep in mind, it's a gas station. There were plenty of grown men around who he could've asked. He finally does shut the door and grunts while muttering something I don't remember. I locked my doors(which I usually do to avoid something like this but I didn't even have the time to do so.) I was hysterically crying for about 5-7 minutes before calling my boyfriend. He rushed over and called police. He has/had many warrants out for his arrest but idk what happened to him. I'm truly traumatized by this experience I never thought anything remotely like this would happen to me.

1go7zid,https://www.reddit.com/r/MM_RomanceBooks/comments/1go7zid/mc_masculine_couple/,MC Masculine couple ,"Hello wonderful people, 

I’m basically just looking for a book with a masculine couple. Example books I’ve liked;

- All books of the special series by Aleksandr Voinov
- Return of investment by Aleksandr voinov
- Starfish and coffee by Keele moon
- Given the circumstances by Brad Reve
- Fair chance (whole series)  by Josh lanyon(one of the very few books I like by her)
- Six degrees of separation by Taylor v Donavon (was not really a fan of the crime plot, but loved the MC’s, and I can’t wait for the 3rd book coming out May 2025)
- While my wife’s away by James Lear 
- More heat than the sun by John Wiltshire 
- Bro and the beast LC Davies 
-  Fate Emma Jaye - this was recommended to me here on Reddit, hands down one of the best mm books I’ve read this year. Can’t wait for book 3
- Exhale Joel Abernathy 
- Sailing deep Noah Harris
- Criminal intentions by Cole Mccade (the crime wasn’t good so I skimmed, but I really liked the characters)

Books I don’t like are usually from these authors (I’ve tried them and it’s a big miss for me when it comes to their books):

- Sarina Bowen - although I will admit I liked understatement of the year. But that’s the only one. 
- Ella frank 
- brook Blaine 
- Riley hart
- A.E via 
- Eden Finley 
- C.E. Ricci
- Alessandra hazard 
- Nyla K
- Tal Bauer 

There are more, but I’m not going to list them. They are usually the popular ones. 

They can either be Best friends, co workers, strangers, I don’t really mind.

My yes’s

- Masculine pairing 
- I don’t mind age gap
- Verse/ strict top bottom - I don’t mind, but do let me know if book is strict or non strict 
- Amazing plot 
- Great characterisation 
- Similar in body type and I don’t mind height difference or if they are same height 
- MMF to MM - guy in the straight relationship being mostly the top. 
- Realistic 


My big no’s are;

- sports romances ( I love American football, but it’s sometimes really clear that these authors don’t watch it except Brad reve hence why given the circumstances is one of my faves) - if you do recommend a sports romance that’s ok, I just hope it’s clear they understand the sports. I don’t watch hockey, so if you recommend that - I’ll be none the wiser anyways. 
- Non masculine pairing 
- Lack of common sense in the writing and characters 
- Where I have to to suspend disbelief 
- Crime books - I know I listed some books that are crime books as my fav but usually 99% within the mm romance genre are not very good (I.e. cut and run) 
- too much focus on MC’s family, I would rather focus be on them or their friends.
- BDSM - I didn’t even know what this was before MM, but a hard no from me. 

Also, bonus if you can recommend me a MMF to MM with the guy in the straight relationship being primarily the top. A lot of these MMF to MM books have the guy in the straight relationship as the bottom and I don’t know why to be honest. But please let me know if you have book recs.

I’m very picky unfortunately 😔which makes it so difficult for me to enjoy the mm romance genre. I’m really hoping to find something here on Reddit. 

Thank you so much for your time.

Love the Riverwest neighborhood because of the walkability to bars and coffee shops and the supportive community vibe.

I'm not from the area and curious if anyone has insight to why there is such a price difference between Riverwest and Harambee, even if a house is located just 1-2 blocks west of Riverwest in the Harambee neighborhood.

For example, there is a [3 br/3 bath, 1673 sq feet](https://www.redfin.com/WI/Milwaukee/3048-N-Fratney-St-53212/home/90213809) \+ garage and basement located at N Fratney St at Burleigh listed for $290K.

This is just one example, but there are many. Would it be a bad move to move one or two blocks west of Riverwest for a better home price? Why is there such a big difference? The walkability is negligible at that point, and we don't need to be near certain schools. Thank you for the insight!",8,1731265049.0,milwaukee,17,0.75,False

Pretty early on I was singled out by my team, so early on I was kinda on my own from then. Which lead me to spend time with my director. He and I got pretty close over the four years. 

He was just always expecting maturity out of me. And he knew I'd do anything to make him proud of me. But he took away a lot of high school life from me. He'd guilt me into not going, and if that didn't work threaten to take a performance away. He embarrassed me in front of the team. He let the team/staff be mean to me. Definetly never had a sick day, even when I had pneumonia. 

I didn't even realize how high his expectations for me were until one of the girls called him out for yelling at me for my anxiety attacks. (most of which were caused by his expectations). We were in a public area with other competitors. 

My favorite teacher, who I frequently vented to, pleaded with me to quit. Even my teachers who hated the band director, asked me to consider if this was worth it. But even if I wanted to, in my head I'd hear him say ""You'll never be anything without this.""

There were good days, he'd throw me a snack when I was hungry. I had extra time in the gym or band hall to practice. I kinda was allowed to do more. He always allowed me to do the best chores. When I had first period off senior year, he'd let me sleep or he'd bring my coffee. He was always a text away. I even got know his kids. Best of all, he would say I was the perfect example and he was proud of me. 

When I graduated, it ended. I had a hard time coping with all of it. It wasn't until years later I finally opened up to my therapist about why I still want his validation, that she named it. It was hard to accept. As cruel as it sounds, knowing EA can happen from teachers, other people have experienced it, makes it real. ",1,1731265008.0,emotionalabuse,0,0.99,False

Phoebe's quirky, experimental spirit shines through her hairstyle — two braids on either side, held together by a choker necklace. She embodies the bohemian vibe with her outfit in the next scene: a vibrant magenta top paired with a multicolored skirt adorned with pops of yellow, reminiscent of traditional Indian patterns. 

Rachel starts with a classic 90s denim overcoat at the coffee shop, blending comfort with style. Later, she wears a light green, fitted top. The high-waisted, dark floral skirt she pairs with it is decorated with deep greens and reds, creating an ""aqua"" theme. Later, Rachel appears in a darling white top with delicate pink floral prints and lace trim, which she pairs with overalls and layers under a blue denim jacket. 

Monica’s style reflects her polished, perfectionist nature. She’s first seen in a sleek black top paired with chic striped pants, a minimalist yet sophisticated look. In the following scene, she adds depth with an enamel vest and accessorizes with a two-layered diamond necklace. 

Meanwhile, Susan is dressed in a light, airy dress with a soft floral print in pale pinks and creams, casting a warm, approachable presence. The fabric is flowy, in muted hues like blush and coral. Cinched at the waist with a dark belt, the dress gains a flattering silhouette. 

The Serious Elements

Underneath the laughter, the episode delves into serious themes like dysfunctional families and personal insecurities. Monica's constant struggle with competitiveness and perfectionism hints at a complex inner world shaped by family expectations. There's a clear divide between Monica and Ross, highlighting unresolved childhood tensions. Chandler’s humour, meanwhile, feels like a cover for his own wounds — he often uses jokes as a shield, offering glimpses of a ""wounded child"" lurking beneath his sarcasm.

One of the episode's standout lines comes from Chandler: “Kissing for us is like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes in.”

He was about ten and was my best friend.

When he first showed signs of illness, we noted he had some fleas. First time ever. He’s watched very carefully and highly cared for. But he was off preventative the last 30-60 days because he began having bad reactions to the medication. He struggled with it on and off throughout his life. In times he was off meds he wouldn’t go to daycare or the dog park, so not sure where it came from. 

The night before he passed, we bathed him and found some fleas on him. Not many - maybe 10-20 max. The next day we were at the emergency vet all day. When we got home we did a pretty standard clean up, but not a lot given just how traumatized we were by it all. We did get rid of most of his stuff that night (his bed, blanket, some toys) but had difficulty just throwing out all of it. 

It’s been a few weeks since and I’ve just noticed a few fleas here or there. Like, 2-3. This led me to getting rid of the rest of his stuff and just a few other standard house cleanings and laundry jobs. I wanted to put a few of his favorites into a memory box but obviously I just can’t. Today I also saw one more. So another round of cleaning. We live in a 600 sq ft apartment with minimal furniture - we have a couch, a bed, a coffee table, a few tv stands and that’s about it. No carpeting of any kind. We have some pillows and plushies around but the place is largely consistently clean. And the dog is no longer here obviously. 

I’m just wondering best course of action here. I’ve done cleanings but not specific to fleas. I’ve never dealt with this before and if I can pay someone to take care of it, that’s not off the table. There’s so few but they are here and haven’t died off, so I’m worried where else they could be….but also because the place is so small I question where they could even be. Just wondering if anyone has any advice. I know we did not jump on it sooner and you can chastise me for that, but really I’ve just never experienced a dog passing and it’s been so sudden and I’ve had tons of vet bills to pay that this was kind of an out of sight out of mind instance.

I don’t drink coffee on a regular basis and see conflicting info around caffeine and migraines. My migraine has been lingering for several days now and I’ve been trying to kill it before the work week starts (even got a really focused massage last night). Wonder if a cup of decaf (20-30 mg caffeine) might help? I also have half caffeine, though caffeine can make me feel a little nauseous.

Also I was curious about some other things…
On a day like today, where it’s primarily lingering and I can only feel it slightly start to make its presence with increasing activity or light exposure, would you treat with pain medication? I did take naproxen, but that hasn’t changed much. At what point would you take it or other pain meds? I’m really trying to prioritize when I take pain meds to avoid MOH…

Also I met with a neurologist for the first time on Tuesday, and she said it probably wasn’t allergies effecting it and that I could skip the daily Zyrtec I had been taking. This makes me a little nervous, but she said it didn’t seem like it was a sinus thing but I thought migraines could be caused by allergies and my mom always had that connection and she is the one who suggested I take Zyrtec. 

Just started nortriptyline a few days ago and counting the days til I get Botox in February

So thought of posting this.  Living and running two businesses in Dubai has given me a unique perspective on dating here. With a city full of diverse people from around the world, meeting new people is natural. Personally, I’ve met many members of the opposite sex without the direct intention to date them, but with a smile and good eye contact, you’d be surprised how often that opens the door for interesting conversations and even dates. Here’s what I’ve learned:

Do’s

1. Smile and Make Eye Contact

This is your first step. A genuine smile can break the ice and put the other person at ease. Eye contact shows confidence, and it’s an easy way to gauge someone’s interest without saying a word.


2. Be Direct, But Respectful

If you’re interested in someone, don’t be afraid to invite them out for coffee or dinner. A simple, ""Hey, I’d love to continue this conversation over a coffee. Would you be interested?"" goes a long way. Being straightforward is appreciated, especially in a city where people value their time.


3. Dress Well and Be Presentable

Dubai is a fashionable city, and first impressions matter. Whether you’re meeting at a fancy restaurant or a casual café, looking your best is a sign of respect for the person you’re meeting.


4. Choose the Right Venue

Pick a place where you both can talk comfortably. Dubai has countless great spots – from beach cafes to rooftop bars. A place with a good vibe can make both of you feel more at ease.


5. Be Honest About Your Intentions

If you’re just looking to meet new people or genuinely interested in dating, make it clear early on. Being upfront avoids confusion and aligns expectations.


6. Listen More Than You Talk

Show genuine interest in the other person. Ask questions about their background, interests, and experiences in Dubai. Active listening can make the conversation flow naturally and create a deeper connection.


Don’ts

1. Don’t Be Overly Aggressive

Approaching someone with too much intensity can be off-putting. A friendly chat is better than coming on too strong. Let the conversation flow naturally without pushing for personal details too soon.


2. Avoid Talking About Money or Business Too Much

Dubai is known for its luxury and business opportunities, but bringing up your wealth or business success in the first conversation can come off as showing off. Keep the conversation light and personal; focus on getting to know each other instead.


3. Don’t Rush Things

Patience is key. Don’t expect an instant connection or push for the next step too soon. Give the person time to get comfortable with you before making a move. If it’s meant to be, things will flow naturally.


4. Don’t Be Distracted

When you’re out with someone, give them your full attention. Avoid constantly checking your phone or looking around. It shows disinterest and can make the other person feel undervalued.


5. Don’t Talk About Exes

This might seem obvious, but it’s a common mistake. Talking about past relationships can make things awkward. Focus on the present and your time together instead of diving into old stories.


6. Don’t Play Games

If you like someone, let them know. The classic “wait three days to text” rule doesn’t apply here. People in Dubai are busy, and wasting time with games can easily turn someone off.


Personal Experience Tips

In my experience, making new friends and meeting potential dates has been a natural byproduct of networking and social gatherings. When I meet someone interesting, I often extend a casual invitation like, “We should grab a coffee sometime,” or, “I know a great spot for lunch, let’s check it out.”

This casual approach works well because it doesn't put pressure on the other person, making them feel comfortable. Over time, I’ve found that building a strong connection with someone starts with the simplest interactions.

Dubai is a dynamic city full of opportunities to meet interesting people, whether you’re looking to date or simply expand your social circle. Keep things light, be confident, and most importantly, be yourself.

Almost every week there's a new variation of ""only an eldest daughter knows how this feels"", ""this album/character/show was written for us eldest daughters"" or ""no-one carries more than an eldest daughter who has to do everything alone"" like girl! Stop! Go to therapy maybe I don't know!

I understand the parentification of daughters exists, because funnily enough I was one myself even though I was the middle child,  and yes, the expectations we place on boys versus girls are way different. Nut I see this kind of stuff so much that it honestly has me rolling my eyes every time I see it. Everything, even enjoying reading and coffee are now ""eldest daughter traits"". I even got into a Twitter fight with someone because I said that having ADHD is actually not exclusive to eldest daughters or even more common in them. Sure it might go under-diagnosed in girls, but I think claiming ADHD is an ""eldest daughter"" thing is proof this has gotten a bit silly.

Not going to lie, I think part of this stems from my younger sister (who has 3 older siblings, 2 of which are girls) insisting she is ""eldest daughter coded"". No girl. You just have anxiety and take care of your friends. Every time I see her insist she is basically the eldest daughter I'm rolling my eyes into my coffee. Doesn't help that her younger sister is only a year younger than her and they're basically twins. 

Someone said it's the new former gifted kid discourse and I'm not going to lie, even as someone who did make being a #BurntOutGiftedKid my personality for a while, I chuckled. Like yes, your position in the sibling order affects how you grow up, but I also think making it your *entire* personality is a bit weird. But it feels at home in this trend of relying on therapyspeak and insisting everything is a symptom. 

As I joked to my friend, ""we cannot all be the eldest daughter jo march academic validation mirrorball girlies it is not scientifically possible"".

Does this annoy anyone else or is it my specific pet peeve? Also this post is not that serious, please don't take it as such. ",0,1731263548.0,family,2,0.5,False

Help?,"I experienced a traumatic event around this time last year. Prior to that, I had been having episodes of diarrhea about once a month with no clear cause (cutting out lactose, coffee, gluten, etc didn't fix). 

Since then my whole body seems to be kind of falling apart and no doctors seem to find this alarming. I have been to three GIs, seen my primary care doctor countless times, and been in therapy throughout. 

Symptoms: 

- Lost 15 lbs quite suddenly and could not put back on
- Diarrhea or loose stool several times/week
- Light-colored stool
- Alternatively, occasional several-day episodes of constipation (usually ending in diarrhea)
- Occasional muscle twitches
- Acne (never had a lot before)
- White spots on fingernails
- Fatigue
- Low mood
- Scalp psoriasis flaring up
- Bruise easily
- Brain fog
- Gas/bloating (also unclear what causes this, no clear trigger foods). Lessened with betaine HCL supplements, but not completely fixed
- Slow motility, feeling of food ""sitting"" in the stomach (take artichoke supplements at night for this occasionally)
- Decreased appetite
- Mild white coating on tongue 
- Yeast infection (never got these before)

I work out regularly. I eat extremely healthy (no fried foods ever, no alcohol, can't really go out to eat much these days, no gluten for a couple months right now just in case that helps). I meditate. I go to therapy. I did seven acupuncture appointments (relaxing but did not seem to have much effect). I take supplements: betaine HCL with meals, zinc, vitamin D, Florastor (lowered to 1 pill/day recently in case that was causing the constipation, but now I'm back to diarrhea), magnesium glycinate sometimes, acidophilus, PHGG for fiber. I tried probiotics (Visbiome - some improvement but not enough to justify the price; Align - caused daily diarrhea; Digestive Advantage - did not seem to do anything). I drink kefir (sometimes fine, sometimes upsets stomach), eat Greek yogurt (same), am trying Bubbie's pickles (fermented probiotic food). 

I am going to have a colonoscopy to rule out Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, but I am getting so frustrated at presenting these symptoms to doctors and receiving blank looks, recommendations to lower stress (this CAUSES almost all my stress!!), and zero ideas about what the origin of my symptoms could be or what other tests I could do.

This morning I woke up without an alarm clock to the sweet sound of silence, made some pancakes and brewed my favorite type of (expensive) coffee, and watered my plants. The weather is beautiful. I have brunch with friends in a couple of hours and then I’m meeting up with a buddy later to 420 it up (which is completely legal where I live) and have adult playtime in the bedroom. Right now I am currently soaking in a bubble bath while sipping more of my coffee. I am debating if I should choose to soak for hours or get out and read a nice book without interruptions.

The purpose of this post? To revel in a glorious day living without children. No Sunday morning cleaning with kids, no Sunday morning grocery shopping/meal prep for kid dietary restrictions, allergies, or tantrums over foods they don’t like. No cramming laundry and fighting for our shared washer/dryer in the apartment complex (which are dominated on Sunday by families anyways). No Sunday sports events for the kids, no forcing kids to do their homework before school this week, no temper tantrums to deal with, no kid messes to clean, the list of positives go on and on. The cherry on top? We have the day off tomorrow in my company, so I can decide later if I want to set an alarm clock and go to bed early or if I want to stay up all night doing nothing. There is something satisfying about having a choice of whether or not to eat fast food at 2 A.M. and have leftovers in the fridge if I don’t finish or not leaving the house at all. Bonus for no kid accommodations, scheduling, dealing with temper tantrums about the fast food and/or child bedtime.

Me and my boyfriend have been together for about 2 years now. He’s in the military and he just got back from his deployment like two days ago, and it was his longest one yet. The first night we spent all day together and it was great. But last night i went out with some of my friends, i wouldn’t usually go out right after we get reunited again but this was planned weeks prior. I left the house at 8 pm and i told him i’d be back around 11, but i reached home at around 12:40. My phone was dead so I couldn’t tell him I’d be home late. I unlocked the door and he was in the kitchen, i started to apologize for being late but I stopped when i saw the kitchen table. It was all set up with candles and flowers, and the dinner he cooked. He even had some music playing on the speaker. He started to say how I didn’t inform him I would be home late and he called me so many times because he was worried sick, I told my him phone died and I wasn’t planning to stay out that late. We went back and forth and we fought.

The fight ended in me going upstairs and he stayed downstairs. I honestly don’t think it usually would’ve escalated into such a huge fight, but the glass of whiskey I saw on the coffee table and the fact that he was probably exhausted contributed to it. After about 30 minutes I went back downstairs and I sat down next to him. He was doing some work on his laptop, and I tried to make small talk which he answered with very blunt responses. Then I asked him if he’s mad at me, which I know was a really stupid thing to ask but I guess i just wanted to make sure. He kind of lost it after that and started saying how he’s obviously mad and it doesn’t take a genius to figure that out.

He told me how it’s only his second night back and I’m already starting with this bullshit. At one point he said how “I’m an irresponsible fucking mess who can’t even remember to charge their damn phone”, and I said at least I’m not drinking at 1 am like an alcoholic. Alcohol is a touchy topic for him because of his alcoholic father, and he’s always so careful to never go overboard when he does rarely drink anyways, so I know it was a really messed up thing to say. He went upstairs after that and we haven’t talked since.

Every Sunday I try to send *Listen to Lisa* a small treat without her asking for one.  I’ve been doing this for years and it’s nothing big, just something small so that she can treat herself to something special if she wants to. Maybe a coffee, a special snack or something else while she’s out shopping. I also feel like it lets her know that I'm thinking about her and that I appreciate her.

I’m asking that all of her Fuckboys, fuck boys in training and newbies alike join me and commit to trying to silently send her a treat every Sunday morning. 

Why a silent send?

I feel like it's more powerful or impactful as a silent send.  When we send her treats silently we’re letting her know that we don’t have an expectation for her to respond, and that she can enjoy our treats and spend the day relaxing. 

It reduces the number of notifications she receives, since we’re not hitting her up on skype, sending proof or anything like that, which will help her have a more relaxing day.  She’ll mostly get those little ‘dings’ as we silently send throughout her day.

Imagine if we all sent her something small as we woke up on Sunday morning and have our first thoughts about Listen to Lisa. She would get random ‘dings’ throughout the day as we send and remind her of all the Fuckboys and fuckboys in training she has.  

Wouldn’t that be hot? Every few minutes, every few hours, randomly all day long.  

‘ding’ a reminder that Puppet4Lisa would do anything for her  
‘ding’ a reminder that Betheball is locked for her  
‘ding’ a reminder that jaffacakey is aching for her  
‘ding’ a reminder that your idle cock is dripping for her

So Fuckboys, fuckboys in training and newbies alike. I’m asking that you join me in participating in Silent Send Sunday.  When you wake up Sunday morning and have your first thoughts about Listen to Lisa. Send her a small treat. The amount doesn’t matter $2, $5, $10, whatever you can afford. All that matters is that you participate and silently send something.  

Let her know that you’re thinking about her ""right now"" and help us make her day feel special by reminding her that she has slaves who care about her and want the best for her. 

Remind yourself why you send to make her happy and remind yourself who owns your idle cock. 

Join me and all the other fbits as we worship together on Sunday morning by sending a silent little treat for our goddess.

An electric socket also tried something similar when I was a kid and threw itself at me holding a fork, three times. I might just have the 9 cat lives perk.

I am a certified tech wizard and can work as personal tech support, I get paid in companionship. Not a fan of drama so I dont cause any, no anger issues here and am an avid meme and random internet bullshit lover. Music makes my brain tingle in the best ways and no matter how bad of a movie I watch, if its with someone special to me that movie is the best thing ever.

Am artistic as hell, used for brainstorming and showing concepts to cause I apparently give good ideas. I do random projects for friends cause why not, so if you want to see an ad for a coffee shop in unreal engine just ask.

I am pretty sure lord of the rings woke up whatever creativity I had in me and I will never forget being that kid in a corner trying to be as quiet as possible while watching the movie.

Playing a game together is always an option, I am good at just about anything I touch and will never be toxic to you. I laugh a lot and will most likely try to make you laugh too and prefer voice calls more than texting. Movies and shows are always an option no matter how weird it is (looking at you ""serbian film"" you bastard).

I probably missed a bunch of things about me but thats the fun part of talking to someone right? :D So come and make one of the best decisions ever.

We live in the USA, and recently, I’ve been facing a lot of racism just because I’m Indian. There have been many incidents where people told her to leave me, saying she’s wasting her “genetic potential” by being with me. People just don’t want us to be together.

One day, we were at a coffee shop, and a random person approached us and asked if we were dating. I replied, “No, we’re just colleagues hanging out.” We actually work together. I could see that hurt her, but she didn’t say anything. We had a short conversation with this person and later she asked for my number, but I didn’t give it to her and told her I have a girlfriend. Now, my girlfriend is angry at me, thinking I didn’t want to admit she’s my girlfriend. But I only said that because I didn’t want to hear things like, “I’m using her,” “I’m wasting her genetics,” or “I’d never get someone like her in my ‘sh*thole’ country.” I’m honestly just tired of hearing things like that. There are good people, too, who wish us the best, but all this negativity is exhausting.

I’ve tried talking to her and explained my side of the story. She says she understands me, but it’s clear she’s still upset with me. So, AITAH for calling my girlfriend my colleague?",0,1731262583.0,AITAH,3,0.43,False

I told him *jokingly* that he has to be the cleanest person on earth, but he told me that it's completely normal... Now I'm wondering, am I dirty or is he overly clean?

He showers a minimum of 2 times a day, sometimes more (he does not have a physically demanding job or do any physically demanding activities) / I shower once every 2 days (I have a physically demanding job)

He only wears a piece of clothing once - puts on a new shirt, pair of pants and pair of socks every morning. He also puts on a new shirt every night before going to bed. (Also washes his coat every week) / I will usually switch my undershirt every day, but reuse my hoodies and work pants for 2-3 days.

He changes his bedding atleast once a week, if he accidently touches his bed without having a fresh shirt on and right out of the shower, he will change the bedding cuz otherwise he feels dirty sleeping in it. / ...I crash on my bed every day when I come home, and change the bedding every like 2-3 weeks.

He fully cleans the toilet every time he uses it, washing and trying the seat, cleaning the inside and closing the lid before flushing so no particles fly out. / I deep clean the toilet once a week.

He washes anything he uses like plates and cups immediately after having used it. / I usually put it aside and clean it all at once in the evening.

He checks and trims his beard and buzz cut every day. / I wash my hair once a week and maybe brush it 3 times a week. I usually just rebraid it in the morning (my hair is 1 meter plus in lenght)

He sweeps every day and vacuums and moops once a week. / I sweep twice a week, vacuum once a month and moop once every 2 months.

I have no idea how often he cleans his shoes and car but I've never seen either anything other than spotless.

If it weren’t for his rare moments of kindness, I think he’d hate me. But one time I spilled my coffee all over my desk, and he went to the men’s restroom to get paper towels to clean my desk. Another time, some classmates wanted to go to the farmers market after class. I didn’t want to go because I was really tired.

Also, If you know the stress of playoff baseball you should definitely write me. 

I’m looking for someone US based. I’m open to distance since we have lovely technology that allows us to have phone calls , and video chats. I want a connection, and to be  best part of each other’s day. We can talk about our day, something that made us smile, and just be there for the good and bad with our lives. 

I know Reddit is a big pool of personals. So if any of this catches your attention feel free to write me!
