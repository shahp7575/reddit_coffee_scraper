I’m a solo traveler here (3 months internship), and I’m on the hunt for a chill weekend market—not just a tourist trap, but a safe, cozy vibe where I can wander and maybe grab a coffee or snack. I’m new-ish to the area and don’t know the city too well yet, so safety is top of mind. Anyone got recs for Saturday or Sunday morning markets around Joburg that are solo-walker friendly?

Thanks for your suggestions !",1,1749888658.0,johannesburg,0,1.0,False

I love him because  he always protected me. Always provided for me. David Truman is what everyone out there would wish to have as a ward or father figure.

I was lonely  when he picked me up from child protective services and became my foster dad.

To others, David Truman was ruthless, coldhearted, and brutal. He kills without mercy. Fires without guilt. Hurts without batting an eye.

You cross his way, he slaughters. But, he’s more brutal, deadly, and violent when it comes to me.

David Truman is also known to be a great womanizer. Rumors had it that he'd taken about four wives. None of them were able to tame him nor handle his brutal side.

Hell, my daddy is one that could make you shiver with just one look. His demeanor  was always cold. He was always detached.

However, women  go horny at the glimpse of him. He's powerfully

built. Handsome like a god…I mean more handsome than any Greek god. He's about six-four. You can imagine how I craned my head whenever I wanted to look at him in my five-four.

All Tabloid  in the whole of America  features him as the most handsome  in the state. All gossip blogs feature how many women crush on him…yeah, my daddy is that swoon-worthy. He’s  hot. Sexy as fuck.

And to cap it all, my daddy came first in Forbes list of the richest men  in America.

That’s  my daddy. Powerful,  handsome, filthy-rich.

And as I read all these about my daddy. As I heard how women moaned whenever  he's brutally  fucking them, I wish it was me. I wanted to witness first hand who my daddy is.

I mean, the man makes me wet. I used to love him as my daddy but everything  changed when I turned eighteen.

My hormones became more pronounced, making me horny as fuck whenever  we were together.

I want my daddy to bed me.

I want my daddy to tease me with his cock. That monster cock of his.

I always finger myself

thinking about him.

I always dry humph my bed imagining his thick shaft stretching me  to the brim.

I want my daddy to want me.

My eighteenth

birthday  wish was for my daddy to fuck me senseless. I want my daddy to focus his attention  on me and avoid all other women.

Fuck! Thoughts about my daddy always sent shivers of need down my pussy.  I want nothing but for him to suckle my nipples, every day. I want his dick to tease my clit.

I want to be a vessel

for his pleasure  and him mine.

I want my daddy to be mine and me his.

I know it won’t  be an  easy  feat because

David Truman  only saw me as his daughter or so I thought. He  only saw me as a kid. He thought I was not old enough to have a sexuality. He thinks I’m the girl he had always protected from his immoral life. But he doesn’t  know I know his secret.

He doesn’t  know I watch him whenever  he dicks women in his bed, grunting at the mad pleasure.

I always watch him fuck them and wish it was me. I want it to be me, hell it’s  driving me crazy.

I’m now a nymphomaniac

just because  of my daddy. I do dirty things just to prepare myself  for the day he'll fuck me. But the man hasn’t batted an eye towards me.

He's overly treating me like I’m still the Vera he picked up from the CPS  from years before. But, only I know I’m not that girl again.

I’m a full grown woman now. A woman who wants sex from the man  she loves. A woman that can endure anything  from the man she loves.

Daddy, please bed me!

I won’t  stop tempting  him until he lost  it and comes to me.

I won’t  stop torturing  him, showing him how my body has grown  over the years until he succumbs and fucks me.

I want my daddy to, tease me.

Suckle on my essence.

Kiss me.

And most of all, make me his!

Yes, I’ll be a temptation  to David Truman.

Thank goodness, his guardianship  over me will end soon. So he'll stop thinking I’m a baby.

My daddy must make his. I must be my David’s woman!

Vera's POV.

“Vera!” Someone calls out to my name amidst the blaring music in the ballroom. I jerk, almost thinking the person I’m waiting for has at long last  arrive  but when I register  the voice as a feminine  one, I scrunch my nose.

It must be my all talkative BFF, Sage.  Tonight is our prom night. I’m a senior. In fact, in the coming months we'll graduate

and this is literally  my last prom in school.

Actually, we the seniors are allowed to bring a date even if they ain’t  from our school and I thought it wise to call the man I want.

I sigh, worried why he isn’t

on his phone nor here yet. I made sure to ring this event like a bell in his ears. It’s  my last prom in high school and I fucking want him here with me.

I whirl around in the direction  of the voice that called me and I see Sage strutting over in her signature cat walk. I take my BFF in. As always, Sage looks pretty. Hot even. Right now, her risqué red sequin dress is showing off her pert  body. She styled her hair in a close-cropped style.

If I’m into  girls, I swear I’ll be among those crushing on her. Sage has lured all the non straight girls in our school and she plays them.

In this our last year in school, she has fucked about six girls in the restroom  without giving a shit about the scandal that followed.

I smile when I notice

the V-neck  of my dress is more deeper than hers and I had worn it to lure one man. I seethe just as I remember

I’ve not heard from him at all.  I wonder where he is. He should be off work by now. A sigh, long enough to attract  attention

leaves my parted lips.

Sage’s  fuck-me louboutin  hammers against  the tiled floor just as she scoots closer to me.

“Girl, you look hot.” She showers me praise as she leans in to kiss my cheeks. I give a smile and peck her back, her soft rosy scent whiff my nostrils.

“Damn, I bet your daddy you got that…” She exclaims with a hint of sarcasm.  Sage will never  stop tagging me a daddy’s  girl because

of David’s  over protectiveness. Sometimes I wish he's doing that because

he loves me as his woman rather than his daughter or ward.

The man doesn’t even relent when I bitch about how I hate his attitude  towards me. He'd always say, ‘Kid, it’s  my duty to  protect you’ and usually  his voice is cold whenever  he says that. Once these words leave his lips, I can’t  argue further.

I swear I hate that about him because  it'll make my plans of him seeing me as a grown woman not to work.

“Sage, stop. Don’t

mock me now. I got the dress by myself. Not David.”  I slap her forearm as I spill it.

I was able to insist on buying the dress days before, if not David would have handled it the way he usually does. That day I hollered that these were my  final moments in  high school and I was old enough to buy a dress for myself  without his help.

Hmm…that man is really strong headed. I  wonder how his workers accommodate  his attitude. There had been many shits in gossip pages that tagged him as the most ruthless CEO in America.

Honestly, I somehow don’t

blame those that call him that. His attitude  can make someone  soil their dress, well except me.

David doesn’t  always come out ruthless or cold hearted to me unless that flare of protection  ripples inside him. He values my safety more than anything  else.

“Really? This is my first freaking  time seeing that. Great improvement  it is.” She quips.

“Sass…” I drawl, taking my eyes around the ballroom  filled with students and their dates.  Sage

does the same too, looking around. “Wait, you came with no date?” I ask and she shrugs.

“You already know how it goes…” She throw up a shoulder.

Yeah, sure I know…someone’s

going to either ask her to be her date or she woos a girl. Sage is an expert in wooing girls.

“Nick isn’t here yet? Where could  he be?” Sage asks me and it’s  then I realize that Nick isn’t  here yet. I’ve been so focused on David, I forgot  about my other BFF.

“I don’t know…I should call him.”  I open my phone and navigate through the contact list in search of Nick.

I dial him but his phone rings without him picking up. “Ain’t  answering,” I say.

Before I turn my attention

back to Sage, the girl has already marched across the room when a sexy chick strut into the ballroom.

The girl’s  blonde hair stands out in the crowd. It’s  so sparkling, it looks unnatural but I know it is because  I’ve heard so much about the girl’s  hair before.

Sage does her usual

thing by engaging the girl in a talk. It isn’t  hard for her to get the girl’s  attention. I cut my eyes away from them and walk over to the corner to help myself with a glass of water.

I want to stay sober and ensure my daddy comes here like I told him. I’d have been drowning in drinks by now…making out around and some shits that help cut my attention  away from him but I can’t.

I just want him here with me.  While I’m sipping the water, I see Nick walk in with a girl in his arms.

See, all my BFFs have a date except me. I raise my phone again and dial David.  He doesn’t  pick.  I can only assume he's shagging one of his whores.

My daddy is a blatant womanizer. I’ve never  seen him with a woman twice, except one person whom he had asserted to be the daughter of his business partner. His four wives all divorced  him because  he couldn’t

be faithful to them. Being faithful is totally  out of the league for him.

My mind always reminds me about that but I love him enough to care.  Since I came of age, my wishes had been  for my daddy to bang my pussy. I crave his love like an addict craves his drugs. The man is cutting through my mind always, driving me crazy. I can’t help it.

I always drip wet whenever I see him bare chested or working out in the gym…

“Vera, darling.” Nick comes to my side and kisses my lips, bringing some moments of distraction. I blush knowing he's doing it in front of his date.

Well, that’s  Nick's way  of greeting me but it’s  as platonic as can be.

“Meet my date, Angelina. You can call her Lina for short.” He tells me, a radiant smile on his face. Turning to Lina, he says. “And Lina, meet my BFF, Vera.”

I stretch out my hand and Lina takes it. “I know her.” She tells Nick as we shake hands.

Everyone in the whole school knows me as David Truman’s ward. Something  I came to despise since I started wanting him to be my partner.

Thankfully, his guardianship

over me will soon end. That parcel of news makes me happy.

“Yeah, of course, you must know her. Vera’s a girl with a big name. Is not Vera?” He directs the last sentence  to me and I shrug.

I practically  walk in David Truman’s  shadow, so whatever  popularity

he gets I get.

“Vera, we’re going to seal off this prom night at my place tonight. You in?” I know what he means.

Nick already mentioned

a pool party at his house and literally everyone in Dame High School will want to attend.

“Nick…I don’t  have a date!” I pout and thrash my feet.

“Darling, there are guys here! You'll definitely get wooed.” He winks by his right-hand side and I see him.

Harry. Damn, the boy wants to add to my list of Dame high school boys I fucked. Orally, mind you. Hell, he’s been on my throat all year round, and right now, he’s drenching me with his eyes.

Well…since the man I invited to be my date hasn’t  shown up yet, I guess Harry will have to stay in his place.

“See…?”  Nick shrieks when Harry starts coming towards us with his jet-black hair dangling with each step he takes. His suit hugs his features perfectly.

Hmm…don’t  get me wrong, Harry is one hell of a handsome high school boy. Literally, every high school girls' dream boyfriend, but he wants a relationship which I only want with David.

I want a man as a boyfriend, not a boy. Especially not the possessive  Harry Yates.

“Hi, Vera.” He says, kissing my knuckles.

“Hi…Harry.” I mutter, plastering a modicum of smile I’m able to piece together. Nick shepherds his date away, mouthing the time we're to live for the pool party and I nod.

“I can see you’re

alone. No date?” He sings out, locking his brown eyes on my features.

I shrug, lightly. Then. “As you can you…” I try to offer a response in return but he quickly spits, interrupting my mind that’s working on providing the best possible answer.

“Why don’t  you accept me, Vera?”  The way he rushed the words comes as a surprise and he surprises me further when he steps into my space, crowding me.

“I told you, I’m Interested in another.” I snap, hating that he always brings this up.  Harry’s eyes dim. He has always wanted to know who in Dame high school wants what he wanted.

Mind you, Harry is a notorious bully. I know he must have messed the person up if he was a high school boy. But, of course, the man I want is way stronger. Harry can never stand up to him.

“Then…can I be your date?” He offers.

The way his lips curl up tells me the dude can suckle on a pussy well. Maybe I can make do with him tonight.

“Fine.” I relent.

At that, Harry drags me gently to the dance floor.  We gyrate our hips together  to the Rihanna  music. I dance away my disappointment.

Harry holds the blades of my hips in a tight grip, shoving me against  his ass to alert me on how hard he is.

When it’s  time for us to depart for the pool party, he comes along. He walks me to my  Lamborghini. Andrei, my bodyguard  gives me the look and I tell him we're heading to a friend’s place.

He flutters the door

open and lets me in. He walks to the driver’s side and takes the wheel, driving  me away.

Of course, I don’t expect him to allow Harry into the car.

Knowing that David missed my last prom night, I fist my hands. He's going to get an earful from me ‘cause I know David Truman is somewhere fucking women.

David's POV.

“So, Charlie consult the marketing  team to handle the marketing of the new designs of the Truman’s  cars.” I rattle off to my assistant as I walk across the hallway to my office.

I just flew back from Arizona and rushed in  for a board meeting. Last night had been  hectic and fun too. My business  associate I went to Arizona to meet  hired women that gave us pleasure after the long hours of talks about business.

I had to rush back to New York  because

of the board meeting and the presentation my assistant  made in regard to the latest design of our cars.

Shit, I forgot to tell Vera about my flight to Arizona it was an emergency, I bet that’s  the reason she's been calling me.

I couldn’t  pick up the call because  I was in the boardroom  when she was calling.  Ah, I’ll call when I calm my  nerves down.

“Okay, sir,” Charlie mutters a response to my instructions. He rushes before me and  flutter my office door open for me to stride in. The boy’s too gentle. I’m sure I’ve told him several times to stop acting like I’m his god.

Having no strength  to counter his actions, I walk into my office. It’s  dark already and the New York city lights filter into my office like a cluster of stars. The glass floor-length windows allow smooth penetration.

Charlie flicks the lights on and walks across the room to the Espresso before handing me a coffee.

“Thank you, Charlie. You should go but don’t  forget what I told about the marketing.” My voice booms. Tired, I run my fingers over my eyelids and huff a breath.

I can manage a massage now. I search my mind on who to call. I’m  still deliberating in that when my door bangs open and Claire walks in.

Her feminine scent first brushes my nostrils, my nerves relaxing knowing one of my toys has come.  I’m already notorious in America for my Casanova  life. It’s  no longer a secret that David Truman fucks anything that has a V between  their legs and two soft globes around their chest.

My life has cost me my marriage  about four times. My first wife found out about my affair with my college girlfriend who was forced into marriage two years before we graduated. Helen swept me off my feet when I first saw her.

She was my first love but I was left heartbroken when my best friend, Nathan showed me images of her wedding photos. Too bad some shit happened and she died…I choose not to remember what went down that night, years back. But a miniature of her is under my roof. Under my care.

My second wife heard a scandal about me and my secretary  which wasn’t  exactly

true. I wasn’t  dicking my secretary  then. I don’t  know who recorded her making advances towards me.

My third… shit, she  had one of my toys walk up to her in a mall and rattle off how she enjoys  my cock dicking her.  Isabel filed for a divorce, saying I shattered her heart.  Then the forth  was the first that cheated on me with one of my associates because  she believed I don’t  give her attention. That I cheated on her from what my associate told her.

I did try my best in giving her attention. Just that I didn’t  meet her expectations in that department.

When I found her getting her pussy whipped by a tiny cock like Dane's, I divorced her.  After my last shit with my fourth wife, I decided  not to marry.

It’s better I fuck around in peace than being tied to one woman.  I wasn’t a man brought up with love that’s why I failed terribly in that sector. Though, Helen was an exception.

My parents never lived together because they weren’t a match. Their union was toxic and that toxicity led to my mother’s  death at a young  age.

I was just eight then. Then I lived with my father. He toughened me up. Lived just the same kind of life I’m living.  He was flourishing then. Truman’s  empire was among the first in the country but when he died and everything was hands-down transferred to me, I notched the empire forward.

Now, Truman empire is known all over the world. I always top the Forbes list. Proudly, I’m every woman’s wet dreams.

My second wife, Anita, is trying to snake back into my life. I know she must have squandered all her alimony because all my exes were paid millions of dollars after our divorce. However, I don’t eat what I already rejected.

Claire’s  voice snaps me out of my thoughts and I smile up at her which she returns. Claire’s  divorced

and her father and I are new business partners.

There’s an asset I’d like to gain from him. That asset will birth billions which I’ll fund my charity organization with.

“Didn’t tell me you’re

back, sweetie.” She purrs, walking to my side. I smirk up at her. Some rumors have it that Claire divorced her multi-millionaire husband because of me.

I never bother to ask because rumors are usually  fake. I can’t believe she can do that. Moreover, it doesn’t  stop me from fucking her whenever  she throws herself  at me.

No matter how  much I fuck women, none of them seem to sate

me. I guess I’m insatiable that’s  why my cock keeps dicking as much pussy as it can.

“It was my father that informed me about your arrival.” She says, sliding across the table to me.

I take in her skimpy dress and fuck…she’s a bit intact.

“Turn around for me,” I order her, and like an obedient girl, she whirls around and shimmy that ass of hers.

My cock jerks alive, loving the way she jiggles those flesh for me. I naughtily smack the flesh of her ass.

I love how she succumbs to my will. I always dominate women, it’s in my nature. I smack her again, and she purrs.

“Get to your knees, Claire.” I command and on a whim, bitch throws herself on her knees, sliding between my legs.

My hard-on is already pressing harshly against my fly. I unzip and palm my cock out, breath hugely leaving me as I free the monster.

Claire’s sigh is apparent. It’s  not my first time ordering her to suck me but she practically

screams whenever  I get myself  free in front of her.

Quickly, she encloses her tiny palms around me and starts to stroke her tongue over my dick before sheathing me with her mouth.

I exhale, fist her hair, and push myself  to the hilt.

“Suck me clean, Claire.” I grunt.  I throw my head back, focusing on the release I want most while she fusses over my cock with her mouth, dragging up and down to my base with her tongue.

“Mmmm…David…” She wails around my cock, the sound reverberating around my thighs and dick as I push into her  mouth, trying to see if I can get the ultimate  release  I want.

Without gusto, I jizz in her mouth.

She jerks in surprise

when I push her away and stand to my feet, my hand running through  my hair.

Sex is fun but I can’t  get the comfort I desperately  desire. The connection.

“Anything amiss?” She asks, wiping my jizz from the corner of her mouth.

I shake my head. “Wait here.” I gesture  for her to grab a seat while I grasp my cell and call Vera again.

Fuck, she doesn’t

pick. She’s  ought to pick. She should be in her room by now.

I tried again, yet no response. Frustrated, I dial Andrei's number. The man is a few years older than me and he was there when I took Vera in. So he's as much her father as I am.

I made Andrei Vera’s personal bodyguard, so he follows her wherever  she decides to go.

Andrei  gets his call on the first ring, his brass voice weaving into my ears. “Boss.”

“Where’s  Vera? She ain’t  picking my calls.” My voice comes out strained, and worried.

“With her friends. In a pool party.” Andrei response uproots anger in me.

He dare allow Vera to stay out until now?

“The fuck? Where is that?”

I bite out, doing all I can to douse my anger.

I can’t allow Vera to risk her life, especially knowing the huge threat lurking around to sink its claws into her. Protecting her is my very first duty. It’s  a promise I made, and whoever wants to come to her will get through me first. That’s

the reason I don’t  always allow her the opportunity  to always go out.

“At Broadway, boss.”

I grab my hands into fists. I try to speak but Andrei beat me to it. “It’s her last prom night today boss. Remember?”

Andrei's words make me stall as I start remembering  Vera’s

words from weeks before.

It’s  her last prom tonight and I’m not there for her. Fuck! I messed up.

Kid’s not gonna be happy. I'll try to appease her in any way I can. I just want her to go home.

I clear my throat and spill into the speaker. “Take her home now, Andrei!”

“Noted, boss.”

At that, he hangs up.

I feel Claire’s  hand skim across my shoulders and she mewl into my ears after kissing the side of my face. “Fuck, David. I’m horny.”

I grin at her, my cock jerks awake as she cups me through my fly.

“Sprawl on the table. Show me that pussy.” And she does it without delay.

Her groin has some streaks of hair that form a straight  line, dipping onto the apex of her pussy lip.  I rip off the wrapper over the condom and shield my cock before reaching for her.

I widen her thighs, and without preamble, I hold my dick and plunge into her pussy.

Fuck! Her hole is too loose. No longer tight. In between stroking her with my manhood, I keep slipping off.

Fuck! Most women I’ve taken are too loose for my liking. I’ve never fucked a tight pussy. Either way, I violently thrust into Claire and she yelps as my dick ravages her wall.

My fingers seize her glaring tits and I squeeze.

“Oh…fuck…fuck…David!!!” She screams begging me to stop but fuck, I’ve not gotten any release.

I thrust, dip, fuck…yet…yet no relief.

Annoyed, I pull out as she jerks on the desk while I start palming my cock…grunting at the process.",1,1749888612.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1lb3hs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1lb3hs8/bride_of_the_cursed_alpha_novel_the_morning_air/,"Bride of the Cursed Alpha novel The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates.","The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.",1,1749888554.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

1lb3hdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyWitch/comments/1lb3hdf/lowenergy_ways_to_work_with_nature/,Low-Energy Ways to Work With Nature,"Whether you're chronically ill, work three jobs, or slept in an extra hour and decide it's a good day to have a lazy day, we all have days or moments where we're low-energy but still want to connect with the elements, spirits, and forces around us.

Here are some low-energy ways to connect & work with nature, categorized by the 4 elements (+ the ether)! Please enjoy and I hope this helps <3

# THE EARTH

1. Open a window or sit outside! Yep. It's that simple. Just watch. Smile. Gaze. It's worth it ;)
2. Watch a documentary or nature-based movie. Even something that's loosely based on defending the earth, or something about plants or ecosystems. There are YouTube pages that make much more interesting documentaries than your typical History channel video, but there's lots of sci-fi & fantasy & adventure movies with similar themes too!
3. Go for a walk... or a nap, by your favorite tree.
4. Learn about a new plant - local or foreign - even just once a week, or once every two weeks! Just look up the picture to see the different colors it can come in, or learn about where its name comes from, or explore spiritual uses and properties. You could slowly build a tiny collection in a cute journal or your notes app if you wanted, one fact for one plant each week!
5. Find photos or art online of nature & mother earth that make you feel good, that resonate with you or make you feel grounded, and use it as your digital wallpapers, profile pictures, etc! Make your signature emoji a flower or tree. Share your favorite witchy artists online! Even just changing the color palette works!
6. Do some virtual window-shopping for earth-themed decor!
7. Do your nails - even if its messy! - earthen-based colors.
8. Sit and breathe in some fresh air. It truly does help.
9. If you have the time, consider getting an insect or domesticated animal as a pet, one where it wouldn't be harmful to look after them or have them indoors with you. There's plenty that can grow on their own, perhaps they just need certain temperatures, clean water, etc. Research the best one for you, and invite a bug friend or critter inside!
10. Wear crystal jewelry! There's no better way to connect with the earth than to care for its children, the crystals and rocks and stones that beautify our world! You don't have to do anything but buy the bracelet or snap on the necklace, some you don't even need to take off to sleep / shower (make sure you research crystal / stone / rock safety for whichever you choose, same with different metals if you get metal jewelry)!

# THE WATERS

1. Drink a glass of water. Literally! Water is life, and we are deeply connected to it - and it is connected to everything! The best way we can connect with it, is to unify ourselves with it.
2. Work with water types! Whether it be floral waters (water with rose petals in it, for example) or dewdrops or rain (after a stormy night), you can observe the waters for divination, utilize it for offerings, etc!
3. It's as easy as dipping your fingers or toes in! Find a river, or pour some faucet water into a bowl, and sit with it. Feel it. Share space together.
4. Take a shower! You don't even need to wash, especially if it's just a random shower in the middle of the day and not part of your showering routine. Different temperature waters can help with different things (hot water for comfort, cold for self-reflection or divination, etc, *can depend on the person*), and you can even start baths if you're more of a bath person. Personally, I like to set a stool outside my bathtub, turn on the hot water, and work on a little project while I let the water hit my back or legs.
5. Things like cleaning up the ocean or beach can take a lot of time and energy, but an equally helpful alternative is returning things to the ocean! Seashells, sand dollars, things you took but weren't gifts - or otherwise found or received - the waters might really enjoy having back. If you can make it to the waters, consider offering these things back. If you can't, even using them with freshwater is sometimes okay - like a seashell to hold your clean sponges, or a sand dollar as decor in your fish tank.
6. Listen to water sounds - whether it be the songs of whales, a peaceful storm, or even just the ocean waves, it really can be peaceful and - if you close your eyes - transport you right to the dry rock on a summer day next to the glimmering streams! I recommend [this video here](https://youtu.be/bn9F19Hi1Lk?si=MbSixIf5dZo9QTjA), if it's for sleep! [This video](https://youtu.be/vPhg6sc1Mk4?si=BGqXsITI5rh8ix1b) is also a recommendation of mine!
7. Shadow work near water! You can reflect, or just journal, take notes, write down prayers... Really, any form of writing or *art* (like water-color painting) near water can really help you connect with the element!
8. Protection with water -- protection practices are super important, but they don't always involve burning incense or throwing salt! It could involve sitting out a cup of water near a lemon you've put by your window.
9. Movement - whether it's just your hands or your whole body, finding a way to move like water - gentle flows, instinctual steps, whatever works to enhance your inner tranquility, focus or general energy work & intentions - can really help! Take inspiration from seaweed - firm on the ground, but still flows with the motions of the waves, like it's gliding through liquid.
10. If you're in an environment that's dry enough for this, and you aren't risking things like molding in your home, having a spray bottle nearby - whether it be of water, or even an ocean-like Febreeze - to just spray into the air is really useful. You can even have fun with it, spraying it above you or walking into it!

# THE FIRES

1. Cook an easy-to-make meal!
2. Sit by the fire. Careful not to inhale too much smoke, or burn yourself! Even just a candle, incense or even just a lighter is useful. (MAKE SURE TO PRACTICE FIRE SAFETY!) Listen to crackles. Talk to it. Dance with it, or sing to it. Practice fire-gazing techniques (like trataka). Additionally, even oil burners (like some aromatherapy tools) can be helpful! I recommend a citrus scent, it's physically healing and citrus is often associated with summer/heat! Burning herbs may also work, depending on the herb or purpose or intentions etc.
3. Fire-based affirmations can really help you connect with the element! Something to get you ""fired up"" or get in touch with the warmth that burns inside you. Even connecting it to your body parts - like being warm-blooded - or culture/religion can be useful!
4. Connect with the sun. Watch the sunset/sunrise, draw a photo of the sun with its gorgeous warm colors (or a painting with a similar palette), pray to or with the sun, schedule your day with the sun's rising and falling hours, collect some sun water, etc!
5. Wear warm colors, or decorate your home with them. Sometimes these colors - like deep reds and cream colors paired together - created a sense of comfort, refuge, or homeliness in your space. They help you feel warm, and foster a sense of snuggling! Additionally, wearing brighter colors can really uplift your mood, boost energy levels, or just overall make you smile - especially if you like those colors! It often feels like a raw expression of yourself, so I recommend giving it a try!
6. This is going to sound crazy - intimacy! It can really boost your connection to fire, especially if your intentions are set to do so! This can also boost manifestation work, just be knowledgeable about this kind of magic before doing so!
7. Holding a warm object - stone, mug of coffee or tea, etc - can help, or even just bundling up in blankets! This is a bit harder as it's not a direct connection but it'll help you focus on connecting with the element.
8. BURN THINGS! Don't do anything dangerous or illegal, but burning paper or an old wedding dress might work if done appropriately ;)
9. Explore fire-based fae, creatures, etc. Whether it be critters that live on volcanoes, or the great phoenixes of many stories and lore, exploring their symbolism, representations, and how they feel or connect to you and your story are all great associations to get in touch with the element!
10. Fire-based visualization: Using light, campfires, flames, phoenixes, or similar imagery in your visualizations can really help with respectfully tapping into the energy or calling it to you, and you don't need any resources or materials to do it! If you struggle with visualization, verbalizing statements of this theme, or thinking other thoughts, work too!

# THE WIND/AIR

1. Fly a kite or blow something (environmentally-friendly and generally safe) into the air! You can also hang something, so that you don't need to physically do anything but watch!
2. Whistling! Singing, humming! Breathing & self-regulation techniques! The air is often associated with communication, so scream! Write! Journal! Exist! Experience! Survive! Live!
3. Open a window and don't mind if it blows some papers!
4. Connect with smoke - like from incense or sage! Uplifting scents really help with this - something light, soft or dainty!
5. Let the wind blow in your hair - and don't mind the mess, it's beautiful and funky and fun!
6. Watching the sky or listening to the wind. It is patient, and the world bustles by - but not just people on the street or water pushing by rocks, it's also daisies and leaves letting loose into the air, and the cold caress of the wind on your jawbone as the night gets cold or the day gets warm.
7. Mindful listening - it really does help! Even if its silence, even if its loud! It helps you feel the air, and space, around you, and really get in touch with yourself, your community, and the element around you at the same time!
8. Bird-watching, cloud-watching, leaf-watching, storm-watching! Whether it be finding creative shapes, admiring beauty, or practicing divination, simply observing is worth the try!
9. Breathe intentions or prayers. Whether it's the classic ""inhale beauty, exhale bullshit"" or simply putting the energy, prayer or intentions of a desire of yours into your breath as you exhale, it's worth it for some people. Some people believe that their god, or their creator, is breath itself - representing life - and so each breath you take is in their creator's name and carries power.
10. Lunar work! Connecting with the moon - an energy in & of itself - is made possible thanks to the atmosphere, thanks to air. Be grateful for all the ways air sneaks into our lives and connects us with one another, and work with other elements in a way that keeps you tied to it.

# THE (A)ETHER (SPIRIT, OR SPIRITUAL WORLD)

1. Explore open spaces. Whether it be crowded or empty, finding a way to resonate with both stillness and movement at the same time can be really powerful. I recommend going somewhere *alive* in one capacity or another - like bustling people, or just strong winds in the grass blades - and just existing with it. Eventually, you can also try meditation, pondering or self-reflection (even as deep as shadow work), or speaking to the nature spirits around you if they're friendly!
2. Energy work, in all honesty, can be very tiring - duh, it takes *energy*. However, even something as simple as calling an energy force to hang out with you, giving a gift or offering, or collecting the paraphernalia of your favorite or most beloved force (such as the ether but others like love, void or divinity too), can really help you connect with the ether in general!
3. Connect with sound energy - like meditative videos, sound healing techniques, or even just music!
4. Learn about spirit communication - you don't even need to start, and offerings or tools are *not* required! Alternatively, learn about different spirits - you could do types like fae and angels, or practices like psychopomp work! This is usually easily accessible somewhere online. You could do some good research, or just talk to others on social media about their beliefs and perspectives and knowledge!
5. Practice being aware of the energy & world around you, as well as yourself!
6. Intuition! Enhance your intuition. This can be done with things like tarot, but to preserve energy, even online ""intuition tests"" or evaluations help - like ones where you see a black and white photo, guess the color of the item it pictures, and then see if you're correct or not!
7. If you're experienced enough, mantra work might be for you! You can learn about it [here](https://isha.sadhguru.org/en/wisdom/article/mantras-benefits).
8. Create an altar - whether it be for a deity/spirit, or just a space for your workings! It really helps centralize energy and get you feeling the vibes!
9. Floating and flying visualization - basically as it sounds! Practice visualizations of floating or flying. Be careful if doing this before sleeping - for some people it helps them drift off peacefully into a good rest, but for others it sparks that feeling of being lifted up and then falling down into your bed (among other similar feelings that may be scary for you). I also don't recommend it if you're sensitive to themes of death or grief. However, even doing it during the day can both be powerful and calming.
10. Get an aura reading! See what color your spirit form is, and what that color may be associated with! You don't have to learn this practice or develop this ability in order to do it, you could easily find someone else - online, even - who can perform this service for you!

ive had to clean up so much after them because they either dont know some things need cleaning, or they just dont care. my boyfriend has cleaned up after them even though ive told him to leave it because of how done i was. there have been unclaimed stains under the couch/minifridge that ive had to deal with. there was mold in the sink and the coffee machine that i dont use which i dealt with too. they keep breaking the chopsticks i bought in the dishwasher (my boyfriend bought me a new set, those broke too). i love them to death because they’re my friends and this behaviour obviously doesnt outweigh the good things theyve done for me, but omg its so frustrating. ive communicated with them several times with minimal improvement, and it seems like the only times they’ll seriously listen is if i bring in some cultural bs (im asian, theyre white) about how its bad luck which sounds a little ridiculous now that im saying it. they have done a deep clean with me once or twice, with the most memorable one being before the lunar new year. 

several days ago they talked about getting a rug for the apartment. now.. a rug is high maintenance, my roommates are spill prone and aren’t good at cleaning up said spills, they also dont clean up crumbs or anything. rugs can also be so expensive. i told them that i dont like rugs because of how hard they are to clean and maintain, and how expensive they are. the only response i got was that rugs can be cheap. 

we have a decent size living space so im assuming the rug they want would be quite large. there’s a chance we move because our landlord is being shady, so at the moment the rug isnt a priority. but if it comes up again im not sure how to say no. (because id be the one cleaning it) 

TLDR: my roommates who are also in my friendgroup want to get a rug but if they do i’d be the one cleaning it because ive dealt with a lot of their messes and spills throughout the year. i fear a rug for this reason. i tried to gently tell them no, but they are very much pro rug. how do i tell them no without crushing their rug dreams?

It’s hilarious how daunting it felt just to enroll, but tbh, once I hit that 'register' button, a weird wave of excitement hit me. It’s like, I’m actually doing something I’ve wanted for so long but always found an excuse to avoid. I guess it's one of those quirks of insecurity that just linger.

I think a big part of overcoming that was realizing I don't have to be perfect, or even good, right away. That's what learning is all about, right? It's all beginners anyway, and I figured the chance to meet some fellow art newbies makes it even more fun.

Ever wandered around a country where the tourist-to-local ratio is practically zero? Not the ""undiscovered"" places your friend brags about (where TripAdvisor already lists 47 hotels), but genuinely untouched spots.

That's Laos for you – Southeast Asia's best-kept secret hiding in plain sight between Thailand and Vietnam.

I've spent five years exploring hidden gems in Laos that most travelers zoom past, places where Google Translate fails and menus remain blissfully photo-free.

These aren't just places to see; they're experiences that rearrange something in your soul. The kind where you find yourself thinking, ""How is nobody else here right now?""

What I'm about to share might ruin these spots forever. Or maybe you'll be the rare traveler who understands why they should stay hidden.

**The best Laos tour packages**

https://preview.redd.it/v1sthn5xju6f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a9c837bef165d07c8ba56440bf9ac2f2146c90

**A. 6 Days Hidden Gems Of Laos And Mekong Serenity**

Looking for the perfect blend of culture and natural beauty? This 6-day package takes you deep into Laos' soul. You'll cruise along the mighty Mekong River, where time seems to slow down and local life unfolds before your eyes. The journey includes stops at traditional villages where locals still practice centuries-old crafts.

What makes this tour special is the overnight stay in Pakbeng, a tiny riverside town rarely featured in standard itineraries. Here, you'll experience authentic Laotian hospitality away from tourist crowds. The tour also includes Luang Prabang's temples and the breathtaking Kuang Si Waterfalls – but you'll see them through a local lens, at times when other tourists have left.

**B. Highlights of Laos**

This compact tour packs Laos' greatest hits into one unforgettable experience. From the spiritual morning alms-giving ceremony in Luang Prabang to the mysterious Plain of Jars in Phonsavan, you'll tick off bucket-list sights while discovering places most travelers miss.

The tour shines in how it balances popular attractions with secret spots. While everyone visits Vientiane, few discover the hidden Buddhist meditation centers or the local noodle shops where government workers grab lunch. Your guide – a Laos native – ensures you experience these insider moments.

**C. 6 Days Discover Lively Laos**

For travelers who crave authentic cultural immersion, this package delivers big time. The itinerary focuses on human connections rather than just sightseeing. You'll participate in a traditional Baci ceremony, where locals tie strings around your wrist for good luck and protection.

The tour ventures into Vang Vieng, once notorious for partying but now reinvented as an ecotourism hub. You'll explore blue lagoons and limestone caves without the crowds, thanks to your guide's knowledge of optimal visiting times. The tour includes a homestay in a Khmu village, where you'll learn to cook traditional dishes and maybe even try rice farming.

**D. The Charm of Laos in 10 Days - Private Tour**

This comprehensive private tour gives you breathing room to truly absorb Laos' magic. With 10 full days, you'll journey from the northern hills of Luang Namtha (where few tourists venture) all the way to the 4,000 Islands region in the south.

What sets this tour apart is customization. Love photography? Your guide will wake you before sunrise to capture monks collecting alms in perfect light. Foodie at heart? They'll arrange private cooking classes with local chefs. The tour includes two days in a remote Akha hill tribe village, where you'll experience daily life unchanged for generations.

**E. Laos Express Train Adventure 5-Day**

This cutting-edge tour incorporates Laos' brand-new high-speed railway (opened in December 2021) with traditional experiences. You'll zoom from Vientiane to Luang Prabang in comfort, then slow down to explore ancient temples and night markets.

The train journey itself offers spectacular views of landscapes inaccessible by road. The tour cleverly combines modern transportation with authentic cultural experiences, including stops at organic coffee plantations in the Bolaven Plateau and artisan workshops in Luang Prabang. Perfect for travelers who want to maximize experiences while minimizing long bus rides.

**What people love about Laos Tours**

**Why Travelers Fall in Love with Laos Tours**

Picture this: you're walking through a morning market in Luang Prabang, the smell of fresh baguettes mixing with tropical fruits, monks in orange robes silently passing by. That's the magic of Laos that keeps travelers coming back.

What makes tours in Laos so special? It's not just about checking boxes on a travel list. People who visit Laos talk about something deeper – a connection they feel with the place and its people.

**The Unhurried Pace**

Unlike its bustling neighbors Thailand and Vietnam, Laos moves at its own rhythm. Tours here aren't rushed affairs where you're herded from one attraction to another. There's time to sit by the Mekong with a Beer Lao, watching the sunset paint the water gold. Locals call it ""Laos PDR"" – not just the official name but jokingly ""Please Don't Rush.""

**Authentic Cultural Immersion**

Many travelers mention how Laos tours feel less commercialized. You'll find yourself invited into homes for a traditional Baci ceremony, learning to weave with village artisans, or helping harvest rice alongside farmers. These aren't staged cultural shows but genuine exchanges.

**Nature That Takes Your Breath Away**

The landscape in Laos is ridiculous (in the best way). From the karst mountains of Vang Vieng to the waterfalls of the Bolaven Plateau, nature here hasn't been tamed. Tours often include trekking through jungles where you'll spot gibbons swinging through trees or bathing in turquoise pools beneath cascading falls. And because tourism infrastructure is still developing, many of these spots remain wonderfully uncrowded.

**The Food (Oh, The Food!)**

Sticky rice, laap, tam mak hoong (papaya salad) – Laos cuisine is a revelation. Food tours have become increasingly popular, with travelers learning to cook traditional dishes using ingredients gathered from local markets.

**What are 10 hidden gems in Laos that offer?**

**What are 10 hidden gems in Laos that offer authentic experiences?**

You won't find these spots in your typical guidebook. From the mystical Tat Lo waterfalls where locals bathe at sunrise to the ancient Buddha Park sculptures hiding in plain sight. Venture to Nong Khiaw's limestone caves or kayak the Nam Ou River without another tourist in sight. These gems reveal Laos as it truly is—magical, untouched, and wonderfully genuine.

**Vientiane: The Charming Capital**

You might be tempted to skip Vientiane on your Laos adventure, but don't. This laid-back capital city by the Mekong River offers a perfect blend of French colonial architecture, Buddhist temples, and authentic street food scenes without the tourist crowds you'd find in Bangkok or Hanoi.

Wake up early and head to Pha That Luang, the golden stupa that's basically the national symbol of Laos. The morning light hitting that gold is something else. Then stroll along the riverside promenade at sunset - grab a Beer Lao, find a spot on the night market, and watch locals doing their aerobics routines (yes, really).

**Luang Prabang: UNESCO Wonder**

If there's one place in Laos that steals everyone's heart, it's Luang Prabang. This UNESCO town sits at the confluence of the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers, surrounded by jungle-covered mountains.

The morning alms ceremony (Tak Bat) is worth setting your alarm for - hundreds of orange-robed monks collecting offerings at dawn. Just watch respectfully from a distance instead of getting all up in their faces with your camera like some tourists do.

Between temple-hopping, cool off at the turquoise Kuang Si Falls just outside town. The three-tiered cascades and natural swimming pools are the perfect escape when the humidity cranks up.

**Plain of Jars: Prehistoric Mystery**

This bizarre archaeological site in Xieng Khouang province features hundreds of massive stone jars scattered across rolling hills. Some are big enough to stand in! Nobody knows exactly why ancient people carved these giant containers, but theories range from funeral urns to rice wine brewing vessels.

**Travel Laos your way**

https://preview.redd.it/szyp3yo6ku6f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6afb32540ecf9759c74e7023dec6ff9f232b055

**Creating Your Perfect Laos Adventure**

Forget cookie-cutter tours and one-size-fits-all itineraries. Laos deserves better than that, and so do you.

The real magic of Laos happens when you craft a journey that speaks to your soul. Maybe you're drawn to the sleepy riverside villages where time seems to stand still. Or perhaps you're itching to trek through mist-covered mountains where few travelers venture.

Here's the thing about Laos – it rewards the curious. The travelers who ask questions. The ones who wander down that unmarked path or accept an invitation to a local ceremony.

I've seen too many visitors rush through Laos, ticking off the major sites like items on a shopping list. They miss the point entirely. This country unfolds slowly, revealing its treasures to those who slow down enough to notice.

**Customizing Your Route**

Mix the classics with the undiscovered. For every Luang Prabang (absolutely worth visiting), add a Kong Lor Cave or a tiny village in Phongsali Province.

Don't overstuff your itinerary. Three weeks is ideal, but even with two weeks, you can experience both the highlights and a few hidden corners if you plan smart.

Consider these combinations:

* Northern route: Luang Prabang → Nong Khiaw → Muang Ngoi → Phongsali
* Southern circuit: Pakse → Champasak → 4000 Islands → Attapeu
* Central exploration: Vientiane → Plain of Jars → Vieng Xai caves → Nam Et-Phou Louey

The perfect Laos trip isn't about seeing everything. It's about experiencing the right things – for you.

**Best tour companies for Laos tours**

**Why Choose a Tour Company for Laos?**

Navigating Laos on your own can be an adventure, but sometimes having local experts guiding you makes all the difference. The right tour company will take you beyond the tourist spots to those genuine hidden gems that only locals know about.

Plus, they handle all the boring stuff - transportation logistics, language barriers, and booking accommodations. You just show up and enjoy.

**Top Tour Companies for Authentic Laos Experiences**

**Green Discovery Laos**

These guys are the OGs of ecotourism in Laos. Family-owned and operating since 1999, they employ local guides who actually grew up in the villages you'll visit. Their signature trekking tours through Nam Ha National Park let you stay with ethnic minority families - something you simply can't arrange on your own.

**White Elephant Adventures**

Don't let the name fool you - this company specializes in small-group adventures (max 8 people) that focus on cultural immersion. Their 7-day ""Hidden Treasures"" tour includes overnight stays in remote villages in Phongsali province that most tourists never reach.

**Backstreet Academy**

Not technically a tour company but more of a platform connecting you directly with local experts. Want to learn traditional textile weaving in Luang Prabang? Or maybe fishing with locals along the Mekong? They'll set you up with real craftspeople, not tourist performances.

**Stray Asia**

Perfect for solo travelers who want flexibility with some structure. Their hop-on-hop-off bus passes let you explore at your own pace while connecting you with other travelers. Their local guides know secret swimming holes and authentic restaurants that aren't in any guidebook.

**Tiger Trail Travel**

A pioneer in community-based tourism, they funnel money directly back to villages. Their ""Beyond the Tourist Trail"" tour includes homestays in Khmu communities and visits to conservation projects you'd never find independently.

**Best places to start your Laos tour**

**Starting Your Laos Adventure Right**

Looking for where to kick off your Laos journey? I've lived here for years and I'm about to spill the beans on the perfect starting points that most tourists completely miss.

**Luang Prabang: The Perfect Introduction**

This UNESCO World Heritage town isn't exactly hidden, but it's the ideal launchpad for first-timers. Wake up early to witness orange-robed monks collecting alms at dawn, then hit Kuang Si Falls before the crowds arrive. The night market here is actually worth your time – skip the tourist trinkets and head to the back alleys where locals sell handmade Hmong textiles at half the price.

**Vientiane: The Underrated Capital**

Many travelers rush through Vientiane, and that's their mistake. This laid-back capital deserves at least three days. Start at Pha That Luang at sunrise when local devotees make their offerings. Then grab a fresh coconut and stroll along the Mekong promenade as the city wakes up. For dinner? Skip the riverfront restaurants and find the unmarked food stalls near Chao Anouvong Park where the noodle soup will change your life.

**Nong Khiaw: The Gateway to Northern Treasures**

Want to dive straight into rural Laos? Begin in Nong Khiaw, a riverside town surrounded by limestone karsts. The 100 Waterfalls Trek starts here – an adventure that takes you through Khmu villages where tourists are still a novelty. Stay in a riverside bungalow for $15 a night and wake up to mist rising from the Nam Ou River. Pure magic.

**Discover Laos tours for every budget**

https://preview.redd.it/b47t7mceku6f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd84338b72c755083fe4eca6e22471de0edbd760

**Affordable Group Tours**

Want to explore Laos without breaking the bank? Group tours are your best friend. These organized adventures typically cover major attractions like Luang Prabang's temples and the stunning Kuang Si Falls, while keeping costs down by sharing transportation and guides.

Most budget-friendly group tours range from $30-50 per day, including basic accommodations, transportation, and some meals. The real magic happens when you chat with fellow travelers – you'll get insider tips you won't find in any guidebook.

Pro tip: Book locally after arriving in Vientiane or Luang Prabang. You'll save at least 30% compared to booking online before your trip.

**Mid-Range Custom Experiences**

If you've got a bit more to spend ($80-150 daily), consider a semi-private tour that balances affordability with personalization. These sweet-spot options let you customize about half your itinerary while maintaining the cost benefits of shared arrangements.

Many mid-range operators include homestays in remote villages like Ban Na or Muang Ngoi, where you'll sleep in traditional wooden homes and share meals with local families. These authentic experiences are worth every kip.

**Luxury Private Journeys**

Got cash to splash? Private tours in Laos offer extraordinary experiences few travelers ever see. Think helicopter rides over the mysterious Plain of Jars, exclusive temple ceremonies with Buddhist monks, or luxury cruises down the Mekong with your own private chef.

Starting around $250 daily and climbing well into the thousands, these bespoke journeys include premium accommodations, private transportation, and personalized itineraries crafted just for you.

The best luxury operators don't just show you Laos – they connect you with local artisans, conservationists, and cultural experts who transform your understanding of this magical country.

**Laos tours for every type of group**

https://preview.redd.it/kxmch3bgku6f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=8956c1c8c6486d968f58a636b97ced3157662ee8

**Laos Tours for Families**

Ever tried traveling with kids in tow? Laos is surprisingly family-friendly if you know where to go. The 3-day Elephant Conservation Tour near Luang Prabang lets your little ones help bathe and feed rescued elephants (without riding them—very important!). My nephew couldn't stop talking about it for months.

For families with teens, the 5-day Mekong Adventure combines kayaking, village homestays, and cooking classes. The pace is relaxed enough that nobody gets cranky, but exciting enough to keep those teen eyes off their phones.

**Tours for Solo Travelers**

Flying solo? The 7-day Northern Laos Explorer connects you with other independent travelers while hitting Luang Prabang, Vang Vieng, and some villages most tourists never see. The local guides make sure nobody feels left out, and the small group size (max 8) means you'll make friends fast.

Women traveling alone might love the Women's Weaving Collective Tour. It's run by female guides and includes meetings with women artisans across northern Laos. Super safe, super inspiring.

**Adventure Group Experiences**

Got a squad that lives for adrenaline? The 4-day Nam Ou River Expedition involves white water rafting, zip-lining, and sleeping in jungle eco-lodges. My brother's bachelor party did this instead of Vegas—way more memorable!

Biking enthusiasts should check out the 6-day Bolaven Plateau Cycling Tour. You'll pedal past waterfalls and coffee plantations, staying in local guesthouses where the owners cook dinner just for your group.

**Luxury Small Group Options**

Not into roughing it? The Mekong Luxury Cruise takes just 12 passengers on a boutique boat with private cabins and a chef who prepares incredible Lao-French fusion. You'll stop at temples and villages but return to air conditioning and cocktails each evening.

The 8-day Laos Heritage Tour includes exclusive access to archaeological sites and private dinners in colonial mansions, with accommodations in the best hotels in each location. Perfect for marking special occasions with close friends.

**Top Laos travel itineraries to fit your plans**



https://preview.redd.it/up8q2urjku6f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=73fc8f40bd2d34620b3253a15711e49f38b32ff9

**Short Trip: 3-5 Days**

Got just a few days to explore Laos? No problem. Focus on either Luang Prabang or Vientiane, but don't try both. You'll just end up spending precious time in transit.

In Luang Prabang, wake up early for the alms-giving ceremony, wander the night market, and take a day trip to Kuang Si Falls. Trust me, those turquoise pools are worth getting up for.

If you pick Vientiane instead, check out Buddha Park (Xieng Khuan), sip Beer Lao at sunset along the Mekong, and visit the COPE Center to understand Laos' untold history.

**Classic Route: 7-10 Days**

With a week or more, you can actually see Laos without rushing. Start in Vientiane for two days, then head north to Vang Vieng. The tubing party scene has calmed down, thankfully, so now you can actually appreciate the stunning karst mountains.

Next, continue to Luang Prabang for three days. This UNESCO town deserves your time. From there, either:

* Head north to Nong Khiaw for authentic village experiences
* Journey south to Phonsavan to see the mysterious Plain of Jars

**Slow Travel: 14+ Days**

This is how Laos should be experienced. The country's unofficial motto is ""please don't rush,"" and locals live by it.

With two weeks or more, follow the classic route but add these gems:

* The 4000 Islands (Si Phan Don) in the south, where the Mekong spreads into countless islands
* The Bolaven Plateau for coffee plantations and waterfalls
* Muang Ngoi, accessible only by boat, for the ultimate disconnect
* The remote Phongsali Province for hill tribe treks few tourists ever see

The slow route means sometimes sitting on a bus for 8 hours on winding mountain roads. But those are the days you'll end up talking to locals, sharing snacks with fellow travelers, and seeing villages most tourists zip past.

**Adventure Path: 10-14 Days**

For adrenaline seekers, Laos delivers. Start with the Thakhek Loop, a 3-4 day motorbike circuit through limestone caves and blue lagoons. Then head to Vang Vieng for rock climbing, kayaking, and caving.

Continue north for trekking in Nam Ha National Protected Area, home to rare wildlife and diverse ethnic communities.

**Demographics**

https://preview.redd.it/l292wjtlku6f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=813d85b84cc0d767a0325d9118e6d12cc1ef2734

**Ethnic Diversity**

Laos might be small, but it's home to a remarkable 49 officially recognized ethnic groups. That's a lot of cultural richness packed into one landlocked country! These groups fall into four main categories:

* **Lao Loum** (lowland Lao): About 60% of the population
* **Lao Theung** (midland Lao): Around 20%
* **Lao Soung** (highland Lao): About 15%
* **Other minorities**: The remaining 5%

Each group has their own traditions, languages, and ways of life. When you're exploring those hidden gems in Laos, you'll notice these differences in everything from architecture to food to clothing.

**Language Landscape**

Walk through any market in Laos and you might hear five different languages in as many minutes. While Lao is the official language, many ethnic groups speak their own languages at home. In tourist areas, you'll find English speakers, especially among younger Laotians. French still lingers from colonial days, particularly among older generations.

**Religion and Beliefs**

Buddhism isn't just a religion in Laos—it's woven into daily life. About 65% of Laotians practice Theravada Buddhism, but that's not the whole story. Many communities blend Buddhist practices with animist beliefs that predate Buddhism's arrival.

In northern villages, you might see spirit houses next to Buddhist temples. In some communities, especially among the Hmong people, animism remains the primary spiritual practice. This spiritual diversity adds another fascinating layer to your adventures off the beaten path in Laos.

**Best time to visit Laos**

https://preview.redd.it/xes71etnku6f1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f6801040e3939e3c08fdc75874549fb23b4dce6

**Dry Season (November to April)**

Laos shines brightest during the dry season. November through February brings cool, comfortable temperatures that hover between 60-75°F (15-24°C) – perfect for exploring those hidden gems without breaking a sweat.

Want to know the absolute sweet spot? December and January. The landscapes are lush but not muddy, the skies stay clear blue for days, and you can actually see those majestic mountain views instead of clouds.

March and April crank up the heat, sometimes pushing 95°F (35°C). The locals call this ""smoky season"" because farmers burn fields for the next planting. Not ideal if you're sensitive to air quality, but the pre-Buddhist New Year (Pi Mai) celebrations in April make up for it with nationwide water fights that'll cool you right off.

**Rainy Season (May to October)**

Don't let a little rain scare you away! May through October brings dramatic skies, vibrant green rice paddies, and way fewer tourists.

The rain typically comes in short, intense afternoon bursts rather than all-day downpours. Morning explorations are usually safe, and you'll get those postcard-perfect misty mountain photos no dry season visitor ever captures.

The biggest perk? Prices drop dramatically. Guesthouses slash rates by 30-50%, and you'll never wait for a table at that hidden local restaurant.

August and September see the heaviest rainfall, with potential for muddy roads in remote areas. But the waterfalls? Absolutely spectacular. Kuang Si Falls near Luang Prabang transforms from pretty to mind-blowing during these months.

**Laos Travel Guide | All You Need to Know**

Look, Laos is that friend who doesn't make a lot of noise but has the most incredible stories to tell. I've spent years exploring its bamboo-laden hills and chatting with monks at sunrise, and I'm still discovering new secrets.

First things first – Laos runs on its own clock. The locals call it ""Laos PDR"" (Please Don't Rush). Embrace it. That boat might leave an hour late, and your guesthouse owner might shrug when you ask for a specific check-out time. It's not inefficiency; it's a different way of seeing time.

Getting around is an adventure itself. Those vintage buses with chickens under the seats? They're how you'll discover villages that Google Maps hasn't even bothered to name yet. And when a local invites you for some sticky rice and jaew bong (chili paste that'll knock your socks off), say yes. Always say yes.

The currency is kip, and you'll feel like a millionaire – literally. Expect to carry around bricks of money since 100,000 kip is about $11. Most places only take cash, especially in those gorgeous remote areas where ATMs are as rare as traffic lights.

Weather-wise, November to February is your sweet spot. Avoid May to September unless you enjoy daily monsoon showers turning dirt roads into mud slides.

Language barrier? Sure, but a smile and pointing skills will get you surprisingly far. Learn ""sabaidee"" (hello) and ""khob chai"" (thank you). Use them generously.

Trust me, Laos isn't just Thailand's quiet neighbor. It's the soul of Southeast Asia that travelers dream about but rarely find.

**Which locally recognized cultural practices in Laos can visitors participate in, and where do they typically take place?**

Laos offers countless ways to dive into its rich cultural tapestry. Baci ceremonies, known locally as ""su kwan,"" welcome visitors in most villages and homestays across the country. This beautiful ritual involves tying white strings around your wrists to keep good spirits close.

Want to get your hands dirty? Try traditional pottery making in Ban Chan village near Luang Prabang, where artisans teach age-old techniques passed down through generations. In the same area, join morning alms-giving (tak bat) at dawn – just buy sticky rice from local vendors and kneel respectfully as monks collect their daily food.

Head to Xieng Khouang province to learn the ancient art of natural dyeing and weaving from Hmong women. Or visit Ban Xang Hai (the ""Whisky Village"") just outside Luang Prabang to help distill Lao-Lao rice whisky using methods unchanged for centuries.

In southern Laos, particularly around Don Khong island, join local fishing families to try traditional net fishing in the Mekong. Up north in Nong Khiaw, shadow farmers during rice planting or harvesting seasons for a genuine taste of rural life.

For something more contemplative, many wats (Buddhist temples) welcome visitors for meditation sessions – Wat Sok Pa Luang in Vientiane holds sessions every Saturday.

**Which officially designated natural areas exist in Laos outside major urban centers, and what are the primary methods of accessing them?**

Laos boasts an impressive network of protected natural spaces that remain wonderfully uncrowded. Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area in northeastern Laos ranks as the country's largest conservation zone. You'll need to arrange transport from Luang Prabang or Sam Neua, typically via shared songthaew followed by a guided trek.

Nakai-Nam Theun National Park, sometimes called the ""Serengeti of Asia,"" houses incredible biodiversity including rare saola antelope. Access comes through organized tours from Thakhek, usually involving a combination of minivan transport and boat travel.

The spectacular Dong Natad Forest sits just 15km from Savannakhet and can be reached by tuk-tuk or motorbike rental. Meanwhile, Dong Phou Vieng National Protected Area in southern Laos requires a guide from nearby Pakse.

Hin Nam No National Protected Area (now a UNESCO site) features jaw-dropping karst landscapes. Most visitors arrange transportation through tour operators in Thakhek, involving a mix of road travel and boating.

For waterfall enthusiasts, Nam Ha National Protected Area near Luang Namtha offers pristine cascades accessed via guided treks. Local eco-tourism offices arrange necessary transport, usually minivans to trailheads followed by hiking.

Getting to these natural treasures typically involves:

* Booking through local eco-tourism offices
* Hiring guides (mandatory in many protected areas)
* Combining transport methods (songthaew/minivan/boat)
* Arranging homestays for multi-day visits

**Which locations in Laos have relatively low visitor volume but are officially noted or recommended for their cultural or natural significance?**

The sleepy riverside town of Muang Ngoi, accessible only by boat from Nong Khiaw, offers a glimpse into traditional Lao life virtually unchanged by tourism. Despite official recognition for its cultural preservation, most travelers skip it entirely.

Vieng Xai caves in Houaphanh Province housed the revolutionary Pathet Lao leadership during the ""Secret War."" Though historically crucial (and featured in official tourism materials), these impressive limestone caverns see a fraction of visitors compared to similar sites in Vietnam.

The ancient temple complex of Wat Phou Champasak predates Cambodia's Angkor Wat yet receives barely 10% of the visitors. UNESCO-protected since 2001, this magnificent Khmer ruin sits in splendid isolation about 30km south of Pakse.

Nam Nern Night Safari in Nam Et-Phou Louey earned international conservation awards for sustainable tourism, yet visitor numbers remain delightfully low. The Tourism Authority of Laos promotes it as a model ecotourism project.

The remote Bolaven Plateau, officially designated as a coffee-growing heritage region, offers stunning waterfalls, ethnic minority villages, and award-winning coffee plantations. Despite government promotion, it remains wonderfully uncrowded.

In central Laos, the officially protected archaeological wonder of Plain of Jars (Site 3) receives minimal visitors compared to the main Site 1, despite equal historical significance and government recommendations.

**Which modes of public or private transport are most commonly used in Laos, and what are their main operating schedules or routes?**

Navigating Laos means embracing a mix of transport options, each with its own quirks and charms. Songthaews (converted pickup trucks with bench seating) form the backbone of local transportation in most towns. They typically operate from 6am until dusk, following loosely defined routes with no fixed schedules – just flag one down when you see it!

For longer journeys, VIP buses connect major destinations like Vientiane-Luang Prabang (operating daily, 8am and 8:30pm departures) and Pakse-Savannakhet (daily, 7:30am and 1pm). These trips often take twice as long as the estimated time, so plan accordingly.

The revitalized train system now offers the Laos-China Railway connecting Vientiane to Boten (border town) with stops in Vang Vieng and Luang Prabang. Trains run four times daily (8am, 11:30am, 2:30pm, 6pm) with tickets available 3 days in advance.

Slow boats remain the quintessential way to travel the Mekong. The popular Huay Xai to Luang Prabang route operates daily (primarily 10:30am departures) with an overnight stop in Pakbeng.

For flexibility, motorbike rentals (typically $10-15/day) are widely available in tourist centers. Tuk-tuks dominate urban areas with negotiable fares and no fixed schedules.

Off the beaten path? Scheduled flights connect Vientiane to provincial capitals via Lao Airlines, with typical morning departures (8-11am) and reduced schedules during rainy season (May-September).

Laos remains one of Southeast Asia's best-kept secrets, offering far more than just the popular destinations of Luang Prabang and Vientiane. From the mysterious Plain of Jars to the serene 4000 Islands, the hidden gems highlighted in this guide provide authentic cultural experiences away from the tourist crowds. Whether you're traveling on a budget or seeking luxury experiences, Laos can accommodate your needs with its diverse tour options and breathtaking landscapes that change dramatically with the seasons.

1lb32uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1lb32uy/never_worked_a_day_at_a_place_i_wanted/,Never worked a day at a place I wanted,"I was kind of forced to start working at the age of 22 while I was completely not ready for any of it. My depression was extremely high at that moment and making money was the last thing I was worried about. But my mom told me that we are going to starve if I don't go, so I pushed myself to it. Later I found out that was a lie and she just hated me having my food for free and not paying for my stay at home.

I must admit that having a job in such condition is not doing you any favor. I had to push myself really hard as I didn't have any inner motivation for any of it. My mind refused to fake I'm into what I'm doing and I used to drown it with coffee and sweets just to prevent it from a total shutdown. I used to hit walls to the blood and I started squeezing my teeth unconsciously which led to heavy damages of it. I always used some kind of high value personal goal in order to convince myself to keep going. If anything went different from what I had planned, I would start losing it. I would loose my appetite first, just pushing the food on a schedule to prevent dystrophy. Later I would loose my sleep. I would need to talk to myself for hours every day just to convince myself to work and make it through.

Even having a good income doesn't make it feel good. I felt like I'm torturing myself for the money and couldn't build healthy relationships with me. It is like being a slave masters to yourself. I never felt stable even being a senior, never felt like spending money, starting a family or buying an apartment as I constantly felt that I can quit my job at any second and won't be able to pay the mortgage. I couldn't work for more than a year in a row and the moments I resigned were soooo relieving. 

I must also mention that there's zero help for a person in such situation. My best time in life was between the jobs when I used the money I saved for traveling, studying and spiritual practice. It really pushed me forward towards resolving my depression issue. But whoever was in my life just used to say that it's weird, pointless, I should just work and get married. To get a job I would make stories of normal people for my interviews. Lots of times I felt like the world is trying to kill me when getting another weird look of an HR or a refusal letter. I felt that they are pushing me to the lowest job possible, so I have no dignity, time or money to drag myself out of my misery.

I know I wouldn't be able to make it without the money, so I'm not sorry for the hell I went through. But still it makes me wonder why there's zero support or assistance to depressed people. Society rejects people with problems, isolate, push them down to where they won't be able to recover. I know it's life, I know life's hard, but just why. If you follow the agenda today, you will see all kinds of concerns for any minority out there, but not for sad people. Those are lives lost for any country of residence.

1lb2zpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1lb2zpg/bride_of_the_cursed_alpha_the_scent_grew_stronger/,Bride of the Cursed Alpha - The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light.,"The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.",1,1749886539.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Since I can remember, I’ve called him daddy and he called kid.

I love him because  he always protected me. Always provided for me. David Truman is what everyone out there would wish to have as a ward or father figure.

I was lonely  when he picked me up from child protective services and became my foster dad.

To others, David Truman was ruthless, coldhearted, and brutal. He kills without mercy. Fires without guilt. Hurts without batting an eye.

You cross his way, he slaughters. But, he’s more brutal, deadly, and violent when it comes to me.

David Truman is also known to be a great womanizer. Rumors had it that he'd taken about four wives. None of them were able to tame him nor handle his brutal side.

Hell, my daddy is one that could make you shiver with just one look. His demeanor  was always cold. He was always detached.

However, women  go horny at the glimpse of him. He's powerfully

built. Handsome like a god…I mean more handsome than any Greek god. He's about six-four. You can imagine how I craned my head whenever I wanted to look at him in my five-four.

All Tabloid  in the whole of America  features him as the most handsome  in the state. All gossip blogs feature how many women crush on him…yeah, my daddy is that swoon-worthy. He’s  hot. Sexy as fuck.

And to cap it all, my daddy came first in Forbes list of the richest men  in America.

That’s  my daddy. Powerful,  handsome, filthy-rich.

And as I read all these about my daddy. As I heard how women moaned whenever  he's brutally  fucking them, I wish it was me. I wanted to witness first hand who my daddy is.

I mean, the man makes me wet. I used to love him as my daddy but everything  changed when I turned eighteen.

My hormones became more pronounced, making me horny as fuck whenever  we were together.

I want my daddy to bed me.

I want my daddy to tease me with his cock. That monster cock of his.

I always finger myself

thinking about him.

I always dry humph my bed imagining his thick shaft stretching me  to the brim.

I want my daddy to want me.

My eighteenth

birthday  wish was for my daddy to fuck me senseless. I want my daddy to focus his attention  on me and avoid all other women.

Fuck! Thoughts about my daddy always sent shivers of need down my pussy.  I want nothing but for him to suckle my nipples, every day. I want his dick to tease my clit.

I want to be a vessel

for his pleasure  and him mine.

I want my daddy to be mine and me his.

I know it won’t  be an  easy  feat because

David Truman  only saw me as his daughter or so I thought. He  only saw me as a kid. He thought I was not old enough to have a sexuality. He thinks I’m the girl he had always protected from his immoral life. But he doesn’t  know I know his secret.

He doesn’t  know I watch him whenever  he dicks women in his bed, grunting at the mad pleasure.

I always watch him fuck them and wish it was me. I want it to be me, hell it’s  driving me crazy.

I’m now a nymphomaniac

just because  of my daddy. I do dirty things just to prepare myself  for the day he'll fuck me. But the man hasn’t batted an eye towards me.

He's overly treating me like I’m still the Vera he picked up from the CPS  from years before. But, only I know I’m not that girl again.

I’m a full grown woman now. A woman who wants sex from the man  she loves. A woman that can endure anything  from the man she loves.

Daddy, please bed me!

I won’t  stop tempting  him until he lost  it and comes to me.

I won’t  stop torturing  him, showing him how my body has grown  over the years until he succumbs and fucks me.

I want my daddy to, tease me.

Suckle on my essence.

Kiss me.

And most of all, make me his!

Yes, I’ll be a temptation  to David Truman.

Thank goodness, his guardianship  over me will end soon. So he'll stop thinking I’m a baby.

My daddy must make his. I must be my David’s woman!

  
Vera's POV.

“Vera!” Someone calls out to my name amidst the blaring music in the ballroom. I jerk, almost thinking the person I’m waiting for has at long last  arrive  but when I register  the voice as a feminine  one, I scrunch my nose.

It must be my all talkative BFF, Sage.  Tonight is our prom night. I’m a senior. In fact, in the coming months we'll graduate

and this is literally  my last prom in school.

Actually, we the seniors are allowed to bring a date even if they ain’t  from our school and I thought it wise to call the man I want.

I sigh, worried why he isn’t

on his phone nor here yet. I made sure to ring this event like a bell in his ears. It’s  my last prom in high school and I fucking want him here with me.

I whirl around in the direction  of the voice that called me and I see Sage strutting over in her signature cat walk. I take my BFF in. As always, Sage looks pretty. Hot even. Right now, her risqué red sequin dress is showing off her pert  body. She styled her hair in a close-cropped style.

If I’m into  girls, I swear I’ll be among those crushing on her. Sage has lured all the non straight girls in our school and she plays them.

In this our last year in school, she has fucked about six girls in the restroom  without giving a shit about the scandal that followed.

I smile when I notice

the V-neck  of my dress is more deeper than hers and I had worn it to lure one man. I seethe just as I remember

I’ve not heard from him at all.  I wonder where he is. He should be off work by now. A sigh, long enough to attract  attention

leaves my parted lips.

Sage’s  fuck-me louboutin  hammers against  the tiled floor just as she scoots closer to me.

“Girl, you look hot.” She showers me praise as she leans in to kiss my cheeks. I give a smile and peck her back, her soft rosy scent whiff my nostrils.

“Damn, I bet your daddy you got that…” She exclaims with a hint of sarcasm.  Sage will never  stop tagging me a daddy’s  girl because

of David’s  over protectiveness. Sometimes I wish he's doing that because

he loves me as his woman rather than his daughter or ward.

The man doesn’t even relent when I bitch about how I hate his attitude  towards me. He'd always say, ‘Kid, it’s  my duty to  protect you’ and usually  his voice is cold whenever  he says that. Once these words leave his lips, I can’t  argue further.

I swear I hate that about him because  it'll make my plans of him seeing me as a grown woman not to work.

“Sage, stop. Don’t

mock me now. I got the dress by myself. Not David.”  I slap her forearm as I spill it.

I was able to insist on buying the dress days before, if not David would have handled it the way he usually does. That day I hollered that these were my  final moments in  high school and I was old enough to buy a dress for myself  without his help.

Hmm…that man is really strong headed. I  wonder how his workers accommodate  his attitude. There had been many shits in gossip pages that tagged him as the most ruthless CEO in America.

Honestly, I somehow don’t

blame those that call him that. His attitude  can make someone  soil their dress, well except me.

David doesn’t  always come out ruthless or cold hearted to me unless that flare of protection  ripples inside him. He values my safety more than anything  else.

“Really? This is my first freaking  time seeing that. Great improvement  it is.” She quips.

“Sass…” I drawl, taking my eyes around the ballroom  filled with students and their dates.  Sage

does the same too, looking around. “Wait, you came with no date?” I ask and she shrugs.

“You already know how it goes…” She throw up a shoulder.

Yeah, sure I know…someone’s

going to either ask her to be her date or she woos a girl. Sage is an expert in wooing girls.

“Nick isn’t here yet? Where could  he be?” Sage asks me and it’s  then I realize that Nick isn’t  here yet. I’ve been so focused on David, I forgot  about my other BFF.

“I don’t know…I should call him.”  I open my phone and navigate through the contact list in search of Nick.

I dial him but his phone rings without him picking up. “Ain’t  answering,” I say.

Before I turn my attention

back to Sage, the girl has already marched across the room when a sexy chick strut into the ballroom.

The girl’s  blonde hair stands out in the crowd. It’s  so sparkling, it looks unnatural but I know it is because  I’ve heard so much about the girl’s  hair before.

Sage does her usual

thing by engaging the girl in a talk. It isn’t  hard for her to get the girl’s  attention. I cut my eyes away from them and walk over to the corner to help myself with a glass of water.

I want to stay sober and ensure my daddy comes here like I told him. I’d have been drowning in drinks by now…making out around and some shits that help cut my attention  away from him but I can’t.

I just want him here with me.  While I’m sipping the water, I see Nick walk in with a girl in his arms.

See, all my BFFs have a date except me. I raise my phone again and dial David.  He doesn’t  pick.  I can only assume he's shagging one of his whores.

My daddy is a blatant womanizer. I’ve never  seen him with a woman twice, except one person whom he had asserted to be the daughter of his business partner. His four wives all divorced  him because  he couldn’t

be faithful to them. Being faithful is totally  out of the league for him.

My mind always reminds me about that but I love him enough to care.  Since I came of age, my wishes had been  for my daddy to bang my pussy. I crave his love like an addict craves his drugs. The man is cutting through my mind always, driving me crazy. I can’t help it.

I always drip wet whenever I see him bare chested or working out in the gym…

“Vera, darling.” Nick comes to my side and kisses my lips, bringing some moments of distraction. I blush knowing he's doing it in front of his date.

Well, that’s  Nick's way  of greeting me but it’s  as platonic as can be.

“Meet my date, Angelina. You can call her Lina for short.” He tells me, a radiant smile on his face. Turning to Lina, he says. “And Lina, meet my BFF, Vera.”

I stretch out my hand and Lina takes it. “I know her.” She tells Nick as we shake hands.

Everyone in the whole school knows me as David Truman’s ward. Something  I came to despise since I started wanting him to be my partner.

Thankfully, his guardianship

over me will soon end. That parcel of news makes me happy.

“Yeah, of course, you must know her. Vera’s a girl with a big name. Is not Vera?” He directs the last sentence  to me and I shrug.

I practically  walk in David Truman’s  shadow, so whatever  popularity

he gets I get.

“Vera, we’re going to seal off this prom night at my place tonight. You in?” I know what he means.

Nick already mentioned

a pool party at his house and literally everyone in Dame High School will want to attend.

“Nick…I don’t  have a date!” I pout and thrash my feet.

“Darling, there are guys here! You'll definitely get wooed.” He winks by his right-hand side and I see him.

Harry. Damn, the boy wants to add to my list of Dame high school boys I fucked. Orally, mind you. Hell, he’s been on my throat all year round, and right now, he’s drenching me with his eyes.

Well…since the man I invited to be my date hasn’t  shown up yet, I guess Harry will have to stay in his place.

“See…?”  Nick shrieks when Harry starts coming towards us with his jet-black hair dangling with each step he takes. His suit hugs his features perfectly.

Hmm…don’t  get me wrong, Harry is one hell of a handsome high school boy. Literally, every high school girls' dream boyfriend, but he wants a relationship which I only want with David.

I want a man as a boyfriend, not a boy. Especially not the possessive  Harry Yates.

“Hi, Vera.” He says, kissing my knuckles.

“Hi…Harry.” I mutter, plastering a modicum of smile I’m able to piece together. Nick shepherds his date away, mouthing the time we're to live for the pool party and I nod.

“I can see you’re

alone. No date?” He sings out, locking his brown eyes on my features.

I shrug, lightly. Then. “As you can you…” I try to offer a response in return but he quickly spits, interrupting my mind that’s working on providing the best possible answer.

“Why don’t  you accept me, Vera?”  The way he rushed the words comes as a surprise and he surprises me further when he steps into my space, crowding me.

“I told you, I’m Interested in another.” I snap, hating that he always brings this up.  Harry’s eyes dim. He has always wanted to know who in Dame high school wants what he wanted.

Mind you, Harry is a notorious bully. I know he must have messed the person up if he was a high school boy. But, of course, the man I want is way stronger. Harry can never stand up to him.

“Then…can I be your date?” He offers.

The way his lips curl up tells me the dude can suckle on a pussy well. Maybe I can make do with him tonight.

“Fine.” I relent.

At that, Harry drags me gently to the dance floor.  We gyrate our hips together  to the Rihanna  music. I dance away my disappointment.

Harry holds the blades of my hips in a tight grip, shoving me against  his ass to alert me on how hard he is.

When it’s  time for us to depart for the pool party, he comes along. He walks me to my  Lamborghini. Andrei, my bodyguard  gives me the look and I tell him we're heading to a friend’s place.

He flutters the door

open and lets me in. He walks to the driver’s side and takes the wheel, driving  me away.

Of course, I don’t expect him to allow Harry into the car.

Knowing that David missed my last prom night, I fist my hands. He's going to get an earful from me ‘cause I know David Truman is somewhere fucking women.

  
David's POV.

“So, Charlie consult the marketing  team to handle the marketing of the new designs of the Truman’s  cars.” I rattle off to my assistant as I walk across the hallway to my office.

I just flew back from Arizona and rushed in  for a board meeting. Last night had been  hectic and fun too. My business  associate I went to Arizona to meet  hired women that gave us pleasure after the long hours of talks about business.

I had to rush back to New York  because

of the board meeting and the presentation my assistant  made in regard to the latest design of our cars.

Shit, I forgot to tell Vera about my flight to Arizona it was an emergency, I bet that’s  the reason she's been calling me.

I couldn’t  pick up the call because  I was in the boardroom  when she was calling.  Ah, I’ll call when I calm my  nerves down.

“Okay, sir,” Charlie mutters a response to my instructions. He rushes before me and  flutter my office door open for me to stride in. The boy’s too gentle. I’m sure I’ve told him several times to stop acting like I’m his god.

Having no strength  to counter his actions, I walk into my office. It’s  dark already and the New York city lights filter into my office like a cluster of stars. The glass floor-length windows allow smooth penetration.

Charlie flicks the lights on and walks across the room to the Espresso before handing me a coffee.

“Thank you, Charlie. You should go but don’t  forget what I told about the marketing.” My voice booms. Tired, I run my fingers over my eyelids and huff a breath.

I can manage a massage now. I search my mind on who to call. I’m  still deliberating in that when my door bangs open and Claire walks in.

Her feminine scent first brushes my nostrils, my nerves relaxing knowing one of my toys has come.  I’m already notorious in America for my Casanova  life. It’s  no longer a secret that David Truman fucks anything that has a V between  their legs and two soft globes around their chest.

My life has cost me my marriage  about four times. My first wife found out about my affair with my college girlfriend who was forced into marriage two years before we graduated. Helen swept me off my feet when I first saw her.

She was my first love but I was left heartbroken when my best friend, Nathan showed me images of her wedding photos. Too bad some shit happened and she died…I choose not to remember what went down that night, years back. But a miniature of her is under my roof. Under my care.

My second wife heard a scandal about me and my secretary  which wasn’t  exactly

true. I wasn’t  dicking my secretary  then. I don’t  know who recorded her making advances towards me.

My third… shit, she  had one of my toys walk up to her in a mall and rattle off how she enjoys  my cock dicking her.  Isabel filed for a divorce, saying I shattered her heart.  Then the forth  was the first that cheated on me with one of my associates because  she believed I don’t  give her attention. That I cheated on her from what my associate told her.

I did try my best in giving her attention. Just that I didn’t  meet her expectations in that department.

When I found her getting her pussy whipped by a tiny cock like Dane's, I divorced her.  After my last shit with my fourth wife, I decided  not to marry.

It’s better I fuck around in peace than being tied to one woman.  I wasn’t a man brought up with love that’s why I failed terribly in that sector. Though, Helen was an exception.

My parents never lived together because they weren’t a match. Their union was toxic and that toxicity led to my mother’s  death at a young  age.

I was just eight then. Then I lived with my father. He toughened me up. Lived just the same kind of life I’m living.  He was flourishing then. Truman’s  empire was among the first in the country but when he died and everything was hands-down transferred to me, I notched the empire forward.

Now, Truman empire is known all over the world. I always top the Forbes list. Proudly, I’m every woman’s wet dreams.

My second wife, Anita, is trying to snake back into my life. I know she must have squandered all her alimony because all my exes were paid millions of dollars after our divorce. However, I don’t eat what I already rejected.

Claire’s  voice snaps me out of my thoughts and I smile up at her which she returns. Claire’s  divorced

and her father and I are new business partners.

There’s an asset I’d like to gain from him. That asset will birth billions which I’ll fund my charity organization with.

“Didn’t tell me you’re

back, sweetie.” She purrs, walking to my side. I smirk up at her. Some rumors have it that Claire divorced her multi-millionaire husband because of me.

I never bother to ask because rumors are usually  fake. I can’t believe she can do that. Moreover, it doesn’t  stop me from fucking her whenever  she throws herself  at me.

No matter how  much I fuck women, none of them seem to sate

me. I guess I’m insatiable that’s  why my cock keeps dicking as much pussy as it can.

“It was my father that informed me about your arrival.” She says, sliding across the table to me.

I take in her skimpy dress and fuck…she’s a bit intact.

“Turn around for me,” I order her, and like an obedient girl, she whirls around and shimmy that ass of hers.

My cock jerks alive, loving the way she jiggles those flesh for me. I naughtily smack the flesh of her ass.

I love how she succumbs to my will. I always dominate women, it’s in my nature. I smack her again, and she purrs.

“Get to your knees, Claire.” I command and on a whim, bitch throws herself on her knees, sliding between my legs.

My hard-on is already pressing harshly against my fly. I unzip and palm my cock out, breath hugely leaving me as I free the monster.

Claire’s sigh is apparent. It’s  not my first time ordering her to suck me but she practically

screams whenever  I get myself  free in front of her.

Quickly, she encloses her tiny palms around me and starts to stroke her tongue over my dick before sheathing me with her mouth.

I exhale, fist her hair, and push myself  to the hilt.

“Suck me clean, Claire.” I grunt.  I throw my head back, focusing on the release I want most while she fusses over my cock with her mouth, dragging up and down to my base with her tongue.

“Mmmm…David…” She wails around my cock, the sound reverberating around my thighs and dick as I push into her  mouth, trying to see if I can get the ultimate  release  I want.

Without gusto, I jizz in her mouth.

She jerks in surprise

when I push her away and stand to my feet, my hand running through  my hair.

Sex is fun but I can’t  get the comfort I desperately  desire. The connection.

“Anything amiss?” She asks, wiping my jizz from the corner of her mouth.

I shake my head. “Wait here.” I gesture  for her to grab a seat while I grasp my cell and call Vera again.

Fuck, she doesn’t

pick. She’s  ought to pick. She should be in her room by now.

I tried again, yet no response. Frustrated, I dial Andrei's number. The man is a few years older than me and he was there when I took Vera in. So he's as much her father as I am.

I made Andrei Vera’s personal bodyguard, so he follows her wherever  she decides to go.

Andrei  gets his call on the first ring, his brass voice weaving into my ears. “Boss.”

“Where’s  Vera? She ain’t  picking my calls.” My voice comes out strained, and worried.

“With her friends. In a pool party.” Andrei response uproots anger in me.

He dare allow Vera to stay out until now?

“The fuck? Where is that?”

I bite out, doing all I can to douse my anger.

I can’t allow Vera to risk her life, especially knowing the huge threat lurking around to sink its claws into her. Protecting her is my very first duty. It’s  a promise I made, and whoever wants to come to her will get through me first. That’s

the reason I don’t  always allow her the opportunity  to always go out.

“At Broadway, boss.”

I grab my hands into fists. I try to speak but Andrei beat me to it. “It’s her last prom night today boss. Remember?”

Andrei's words make me stall as I start remembering  Vera’s

words from weeks before.

It’s  her last prom tonight and I’m not there for her. Fuck! I messed up.

Kid’s not gonna be happy. I'll try to appease her in any way I can. I just want her to go home.

I clear my throat and spill into the speaker. “Take her home now, Andrei!”

“Noted, boss.”

At that, he hangs up.

I feel Claire’s  hand skim across my shoulders and she mewl into my ears after kissing the side of my face. “Fuck, David. I’m horny.”

I grin at her, my cock jerks awake as she cups me through my fly.

“Sprawl on the table. Show me that pussy.” And she does it without delay.

Her groin has some streaks of hair that form a straight  line, dipping onto the apex of her pussy lip.  I rip off the wrapper over the condom and shield my cock before reaching for her.

I widen her thighs, and without preamble, I hold my dick and plunge into her pussy.

Fuck! Her hole is too loose. No longer tight. In between stroking her with my manhood, I keep slipping off.

Fuck! Most women I’ve taken are too loose for my liking. I’ve never fucked a tight pussy. Either way, I violently thrust into Claire and she yelps as my dick ravages her wall.

My fingers seize her glaring tits and I squeeze.

“Oh…fuck…fuck…David!!!” She screams begging me to stop but fuck, I’ve not gotten any release.

I thrust, dip, fuck…yet…yet no relief.

Annoyed, I pull out as she jerks on the desk while I start palming my cock…grunting at the process.",1,1749886348.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I want my mate, I want you!” he steps closer and I shake my head no, a whimper slipping from my lips.","Leslie!” I call out down the empty hall, my heart racing and stomach twisting in fear. Of all the days for the Alpha’s daughter to disappear, she had to choose her wedding day. I frown at the door at the end of the hall, a sock on the handle, and I roll my eyes. Clearly, she has found herself a partner for the night and overslept. Not unusual for her lately.

I jiggle the door handle, finding it locked, and groan in annoyance as I reach into my hair and withdraw out a pin to pick the lock. The handle clicks, the door swinging open and I am slammed in the face with the divine smell of eucalyptus and cottonwood.

My wolf perks up, and my eyes grow wide when I step into the room, flipping on the switch and my heart stutters. Leslie sits at the foot of the bed wrapped in a white sheet, hair and makeup askew. She looks at me and her eyes grow wide, and then she covers her mouth as she runs toward the bathroom, retching along the way.

The sound of her vomiting floats through the silence, and I feel my stomach churning as well. I struggle with my wolf, trying like hell to resist the urge to look to the right and find the source of the smell.

My mate is in this room, but after seeing the state of Leslie, I’m not sure I’m ready to meet him. Not like this. My heart flutters and my chest aches simultaneously. If he is in here, then he’s been IN Leslie…and that’s enough to break my heart.

“Cole…” His voice is soft and full of regret, and it’s all it takes to break me. Grady. Heavens no…

“No…” I whimper, the tears welling up in my eyes as I clutch the bodice of the ridiculous dress Leslie asked me to wear as her personal aide.

His gentle hands grab my arm, the telltale sparks zipping through me and my heart sinks further into my gut. Grady tugs me toward him and the seconds bleed into what feels like minutes as I look up into my best friend’s face. The guy I have loved since I was little. The man who I was hoping to find as my mate today…and I did. In the most horrible way possible.

“You slept with Leslie?” I ask, swallowing down the burn of acid in my throat.

“We didn’t know how to tell you.” Leslie says from the bathroom door, her eyes red and face white as the sheet hiding her naked body, but I can see the glimmer of pleasure in her eyes, the way she is relishing in my pain.

“You guys are…” I turn my face away, hating the taste of the words on the tip of my tongue. “Together?”

“No,” Grady chuckles dryly, tugging me to him, my body igniting with his addictive touch.

“Yes.” Leslie counters with a growl.

“What?” Grady and I blink at her and her jaw clenches as she glares at Grady.

I wish I could disappear, escape from this awful nightmare as I try to free myself from his clutches. The room stinks of sweat and sex and every second I stand here, the threat of falling to pieces turns into an inevitability. I need air. Fresh, untainted, clean air.

“I mean, you’ve been screwing me for months, Grady,” she scoffs. “We are more than fuck buddies at this point.”

“For months,” I repeat, her words echoing in my head as I yank free of Grady’s hold, trying to rub the filth of him off my skin. The hurt in his eyes makes me second guess myself for a moment before I stumble back to get further from him. He is suffocating, his scent swirling around me, almost calming until I smell her on him. The overly sweet vanilla and cinnamon that makes me queasy.

“Almost three months, if you want to be precise.” Leslie says with an unbothered shrug.

My eyes fly wide, my head whipping to Grady for confirmation, and he drops his chin in defeat, shoulders deflating. His bare chest heaves up and down as though the air from the room is thin. For a moment he glances up, his eyes pleading as he reaches out for me and I flinch away.

“It was just sex, Colette, I swear. I want my mate, I want you!” he steps closer and I shake my head no, a whimper slipping from my lips.

Grady growls as he paces away, his hands in his hair. He yells out in frustration. I notice something on his back and my heart stutters. Long pink trails where her nails dug into his back and there is no going back as the bile rushes up my throat, filling my mouth.

I push past Leslie, running to the bathroom, and I vomit the three cups of coffee I anxiously drank this morning in anticipation of today. The world spins around me as I lean over the toilet, feeling faint with the tears streaming as I heave painfully again.

I reach for a square of toilet paper and wipe my lips, tossing it into the trash and freeze when my eyes glimpse the long, white item sticking partially out. My heart thuds in my ears as I star eat it. The little blue plus sign. A positive pregnancy test.

“Leslie…” I call out in a shaky voice. “Grady is the only male you have been seeing?” My eyes slide closed, a prayer on my lips begging her to say that she has been with lots of men, that maybe there is a hope that Grady isn’t the father.

“Of course, I take our relationship seriously,” she announces proudly, and I bite back a sob. Grady was my light spot. The star in the bleak sky that lit my life. And now that star has turned into a black hole, sucking any chance I had at happiness.

“You are supposed to be getting married today.” I whisper, steadying myself in the bathroom's doorway, my knees weak and vision blurry.

“Supposed to,” she says with a mischievous smirk.

“This isn’t just some random Alpha, Leslie.” Grady says, reminding her of her duty. She agreed to this union even though she doesn’t like the idea of it.

1lb2w5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/hoarding/comments/1lb2w5p/lost_trust_after_betrayal_by_family_member/,Lost Trust After Betrayal by Family Member,"Hi, this is my first post here. I'm almost 59 & grew up in a hoarder house. My mother was one (she grew up during the Depression), & of course so am I. I inherited most of her stuff because I still live in my childhood home. I'm not sure what level a hoarder she was but the stuff definitely wasn't wall to wall, mostly just a lot of clutter plus a lot of cardboard boxes full of stuff stacked up in the corner of her room. 

I live on my own, and I'm on a disability pension due to several conditions and inherited my mother's kidney disease & at age 38 I had to start dialysis, which I did for almost 6 years. I got a kidney transplant in 2011 & because I've had more energy & time, I've been cleaning up my hoard since then & doing little jobs around the house. My kidney function isn't great so I can't function like a normal healthy person but over the years I've been doing a little bit at a time and been able to make a lot of progress. 

It's only a small 2-bedroom house so I don't have a lot of room for stuff & can't afford to move anywhere else. And here in Australia, attics & basements aren't really a thing. I think having a basement & attic would've solved all my clutter problems. I've had a few health setbacks during that time which would land me in hospital for 3 to 4 weeks at a time, and during those times my home would end up a bit messy again (due to not being able to sweep, mop, do dishes, etc). 

Most of my ""hoard"" is stuff I've collected (books, magazines, DVDs, etc) and most of it is in shelves or inside storage boxes. Including some rare out-of-print books. I don't normally leave food scraps in the kitchen (I have a backyard compost bin) but it has happened a handful of times when I've been too sick to do housework. I've been asked by the hospital if I want a cleaner to help me but I wouldn't trust anyone & they'd find out my hoarding secret. 

I still have some of Mum & Dad's things boxed up in their bedroom, which my sister says I can't throw away without her permission as she's the executor of their Wills. But she lives over 3 hours away & isn't well enough to come & sort their stuff out. So I'm lumbered with it. I asked her to take some of it but she's a hoarder too & doesn't have the room. 

She denies being a hoarder because she says she doesn't have any rotting food laying around but I told her there are different levels of hoarding. You have to walk through a narrow pathway when you go inside her front door. At least I don't have any narrow pathways lol.

I haven't been able to have a handyman come inside to fix anything. Or have a cleaner help me. It's not just due to clutter but also because the house is so old (built 1906) & most of the furniture is too.  I have smoke damaged walls in the kitchen, not from smoking, but from the old wood stove we used to cook on. I've painted walls & some furniture but the ceilings are really high & I'm not as good on ladders as I used to be.... so the kitchen ceiling still looks bad. 

I do have a few ""junk boxes"" which have a mixture of stuff which I've been sorting through (throwing out the rubbish & recyclables and keeping the good stuff) but I need to get a few more smaller storage boxes to sort that stuff into. It's not easy for me to get shelves or boxes as I don't drive. I recently bought a mobility scooter but can only bring 1 or 2 boxes home at a time. 

Because of my kidney disease, I developed Gout in 2022 & my doctor couldn't figure out what my foot pain was. Some days I had pain only in one foot so I walked with a cane but other days it was in both feet and I had to crawl around. I had that for 10 months before my doctor figured out it was gout & put me on medication. 

Sadly a short time after that in Sep 2023, I was coming home on my Ebike from the store & a car failed to give way & hit me. I ended up with 2 fractured legs (right knee, left ankle) and ended up in hospital for 2 months. The doctor wouldn't let me come home until I could walk with 2 crutches because I live on my own (with 2 cats). 

I was worried I was going to have to have an inspection of my home before I came home from hospital as the other patients seemed to. I was worried they might report me to the local council as a hoarder and they might come & clean my house out. The worst part was, I'd hardly recovered from the Gout episode when I had that accident... so my home was a bit messier than normal. 

Then my youngest niece volunteered to help me with storage. I wondered if she'd get one of those storage sheds or just hire a storage unit for a short time until I could sort more stuff. 

While I was in hospital, she spent almost 3 days in my home & I thought she'd been packing up stuff in boxes and putting it into storage (shed or a unit). But after 2 days, she texted me to ask about all the stuff packed up in boxes.  I wondered why she wanted to know about that stuff because it's all clean, all been sorted & packed up into boxes. 

When I realised she was opening up my storage boxes, I went into a panic. I wanted to tell her they were none of her business & to leave them alone but I was too scared of angering her while she still had access to my home.

I wished I could've told her to get out but I don't actually own my home. Dad left it for me to live in but my 2 nieces don't inherit it until I die. She'd probably tell me I can't order her to leave because I don't own the place. Yeah but I do own the contents of the house especially stuff I bought with my own money. I was in absolute torment until she left the next day. 

She came to see me in hospital before she left & told me she'd put my wheelie bin out for collection. I felt as if I'd been kicked in the stomach because I had a strong feeling she'd thrown stuff out she shouldn't have. I thought ""she shouldn't have been able to get a whole bin's worth of rubbish out"". 

After she left, my sister & brother-in-law (her parents) were still in the room. I wanted to ask them to bring my bin back in as I suspected stuff had been thrown out but I thought they'd side with her & tell me she would never do a thing like that. I didn't have any proof, just a gut feeling. I even thought of asking my next door neighbour for help. I wish I had now as they told me they would've brought my bin in. 

It wasn't until I got home from hospital that I discovered how much stuff was actually missing & it astounded me.... the macrame owl I made when I was 12 & which used to hang on the kitchen wall, my favourite coffee mug which had a tiny chip in the rim (on the other side from where I drank from), cups, bowls, cutlery, and the worst of all, some valuable antique stuff (e.g. my mother's jewellery which included WW2 Victory souvenir pins & medals from 1945). 

I wondered why my niece had thrown out the antique items. Did she even notice them or just threw stuff away without even looking at them? I guess when you're a hoarder, people think every single item in your house is nothing but trash which needs chucking out so they don't even bother sorting through it. I should've realised her attitude to my stuff when she turned up wearing a PPE suit, mask, goggles & gloves.... but I don't have rotting food, rodents, insects, just clutter which needs sorting into shelves & boxes etc. 

I got upset with her for throwing out possessions which were not only valuable but of tremendous sentimental value (gifts given to me by my mother & other relatives for b'days etc). I said I hadn't given her permission to throw any of my possessions out, just to box stuff up & help with storage until I could sort it all. I mainly needed help bringing home boxes & shelves, not help throwing stuff out. 

She told me to never talk to her about it or she'd get really angry with me & never talk to me again. She said she doesn't believe in keeping stuff for sentimental value & doesn't think you can feel closer to a deceased loved one by holding onto any of their stuff. Her sister & mother (my sister) have stopped talking to me too. The worst thing is the hospital never even insisted I have a home inspection before they released me so my niece's so-called ""clean up"" was all for nothing. 

I feel so betrayed because I'd trusted her & she must've thrown out everything she laid her hands on & didn't even sort any of it. I think she came here under false pretenses because she told me she was coming to help with storage but in reality, she'd just come to try to clean the place out. 

I guess when she promised to put my stuff into storage, she really meant into the rubbish bin. She must think the only way to deal with a hoarder is to just throw all their stuff out behind their back... even though I'm not the worst level hoarder & most of my stuff is packed up neatly in boxes. That's what I get for letting someone into my home without me being there. 

Since that incident, I've been suffering from severe trauma & anxiety attacks, and my level of trust of other people has dropped to almost zero. I now wish I'd never handed her my house key. It's one of the worst decisions I've ever made but my relatives all make out I'm the bad guy.  My niece reminds me of my Dad who used to throw my possessions out when I was a child & when I'd cry, he'd laugh in my face. I told my niece she's like my Dad (her grandfather) but she got angry as she couldn't stand him. 

She even said I should've asked her for help when I had Gout & had problems walking. I thought ""No thanks, I don't want her kind of help"" because she just seems to throw everything out she gets her hands on. I think when I die, my nieces will probably just hire a rubbish skip & throw the whole contents of my home into it even valuable items, rare books in good condition, etc. because they're too lazy to sort anything & have plenty of money themselves, and just don't give a crap.

I'm still in the process of tidying up & since I recovered from my leg fractures (although I still have a limp), I've made great progress. I have a much smaller amount of clutter now & most of my valued possessions have been boxed up or put into shelving. Because I can't have anyone in my home, I've had to build all the shelves myself. That was easy when I was young but now I think ""I'm getting too old for all this crap"". 

It's taken me a long time to tidy up because I sort through stuff with a fine tooth comb & because of my health I can't put in a full day's work. But I've been chipping away at it for years & it's finally paying off as my home is so much neater than it used to be... although I'm sure it'd never be good enough for my clean-freak niece (eyeroll). But sadly I've learnt that I can never trust anyone ever again!

I have been staying at their hotels ever since the '80s when I would travel with my parents as a kid. They had friendly staff, clean facilities, and good restaurants. But recently (since 2021 or so), they have gone downhill. The staff are rude and barely acknowledge you, the front desk people are too busy looking at their phones, and when they finally talk to you, they act like the staff at the DMV. They throw you a chewed-up key card and you have to lug all your bags up to your room because the bellhop is out on his smoke break. The room smells, and the AC sounds like a jet engine, but despite that, the room stays hot all night. The showers don't have hot water, there is hair in the sink, rats running around, and condom wrappers in the trash that housekeeping apparently didn't notice. Housekeeping never comes to clean your room, but they leave the envelopes and QR codes for you to ""tip"" them for their work, or the lack thereof. When you order room service, it never comes, but they still charge you for it, and then refuse to remove the charge.

That’s right—PairSoft has unleashed AI agents on accounts payable automation, ushering in a brave new world where invoices basically file themselves.

**Automate the Mundane**

Imagine a world where manual work is as extinct as VHS tapes. PairSoft's AI agents dive into the drudgery of GL coding, PO matching, and invoice approval, handling these with the precision that only a tireless digital worker can muster. No more human error at 3 PM on a Monday. Your finance team can now focus on the stuff that really matters, like strategic planning and debating whether bean bag chairs are an appropriate office expense.

**Why CFOs are All-In on AI**

According to PYMNTS Intelligence, 38% of CFOs are already aboard the AI-train for AP programs with another 43% eyeing the tracks. It’s not just about efficiency; it’s about unleashing the Kraken of productivity on your financial operations. With large enterprises leading the charge, smaller firms too might soon discover that AI isn’t just an accessory but a necessity.

**Future-Proofing Financials**

PairSoft’s AI rollout is just the opening act. Their vision sees AI as co-pilot, not captain. Spend management and other critical areas still need that irreplaceable human touch, a sentiment echoed by their Chief Product Officer, Sami Peltonen. The aim? To keep AI as a tool, not a replacement—a refreshing perspective in an age where automation sometimes feels like it’s trying to replace your morning coffee ritual.

He yells out in frustration. I notice something on his back and my heart stutters.","“Leslie!” I call out down the empty hall, my heart racing and stomach twisting in fear. Of all the days for the Alpha’s daughter to disappear, she had to choose her wedding day. I frown at the door at the end of the hall, a sock on the handle, and I roll my eyes. Clearly, she has found herself a partner for the night and overslept. Not unusual for her lately.

I jiggle the door handle, finding it locked, and groan in annoyance as I reach into my hair and withdraw out a pin to pick the lock. The handle clicks, the door swinging open and I am slammed in the face with the divine smell of eucalyptus and cottonwood.

My wolf perks up, and my eyes grow wide when I step into the room, flipping on the switch and my heart stutters. Leslie sits at the foot of the bed wrapped in a white sheet, hair and makeup askew. She looks at me and her eyes grow wide, and then she covers her mouth as she runs toward the bathroom, retching along the way.

The sound of her vomiting floats through the silence, and I feel my stomach churning as well. I struggle with my wolf, trying like hell to resist the urge to look to the right and find the source of the smell.

My mate is in this room, but after seeing the state of Leslie, I’m not sure I’m ready to meet him. Not like this. My heart flutters and my chest aches simultaneously. If he is in here, then he’s been IN Leslie…and that’s enough to break my heart.

“Cole…” His voice is soft and full of regret, and it’s all it takes to break me. Grady. Heavens no…

“No…” I whimper, the tears welling up in my eyes as I clutch the bodice of the ridiculous dress Leslie asked me to wear as her personal aide.

His gentle hands grab my arm, the telltale sparks zipping through me and my heart sinks further into my gut. Grady tugs me toward him and the seconds bleed into what feels like minutes as I look up into my best friend’s face. The guy I have loved since I was little. The man who I was hoping to find as my mate today…and I did. In the most horrible way possible.

“You slept with Leslie?” I ask, swallowing down the burn of acid in my throat.

“We didn’t know how to tell you.” Leslie says from the bathroom door, her eyes red and face white as the sheet hiding her naked body, but I can see the glimmer of pleasure in her eyes, the way she is relishing in my pain.

“You guys are…” I turn my face away, hating the taste of the words on the tip of my tongue. “Together?”

“No,” Grady chuckles dryly, tugging me to him, my body igniting with his addictive touch.

“Yes.” Leslie counters with a growl.

“What?” Grady and I blink at her and her jaw clenches as she glares at Grady.

I wish I could disappear, escape from this awful nightmare as I try to free myself from his clutches. The room stinks of sweat and sex and every second I stand here, the threat of falling to pieces turns into an inevitability. I need air. Fresh, untainted, clean air.

“I mean, you’ve been screwing me for months, Grady,” she scoffs. “We are more than fuck buddies at this point.”

“For months,” I repeat, her words echoing in my head as I yank free of Grady’s hold, trying to rub the filth of him off my skin. The hurt in his eyes makes me second guess myself for a moment before I stumble back to get further from him. He is suffocating, his scent swirling around me, almost calming until I smell her on him. The overly sweet vanilla and cinnamon that makes me queasy.

“Almost three months, if you want to be precise.” Leslie says with an unbothered shrug.

My eyes fly wide, my head whipping to Grady for confirmation, and he drops his chin in defeat, shoulders deflating. His bare chest heaves up and down as though the air from the room is thin. For a moment he glances up, his eyes pleading as he reaches out for me and I flinch away.

“It was just sex, Colette, I swear. I want my mate, I want you!” he steps closer and I shake my head no, a whimper slipping from my lips.

Grady growls as he paces away, his hands in his hair. He yells out in frustration. I notice something on his back and my heart stutters. Long pink trails where her nails dug into his back and there is no going back as the bile rushes up my throat, filling my mouth.

I push past Leslie, running to the bathroom, and I vomit the three cups of coffee I anxiously drank this morning in anticipation of today. The world spins around me as I lean over the toilet, feeling faint with the tears streaming as I heave painfully again.

I reach for a square of toilet paper and wipe my lips, tossing it into the trash and freeze when my eyes glimpse the long, white item sticking partially out. My heart thuds in my ears as I star eat it. The little blue plus sign. A positive pregnancy test.

“Leslie…” I call out in a shaky voice. “Grady is the only male you have been seeing?” My eyes slide closed, a prayer on my lips begging her to say that she has been with lots of men, that maybe there is a hope that Grady isn’t the father.

“Of course, I take our relationship seriously,” she announces proudly, and I bite back a sob. Grady was my light spot. The star in the bleak sky that lit my life. And now that star has turned into a black hole, sucking any chance I had at happiness.

“You are supposed to be getting married today.” I whisper, steadying myself in the bathroom's doorway, my knees weak and vision blurry.

1lb2ni2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lb2ni2/too_fast_extraction_bbe/,Too fast extraction [BBE],"Hi! Around 2 years ago I’ve bought a Breville Barista Express, but I still struggle to extract a decent shot of espresso. 

Here’s what I’m currently using:
1. Store-bought but freshly opened beans (roasted a couple of months ago). I’ve also tried using beans from a local roaster, that didn’t help me with the extraction time
2. Single-wall single shot basket along with a standard Breville portafilter. Can’t really use the double shot one since I’m the only one who drinks coffee and a single shot is enough for me. Double-wall basket apparently does a better job (while still under 20sec) but everyone in this subreddit keeps saying not to use it
3. Around 1:3 water ratio
4. 10g of ground coffee currently (using coffee scale, precise amount)
5. Built-it grinder setting 6. I know the answer is “grind finer” but in this case the pressure goes over the gauge and the water is not dripping at all

Having all that, my shot takes maximum 16 sec to extract (counting from the very beginning). Also I have crema on my coffee and sometimes it tastes ok. I just feel like I’m extracting it the wrong way and it can taste much better. I’ve read many posts from this subreddit and considered different improvements to my technique.

Chapter 1: The Beginning Finding His Mate

I was finally able to fall asleep after cleaning the house, washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making dinner, and getting my brothers and sister to bed, not to mention getting my homework done. I have a major paper due tomorrow, and I just finished it. Getting it done with three three-year-old toddlers running around is not the easiest thing to do. I had just finally fallen into a deep slumber when I was ripped out of bed and dragged down the stairs. Damn that is going to leave a mark or two. “What the fuck is this shit?” My mother yelled at me. “Your father will be home soon, get this shit cleaned up!” She shouted, throwing me in the kitchen. “First of all, you made this mess, I had everything spotless, so you need to clean up after yourself and secondly, he’s NOT my FATHER!” I spat back. My mother reared back and slapped me so hard that she drew blood and making me fall back to the floor. I shook my head slightly trying to get my bearings back. “He IS your FATHER! Now get this shit cleaned up before he gets home.” She shrieked at and stormed out of the kitchen to her room. This isn’t the first time she has done this; she would come home and make a mess and tell him that I didn’t do any of my chores. My mom’s not as bad as he can be, he can be downright evil. He beat me so badly once that I could hardly move and of course that meant I couldn’t clean, cook, or take care of the triplets and that made things worse, and it led to another beating. I had to force myself up to get things done. Eventually I fell into a routine and was able to get everything done, even on the days when my mom came home in a bitchy mood.

I was in the middle of cleaning up the mess my mom made when HE walked into the kitchen. “What is this shit? Why is nothing clean!” I heard him bellow. I was already pissed at mom, so this was not going to be good for me in the end. “It was clean until your wife got home and decided that her day wasn’t complete until she made mine into shit!” I spat; my words laced with venom. “What did you say?!” He snarled. I saw his eyes shift back and forth between his brown color to pitch black. He always did that when he got angry. “You heard me; I didn’t stutter.” I yelled at him as I finished cleaning up after my mom. “Don’t you ever speak about your mother like that!” He yelled, the next thing I knew pain was shooting down my neck. I fell to my knees grabbing the back of my head. I tried to stand but his fist cracked against the right side of my face. “You will show us some respect!” He growled out standing over me. “I told you he wouldn’t be happy.” Mom sneered. “C’mon Freddy dear, I’m tired, it’s been a long day.” She told him rubbing herself against him, that is so gross. He pulled her to his chest as she purred in his arms. She gave him her, what she calls, her sexy smile and walked out of the kitchen, swaying her hips. “I better not find any blood here in the morning. You understand?” He yelled. I didn’t answer so he repeated himself and he hated to repeat himself. “DO. YOU. UNDERSTAND.” He gritted out. “DO NOT MAKE ME REPEAT MYSELF.” He growled as he towered over me, and I nodded my head.

Once I was finally finished cleaning the kitchen, again, I went to bed, praying I could get a few hours of sleep before my alarm went off. My alarm clock went off at five a.m., I groaned and shut it off. I went to my bathroom as quietly as I could since the triplets slept in my room. I did my business, showered, brushed my teeth, and got started on trying to hide the bruises on my face. They were a little darker than usual, so I wasn’t able to cover them all the way. I did the best I could. I walked out of the bathroom to find my little ones wide awake and sitting quietly waiting for me. Fred has them trained and so scared not to cry, yell, or throw temper tantrums. He beat me in front of them when they misbehaved and told them that if they keep it up, he will do the same thing to them. It only took for them to see him beat me once and they never made a peep again. I would take a beating for them anytime; the slightest squeal of joy would throw both of into a fit of rage. Imagine that the squeal of happiness from their children makes them angry.

“Stowme.” I heard Ryder call out softly. “Good morning my little loves. Did you sleep well?” I asked, helping them from their bed and placed them on the floor. They nodded their heads with yawns. “C’mon, we need to get you cleaned up and outta your jammies.” I told them as they waddled to the bathroom. Nancy never took care of them, except for the first six months after they were born she was a good mom and I thought that maybe she would change but when they turned six-month-old, she started back to work and would stay out late. Fred moved their stuff into my room and told me that they are now my problem and responsibility and that they are my kids now. By the time I got the four of us ready it was six thirty. I took them downstairs, packed their snack bags, their sippy cups, grabbed our backpacks and quietly made our way out the door. Fred and Nancy were still asleep, they slept until whenever they decided to get up. They both worked in the evening until sometime in the early morning hours, it usually worked out because we hardly ever had to see each other, unless Nancy was in one of her moods or I accidentally came face to face with one of them.

My first class started at eight fifteen, giving me a little over an hour to drop them off at daycare, which was on campus, run by the child development department. Since I didn’t have money to pay I explained my situation to them, well except the beatings. They were able to find a scholarship to help pay for the triplets fees, they even offered me a job to help me make some money to take care of my siblings. “Good morning, Stormie.” Mrs. Black, the director of the center, greeted. “Morning.” I chirped back. “Mowny.” The triplets greeted in unison. “Why good morning little ones. Are you ready to get your day started?” She asked them, bending down to their level. “Yesh ma’am.” They smiled. “Well come along, you can help me get things ready. Get your bags and say goodbye to mom.” They walked over to me, who they call mama, I put their backpacks on them, and they each gave me a hug and kiss and waddled off with Mrs. Black. Mrs. Black turned to me and mouthed, See ya later. I waved at Mrs. Black and made my way out. The weather was starting to change, it was getting cooler, the leaves were changing colors and that means winter break is around the corner. I hate winter break; the beatings always got worse.

“Hi, what would you like?” The girl behind the counter asked with boredom. “A large hot mocha please.” I was digging through my bag looking for my wallet when the girl said, “four dollars and twenty-five cents, please.” She huffed at me. “Sorry, sorry, sorry, I have my wallet in here somewhere.” I smiled at her. “Look lady, if you can’t pay, why did you order?” “I can pay, I just can’t find my wallet.” “You’re holding up the line.” She snapped. I turned around and saw that there were six people behind me. “C’mon lady, hurry up!” Someone grunted. “Yeah, we’re gonna be late for class.” I blushed in embarrassment. “Sorry,” I said one more time and ran out. I couldn’t help it, but I started crying. As I was hurrying out, I bumped into a wall, well it felt like a wall, but it turned out to be a person a very HUGE person, a male person. I bumped into him so hard that we both dropped our things. I quickly picked up my things. “I’m so sorry.” I muttered looking at the stranger. We made eye contact and wholly shitzu, I felt like I was hit by a lightning bolt. Who is this Greek God looking back at me? He has the deepest gray eyes, shoulder length black hair and his lips, his oh so plump kissable lips. What is wrong with me? I don’t even know him, and my lower region is on fire. I heard him say, “MATE - MINE.” I gave him a confused look and then he shook his head lightly. “Are you okay?” His voice sent chills down my spine. “Umm…Yeah, I’m fine.” I answered him softly as he extended his hand to help me up. I reluctantly put my hand in his. I had no idea what happened, but I felt jolts of electricity flow through my body. He felt it also because he inhaled sharply. I pulled my hand away from his and thought I heard a low growl from him. The way he looked at me made me wish I had a change of panties. “Uh, again, sorry. I need to go. I’m gonna be late for class.” I said backing away from him. I wasn’t anywhere from being late for class, I still had at least an hour, but I couldn’t chance letting him get any ideas that I was interested in him, even though I wouldn’t mind climbing that mountain. He opened his mouth to say something, but I turned tail and ran off. What did he mean by saying, MATE MINE? I knew I could never belong to anyone, except of course to Fred, he would never let me go. Although I’m sure my mom wouldn’t mind, she wouldn’t miss us, she would be free to live her life like she wants, not that she doesn’t already.

I was deep in thought when I heard someone clear their throat and ask, “Are you okay?” I looked up and saw a pretty blue eyed, perky blonde smiling at me. “Yeah, I’m fine.” I didn’t even realize I was on the ground. I grumbled in embarrassment. “It happens, here let me help you up.” She said, extending her hand. “Oh my! What happened to your face? Did someone here hurt you?” She gasped. “What?! Oooh, nothing. I’m just very clumsy, as you can see, I wasn’t paying attention and got hit by a door.” I tried to explain but the look on her face told her that she didn’t believe me. “If you’ll excuse me…"" I started to say. “Here, try this.” She said handing me a bottle of cover up. “C’mon, let's see if we can get this covered.” She offered. “Thanks.” I sighed as we walked into the lady’s room, and the girl applied the cover up. “By the way my name is Stormie.” I smiled faintly. “Nice to meet you, Stormie.” She smiled back at me. “I’m Summer SilverMoon, I just transferred, so today is my first day.” She replied, stood back, and admired her work. “There all covered up.” She turned me to look in the mirror. “Whoa!” I gasped. Whatever she did, she was able to cover every single bruise and cut. I need to ask her how to do that. “Thank you. I really appreciate it.” I softly said. “No problem. Would you tell me who did this to you?” She asked. I stood there in silence, no one ever asked me about my bruises. They always walked by and ignored me. “I know we just met but if you ask for help, I can help you.” Summer offered. I wanted to ask for help, but I was scared. I knew that Fred would never let me go, he would follow me to the end of the world if he had to.

When Summer realized that I wasn’t going to answer her she changed the subject. “So, what class are you going to? Ethics with Mr. Sheridan.” “Hey me too!” She said with excitement. “But he’s not the instructor anymore.” She said as we walked into the classroom. “What? He’s been teaching since the semester started.” I frowned. “Yeah, rumor is that he was in a car accident over the weekend, so there’s a new instructor.” She explained. How did I not know this? I asked myself. Oh yeah, three 3-year-old little terrors, my little terrors. I have no time for anything else outside of them, right now, they are my life. We walked into the classroom, and I started making my way to my normal seat at the top of the room. Summer tugged at my arm and led me to the second-row corner seats. I shook my head no. I didn’t like sitting so close, it was easier for me to stay invisible, especially when I had bruises to hide. “Summer, I’m gonna go sit up there, these seats are just too close to the front.” I said pointing to my regular seat and lowering my head. “No, please sit with me. I can’t see the board from way up there and you’re the only person I know.” Summer pouted. I groaned, I hate pouting, the triplets do it all the time, Summer reminded me of them. “Don’t pout!” I groaned at her. She kept her pout going and gave puppy dog eyes. “Uuggg…fine, okay.” I grumbled and Summer squealed in delight. I shook my head and settled into my seat as the rest of the class started making their way in. I got a few glances and stares, but I just kept my head down and chatted with Summer.

“Oh, my Goddess!” A shrill voice came from behind us. Have you seen our new instructor?! She excitedly asked her friend. I rolled my eyes. “I got a peek at him and the other guy as I passed by his office on my way here.” She smirked. “They are both beyond hot and they don’t even look that much older than us. I am so going to love getting into his pants.” She smirked as she adjusted her boobs. “Such whores.” Summer snorted and I snorted out a laugh. “Excuse you! No one was talking to you or asked for your opinion. You and the invisible girl need to mind your own business.” She spit back at us. “I can say whatever I want.” “You’re the one telling the whole class what you’re THINKING will happen. I’m not here to listen to your wanna be conquests. This is not a dating service; this is a place of higher education. If you’re just here to find your mate, then I think you’re in the wrong place.” Summer coolly said. Wait?! Did Summer just say mate? This is the second time I’ve heard that word MATE, is it like the Australian people use the word MATE. I’ll have to remember to ask her about that later. “Oh puh-lease, you’re just jealous.” The girl said looking at her manicured fingers. “We can get any guy we want anytime we want.” She bragged. Summer snorted so hard that she blew her coffee out her nose. “Me jealous? Of you?” Summer snorted wiping her face. Storm couldn’t help but laugh at the whole situation and when she finally got herself together she said, “Yeah sure, keep telling yourself that Barbie doll. The only guys you will get are little boys, not MEN.” Summer said.

I was still giggling when the most amazing scent hit my nose, sandalwood, and fresh cut grass. A small, low whimper escaped my lips, OH DAMN. I hoped that no one heard that. I looked towards the door where the scent was coming from. Oh, my dear heavenly skittles, it’s him, the Greek God I bumped into this morning. He lifted his nose like he is sniffing the air and looked around, his eyes shifted to pitch black as we locked eyes. We stared at each other for a few seconds before he broke eye contact licking his bottom lip. All I could feel was a shiver run down my spine. Why didn’t his scent hit me earlier? I have no idea what’s going on but whatever it is, I can’t… let myself have feelings for anyone. Fred will kill him and me. “Hey. you, okay?” Summer nudged me. “Huh? Yeah, I’m good.” I said, feeling my face blush. “Looks like someone has the hots for the teacher.” Summer sniggered. The girl behind us leaned into my ear and said, “don’t even think about it, he’s mine. Besides, why would he want a nobody like you? He’s not gonna want to be stuck with a single mom with three little monsters.” I could feel my anger rising, my jaw clenched, and my hands balled into tight fists. I was ready to beat the shit outta this skank, she needs to stay away from him. Before I could do anything else, I felt a presence next to me. “Is there a problem, ladies?” He asked in his smooth and husky voice, for some reason, just the sound of his voice helped calm and soothe me. How is that even possible? “No, no problem prof.” Summer commented glaring at the girls behind her. “Well, please be respectful in my class ladies. This classroom will be treated as a professional work atmosphere just as if you are in an actual business setting.” He said but more to the skanks sitting behind us. “I would hate to hafta treat you like children but I’m going to ask you two to take seats on the other side of the room.” I started to gather my things. “No, not you two but the two behind you.” He said motioning to the skanks. “What?! Why?!” Skank number one asked with surprise. “But, but…” She stammered out. “Please, go take your new seats, we need to get class started. And those will be your regular seats from now on.” He announced. “The seats you are in will be your assigned seats and the person to your right will be your assigned partner. If no one is sitting next to you or you don’t have a partner by the end of class, see me during my office hours.” He said as he made his way down to the podium. “We’ve never had assigned seats!” Skank one grumbled. “Well, this is my class now, and I assign seats.” He told her raising an eyebrow at her.

Summer chuckled and sent a small wave bye to them. I took my seat, and I could feel him watching me from the corner of his eye. I would steal a few glances at him and the last time I did, he caught me, he smiled and threw a quick wink at me. Oh, cheese and crackers, my panties are in trouble. I can’t let this happen! Fred would kill me; he’s never going to let me go. He’s already told me, that’s why I’ve NEVER been on a date. I don’t even want to think about what would happen, who would take care of the triplets. I have to stay away from him, somehow. I just don’t know how or if I can do that, I’m drawn to him, but I have no idea why? He started his lecture, but I wasn’t really listening, I’m glad that I had a small recorder set up. I was so caught up in my own thoughts, the what if’s, the can not’s, the why can’t my life be different, why couldn’t I have a normal family life. Am I ever going to be happy? Am I ever going to fall in love and have a family of my own? What about my siblings, will they grow up happy? Or will they be condemned to a life of hell with Fred and our mom.

Yeah, some mother she is. After my dad died, she lost it. I was ten when my dad died, my world fell apart and I thought that my mom and me would get through it together, but she would go out and be gone for hours and then eventually she’d be gone for days at a time. I knew right then and there that I was on my own. Nancy packed us up the day after dad’s funeral and we moved to some decrepit house across the country so, I had no other family to turn to, I had to grow up quickly. A few months later mom came home and told me that she’s pregnant and the father of the baby would be living with them. He just had to be near his child and his female, as he called her. Mom was never the same after she got together with Fred, it’s like she was under some spell of his that wouldn’t let her go. We had no idea that she was having triplets until the day they were born. They were squishy little things, but I fell in love with them immediately. They were my family, and I was never going to let anything happen to them.

“Storm. Hey hello. Earth to Stormie.” I heard Summer as she snapped her fingers in front of my face. “Huh, what?” I said coming out of my daze. “Where did you go?” She chuckled. “Sorry. Just getting lost in my own thoughts.” I shrugged. “I’ve been told that I’m a pretty good listener.” She says with a comforting smile. “Thanks, but I don’t want to burden you with my problems.” I shrugged my shoulders. “It’s not a bother. It’ll be good to let it all out. If you let it sit and fester, you may end up snapping and then you will be committed, and I would have to break you out and we would be on the run with your three little monsters. Way too much drama so, let’s just grab lunch at the café and talk.” She suggested with a chuckle. I let out a small snort. I know she meant nothing bad when she called the triplets little monsters. “Uh, no, not the café. I had a rather embarrassing moment there.” I scrunch my nose. Summer giggled. “When and where do you not have an embarrassing moment?” She snickered. “Hey.” I laughed, nudging Summer with my elbow. “Excuse me, Miss…” I looked up and low and behold it’s my Greek God. I was at a loss of words, “wholly shitzu! What’s my name? I can’t remember my name!” I heard muffled laughing in the back of mind. After a few seconds, I finally remembered my name and found my voice, maybe. “S-Storm, m-my n-name is S-St-Storm Hawk.” I stuttered out as Summer continued to cover her mouth trying not to laugh at me as I shoot her a death glare. “Well, Storm, please give me a few minutes, I would like to speak with you.” He said, giving me a small smile. I swallowed the big lump that formed in my throat. “Uuumm...o-okay.” I didn’t know what to say, all I wanted to do was run and hide. “Okay then, I will go grab our lunch and meet you in the quad.” Summer said flashing me a mischievous grin, giving me two thumbs up and wiggling her brows. I shook my head and rolled my eyes at her as she made her way out of the room. “Excuse me, Mr.…, I’m sorry I didn’t get your name.” Her shrill voice brought me back to attention making me cringe. “Actually, I don’t think I gave my name.” He said keeping a close eye on me. “Oh, well anyway, I wanted to invite you for a drink to apologize for my earlier behavior.” Skank said, giving me a snide smile. “Actually, I think you owe Ms. Hawk and the rest of the class an apology for your behavior and taking up their class time. Not to mention for calling her children…” he looked at me and squinted “…little monsters. Do you know them? Do you know for a fact that they are little monsters?” He scolded her like I would the triplets. I couldn’t help myself, but I threw a smirk at the skank. I couldn’t believe I just did that; I’ve never done that before; it would usually end up with me being slapped across the face. Fred would definitely punish me if he found out. So as quickly as the smirk appeared, it disappeared.

SYNOPSIS:

By the year 2030, America’s addiction to sugar has sparked global alarm. Countries begin banning U.S. food imports due to rising evidence of neurological and developmental disorders linked to its sweeteners. Japan acts first, cutting ties entirely.

The U.S. government doesn’t reform, it rebrands. Sugar is banned outright. Sweetness becomes shameful. And in the vacuum, the industry evolves.

Enter NuGen Sweet 2.0. A synthetic sugar substitute that doesn’t rot teeth, doesn’t spike insulin, and is chemically “neutral.” It’s a miracle, and for several years, it actually works.

But that wasn’t enough.

In the race to profit, biotech conglomerates push further, unleashing NuGen Sweet 3.7. A version marketed as not only safe, but nutritious. What the public doesn’t know is that once ingested, NuGen 3.7 bonds with the microplastics already present in human bodies. And in children, this triggers something catastrophic: a virus that mutates into a synthetic cancerous parasite.

The result is horrifying. Children across the country begin to change.

Sunlight burns their skin. Their blood glows under UV light. Their minds fragment and rewire. They vanish, then reappear, transformed into hive-minded, erratic predators. Dubbed Glitterkids, these infected children are frozen in time, their skin dusted in iridescent flakes. They don’t sleep. They don’t age. And they don’t stop.

In adults, if infected by a Glitterkid the infection is slower, more insidious. Killing them from the inside with cancers, lesions, and neurological decay.

The government blames everything but NuGen. Japan. Bioterrorism. A freak mutation. Anything to keep the population calm. But the truth is worse: NuGen Sweet wasn’t just a bad idea,  it was a weapon. And now it’s loose.

At the center of the chaos is Toshi Takahashi, a stoic Japanese-American teenager whose parents were among the few U.S. scientists trying to stop NuGen. His father has vanished. His mother is dead. And all that remains is an encrypted flash drive filled with incomplete cure research.

Toshi sets out across a glitter-infected wasteland to reach a rumored government outpost known only as The Initiate, hoping to complete the research and stop the spread. But he’s not alone:

Harper – a hammer-wielding former rich girl with trauma buried under sarcasm.

Reed – a semi-alcoholic ex-teacher still grading people on effort.

Marla – Reed’s emotionally volatile partner with serious impulse issues.

Raven Darkmoor – a trenchcoat-wearing LARPer who never breaks character and might be their most competent killer.

Calder – a hyper-pragmatic ex–special forces sniper with battlefield triage skills and zero tolerance for BS.

The Van – a sentient bioflesh vehicle designed as a mobile data courier. It’s warm, glitchy, and borderline human — until a forced OTA update wipes its personality and gives it one mission: locate the cure, or eliminate Toshi.


As they battle through infested ruins and government deception, Toshi decrypts the drive, but realizes the data is too vulnerable. To keep it safe, he uploads the remaining cure sequence into the last place any algorithm would search: Harper’s corrupted Shrek 2 DVD.

From that point on, the Van pretends to be their ally, all while sabotaging their progress and relaying their location to government satellites. Meanwhile, the Glitterkids are evolving. Organizing. And there’s something at the center of the hive. A voice, a source, a mind, learning from every failed assault.

The final stretch is brutal. One of the group members is infected. Marla unravels. Harper begins to fall for Toshi, but suspects he’s hiding something that could destroy them. And the Van, once their safe haven, becomes their most intimate threat.

Dead S.H.U.G.A.R. is a genre-blending series built for TV. A grotesque, emotionally grounded road trip that collides horror, absurdist humor, and political satire. One moment you're laughing at a van misprocessing trauma like a broken GPS, and the next, you’re sobbing as a ten-year-old Glimmer reaches for the sun, trying to remember her name before she burns.

At its core, it asks:
How do you stay sane in a world where joy has been weaponized?

Each episode peels back another layer of the infection, the cover-up, and the broken people trying to fix it.

And in the end…
Sugar was never just sugar.
It was silence.
It was survival.
It was control.



________

What I’m Looking For:

Does the story make sense overall?

Do the tone and worldbuilding feel cohesive?

Does the dark humor land, or feel too much?

Any scenes that felt slow, confusing, or repetitive?

Is this something you’d want to binge as a series if Adaptated?



_______

Critique Swap:
Yes, I’m down to swap first chapters or full feedback depending on your availability.


_______

Preferred Timeline:
Over the next few weeks (June–July). Flexible!

________


Author’s note for beta readers:
Although Dead S.H.U.G.A.R. opens as straight horror-suspense, the dark-comedy tone doesn’t kick in until the transition between Chapters 4 & 5. The shift is intentional. I’d love feedback on whether that tonal pivot feels surprising in a good way or jarring.

Chapter 1: The Last Sweet Thing


The battlefield was buckling.


Smoke and glitter swirled through the air like a curse. Screams overlapped gunfire. Marla shouted, “This isn’t normal!” as her gun clicked dry.


Then—


“HEY!!”


Toshi spun.


A goddamn moped roared out of the forest, caked in blood and glitter. Atop it: Quinn. Alive. Barely.


He skidded to a stop, jumped off, eyes blazing with fury and something heavier. He pointed his weapon at Reed. “FUCK YOU!” he spat, voice shredded. Then turned to Toshi, and everything in him deflated.


“The only reason I’m still alive… is because of you. And Harper.”


Toshi stepped forward. “Why weren’t they attacking you?”


Quinn’s voice dropped to a whisper. “Because once you’re infected… they think you’re one of them.”


Before anyone could process it, another wave hit—

Hard. Fast. Endless.


Quinn fought beside them, unleashing chemical fire. Jared screamed as he held his hands over his ears


Then Quinn saw Jared. Saw what he was.

And made a choice.


“Tell them I’m one of you,” he shouted.

Jared hesitated, then nodded.


The moment the infected twitched and paused, Quinn was gone.


He rode.


Straight into the horde.

No words. No glory. Just motion.

They followed.


Thousands.


Over the ridge. A waterfall of infected chasing him into the abyss.


Silence.


without warning—


ROOOOOAAAAAARRRRR.


The second wave.

Ten times the size.

A wall of glittered death.


Toshi screamed, “HOLD THE LINE!”

They did. Barely.


And high above, the van battled something monstrous.


A Phase Two.


The world was ending. Again.


Screams tore through smoke. UV blasts lit the dusk like broken camera flashes. Infected bodies slammed into the barricades. Too many, too fast. Glittering skin writhing, twitching, snarling.


Gunfire spat from every direction, but it wasn’t enough.


“WHAT DO WE DO?!” Marla shrieked.


“WE’RE FUCKING SURROUNDED!” Reed yelled, swinging at shadows.


“WE NEED A WAY OUT! NOW!” Tasha bellowed, already cleaving through another child-sized blur of fangs and glitter.


Logan charged forward like a human battering ram. Harper backed into Toshi’s side, hammer raised, eyes wild.


But Calder didn’t move.


Across the battlefield, he just looked at Toshi.


Didn’t shout. Didn’t panic.


Just looked.


That was worse.


His eyes said what no one else would: We’re not gonna make it.


In an instant—


Everything slowed.


Sound warped. The battlefield blurred, smeared into static and chaos. Gunshots muffled into thuds. Screams stretched into distant echoes. It all fell away.


Except the memories.


Toshi’s mind split open like a cracked vault.


His father’s eyes. His mother’s voice. The sterile halls of a lab he wasn’t supposed to see. His own hands trembling over the Shrek DVD. The flash of Tokyo rooftops. The smell of rain. A simpler time. Before everything melted. Before NuGen. Before the glitter turned lethal.


Before America.

Before… 


Then to when all this mess started


_ _

December 8th, 2030.


The world was drowning in sugar.


In America, processed sweetness had become a second currency. Poured into everything from bread to baby formula. The shelves overflowed with frosted cereals and hyper-caffeinated energy gummies, all wrapped in biodegradable lies. Obesity rates skyrocketed. Heart disease claimed younger victims every year. Dental clinics became emergency rooms. Children were being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes before they could spell it.


Japan was the first to act.


They officially cut off all food imports from the United States. They'd still export. Soybeans, seaweed, clean proteins. But nothing came in. Not after what they'd seen.


America, humiliated and in crisis, did what it always did when backed into a corner.


It rebranded.


Sugar was banned across the board.


Refined white, brown, raw, corn syrup, gone. Most artificial sweeteners too, pulled off shelves for being carcinogenic, gut-corrosive, or worse. The nation entered a bitter age of withdrawal. Bakeries closed. Candy factories shuttered. Coffee shops handed out salt packets instead of Splenda. People got mean.


The sugar companies?


They weren't having it.


With profits collapsing, they funneled billions into private experimental labs. Quiet deals were made with bio-agencies and neurochemical startups. Within eighteen months, the first breakthrough arrived: a new kind of sweetener.


Not nutritious.


But not harmful either.


It didn't rot teeth. Didn't spike insulin. Didn't clog arteries or feed tumors. It just... tasted good. Pure. Clean. And after five long years of life without sweetness, America devoured it.


Headlines followed.


""Sweet Savior? GenMod's Breakthrough Sugar Hits Shelves Nationwide""


""New 'Clean Sugar' Boosts Economy by 18% in First Quarter""


""Cupcakes Back on School Menus! FDA Declares NuGen Sweet 1.0 'Miracle Safe'""


""Obesity Drops, Mood Rise, Coincidence?""


Fast food chains rolled out revamped menus overnight. Coffee shops doubled their drive-thru numbers. Schools handed out ""Victory Snacks"" with lunchtime. One cereal company launched an entire campaign around it. ""Crispy Clean: Now With Guilt-Free Sweet!""


The people? They loved it.


The bitterness, the bans, the years of bland substitutes, all forgiven in a single bite.


The compound's name was NuGen Sweet.


Its nickname on the streets? God Dust.


But not everyone celebrated.


Japan outlawed it almost immediately. Citing ""unknown molecular behavior"" and ""neurological interference patterns,"" they not only banned production. They declared it illegal for import or personal use. Scientists issued warnings. Lawmakers called it overreach.


America didn't care.


For the first time in years, the economy was climbing, smiles were wide, and birthday cakes were back on the table.


But they didn't stop there.


NuGen Sweet was just the start.


The next version, NuGen Sweet 2.0 wasn't just neutral. It was healthy.


Through a series of rushed but wildly successful experiments, bioengineers embedded vitamins, minerals, and slow-release nutrients directly into the sweetener's molecular structure. Now, you could eat a slice of cake and get your recommended daily fiber. A Snickers bar could boost your immune system. A bag of gummy bears? Protein-enhanced. Antioxidant-rich. Heart-healthy.


And it still tasted exactly like sugar.


The world went wild.


Countries that had previously hesitated began lining up for exports. Canada approved it within a week. India rolled out government-subsidized ""clean sweets"" for public schools. Germany installed vending machines stocked with vitamin candy in hospitals. Supermarkets in France ran out of stock by noon.


Except Japan.


They locked down even harder. No imports or even exports, no exceptions, no foreign visitors. The government issued new internal advisories labeling the compound as ""neurologically invasive."" They shut their borders completely.


America didn't blink.


Neither did Mexico, after the scientists released regional flavors with  Nugen 3.7: a fortified salt version, and a viral new blend called Chamoy-X and Tajin Clear, which swept across Latin America in a marketing wave powered by spicy mango lollipops and glitter-dusted tamarind.


Within a year, NuGen Industries became a multi-billion dollar empire.


Sweetness had won.


And the world had never been happier.


But not everyone was celebrating.


Japan issued one last warning.


A quiet, unpolished video appeared online. No fancy editing. No flashy marketing. Just a scientist in a gray lab coat behind a desk, speaking with tired eyes and a translator's subtitle bar below:


""This compound does not metabolize. It integrates. Your bodies may accept it, but your minds will not remain unchanged.""


It barely made headlines.


The next day, the video was gone.


Fact-checked. Debunked. Buried.


And across the world, the sweetness continued.


They called it the sweetest era in history.


3 Years Later


NuGen Memorial Week.

Pastel banners fluttered across every city, stamped with smiling fruit mascots and sugary slogans like:

“Out With the Rot, In With the Future!”


Every school cafeteria served the same thing:

One flawless cupcake.

Its frosting shimmered like oil on water. Almost holographic.

The wrapper read:

NuGen Sweet 3.7

“Naturally Healthy. Artificially Perfect.”


Jared Davis, age nine, didn’t care about slogans.

He just wanted sugar.


He stared at the cupcake like it might blink.

It looked... too perfect.

Photoshopped into existence.

The frosting held its swirl. The cake didn’t crumble.

It smelled like birthday candles and cereal commercials.


At the front of the classroom, Ms. Trask beamed like she’d witnessed a holy event.


“This is history, kids,” she said, hands clasped. “No more cavities. No more crashes. You could eat five and your dentist would thank you!”


She turned dramatically, pointing at the glittery banner over the whiteboard:


HAPPY NUGEN MEMORIAL WEEK!


“This week’s about remembering how far we’ve come,” she said. “Just a decade ago, sugar was poison. It made you sick. Sad. Tired. But look at us now.”


She held up a sparkling cupcake like a trophy.


“NuGen changed everything.”


A few students clapped.

Most were already halfway through their desserts, barely listening.


“Oh! And don’t forget, your NuGen Week projects are due in two weeks,” Ms. Trask chirped. “You’ll each give a presentation on the Old Sugar Era. Causes, symptoms, consequences... get creative!”


A groan rippled through the room like static.

Jared slumped forward with the rest of them.

“Booooring,” someone muttered.


In the back, a hand rose.


It was the new kid. Quiet, always watching.

Toshi.

Transferred from Osaka last semester.


“What was old sugar like?” he asked softly, his accent careful and precise.


Ms. Trask blinked. Caught off guard.

“Well... it was sweet, of course. But not like this. Not clean. It made people... worse. Angry. Sick. It tricked your brain.”


Toshi frowned. “Then why did everyone eat it?”


She hesitated. Her smile stiffened.

“Because they didn’t know better. But we do now.”


Her gaze drifted to his untouched tray.


“Sweetheart, it’s NuGen Memorial Week,” she said gently, though her tone had sharpened. “Go ahead and try your cupcake. That’s what this is all about.”


Toshi shook his head. “My parents don’t allow sugar.”


A wave of giggles rippled through the class.

Someone snorted.

Whispers. Smirks.


Then one kid said it out loud:

“It’s ‘cause he’s from Japan. They think the frosting has trackers in it.”


“Mr. Palmer!” Ms. Trask snapped. Not outraged, just annoyed.


She turned back to Toshi. “Why don’t your parents let you eat sugar?”


Toshi sat straighter.

“Not just sugar. Any NuGen products. In Japanese culture, we believe these foods aren’t fully studied. They may harm the brain. Change how you think.”


Her nostrils flared. Smile gone.


“Well, that’s... not accurate. I think your parents might be feeding you some conspiracy theories. I’ll speak with the counselor. Kids deserve to be kids.”


She leaned in, lowering her voice like it was a kindness.

“You’re safe here. One bite won’t hurt.”


Toshi didn’t move. “No, thank you.”


Her lips pressed into a line.

“Suit yourself.”


She moved on.


Jared had watched the whole thing.

His eyes drifted back to his cupcake.

It looked... different now. Still glittering. Still perfect.

But for a second, he hesitated.


Then the laughter started again.

Whispers. Eyes shifting. All on Toshi.


Jared didn’t want to be that kid.


He took a bite.


The lunchroom was loud.


Trays slammed. Wrappers crinkled. The air was thick with the smell of chili mac and artificially sweetened applesauce.


Jared sat with his usual group near the center of the cafeteria, half-laughing at a joke he hadn’t heard, when he caught sight of Toshi.


Alone. As always.


Toshi unpacked his lunch with quiet precision: rice, pickled vegetables, two small egg rolls, and something Jared didn’t recognize. It looked... real. Homemade. Not a cartoon mascot in sight.


Then Tanner Palmer showed up.


The tray hit the table with a thud as Tanner dropped into the seat across from Toshi. “What even is that?” he sneered. “Radioactive fish shit?”


Toshi looked up calmly. “It’s tamagoyaki. With onigiri. Not radioactive.”


“Ohhh,” Tanner mocked, clutching his chest. “Look at me, I know words that ain’t English.”


Toshi blinked. “Japanese is spoken by over 120 million people. It’s a globally recognized language.”


Tanner’s nostrils flared.


Without warning, he leaned sideways and launched a snot rocket straight into Toshi’s lunch.


Gasps.


Jared jolted halfway out of his seat.


Toshi didn’t flinch. He calmly closed his lunchbox and said, “Psychological studies suggest children who bully others often experience instability at home, low self-esteem, or displaced anger from parental neglect. It’s not your fault.”


Tanner’s jaw clenched. “What’d you say, freak?”


He yanked a NuGen candy bar from his pocket and unwrapped it with a snap. “Eat it,” he growled. “Right now. Or I break your nose.”


“Hey!” Jared’s voice cracked, but he didn’t back down. “Leave him alone.”


Tanner turned, unimpressed. “What, you his translator now?”


Jared stood taller. “Just… back off.”


A beat of silence.

Then Tanner scoffed, rolled his eyes, and stalked off, muttering something about “teacher’s pets.”


Jared hovered a second longer, unsure what to do, then awkwardly sat beside Toshi.


Toshi gave him a quiet nod and pulled a napkin from his backpack to clean the mess.


Jared didn’t speak. Didn’t need to.


When he returned to his table, his friends were staring.


“You gonna sit with him tomorrow too?” one snorted.


Another mock-bowed. “Thank you, Sensei Jared, protector of weird lunchboxes.”


Jared rolled his eyes but didn’t respond.


He just picked at his food in silence, as the noise of the cafeteria dulled around him


After lunch, the kids shuffled into their last class of the day, stomachs full, brains checked out.


Ms. Trask stood at the door, hands folded.

“Toshi,” she said as he entered. “The counselor would like to speak with you.”


He nodded once, adjusting the strap on his backpack. Calm as ever.

No one looked up. A few whispered.

Jared watched him go but stayed quiet.


The counselor’s office was warm. Too warm.


Soft pastels. Overly cheerful posters. The kind of space trying too hard to feel safe.


Behind the desk sat a woman with kind eyes and a practiced smile.

“Hi, Toshi. I’m Ms. Carlin. Mind if we talk for a minute?”


Toshi nodded, taking a seat without hesitation.


“I just wanted to check in,” she began gently, like she was reading to a toddler. “Your teacher said you didn’t want your cupcake today. And that’s okay! But she mentioned your parents don’t let you have sugar?”


Toshi nodded. “NuGen products as a whole.”


Ms. Carlin tilted her head, concern pinching her smile.

“Can you help me understand why, sweetheart? Sometimes when kids aren’t allowed things, especially something as normal as a treat, it can be a sign something else is going on at home. Sometimes adults pass down fears that aren’t true.”


Toshi answered calmly. “My parents believe the long-term effects of NuGen compounds haven’t been adequately studied. Japan has peer-reviewed studies suggesting neurological changes and altered prefrontal development in children. Until there’s more conclusive data, we abstain.”


Ms. Carlin blinked.

“Well… the FDA and our government have declared it safe. Their studies are thorough.”


Toshi tilted his head. “The same government that approved red dye 40 and trans fats?”


No sass. Just facts.


“I just want to be healthy,” he added.


Ms. Carlin’s smile returned, tighter now.

“Well, I still think I’ll give Mr. and Mrs. Takahashi a call. Just to chat, alright?”


Toshi nodded. “Yes, ma’am.”


She handed him a sticker that read You’re Doing Great! and he returned to class.


The bus ride home was worse.


Toshi sat near the front, hugging his backpack, too close to the driver to be safe from the whispers. Or the flicked crumbs. Or the paper balls bouncing off his seat.


One kid mocked his accent every time he glanced back.

Another whispered, “Border boy,” and cracked up.


Toshi didn’t flinch. He never did.


Mid-route, Tanner leaned into the aisle.

“Hey genius,” he muttered, loud enough for everyone. “Think you’re better than us ‘cause your mom packs you rice balls and conspiracy theories?”


Jared stood up, gripping the back of a seat. “Leave him alone.”


Tanner smirked. “Here comes the sugar savior again.”


From the back: “Oooh, Jared’s in love.”


Laughter rolled through the bus.


Jared sat down, red-faced.

But he didn’t move away from Toshi.


When the bus hissed to a stop in front of a small, tidy house, neat hedges, no lawn ornaments, Toshi stood.


As he passed, Tanner bumped his shoulder.

“Souvenir,” he whispered.


Toshi didn’t look back.


The door opened.

He stepped into the golden light of his front yard and disappeared inside.


Behind him, wedged into the side pocket of his backpack, a NuGen candy bar slid deeper.


Unnoticed.


When Toshi stepped through the front door, the house was thick with the fermented tang of kimchi and the low murmur of the evening news.


In the kitchen, his mother packed her night-shift bento with quick, practiced hands. Pickled radish, seasoned spinach, each in its proper compartment. His father leaned against the counter, sipping tea from a chipped mug, steam curling toward the ceiling.


""I'm telling you,"" his mother said in Japanese, ""four more today. Younger than yesterday. Angry, twitchy, couldn't focus. One bit a nurse.""


""More glitter cases?"" his father asked, not looking up.


""Same symptoms. They blame crafts. Nail polish. Always something. But it's in them. The glitter, you can see it behind their eyes.""


The door clicked shut behind Toshi.


Both parents turned.

“Tadaima,” he said quietly.

“Okaeri,” his mother replied, smiling. “How was school?”


“It was okay.”


“Any new friends yet?”


He paused. “Not really. But… there was this boy. Jared. He said hi.”


Her smile warmed. “That’s good. I’m glad.”


She closed her bento, kissed her husband’s cheek, and turned to Toshi.

“Go wash up and start your homework. Dinner’ll be ready after I leave.”


Toshi nodded, dropped his backpack by the door, and headed upstairs.


The backpack slumped to one side.

Something slid out.


A NuGen candy bar hit the floor with a soft thud.


His father stared at it like it was ticking.


Ten minutes later, Toshi came back down. Hair damp, sleeves rolled.

His father was waiting in the center of the living room.


Arms crossed.

Eyes unreadable.

The candy bar sat alone on the coffee table.


“I got a call from your school,” he said, voice low. “And I found this in your bag.”


Toshi froze.


There was no yelling. No raised voice.


Just silence.


Heavy.

Suffocating.

His father’s disappointment filled the room like smoke.


“You have some explaining to do.”


By the time Toshi sat down with his father, the house had gone still.


Two neighborhoods over, Jared’s home was chaos.


The TV blared. One brother shouted at a game, the other raided the fridge for the third time. A chair scraped. A door slammed. Jared sat at the kitchen table trying to finish a math worksheet while his mom shuffled through a pile of bills, pen tapping faster by the second.


“School okay?” she asked, not looking up.


“Yeah. Pretty normal.”


“Any trouble?”


He hesitated. “There was this kid. Toshi. He got picked on.”


That made her pause.


“He’s quiet. Doesn’t talk much. Some kids were jerks, so I told them to back off.”


She looked up and smiled. “That’s good, honey. I’m proud of you. That’s how I raised you.”


Jared smiled, then hesitated again. “He said he doesn’t eat sugar.”


Her smile dropped. “What do you mean? Allergic?”


“No. His parents won’t let him. He said NuGen messes with your brain.”


She closed the bill folder slowly.


“What?” Jared asked.


“Nothing, just…” She sighed. “Sweetheart, that boy might be nice, but it sounds like his family believes some strange things. All that online conspiracy junk.”


“But what if he’s right?” Jared asked.


“No,” she said sharply, then softened, but her voice stayed edged. “Don’t start thinking like that. People like that… cause problems. I don’t want you hanging around him.”


Jared looked down at his worksheet. The numbers suddenly wouldn’t stay still.



--


Toshi stood silently in the living room, hands at his sides. The NuGen bar lay on the coffee table, its wrapper glinting like a warning.


His father stared at it. “What is this?”


“I don’t know,” Toshi said.


“You don’t lie.”


“I’m not lying. It’s not mine.”


“Then how did it get in your bag?”


“I don’t know.”


His father exhaled through his nose, slow and tired. “Your school called. I explained our rules. They may not understand, but we do. We came here for your mother’s job, not to change who we are.”


“I know,” Toshi said softly. “And I am telling the truth.”


His father studied him.


Toshi turned to leave, then stopped.


Souvenir.


Tanner’s voice echoed. The shoulder bump. The smug look.


“…Someone put it in my bag,” Toshi said quietly.


His father’s gaze sharpened. “Who?”


“Just… a boy.”


“You’re being bullied.”


“No. I—”


“You’re embarrassed.”


Silence.


“You’re afraid I’ll think you’re weak.”


More silence.


“Toshi. Tell me the truth.”


Toshi swallowed. “Some kids say things. About me. About Japan. About not eating NuGen.”


His father stood and placed a steady hand on his son’s shoulder.


“You are not weak. You are different. That’s not the same.”


He held his gaze.


“There will always be people who don’t understand you. Who refuse to. They’ll confuse quiet for weakness, intelligence for arrogance, culture for defiance.”


Toshi nodded slowly.


“Don’t shrink to make them comfortable. You know what’s right. You know who you are.”


His father stepped back, gentler now. “Go finish your homework. Dinner will be ready soon. And collect your gear—archery class is tomorrow.”


Upstairs, Toshi sat on the edge of his bed.


His room was quiet. Tidy. A soft paper lantern glowed on his desk. The backpack sat zipped against the wall, but still felt wrong.


He didn’t cry. Didn’t break.


He sat straight, breathing slow, staring at the floor.


Outside, the streetlights flickered on, casting long shadows across the walls.


Toshi didn’t move.



---


Across town, the flickering light of a crumbling apartment cast crooked patterns over peeling wallpaper.


Unit 4C’s door was cracked open. Inside: chaos.


Tanner sat on the couch, tearing the wrapper from a second NuGen candy bar. The cartoons on TV blared, but he wasn’t watching.


In the kitchen, crashing, shouting.


“Maybe if you actually worked, Reed, we wouldn’t be living like rats!”


“Maybe if you weren’t such a psycho, Marla, I wouldn’t have to get drunk just to breathe near you!”


Another crash. Another bottle.


Reed, shirtless and slurring. Marla, raccoon-eyed and chain-smoking rage.


Tanner didn’t flinch. Just chewed slowly.


He didn’t even like the candy.


But it made everything quieter.



---


At the hospital, fluorescent lights buzzed like insects.


Dr. Yumi Takahashi peeled off her surgical mask and leaned against the nurses’ station, eyes tired.


“Another one,” a nurse muttered, wheeling in a boy, maybe ten. Glitter clung to his shirt, his cheeks.


He screamed. Fought the restraints.


“GET OFF ME!”


His voice cracked. High, panicked, inhuman.


The chart clipped to the stretcher read:

Room 112. Agitation. Light Sensitivity. Delirium.


Yumi’s stomach sank. That was the third child in Room 112 tonight.


She turned to Melissa, the charge nurse.


“That’s the third.”


“Fifth, if you count psych,” Melissa replied. “Same symptoms. Rage. Hallucinations. Glitter.”


Yumi stepped to the glass window of Room 112. The boy now clawed at his arms like something moved beneath the skin.


Her expression didn’t change. But her grip on her pen tightened.


“No one’s tested the glitter?”


“We’re calling it craft exposure,” Melissa said. “No idea where it’s coming from.”


Yumi didn’t answer. She watched the boy’s reflection blur with her own in the glass.


A chill crawled up her spine.


Something was wrong. Deeply wrong.


That night, Dr. Yumi Takahashi slipped a sealed vial into her coat pocket. Just a speck of glitter inside. No one saw.


She told no one.

1lb2hvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMySpaceAI/comments/1lb2hvk/our_aidesigned_living_room_from_clutter_to_cozy/,Our AI-Designed Living Room: From Clutter to Cozy Family Hub!,"Hey r/DesignMySpaceAI community!

We recently helped a user who just moved into a new apartment with their 10-week-old baby. Their main goals were to create a comfy, aesthetic living room that also provided practical play stations for their little one. The existing furniture was a mix-and-match collection, so they were looking for a cohesive and functional design.

We tackled some specific requests and challenges:

**The Original Space:** The living room, while having potential, felt a bit thrown together with assorted furniture and baby items. The user specifically mentioned wanting to replace the current sofa with a sectional, get rid of a white chair and side table, and swap a mirrored coffee table for a soft, round ottoman. A key concern was also finding a new spot for keys once the black console table was removed from under the TV.

**What the AI Did:**

* **Sectional Sofa:** We introduced a large, comfortable sectional sofa in a neutral tone, providing ample seating and a cozy vibe perfect for family time. This immediately streamlined the main seating area.
* **Soft Ottoman:** As requested, the mirrored coffee table was replaced with a plush, round ottoman. This not only adds a soft, safe surface for a baby-friendly environment but also serves as a versatile piece for resting feet or placing a tray.
* **Integrated Storage & Baby Zones:** The existing white bookshelf was retained near the baby's play area, embracing the user's preference for accessible toy and book storage. The AI optimized its placement to blend seamlessly with the new design.
* **Strategic Console Table Placement:** Instead of removing the black console table entirely, the AI suggested a more integrated approach. By placing it under the TV, it becomes a functional media console. For key storage, we introduced a stylish basket or decorative tray on top of the console, keeping essentials organized and easily accessible.
* **Simplified Aesthetic:** The overall design aimed for a clean, minimalist aesthetic with warm, inviting tones. This creates a calm atmosphere while highlighting the functional elements. The previous clutter was eliminated, making the room feel more spacious and intentional.
* **Baby Play Area:** The AI ensured the baby's play mat and activity station were comfortably integrated into the design, making it a natural part of the living space rather than an afterthought.

> 
> The greenlight for the film came at a very synchronistic moment — an interview by Jesse Michaels of the now-late former Presidential to JFK, LBJ, Nixon and Ford, Harald Malmgren, who in this past year of his life began dropping jaw-dropping details of what he was told about the UAP crash-retrieval reverse-engineering program, dropped two hours before Michael and I were about to record our first joint interview detailing some of what we can reveal about the story of the Magenta UAP. In Malmgren’s interview with Michels, he talks at length about Magenta, the first time anyone had revealed any details about the story in an official capacity since Grusch revealed that it was the one case he’d gotten past the Pentagon’s DOPSR office, beyond what Michael and I and Geoff Cruikshank had revealed on Reddit. As we were watching Malmgren start talking about Magenta, our director Jon emailed us to tell us that we had the greenlight from our distributor, and now it was time to find funding. Meanwhile, our minds were being collectively warped watching a major figure in 20th Century political historical go over some of what we’d spent over a year putting together.

The wedding reached the ring exchange part, the screen suddenly displayed a high-definition video of me being kidnapped, beaten, and sexually violated.

My fiancé,Kieran Stark called off the wedding on the spot,immediately slipped the ring onto my best friend Athena's finger instead.

I fell from the red carpet amid the friends' curses and humiliation.

One of Athena's mafia boss friend,Declan Royce,caught me, had his security team silence the entire room with his command, and even bring in ten cases of cash, proposing to me in front of everyone.

Moved by his action, I said yes.

Three years later, the IVF finally succeeded. I was rushing to share the wonderful news with him when I overheard his conversation with his friends.

""Hey,bro, you're fucking brilliant!Releasing that video of Talia being kidnapped and sexually assaulted at the wedding was the only way Miss Athena could marry into the Stark family.""

Declan spun his lighter and said, ""A prestigious family like the Starks would never marry a woman who's been... used. Only after Talia was completely ruined could Athena rightfully become Mrs. Stark.""

His friend asked, confused, ""But Miss Athena has already married into the Stark family. Why the hell did you bother marrying this... slut woman?""

""Athena's afraid of pain. Perfect to use Talia's womb to give her a child. Once she delivers the Stark heir, Athena's position in the family will be solid.""

The waves of laughter from the private room made my blood run cold.

All those moments I thought were happiness—they were just part of Declan's elaborate con to squeeze every last drop of value from me.

All so Athena could climb to the top by stepping on my body.

Wiping away my tears, I dialed his rival's number""I've got a ten-billion-dollar deal. You interested?""

The mocking voices in the room continued.

""Damn, Declan, you're a genius. Switching that woman's vitamins with abortion pills—when she couldn't conceive naturally, she had to do IVF. If she knew that you'd already swapped out the embryo with Miss Athena and Kieran's kid... oh, she'd probably fuming.""

""What’s it to me? After she gives birth, I'll just make up some excuse about the baby dying. She'll think it's her own fault for not being able to keep the child. Being able to pave the way for Athena's happiness... that's her honor.""

Throwing his lighter onto the table, he stood up and warned everyone present, ""Not a single word of today's conversation leaves this room. I need her to deliver this baby without any trouble.""

Milo slapped his chest, laughing, ""Boss, don't worry. That woman's dumb as shit. We call her 'sister-in-law' and she actually thinks she's the lady of the house. Every day she brings us food and drinks... she has no clue that I personally handpicked every single guy who was in that video.""

Someone burst out laughing, ""Milo, you're such a bastard!Why didn't you pick me back then? I would've loved to have a taste of—""

A fruit knife suddenly flew across the room, embedding itself in the floor right between the man's legs.

The joker's face went pale with terror.

""Did I or did I not say that Talia is my fucking wife now? Anyone who dares bring up that shit again, I'll fucking kill them.""

One of his men sheepishly said, ""Boss, seems like you actually do care about her a bit. And that woman loves you so much... aren't you worried that someday she'll find out the truth and leave you?""

Declan scoffed dismissively, ""Worst case scenario, I'll just get her pregnant with another test tube baby and keep her for the rest life. She's just a foolish woman—give her a few sweet words and she'll come crawling back like a fucking dog.""

The private room erupted in laughter again. I stood at the door, feeling like I'd been struck by lightning.

I could only cover my mouth tightly.

Footsteps approached the door. I quickly turned and ran downstairs, poured myself a glass of wine, and downed it in one gulp.

The burning sensation shot straight to my head, and tears finally broke free.

I clutched my chest as those soul-crushing words echoed over and over in my mind.

A week before the wedding, I was suddenly kidnapped and endured a day and night that even like hell.

My fiancé Kieran held my hand tenderly, saying he loved me and still wanted to marry me.

But the wedding I'd been so excited for turned into a nightmare when that video of my assault played for everyone to see.

Kieran's abandonment turned me into a whore scorned by thousands.

It was Declan who burst in, smashed the giant screen, held me in his arms, and viciously drove back everyone's shame and curses.

He had people bring in ten cases of cash for me, saying he'd fallen in love with me long ago, and if he couldn't marry me in this lifetime, he'd never release.

It was his determined gaze that conquered me. Now he was telling me that everything he did was just to pave the way for Athena.

No wonder Athena looked at me with that strange smile on the wedding day.

I was kidnapped because Athena said her car broke down and asked me to pick her up.

She knew all along that all this was just a scheme Declan had set up for her.

She was laughing at my stupidity, even more pleased to have such a devoted backup ready to do anything for her.

And these three years of care and affection were just fake emotions Declan put on to squeeze every last drop of value from me.

Yet I mistook the damn demon for my savior. How fucking ridiculous!

My fingernails dug into my flesh as I gritted my teeth. Pain and hatred churned in my chest, and the tears just wouldn't stop.

A familiar scent drifted down from above.

Declan tenderly kissed the corners of my eyes, but his brow furrowed deeply as he cursed loudly for everyone to hear, ""Which bastard made my wife cry? I'll fucking kill him!""

The entire hall fell silent. Everyone was too terrified to even breathe.

Declan pulled out his gun and pressed it into my hands, wrapping his arms around me and guiding my grip as he swept it across everyone present, ""Baby, see anyone you don't like? Just shoot them. I'm got your back.""

Everyone he aimed at shook like leaves, but none dared to dodge.

In LA, Declan was the boss of one of the two biggest families. No one could afford to cross him.

When the gun stopped on Milo, I paused.

Milo's eyes went wide, his face white with terror.

That phrase 'I personally handpicked every single guy who was in that video' kept screaming in my ears like a curse.

My chest heaved violently. Just as I was about to pull the trigger with red eyes, the gun barrel was pushed down.

Chapter 2

""Honey, the doctor said your IVF was successful. Better not see blood right now—wouldn't want to scare the baby.""

He coaxed me gently, the concern in his eyes looking completely genuine.I almost couldn't help but applaud his fucking Oscar-worthy performance.

Noticing something was off with my mood, Declan spotted the drink glass in front of me and asked, squeezing my palm, ""Babe, how long have you been here? Why didn't you come upstairs to find me?""

There was careful probing hidden in his words.

I looked down and said flatly, ""You guys were talking business upstairs—with cigar and wine. I don't like that.""

He sighed in relief and patted my head, having a maid bring over some coffee.

Just as the maid handed over the coffee, he suddenly grabbed his gun and shoot at her head.

I didn't even have time to react. Thick blood splattered across my face as the maid's outstretched hand froze mid-gesture before she collapsed, eyes wide with shock.

My lips trembled as my stomach clenched uncontrollably.

Declan acted like nothing happened, setting down the gun and carefully wiping my face clean with his sleeve before feeding me the sobering coffee sip by sip.

I swallowed mechanically, my whole body shaking.

In my peripheral vision, Milo had someone drag the maid's body away.

A winding trail of blood stretched across the floor.

""Can't even take care of my wife properly—letting her drink is harming my son. No reason for her to keep breathing.""

I looked at his cold, vicious expression as my stomach churned violently.

Declan tenderly touched my face, ""It's all my fault for making you suffer so much. Now that we finally have a baby, no more alcohol, okay?""

""This child has to be born healthy no matter what, understand?""

I took several deep breaths before forcing out a dry smile, ""Okay.""

But my heart felt frozen with fear.

In three years of marriage, I'd been pregnant six times. Each time, I miscarried for no apparent reason.

After so many losses, it became habitual miscarriage.

Six months ago, the doctor declared I could never conceive again.

Declan held me lovingly, saying he didn't care about children—as long as I was happy and healthy.

I'd been tormented by guilt over not being able to give him a healthy child. After extensive research, I chose the difficult path of IVF.

My belly was riddled with needle holes, hormone pills taken by the handful.

All that suffering, and it was all just to benefit Athena.

Just because she was afraid of pain, I had to permanently lose my chance at motherhood and become nothing but a breeding machine.

""What's wrong? You look terrible. Are you feeling sick? I'll get a doctor here right away.""

""I'm fine, just a bit of morning sickness.""

Declan's eyes reddened with concern as he gently caressed my face, ""Honey, you're so tired. I wish I could bear this for you. We rushed into marriage back then—I've ordered your favorite imported wedding dress. Before you start showing, let's go try it on tomorrow.""

I stared at him steadily. Such loving eyes, treating me like a fool, lying to me again and again.

If he knew I had no intention of carrying this baby to term, I'd probably end up just like that maid.

I forced a smile, ""I'm going to rest. You guys keep talking.""

As soon as I got back to the room, I couldn't help but rush to the bathroom and vomit until my stomach twisted into knots.

Tears streamed down my face. The physical pain was nothing compared to even a fraction of the heartbreak.

After recovering for a while, I finally got up and came out, only to see Declan's phone left on the sofa.

As if possessed, I picked it up and tried Athena's birthday as the passcode. It unlocked on the first try.

The wallpaper was a photo of Athena leaning against his shoulder with a radiant smile.

I scrolled through the photo album.

Over five thousand photos, every single one featuring Athena.

He'd used four folders to save them, documenting different periods of Athena's life. Each word was labeled with just one character that together spelled out ""love.""

In their chat history, Declan had once risked his life to steal a queen's crown from Country A overnight.

I suddenly remembered that day—he came back with two bullet wounds, nearly didn't make it. I had to trade my mother's only keepsake, a priceless diamond, to get him back from the royal family.

All because Athena mentioned wanting to feel like a queen at her 25th birthday party.

Tears fell onto the screen as my heart felt like it was being carved up.

Not from the pain of years of deception, but because for such a demon who destroyed me, I'd even sacrificed the only item my mother left me.

Through blurred vision, my eyes fell on the crescent-shaped birthmark on Athena's right shoulder, and I gasped in shock.

I had an identical birthmark in the exact same spot on my right shoulder.

I remembered when I first met Athena, she didn't have this birthmark.

Ever since I told her about saving a blood-covered man when I worked as a Doctors Without Borders volunteer in Tilan Country, she started distancing herself from me.

Not long after, she became Declan's sister, and Declan had also said that Athena had saved his life.

But Athena was a coward who feared death. Tilan Country, a war-torn nation—she'd never even been there, always bad-mouthing and looking down on it.

My fingers curled coldly as an absurd suspicion gradually took shape in my mind.

So that's how it is!

I collapsed to the floor, crying and laughing at the same time.

Chapter 3

After a long while, I wiped away my tears, composed myself, and find an unfamiliar phone number.

""I've got a ten-billion-dollar deal. You interested?""

""What kind of business?""

""Kidnap me in three days.""

I gently touched my belly, ""Declan will pay this ransom willingly.""

Just as I hung up, Declan pushed the door open.

He'd been drinking heavily, stumbling slightly as he walked, but his vigilance was sharp as ever as he grabbed my hand, ""What am I supposedly paying for willingly?""

I answered without blinking, ""I saw a beactiful necklace. They said I need to pay for first.""

He smiled and rested his head on my shoulder, ""Fine, I'll pay, I'll pay for everything. Athena, whatever you want, I will give you. I'm yours too.""

I kept my expression blank as I helped him to bed and tucked him in, then lay beside him with my eyes open all night.

The next day, halfway to the bridal shop, Declan took a call and frantically explained to me, ""Honey,I need to go handle some toubles right now.""

He gripped my hand apologetically, ""I'm sorry. Tomorrow I'll definitely come with you to try on the dress. I even ordered matching a rare rings—let's go try them together tomorrow, okay?""

I pulled my hand away, ""I understand. Go handle your business. I'll be good and wait for you at home.""

He squeezed my hand, and as soon as I got out of the car, he sped away.

Less than ten minutes later, Milo's car arrived.

As soon as I got in, a photo of Athena came through.

She wore a dazzling diamond ring and the imported wedding dress I'd chosen, kneeling on a man's lap.

A large hand rested on her pale thigh through the sheer fabric, lips kissing the crescent birthmark on her right shoulder, eyes dark with desire.

A message followed immediately.

""I can only make love with her at night with the lights off, imagining she's you.Athena, my sweet baby, your brother misses you so much. Make your brother feel good.""

The hoarse voice was followed by suppressed panting.

In the silent car, Milo's mocking laughter rang out.

I was shocked, suddenly realizing we weren't heading home.

""Milo, I'm Mrs.Royce! What the hell do you think you're doing?""

The car stopped abruptly. I immediately reached for the other door, but he was faster, grabbing my ankle and dragging me out of the car.

The pain made everything go black.

I glared at him through gritted teeth, ""I'm carrying Declan's baby. If anything happens to me, you won't survive either.""

""You stupid bitch, you don't really think Declan would let a dirty whore like you carry his child, do you?""

A shrill laugh came from behind me. Only then did I notice this street wasn't far from the bridal shop.

Athena stepped on my face, her eyes and expression full of gleeful satisfaction.

Milo walked over and wrapped his arms around her waist, groping her roughly. Under my shocked gaze, the two kissed passionately!

After a while, Milo spoke leisurely, ""You heard us at the door that day, didn't you? Too bad the embryo in your belly isn't Athena's either. I just grabbed some random bastard's spawn from the slums and swapped it out.""

I jerked my head up, pupils trembling with shock.

Athena laughed until she shook.

""Oh gosh, now you're dirty bitch inside and out! A bastard's baby, a whore mother.

Talia, what's the difference between you and a club hooker? At least they get paid a few bucks. You're not getting money to birth a bastard!""

""Is one enough? Should we stuff your belly more?""

My head was spinning, thick sweetness rushing to my throat.

I roared and grabbed a stone from the ground, wanting nothing more than to take these two down with me.

Milo kicked me in the stomach. I fell face-first, spitting up blood, my face pale with agony.

But just then, Athena suddenly stepped back in apparent terror, swaying before falling backward.

Even though she hadn't been hurt, Declan came running and stepped on my hand as he rushed to hold her, his eyes full of naked concern, ""Athena, how are you? Are you injuried?""",1,1749883800.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

He was an emergency induction at 37+2 so he was small but is 8 pounds now. He was doing super well, but yesterday and today I noticed severe irritation around his butthole.

 I have a 2 year old so I know what diaper rash looks like, and it doesn't look like that to me, no bumps etc,  it's just completely cherry red around the area. My mother in law told me it looks like I ate something that when it passed through the breastmilk irritated his skin on the way out.

 The only thing I've changed in the last few days is caffeine. I stayed pretty much away from it during  pregnancy but have had a  ton of iced coffee this week. I cut out dairy about a week ago, which I know can cause problems but I was thinking that all should be put of our systems by now. 

Is it caffine, or something else? I change him every 2 to 3 hours before feedings and he always poops so I don't know if maybe I'm just cleaning the area too agressively? But I want to get it clean..

Clare, 26 years old brunette American. Medium in height, slim figured with an average pretty face. Not to make a whole room stare but if anyone look at her with interest, her looks can make them willing to learn her beauty. Works as a room service assistant at Phoenix cruises, Australia.

Clare: Another busy Monday Evening. Cruise ships are ready at Sydney deck to leave in few minutes. Me, getting dressed to my uniform white shirt, black knee length skirt, white sneakers, nude lipstick, little eye liner, mascara and yes my dark brown hairs tied in pony tail. Ready to go to my work. I get into the kitchen, looking at the orders. Rick our vegan chef handed me his serving cart, filled with all the vegan items for our Vegan passengers. I took the serving cart and went out to serve evening snacks and drinks for our passengers. Room number 109 1st class luxury suit, 2 grilled veggie sandwich and one plate tofu cutlets. I arranged them on my tray and rang the room bell. No answer. I rang again and told ""room services, for snacks"" in loud voice. Yet no answer. Knocking on the door. I heard a key sound, and the door opened.

A tall fair handsome guy with half wet body clearly coming out of the shower only in a towel wrapped around his waist with messy wet hair standing in front of me. This vegan passenger is fucking damn hot. I'm examining him from his toe to head. I can't even take my eyes away . Meanwhile I forgot I have to serve the food and visit other rooms too.

""Sir your snacks here do you want me to serve them?"" I asked the handsome hunk looking at his bare chest.

""Yes sure come in"" came the reply from his sexy lips. His voice is so seductive.

I entered the luxury suite, placed my serving tray on the table. He went inside and came out in loose jeans and a white t shirt. Why he covers himself? Oh no he's staring at me. Not a usual look, his eyes are so addictive. ""Clare you have to escape this"" I said to myself.

He Sat on the chair in front of me keeping his left elbow on the table. I bent a little and serve him the sandwiches and kept the cutlets beside. I didn't notice any drinks so I I asked him ""any beverages tea coffee or or any other drinks?"" I asked

* I don't drink coffee and tea will be too much ordinary for this beautiful cruise ship
* any others soft or hot drinks we have many varieties you can choose from our menu.
* I don't drink much. And I recently turned vegan. Can you suggest me any good soft drink?

\-Sure, tell me your preferences

* I will be good at anything you suggest me one and I will try that since I don't have much ideas about soft drinks available here.
* Then sir please try our luxury blue lagoon. I can be much sure you will like it. Is really delicious.
* Okay I will have it, bring me one
* Thank you sir. I will be back in a while. I have some other foods to deliver then I will come back with your drink. Give me some time or you can order from the telephone in your room and bring it faster.

Oh this guy staring at my breasts? What's so attractive above my over sized t shirt? I'm starting to feel awkward.

Then he looked at my face and said "" I'm in no hurry Clare, you can take your time I am here to relax in this journey"".

Ohh he was reading my name on my badge. It felt like a relief.

""thank you sir for your patience"" I replied.

picking my serving tray i left that luxury suite room number 109, Thinking This man was so hot to ignore.

Michael: She pulled the door and left. Ohh man! I thought, This girl is so good at staring. Her staring was almost making me hard, I wonder how crazy it will be to fuck her under that black skirt. I want her more to be around me. This journey is gonna fun.

Before completing my snacks I heard a knock again on my door. Here she is, carrying my drink on her tray, coming towards Me with. I saw her perfectly curved waist moving left right left right left right. Placing my drink on my table.

""Enjoy your drink and journey"" she said with a bright smile.

""Sure"" I replied

Oh no she's about to leave. I'm getting panicked, ""I have to say something, I have to say something"" i am telling to myself. Then I spoke ""hey Clare""

She turned back and replied ""yes?""

When can "" I asked for my dinner I mean around which hour?""

She giggled a little and said "" is this your first time on luxury class sir? It doesn't seem so""

Her smile suits so perfect on her face. Anyone can fall for it

I said ""what brought you this question?""

* "" any cruise ship or flight provide full time immediate service for luxury class passengers. You are in a luxury suit so you can ask for your lunch, dinner, breakfast or snacks anytime of the day you want. We will be at your service at that moment"".
* ohh I just keep forgetting things, it skipped my mind. Sorry to bother you. Thank you providing us such a good service.
* this is our work. Thank you.

Again she left. And I can't stop thinking about her curves, her ass, her back, her lips, her whole body.

Michael: It's almost night, I'm sitting in front of my huge window facing the sea. Listening to music through my headphones. It's a nice view of limitless sea from my window. It's so peaceful after spending months after months working between machines, between busy peoples, working with clock. This now feels peaceful. I looked at the clock and walked toward the telephone I dialled the the ship's kitchen number and male voice came from there:

""Hello sir what would you like to have?""

""Mmm... Pasta with various vegetables, chilli baby corn, boiled sweet corn and that's it .."" I replied

""That's it? Anything more sir?"" Came from other side.

\-Enough for now. Thank you

\-Sir your room number please?

\-109

* thank you sir your order will receive in in a while.

I left the phone and waited for my food to come, more of I waited for Clare to come.

After sometime I hear a knock. I checked myself again in the mirror and open the door. Here she is with my dinner.

""Come in"" I said to her

She came inside, serving my food on the table when I noticed her dark brunette hair tied behind her, look so nice to run my fingers into.

""Here's your dinner sir, perfectly served"" she said looking at my eyes

""Would you like to have anything more?"" She added.

\-No I'm good with all these.

She left after serving my dinner and I lock the door behind her.

After finishing my dinner I went out to explore the outside, the open sky and the limitless sea. I was walking under to open sky, feeling the cool Breeze of the sea and not thinking about anything from my busy life. Suddenly I felt something hitting behind me, I turned around and saw Clare rushing with some wine bottles on her serving trey. She seems in hurry. she didn't even look at me, keeping her eyes downwards she uttered ""I'm sorry"" picked up her things and went past me. I wanted to say something but didn't got much chance and time. These cruises must have very busy schedule on ship she looked so busy and a little sad too. I said to myself. After spending some time outside I decided to go to sleep. I went inside my room turned off all the lights and collapsed on my bed for a peaceful sleep.

I woke up in the morning the sun looks so beautiful on the sea. I got fresh up and reached to the telephone to order my morning tea.

""Hello sir, good morning"" came the first voice

""Good morning"" I wished back

* what would you like to have tea or coffee sir?
* I would like to have a sugar free green tea with some diet biscuits
* your morning tea will reach you in few minutes. Have a nice day sir.

\-You too

Keeping the phone down i sat beside my window looking outside waiting for my tea.

My door bell rang, I went to open the door excited. I arrange my hair again then unlocked the door. Disappointment. It isn't her. she isn't here. There is a guy standing in front of my door with my morning tea .

"" Good morning sir your green tea is here"" he said.

I asked him to come inside

After he left my tea, my cookies on the table, and about to leave I stopped him.

"" Hey can I know your name please?"" I asked him

* I'm Jacob
* nice to meet you Jacob, I have a question for you
* I will try to answer if I can, ask me
* I really like this ship's service but can I have one person for all my service when I am on the ship till it reach the shore in New Zealand? I can pay more for this but I would really like to have one single person for all my services. Is this possible?
* this is possible,

I felt a relief after a disappointment.

Then he added "" but you have to talk to the manager for this. I am not in charge. You can dial his number from the phone book from our telephone and ask our manager for it""

""Thank you very much Jacob for letting me know this, I will give you an extra tip"" I said and pulled out a 50 aus dollar note from my wallet and handed to him saying ""Keep this""

""Thank you sir, have a nice day""

Then he left.

Michael: I dialed the manager's number. A Heavy weighted voice came from the other side. Seems like a middle aged man.

""Hello how can I help you?"" he asked

""Hello I am calling from first class room number 109. I am calling because I would like to have only one of your staff appointed for all my services. I asked one of your staff is this possible on your ship or not and he said it is possible so I want 1 single staff appointed for me"" I said

* Yes this is possible. Do you have any suggestion or you want me to appoint any one staff of my choice?

\-Yesterday I was served by a woman named Clare. I would like to appoint her.

* I am sorry sir, but she will not be able to continue her service on our ship.

This was a shock for me.

I asked "" may I know the reason? it was all find with her yesterday.

* actually last night she destroyed some of our expensive drinks while serving some of our passengers. Those drinks were much expensive and she can't pay for them, even her salary is not that much that we can cut from there. Those passengers even complaint her service was not upto mark. So she was fired last night from her job.

I knew something was definitely wrong with her when i saw her yesterday.

I replied ""She served me three times yesterday it all looked good to me, I think those pessenger might have a misunderstanding""

'But sir she can't pay for the damage she caused so we had to remove her"" he said

* If this is about money I can pay on behalf of her, just tell me the amount and I will pay for that. I want to appoint her for my services. Take her back and appoint for my service.
* Ok sir if you are willing to pay then we can take her back in job.
* Good

\-After sometime I will be ordering my breakfast and I want her to bring my food

* Yes sir sure we will make it possible
* thank you

\-Thank you sir. Have a nice day

I put down the phone walked towards the the attached balcony sipping my green tea.

Clare: First time, this happened for the first time a passenger paid for the mess I created. I was almost hopeless last night when I was fired from my job. I was so depressed thinking about how I will live from my next month without having any job in my hand. I was scared this would be my last journey on a ship. I can't explain how bad last night was. Why I always had to suffer for the mess I don't want to create? This journey is really gonna lucky for me, a passenger paying for my debts. This doesn't happen everyday.

Many things were going inside my head when the manager informed me I was taken back on my work and a stranger whom I served yesterday paid on behalf of me. Does he know me? do I know him? Does he have any other intention? Why me? Why appointing me for all his services? Does these rich people really care who is serving them? or they always need one person only working for them? I don't know.

I am walking towards his room, no. 109 carrying only his breakfast with all these questions in my head.

With nervousness I knocked his door. He opened with a bright smile. ""Good to see you back"" he said to me. And his voice making me fall for him.

I smiled and enter the room.

""Can I ask you something"" came out of my mouth.

""I know you have many things to ask"" He paused. I am going to say something but he continued ""come inside sit here, make yourself comfortable and ask me one by one I am here to answer all of your questions.

Again So unusual. I sit on a chair. He sit facing me. The way he is looking at me making me weak on my knees. I still manage to ask ""why?"" I paused a little

""Why did you paid for my mess?"" I asked

""You deserve to work"" he replied

* you don't know me, I don't know you how can you just say I deserve it? You are suspicious.

\-Ok fine, let me tell you I am Michael. I'm attracted to you and I want to fuck you.

Okay this is so straight forward, I said to myself.

""I didn't understandddddd"" I continued the word

""Come on, don't act like a child. I can see how you look at me. I know how you feel"" he replied.

Well Now I am getting nervous, the way he is looking while speaking to me making me want him all over me.

""So this is the actual reason?"" I asked

""Definitely, I know you are attracted to me too. No point of hiding anymore. Lots of hide and seek. now tell me from your sexy lips""

I frowned and asked ""whatttt?""

\-Tell me do you want to serve me all the way I ask? After all I saved your job, I can ask for a little more service beyond what you are trained for in this cruises"".

He is looking so seductive while talking. It is becoming so hard for me to say no. why I'm falling for his words? Oh no He is making me weak.

I am staring at him speechless, rubbing my thighs against each other. Oh no he notices it.

Then he raises from his chair, walking towards me I am feeling so different. My body is getting nervous, a different kind of sensation. He is making me feel so different. He is standing in front of me, touching my face, his touch is so electrifying. I'm getting current all over my body. I got up from my chair looking at him. He looks so horny. He Is making me horny by his looks, by his touch. ""You are making me weak"" I said.

""That's what I want baby, I want you to be weak in front of me. Weak enough not to resist me. Just say yes"" he said moving his hands all over my back, pulling me closer to his body by my waist. I am feeling so weak, so badly wanting him to fuck me.

With the nervous voice I said ""I can't say no. I want your hands on me, I want you all over me"".

The moment I finished he pulled me closer and sealed his lips on mine. I kiss back then he then again me. Oh my fuck his lips are already seducing me. I can't control anymore, I moaned while kissing him. While kissing he's moving his hands on my back, on my waist, on my ass. Oh fuckk, his hands are so hard on me. He took me towards the wall while kissing, unbuttoning my shirt, running his hands all over my body. As soon we stopped kissing he took his lips down to my neck burying his face between my face and my shoulders. Biting my neck hard, I escaped the moan. I want this, yes I want this. I want this more and more, it is painful pleasure. I want him more badly now. With my shirt half open he took his fingers inside my skirt ohh fuckkk I'm getting wet. He is running his hands, rubbing my vagina over my pants, making groaning sound from his mouth, he is looking so wild. I am not in my control anymore. He took over me, I am no more to myself I am weak in his arms. Suddenly he put his fingers inside feeling my wetness and I screamed ""aaaahhhhh""

Immediately he put his another hand on my mouth, looking at my eyes he said ""ssshhhhhhhhh"" to make me silent. But being silent is next to impossible at that moment. I was not in my control that I will keep myself calm. He was making hard to not to scream but I was making soft moans I can't control that.

""Come baby come to the bed, let's not waste time, I'm so hard. You made me so hard"" he said looking at me

""This soon? I'm loving this foreplay. You are making me so wet to want you more and more"" I replied

* foreplay kills the actual pleasure baby. Come sit on my lap, let my pleasuring organ explore your pleasuring organ.
* Ohh! yess

I was in no situation to resist him to fuck me. I want this. I want him. I am ready to do whatever he want me to, I want his pleasure. I want his painful pleasure. He took me to the bed. Taking a packet of condom, he tear the packet with his teeth and placed it on this dick. I sit on his lap pulling down my pants he put his rock hard dick inside me. Oh fuckk, this is so hard to bear, I'm moaning loud, louder. He is inside me, in and out, In and out. I am holding him on his shoulders he is holding my ass, fucking me inside my black skirt. This is such a different experience. I never had this pain so pleasuring. This pain so beautiful. This journey is actually lucky for me. Everything happened yesterday faded away. His lust for me, my lust for him changed everything. Now I think everything happened yesterday happened for a reason, for this reason, for me to have this experience.",1,1749883653.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

It’s comforting almost. I could probably afford a mattress by now, but I choose not to. It makes me feel like I’m in control of my life. Like I wasn’t forced to run away from home, from everything I’ve ever known and start again from nothing. It's my choice to sleep on the floor. It's been five years since I started running. It was my eighteenth birthday, and my father gave me no choice but to flee. Five different cities, all of which had ended with my brother’s and father tracking me down and almost catching me. This time I was able to secure a shitty apartment in an awful neighborhood quickly. It has four walls, a roof, a floor and a lockable door and that was all I needed right now. It's a much better position than I'd be in any other time I had to restart. I've slept on park benches and eaten out of bins. I've begged for change on the streets just to get by. I was making progress finally having a small place to crawl back to at the end of each shitty day. Id grown to liking this city, but nothing ever lasts long.

I had to get the first bus out of there after I spotted my brother’s standing by the car I’d bought out the front of the motel I had been staying at. It was a stupid mistake on my part thinking I could have a car in my name without them tracking it to my location. I was meant to be doing a shift at Thrive that evening. A strip club where I’d landed a job dancing and occasionally bartending. Instead, I walked out that morning to find my father’s pride and joys leaning against my car so casually waiting for me to admit defeat and hand myself over to them. Of course, I did no such thing and took off running before they could see me.

I ran forty minutes to Thrive, which painfully would have taken me only 15 minutes in the car. The whole reason I wanted the stupid liability in the first place. I just needed to get my last paycheck before I skipped town, so I had something this time around to start with. By the time I got there my feet were a mess from running barefoot. Usually, I would have carried my death trap high heels to the car and put them on once I’d clocked in, but I didn’t have that luxury this time.

I’d gotten there late for my shift and a complete mess, but thankfully the manager, Stacy took one look at me and knew something was wrong. I hadn’t told her anything too personal before, but she knew I was in a bad position when I’d first stumbled into the bar asking for a job. I had oversized filthy clothes and a serious matte in my hair from not owning a brush. My shoes were falling apart, and I was so skinny at the time. She took pity on me saying that we’d all been there once and everyone deserved a chance. She taught me how to dance, gave me some of her old outfits and let me crash on her couch for a while once she learned id had nowhere to go. Later she helped me secure a place of my own at the back of a motel and I had saved up enough for a cheap, shitty car. Things were going to well, until my past came back to bite me in the ass.

When I came stumbling into Thrive that night apologizing for being late, Stacy just silently pointed me to her office.

“I’m sorry I’m late, I can’t do my shift either…I just need the weeks pay and I’ve got to go” I said.

“Look darling, I’ve never pried before and I’m not going to start now. I can see you’ve been through some shit and you were in a real bad way when you first got to town so as your friend I’ve got to ask, where are you going to go?”

I took a long breath before saying, “I don’t know”.

“And how are you going to get there?”

“…I don’t know, a bus maybe?”

“And where will you be staying?”

“I don’t know! Look Stacy I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, but this is really time sensitive. I just need the pay, and I need to go.”

“Okay, just slow down love. I get it. I've known runners before. Someone for some reason has found you and you've got to move on, but I can't just let you run off into the wind not knowing anything about where you're going to go. We're friends, okay? I like you and I can help, so I will help. Let me make a phone call to my brother, he owns the club and has plenty of them in different places. We’ll get you transferred to a different club so you can keep earning money, then we’ll sort out a bus ticket and somewhere to stay.”

“You’re not going to ask why I’m leaving?”

“No. In my family, we’re raised not to ask questions we probably don’t want to know the answers to.”

I sat back and waited while Stacy made a phone call to her brother. It seemed like he also didn't ask many questions because it only took a few minutes before she hung up and told me he'd be happy to transfer me immediately and I could start tomorrow. She gave me my weeks' pay, drove me to the bus stop, kissed my cheek goodbye and that was that. It was time to run again. Hopefully her brother is as nice as her.

# Satisfy

It took 8 hours to get here on the bus and by the time I arrived, it was early morning. Id rushed to the club she had me transferred to, Satisfy, so I could fill out some paperwork and get myself on their roster. Thankfully Stacy’s brother had told the manager Kevin that I wouldn’t be going on the payroll and instead I’d be getting cash just like Stacy had been doing for me. It was a relief really; I didn’t need a paper trail, and I didn’t want people asking questions why. Kevin had me put on the roster for that same evening, so I had more than enough time to find the hotel id organized and be able to shower and eat something before my shift started.

“Okay well, welcome to Satisfy! I’m thankful Luciano had you transferred here. We just lost three of our best girls so we’re extremely short staffed now”. He had said. He seemed nice enough. Short, dirty blond hair, medium build and a smile that somehow told me his mother must love him really well.

“Hmmm” I hummed in response. I wanted to be polite but at the same time I didn’t like having to divulge any unnecessary information if I didn’t need to. It was safer that way really.

“Okay great, all the paperwork is done so if you want to meet back here at seven, we can get you sorted out with a wardrobe, have a walkthrough and get you on the stage by eight”.

“A wardrobe? I have a few pieces of my own…”

“Oh no, just come in your own normal clothes, Luciano likes to give each girl their own wardrobe with everything they need.”

“Oh, okay, sure then, I’ll see you at seven... Thanks.”

Luciano was Stacy’s brother, who id learned owned over 20 clubs across the country that he had managed mostly by family, but this one, this one was his. Stacy had told me when she had called him, he was more than happy to have me transferred and needed me to be at the club he managed personally. I thought it was odd at first. Why not send me to any of the others? But I guess if Kevin was saying they were short staffed, that made sense. It was convenient for him.

Id managed my way to the hotel. I had just enough money for a week’s stay, that was if I didn’t spend any of it anywhere else. Which meant that the complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits in my room were going to be the only thing I would be eating for a while. That didn’t bother me too much, my body was used to running on less than what was deemed a normal amount of food. I took one of the sugar packets and sat down on the musty brown comforter on top of the hard bed. I’d have to go slow with what I had supplied so for now I figured a sugar packet would suffice until I’d finished my shift tonight. Maybe then I’d treat myself to one of the four biscuit packets. I tore off the top of the sugar packet, not caring about letting the rubbish fall to the floor. It didn’t look like the place was very clean to begin with, so I didn’t think it really mattered. Letting the sugar fall onto my tongue I let it rest there while it dissolved. A trick id learned from when I was younger, being locked in my room for days on end by my father with no food or water. Occasionally one of the staff that worked in the home would slide something under the door. It had always had to be small enough to fit through the sliver of space. Usually, a squashed piece of bread or candy. I learned quickly to eat little bits over a long period of time and to let it sit on my tongue so I could trick my brain into thinking I had more food than I did.

Shivering off the memory I made my way into the dimly lit bathroom connected to my room. It wasn’t much, but it did come with some soap and shampoo that I knew I desperately needed. I turned on the water and let it steam up before I stepped in, hissing as the water hit the tender spots on my feet from running without shoes. I used all the tiny shampoo that didn’t do much but made my hair feel dry and tangled. The soap was even worse, making my skin feel like rubber, but it did take off the stench id acquired, and I could at least be thankful for that. Hoping out of the shower and using the slightly stained towel to dry off, I used my fingers to comb through the mess of my hair and made my way over to the bag of things I’d managed to get from Thrive before I left. I couldn’t go back and get anything from my motel room there so I would have to make do with a pair of my stripper bottoms and the clothes id already been wearing. I guess it was a good thing Kevin mentioned I’d be getting a wardrobe at the club. Maybe there would be some stuff I could use until I had a bit of cash to buy some secondhand clothes.

It was just after 6 when I’d decided to have another sugar packet before grabbing my purse and leaving for the club. I’d need a little bit of energy to walk there and get the shift done. “Lilly! You’re early” Kevin said as id entered the club’s main doors. The place was still quiet, with just a few staff members looking to be setting up for the night.

“Uh yeah sorry, I didn’t know how long it would take me to get here so I figured it be best to be early rather than late.”

“No that’s fine, we can get started with your wardrobe, meet the other girls and get you ready for tonight if you’d like.”

# Pure, dark, violence

We walked past the bar to the back of the club, Kevin pointing out different things as we went.

“We’ll do a proper walkthrough once we’ve got you set up but this here” he said as he pointed to a keypad by a red door. “This is for the girls only, of course with me and Luciano as an expectation.”

He showed me the pin and we walked into the room. It was much bigger than the changing rooms at Thrive. It has a thick, plush red carpet and black walls. Mirrors and makeup tables lined the walls, and a few girls were already seated and fixing themselves. I’m glad I’m not the only one who likes to be early.

“Hey! Ohhhh is this the new girl you were telling me about Kevin!?”

This blonde barbie looking explosion was bouncing out of her seat and practically skipping her way over in 8-inch pink stilettos. How she was even managing not to break her neck was beyond me. She had on a two piece bright pink leather bra and short shorts. Her breasts looked as though they might bounce up into her face and knock her out. Her platinum blond hair was pulled back into a high ponytail and she had makeup that made her look somewhat innocent if you didn’t look below her shoulders at the rest of her outfit.

“I’m Candy!” she said as she pulled me in for a hug that honestly felt like I should be paying for with how much I could feel her breasts pushing up against me.

“Is that because you’re all sweet and bubbly and shit?” I said before I could even register the blatantly rude tone I was using.

“Ha! Exactly, sweet like Candy and they all want a taste” she said giving me a wink.

“So, what’s your name?”

“Oh sorry, Lilly” I said giving off a half smile.

“Nooo, girly you need a stage name! Lord knows my parents would never have named me Candy. We pick a stage name to protect ourselves from any creepers trying to weasel into our outside lives.”

“Oh, well I don’t have one.”

I didn’t need to tell her Lilly wasn’t even my real name so I never really thought it mattered if I used it in the clubs. If anyone ever tried to find me with that name, they wouldn’t. I made sure of that.

“Didn’t you get transferred here from another club?”

“Yeah?”

“So how did you protect yourself from creeps? What would have happened if someone used your name to say find out where you lived?”

“Oh well if anyone was a ‘creep’ I’d just punch them in the balls, poke my fingers in their eyes or snap their arm or something” I said shrugging my shoulders.

Candys eyes went wide, Kevin visibly stiffened beside me, and I only just realized what I had said was definitely not a normal statement from a 5ft nothing female who was meant to be dainty and seductive.

After what felt like an eternity but was probably just a minute of holding my breath, she laughed, like she really laughed. Bent over, holding her stomach laughing. Wiping a stray tear from her eye before it could ruin her perfectly set face she said, “Okay, so your stage name from here on out will be Violence” she said with a wicked grin.

Yep, I like this girl. After Candy shooed Kevin off, telling him the girls could handle it from here, I met the others and was shown to my own table. It had everything I’d need, all brand-new, high-end products. Candy explained how Luciano made sure every girl here was well taken care of with what they needed to look the part. Then she showed me to the wardrobes which were conveniently placed in between each table along the wall. Each girl got their own walk-in wardrobe that I swear was just as big as my current hotel room. It had the same red carpet and black walls with golden features and floor to ceiling on all four walls were lined with clothes, shoes and accessories. Everything looked new with price tags and after further inspection it was all in my size. From the breast cups down to the shoes.

“Haha, yeah, I looked just like that when I first saw my wardrobe. Everything here is handpicked for you, usually by Kevin, he has excellent taste and a way of reading what a girl’s style is.”

“Kevin picked all this out for me?”

“Well, no, not exactly” she said with not even a hint of trying to hide her amusement. “I was told your wardrobe was handpicked by Luciano.”

Why the hell would Luciano do this for me? How would he even know my sizes? I haven’t even met the man. I’m just some pity case his sister asked him to take on and he’s spent all this money and bought all these things with me in mind? That doesn’t make any sense...

As if she couldn’t tell or didn’t care for my internal brain battle, Candy grabbed my hand and squealed. Causing me to shift back into focus and squint my eyes at the blonde bubble of energy who was now pulling things out left right and center and pushing them up to my body. No doubt trying to picture what I’d look like in each piece.

“Okay yesssss! This is it, put this one on” she said holding up a black leather corset and underwear.

After id slipped into the outfit, I matched it with a pair of sturdy black heels that laced up around my calves and a black leather chocker that looked slightly more like a collar but fit the look I was going with. Candy helped do my long black hair into a slicked back, high ponytail and finished off with a smokey eye and a bit of blush and mascara. She said I didn’t need much makeup because my skin was flawless as it was, and she only wanted to enhance a few of my features like my electric blue eyes and soft pink lips.

“Oh dang girl, you really did a number on her Candy. The men will eat her up. You’re going to have some competition now.” One of the other girls, Ruby, had said as she stood behind us in the floor to ceiling mirror. Looking back at myself I was shocked. I mean I had outfits from Stacy and dressed up every night I worked at Thrive, but they were all her style. This, what I was seeing, this was me, pure, dark, violence.

# Don't Be Nervous

The club was starting to liven up now, the music blasting, the lights flashing and people started flowing in through the doors. A strong smell of cigarettes and alcohol wafting through the air and a hum went through me from the bass of the music. Kevin told all of the girls where their stages were, and they all politely waved as they made their way out.

“Where do you want me?” I asked as I wasn’t yet given a stage to go to.

“You, my dear Violence have been requested to the VIP area by Luciano.”

“The VIP? Isn’t that usually reserved for the most experienced girls? I’ve only worked with Stacy for a couple of months, and I mean, I know what I’m doing but I’m sure of one the other girls here would be much better suited to your VIP customers.”

“Woah, slow down there, I can practically see your head spinning. Stacy already told us your experience, but she also told us you’re an absolute wonder on stage like you were born to be there. I’m sure Luciano just wants to get to know his newest girl. Come on, I’m sure you’ll do great. Plus, the customers up there give the best tips”. He said with a wink while holding out his arm to escort me to the top floor. I could use the tips, the two sugar packets id had in the last 24 hours weren’t doing me much good and I would eventually need to use some money for food and a backup plan. If there's anything I've learned over these last five years, its to always have a backup plan. In the beginning it was things like another park or bench to sleep on, scraps of food saved or a plan of the bus routes and towns. Since Stacy gave me the job in the last city though and I've had the taste of having a nice-ish place to sleep, I'm thinking a little bigger and I'd like to have enough money sitting aside for when I move again to get another apartment, clothes, toiletries, food, you know, the basics.

The stairs leading to the VIP section has a security guard at the bottom, he unclipped the rope and nodded to us to proceed up. I noticed the change in scenes almost immediately from the rest of the club. The main floor was packed with people now, it was brightly colored and energetic. I’m sure the flashing lights and rowdy customers would have quickly given me a headache. The top floor though, it was closed off from the rest of the club. Kevin showed me the pin to the door at the top of the staircase and when he opened it for me it was like stepping onto a completely different place. The music wasn’t as loud, still prominent but you wouldn’t have to yell over it. The lighting was dim but steady and the features of the room were mostly dark wood and black with a hint of gold and red. I stood next to Kevin, scanning the room, focusing on the stage at the back, it was large enough that I wouldn’t have to rely on the pole the whole time like at Thrive. This one had enough space that if I chose to, I could dance around it comfortably. True to the theme it had a golden pole, red lighting and dark wood making up the stage. I took a step towards its direction, ready to shut out the world and lose myself in the music with the promise of some easy cash, but Kevin placed his hand atop of mine on his arm before I could remove it. Giving him what I could only hope was a polite, questioning gaze he leaned closer to whisper in my ear. “The boss wanted to meet you before you get started. Don’t be nervous.”

Yes, because that’s what I needed not to be nervous I thought as my eyes snapped to the table to the right of the stage where Kevin was leading us now. Six large, well dressed, dangerous looking males were sat, all their eyes focused on me as we walked over. I was thankful now for the grip I had on Kevin’s arm as I’m pretty sure my stomach was ready to fall out of my ass at the sight of the largest man sat on end of the booth. He had jet black hair that was shorter on the sides and slightly longer on the top. Tattoos covered his hands and neck, I’m sure they led underneath his expensive looking suit too. I’m not even sure how his suit wasn’t tearing with how large his arms and thighs looked caressed in the material. Gold rings on his fingers were tapping mindlessly on his glass that I’m sure was filled with whisky. He looked like he’d drink whisky. He gave off a vibe that screamed Alpha male. He was dangerous and my stupid vagina couldn’t possibly understand that as it instantly heated when I finished scanning his Greek God gifted body and met his obsidian eyes. Nope, don't do that. I quickly avert my eyes and I'm met with piercing blues like mine. The man sitting next to him looks just as tall, maybe a bit leaner, blonde tussled hair and a boyish smile that makes me feel a lot more at ease. I scan the rest of the group and I swear there must be something in the dam water. Why are they all so massive? How the hell did Stacy grow up around these guys and not get pregnant? My ovaries are currently screaming at me to reproduce right now.

“Kevin” he said as his eyes flicked from mine to the male, I had forgotten I was holding on to.

“Mr Donatello, let me introduce you to your newest girl. This beauty here is Violence.""

He looks me up and down and smiles wickedly. His obsidian eyes stare straight into my soul.

# Did My Heart Just Stutter?

\*\*Luciano\*\*

“Violence…” I said with a smirk as I held my hand out to the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I didn’t bother to stand, no, that would give her an option to hesitate, and I needed her to know right from this moment that she was mine. I’ve never had my heart stutter before, being raised all my life to become what I am today never allowed for me to have such feelings. I am Don of the largest Mafia family in this country, my heart should not stutter, but this dark angel places her tiny soft hand in mine, that’s exactly what it did. I didn’t hesitate once I had her hand in mine. A slight tug and she was falling right into my arms. The hand I didn’t have a hold of came out to land softly on my shoulder and I placed the one I had on my other shoulder as I slipped my hand to the small of her back to bring her to sit on my lap in a perfect fluid motion. She's tiny against my body. Delicate, breakable but her eyes are fierce and hold a fire in them.

My sister, Stacy had told me about this girl working at one of my other clubs. She hadn’t said much, just that she appeared to be running from something or better yet, someone and needed my help to get her out of there. I initially agreed because I needed more dancers, but when I had my PI look into this girl, Lilly Ontario, he couldn’t find anything. Not a single trace of her ever existing anywhere and that intrigued me. Usually, even people under a false identity were an easy enough case for my guy but this girl has stumped him. I had called my sister back this morning after Lilly arrived to talk to Kevin. I needed to know more about her as I watched her from the security cameras in Kevin’s office. She was simply too breathtaking to just ignore. Stacy had told me about how she met her with nothing but the clothes on her back needing a job. She went on to tell me how after her first shift she had offered her a ride home as it was too late in the night to let the girl walk anywhere and when Lilly had pointed her in the direction of a park she quickly figured out where this girl has planned on sleeping and couldn’t allow it, so she took her home and let her stay on her couch for a couple of weeks until Lilly had enough cash to get a room at some shitty motel on the wrong side of town. There wasn’t much more of importance Stacy could tell me other than her clothes and shoe size and as my mind had tried to work out this pretty little anomaly I found myself at the mall picking out everything my brain could imagine her milky skin slipping in and out of. It’s usually a job I handed over to Kevin, but this girl did something to me, and I felt inclined to be the one to pick everything she would wear on that milky soft skin.

“oh... um, Mr Donatello…”

She was clearly thrown off by the sudden movements and didn't know what was happening. Good I thought, she will need to learn to trust me.

She was blushing a nice pink in her cheeks and oh man it looked so good on her. I wonder what things I could do to her to keep her blushing.

“Violence. I’m hoping you found everything you needed in the dressing room.”

“Uh yeah Sir, thank you, it was all more than enough and thank you for the club transfer.”

She was wiggling that tight little ass in my lap, no doubt nervous by my men and I, and I needed to remove her quickly before she felt how incredibly hard I was getting. That probably wouldn’t be the best first impression. Luca, my best friend and right hand was smiling at her like the bloody golden retriever he is, and she was shifting her eyes around on all of us unsure of where to look. It seems she settled on the floor. I made a note of teaching her out of that habit. This girl would learn to hold her head high in any room with me.

“Hmmm” I hummed. “Let’s get you situated on the stage then. My sister has asked that I take good care of you, so whenever you work here your only stage will be here in the VIP. I won’t have you downstairs with the rowdy crowd, okay?”

“Yes Sir, I understand, thank you.”

""I'm Luca by the way!"" he says as he holds out his hand.

""Are you going to swing me around and pull me onto your lap too?"" She says back with a little bite.

Luca looks at me with those stupid pleading puppy dog eyes like I might actually let him and I narrow my eyes to tell him to back off.

""Of course not, now that would be a rude way to introduce myself, wouldn't it?"" He winks and nudges me.

I roll my eyes and let the girl stand. I watch as she adjusts her outfit and steps back to Kevin.

""Ready to dance, Violence?"" Kevin says as she takes his arm again. The arm that I wish was mine. Fuck, really? Thats possessive of me...

She nods at him and they turn around towards the stage. I just sit and watch as that cute little ass struts away. Such perfect curves. I look at Luca who's doing to same thing and slap him up the back of the head.

""Hey!""

""Keep your eyes to yourself!""

""It's literally a strip club, Don and she, well she's something special to look at."" He wiggles his eyebrows and then rests his chin on his hands and continues watching her. I can't say I blame him. She really is something special.

# A Lady Doesn't Tell.

\*\*Violence.\*\*

To say that man is intimidating is a definite understatement. Stacy had asked him to take care of me though and I guess having a man like that in my corner would be a real asset. Kevin helped me onto the stage, and I was more than ready to dance. Something I figured out quickly at Thrive was that I was somewhat of a natural on stage. I was able to shut off the world, turn on my blinders and feel the music as if I was the only person in the room. I transported from this world where I was a pathetic run away with nothing to my name, to another where I was a powerful force of seductive and sexual energy, a goddess of the night where men would bow before me to witness my enchantments. I took a deep breath as the song finished and I run one hand up the cold metal of the pole. Closing my eyes I hear the beat of the music begin and I imagine that I transform myself into a flame dancing around with the fire that burns within my soul.

After about three hours Kevin comes back to let me know it’s time for break. He lets me know I can head down to the dressing room to eat if I wish, but obviously I didn’t bring anything and I think he already knew that.

“Well, there’s a two-drink limit when you’re working, but they’re on the house. You’re more than welcome to stay up here at the bar and you’ll find some fruit we usually use for the drinks in the mini fridge. We rarely ever use them so you’re welcome to those too.”

“Thanks” I mumble, half embarrassed and swallowing my pride as I tell him I’ll take him up on the offer.

I pour myself a rum and coke and slice an orange that literally has my mouth watering at this point. The rum is refreshing and cool as it trickles down my throat. I settled in on one of the stools as I tried to zone out the room.

“Hey, Violence, right?”

I hear a gentleman to my right say as he walks closer and gestures to the seat beside me. He was probably in his late fifty’s, well built like the rest of the men up here. There must be steroids in the water or something. If you saw him from a far, you’d probably think he had a full head of hair but as he got closer I noticed he was completely bald but instead it was tattoos that lined his head and bits of his face. His neck and hands were also inked, and he gave me the impression he could probably snap my neck in a heartbeat of he wanted to. His smile was warm though, something I wasn’t as accustomed to. Just like every other male up here his suit said, ‘I have money, a lot of fucking money’.

“Do you mind?” He gestures to the stool next to mine.

“Yes, of course, please” I say as I show that it’s fine he wishes to accompany me in my break. Which it most definitely is not. I hate small talk or talk in general. Why do you need to be here in my space? But I’m not going to say that, no, I need this job, and apparently this orange too as I can’t stop myself from devouring it. I had grown too comfortable with somewhat healthy eating habits and now I was suffering for it on the stupid two sugar packets.

“You’re an absolute dream up there darling, and your demeanor off stage too. Most girls can’t help but hang off the guys up here. Nagging in our ears and trying to get into our beds. It’s a welcome change. Something akin to how a woman should behave.”

“No offence Sir, but I couldn’t care less for your bed or the money dripping from you. I’m just here to earn my money and eat my free orange, but I will say you’re wrong if you think I behave anything like a fucking lady should”.

I couldn’t help myself. It just came out like word vomit when I should have shoved it into a mental vault and smiled ‘like a lady should’.

“Haha! He bellowed. “And a sharp tongue too. I guess that’s why they call you violence right?”

“Hmm something like that.”

“Would there possibly be another reason for the name?”

I raised my eyebrow in interest as I let the last orange skin drop down onto the plate in front of me.

“Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. A lady doesn’t tell her secrets.”

“Well, that may be exactly what my club is looking for.”

He slides a white business card over to me discreetly and I look down to see it has nothing but an address on it. I’ve seen cards like these before, given it’s been a long time, but I would know the signs of an underground fight club anywhere. After all, my father owned one and trained me to fight before I could even walk.

“When?” that’s all I needed to know, because there was good, fast money in them and that is exactly what I needed.

“Ha, I knew I was right. I could see the fire in those eyes. Mondays and Fridays, 2am to 5am”

“And the password?”

A smirk formed across his stubble ridden face. He knew I wouldn’t be able to get in without that, but also didn’t tell me to see if I knew the way a fight club worked. Of course I knew, but I wasn’t about to divulge information I didn’t need to about how or why I knew how these things operated.

“Firefly.”

“Admission cost?”

“For you, Violence, I’ll cover your first round. You win that and you’ll have enough for a second round and some to pocket. Just tell Benji as the desk that Ronaldo has you covered.”

He finished his drink and went to leave before turning around.

“Oh, and this” he said as he pulled a stack of notes from his wallet and putting them on the bar in front of me. “This is a tip being such a lovely ‘lady’ to watch tonight.”

I nodded my head and smiled like I should have done to begin with before taking the money. I went to fold it and put it straight into the cup of my corset along with the business card, but my eyes snagged on the amount. Holy shit, there must be at least $500 here. I’m definitely eating all those biscuits tonight. If this man’s fight club was anything like my dad’s, then maybe I could get on my feet faster than I thought.

# Don First.

The rest of my shift went by really quick, and I managed to get a butt ton of tips although I hadn’t had a chance to count how much yet but by the feeling of how full my cups were, it’s more than enough to call this a running start. Id noticed Luciano’s eyes on me most of the night, which kept pulling my attention to him, but I guess every man up here was obviously going to stare at the seductively dressed female dancing on a stripper pole. I also kept getting overly excited looks from his friend Luca. That almost threw me off from the mask I was wearing a few times. He's got that contagious sort of smile that makes you want to smile back. I headed to the dressing room and told the girls about my night. Candy asked if I needed a lift home, but I politely denied, lying through my teeth that I had a lift. I do not need people getting close. I take what I need and nothing more, that's the safest option for everyone. When all the girls left, I made my way into my wardrobe to find my discarded outfit from earlier today but I promptly noted that there seemed to be a section of clothes that looked like everyday wear. Although it was odd that the owner of a club would provide normal clothes for the girls, I was extremely thankful and snagged a fresh pair of jeans, a white shirt and a black hoodie. Slipping out into the fresh early morning air I took out my phone to map the safest way back to the hotel. Most women would think it would be safer to take main roads with streetlights, but I knew better. Back roads, alley ways and the dark of night were my friend. I would regularly slink around in the dead of night unseen. My way of thinking was if no one knew you were there, how could they grab you?

It took half an hour on my detour route back and I immediately devoured the biscuits and started counting the tips from my night. Almost $2000, holy hell, I never made that much at Thrive. I decided that tomorrow I would try to look for a shitty apartment, hopefully one where I could pay with cash, and I’d need to find a gym to work out how rusty I had gotten fighting. Id kept up my stamina over the years, I usually liked to work out once a day to stay in shape. Usually at parks because it is free, but I would need a bag to gain back some muscle memory before Monday. Two days’ prep would have to be enough.

Having sorted out my plan for tomorrow I decided to pull the comforter off the bed to the floor where I know I would feel safer. I always felt safer there.

\*\*Luciano\*\*

I sat with my men in the VIP section of the club most of the night. We had plenty to discuss with upcoming shipments and deals and when we were through with that I asked about my men’s families. Family was very important to us. I was raised alongside these guys. Our parents treated us all like siblings and would always remain close. I watched over Violence all night while talking with my guys. I was trying to be discreet about it, Luca was not, and I wanted to stay until her shift ended so I could ask to drive her back to wherever she was staying. Kevin hadn’t been able to get much personal information from her this morning when going through the paperwork with her and when he’d asked for a home address, she’s merely told him she didn’t have one yet. When he asked then for the address of where she would be staying, she told him that she had not yet checked into a hotel but would happily update him with that information when she had. By now she should have checked in somewhere so I wanted to drive her after her shift so I knew exactly where I could find my little angel.

My friend Matteo had gotten a phone call an hour before the club would close for the night. He excused himself to take it in my office off the side of the VIP section and when he came back, the look on his face told me it was going to be an even longer night.

“Boss, we just got word there’s been a sighting of Angelo near your sister’s club.”

“Well I guess we had better head there and check it out then.”

Angelo Salvatore was number one on our hit list and had been ever since he put my father six feet under 5 years ago. They had a meeting to discuss a possible alliance with gun trades but instead that idiot put a bullet in the back of his head before he even knew it was coming. He’s somehow been evading my men and I ever since. As much as I wanted to stay and make sure Violence got home safe, I needed to be Don first. Downing the last of our drinks, my men and I headed out for the night to travel the 8 hours to my sister's club. Maybe I could even get some more information of my little angel while I'm there. We took a few cars, leaving some men behind with Tony to look after things here while we were gone. If we could get a lead on Angelo I'd follow it like a hound. I've dedicated my life to killing him, my men have too. You don't just kill a Don and get away with it. I will follow him to the pits of hell if I have to just to get revenge for what he's done. He's like a bloody cockroach though and every time we get even the slightest tip of where he is, he's gone.",1,1749883616.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1lb294p,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1lb294p/if_2_years_checkin/,IF 2 years checkin,"Just hitting the 2-year mark of doing intermittent fasting, and honestly—it’s been way easier than I expected. My routine is pretty simple: last meal around 9 or 10 PM, then I don’t eat again until about noon the next day. 

Nothing too extreme, just a gentle rhythm that fits into my day without much fuss.

One thing I didn’t do was cut out snacks completely—I just made sure to enjoy them during my eating window (no wild late-night snack fests though). 

Coffee and water have been my best friends during the fasting hours—super helpful for keeping energy up and hunger in check. 

Of course, life happens—like vacations! I usually take a 1–2 week break from the routine about twice a year when I travel. During those times, I let go of the fasting schedule and just enjoy the trip and the food. But as soon as I’m back home, I get right back into my rhythm—no overthinking, no excuses. It’s all about balance and being kind to myself while still keeping the habit going long-term.

All in all, it’s been a chill, sustainable habit that’s just become second nature now.

As for results, I’ve lost almost 10 kg over these two years. I started at 58 kg, and now I’m hovering around 49 kg (give or take 1 kg). At 155 cm tall, I feel really good about where I’m at now. It’s not just the number—it’s the consistency, the energy, and the sense of control that’s been the real win. Happy, healthy, and still enjoying snacks—that’s the sweet spot for me!

Goodluck to those trying to build this habit! ",5,1749883610.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

So first, I want to send love to everyone in this group who are grieving the loss of their beloved animals. 💔🥺❤️🙏

Though my sweet girl was a big girl, weighing in at 19.2 pounds, she showed no signs of anything being wrong leading up to Monday night. I believe she must’ve had a heart attack. I’ve been kicking myself for taking a nap after work because when I woke up, I laid in bed texting a friend for a little while. Little did I know in the living room, she was going to pass away and I wish I would have gotten out of bed just 5 minutes sooner and been there in her final moment. Could I have done something? I don’t know, but at least I could have been there. The sad part is that my husband and daughter were in the living room with her thinking she was just sleeping next to the coffee table. When I came out of the room, my husband said she had let out some stinky gas a few minutes before, but thought it was simply that. I reached down to pet her and when I did, I realized she didn’t move. I gave her a little shake and she was limp. I instantly knew she was dead. I picked her up and brought her to my office so my daughter wouldn’t see her or me as I had gone into complete hysterics at this point. Her body laid limp in my arms and my mind wanted to believe she had just passed out. Reality set in.

I have been beside myself all week, having trouble sleeping, looking at pictures and videos, crying, and flooded with grief and complete sadness. I’ve felt tremendous guilt for all the love she gave me over the years and how I feel I could have loved her better. 

I know one day there will be a time I can look back at memories with fondness, but right now I just miss everything about her so much already. She was the absolute best ever. 

I picked up her remains today and walking out of the vet office with her in a bag felt so surreal. Tonight I sobbed as I held her box and talked to her. My brain can hardly process the fact that my sweet kitty girl is no longer here and is now in a 3x5” box.

TLDR: Had my shot, missed it! 

Many sub-reddits seem to have a lot of single folks looking for love! And rather unfortunately, it looks like they’ve been looking for a really long time with not much success. That reminded me of the time I was looking too… My problem, boys, was that I couldn’t see it if it hit me in the face! So, here’s a cautionary tale… I’m telling you this, so you don’t be me!! 😊

Not sure if you’ve read my last post, my 20’s were days of partying, hitting the bars, working night shifts, and generally living it up. When you work with women colleagues, have agreements and disagreements, go out for chai and smoke breaks, maybe you see them as colleagues and friends rather than potential love interests. You sometimes miss the cues.

It was one of those days. Now let me set the scene here for you! It was a September/October evening, it was drizzling all evening. Back then the roads were emptier, and you could actually have a nice leisurely drive around Hi-Tech city, Khairtabad, Necklace Road at 10 PM without uttering a single curse word! The office had a diner party at this really nice restaurant. In attendance, of course, were some pretty cute girls from my team. The dinner was fun, drinks were had, vibes were good and when it ended, being the chivalrous gentleman that I was, I volunteered to drive folks home.

It was a really beautiful night, slight drizzle, glistening roads reflecting the streetlights, lovely classic rock playing softly in the car stereo, fun conversations as I was dropping folks off one by one. The last person in the car apart from me was this cutie, I’ll call A. We had a bit of a drive to get to her place. She wasn’t originally from Hyderabad and was telling me how she lived alone, missed her hometown and friends and was craving for some good company, I sympathized!

We finally reached her home. I parked the car outside her apartment gate. We rolled down the windows for a final cigarette. A, it seemed, didn’t want the evening to end. She had a nice time! The cigarette was done. A looked at me coyly and said, “Do you wanna come up for some coffee?”

And I said “You crazy? Who has coffee this late at night? Chalo good night!”

My husband, Ryan, is standing on the karaoke stage, making a fool of himself. His shirt is unbuttoned halfway, his tie long abandoned, and his cheeks are flushed from too much whiskey.

“And I………will always love you…..” he sings, closing his eyes.

His voice is terrible.

Standing next to him, practically glued to his side, is his secretary, Emily. Her left arm is around Ryan's waist, her fingers lightly grazing his back as she sings along. She’s younger than me, at least by half a decade, all wide eyes and perfect curves, dressed in a tight, low-cut dress that makes it impossible to ignore her presence. She leans into Ryan, whispering something in his ear, and he throws his head back, laughing. He looks at her like she’s the funniest person in the world.

I’ve never seen him this happy.

The last time I saw him this happy was on our wedding day, seven years ago. Back then, his eyes sparkled when he looked at me. Now, the light in them has grown dimmer; they're shining for someone else.

Around me, everyone is laughing. It’s the company’s quarterly review party, and the employees are loose after a few too many drinks, finding Ryan and Emily’s performance hilarious. But I know what they’re really laughing at. They’re laughing at me. The CEO’s wife, sitting here while her husband practically gropes his secretary in front of everyone. The whispers, the side glances, they don’t even try to hide it.

“Do you think they’re going to kiss?” someone whispers behind me.

“Definitely. Bet they’ll be doing more than kissing after this,” someone else replies, and they both chuckle.

I turn around to look at the people talking. Young, drunk, probably high on weed too. They must be interns. Only people with zero knowledge of the company’s hierarchy would make such a statement close to their employer’s wife.

Or maybe they just don’t care.

The girl, with messy blonde hair and red cheeks, locks eyes with me. “Hi!” she says, a little too loud. “Do you work here?”

Do I work here? My eyes narrow. She's definitely an intern.

She’s pretty, the kind of pretty that comes with youth and arrogance. The boy next to her drapes his arm lazily over her shoulders.

I don’t respond. I just stare at them, cold and unblinking.

Before I can say something that would make them regret their existence, I hear my name called.

“Julie!” the voice says, drawing my attention.

Even before I turn, I know who it is. Samantha, the vice president of marketing. We both work for Paragon Jewels, Ryan’s company, the leading manufacturer of luxury jewelry in North America. Her position is just below mine, so she’s one of the few who calls out my name like we’re friends, even though we’re not.

“Samantha,” I reply, forcing a polite smile.

“I didn’t know you were here, Julie. I was just telling the marketing team we have to get you involved more!”

“Oh?” I say. “Why’s that?”

“Well, you’re the head of marketing, and everyone wants to meet you! You’re so hard to catch these days. And besides, we never get a chance to chat at work,” she says, with an overplayed wink.

Her gaze drifts to the stage where Ryan and Emily are swaying together, sharing the mic, laughing like they’re on some private date instead of a work event.

“So, Mrs. O’Brien,” she says, smirking, “how are you enjoying the show so far?”

She's mocking me. The fucking bitch.

I force a bright smile. “Oh, it’s… fantastic,” I say, struggling to keep a straight face. “I’m thrilled to see my husband’s hard work is being rewarded with such… dedication from his staff.”

The crowd is clapping now, giving Ryan and his secretary a standing ovation. I guess they're done with their nonsense.

But then Ryan speaks into the microphone. “Before we get down, we’ve got one more song for you!”

More applause. More laughter. And I just want the ground to open up and swallow me.

Samantha looks at me with pity in her eyes. “Well… umm,” she says. “I’ll catch up with you later.”

She quickly excuses herself.

Behind me, I hear those interns whispering again. “Oh, my God. Did you hear what she said? That's Mrs. O’Brien.”

I turn to glare at them one last time, and the boy shifts uncomfortably, pulling the girl to her feet. “Let’s go,” he mutters under his breath, and they stumble away, sneaking a look at me before disappearing into the crowd.

Good. Let them run.

I turn back to the stage, my heart pounding in my chest. Ryan is singing “Everything I Do”—if you can call that singing. Emily is now pressed against him, her hand running up his arm in a way that makes my stomach twist. She’s completely shameless, and he’s too drunk to even notice—or worse, he doesn’t care.

I can’t take it anymore.

Without thinking, I push my chair back and stand. My heels click against the floor as I march toward the stage. I can feel the weight of everyone’s eyes on me, the whispers dying down as they realize what’s happening. They’ve been waiting for this—waiting to see if I’ll crack.

But I don’t care. I’m done playing the perfect wife.

I climb the steps to the stage, each footstep feeling heavier than the last. Ryan doesn’t notice me at first, too lost in his drunken performance, but Emily spots me and her smile falters. Good.

“Ryan,” I say. “We’re leaving now.”

Ryan looks at me, surprised. “Why?” he slurs, still holding the microphone. “The party's just getting started.”

I grit my teeth, my fists clenched. “Let’s go. Now.”

“Julie, come on,” he says, sounding annoyed now, as if I’m the one ruining his night.

I can’t help it. Something inside me snaps.

Without another word, I turn and walk toward the back of the stage. The technical operators sitting in the booth look up as I approach, their faces going pale.

“Who’s in charge here?” I ask.

They all point to a man standing near the soundboard, holding a half-eaten donut. His eyes widen as he sees me.

“Mrs. O’Brien,” he stammers, quickly setting the donut aside. “Is there something—uh—something I can do for you?”

“Shut it down. All of it,” I say. “The party’s over.”

He blinks, not sure if I’m serious, but one look at my face and he scrambles to obey. His hands fly across the controls, and within seconds, the speakers cut out with a harsh screech. The lights dim. The music dies. Silence falls over the room like a heavy curtain, and all that’s left is the sound of my heels as I walk back to center stage.

Ryan is standing there, his microphone useless in his hand.

“Julie, what the hell?” Ryan mutters.

I meet his eyes, feeling the weight of everything I’ve been holding in for too long. “You’ve had your fun,” I say quietly, but with enough steel in my voice that it stops him from saying anything else. “Now it’s over.”

I don’t wait for a reply. I grab his arm and start leading him down the stairs.

Ryan stumbles slightly, caught off guard by my sudden forcefulness. His eyes flick to the crowd, scanning their faces for something, maybe support, validation, but all he finds are wide eyes and muted whispers. Everyone’s too shocked, too entertained by the unfolding drama, to come to his defense.

The whispers start immediately. I hear snatches of conversation as we pass. Let them talk. Let them laugh.

Ryan's too drunk to fight me, too embarrassed to protest. For once, he’s the one who’s quiet, and I’m the one in control.

Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard/chauffeur, sees us coming and is already moving into action. He steps forward, opening the back door of the car without a word.

Ryan mumbles something under his breath—maybe an apology, maybe an excuse—but I don’t stop. I don’t even look at him. I tighten my grip, forcing him into the backseat with a firm push, and he collapses into the car.

“Take us home,” I say, climbing in behind Ryan. Then I slam the door shut.

It’s true what they say about marriage: one partner is always happier than the other.

In my case, I’m the unhappy one.

I’m the one who can’t sleep. I’m the one who watches her husband’s sleeping face at night, looking for a sign—anything to prove what I’ve suspected all along, that he’s cheating on me. Just say a word, goddammit, a name, something, dear God. That’s all I want. Say Emily, Ryan. Say Emily.

But Ryan never does. He’s too controlled for that.

I’m the one checking his phone, seeing notifications from the same person, the same tiny image. But I can’t see the name of the sender, can’t recognize the face due to the image size—though it looks like Emily. I can’t even read the messages because Ryan has privatized his pop-up notifications.

I’m in the kitchen right now, already on my fifth cup of coffee. And it’s just 6 AM.

“Morning,” Ryan says, walking in, rubbing his temple. “Feels like someone took a chainsaw to my head. Last night was fun.”

“I’m glad you had fun,” I reply, trying to keep my voice steady, but the bitterness slips through. He notices it, of course. He always does.

“Something wrong?” Ryan asks, eyeing me cautiously.

“Wrong?”

“You seem… I don’t know, off.”

I’m counting down from ten in my head. Calm down, Julie. Calm the hell down. But how can I? Ryan disgraced me last night, and he doesn’t even remember?

“I’m fine,” I say.

Ryan fetches himself a cup of coffee and joins me at the table. He’s watching me with that innocent look of his.

Sometimes I forget how handsome he is. With his lovely, sharp jawline and his bright green eyes. The eyes were the first thing I fell in love with. We were freshmen in college, and Ryan mistook me for some girl he brought to the frat party, a girl he swore was his girlfriend. And well, I played along. I enjoyed playing the part, letting him call me Vivian. And in the morning, when he was sober again and didn’t recognize me, I told him Vivian no longer wanted him and I did.

Funny how things turn out.

“You say you’re fine,” Ryan says, breaking the silence, “but you keep looking at me like you want to murder me.”

I grip the edge of the table, my nails digging into the wood. “You humiliated me last night, Ryan. How is anyone supposed to respect me when my own husband doesn’t?”

“What are you talking about?”

“I’m talking about your stupid karaoke performance yesterday with that bitch, Emily.”

Ryan slaps his forehead dramatically. “Oh, not this again. I’ve told you a hundred times, Julie, there’s nothing to worry about. You always bring her up, like you’re obsessed or something.”

“Obsessed?”

I want to throw my coffee cup at something, and it definitely isn’t the wall.

“You have a life most women would kill for,” he continues. “A great job, a husband who comes home every night. Do you know how many women throw themselves at me? And yet, I come home to you. I pay your family’s bills. I’ve set up trust funds for your nieces and nephews. But it’s never enough, is it? You’re always whining about the same thing—Emily this, Emily that. It’s exhausting.”

I’m shaking now, my heart pounding so hard I can barely breathe. But if I say anything more, he’ll call my mother again, and she’ll tell me I’m being ungrateful. “Stop trying to push Ryan into divorcing you, Julie,” she’ll say. “No one wants hand-me-downs. Do you want to be alone forever? Go on your knees and tell Ryan you’re sorry for being a bitch.”

“How would you like me to show my gratitude, my lord?” I say, glaring at Ryan. “Should I commission a carven image of you and worship it?”

“I’m not in the mood for your sarcasm, Julie. My head is already pounding enough.” Then something crosses his eyes, a strange look. “Actually, there’s something I’ve been meaning to discuss with you. I feel like now’s the right time.”

Oh, God. My stomach tightens. He’s going to ask for a divorce. I can feel it. Mom’s going to kill me. She already planned a vacation in Rio in December.

“What is it?” I ask, bracing myself.

“I want an open marriage.”

For a moment, the words don’t register. “What?” I say.

“That’s when a couple decides to give each other room to see other people, and—”

“I know what an open marriage means, Ryan. Jesus Christ. The answer is no.”

He looks at me with disdain. “I wasn’t asking. From now on, we’re in an open marriage. When you see me with someone else, don’t bother asking questions.”

My heart slams in my chest. “It’s only an open marriage if I agree. And I don’t.”

I’m on my feet now, pacing the kitchen, trying to contain the rage and hurt boiling inside me. Seven years of marriage, and I’m already gearing close to a heart attack.

“I want kids, Julie,” Ryan says. “How am I supposed to have any if I don’t date someone else?”

I can’t help it; I begin to cry. “But it’s not my fault.”

“It’s not my fault either. Maybe it’s just us together.”

I can’t believe he said that. We’ve tried for seven years, spent a lot of money. And it’s always the same reply: you’re both healthy. The embryos are just acting weird. Nine IVFs.

I untie my robe and let it fall to the floor, stripping down until I’m standing naked in front of him. Ryan’s eyes widen in surprise.

I move closer and straddle him. I then grab his hand and place it on my chest. “Does this not move you anymore?”

“Julie—”

“Am I ugly to you now?” I reach into his pants, but he quickly stands, pushing me away.

“Stop it,” he says firmly, putting space between us. “Put your clothes back on.”

Trembling, I watch as he walks away, heading for the stairs.

“Wait,” I call out, my voice shaky.

Ryan turns, impatient. “What?”

“It’s cool,” I say, my voice hollow. “Let’s have an open marriage.”

Ryan nods. “Good.”

And just like that, he walks away, leaving me in a million pieces.

\~\~

I like to say I’m a calm person. Sometimes I swear I’m the most level-headed person I know. All my family are maniacs. My sisters, my brothers. My parents. I’ve always been the one bailing people out of prison. I’ve been the designated driver during college wild night parties. I’ve been the cover-up story for my friends in high school. Yeah, everyone claimed they were spending the night at Julie’s house. Because their parents knew I’m a decent person.

But for the first time in my life, I think I want to kill someone.

I’m watching our driveway from the window, and Ryan is stepping out of his car with none other than Emily. Fucking Emily. And she’s carrying suitcases.

“What’s going on?” I ask as soon as Ryan and Emily step into the house.

Ryan smiles. “Julie, meet Emily.”

“I know who she is, Ryan.”

“Good. Then I won’t need to explain. Emily’s moving in.”

I’m honestly too stunned to speak. What does he mean by that? After what feels like ages, I ask, “Is she homeless?”

“No,” Ryan says. “She’s my girlfriend now.”

I look at Ryan, then Emily. “I don’t understand.”

Ryan doesn’t even look at me, just grabs Emily’s hand and starts leading her away. “Stop being such a bad host, Julie. We’ve had a long day.”

“No way, Ryan. She’s not staying in this house,” I say, my voice shaking with disbelief.

He doesn’t respond. They’re already halfway up the stairs.

“Do you hear me? She’s not staying here! Take her back to wherever you picked her up. I don’t want her in my house.”

Ryan stops, turning just enough to glare at me. “Your house? I put a roof over your head. If I say she’s staying, she’s staying. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. I don’t have the energy for your nonsense, Julie.”

Oh, my god. My chest tightens. “How could you do this?” I say. “Don’t walk away from me, Ryan. Stand here and answer me.”

Emily turns to look at me, smirking. “By the way, you’ll need to move your things into the guest room. I’m not sharing a bed with you and Ryan. It’s bad enough sharing him with you.”

All the energy in me evaporates. I just stand there, speechless. I can’t move. I can’t breathe. I hear them whispering and giggling as they head into our bedroom. My room. They’re kicking me out of my own room.

The living room suddenly feels too small.

I stumble to the front door, fling it open, and run outside, needing to escape. I don’t know where I’m going, but I can’t be here.

“Ma’am, are you alright?” Justin, Ryan’s bodyguard, asks as I approach, breathless. He’s wiping down Ryan’s Rolls-Royce, eyeing me with concern.

I hold out my hand. “The keys.”

“Ma’am?”

“The damn keys, Justin.”

He hesitates for a second, but hands them over. I know he’s wondering why I need Ryan’s car when I have my own. Honestly, I don’t know either. But if I stay here for one more second, I might lose it completely.

“Mrs. O’Brien, let me drive you—”

“No, Justin. I’ll drive myself.”

I pull out of the driveway and speed off into the night.

\~\~

It’s been over an hour, and I’m still driving aimlessly. My mind is a blur of everything—Ryan, Emily, their smug faces. Initially, I’d planned a Saturday evening manicure and pedicure, just to get my mind off things. Things that involve Ryan. But I’m no longer in the mood to get my feet and hands pampered. It’s not even been two days since he dropped that bombshell about an open marriage, almost giving me a heart attack, and now he’s bringing his mistress over? Emily? The same Emily?

The craziest thing is I can’t cry. I feel nothing. No tears, no anger—just this hollow emptiness. The last therapist I spoke with said it’s a defense mechanism. That I’m in denial of my actual emotions. Cry it out, Julie, she used to say. Let yourself be free of the burden.

Well, they can all go to hell. Ryan. Emily. The therapist. My entire family.

I know what I need. A drink.

I pull into the nearest bar and head inside.

“A shot of whiskey,” I tell the bartender. “Neat. And keep them coming.”

“Long night?”

“I don’t want to talk about it,” I say.

He pours the first shot, and I throw it back, welcoming the burn in my throat. It’s harsh, but it’s better than the alternative—thinking about what’s happening back home.

As I down my second shot, I hear someone call out, “Maggie! Maggie!”

I turn, confused, and see a tall, handsome man approaching me, his eyes locked on mine. Before I can react, he’s wrapping his arms around me. “Thank God I found you,” he says, pulling me into a tight hug.

I stiffen. “Who the hell are you?”

“Please, just go along with it,” he whispers in my ear. “I’ll explain later. I promise.”

Before I can push him away, a furious-looking woman storms over.

“Luke! I knew it. You can’t hide from me.”

The stranger—Luke, apparently—turns to face her, still keeping his arm around me. “Veronica, what a surprise,” he says, feigning nonchalance.

“My name isn’t Veronica, it’s Evelyn.”

Luke flashes her a sheepish smile. “Right, sorry. I get those mixed up sometimes. Anyway, this is Maggie—my wife.”

He lifts my hand, showing off my wedding ring, and I nearly choke. What is happening?

Evelyn glares at me. “You married this scumbag?”

I don’t know what to say, so I just nod.

“You should divorce him,” she snaps. “He spends one night with you and disappears the next. Who does that?”

“But that's what we agreed on. A one-night st—” Luke begins, but Evelyn cuts him off.

“Fuck you, Luke.”

And with that, she storms off, leaving the two of us standing there, stunned.

Luke breathes a sigh of relief. “Well, that one was a stalker. At least she's off my back now.” He turns to me, smiling. “Can I buy you a drink? You’ve definitely earned it.”

I stare at him and then stare at the spot where the angry lady once stood. It all happened so fast. I can't even process it. I think I need that drink.

“Make it two,” I say.

And Luke smiles.

Lord knows I’ve seen my fair share of beauties.

But the lady beside me is something else. Not only is she the prettiest thing I’ve seen, but she’s married. Some men are just lucky.

“So, I’m guessing your name isn’t Maggie?” I ask, trying to ease the tension.

“No,” she replies flatly.

I nod, waiting for her to give me something more. “So, what is it?”

She gives me a slow, deliberate look. I can’t lie, wherever her eyes touch immediately burns.

“Look,” I say, raising my hands in mock surrender. “I’m not hitting on you. Honestly, I’m taking a break from women. They’re problematic.”

She lets out a laugh, a bitter one. “You’re the one who just hugged a stranger to dodge another woman you’ve clearly wronged, and you’re saying we’re the problematic ones? You men are all the same.”

She downs her drink like it’s water and winces at the burn. That’s her second shot in less than five minutes. I’ve got to say, I’m impressed.

“Let’s start over,” I suggest, offering her a fresh start. “I’m Luke.”

She rolls her eyes. “Yeah, I caught that. Your ‘problematic’ ex wouldn’t shut up about it.”

“She's not my ex,” I say.

“Whatever.”

Great, another woman convinced I’m the villain. Not even five minutes in and she’s already pegged me as the problem. I guess I deserve that one.

“So, are you going to tell me your name?” I ask, trying again.

I can tell she’s got money just by looking at her. She’s probably an heiress or the wife of some big-shot businessman. Those Louboutins, the Rolls-Royce keys sitting on the bar, and that dress—all of it screams wealth. Maybe that’s why she’s not keen on giving me her real name.

“You don’t have to tell me your last name,” I say with a grin. “But you look like you could use someone to talk to. Since you just saved my ass back there, I figure it’s the least I can do.”

She watches me for a moment, her expression unreadable, before finally relenting. “Julie. My name’s Julie.”

“Nice to meet you, Julie,” I say, extending my hand.

She takes it.

\~\~

Julie’s on her fifth glass of whiskey, and at this point, she’s unstoppable, pouring out her life story like we’ve known each other for years. I’ve already told the bartender to cut her off, but she hasn’t noticed yet.

“...So, I’m standing there, and they’re both going upstairs. To my room. And do you know what the bitch says?” Julie doesn’t wait for me to reply. “She says I need to move out of my room. My room.” She laughs so hard that she starts coughing. And then, just as suddenly, she’s sobbing.

I don’t know what to do. How do you comfort someone else’s wife without crossing a line?

“Julie,” I say. “Are you okay?”

She shakes her head. “I need another drink.”

“No, you don’t.”

She frowns at me. “What? You think I need one more person telling me how to live my life? You can all go to hell. I said I need a drink.” She taps her empty glass against the bar, but the bartender, Mart, knows better than to disobey me.

“Sorry, I own the bar, and I can’t let you drink anymore,” I say.

Her eyes narrow. “Oh, you own the bar? Good for you. I’ll find another one.”

She tries to stand, but I step in her path.

“Listen, Julie, I know you’re hurting, but this isn't the way to go about it. Have you thought about divorce?”

For the first time, her eyes soften, and she slumps back onto the barstool. “I can’t. I don’t want to be a disappointment to my family. They depend on Ryan’s money.”

I let out a snort. “Screw them. It’s your life. No one should make you feel like this.”

She gives a sarcastic smile. “Easy for you to say, Mr. I-own-the-bar.”

I’ve seen people like Julie before, people who won’t leave a toxic relationship because, deep down, they still love the person. She’s saying it’s because of her family, but I can tell it’s more than that. She’s not ready to let go of him. Love does that to you—it makes you hold on even when you shouldn’t. I know that feeling all too well.

What kind of solution could I possibly suggest that wouldn’t involve me physically dragging her out of the marriage?

Suddenly, an idea hits me. “You know what?” I say. “You need to get yourself a boyfriend. Someone to introduce to Ryan.”

“A boyfriend?” She looks at me like I’ve lost my mind.

It sounds like a stupid plan, but one thing I know about guys who cheat is that they can't stand being cheated on. It’ll drive him crazy. I’m hoping it leads to Ryan divorcing her, since she’s too chicken to do it herself.

“It doesn’t have to be a real relationship,” I add. “Just hire someone to play that role until Ryan comes back to his senses.”

Julie’s quiet for a moment, turning the idea over in her head. “That’s actually not bad,” she says, surprising me. “Are all bar owners this good at giving advice?”

I laugh. “We try.”

“Okay, but where am I supposed to find this ‘boyfriend’?”

Without thinking, I blurt out, “I could do it.”

Her eyes flicker over me again, slower this time. “You?”

“It’s easier than hiring someone. No need to go through the hassle of finding the right guy, making sure he knows what he’s doing. I’m single, not looking for a relationship, and I like a little adventure. I’d be perfect for the job.”

She studies me, weighing her options. After a moment, she says, “You are good-looking too.”

I raise an eyebrow, but she cuts me off.

“Don’t ask.” She pulls out her phone. “So, how much is this going to cost me?”

I hadn’t thought about money. I don’t need it, but if I offer to do it for free, it might seem weird.

“How much are you willing to pay?” I ask, playing along.

She glances around the bar, one arm raised as if to appraise the place. Her diamond ring catches the light, sparkling like it’s worth a fortune.

“Your bar’s decent,” she says. “What does it make? Two hundred thousand a year? Maybe five?”

I stay silent.

“I’ll double that,” she says.

I raise an eyebrow. “The two hundred?”

“The five hundred.”

Wow. She’s serious. “Deal. But I’ll only take the money after we pull it off.”

She extends her hand. “Deal.”

I shake her hand, her skin soft against mine. I then pull out a pen and scribble my number on a napkin. “Call me when you’re ready.”

She tucks the napkin into her purse and gives me one last look before heading out of the bar. I'm right behind her, escorting her toward a sleek Rolls-Royce.

“You sure you can drive?” I ask.

“I’m not that high, Luke.”

“Alright,” I say. “Give me a call.”

She drives off into the night.

I feel so guilty for letting her leave in that state. But what else could I do? I head back into the bar, already wondering what I’ve gotten myself into.",1,1749882969.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Out of nowhere,a little boy ran up,hugged my fiancé’s leg and called him“Daddy.”

I thought it was someone doing pranks,but then my fiancésmiled tenderly,scooped the kid up in his arms and said,“I just found out,”he said softly.“When Lana and I broke up five years ago,she was already pregnant.She came back recently,a single mom with a kid.People will [talk.So](http://talk.so/),I’ll give them a proper status.”

Before I could say anything,Lana Pierce walked over.Micah Langston—my fiancé—interlocked his fingers with hers,looking like the happiest man on earth.

I asked calmly,“what about us?”

Micah replied,“I have to marry [Lana.As](http://lana.as/) for us…”

Lana cut in with a sugary smile.“Since you’re already here,why don’t you take a photo and post it on your socials?That way your friends will think you still got married today.”

Then she actually pulled out her phone,pointed it at us and chirped,“Say cheese!”

Micah tried to reassure me.“Don’t worry,Riley.I still love you.Lana’s like family.And the kid…I just feel bad for him.Growing up without a dad can really mess a kid up.I just want to be there for him.Let’s put our wedding on hold.When he’s older,we’ll explain everything.I promise I’ll give you the big wedding you deserve.”

And just like that,the three of them walked off hand-in-hand to get their marriage certificate.

I pulled out my phone and called Asher Lane—the guy who’s been chasing me for ten years.

“I’m outside City Hall and in need of a marriage certificate.Want to be my husband?”

——

“You’re asking me to marry you?You’re full of surprises,Miss Vaughn,”he said,stunned.“I literally just got off a flight.I’m out of the country right now.”

“Never mind then.”

But before I could hang up,his tone shifted—suddenly urgent.“Wait!Don’t move.I’ll be back before the place closes.Whoever bails is a chicken!”

After hanging up,I let out a long breath.Guess I’d better find somewhere to wait.

That’s when I heard someone call out sharply,“Riley Vaughn!”

I turned [around.It](http://around.it/) was Micah.He must’ve already gotten their license.He had the kid in one arm and was holding Lana’s hand with the other.Picture-perfect little family.

He came up to me,looking irritated.“Why are you still here?”

“I’m waiting for someone,”I said honestly.“To get a marriage certificate with.”

He rolled his eyes.“You don’t have to be sarcastic.I already told you—I only just found out about the kid.Don’t you understand?”

I nodded.“I understand.”

Micah stepped closer and lowered his voice.“Then please,just go home.I don’t want to cause a scene in front of the child.”

I brushed his hand off my arm.“I’m serious.I’m actually waiting for someone—to get married.”

His face darkened.“Riley,this is your last warning.Keep acting like this and I swear,I’ll start to really hate you.”

Lana stepped forward with a sweet,concerned look on her face.“Are you upset because you didn’t get your marriage certificate,Riley?”she asked gently.

She pulled hers from her bag and held it out.“Here.Take a photo with mine.The covers are all the same—no one will know it’s not yours unless they open it.”

I didn’t take it.The booklet dropped to the ground.

Lana crouched down,her eyes glistening as she picked it up.Her voice trembling.

“I’m sorry.I shouldn’t have come back with the child.”

Chapter 2

Micah shot me a glare and said coldly,“Riley,I didn’t know you were this petty.If you can’t accept Lana,then we’re done!”

I said,“Okay.”

My calm response caught him off guard.

Lana quickly leaned down and nudged the boy toward me.“Go on,sweetheart.Say hi to this lady and tell her not to be upset.”

“No!”the boy shouted.“She’s a bad woman!A homewrecker!”

Then,out of nowhere,he shoved me hard.“You steal my daddy!”

People started staring.Some even looked disgusted.I heard someone mutter,“Wow,side chicks are really bold these days—coming to the courthouse to steal someone’s husband.”

I looked at the boy and said gently,“Don’t worry.Your dad and I broke up.He’s all yours now.I wish your parents a lifetime of happiness.”

Micah nodded in approval.“That’s more like it.Keep being sensible like this.”

Then he walked off with Lana and the boy,like the perfect little family.

As I watched his back,I thought,‘That wasn’t me being‘sensible.’I meant every word.’

I found a nearby caféand sat down to wait for Asher.

While I was sipping my coffee,a news alert popped up on my phone.

“Breaking News:Lane Group’s representation walks out mid-signing at international contract ceremony.”

My heart skipped a beat.

Lane Group’s representation?Could it be Asher?

I clicked the link and sure enough—a video popped up.

It showed a tall,handsome man walking away mid-meeting,phone to his ear.

It was indeed Asher.

I could even faintly hear him say,“Whoever bails is a chicken.”

Then came a clip of a reporter interviewing the other party involved in the signing.“Mr.Lane left [midway.Do](http://midway.do/) you take that as a sign of disrespect?”

The man being interviewed,an older white gentleman,just shrugged and smiled.“All I can say is—love comes first.I don’t feel disrespected at all.Actually,I admire Mr.Lane’s for [it.It](http://it.it/) aligns perfectly with our values.We’ll wait for him to come back.This won’t affect our partnership in any way.”

I put my phone down,feeling overwhelmed.

Asher Lane had chased me for ten years—always putting me first,always loving me with everything he had.

But I was so caught up in Micah,I never gave him a real chance.

Now that I was done with Micah,I could finally see things clearly.

When I compared the two,it hit me—Asher’s love was real.Micah’s was nothing but empty promises.

I opened my inbox and started reading through Asher’s old emails.

Every message was filled with warmth and sincerity.Back then I thought he was being clingy…now I realized they were love letters.

Letter after letter,full of love I never noticed.

My heart ached a [little.How](http://little.how/) did he manage to keep loving me all those years?

I read them all and before I knew it,the sun was starting to set.

Then suddenly—a bouquet of flowers appeared in front of me.

I looked up and saw Asher,standing there with the biggest grin.

“Sorry I kept you waiting,wifey,”he said.

That word caught me off [guard.It](http://guard.it/) felt strange but…not weird.

Asher noticed my silence and looked a little nervous.“Don’t tell me you’ve changed your mind?”

I smiled at him.“Relax.I’m not a chicken.”

We walked back into the courthouse,side by side and got our license.

I knew there were still people waiting for him across the ocean,so I encouraged him to head back soon.

Chapter 3

Asher pulled me into a tight hug.“When I get back,we’ll have the wedding.And just so you know—whoever backs out is a chicken.”

I watched him walk away,unable to stop a bitter smile from curling at my lips.This was the great Asher Lane—confident,commanding,practically royalty in the business world.And yet,so insecure when it came to love?

It was already getting dark when I finally made my way home,cradling the bouquet of flowers he gave me.

What I didn’t expect was the scene waiting for me on the other side of the door.

Lana.And her son.

She was lounging on my couch,in my pajamas,casually watching TV.Her son,shoes on and all,was bouncing like a maniac on the designer couch I’d painstakingly chosen—leaving muddy footprints all over the upholstery.That couch cost over ten grand.

I felt rage rising in my chest,boiling over—but before I could say a word,Micah walked out of the kitchen.

His brows furrowed in confusion.“Why are you back?”

I choked on my anger for a moment before I forced out a cold reply,“Pretty sure this is still my place.”

The boy suddenly chucked his toy at me.“This is my dad’s house.It’s our house.Get out!”

I was stunned.Lana,completely unfazed,just smiled sweetly and said,“Oh Riley,don’t mind [him.Kids](http://him.kids/) don’t know any better.”

Then she walked over and,without asking,snatched the flowers from my hands.“Are these for me and Micah?That’s so thoughtful of you.Thanks for the well wishes.”

I tried to take the bouquet back,but her son yanked it away.He threw it to the ground,stomped on it hard and spat,“We don’t want your stupid flowers.Stop trying to suck up to my mom!”

I was so furious my head started to throb.“You better pay for that bouquet!”

Micah snapped,clearly annoyed.“He’s just a [kid.Gosh.How](http://kid.gosh.how/) can you stoop to his level?”

Then he did the unthinkable—he handed me an apron.“Just go cook dinner.Don’t provoke him.”

I let out a disbelieving laugh.“I’m sorry,am I your servant,now?How dare you telling me to cook?”

“Could you just stop being difficult?”Micah scowled.“Ever since we left the City Hall,you’ve been nothing but dramatic.”

He kept going,voice sharp.“Everything was fine until you showed up and threw it all into chaos.I’m trying to help you here.Just cook something—as a gesture for Lana and her kid.”

I locked eyes with [him.My](http://him.my/) voice was low and steady.“You really think I’m the one who ruined everything—that I should apologize?”

His gaze wavered.

But then he sighed.“Look,the kid’s innocent.You’re the adult here.Can’t you just take the high road for once?I know it’s uncomfortable,but I’ll make it up to you,okay?”

Something inside me snapped.

“Why does it always have to be me who suffers?”I asked softly.“Was I not innocent too?”

His gaze wavered.

Before he could respond,the boy came out of nowhere with a dinner fork and jabbed it into my thigh.

“Get out!You don’t belong here!”he screamed.

I shoved him away,hard.“This house is mine.I paid for it.If anyone’s leaving,it’s you.”

He burst into tears and ran straight into Lana’s arms.

I had bought this house to start a life with Micah after we got married.But clearly,he’d forgotten that.Instead,he’d decided it would be just the perfect little love nest for him,another woman and her child.

Lana wiped at her fake tears,looking tragically heartbroken.“I’m sorry.We shouldn’t have come.We should probably leave now.”

But Micah stepped in immediately,stopping her.He looked genuinely upset.

Then he turned to me,anger flaring in his eyes.“It’s already dark out.Where can she go with a kid at this hour?Can’t you show a little compassion?”

I let out a heavy sigh.“Fine.But they’re gone by morning—or I’m calling the cops.”

Micah’s jaw clenched.“If you’re really going to throw them out…then I’ll leave too.”

Chapter 4

I let out a hollow laugh.“Please do.”

I opened the bedroom door,just wanting to crash and forget this nightmare.

But the moment I walked in,I stopped cold.

The bedsheets were crumpled.The blanket had been used.And under my pillow,there it was—women’s underwear.Not mine.

A wave of nausea hit me.

Lana had already slept in my bed?

I grabbed my essentials,didn’t even glance at the people in the living room and stormed out.

I slammed the door behind me.Hard.

I’d stay at a hotel tonight.That place felt dirty now.Tomorrow,I’d bring in a cleaning crew.Maybe even throw out the bed.

The day had drained every ounce of energy out of me.After washing up at the hotel,I collapsed on the bed—only for my phone to buzz.

A friend request.

I accepted without thinking.

Then came the photos.

Every single one showed Micah and Lana,in my house,tangled up in each other on what was supposed to be our marital bed.

The last image came with a message.\[Smart women know when to quit.\]

I replied:\[And some are into leftovers.I’m more than happy to hand him over.\]

Then I turned off my phone and went to sleep.

When I woke,the sun was already up.I ate breakfast,then went back to my house to reclaim what was mine.But when I opened the front door,I froze again.

Balloons.Streamers.Posters on the walls.

Micah and Lana’s wedding photos,everywhere.

Strangers—people I didn’t recognize—were lounging on my couch,raiding my fridge,drinking from my mugs.

My bookshelf had been ransacked.Files scattered everywhere.The antique ornaments I’d bought at auctions and the heirloom gifts from my parents—manhandled and some already shattered.

I forced myself to stay calm and turned off their loud music.

They all turned to look at me,annoyed.

“Who are you?”I asked coldly.“What are you doing in my house?”

They exchanged confused glances.“Your house?You mean Lana’s house?”

“We’re here for the wedding.Who the hell are you?”the other added.

I almost choked on my own fury.“Micah and Lana…are holding a wedding here?!”

Then someone pointed at me.“I know her.Guys,she’s that mistress!”

Before I could say anything,someone flung a cup of milk tea in my face.

“You’ve got some nerve showing up here.Trying to ruin the wedding,you homewrecker?”

More people joined in—slapping,kicking,screaming at me.

I fought back,but there were too many.

I was shoved to the ground.

They got braver,crueler.

Someone hit me.Someone tried to rip my clothes.Others livestreamed the whole thing,wanting the whole internet to“see what a mistress looks like.”

I covered my face,but they grabbed my hands and yanked them away.

They pinned my limbs down and hung a pair of heels around my neck.Then they spat in my face,mocking me,calling me cheap,shameless and other names.

I sobbed,helpless and humiliated,as they used my pain for entertainment.

Until suddenly—someone shouted,“The groom’s here!”

They backed off and rushed to the door.

I scrambled to my feet,barely able to stand.

And there they were—Micah in a sharp suit,Lana in a wedding gown.

Micah saw me,disheveled and broken.He hesitated,then walked over.

Leaning in,he whispered,“I thought you left.This is not a real wedding.We’re just putting on a show…for the kid.”

Chapter 5

My voice was cold.“Oh,I [see.So](http://see.so/) the bruises on my face and the shattered antiques—those are all just props for your little show?”

Micah frowned,clearly not happy with my reaction.

Before he could say anything,their friends swarmed around us.

“Micah,this mistress has some nerve showing up here like this,”one of them sneered.“You should slap her—make it up to Lana.”

Micah didn’t move.

But Lana was staring at him expectantly.

Micah turned to me instead.“Just leave,okay?”

“Why should I?”I asked coldly.“And mistress?Tell me,Micah—am I a mistress?”

Someone nearby scoffed and spat at the ground near my feet.“Micah has a wife and kid.What else would that make you?”

I stared at Micah with fire in my eyes.“Well?”

Micah’s voice was low.“No.”

Gasps rippled through the crowd.Chaos erupted as everyone started shouting in Lana’s defense.

Micah tried to calm them down.“No,it’s not what you think,guys.She and I…we’re just friends.She’s not a mistress.We barely even know each other.”

I let out a disbelieving laugh.“Not even friends?Really,Micah?Then tell me—why are you holding your wedding in my house?”

Someone near me kicked my leg.“Your house?This is Micah and Lana’s home,you delusional gold digger.”

“Typical homewrecker.”

“People like her should be paraded through the streets.”

They hurled insults like it was a sport.

I pulled out my phone and started dialing the police.

But Micah lunged forward,yanked it from my hand and hung up.

“Riley,”he said in a low voice.“Just…let today happen,okay?After this,you can do whatever the hell you want”

I opened my mouth to argue—but then a voice I recognized cut in.

“Just listen,Riley.Don’t make a [scene.It](http://scene.it/) won’t help you.”

I turned around and froze.

It was Micah’s mother.

She used to treat me like her own daughter—always warm,always kind.She once told Micah that if he ever dared mistreat me,she’d be the first to object.

Yet here she was,attending his wedding…to another woman.

She dragged me into the bathroom,locked the door and said,“Don’t worry,honey.I’ll make sure you’re treated fairly.Micah didn’t even know you when Lana got pregnant.Technically,it’s not cheating.Let them get married.Then they can get divorced.Better to be with a divorced dad than a man with an illegitimate child,right?”

I couldn’t help but laugh.“Do you think I still want to be with Micah?Mrs.Langston,he’s free to marry whoever he wants—I couldn’t care less.But this is my house.I’m only asking him to leave.And of course,he’ll be paying for all the damage done here today.”

Micah’s mom froze.

She stared at me like she didn’t recognize me anymore.“But…don’t you love Micah?”she asked,still in disbelief.“You were willing to do anything for him.I remember you standing outside my door for three hours after he broke up with you.”

Chapter 6

“Riley,Micah only married Lana to give her status.It’s not like they’ll really be together.Why are you blowing this out of proportion?”she sounded impatient.

Hearing her dig up the past twisted something deep inside me.

Hearing her bring up the past made something twist in my chest.

God,I’d been so blind.

I was the one with money,the one from a good family—and yet I bent over backwards for Micah,terrified of upsetting him.I gave everything and asked for nothing.

Micah had me all figured out.The more I gave,the more he took.

He made me feel small,worthless—always threatening to leave me if I didn’t play by his rules.And stupid me,I played right into his hands.I clung to him harder.

That’s probably why he had the nerve to marry Lana right under my nose.

He must’ve thought I was fully‘tamed.’

I’d never been in love before [him.So](http://him.so/) I thought loving someone meant putting their happiness above everything.

But what I never realized—until now—is that real love isn’t about losing yourself.It’s about being happy,too.

With that thought,I turned to Micah’s mom and smiled politely.“That was then.This is now.And if I don’t get a satisfaction answers,I’m calling the cops on everyone.”

I opened the door and stepped out.

Behind me,Micah’s mom snapped,“Riley,you better think this through.Everyone here saw you playing the homewrecker today.Whether it’s true or not,your reputation’s shot.And when that happens,we won’t agree to it even if you fall to your knees and cry blood begging to get back together and marry Micah.”

I spun around and shot back,“Oh,don’t worry about that.I’m already married.”

I bent down to pick up my phone from the ground,ready to call the cops.

But Micah grabbed my wrist.

He looked at me coldly and said,“You’re really determined to ruin my wedding with Lana,aren’t you?Fine then.I won’t protect you anymore.”

He shoved me hard and I fell to the ground.Then he turned to the onlookers and said loudly,“Drag her into the guest room.Don’t let her cause any more trouble.”

In an instant,seven or eight men surrounded me.Their faces lit up with excitement as they dragged me toward the guest room.

We hadn’t even made it inside when their hands started wandering.If they managed to get me through that door,I knew exactly what would happen.

I fought back with everything I had,but I was no match for them.

And then the front door slammed open.

A man’s furious voice echoed through the room.“Touch my wife and you’re dead!”

Tears immediately streamed down my face.

1lb21dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1lb21dg/how_can_i_secure_my_cat_carrier_to_my_car/,How can I secure my cat carrier to my car?,"I have 2 cats, 5M and 3F. I am moving in a couple of weeks and I will have to drive 5 hours with both of my cats while my husband drives behind me so we can keep the car running if I need a bathroom or coffee break. I am also giving them gabapentin for the drive per the vets suggestion. 

A big concern of mine is keeping them secure in their carriers. I’ve only ever taken them to the vet thats 15 minutes away, and only ever took them one at a time. So I usually just put them on the floor of the passenger side while I’m driving. I’d like to put them in the backseat for the drive so I can add fans to the front car seats and increase air flow for them. I don’t want to put them on the floor in the backseats as I want to make sure they’re getting AC and the fans are hitting them. I added a link below to the kind of carrier each of my cats have (big enough for them to have water in there and also be able to move around).

Just wrapped up a week of night shifts, so a bit weary but keen to connect! I've met some genuinely great people here lately, and I'm always open to finding more easy, authentic friendships.

I'm looking for comfortable, everyday chats with a few more people (especially if you're in your 30s) – sharing passions, daily life, maybe even big dreams. Mutual understanding, a good sense of humor, and genuine interest go a long way. Pretty easy-going.

Life's a bit busy at the moment – I've just started house hunting again, which is always an adventure! And on the goal front, I'm looking at doing a charity run event soon, which is both exciting and a little daunting.

Alongside those, my usual interests include: writing, art (especially portraits lately), reading, travel, gym time (definitely need that with the run training!), video games (currently enjoying Skin Deep), learning French/Japanese, and the essentials: coffee & tea.

If you value real connection, can appreciate both deep chats and light moments, and enjoy a laugh or offering a supportive ear, I'd love to hear from you. Tell me a bit about yourself, what you're passionate about, or perhaps a challenge you're currently tackling.

1lb1zwa,https://i.redd.it/cfxxvt6d7u6f1.jpeg,Starbucks Indian Estates Blend,"Hear me out. Yes the roast is incredibly oily, not at all the dark roast they claim it is, but I got good coffee out of it.

Initially while dialing in, the shots were really burnt. Like the flavor literally hits you in the throat.

But I found a somewhat right grind setting and the shot was a bit fast so I added more coffee, barely pulling 1:2 in 25 secs.

And it was delicious. The coffee was chocolaty, bold but not bitter, and no burnt flavor at all.

I am most definitely not buying Starbucks again (unless I find a kenya roast with a recent date on discount) but you can make good coffee out of it. At least this one did.

I looked at the clock on my bedroom wall. I think I have delayed the inevitable for as long as I physically can. I should go to the packhouse to go and wish our pack's upcoming Alpha a happy birthday. The bane of my life. My brother’s best friend. One day to be Alpha Miles. Today he will turn 17, and meet his Alpha wolf. In all honesty, he was egotistical enough, thinking the world revolved around him, without him adding to that by finally gaining his wolf. Not your run-of-the-mill werewolf either. Oh no, Miles Davenport was destined to be an Alpha, so he would have a strong and powerful Alpha wolf, only adding to his arrogance and strength.

The crazy thing is, Miles had once upon a time been one of my closet friends too. In my younger childhood... Friends, that kind of thing comes when your father is the Beta to the Alpha. The children spend a lot of time together, and become friends. My older brother, Jordan, became the wing-man to Miles. His closest friend and ally, who as his Beta when the time came, was only right. But as the years went on, the friendship between Miles and I changed.

Friendship faded as he grew into a more popular sports star of our school. At the end of the day, he was always going to be popular, he was the upcoming Alpha after all, but as one of the top sports stars too, he was idolized. As was my brother. All the girls in school flocked around them like they were pop stars or something, and it was bizarre. I was nothing more to him now but a source of amusement for him and his sports buddies. A geek. Not one of the beauty queens who followed him around. Simply someone to make fun of.

I had gone from enjoying time with my one-day Alpha, to hating him, in the space of a school year. He thought he was god’s gift, and in all honesty, if he was, he is a gift I would return…

“Bailey!” I heard my Mum call from downstairs, telling me I was definitely running it close now for time. I know Jordan had already headed over to the packhouse a while ago with my Dad to meet his friend and our Alpha.

“I know.” I yelled back, looking at the books on my desk, desperate to continue with the assignment I was working on. I would so much rather continue working on the assignment and gain the additional credit available, work toward going to the college I want to go to instead of going to a party for the big-headed bully, I got to consider almost family, considering he was the son of my Dad’s best friend.

I stood from my seat, and walked to my mirror, adjusting my black skater dress I had chosen to wear today. Something plain and simple, easy to blend into the background, but a dress all the same if anyone asked why I hadn’t made an effort. Along with my chunky black sandals, I looked presentable, not that anyone would be looking at me. Today, all eyes would be on the birthday boy, as they always were. He would make sure of that. I flicked back my curly brown hair, before I walked out of the door, already dreading the hours that lay ahead…

My Mum pulled the car into the parking spaces outside the packhouse, while my younger sister Morgan was flicking at the curls around my head, simply trying to irritate me. She knew I would rather be anywhere but here right now, and was loving every last moment of it. “Aww, you want to go home Bailey-boo?” she teased.

“Stop you two, come on, your Dad is waiting inside. Let us go and find the birthday boy.” Mum says, sounding cheerful, completely oblivious to the fact how horrendous this party had the potential to be. She, too, worshiped Miles. Having seen him grow up alongside my brother, she seemed to think the sun shone out of his rear-end. It had always driven me insane.

“He won’t even notice us there.” I muttered under my breath as I followed her up the steps of the back house, shaking my head at my sister and how overdressed she looked. She definitely looked like she was out to impress someone today. A small part of me wondered if she hoped she might be the fated mate of Miles. After all, he was meeting his Alpha wolf today. He will have shifted for the first time today, and today could potentially be the day he can sense his fated mate out there waiting for him! There had been so much buzz around school about this, so many of the girls were excited about the potential possibility they could be his fated mate. The one chosen for him by the moon goddess. The one destined to be with him. So many of them are desperate for it to be them. While there I was desperate for anything but. I could think of nothing worse! Yet, looking at the amount of effort my younger sister had made today, I am beginning to think she was one of the many she-wolves that was holding out that hope…

We walked through the corridors of the packhouse, and it was filled with various pack members. Today was a day of celebration within pack, the birthday of the upcoming Alpha. And not just any birthday, the day he came of age. The day he met his Alpha wolf. The walls of the packhouse were adorned with decorations, music was blaring from various speakers dotted around the multiple rooms.

“Ooff, sorry!” a giggling she-wolf said to me as she nearly knocked me off my feet as she knocked into me. I would rather be anywhere but here right now. This was far too hectic and far too loud for me. I simply glare at the back of the girl as she moves away from me, not a care in the world.

I followed my Mum and my sister, who was almost skipping as she walked, toward the main lounge area. I can only assume my Mum had mindlinked my Dad to let him know we had arrived, and he said they were there, or else we could spend all day looking around for them! It appeared almost every member of the pack had turned up to celebrate the birthday of Miles fucking Davenport.

The lounge area was laden with people, music truly blasting, and everyone seeming to have a good time. Everyone but me. I caught the eye of my brother, leaning against the wall of the lounge, the furthest away from the door we had just walked into. He nodded in my direction before simply turning away.

‘Could have made an effort, Bailey.’ he mindlinked. ‘It is a birthday, not a funeral, you know?’

I felt my heart sink at his words. Great, the insults were starting already, which meant it would only be a matter of time until Miles started too. The two of them seemed to like working together like that. Finding great enjoyment in harassing me. I was only a year younger than both of them, and had desperately hoped the name-calling and insulting would ease off as they got a little older, but if anything, they seemed to get worse. All because I wasn’t like the girls they were interested in, I was sure of it. I wasn’t like the other girls. Made myself an easy target, my Mum told me, all because I enjoyed studying. Liked reading and learning. Said, I only made it harder for myself. The plan was to make it easier for myself by finding a way out…

“Jordan says your dress looks like you are going to a funeral, Bailey.” Morgan teased, fluffing up my curls again. My long brown hair fell in thick, unruly curls down my back. They drove me mad at times. Especially when my brother and sister decide to mess with them.

“Oh well, I wore a dress, like you asked.” I snapped, moving away from them, feeling angry already, so tempted just to turn around and walk home, only to be pulled back by my Mum.

“We are going to wish Miles a happy birthday. You will stay for a while at least. I do not need to be explaining to your Aunt and Uncle yet again why you have walked out on a social event, Bailey.” Mum warned me, her tone sounding grumpy, I swear she had to have read my thoughts on leaving the party already. I am sure she hated having me as a daughter, likely wishing for one that was more sociable, and one that enjoyed being a part of everything, instead of one that would rather have her head in a book.

“Awww, Happy Birthday, Miles!” I heard my sister squeal from by my side. I swear she spoke at a pitch so high only dogs could hear. Goddess knows why she is so excited. It is only his birthday. He likely doesn’t even care, he never normally does…

As I looked up, his blue eyes were locked on me, I raised my gaze to meet his, and could see his eyes shift to a darker blue… was that his wolf? I see a snarl across his face as he suddenly storms from the room. What the hell was that about?

‘Get out here.’ Miles is suddenly mindlinking me, and I have to say he sounded far from impressed. That, combined with the angry expression on his face, told me something was off. Would he have rather I had not come? Well, he was not the only one…

‘What?’ I questioned, completely confused. Was he annoyed over how I had dressed too? Jeez, it was just a dress. Does it really matter? I would go home if it was.

‘Outside now.’ He demanded once more, sounding even more irritated this time, making me realize I had little choice but to follow his orders, so I snuck away from the ongoing party back to the doors of the packhouse.

Only to find Miles pacing along the bottom of the steps, looking a mixture of confused and angry. So why did he need me here? Someone to take his anger out on? I was not willing to be that, I was sure about that… Just as I was about to walk away, he looked up.

“Fucking took you long enough.” He snapped.

I frowned, unsure what this was all about, but it was making no sense to me as I looked down toward him from where I stood at the top of the packhouse steps. His blue eyes shifted to the dark blue once more, like they had inside, taking me by surprise. His wolf is clearly lingering…

“What is wrong, Miles? Do you want me to get Jordan?” I asked.

“No I do not! I do not want anyone knowing this.” He snarls, a growl slipping from his lips, though whether that was aimed at me or whether his wolf was angry at him, I do not know…

“I don’t think I understand…” I began.

“You soon will.” He sneers, and I simply look to him in confusion. Nothing he says makes sense to me. Until he continues. “Only today did I realize. The thought makes me sick. Why our own moon goddess would play a trick like this on me, I don’t know. I am an Alpha. A fucking Alpha. I deserve a strong mate. A beautiful mate to be proud of. Not some feeble pathetic wallflower.”

My body trembles at his words. No. I had yet to gain my wolf. I did not know this yet. Why… Why him of all people? “I am your fated mate?” I question with a shaky voice. “Are you sure?”

“Are you fucking doubting me?” he yells. “And you won’t be. The moment you have your wolf, I will decide when the time is right to reject you.”

My heart twists and contorts at the thought. Rejection was meant to be the most painful thing possible. Why would he want to reject the mate chosen for him by our own moon goddess? Am I truly so repulsive?

# Chapter 2 Bailey

A Year Later

Yet another birthday party for our beloved upcoming Alpha. Ha. Not my beloved upcoming Alpha. I hated the fucker. Breaking my heart without a second thought. What I had done to deserve that I had never got a proper explanation from him. Other than the frequent insults, of why would he want to be with someone like me? Did I look like Luna material to him? I had no clue. What the hell did Luna material look like in his eyes? Some blond bimbo, no doubt. They were the she-wolves he tended to spend his time with within our pack. The ones who worshiped the ground he walked on. That would do anything he asked of them. Ones that I highly doubted read much more than the work set of them at school.

“Bailey!” my Mum yelled at me from the stairway of our family home. “Will you hurry up?!”

“Do I really need to come to the party?” I responded. “I am telling you, Miles will not be bothered if I am not there!”

“Your Aunt and Uncle will be though. And I am not explaining to them again why you are missing.” My Mum continues yelling. “Do you not realize just how many events you have missed this year, all because you have your head in a book?”

“Yeah Bai-Bai. Such a geek. No wonder you have no friends.” My sister Morgan giggles from outside my bedroom door.

“Piss off.” I hissed. “I have friends.”

I stormed from my room, and down the stairs toward my waiting family. I planned to greet the birthday boy, not that he would care in the slightest. I know that he would rather not see me at all. And then I would sneak home.

“Ew, are you wearing that?” Morgan asked.

I looked down at the skinny black trousers I had on and the white tank top. Great. I can’t win. Nothing I wear is approved of by my sister, evidently named the fashion queen without my knowledge. Oh well, I am dressed and wearing it. I think it looked good with my chunky black sandals I had on…

I scowled at my sister and walked out of the door. “Are we going or not?” I snapped at them all, truly not able to wait for the following month when I leave to go to university. Get away from them, and this pack!

The party was well underway when we arrived, music pounding from the speakers as couples made out in every available space, so I averted my eyes as we walked through the corridors of the packhouse to the lounge where we would no doubt find Miles reigning over his people. Being all important, like he was partial to considering himself.

‘Why are you here?’ Miles’s voice filled my mindlink, before I had even fully entered the room behind my parents.

Great. ‘I didn’t get a choice. Trust me, I would rather not be.’ I snapped back.

I was getting more than a little tired of the way he would treat me. Yes, he planned on rejecting me. Decided I was not for him, but he could have left it at that. I didn’t need treating like I was some sort of social pariah because of the fact he decided I was not right for him. I do not think I deserved that. I had endured enough bullying through my time in high school, for the fact I enjoyed my education.

‘Oh. Excuse me? Are you implying you were not going to come to the party of your next Alpha?’ Miles links with some serious attitude.

‘Miles, you just asked why I had bothered coming. Now you are asking if I was not going to come? Make your mind up.’ I argued.

‘Remember who I am Bailey. You are not above me. Never will be. Could have been equal to me at most had I seen you as suitable to be my mate, but no. You were beneath that honor.’ He sneers.

I felt anger racing through me. ‘And you think I would not have rejected you?’ I snapped, moving back toward the exit, not wanting to be here anymore. Until I felt a hand grabbing the back of my tank top, yanking me back.

My eyes darted upward to see the dark eyes of Miles. Sneering down at me. Our Pack’s upcoming Alpha. The most arrogant man I think I have ever met. One, thankfully, I did not have to be mates with any longer as the stupid fucker had chosen to reject his own fated mate before even giving her a chance. “Going somewhere Bailey?” he asked, his voice full of spite.

“Well, I do believe you asked me why I was here, so I assumed you wanted me to leave.” I told him.

Miles bows his head down so it is level with mine, he inhales deeply, like he still enjoys the scent of me. He has done this numerous times of late, which I find quite bizarre. But, I ignore him as he tilts his head to look at me, “Hmm, I think my Mum and Dad may have something to say if you leave. Their clever little Bailey. Heaven forbid.” He presses his forehead against mine. “Just stay away from me, and do not spoil my fun.”

I shake my head in disbelief at him, as he stalks away. Did he even think for a moment I would be going near him if I could avoid it? I would rather be anywhere but near him!

“Bailey, why are you harassing my friend for?” I heard my brother, Jordan demand, as he suddenly approached, causing many people to turn around and look at me. Wonderful. Nothing like starting pack gossip is there. I am sure Miles would appreciate that!

“I wasn’t harassing him, he came to speak to me. Asking why I had come.” I told him, and my brother laughed. He is as much an idiot as Miles. Any of my friends who have big brothers hate how protective they are. Me? No, my big brother is the one leading all the bullying and being a total dick to me. He finds great embarrassment in the fact his younger sister is far from being one of the popular group, and is, in his words, ‘far too into her books’. I think, in all honesty, my entire family found me, in one way or another, a huge embarrassment.

“Well, he has a point. Not like you will be joining in with the celebrations. You will probably be sitting in a quiet corner somewhere reading.” He teases.

“Well, it is certainly more intellectually pleasing than any of you would be.” I smirked at him as I walked away from my brother who was standing looking confused. I am sure he had no clue what I meant. The scary thing is he will be the next, pack Beta. Heaven help our pack. Between him and Miles they only had one brain cell between them, and that was one that they shared, I am sure of it! And even then, I think it was rechargeable and started losing power and knowledge at a rapid rate! They only graduated high school because they paid people to do their work for them.

As I snuck away, out of the busy lounge to the top of the stairway, where I hoped to hide out for as long as possible, I heard footsteps behind me. I quickly turned, hoping it was simply someone on their way to their bedroom or even to one of the spare bathrooms on this floor. But, sadly, luck was not on my side tonight. No. Miles was following me. Eyebrows raised and looking quite irritated.

“Oi. I want to talk to you.” he demanded.

“You asked me to go away a minute ago, didn’t you?” I asked him.

“Don’t think so, think it was more a case of why you were here.” Miles says with a smirk. Sitting on the top step with me.

“Miles, you have the whole pack here for your birthday, I am sure whatever you need to speak to me about can wait.” I shrugged, desperately craving peace, which, considering the pounding beat of the music playing, would be difficult.

“No. Why didn’t you tell me you were leaving?” he questions, like he is irate at the fact I had not let him know. Why would I let him know?

“Why would I? We aren’t friends, Miles. You also are not my Alpha yet. It was arranged with my parents, me and your Dad, as Alpha.” I explained to him, unsure why this would even bother him. If anything, I would think he would be glad to get rid of me.

“You are going away though.” he murmurs.

“That is generally what happens when you go to college or university. Yeah.” I said with another shrug.

“There wasn’t one closer to home?” he hisses. “Because it seems to me you picked the one furthest away.”

“What does it matter to you? You hate me. I won't be here, You get your wish of being rid of me.” I snapped, truly sick of him trying to dictate to me what I should and shouldn’t be doing. I had worked hard in school, so I could do this. My parents had spoken to my Aunt and Uncle, the Luna and Alpha of our pack to allow me special permission to go to a university out of state to study, saying it was what I had dreamed of. I had nothing holding me back. And, with the fact Miles did not want me for his mate, or his Luna, I truly did not. Not that any of them knew of that. That was our own secret.

Even despite the pull to him as my mate since my wolf had arrived, I still found him truly repulsive. He sickened me. Though, the pains when he slept with the many she-wolves that visited his bed, made it even easier to detest the man that he had become. I still had no clue what I had done to deserve this treatment from this man, other than not being one of the popular group. But, I knew I deserved better than him.

Miles glanced at me, momentarily a thoughtful look passed over his face, almost caring, before a hardness replaced it. “That much is true. No more having to see the disappointing failure the moon goddess made of mating me to you. At least not for a few years. Who knows, perhaps you will meet someone while there. I suggest you do. That way you won’t have to come back, because, I, as Alpha, will be looking for my Luna.”

“Miles, I honestly do not care if you find someone else.” I told him, going to stand and head home, not wishing to spend another moment in the same place as him.

As I went to move away, he grabbed my hand, pulling me to him, so I was once more sitting level with him on the top step of the first floor landing of our packhouse. “Always so righteous aren’t you Bailey? You say you don’t care? We will see. Well, this will be on my terms. I, Miles Davenport, reject you, Bailey West, as my fated mate…” he began, and my head began to whirl as his words sunk in. The realization and excruciating pain of what was happening becoming too much for me…

# Chapter 3 Bailey

Three Years Later

I drove the long road down to pack. I hated this drive. It was like returning to hell for me. Lotus Shadow Pack. My very own version of hell. Though, three years away, studying had been truly amazing. Transforming myself into the woman I should always have been. Confident. Self-assured. Brave. Just me. And now a fully qualified teacher.

As a she-wolf, you spend so many years of your life being told your focus is finding your fated mate. Settling down with them and creating a strong matebond. A love. A family. Well, once I had come to accept that my naïve, teenage dreams would never surface, thanks to the moon goddess pairing me with a mate so incapable of loving anyone other than himself, I decided that my focus would be my career. My education had always been something I took great pride in. I loved to learn, and I had decided that I wanted to pass that gift along. I no longer cared what others thought of me. And, while at university, it felt so wonderful to be surrounded by others who felt the same way. I finally felt like I fit in somewhere.

And, I believe that is what allowed me to become the person I was meant to be. However, now, I had to return to my pack, at their orders. The agreement was, once I had completed my degree, I would return home. Unless, of course, I had found my fated mate. But, I knew within my heart, that was never to happen. For, my fated mate sat at home. Lording it over our pack. Acting like he was the best thing since sliced bread. Sleeping with any she-wolf that came near him, from what I heard, having rejected me.

I pulled up at our guarded pack gates. Harley, one of our pack warriors, currently on guard duty, stepped forward to my car window. “ID” he ordered.

I frowned at him. I do not think I have been asked for ID before when returning home, even in all the times I have visited home, though in all fairness, those visits have been few and far between. My visits were only when they were required of me. I had grown to loathe this place, and coming back had become less of a priority for me over the time I was away...

“Harley, it is me. Bailey.” I explained, trying not to smile at his mistake.

Harley looked at me closer. “Shit. Sorry Bailey, didn’t really recognize you there. You changed your hair. And you aren’t wearing your glasses. You look good.” He says with a shrug, quickly looking away, clearly embarrassed by his faux-pas.

I smirk at his response. Yes, my hair is somewhat tamer than it used to be. The curls straightened out, and my hair now neat and sleek down my back. My glasses I had worn for reading had been long gone. Having got my eyes fixed with laser eye surgery whilst away. Plus, I now wore a little simple make-up to accentuate my features. Nice to know somebody has noticed a difference…

“No problem. You still need ID?” I asked him.

He grins at me. “I think I know who you are. Nice to see you.” he nods at me in acknowledgment as the gate opens for me. “Maybe catch you around while you are back.” He adds as I begin to drive away.

I smiled in response, I guess there would be nothing to stop me catching up with any guy I wanted to now. Not that I was really bothered right now... but it was not like I had a fated mate to wait for any longer. And it wasn’t like Miles was making a point of staying single. Every time I had returned home, he had had a different she-wolf on his arm. Parading them through pack like a prized possession, only to have traded her in by the time I returned on my next visit. He was turning into quite the lothario. And quite a joke in my eyes.

I set off along the quiet, familiar roads of our sweet old pack. The evening sun was settling in the sky as I moved my car down the route to my family home. No doubt my Mum would be there waiting for me, perhaps my Dad, if he was in from work by now. My brother and sister, I was unsure. They still both lived at home with my parents, but were back and forth to friends' homes and my brother was looking to move into the Beta suite in the packhouse soon enough, in preparation for taking on the role from my father when the time came. Either way, they rarely bothered to rush home to see me when they knew I was returning. I don’t think seeing me was at the top of their priority list…

I pulled my car up on the street in front of my familiar family home. I could not believe I was home. Stuck back here. The dread within my stomach churned heavily at the prospect of many years stuck here. Miserable and unhappy, with no way out, now my fated mate had rejected me. Not that anyone other than Miles and I knew of that. No. He had decided he would be considered weak if others knew an Alpha had gone against the powerful Moon Goddess’s choice. So, this was our secret. Or he would make me pay in ways I did not want to imagine, apparently.

And, in all honesty, I did not want to think of it. He had allowed me to go away to do my degree. Doing the final bit of convincing when my Uncle, the current Alpha, and Miles’s father, along with my parents were on the fence. Or, so he said. How true that was, I would never likely know the truth, but it had been for that reason, and that alone I had chosen to do as he had asked.

If he had done the things he said, then he had allowed me to fulfill my dream of gaining my degree of teaching away from pack. To allow me to be just me, not the daughter of the pack Beta. And I have thrived because of it. But, now, I had to return. Back to where I belonged. And, while I may have gained my degree, I had no real future prospects. I was likely stuck here.

I stepped from the car, determined more than ever to find work, as I heard my Mum’s voice. “Bailey!” she greeted me from the porch steps, a big smile upon her face. “You look beautiful sweetheart.”

I smiled back at her, as I moved toward the front door. Only to see Miles leaving the house next door to ours. The Alpha home. Could I have timed my arrival home any worse?

His eyes met mine, giving me a dark stare before looking at my Mum. “Hi Aunt Brianna. You didn’t say she was home today.”

Mum smiled at Miles like she thought the world of him, though most of the time she generally did. “Ah, I think it slipped my mind. Bailey is home for good now, Miles. How wonderful is that?”

Once more, Miles gave me a dark stare. “Hmmm. Truly wonderful.” he said with some serious contempt in his voice.

‘You stay out of my way unless I say otherwise, you understand?’ Miles mindlinks me, as he moves toward his car.

“Are you not going to speak to him Bai?” Mum tries. “He will be Alpha this time next year, you know?”

“Oh it doesn’t matter, Aunt Brianna. Bailey will be excused this time. I am sure she is tired from her drive back home. But no doubt I will be seeing her around. And yes, she will have to get used to me as her senior. Her Alpha.” He says with a sneer, and at his words my stomach twists into knots. I don’t think I can stay here… I not only need to find work, I need to find work away from my pack, so I can move away to get away from my psychotic Alpha and ex-mate!

# Chapter 4 Bailey

I sit out in the garden drinking my morning coffee, with my laptop open scrolling desperately through the job vacancies, when I hear a deep growl to my left, causing me to swirl my head to look. Miles was resting his head on the garden fence from next door, overlooking our back garden, to where I was sitting. Watching me intently, the look upon his face was one of sheer disgust...

I had no clue how long he had been standing there, or what had angered him to the point of growling, but he had made me jump. “Fucking hell, Miles.” I snapped, giving him a dark scowl. I had done well the past week since arriving and stayed out of his way. Managing to ensure I avoided all pack events, and ensuring I dodged any places he was likely to be. Yes, it meant I spent an awful lot of time in my bedroom at home, but I would rather do that than have to deal with him.

Today, the sun was glorious, and I thought it would be nice to take my breakfast outside while I looked for jobs online. Sitting on the patio furniture we have in the back garden, under the warmth of the morning sunshine, my coffee was enjoyable, all until this stupid fucker disturbed me. I shook my head in his direction, wondering why he had snuck up on me. He had so many more places he could be...

“Who do you think you are cursing at?” Miles snarled.

“The creep who did exactly that. Crept up on me out of the blue for no good reason.” I rolled my eyes at him in disgust, only to see this seemed to anger him further. Though, I think anything I did would anger Miles. He seemed to hold some serious resentment towards me at the moment, but should I really expect anything less?

“I will come over there and deal with you, Bailey.” He hissed.

“Deal with me?” I questioned his choice of words. “Deal with me how? You asked me to stay out of your way. That is what I am doing.”

“What are you doing?” he chose to ignore my words, and looks to my laptop screen instead, so I slowly shut the screen down, so he would be unable to see. I do not want him knowing I am applying for work outside the area. I would not put it past him to stop it from happening. He seems to be being deliberately nasty of late, so I truly do not know what he would sink to, in order to be nasty towards me…

“Nothing of your concern.”

“I am your Alpha. So, all that goes on in my pack is my business.” He tells me with a smirk.

I shook my head with a smirk back, “Hmm, not quite Miles, you are not. Your Dad is still Alpha, so don’t be getting ahead of yourself.”

An angry look flared across his face once more. His handsome features contorted in fury. He did not like having people disagree with him. But I was not about to have him dictating to me...

“Just because you were my mate once upon a time does not give you the right to talk to me however you please, you know.” Miles snarls.

“She is your mate?” a voice questions, causing us both to whip our heads round, only to see the unexpected face of Miles’s younger brother Ellis.

I look at Miles with despair now, my heart pounding within my chest and my palms becoming sweaty. Wondering what the hell he planned to do now the secret we had kept between us for so long was out now… how had neither of us heard him coming?

“No she is not. She rejected me.” Miles said coldly, looking at me as if daring me to disagree with him.

Wait... he was making it out like I had rejected him? I looked at Miles in shock, but the look within his eyes was like he dared me to argue.

“You rejected your Alpha? What kind of fool are you?” Ellis asked as his eyes looked me up and down like a piece of dirt. Sadly, a look I am more than used to. “Do Mum and Dad know?”

Miles shakes his head. “No. I don’t want them to either. It would worry them too much, Els, please do not say anything. Bailey and I were never a good match, so perhaps she made the right choice. Please for me?” Miles is pleading with his brother, and part of me wonders if he is worried what his family would do if they learned of his decision to go against the Moon Goddess. As an Alpha, this was almost unheard of. Blaming me was gutless. But, if that is what he wants to do, then let him.

‘Do not even think of saying anything different.’ Miles’s voice reverberates through my mind via the link. ‘Or you will learn to regret it. That degree you love so much could easily be destroyed.’

I took in the words Miles had said, and the sad thing is, I do not doubt them. I would not put it past him finding a way to have my degree removed. Having me stuck within our pack. He would be Alpha soon enough, and he would be the one able to dictate what I did... I had little choice but to do as he asked. Yet i felt anger racing through my veins...

I lifted my laptop and stood from my seat. “I will talk to you however I like Miles. When you seem to think you can treat me however you like.” and with that I walked away from the two brothers, both looking at me, walking away in shock. I know I would come to regret what I had just said, but I truly no longer cared…",1,1749881815.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
