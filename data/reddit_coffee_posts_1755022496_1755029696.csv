Every once in a while, something comes along that doesn’t just tweak how we do things, but totally reinvents it. ChatGpt feels like one of those moments, right? If you’ve spent any time with it, you know that it’s more than just a chatbot—it’s like discovering the whole house is a smart home, not just the light bulb.

Here’s why I’m totally jazzed about what’s happening:

- **Productivity unchained**: Need to brainstorm code, prose, meal plans, or trip itineraries? Done, done, done, and done (in less time than it takes to make coffee).

- **Accessible creativity**: You don’t need to be an author or a programmer to get fantastic results. The experience is welcoming, and it actually seems to *want* you to shine.

Out of nowhere, “talking” to an AI isn’t science fiction—it’s Tuesday. Not only does it help you write your poems and summarize research papers, but it also explains memes, role-plays as your virtual debate buddy, and even scolds you gently about procrastinating. (Just me?)

But it gets better!

There’s something incredibly *fun* about it. One minute you’re working, the next you’re seeing what the AI thinks about pineapple pizza or which historical figure would win in a rap battle. It feels a little like peeking behind the curtain of the digital world and seeing a future that’s both creative and collaborative.

Some big questions pop up, though:

- What cool uses have you found for ChatGpt lately?
- Are you using it for school, work, fun, or just to see what it’ll say next?
- What features or “magic tricks” totally blew your mind?

I’m genuinely excited every time I talk to it. Sure, there are limits—ChatGpt isn’t perfect (and sometimes gives hilariously weird answers)—but isn’t it wild how fast it’s improved in just the last few months? It makes me *happy* (like, actual happy) watching tech become more friendly, creative, and helpful.

It’s like we’ve stumbled across a digital co-pilot for imagination, learning, and, sometimes, just a day-brightening laugh when you need it most.

Tell me: What moment made you go “Whoa!” using ChatGpt? What do you want it to do next? Let’s hear your stories!",1,1755029448.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False
1mojij3,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1mojij3/unrestrained_dogs_in_cars_should_be_ticketed_like/,Unrestrained dogs in cars should be ticketed like unbuckled kids,"If you are driving with a dog loose in your lap, or one who is pacing on the seats, or surfing the window, that should be a ticket. Simple as that. 

I love dogs. It is just reality that a forty pound missile in a sudden stop becomes a danger to the dog and everyone else. People talk about how their dog is calm, then I watch the same scene at a red light where the dog climbs into the driver’s space or blocks the mirror. If a coffee cup rolling on the floor is a distraction, a living animal bouncing around definitely is. We already solved this for kids with car seats and for humans with seatbelts. There are cheap harnesses that clip to a seatbelt and crates that fit the cargo area. If you can afford the gas and the groomer you can afford a twenty dollar restraint. And no, holding the dog with one arm is not a safety system. In a crash you are not catching a flying labrador like a bouquet.

The usual rebuttals are just convenience and feelings. My dog hates the harness. My trip is only five minutes. He needs to stick his head out the window. None of those arguments work for people who refuse seatbelts either. Everyone hates restraints until the one time they are the thing that matters.

If we are going to fine people for texting and buckle laws, it makes zero sense that we shrug at a pet bouncing around the cabin. Write the rule the same way we write seatbelt rules. Harnessed or crated in the back. Driver’s lap is an automatic no. Service animals can have documented exceptions with specific guidelines. That is called being consistent.

1mojhvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Deconstruction/comments/1mojhvg/how_do_i_ask_this_cute_girl_out/,How do I ask this cute girl out?,"I am a 26M Pakistani guy currently in studying in Germany. I came here around 1 year ago. I left my religion around the age of 23 and started my deconstruction journey. I went through hell and unlearned quite a lot of BS related to sexuality. I am at least comfortable now to proclaim that I am a sexual being.

Since I was raised in a conservative hell like hyper gender segregation. Like even fiancé aren't allowed to talk to one another before the wedding night. Men and women are killed if their family come to know that they are chatting with the opposite sex.

When I landed here in Germany, I quickly found out I have huge anxiety around women. I couldn't sit next to them in a bus or train. To get over it, I joined dancing classes. Even though I am still uncomfortable around women, I am doing much better. I now can talk with them and be friends with them without any issues.

The next step is of course getting romantically and sexually involved with them. It took me 1 year to open up to my therapist that I like women and would love to get romantic with them. Since I have no experience whatsoever, I have low self-confidence and self-esteem.

Recently I got to know cute girl 24F from US who is also here in my town. She came here 8 months ago. She is from Illinois and was homeschooled until high school. Later she went to a christian college. She is also deconstructing from her religion and we have talked about quite a lot of stuff when it comes to this. I have only met this girl 3 times through tennis.

The first time we didn't talk that much and just played tennis. The second time when I got tired, she sat beside me and we started talking. That's how I got to know about her story and how she is deconstructing as well. Later that evening when we were parting, I asked her out.

I said ""would you love to go for a coffee or drink sometimes"".  
She was caught offguard and was like ""what do you me... when... when?""  
Since it was so awkward, I deflected and said ""anytime, if you are interested, you let me know""  
She was like ""hmm... yeah... I will let you know""

Since the conversation was so awkward, I shifted the convo to something else and made sure we leave on a positive note which we did. This is my second time asking someone and I don't know how dating works.

The third time we met for tennis, I started goofing around and we got pretty well together. During the break, she came over and started talking with me. She was pretty enthusiastic and engaged in the conversation, standing close to me etc. We talked about my wisdom teeth surgery, my anxiety around women, sexuality, sex ed, purity culture, dating and what not. Note that she never dated as well in her high school and college.

Later when we were parting again that day, she lingered for even longer and we talked for so long about her plan here in Germany and what she is doing. When we were about to leave, I hugged her lightly and left. She smiled and left.

Now we probably will meet this Friday again for tennis. How do I ask her to be my GF? Here in Germany, you hangout and then slowly hold hands, and then kiss, and then have sex and then you are together. There is no ""what are we"" talk. Since she is from the US, I think I have to explicitly ask her to be my GF or show my desire, how do I do that?

I wanna pull the trigger, get physically comfortable with her because I don't know how long she will be in my town. She is such a cutie that I have been thinking about her all this time. I don't wanna lose here. Should I just verbatim say that ""I like you and would love to take you out"" or ""I like you and would love to spent time with you/to be your BF""?",0,1755029381.0,Deconstruction,0,0.5,False
1mojhls,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blacksmith/comments/1mojhls/damascus_question/,Damascus question,"Hey all. Quick question for the group.

I've tried the usual ways to etch my Damascus (ferric chloride by itself, ferric chloride + coffee etch, etc.) Recently, I tried ferric chloride, followed by gun bluing, finishing with a light hand sand to get the pattern to pop, and it looks pretty good. 

But I noticed that I've not heard of others doing the same, and I'm concerned that there's a reason for it - some sort of drawback in either how it affects the steel or the long term appearance that I'm missing. Does anyone else do a similar treatment? Why or why not? Any advice would be appreciated ",1,1755029363.0,Blacksmith,0,1.0,False
1mojhem,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1mojhem/quick_observations_and_advice_from_a_renently/,Quick observations and advice from a renently returned 1st time trip,"My wife and I traveled with two teenagers (19&16) for two weeks: Tokyo—> Nagano area—>Takayama—>Kyoto. Got some good advice on this sub so I’m just giving back a little.

1. We rented a car for a few days near Nagano and Takayama and stayed in a fairly remote inn. Totally worth it. Car rental is easy and recommended.

2. The heat in Aug thing is overhyped. It’s hot for sure but so are most places this time of year. It amounted to a minor nuisance.

3. If you see something you’d like to buy, buy it right then. You might not see another again or you might not have time to look later. I bought a knife at the first store I saw and I’m glad I did. We never had much time to go knife shopping again.

4. If you play an instrument, jam sessions are a good way to meet, and hang out with, some Japanese people. You can find them in Tokyo pretty easily but I also jammed with a coffee shop owner in Takayama. Fair warning: the people I played with were GOOD. They were all very nice though.

5. We booked all our train tickets at the tourist information booth at Haneda right upon arrival. They spoke good English and were very helpful. Recommended.


6. Finally, I set up the macro itinerary, booked the hotels etc. but I let the kids decide our daily itineraries. I also let them lead the way in navigating the subways and I just followed them. Put those kids to work!",0,1755029350.0,JapanTravelTips,0,0.33,False
1mojgh5,https://i.redd.it/j3ppx5u2bnif1.png,How I’ve been making an extra $20–$40/week just on my phone,"As a student, I’m always looking for small, low-effort ways to make a bit of extra cash without it eating into my study time. Most things I’ve tried either take too long or pay almost nothing.

Recently I’ve been using AttaPoll, a survey app where you answer short questionnaires and share opinions. Surveys range from 1 to 40 minutes, the cashout minimum is low, and I’ve actually been getting payouts to PayPal the same day. Honestly, it’s one of the few apps where I’ve seen real results almost instantly, which is super motivating.

I usually just do them on the bus, between lectures, or while waiting for coffee, and it adds up to $20–$40 a week.

Tip: Fill out your profile fully and turn on notifications, it makes a big difference.

If you want to try, you can use my code DFPOS in the app. It gives you 10% extra pay on every survey and helps me out too. Totally optional 🙂",1,1755029293.0,Referrallinks,2,1.0,False
1mojg0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mojg0t/watch_me_win_alpha_my_alpha_mate_ethan_hawthorne/,"Watch Me Win, Alpha | My Alpha mate, Ethan Hawthorne, brought his mistress into our pack.","Chapter 1 Olivia’s POVMay 8, 2023, my Alpha Mate, Ethan Hawthorne brought his mistress to our pack, and I decided to deceive him into divoring me.Standing in front of his office, I took a deep breath, knocked on and stepped inside.The polished wood door swung closed behind me with a soft click.I clutched the file in my hands , forcing a mechanical smile to my lips as I approached his desk. Ethan didn’t glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.“Are you busy?” I asked, my voice even, polite.He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.“A bit,” he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.“Just a few spots to sign.”Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.I watched silently. Ethan looked…worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference — a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.But he hadn’t come back alone.My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‘He reeks of her.’I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.“Thanks,” I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.I paused, hesitated, then asked, “Will you be home for dinner tonight?”Predictably, Ethan shook his head. “Got some things to wrap up here. Don’t wait.”I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. “Got it. See you around, Alpha,” I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule—not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.”I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.‘Smell.’Sweet vanilla perfume — too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‘He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.’My throat tightened painfully.My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer—the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.Firm. Bold. Unwavering.Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.That familiar scent I sniffed earlier—I knew exactly who it belonged to. I’m smarter than this. I should’ve seen it coming.I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan’s mother Amelia’s voice again— calm, cold, and cutting. “Don’t be naive, Olivia. Men—even Alphas—always want more. They don’t stay faithful.”A bitter laugh escaped my lips. “You were always spot on, Amelia,” I muttered.I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.‘We deserve better’, Yve whispered.‘We do’, I agreed.Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.I hit send without hesitation.The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack’s standing — something Amelia would never allow.Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.I had my dignity.After a month — the grace period to finalize everything — Ethan would be free.And so would I.I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That’s when a knock came at the door.“Come in,” I said.Ethan’s beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.“Luna Olivia,” he said formally, not quite meeting my eyes. “Alpha Ethan asked me to deliver this to you. He bought it for you during his trip to London.”Reed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set — necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo...on her.Disgust crawled up my throat.“Alpha Ethan mentioned he... he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you.” Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.“How thoughtful of him,” I said. “Even with his busy schedule and all” I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.Reed flinched slightly. “I should get back,” He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a soft thud.My eyes dropped back to the jewelry sitting on my desk, gleaming under the harsh office lights.My stomach twisted in disgust.Without wasting another second, I snapped a photo of it and forwarded it to a second-hand luxury dealer.Me: Donate the full amount to the werewolf orphanage fund.I shut the box with a click, wiping my hands like I’d just handled garbage. Because, honestly, that’s what it felt like.By five in the evening, I was wrapping up, gathering my things, and heading to the parking lot.The day had drained me, but it was the kind of exhaustion that sat deeper than muscles or bones.As I stepped outside, the wind shifted, carrying a familiar scent.Leather. Musk. Vanilla.My eyes narrowed instinctively.That’s when I spotted Ethan’s car, parked near the exit.Through the window, I caught a glimpse—Ethan, sitting in the back seat.And right beside him, a vibrant blonde, laughing like she didn’t have a care in the world.Reed was behind the wheel.The second he saw me, he slammed on the brakes, hard enough that the car jolted.For a heartbeat, everything went still.My eyes locked with Ethan’s through the glass.Chapter 2Olivia’s POVI recognized the blonde girl sitting close to Ethan — it was Chole Windsor, the daughter of the Alpha of the second-largest pack in the United States.She didn’t even pretend to be subtle. Her eyes found mine across the lot, but she made no move to step away from Ethan. Instead, she draped her arms over his shoulders, leaned in, and whispered something in his ear. He didn’t stop her.I looked away. Got into my car, turned the engine, and drove off without sparing them a second glance.I hadn’t been home for long. After slipping off my shoes at the entrance, I made my way upstairs to the walk-in closet, the quiet of the pack house settling around me.I was standing in front of the wardrobe, picking out a necklace — something simple to go with tomorrow’s blazer — when I heard a car pull into the gravel driveway outside.I didn’t need to look to know who it was.A moment later, I smelled someone behind me.Ethan.I didn’t turn around. Just clasped the necklace and set it back in its place.“Are you upset?” he asked.“Obviously,” I said, still not looking at him. “You should be careful next time.”He didn’t respond right away. I heard him exhale through his nose. “The Windsor pack’s Alpha wants to collaborate with us. I’ve been talking to Felix, their eldest Alpha-in-line. Chole is his sister.”I nodded slightly and turned to face him. “So to secure the alliance, it’s necessary to wrap your arms around his sister in public?”His jaw flexed. He didn’t answer immediately. For a moment, he just looked at me like he didn’t expect to be questioned. Then his voice hardened.“I'm trying to explain, Olivia. Watch your tone when speaking to your Alpha.”I stared at him for a second.“You don’t need to explain anything to me,” I said. “If you’re tired of me and ready to name someone else as Luna, say so. I’ll leave.”His face darkened. “What did you just say?”I didn’t flinch. “I said we can get a divorce and break the bond.”I stepped past him, but he grabbed my arm. His hand shot up to my chin, gripping it just enough to hold me still without bruising.“Don’t ever say that again,” he said, voice low.I didn’t respond. Just met his eyes for a beat too long before pulling away.But inside, I already knew — I wasn’t saying it for effect.I’d been thinking about divorce for weeks. Preparing for it in quiet ways. I didn’t want him anymore.Ethan stayed home that night. Sat in the Alpha’s private office most of the evening, didn’t eat dinner. It was well past midnight when he finally got a phone call that made him leave. I wasn’t close enough to hear everything, but I caught a woman’s voice on the other end — crying.The next morning, my phone lit up with a message from my friend Ava — a lawyer. She had sent me a screenshot of Chole’s latest post.It was a photo taken at sunrise, from the top of some mountain trail. Two hands clasped together, fingers interlocked.The caption read: “Enjoy the sunrise, feel your heartbeat.”I stared at the photo.One of those hands was Ethan’s. I’d know that scar near his thumb anywhere.I sat holding my mug for so long the water went cold. Only when I set it down did it make a sound.The following days, Ethan didn’t return home.At work, we saw each other only during meetings. He sat at the head of the table, and I stayed on the side with the executives. We barely made eye contact. I didn’t go upstairs to his office, and he didn’t come down to mine.In the evenings, I started browsing house listings — somewhere small, outside the city. I also started clearing out the closet. Anniversary gifts. Jewelry. Even the wedding ring. All of it went to resell platforms or donation. They didn’t mean anything to me anymore.One evening around 11 p.m., Luna Kate from SilverFang pack texted me out of the blue, inviting me to join her at a club. We were not very familiar—I'd only met her a few times when I attended the Pack Summit with Ethan. She was very good at greeting anyone with her fake smile. Her Alpha husband was frequently caught up in scandals, and now she started to be a social butterfly as well.I almost said no. But then I remembered — if I really left the Hawthorne Group, I’d have to build something on my own. Might as well start moving.“Sure,” I texted back.When I got to the Moonfell, Kate met me near the entrance. She linked her arm through mine like we were best friends.“Glad to see you Olivia,” she kissed my face. No one but our inner circle knew Ethan and I were married. They always called me Olivia and thought we were just a rumored couple with mate bond.“Me too,” I tried to fake smile.She led me upstairs and into a large room that was divided by a decorative wooden screen.There were people on the other side — laughing, drinking, talking loud — but Kate brought me to this side, quieter, with just one woman sitting alone. I recognized her vaguely. Mate of someone in Ethan’s circle. She smiled at me — tight, awkward.I took off my coat, sat down, and Kate disappeared a moment later.I picked up a drink, sipped it once, and then I heard it.My name.From the other side of the screen.“She hasn’t been seen with Alpha Ethan much lately, huh?”“Well, of course not. He takes Chole Windsor everywhere now.”“She’s the daughter of the second biggest Pack Alpha in the country. Obviously, she’s a better fit. Makes the Pack look stronger.”“Still, Olivia and Alpha Ethan were together what — eight years? He’s probably tired of her even though they are mates.”There was a pause. Then a chuckle.“Shame. She wasted her best years. I’d still take a go at her, though.”The cup froze in my hand.I recognized the voices. Two of them belonged to the sons of the Gamma and Delta.The woman beside me shifted uncomfortably.I stood up. She looked startled, maybe thinking I was going to leave.Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and stepped around the screen.The laughter faded when they saw me.I leaned casually against the edge of the divider, my drink in hand. I looked at the one who’d spoken last.“Isn’t it a bit unfair?” I asked. “You make it sound like I’ve been living off him.”They blinked.I took a sip.“Ethan was a virgin before we got together. So if I’ve been using him to satisfy my needs for eight years without paying — sounds like I got the better deal, doesn’t it?Silence. The whole room had gone still.Most of them just stared— and then widened when they looked at someone behind me.Chapter 3Olivia’s POVI smelled it. I turned around, and there he was.Alpha Ethan.I glanced at him, then looked past him to the low velvet sofa behind. Chole Windsor sat there, legs crossed, glass in hand.Her smile was gone. The way she stared at me —her eyes flashing with the territorial aggression of a she-wolf ready to defend her claim — made it clear she would've ripped my throat out if she could get away with it.That’s when it clicked.This wasn’t some coincidence. They were here together. Chole, Ethan, and their usual circle — people I once thought of as allies. This was their private little gathering. From the way they talked earlier, it clearly wasn’t their first. They didn’t even care to hide their relationship. Maybe they never had.Ethan walked toward me.Behind him, the group scrambled back to life. One of them stepped forward quickly. “Olivia, we were just messing around—none of it was serious. We were just talking nonsense.”Another added, “Really sorry. We didn’t mean anything by it.”I didn’t respond.Ethan reached for my wrist.“Let’s go,” he said, already trying to pull me out of the room.I didn’t fight.Instead, I grabbed my drink and threw it in his face, a clear challenge in the presence of his pack.The room fell into complete silence again. Someone gasped. I could hear the ice clink against his cheek as the liquid ran down his jawline.I smiled faintly, “Please, Alpha, continue enjoying yourself with your beloved. I won’t interrupt again.”Then I lowered my head, tried to pull my hand back from his.His grip only tightened.His face had gone dark. Without another word, he bent down, grabbed me, and threw me over his shoulder like a sack.I kicked instinctively. “Ethan—put me down!”He didn’t respond.We walked into the hallway, and I struggled on his back, but Ethan didn’t loosen his grip.The elevator had just arrived on the floor. As he stepped inside and turned around, my upside-down view caught a pair of polished black leather shoes. Then black suit pants, long legs, and pale hands — each finger slender, the joints sharp and defined.The air felt still. Quiet but awkward.Ethan walked out of the elevator just as I looked up — and met a pair of deep, steady eyes.Sharp and captivating.They held mine for a second too long. I looked away, suddenly embarrassed to be seen like that. Slung over Ethan’s shoulder like some helpless object.Suddenly, Yve stirred inside me, her instincts sharpening, the primal awareness of another strong wolf nearby sparking her curiosity.I didn’t know why I felt that way. But I didn’t like it. It unsettled me.Ethan dragged me out of the club and down the steps to his car. He opened the back door, tossed me in, and climbed in himself.My head spun. Being carried upside down and then thrown like that.He grabbed a wet wipe from the glove compartment and began wiping his face silently.Then he finally spoke. “Why were you there? You came to catch me, didn’t you?”As he wiped his cheek, I noticed something just behind the tissue box.A foil wrapper — gold, neatly tucked behind the tissue box.A condom.The sight of it made my stomach turn. I looked away immediately and reached for the door handle.“I’m not staying in this car,” I said.He pulled me back roughly. “Where do you think you’re going?”“Home,” I said, my breathing uneven. “I want to go home.”“Stop making trouble, Olivia. My patience is running out.”I didn’t answer. Just sat there, breathing hard.“Harold!” Ethan called out toward the club. “Drive.”Harold came out a minute later, nodded, and got into the front seat.The ride was silent. I stayed pressed against the farthest side of the car, arms crossed, staring out the window.By the time we reached the house, I opened the door and got out before the engine had fully stopped.Inside, I went straight to the kitchen and poured a full glass of ice water. I drank all of it in one go.Only then did I feel something close to normal.When I walked back out, Ethan was sitting in the living room. I didn’t ask why.I sat down across from him.It was quiet for a while. Then he said, “I was there to talk business. A new project.”I said nothing.“You showing up and making a scene like that — it embarrassed me.”He kept going. “You looked ridiculous. Screaming, throwing drinks. Like a jealous shrew.”I stared at him.He looked back at me, like he expected me to deny it.“Is that all?” I asked.His brows drew together. “If you want our relationship to work, you need to stop being paranoid all the time. I don’t have time for your insane suspicions.”I nodded. “Got it. Anything else?”He stared at me. “Do you know how annoying you are right now?”I stood up slowly.He won’t be annoyed much longer.I went upstairs, changed into pajamas, and got into bed without another word.He came up about an hour later and found me already asleep.After showering, he got into bed quietly. I turned my back to him and inched closer to the edge, making sure our bodies wouldn’t touch.That didn’t stop him.He hugged me from behind and yanked me back into his arms, rough and without a word. He was tall, his Alpha strength undeniable, the raw power of a pack leader. With barely any effort, he held me in place, his grip unyielding, making it clear that resisting would be pointless.I spent the night stiffly, barely moving.By morning, I hadn’t slept at all. I went downstairs and made breakfast for myself — toast, boiled eggs, a glass of milk. I sat alone at the dining table and started eating in silence.Ethan came down a little while later, dressed for work. He glanced toward me but didn’t say anything at first. He walked halfway to the door, then stopped. A few seconds passed before he turned around and walked over.He leaned in close to my ear.“This weekend,” he said gently, “let’s go out to sea. Just the two of us. Clear our heads a little.”I took a sip of milk and replied without looking at him. “Hmm.”That was it.On Friday, he broke the promise.Said he had to fly to Washington for a project. An urgent meeting, supposedly.I wasn’t surprised. I didn’t feel anything — no disappointment, no anger. Just nothing.Maybe he hasn’t noticed we haven’t shared a meal in weeks. We don’t talk. We don’t go anywhere. We don’t spend time like people in a marriage — not even like people who live under the same roof.He says divorce is out of the question, but I already feel like someone who doesn’t exist to him.If I disappeared tomorrow, I genuinely doubt he would even notice.Over the weekend, I started moving books out of the study. Stacked them into a suitcase and took them to my new apartment. The place was smaller. Simpler. But it felt like mine.While I was organizing the shelf, my phone rang.Melina.I hesitated, then picked up. “Hello, Luna Melina.” Ever since I married his son eight years ago, she still asks me to call her luna.She snorted arrogantly. “Come over now. We need to put down in writing what we discussed earlier.”I paused. “Is that really necessary?”She didn’t hesitate. “If I say so.”""Fine. I'll go back this afternoon,"" I answered.Yet, she wasn't satisfied. ""Come back at noon.""Chapter 4Olivia’s POVI arrived atHawthorne Manoraround 11 AM.As I approached the main entrance, a sweet, overly cheerful voice drifted out through the partially open windows.“Yay! I won again!” The girl’s tone was playful, but there was a flirtatious edge to it, the kind meant to tease a lover. “Are you letting me win on purpose, Ethan?”I paused, my hand hovering over the door handle. I didn’t need to see her to know who it was.Chole Windsor.I realized the real purpose of Melina, she wanted to humiliated me.I took a slow breath, letting Yve’s quiet growl settle in my chest, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.Ethan was in the living room, his head turning sharply when he caught sight of me. For a moment, his eyes flickered with surprise, quickly masked by a flash of annoyance. “What are you doing here?”I walked in, slipping my sunglasses off and tucking them into the pocket of my loose white T-shirt. I hadn’t bothered with makeup today, just jeans and a comfortable shirt. I met his eyes,“Your mom didn’t tel you? She called me.” I continued, “Didn’t know you were back from London so soon. Or are you a magician now, managing to be in two places at once?”His jaw tightened, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. He didn’t respond.Before he could recover, Chole stood up from the plush velvet sofa. She brushed an invisible speck of dust off her thigh, showing off her perfectly manicured fingers.“Hi,” she extened her hand, stepping closer with a bright smile. “I’m Chole Windsor. It’s nice to meet you.”I looked at her outstretched hand for a second, then deliberately ignored her.Melina entered the room. She wore a tailored black dress, her hair swept back in a flawless chignon, a perfect image of power and control. Her eyes moved over me briefly before settling on Chole.“Chole, darling,” she said, taking Chole’s hand in both of hers,“I hope you’re having a good time today. Make yourself at home. This is your house too.”I felt a muscle in my jaw tighten, but I kept my face neutral.Melina’s eyes flicked to me, her expression cooling instantly.“Ah, Olivia. You’re here.”She turned back to Chole, her tone still warm.“This is Ms. Hawthorne, the manager of the Hawthorne Group. She’s here on business.”It took every ounce of self-control not to roll my eyes. She made it sound like I was just another employee, someone here to deliver a report, not the Luna of the pack or her son’s wife. It was a subtle dismissal, a deliberate way to tell Chole that I was no threat.I ignored her, my eyes drifting back to Ethan. He didn’t even try to defend my position.“Didn’t you say we had business to discuss? Let’s get it over with.”Melina’s smile tightened slightly.“We can discuss it another day. You’re here now, so why not join us for a meal?”I exhaled slowly, already tired of this charade.“I’m not here for a meal, Melina. I have other things to do.”I turned to leave, my back already to them.Her voice sharpened,“I am still the pack luna, Olivia, and I have asked you politely to stay. What is this attitude of yours? No manners at all.”I paused, my hand stilling on the back of a leather chair. I turned slowly, meeting her icy stare with one of my own.“Fine. I’ll stay for a meal.”I met her gaze without blinking.“Just make sure you don’t regret it.”Chole, sensing the tension, quickly tried to lighten the atmosphere,“Oh, that’s perfect. I was just telling Ethan how much I enjoyed winning our little game of Silver Moon Toss earlier. I’d love to keep playing.”I glanced at the balcony where a polishedSilver Moon Tosstarget stood, several delicate gold rings stacked neatly beside it. I hadn’t even noticed it before. Clearly, it was something new — probably Chole’s idea.Silver Moon Tosswas a light social competition often played atwerewolf gatherings. The rules were simple — players took turns tossing three golden rings, trying to encircle the movingMoon Pillarfive meters away. It required precision and rhythm, often used to showcase coordination between couples.Chole’s eyes lit up when she saw me looking at the ring toss setup.“Oh, Olivia, do you know how to playSilver Moon Toss?”I met her gaze, catching the hint of challenge behind her bright smile.“Only a little,”I replied, letting my eyes linger on her for a beat.“Wanna play?”Ethan’s jaw tightening as he shot me a warning look.“Of course. Shall I go first, or would you like the honor?” Chole adjusted one of the gold rings on the table, her confidence flaring.“Go ahead. I’ll watch.” I stepped back, casually folding my arms.Chole’s smile widened, clearly pleased with herself. She stepped into position, her posture perfect, each movement precise. She took a steadying breath, then flicked her wrist. The golden ring sliced through the air, narrowly missing the Moon Pillar, landing just a few centimeters off.She turned back to me,“Almost nailed it.”Behind her, Melina’s eyes followed the ring,“Chole. So graceful.”Chole gave a appreciative nod, clearly loving the praise.I didn’t bother with any of the theatrics. I stepped forward, picked up a ring, and tossed it without much thought. The ring cut through the air cleanly, glinting in the sunlight before slipping perfectly around the Moon Pillar with a clear, satisfying clink.Chole’s smile froze for a second, her fingers tightening around the ring she still held. She forced a thin, strained smile.“Lucky shot.”I let a careless smile spread across my lips, leaning back slightly.“Maybe.”I shrugged,“Last time I played this was at the Alpha Foundation dinner with Ethan.”The remark hit its mark. Chole’s face tensed, her grip on the ring tightening as she prepared for the next throw.Melina stepped in quickly,“Dear, it’s just a game. The important thing is to have fun.”I shrugged, stepping back.“Of course. But some people get carried away too easily.”I didn’t miss the way Melina’s eyes flicked to Ethan, a silent accusation in them.In the next few rounds, I almost hit every ring, each one sliding smoothly around theMoon Pillarwith a clear, satisfying clink. Meanwhile, Chole’s throws grew increasingly off-target, her rings clattering against the base or falling short entirely.I noticed the slight tremble in her fingers as she reached for another ring, her forced smile tightening with every miss, her eyes flashing with barely concealed frustration.Melina’s expression grew more strained with each missed attempt, her jaw clenching tighter every time I hit my mark. She glanced at Ethan, as if hoping for some intervention, but he remained silent.I stepped back, dusted my hands lightly, then walked to the nearby sofa. I set my final ring down on the polished side table, folding my hands neatly in my lap, my eyes meeting theirs without flinching.“Want to keep playing?”I asked, my tone light, almost bored.Chole’s hand curled tightly around the last ring, her knuckles turning pale, lips pressed into a thin, strained line.Melina shot me a sharp, furious look, her eyes narrowing into thin, dangerous slits.Chapter 5Olivia’s POV“Come on, one more,”Chole said, trying to hide the frustration in her eyes.“I’m just getting warmed up.",1,1755029265.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1 Framed by His Thoughts


""You brat! Quinn is your brother. How could you hurt him?""

""I'll beat the hell out of you, you heartless bastard!""

...

Ryn Vale's ears were filled with curses when he opened his eyes.

He was on his knees while his back was burning with pain.

His father, Eldric Vale, was red with fury while holding a cane. The sight sent Ryn's mind spinning.

Haven't I already died in that car crash?

How did I end up dreaming about being 17 again?

""Wait ... This isn't a dream.""

The pain jolted his senses awake, and everything became terrifyingly clear.

His gaze swept across his father, mother, and sisters before finally landing on a scrawny teenage boy.

The second Ryn saw him, hatred blazed in his eyes.

He had been reborn!

In his previous life, Steven Lindsay, the driver, had died saving Eldric in a car accident.

Wracked with guilt, Eldric decided to adopt Steven's only son.

That scrawny boy, Quinn Lindsay, became Quinn Vale, the youngest son of the wealthiest family in Riverville.

And from that moment on, Ryn's life spiraled into endless misfortune.

Quinn framed and sabotaged him repeatedly.

Ryn's relationship with his family crumbled, and he was shunned and bullied at school.

His guaranteed admission slot was stolen, he was falsely accused of cheating during examinations, and he was rugged during the SAT. Trouble after trouble fell on him like an unending curse.

Every time he tried to explain, his family and friends didn't believe him.

Eventually, Ryn died miserably, but his spirit lingered in the world long enough to uncover the truth.

It turned out that Quinn was a transmigrator with special abilities. He could transmit his inner voice into other people's minds. Using this rare and hidden ability, he crafted an image of himself as a pure and gentle angel.

He just had to whisper malicious thoughts inside his heart and everyone would hate Ryn.

Then, Quinn stole Ryn's luck and everything he ever had, ultimately leading to Ryn's death in a tragic car crash.

Coming back to now, this was three months after Quinn first arrived at Vale Residence.

Quinn was fully aware of his peanut allergy and had intentionally eaten peanut butter to frame Ryn.

In a rage, Eldric had punished Ryn.

In his previous life, Ryn had desperately tried to explain, but no one had believed him.

The more he spoke, the harsher the beating became.

He ended up in the hospital for three months. The scars on his back never healed.

This time, Ryn wasn't a naive fool. As Eldric raised the cane again, Ryn suddenly grabbed his wrist in mid-air, stopping the strike with surprising ease.

""How dare you fight back?!"" Eldric roared.

""Why wouldn't I?"" Ryn stood up coldly. Though only 17, his tall frame and piercing gaze startled Eldric enough to take a step back. Experiencing two lifetimes had made Ryn bold.

""I didn't say you could get up! Kneel!"" Eldric bellowed.

Ryn's mother, Layla Frost, scowled with disgust. ""When did we raise you to be disrespectful to your parents and cruel to your brother? Where's your manners?""

His sisters chimed in from the side, ""Quinn's already suffered so much, yet you keep bullying him. Mom and Dad are disciplining you for your own good. Get down and take your punishment!""

Ryn swept a frigid glance across the room.

There was no trace of warmth left in his eyes. His gaze was so cold and foreign that it made the whole family's skin crawl.

Ryn was Eldric's seventh kid. Layla gave birth to six daughters before finally resorting to surrogacy abroad to have him.

Ryn's grandfather, Kingston Vale, had adored him more than anyone.

He had raised Ryn himself and taught him with devotion.

Because of that, Ryn had spent little time with his parents or sisters. Their relationship was not the best.

Ever since Kingston's death three years ago, Ryn had become invisible in this household.

Now that Quinn was here, things had only gotten worse.

It was so bad that the maids dared to give him dirty looks.

In this life, Ryn no longer cared about receiving family affection.

He would settle every grudge with his own hands.

""You're the mighty chairman of Vale Group, managing thousands of employees, yet you can't even tell right from wrong. What a fool!"" Ryn scoffed, each word laced with venom. ""No wonder Grandpa always said you were hopeless. That's why he poured everything into raising me as his heir. He saw you for what you are—blind and brainless. You're pathetic!""

""What did you say?""

Eldric's voice trembled with rage.

The rest of the family was stunned.

No one could believe what they were hearing. Not only had Ryn dared to fight back, but he was also mocking Eldric.

""Am I wrong?"" Ryn tilted his head, sneering. ""You believe whatever people tell you. You don't even bother to check the facts before giving your son a beating. If someone said shit tasted good, would you go try it out?""

Smack!

Layla stormed over and slapped him across the face.

""You little shit! Who taught you to talk like that?"" she shrieked, her voice trembling with fury. ""Ungrateful brat!""

""Did you guys raise me?"" Ryn touched his sore cheek, sneering. ""Let's not forget—I was raised by Grandpa.""

Layla's face contorted with shame, and she raised her hand again.

""What? Do you want to hit me again?"" Ryn asked coldly. ""You've hated me from the start because I was born through surrogacy, right?""

He pointed at each sister in turn, ""And all of you trash! You're just jealous that Grandpa gave me 30% of the company. You hated that I had his favor. I did everything I could just to be accepted and you all acted so superior like you were royalty! What a joke!""

Having died once, he saw through it all now.

He would tear away every shred of false decency in the family.

Family? Screw it. Let it all burn.

""I'll let the caning and that slap slide in consideration for our so-called family bond,"" Ryn said coldly while glancing at each of their shocked faces. ""But if it happens again, I swear I'll return every blow. Try me.

""A year from now, when I turn 18, I'll cut ties with all of you. Until then, let's keep the peace. If you can't—well, I won't hesitate to throw you all out. Grandpa gave me this villa. Understood?""

Everyone was at a loss for words for a moment.

""Oh my god!"" Quinn's inner voice echoed in everyone's minds. ""I once heard that Ryn is supposed to be the real heir of the Vales. If Kingston were to die an early death, all of us would have to grovel at Ryn's feet. Turns out it's true!""

Their expressions twisted into horror.

Eldric could feel his authority slipping through his fingers. In a blind rage, he raised his cane again. ""You little shit! You think you're in charge now? I'll beat that arrogance out of you! It's time you learn who's the boss here!""

Crack!

The cane came down like thunder, and an agonizing pain exploded through Ryn's head.

Blood trickled slowly down his forehead in no time.


Chapter 2 An Eye for an Eye


There was lots of blood.

The cane had split open Ryn's scalp, and in an instant, crimson blood poured down his face.

The sight startled Eldric, even causing the others in the room to gasp in horror.

No one had expected him to strike so viciously in a fit of rage.

""So, I guess none of you took my words seriously at all, huh?""

Ryn grinned as his eyes glinted with a touch of madness.

""What are you trying to do?"" Eldric shouted even though he felt guilty. ""If you hadn't disrespected your elders, would I have hit you like this? You brought this upon yourself!""

""You little shit!"" Layla cursed beside him. ""We're teaching you how to behave and this is your attitude?""

""Ryn, stop talking back! Apologize to Dad!""

""If you don't quit your nonsense, don't blame us for throwing you out!""

The sisters all chimed in.

However, Ryn only laughed maniacally.

He hadn't planned on settling the debts of his past life so soon. After all, the rest of the Vales were also victims. Though they had helped push him toward his death, in the end, Quinn had discarded every one of them after using them.

Ryn had wanted to stay quiet and build power in the shadows in this lifetime, but Eldric's cane had shattered the last thread of his patience.

The fury, the humiliation, and the murderous intent built up over two lifetimes erupted like a volcano.

With a flash of movement, Ryn yanked Eldric's hair, dragged him to his knees with brute force, and snatched the cane with his other hand.

""What are you doing?""

""Ryn, are you insane?""

""Stop! That's your father!""

The room exploded with horrified cries.

However, Ryn ignored them all. Without a pause, he raised the cane and sent it crashing down again and again.

""Ahh!

""Ouch!

""Ahh!

""Stop! Ryn, stop!

""I'm your father! Stop hitting me!""

Eldric's screams filled the room. His hands, face, scalp, and even ears were all slashed and bloodied. The cane tore through flesh, causing unbearable pain. His wailing was so loud that it brought the housemaids, housekeepers, and bodyguards running from all corners of the estate.

Everyone was stunned when they arrived.

They had all seen Eldric beat Ryn before.

But never had they seen a son beat his father in full view of everyone.

""Stop! Somebody, stop him!"" Layla shrieked while stomping. ""Are you all dead? Grab that little shit! Hold him down!""

""Yeah! Save Dad!""

""Ryn, how dare you? No one can save you today!""

""You crazy bastard! You'll be punished by the heavens for hitting your dad! The Vales will never tolerate garbage like you!""

The sisters were boiling with rage.

Just as the bodyguards were about to move in, Ryn had already tossed Eldric aside like a piece of trash, leaving him on the ground. Eldric was groaning, his face covered in blood.

Ryn's cold gaze swept across the room, and the bodyguards were so terrified they didn't dare take a step forward.

""Get him to a hospital!"" Layla shouted anxiously.

""No!"" Eldric raised a trembling hand to stop her. His face was twisted with pain and fury as he gritted out, ""Call the family doctor.""

Layla hesitated but then understood his meaning.

If news got out that Ryn had beaten his own father, Vale Group's stock would crash overnight. Their whole family would become a joke among the elite. How would Eldric dare go to a hospital?

Then came Quinn's familiar inner voice, echoing in everyone's mind—No wonder Ryn dares to hit Dad. He knew Dad wouldn't report it. That guy's ruthless!

""Despicable!"" someone growled.

Everyone clenched their teeth as anger flashed in their eyes.

There was no way they could let this go.

If they didn't punish Ryn now, he would end up walking all over them next.

""Ryn's mental illness is acting up again. Contact the psychiatric hospital and have them take him away immediately!"" Eldric barked coldly.

""Oh, wow."" Ryn chuckled coldly. ""Impressive.""

Eldric was heartless enough to slap a ""mental illness"" label on him.

With the Vales' wealth and power in Riverville, no one would oppose it if Eldric said Ryn was insane.

This wouldn't just save Eldric's pride, it would also give him an excuse to take back the company shares Kingston had left Ryn. And better yet, it'd give the others free rein to torment him inside the psychiatric hospital. It was killing three birds with one stone.

Layla, for once, looked a little uncertain. ""Honey, maybe we should just drop this.""

""Yeah,"" Camila, Ryn's second eldest sister, frowned. ""If word gets out that someone in the Vales is mentally unstable, it'll damage our reputation.""

However, the eldest sister, Linette, sneered. ""No way. He dared to hit Dad today. What's next? What if he poisons the whole family? We can't let this monster go unpunished!""

Ryn's sixth sister, Serena, nodded fiercely. ""Exactly! He tried to hurt Quinn and Dad. I don't want a brother like him! I don't care even if he gets down and begs. He's finished.""

The sisters' tone was full of smug certainty.

They had completely decided Ryn's fate for him.

Quinn stood quietly at the side with a small grin.

He pretended to play peacemaker while secretly stirring the pot with his inner voice.

Ryn let out a cold laugh and pulled out his phone. He dialed a number and said flatly, ""Finn, you've been resting for a few years. I hope you haven't gone soft? Bring your men and come over to Vale Residence.""

""Finn?!""

The room gasped.

Eldric turned pale, and his voice cracked as he shouted, ""You fool! Why are you calling him? Are you trying to start a war?!""

Finn Ashford was 56 this year.

He was Kingston's most trusted right-hand man, a founding member of Vale Group and a legend in both the underworld and high society.

He had deep ties to the business and political worlds, and he controlled a number of shadowy forces that few knew about. Back in the day, he often helped Kingston eliminate his rivals behind the scenes.

Ryn had been foolish in his previous life due to the one-sided affection he had for the Vales.

Even knowing that Kingston had left Finn behind specifically to protect him and ensure a smooth inheritance, Ryn had chosen to distance himself just because the rest of the family disliked the idea of the two getting close.

Now that he had a second chance at life, he wasn't going to make that mistake again.

Power is what matters. To hell with my family.

Less than five minutes later, the sound of roaring engines echoed outside the villa. Under the stunned eyes of everyone present, an older man in a tailored suit marched through the front gates, flanked by over 20 bodyguards. They surged through the estate like a tidal wave, filling the air with overwhelming pressure.

""Hello, Mr. Ryn!""

The bodyguards greeted Ryn in unison, their voices booming.

Finn walked forward, leaning lightly on a cane. The moment he appeared, the entire room went silent.

""F-Finn, what do think you're doing by bringing all these people here?"" Eldric stammered, his voice cracking with fear.

Finn glanced around, and it didn't take long for him to understand the situation. He slowly stepped behind Ryn and scoffed. ""Mr. Ryn called, so, of course, I have to be here. Even random strays think they can bully Mr. Ryn now. If Mr. Kingston is watching from the heavens, he'd be cursing you out.""

""That brat hurt his brother and beat me up! Don't I have the right to discipline him?"" Eldric's excuse reeked of guilt.

Finn snorted. ""Go on, then. Try disciplining him now.""


Chapter 3 I'll Disown You on the Spot


Two sides stood locked in a standoff.

And clearly, Finn had the upper hand.

Though Eldric had taken over as chairman of Vale Group after Kingston's death and his connections and wealth were top-tier in all of Riverville, even he couldn't shake an old titan like Finn so easily.

Finn still held control over countless underworld forces.

If things got truly ugly, Eldric wouldn't stand a chance.

""Hah!""

Ryn casually tossed the cane aside.

He swaggered over to the couch and sat down like he owned the place.

He slowly swept his gaze across his family members and saw every one of them wearing expressions of fury and hatred. All he felt was a bitter irony.

In his previous life, he had been framed over and over again. He was always explaining, enduring beatings, and trying so hard to win them over.

But all he got from his family was mockery and disdain.

This time, all he had to do was throw a tantrum and call for backup—and suddenly, all the Vales could do was tremble with impotent rage.

It was funny. Who would've guessed that cutting off all emotional ties with the family could feel this damn good?

""Haven't you realized?"" Ryn leaned back on the couch and mocked. ""'I'm the type to directly deal with problems. I can even have Finn tie you up and feed you to the sharks. I won't waste my time with pathetic little tricks. Your beloved Quinn is acting like a whiny girl, framing people left and right. Has he been watching too many power struggle dramas or what?""

""I-I didn't!"" Quinn quickly waved his hands, panicking.

However, the rest of the Vales couldn't help shooting him a few doubtful glances.

After all, Ryn had just beaten Eldric bloody in front of everyone.

Would someone like that sneak peanut butter into anything?

""I didn't frame Ryn! Mom, Dad, you believe me, right?"" Quinn cried anxiously, but in his heart, he thought, Why would I risk my life just to harm Ryn? An allergy can kill someone! He clearly just wants an excuse to blow up and cut ties with the family. Why is he blaming me now?

The Vales' expressions shifted slightly.

One by one, they looked at Ryn with disdain.

""Hahaha!""

Ryn chuckled coldly.

What a joke! So, this is the petty little trick that got me killed last time?

Now that he could hear Quinn's true thoughts, he realized how shallow the family was.

As long as he didn't give a damn about family, Quinn's manipulations were completely useless.

He could even expose every one of Quinn's lies and force them to wake up. But there was no point in doing so. They were all just strangers he was planning to cut ties with anyway. He didn't want to waste time ""saving"" them.

""Finn,"" Ryn said casually, pulling a tissue to wipe the blood from his face. ""Feed Quinn a little peanut butter.""

""Yes, Mr. Ryn.""

Finn replied without so much as a blink.

He waved a hand, and two bodyguards stepped forward instantly.

""W-What do you want?""

""You're going crazy again, aren't you?""

Quinn turned pale as a ghost.

The Vales rushed to shield him like he was some rare treasure.

""Anyone who dares play petty tricks in front of me should be ready to face the consequences,"" Ryn raised an eyebrow, saying with complete sincerity. ""Didn't Quinn accuse me of secretly putting peanut butter in his food to trigger his allergy? Well, I should verify that accusation, right?""

""Don't you dare!"" Eldric roared.

""And why the hell wouldn't I?"" Ryn kicked the coffee table aside with a loud crash and shouted, ""Anyone who messes with me will have to pay the price! What, you think you can protect him? Men, force-feed him!""

""Got it!""

The two bodyguards shoved the others aside like nothing and grabbed Quinn by the collar.

""Dad! Mom! Help me—please!

""Peanut allergies can kill!

""Help me! I really didn't frame him—""

His inner voice kept spilling out in panic, Why is Ryn doing this? Is it because Mom, Dad, and our sisters like me more? He's trying to kill me! Oh no! What if I never see them again?

""Stop it!"" Layla snapped. ""If you touch him, I'll disown you on the spot!""

""You little shit, are you trying to destroy this family?""

""Quinn is our brother! How can you hurt him?""

""You've gone too far. If you don't stop now, don't blame us for cutting you off!""

The sisters yelled at Ryn one after another, their voices sharp and angry.

If this had been the old Ryn, their words would've sliced straight into his heart.

However, they were like squawking clowns to him now.

In front of everyone, the bodyguards marched out of the kitchen with a jar of peanut butter.

One of them grabbed Quinn's jaw, pried it open, and stuffed his mouth with peanut butter. 

No matter how Quinn screamed, struggled, or cried, he still ended up swallowing it.

The Vales tried to rush forward and stop it, but the bodyguards held them back with ease.

These weren't just regular bodyguards. Finn's men were all former special forces and professional international security agents. The villa's regular bodyguards didn't stand a chance.

At that moment, the entire family was nothing but lambs waiting for the slaughter.

Once Quinn had been force-fed the entire jar, the scene finally settled down.

""Hurry! Get him to the hospital!"" Eldric barked frantically, waving the maids over.

They scrambled to carry Quinn out as he wheezed and gagged.

Ryn scoffed and didn't stop them.

He has too many secrets. Killing him now would be too boring.

Now that I can hear his thoughts, it's way more fun keeping him alive. Let him stay in the light while I hunt him from the shadows.

Ryn said lazily, stretching back on the couch, ""Mr. and Mrs. Vale, will you be leaving on your own, or do I need to have someone show you the door?""

Eldric exploded. ""What? I'm your father! What do you mean by ‘Mr. Vale'? Are you seriously trying to kick us out of the house?""

Ryn narrowed his eyes and smirked. ""I said anyone who pisses me off will be kicked out. You didn't think I was joking, did you? What? Should I just sit around and wait for your precious son to frame me again and again?""

""You're the one who hurt Quinn! You think we're blind?""

""The Vales aren't yours to command. Who the hell do you think you are to throw us out?""

The sisters jumped in furiously again.

Layla sneered. ""Don't think that just because Kingston gave you the villa, you can do whatever you want. You're still a minor. Everything you have is still under guardian control. If you go off the rails again, I'll call the police! Do you think Finn can protect you from everything?""

Eldric clenched his teeth. ""I'd rather blow this whole thing wide open than have the news get out that I, the chairman of Vale Group, was kicked out of my own home!""

Ryn shrugged and replied, ""You can stay. I don't care. Either way, a year from now, we'll cut ties for good. Until then, just don't mess with me again. If you do, I won't hold back.

""Finn, put security in the villa. I want guards stationed here full-time. Clear out all the rooms on the second floor. From now on, no one goes up there unless I say so.""

""Understood.""

Finn responded without hesitation.

The Vales were so furious they felt dizzy.

They honestly couldn't believe this was the same Ryn who used to be so weak and easy to push around.


Chapter 4 Returning to Simplicity


There were four bedrooms in total on the second floor.

They were the sunniest and most spacious suites of the villa.

Back then, one was used as a study while the remaining three were occupied by Eldric and Layla, Ryn, and Linette.

However, things had changed quickly ever since Quinn moved in. Ryn's room had been taken away without a second thought.

He was shoved into the maids' quarters.

Now that the family had completely fallen out with him, Ryn didn't see any reason to hold back anymore. With a wave of his hand, he ordered the bodyguards to toss everything out. One by one, all the items from the second floor were thrown out like trash.

From now on, that entire floor belonged to him alone.

""This little shit!""

Eldric was so furious he almost had a heart attack.

While the family doctor bandaged his wounds, he was also desperately feeding him heart pills.

He was afraid that Eldric would stop breathing altogether from sheer rage.

""Mom, Dad, are you really going to let him do this?"" Linette complained. ""He threw all my stuff out. Where am I supposed to sleep now?""

""There are still guest rooms on the third and fourth floors."" Layla sighed helplessly. ""Let's just move up there for now. That ungrateful brat has gone completely mad. And with Finn backing him, there's nothing we can do at the moment. We'll just have to endure it for now.""

""No way! How long are we supposed to keep enduring?"" Linette's beautiful face twisted in frustration. ""Guest rooms? Seriously? I'm not staying in some tiny room like a peasant!""

""Then shut up and go argue with him yourself,"" Eldric snapped. ""See if he gives a damn about your opinion.""

Linette instantly fell silent.

Her face was full of resentment and unwillingness.

No matter how she turned it over in her mind, she couldn't figure it out. How had her younger brother who used to tiptoe around them suddenly become so different? Was he really mentally ill?

""Mom, Dad…"" Roxanne, the fourth sister, spoke softly. ""Don't you think something's off today? Ryn was never the type to hurt people. If he exploded like that, maybe we really did accuse him unfairly?""

""No way!"" Linette scoffed coldly. ""Ever since Quinn moved in, how many times has Ryn framed him? A guy with a record like his has no right to claim innocence.""

""Yeah! Have you forgotten how he pushed Quinn down the stairs?""

""Last month, he broke a vase and tried to pin it on Quinn. He even stole Quinn's allowance!""

""And don't forget—he led others to bully Quinn at school. There's hard evidence for all of it!""

The sisters all chimed in, their faces filled with disgust.

Eventually, they reached the same conclusion—Ryn was just a bad seed.

He used to pretend to be pitiful and innocent, but he didn't bother to hide it now.

""If we'd known that ungrateful brat would turn out like this, we should've strangled him at birth,"" Layla growled through gritted teeth. ""Now, he has learned how to bite. What a monster we raised.""

""Mom, don't forget—he said twice that he wants to cut ties with us,"" Linette added, fanning the flames. ""In a year, he'll be 18. Once he inherits Grandpa's 30% shares and other things—and with Finn and the board members supporting him—we'll be the ones getting kicked out.""

Everyone's expressions changed again.

It was easy to go from rags to riches, but the reverse was a real nightmare.

They were long used to being admired and praised.

If they lost their money and power one day, that would feel worse than death.

""Don't worry."" Layla forced a smile, trying to calm everyone. ""Ryn just talks tough, but he's soft on the inside. He's thrown fits before, hasn't he? As long as we butter him up a bit, he'll be wagging his tail again in no time. Just be nice to him for a few days.""

""Exactly. No grudge lasts overnight in a family,"" Eldric added, laughing awkwardly. ""You girls just be extra sweet to him. Once he comes around, I'll talk him into giving Quinn a little share of his inheritance.""

Linette nodded and sneered. ""Right. He's just a spoiled little brat acting out to get attention. Give it a few days and ease up on the yelling. He'll be crawling back like before.""

Roxanne didn't say a word.

Unlike the other arrogant members of the Vale family, she was a top-tier screenwriter and a well-known painter. Her insights into human nature were sharper than most.

She noticed Ryn was not throwing tantrums like a child.

He was serious about cutting ties this time, and no amount of sweet talk would fix it.

""We should go check on Quinn,"" she said, changing the subject. ""After all that peanut butter, who knows if he's still in emergency care? What if he doesn't make it?""

""Right, right. Let's go to the hospital!""

""How could we forget about him? Get the car ready!""

The Vales were once again in a frenzy.

Even Eldric, with bandages wrapped around his head and half his face swollen, didn't care about his appearance.

After he pulled on a coat and hat, the whole family rushed out the door in a panic.

...

At the emergency department of Heartstone Hospital.

The hospital director, Damian Lynch, and the ER chief, James Lewis, were already waiting with a full team to welcome the Vales.

""Dr. Lynch, how's my son?"" Eldric asked with a deep frown. ""He's severely allergic to peanuts, and he accidentally ate a large amount this time. Is he still in critical condition?""

Damian smiled awkwardly and nodded toward the man beside him.

""Dr. Lewis, I think you should explain.""

""Yes, of course."" James wiped the sweat from his brow, his expression complicated. ""Actually, there's nothing to worry about, Mr. Vale. Mr. Quinn isn't allergic at all.""

""Not allergic? Are you kidding me?""

The Vales gasped in unison.

James swallowed hard and nodded. ""It's true. He wasn't having an allergic reaction. His nose and mouth were just blocked by peanut butter, which caused some brief choking. A simple rinse cleared it right up. He's resting comfortably in the ward.

With that, James led the group straight to Quinn's ward.

When they saw him perfectly fine in bed, their expressions darkened.

""You guys ... Why are you all here?"" Quinn looked startled and explained, ""Sorry, I think I made a mistake. I guess I'm not allergic to peanuts, after all ... ""

A strange, suffocating silence enveloped the ward.

Even the dumbest of them could tell something was off.

But before anyone could speak, Quinn's whiny inner voice was heard once again. Oh no! What should I do? Mom and Dad are totally going to think I framed Ryn on purpose! But I really don't know what happened! Maybe I'm not allergic, after all? Or maybe I ate something else previously? This is a total mess. I can't explain it at all!

""Don't overthink it,"" Layla said gently, her eyes softening. ""It's all just a misunderstanding. Just be more careful next time, okay?""

""Yeah, I will!"" Quinn nodded. At the same time, his inner voice was dripping with flattery. Oh my god, Mom actually believes me? She's not mad even after such a huge mix-up? She's seriously the best mom in the world!

""Alright, silly boy. If you're fine, let's get you home.""

""Yeah, I'm glad that you're okay. Maybe you're allergic to something else. We should have the doctors run a few more tests.""

""It's just a misunderstanding. There's no need to dwell on it.""

Everyone smiled and laughed as if nothing had happened.

Only Roxanne's expression remained strange.

She couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.


Chapter 5 A Small Goal


In the second-floor study, Ryn and Finn sat across from each other at a coffee table.

Two bodyguards stood firmly at the door, ensuring no one could come near.

Ryn personally brewed the coffee and politely poured a cup. ""Finn, have some coffee.""

""You've grown up, Mr. Ryn,"" Finn said with a warm smile as admiration glowed in his eyes. He was clearly impressed by Ryn's recent actions.

""Just call me Ryn."" He sighed. ""From now on, you're the only family I have left.""

""Are you really going to cut ties with them?"" Finn was stunned.

""Mhm.""

Ryn nodded silently, saying no more.

The Vales were blind and heartless. Ryn didn't want them to be part of them anymore. As soon as he came of age, he planned to make a public announcement severing all ties. He didn't even want to be associated with them at all.

But Finn? Finn was different. Ryn trusted him.

He had no wife or children of his own and had been loyal all his life.

He had watched Ryn grow up, and the love he gave was no less than Kingston.

""There's something strange about Quinn,"" Ryn said quietly, taking a sip of tea. ""He has some weird power. He can let others hear his thoughts. Everyone in the Vales has already been completely taken in by him. If you hear his inner voice trying to sow discord one day, don't believe a word of it. You're all I've got.""

""His thoughts?"" Finn frowned but didn't look too surprised.

He had spent most of his life traveling the world with Kingston. He'd seen all kinds of bizarre things.

Since Ryn was warning him, he would take it seriously.

""Don't worry."" Finn narrowed his eyes as he leaned on his cane. ""Should I send someone to take care of him?""

""It's fine. All he has are a few cheap tricks. Keeping him around is actually more useful,"" Ryn replied while casually pouring another cup of coffee. At that moment, his calm presence made him already 70% like Kingston. He had everything entirely in control.

""This is great,"" Finn said, dabbing the corner of his eyes. ""Mr. Kingston finally has a worthy successor. From now on, I'll return to my old role and support you fully.""

""No."" Ryn shook his head. ""Being a butler is a waste of your talents. Eldric and the others are already wary of you. It's better if you work for me from the outside.""

""Is that so?"" Finn was intrigued.

He motioned for Ryn to continue.

Ryn took another sip of coffee and said, ""Since I'm cutting ties with the Vales, I need to start building power in secret. Otherwise, when I turn 18, I might not actually have the power to leave.

""Eldric may not be capable, but he's a master of schemes. I need you to move in the dark while I stir things up from within. One year from now, we'll strike together and destroy them from both sides.""

Finn frowned slightly. ""Don't you want to inherit Vale Group?""

""I do ... and I don't."" Ryn gave a helpless sigh. ""Vale Group is one of Riverville's biggest enterprises. From real estate to finance and tech to entertainment, it spans multiple industries and has a market value of over 50 billion dollars.

""If I can take control, expanding it further would be easy. This was Grandpa's life's work. Of course, I want to see it thrive.""

""But Eldric's roots in the company run deep. The place is infested with parasites. Even if I do get my hands on it, cleaning it up would be a nightmare. Might as well tear it down and start fresh.""

In short, Vale Group meant nothing to him.

Others might covet power and wealth, but Ryn had the courage to destroy and rebuild.

""Great! You're bold!"" Finn nodded approvingly. ""No wonder you were Kingston's favorite. He left you 30% of the company's shares, hundreds of real estate holdings, countless stocks, overseas manors, luxury cars, and cash. It'll be enough for you to build a whole new Vale Group from scratch.""

""It's not,"" Ryn said, shaking his head. ""I'm still underage. I have to wait another year to legally inherit everything. Until I hold it in my own hands, it's all talk. I need to build a solid foundation within this year.""

Finn nodded, agreeing with Ryn's words.

He pondered momentarily and said, ""You probably don't have much capital right now. I can free up a few billion dollars in cash by selling some property. I should be able to pull together two billion.""

""I don't need that much. Just lend me a hundred million dollars,"" Ryn said with a smile.

""What can you even do with that sum?"" Finn snorted. ""I've got no heirs. You'll be the one taking care of me in my old age. What's mine is yours. Why are you refusing it?""

""No, thanks."" Ryn shook his head and said, ""Honestly, I shouldn't even be borrowing the money from you. Grandpa always said a man should stand on his own. If I were handed a billion dollars in startup funds, where's the challenge in that?

""How about this, Finn? Set aside 300 million dollars and come play a game with me. Whatever profit we make in the next two weeks, we split it fifty-fifty. That way, it's an investment—not a loan. What do you say?""

Finn was secretly impressed.

What a gutsy young man. He really plans to make his first bucket of gold in just two weeks?

""You sure?"" Finn asked, skeptical. ""Three hundred million sounds like a lot, but no matter what industry you enter, that's barely a ripple. Two weeks isn't even enough time for product research or staffing.""

""Not in traditional industries, no. But when making fast money? It definitely is a lot of money."" Ryn smirked confidently. There wasn't a trace of doubt on his face.

He had been personally trained by Kingston from a young age.

His IQ was a staggering 180, and he had a photographic memory.

Thanks to the information overload in his previous life, making money now was easier than breathing.

He only needed a moment to recall every major and minor event that would happen in Riverville over the next seven or eight years. With that kind of foresight, even a pig could make a fortune—let alone him, with Finn backing him.

And as luck would have it, a big event was just around the corner.

Three hundred million dollars wasn't much, but it was enough to get a chunk of profit.

""In two days, the head of Zenith Group will die unexpectedly,"" Ryn said casually. ""After his death, their stock will plummet. On the third day, start buying up shares from small shareholders and absorb more from the market. Then, sell it all on the twelfth day.""

""Travis is going to die?""

Finn's breath hitched.

Travis Lloyd was barely in his forties and was in the prime of his life.

He wondered if it would still be worth investing in if Travis really died and the stock crashed.

""Just do as I say. And remember—only invest 300 million dollars. No more. Any more could change the outcome,"" Ryn said, not bothering to explain. Then, as if the matter were closed, he shifted the topic. ""Also, find time to buy the villa next door and place our people there. I'll need three teams of bodyguards around me—one for close-range protection when I go out and two to be placed on rotating shifts to guard the second floor at all times. No one's allowed to step into the study or my room without permission.

""Oh, and have the room on the far left of the second floor converted into a gym. Hire a few combat instructors and get me a proper training schedule. Also, the current maids and drivers should gradually be replaced with our men.""",1,1755029166.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Inspired by the Spartans, who used to drink a gnarly black pork broth before battle to summon their inner fury, I thought:
*""What if we fueled our resistance the same way… but, you know, with protest burritos?""*

**Here’s the game plan:**
Load up on beans, cabbage, eggs, coffee, sauerkraut, pickled onions — whatever turns your insides into a pressure cooker for justice.

Assemble peacefully in public spaces, the closer to the opposition, the better.

Let the resistance rip.

-Silent? Effective.

-Loud? Revolutionary.

Crop dusting a government building? First Amendment-protected flatulence.

**Safety First:**
We’re not animals; use VapoRub under the nostrils to protect your fellow patriots from collateral damage.

No weapons, no chemicals 
No arrests (They can’t throw you in jail for gastrointestinal freedom)

Someone has created the image for us!!!,"I am making this post to announce that someone has put forth a rough draft of the image of Armaaruss. This is a major turning point in human history.

For anyone new to this concept of Armaaruss, let me give a little bit of background,. My name is Anthony of Boston, a long-time student of Astrology. In 2019, I discovered a connection between the planet Mars and wars involving Israel. However, over the course of time, it became clear to me that this was more than a planet exerting influence--this was a powerful god influencing humanity. As I realized that this discovery was indeed a revelation from Satan, I began to publicly predict in real time the escalation of rocket attacks against Israel by observing when Mars would be within 30 degrees of the lunar node. Throughout the intervening period of making these predictions and revelations, I, at the behest of Satan, requested that humanity make an image to this god of war, which is to be an amalgamation of Ares, Mars and Horus. In return, the wars and violence would abate and peace would ensue. These requests were followed by more accurate predictions of escalated rocket attacks in the hopes that humanity would be compelled to put forth an image. It has taken years for someone to make the effort and now the wait is over.

After my successful prediction of the 12-day war between Israel and Iran which occurred while Mars was within 30 degrees of the lunar node, a woman named Jessica Mars contacted me about putting together the image of Armaaruss on June 24th and within hours of contacting me, a ceasefire between Israel and Iran went into effect. Was this a coincidence? I think not. Her and her girlfriend Hypatia arranged a visit to Boston on August 7th to sit down with me and discuss some ideas. They were both witnesses to my videos predicting escalated rocket attacks since 2019 and wanted to help. At this point, Jessica had already drafted the image, and Hypatia, a mathematician, was a major source of encouragement. We met for about 30 minutes at a cafe where we had a great conversation and coffee.

Here is the rough draft of Armaaruss--created by Jessica and is the image I personally endorse as the true look for Armaaruss. It is still under development and a completed painting from Jessica will arise soon. Here is Jessica's instagram page

[https://www.instagram.com/that\_trash\_stash](https://www.instagram.com/that_trash_stash)

and here is the long awaited image of Armaaruss. This is her work. This is a draft and the painting is currently underway.

This work of art has power and life. Armaaruss is now ready to answer prayers

For those new to this, Armaaruss is part of the Mars 360 framework and backed by public prophecies, which you can bear witness to right here:

For six consecutive years, I have been able to predict when the highest concentration of rocket fire against Israel would occur within a calendar year.

In the last six years it was predicted that the highest escalation of rocket fire against Israel within the calendar year would occur during the time when Mars would be within 30 degrees of the lunar node. Here are the dates of Mars/lunar node alignment from the past six years.

First Whispers of the Rot

I’ve seen a lot of bad headlines in my life. Wars, famines, riots, storms that chewed cities down to the foundation. But this morning, over burnt coffee in a dented tin mug, the radio gave me a new one:

""Unconfirmed reports of a viral outbreak in the Philippines, source still under investigation…""

They didn’t say much, just the usual dance; officials urging calm, news anchors wearing that fake composure that tells you they’ve already seen footage they’ll never air. But I caught something in the way the foreign correspondent’s voice cracked halfway through the segment. That wasn’t journalism. That was fear.

Rumors are rolling faster than truth ever will. Some say it’s flu. Some say it’s worse. I’ve heard “rabid” tossed around. Heard about people not staying down. Heard about eyes that cloud over like milk. The official line? “Under control.” Yeah. I’ve heard that one before.

The vet in me, the part they couldn’t strip away after all the dust, heat, and blood... is already counting supplies. Ammo, canned goods, clean water. The last IED I saw didn’t have the decency to give warning before it blew, and neither will this… if it’s real.

Still, I’m not the same green kid I was when I shipped out. I know the difference between panic and preparation. So I’m not panicking. I’m preparing. But between you and me, my hand’s been hovering over that old bug-out pack more than I’d like to admit.

Three months from now, this might be another half-forgotten blip in the endless noise machine. Or… maybe it’s the day the countdown started.

If it was the day… if the SHTF for real… where would you run first? Who would you trust to watch your back?

1moj5ym,https://i.redd.it/7xss3f889nif1.png,Has your theorizing hurt you or others?,"This message is to all the arm chair philosophers, theoretical math/physics pursuers, entrepreneurs, mystics, political revolutionaries, crypto-zoologists, and anyone else who has ever been called a fringe scientist. These are rules I live by and have helped me to ""eat my cake and have it too."" You can be happy, even respected in your interests/work, but it will take some serious mental gymnastics. I hope these cheat codes will help make it easier:

1. ""You can't have your cake and eat it too."" Is an oppressive and destructive Lie. You Can! Imagine a life where anyone with a remote interest in something wasn't allowed to have a family, or health, or social life. The universe would be boring. Instead strive to care for those around you, and have creeds that allow for your work, but put your humanity first. Reject burnout inducing rhetoric, health first, and your work will succeed.

2. You are not a genius. There is no such thing and there never was. The Dunning Kruger effect is real, and if you have never heard the phrase look it up. Only a Narcissist never asks ""am I a narcissist?"" That does not mean your idea is not smart. That does not mean you were not a savant as a child in something. You can be good at everything and a master of none. Or you can be a dedicated craftsman destroyed by the new. If you are to succeed, you actually have to NOT be a genius. Genius is mom hype, from mothers who do not know better. Encourage learning, not rumination.

3. Do not ruminate. If you find yourself checking responses over and over, you are not studying/making more. If you are not doing/learning you are not improving. Praise is the enemy of progress when you stop to stare. That is the mind disbelieving you are responsible for this response, which is a symptom of depression, not investment or pride. Value a positive response or negative response much less than you value your craft. There is no such thing as bad press, unless it puts others or yourself in harm's way.

4. Harm none, do what ye will.

5. Phrases like ""starving artist"" or ""conspiracy theories"" are not learning from the past, they are slurs. Belief that you must suffer for work that helps others is absurd. Now if your work does not help others, maybe you should meditate on utility. Help is not the same as please. Do not seek to please, but do no harm all the same.

6. Pick your battles. It is easy to, and good to feel indignation at injustice, abuse or inequality. But remember, it only exists because someone overpowered someone trying to stop it. This can be done systemically, by age or positional power abuse, and even with good but uninformed intentions. In order to pick your battles, you can not focus on the problem only. You also cannot effect change on your own. If you feel like something needs to be changed, either start a group, find one, or find someone who can start it. Don't just voice your anger or opinion, achieve the actual goal. Listen to dissent and criticism. If you can't face constructive, you will stand no chance against destructive.

7. Put it down. If you feel agitated, stuck, making silly basic errors, you are trying to win and not trying to do. This happens because your body is literally shutting you down in some way. Maybe you forgot to drink water, maybe it's burnout, maybe you are just too close to see the whole picture. I found out that I personally can not think of ideas and write/draw them at the same time, so I separate the tasks. I quickly, and messily copy down the ideas. And then I cleanse my mental palate with meditation or a walk, and enter flow, seeing the work, not the idea I started with. Some tasks take all of your resources. You might not be bad at it, you might just need two brains. Doing the work is possible, it might just need to be separated out entirely from the ideation.

8. You are not the first to think your thought. A lot of thoughts are either not acted on, or even dismissed, or just simply less interesting to the thinker vs another idea. No matter what it is, don't be discouraged or disappointed if someone thought of it first. The likelihood you have thought of it first is nearly impossible. It does not matter. Remember the phrase ""yeah but they did it."" And secondly ""but you can do it better"". If someone has already done the thing, congratulations, you just figured out it's doable! Do it too.

9. Medication is just fancy coffee (or whatever). Know that if people are trying to get you to see a therapist or get meds, it is not because they think you are crazy or your ideas are bad, it's because they are scared for you or of you or both. I was terrified of getting on meds. I was, like many neurodivergents, used like a labrat, taking whatever anti-depressents doctors saw fit. Science has come a long way since then. You are not going to ""lose your sparkle"". If you are willing to take medication into your own hands, why not consult someone with a lot of research? It's just more available information.

10. As for therapy. Listen closely. Every human on earth, no matter how sane they think they are, should have a therapist they see at least once a month. Period. Therapy is not punishment for crazy, it's someone paid to listen. Want your own staff for your project or business? Hire the cheapest consultant imaginable who will always go above and beyond, and rarely contradict you unless they think you'll get hurt. Hire a therapist, they are great. And if you didn't like it, you don't even have to fire them, you just go get a different one.

11. False dichotomies are everywhere, even in your own ideas. I write scripts and every once in a while I will get into a debate like this: "" do I make this character godlike, or nerf them?"". This might not look like it, but this is one of many false dichotomies. This is any idea presented to only have two options. For the previous question, I didn't have to take away the power of the character, rather, I had to find bigger obstacles in the story. Sometimes the idea or observation we have comes from a perspective built of faulty language, rather than ideas.

12. Asking questions always gains more listeners. People who are involved in fringe subjects tend to remain involved due to passion more than occupation. Because of this and many other factors, it is extremely easy to end up speaking at people, than with. And people do not usually like being spoken at. People usually are not open to admitting they are wrong, so saying it upfront will only get you ignored faster. Instead, share examples, listen for audiences intersectional interests, ask questions, create activities that demonstrate a principal. If you have actively engaged in something that influenced your decision, put that up first, and your course of action second. For all of you with ADHD, look up top-down-thinking. Trust me. Also a public speaking class doesn't hurt.

13. Finally, have fun with it if you can. The likelihood that others will join you or listen to you almost completely depends on whether joining and listening to you is appealing. It sucks, it's vain and boring, but it's just biology. Believe it or not, if you give a complete random person a task to do, usually they will do It. If you command them to take a stance, they will often, even violently respond. Whatever the upside to your idea, research or discovery, highlight that. Invite friends to go star gazing at places that have UAPs, help with wildlife conservation near a cryptid you are studying, ask a geologist or chemist about the properties of rocks, go to cultural festivals respectfully, go to an open mic night at a local cafe. There is an uncountable infinity of better ideas than your current one, and even more than that, the way you are going about it. Spend some time on that.",1,1755028649.0,Witchzards,0,1.0,False

1moj5me,https://www.reddit.com/r/JobsPhilippines/comments/1moj5me/pickup_coffee_internship_interview_experience/,PICKUP Coffee Internship Interview Experience,"Summary: 
The worst company I applied for an internship due to incomplete job description details and inefficient job application process.

Fun Fact:
PICKUP Coffee Internship are full-time on-site 5-days a week. Not negotiable for hybrid or remote. Unpaid internship.

Full Details:
I applied online for an intern role after seeing a hiring post on Facebook. Job descriptions are missing tho. I received a reply and invite for an interview to be on-site at First Lucky Place Bldg, Makati.

I was hesitant to continue 'cause it's already 2025. Why the h would you conduct an on-site interview for an intern role? Even big FMCG, banks, advertising agencies do it completely online. But went for it because I am passionate in immersing myself in F&B industry.

So during interview date, they were 40 minutes late. They asked me to fill out a job application form via pen and paper. This is so old-fashioned, such a waste of time and paper, tbh. Most of that information are actually written in my resume/CV. Or could've been improved by filling that out online. Considering it's just an intern role. I already have 3 internship experience and 1 part-time experience, never experienced that. This one has so many unnecessary processes. It feels like applying for a job 10 years ago. It's so inefficient.

The HR did the initial interview. Just after I said I was applying for the intern role, she clarified that they actually accepted 2 already. They need to verify if they'll need another. Then, why invite me for an interview if the position is already filled out? This is so disrespectful.

Also, she's not even aware of common business college program. She lowkey/indirectly asked if my college program has correlation to the role I was applying for. Like be for real.

By that time, I actually didn't want to continue anymore. But I went through it since I'm there. She asked an extremely basic questions like ""what are your expectations"", ""how many hours and how long can you render?"". I mentioned that I was actually going for a hybrid setup. That was the time they only clarified the complete work setup details. There's no real point to continue. We ended the interview. Didn't proceed to the panel interview (with the team I was applying for) obviously because of the conflicts within the setup. Although she didn't explicitly said it was rejected. She just said she'll ask if that work setup can be approved lol. Then proceeded by saying that the next interview will be conducted via online meeting. Like be for real. If you can conduct an online meeting with the team, then why did you make me come to the office for an on-site interview?

The interview just lasted for less than 10 minutes. I literally wasted my time. Everything that went thru the process could've been done via phone call or online meeting to save time. This is so disrespectful.

Can I just say unpaid full-time on-site internships should be illegal at this point? It's giving exploitation.

The worst interview and application process ever. Thankfully, on that day itself I got the intern job offer already from another company I applied weeks prior. And another interview invite for different company. All conducted online.

With the two coffees I can make a direct comparison with, the finish is certainly cleaner; as well as taking the same coffee up a level, I think there might be a resulting wider grind window too.  So far, the improvements don’t seem to be at the expense of flavour but I’m very much biased towards clean and I have a limited sample size at the moment.

Don’t recall seeing much see much mention of Sainsbury’s water on here, Tesco/Waitrose and Volvic are very much the prevalent go-to suggestions. Anyone else have any UK, bottled water experiences to share?

Posted the label (also Waitrose as the last photo). TDS is about 120, hardness is low, alkalinity is low but you’re starting from a pH of 7.8.

So, I (23M) came across this guy on Hinge, and he had his Instagram on his profile. I reached out to him and told him I'm from Hinge so he'd know my intentions. I was honestly surprised he responded; that doesn't usually happen. We started to have a conversation and eventually talked about his job; he's an associate at a law firm. About three days after we started talking, I asked him to grab coffee, but he was actually in town for work so he said that he just left the area. He said he'd be back in town next month and would be down to grab coffee then. I told him that was fine, and we continued the conversation. (I'm fine with long distance.)
So far, his responses have taken about 24 hours, but when he does respond, it feels like he puts effort in, and he asks me follow-up questions. I can't tell if he's at least somewhat interested because 24 hours feels very long. I just don't want to waste my time or his. It's super, super early—I honestly don't expect too much communication-wise—but I just don't want to waste time. What are your thoughts?

He was my entire world.



On my eighteenth birthday, I gathered all my courage to confess my love to him.



But his reaction was a fury I had never seen before. He swept my birthday cake to the floor and roared, ""Are you insane? I am your GUARDIAN!""



He then mercilessly tore the painting I had spent a year on-my confession-to shreds.



Just days later, he brought home his fiancée, Chloe.



The man who had promised to wait for me to grow up, who called me his brightest star, had vanished. My decade of desperate, burning love had only managed to burn myself.



The person who was supposed to protect me had become the one who hurt me the most.



I looked down at the NYU acceptance letter in my hand. I had to leave. I had to pull him out of my heart, no matter how much it hurt.



I picked up the phone and dialed my father's number.



Dad, I said, my voice hoarse, ""I've decided. I want to come be with you in New York.""





Chapter1 No.1

The eighteenth day of giving up on Ethan Hayes began with Ava deleting the photo on her phone's lock screen.



It was a candid shot she had secretly taken.



Ethan was sitting on the sofa, bathed in the afternoon sun, a financial magazine resting on his knee. He was looking at her, a faint, almost imperceptible smile on his lips.



For a full ten years, from the age of eight to eighteen, this man had been the sun in her world.



Her joy, her anger, her sorrow, her entire world revolved around him.



But now, she wanted to extinguish that sun with her own hands.



The screen went black.



A clean, stark black, leaving nothing behind.



Ava's fingers trembled slightly as she put the phone down and picked up the glass of milk on the table. It was already cold.



She drank it in one gulp, the cold liquid sliding down her throat, but it couldn't suppress the burning sensation in her ch\*\*t.



She picked up her phone again and dialed a number she hadn't contacted in a long time.



The call connected quickly. A man's gentle voice came through.



Ava?



Dad, she called out, her voice a little hoarse. ""I got my acceptance letter. NYU.""



Her father was silent for a moment, then his voice filled with unconcealed joy. ""That's wonderful! Ava, congratulations. Art History, right? The department you always dreamed of.""



Yes.



So, you've decided? You're coming to New York?



I've decided, Ava said, her grip on the phone tightening. ""I want to come be with you.""



She wanted to escape this place. She wanted to escape Ethan Hayes.



Her father seemed to sense the emotion in her voice. He sighed softly. ""Is it because of Ethan? Did he give you a hard time again?""



No, Ava lied, forcing a relaxed tone. ""He's getting engaged. I can't just keep living in his house as his ward, not now. It feels wrong. Besides, I'm an adult now. It's time I learned to be on my own.""



A heavy silence followed.



After a long while, her father's voice, full of heartache, came through the phone. ""My poor Ava. It's been hard on you all these years, living in that house because I couldn't... It's good that you're coming. Dad will take care of you from now on.""



He added, ""Our family's business is back on track. You don't need to depend on anyone anymore. Dad can support you.""



The warmth of his words made Ava's eyes sting.



She sniffled, holding back the tears. ""Okay.""



After hanging up, she looked at herself in the mirror. Her eyes were red and swollen.



Ten years. She had spent a full ten years loving a man who would never belong to her.



She had to leave.



She had to pull Ethan Hayes out of her heart, piece by piece, no matter how much it hurt.



Taking a deep breath, she walked out of her room. The light in the study at the end of the hall was on.



Ethan was still working.



She hesitated for a moment, then walked over, clutching the NYU acceptance letter. She needed to tell him.



She stopped at the half-open door. Through the gap, she could see the man inside.



He wore a simple gray shirt, his posture upright and his expression focused. The light from the lamp cast a soft glow on his sharp profile, outlining a face so handsome it seemed unreal. A pair of gold-rimmed glasses sat on his high nose, giving his cold demeanor a touch of refined elegance.



This was Ethan Hayes. Her father's former protégé, the brilliant young man who had stayed loyal when her family's business crumbled. When her parents divorced and her mother left the country, it was her father, at his lowest point, who had asked Ethan to become her legal guardian. He was the man who had raised her.



Her guardian, with no bl\*\*d relation.



And the man she had secretly loved for ten years.



Ethan, she called out softly, her voice barely a wh\*\*per.



Ethan looked up, his brow furrowed slightly as he saw her. ""What is it?""



His voice was as cold and distant as ever.



Ava's heart clenched. She was about to speak when his phone on the desk rang, a crisp, pleasant tone.



His cold expression melted the moment he saw the caller ID. A gentleness she had never seen before bloomed in his eyes.



Chloe, he said, his voice low and soft.



It was his fiancée, Chloe Vance.



The venue? You decide, I'm fine with anything. Don't worry about the cost. He listened to the person on the other end, the corner of his mouth curving into a doting smile. ""As long as you like it, nothing else matters.""



Ava stood frozen at the door, her hands and feet turning to ice.



The acceptance letter in her hand felt like it weighed a thousand pounds.



She suddenly remembered her eighteenth birthday, just two months ago. She had gathered all her courage to give him a painting she had worked on for a year, titled Secret.



In the painting, a young girl followed a man's back, her eyes full of love.



It was her confession.



Ethan's reaction was a fury she had never seen before.



He swept all the gifts off the table, the cake crashing to the floor.



Ava Miller! he had roared, his eyes red with rage. ""Are you insane? I am your GUARDIAN!""



She had stubbornly argued back, tears streaming down her face. ""But we're not related by bl\*\*d! My dad trusted you! And the way you've always indulged me... that's not how a guardian is supposed to treat his ward!""



He had sneered, his handsome face contorted with cruelty. ""Can't you tell the difference between familial affection and love? Your education has been a waste.""



With that, he had mercilessly torn her painting, her Secret, to shreds.



He had turned and left without a backward glance, leaving her alone in the wreckage of her birthday.



She had cried and picked up the pieces, carefully taping them back together. But the painting, like her heart, was covered in scars.



Even then, she hadn't given up.



She thought that as long as she was good enough, as long as she got into his alma mater, he would see her.



But just after her graduation, he brought Chloe Vance home.



He had introduced her with a smile. ""Ava, this is Chloe, my fiancée.""



That was the moment she knew.



It was truly over.



All her desperate, burning love for the past ten years had only burned herself.



Now, she had to be the one to extinguish the fire.



She had to get him out of her heart.





Chapter 2  No.2

Ethan was still on the phone, his voice gentle and patient as he discussed the details of the engagement party with Chloe.



Ava stood silently at the door, listening to the voice that had once been her entire world.



She quietly swallowed the words she had been about to say.



What was the point of telling him?



She was just his ward, his responsibility. Which university she went to, where she went... he wouldn't care.



She turned and walked away, her steps light, as if she was afraid of disturbing the sweet scene inside.



Back in her room, she looked around the space she had lived in for ten years.



There were fifteen days left.



In fifteen days, she would leave this place completely.



Her gaze fell on the small lamp on her nightstand. It was shaped like a chinchilla, a gift from Ethan for her tenth birthday. The light it cast was a warm, soft yellow.



He had told her then, ""Ava, from now on, I will be like this chinchilla, protecting you always.""



He had been her protector.



But that was all in the past.



She reached out and turned off the lamp. The room was plunged into darkness.



It was time to pack.



She pulled a dusty old suitcase from the back of her closet and opened the display cabinet.



Inside were all the gifts Ethan had given her over the years.



A lucky charm he'd stood in line for hours to get from a tiny, renowned artisan shop. A custom-blended perfume he had personally created for her.



One by one, she placed them into the suitcase.



With each item, her heart felt a little emptier, as if a hole was being torn open inside her.



She pressed down the feeling of desolation and opened the bottom drawer of the cabinet.



Inside lay a faded, yellowed notebook.



It was her diary.



The first few pages were filled with childish scrawls, recording her turbulent childhood after her parents' divorce and the bullying she endured from classmates.



Ethan had accidentally seen it once.



He hadn't said anything then, but later that night, he had come to her room and sat by her bed.



He had gently st\*\*ked her hair and told her, ""Ava, you are the brightest star in my eyes.""



She later found out he had gone to her school and warned the bullies. From then on, no one had dared to bother her again.



He had secretly protected her childhood.



As she grew up, her handwriting in the diary became neater, and the entries were all about him.



About the time he won a major award and told her, ""You are my medal of honor.""



About the time he gave her a rose and said, ""I'll wait for you to grow up.""



She flipped to the last page. It was a message he had written for her when she was a high school sophomore.



Study hard and get into Wharton. After you graduate, you can come work at my company. I'll keep looking out for you.



A tear fell silently, blurring the ink on the page.



She quickly wiped her eyes, her expression hardening.



She began to tear the diary, page by page.



With each torn page, a piece of her past with him was erased.



When the last page was torn, she threw all the fragments into the suitcase and zipped it shut.



Just then, she heard a noise from downstairs.



She walked out of her room and saw Chloe Vance standing in the living room, pulling a suitcase behind her. Ethan was hugging her from behind.



You're here, Ethan said, his voice soft.



Chloe saw Ava on the stairs and smiled, walking over. ""Ava, I brought you a gift.""



She opened her suitcase and took out a delicate box. Inside was a beautiful little cake, a mango mousse topped with fresh fruit.



Ava's smile tightened.



She was severely allergic to mangoes.



She remembered one time when a new housekeeper had served a dessert with mango puree, and she'd had a terrifying allergic reaction, ending up in the emergency room.



Ethan had fired the housekeeper on the spot and had made the kitchen a strict no-mango zone ever since.



He used to remember every preference, every vulnerability.



Ava, Ethan's voice came from behind Chloe, a hint of displeasure in his tone. ""Chloe picked it out for you. Take it.""



Ava looked at Ethan. He had an expression that said it was only natural.



Her heart ached with a dull pain.



He had not only taken back his affection, but he had also forgotten her weaknesses.



She took a deep breath, took the box, forcing a smile.



Thank you, Chloe. It's beautiful.



But she didn't care anymore.



In fact, she should thank them.



Thank them for making her decision to leave even firmer.





Chapter 3  No.3

Chloe stayed the night.



Ava lay in her bed, the thin walls unable to block out the ambiguous sounds coming from the next room.



Sl\*\*p was impossible.



She got up and went to the balcony, lighting a cigarette. She had secretly learned to sm\*\*e a long time ago.



The bitter taste filled her mouth, just like the bitterness in her heart.



The next morning, she went downstairs with dark circles under her eyes.



Chloe, looking refreshed and glowing, pulled her over to the sofa.



Ava, Ethan's birthday is coming up. What kind of party do you think he'd like? A seaside theme?



The faint red marks on Chloe's neck were just visible above her collar. They were like needles, pricking Ava's eyes.



She remembered walking with Ethan on a beach one evening. She had told him she loved the sea.



He had promised her that from then on, every one of his birthdays would be celebrated by the sea.



Back then, his eyes were full of her.



Now, he avoided her like the plague. He had forgotten everything she liked and disliked.



Just as Ava was about to speak, Ethan interrupted from the kitchen. ""If you want to know about my affairs, you should ask me directly.""



Chloe pouted playfully. ""I just thought Ava would know you better.""



Ava forced a smile, her heart aching. ""I don't know him that well.""



She stood up to leave, the bitterness in her heart threatening to overwhelm her.



Where are you going so early? Ethan's voice, suddenly cold, stopped her.



Ava's heart trembled. ""I have an appointment to get my visa.""



Chloe looked surprised. ""A visa? Are you going on a trip? With your boyfriend?""



Ethan's brow furrowed, his tone sharp with disapproval. ""Ava, I don't want you getting involved with anyone until you're settled in college.""



His cold condemnation hit her heart. She didn't even have the strength to explain.



Chloe smoothed things over with a smile. ""Oh, Ethan, don't be so strict. Ava is a big girl. It's normal to fall in love.""



Ethan and Chloe left together, hand in hand.



Ava stood in the living room, her hands slowly clenching into fists.



She had only one eighteenth year, and she had given it all to him.



She would not let her youth be buried in a swamp of unrequited love.



She walked out of the house. A light drizzle was falling, and the air was cold.



She remembered how Ethan used to personally pick her up and drop her off on rainy days, holding an umbrella over her. He used to say she was his sheltered port in a storm.



She told herself to get used to walking alone.



She opened her umbrella and walked into the rain.



After getting her visa, she was about to call a cab when she instinctively clicked on Ethan's profile, which she had set as a special notification.



He had just posted a new update.



A rainy day is perfect for an official announcement.



The accompanying photo was a wedding picture of him and Chloe. He was smiling, his eyes full of tenderness.



The comment section was flooded with congratulations.



The left side of her ch\*\*t didn't ache with that familiar pang anymore. It was numb.



She calmly typed a comment.



A match made in heaven.





Chapter 4  No.4

After posting the comment, Ava removed Ethan from her special notifications.



There were still a few days left. She would use that time to completely dig him out of her heart.



When she got home, the house was empty and cold.



She cooked herself a bowl of noodles. As she was eating, she received a message from Chloe.



Ethan and I won't be back tonight.



The message was accompanied by a photo of a candlelit dinner and another of them together in a hotel room.



Ava's fingers trembled. She calmly replied, ""Okay.""



A notification popped up from her high school group chat. They were planning a graduation party.



Considering she would be moving across the country, she decided to go. It would be a final farewell to her classmates.



Someone in the group mentioned Ethan.



I remember when Ava went missing on that school trip, Mr. Hayes flew back from a business trip overseas overnight to lead the search. He's so doting.



The past warmth was now an icicle, making it hurt to breathe.



She simply replied, ""He's not coming.""



They didn't know she had confessed and been rejected. They didn't know he already had someone else.



That night, she sl\*\*t fitfully.



She dreamt of the first time she met Ethan. She was eight years old. He had looked at her with indifference and turned to walk away.



She woke with a start, her face wet with tears.



If he had been that cold from the beginning, would she have recognized the distance between them sooner?



But what was most painful was having received all his affection, only to have it disappear overnight.



She got out of bed and saw the suitcase filled with her memories.



Thirteen days until she left.



She decided to throw it all away, to empty her heart.



She dragged the suitcase downstairs and ran into Ethan and Chloe, who were just coming home.



Ethan frowned. ""Where are you going with that luggage?""



I'm moving into the dorms, she said calmly. ""These are just some useless things I'm throwing away.""



Without another word, Ethan took the suitcase from her and tossed it into the donation pile by the gate. It landed with a loud thud.



Ava's heart sank.



He didn't care at all that the bag was filled with gifts he had given her, with their shared memories.



He turned back, his tone leaving no room for argument. ""There's no need to move into the dorms. I'll talk to your advisor.""



He was already thinking only of Chloe. He didn't care about her future at all.



She went upstairs without a word.



She heard Chloe ask softly, ""Is she angry?""



Ethan's cold reply followed. ""She's an adult now. She needs to learn to be independent.""



Ava paused for a moment on the stairs, then continued walking back to her room.



She was an adult now. She would walk her own path.





Chapter 5  No.5

For the next few days, Ava stayed in her room. Ethan and Chloe were out from morning till night, sometimes not coming home at all.



On Sunday, the tenth day before her departure, she went to the high school reunion.



A classmate handed her a drink. She took it. This was a toast to her youth, a farewell to her classmates.



After one glass, she felt a little dizzy and went to the hallway for some air.



Through the glass wall of a private room, she saw Ethan, surrounded by a group of people.



She forced herself to look away, but she heard someone in the room talking about Ethan's upcoming engagement and what would happen to Ava.



Then, she heard Ethan's familiar, cool voice.



She's an adult now. Her affairs are no longer my concern.



Ava stood by the door, her eyes lowered, and murmured, ""I'm an adult. I'm sensible. From now on, my world won't have you in it either.""



She went to the window to get some air, then to the restroom to splash her face with cold water, trying to clear her head.



When she came out, she ran into a tipsy Ethan. Their eyes met.



Just then, Chloe's sweet voice called out, ""Ethan!"" She threw herself into his arms, complaining that she had had too much to drink.



Ethan ki\*\*ed her forehead dotingly and swept her up into a princess carry, walking away.



Ava stood there for a long time, unmoving.



Why are you crying? her classmate, Summer, asked.



Ava forced a smile. ""An eyelash got in my eye.""



Summer sighed. ""I always thought he would never date anyone, that he would just protect you forever. He used to dote on you so much.""



A bitter taste filled Ava's mouth. ""We both have our own lives to live. We can't be tied together forever.""



What a shame, Summer said. ""I always thought he was your boyfriend. You two looked so good together.""



Ava's heart felt damp. The bonds between people were predestined. She and Ethan would only ever be guardian and ward, nothing more.



When the party ended, she saw Ethan and Chloe waiting for her outside.



It's the middle of the night, and you're still not home. You're getting more and more out of hand, Ethan scolded.



Chloe gently chided him, then smiled at Ava. ""You have him to protect you now, and you'll have a boyfriend to protect you in the future. Let's go home together.""



Ava followed behind them, her eyes lowered. It started to rain again.



Ethan held an umbrella over Chloe, tilting it towards her, his own shirt getting soaked on one side.



Ava remembered how he used to hold the umbrella for her, always tilting it in her direction. He used to say she was a delicately raised rose that couldn't get wet.



Raindrops fell on her white dress, bringing a chill with them.



She came back to her senses and walked into the rain alone.



A rose can't get wet, but she would be her own sunflower, always bright and brilliant.





Chapter 6  No.6

After getting drenched in the rain, Ava felt dizzy when she got home. She took a quick shower and fell into a deep sl\*\*p.



For the next few days, she was the only one in the mansion. She had grown used to it and no longer cared about Ethan's whereabouts.



She received a message from her father with her flight information and the arrangements for him to pick her up.



She checked the calendar. There were only seven days left.



Her departure date was Ethan's birthday.



Leaving was her final gift to him.



A few days later, she packed her remaining belongings and contacted a donation service to pick up the things she couldn't take with her.



Just as the delivery person was taking inventory, Ethan came home.



What are you doing? he asked.



Ava filled out the form, gestured for the delivery person to leave, and calmly explained, ""Just getting rid of some old clothes.""



Ethan frowned. He felt that she had changed a lot. There was a sense of emptiness.



Chloe and I are living in our downtown apartment now. It's quieter there, he informed her.



Ava nodded slightly. Without her, it would indeed be quiet.



She subconsciously asked, ""Can I come to your birthday party? This will be the tenth year.""



Ethan didn't want to talk about it. He pushed his suitcase past her and left, slamming the door behind him.



Ava's heart trembled, and her eyes turned red.



She went back to her room and habitually opened her nightstand drawer to look at the torn painting, but it was empty.



She had thrown it away.



All that was left in the drawer was an old sketchbook.



She took it out. Every page was filled with drawings of Ethan.



She remembered him holding her hand and saying, ""I'll take you home.""



She remembered him putting a gold medal around her neck and saying, ""You are my glory.""



She remembered him giving her a rose and saying, ""I'll wait for you to grow up.""



She would have to scrape those memories from her heart, one by one.



The last page of the sketchbook was blank. She usually drew a picture of them together every year. This year, she decided to draw him and Chloe.



She sketched carefully and meticulously until dusk fell.



The sound of the front door unlocking broke the silence. She saw Ethan stumble in, reeking of al\*\*hol.



Are you okay? she asked, rushing to support him.



Ethan leaned heavily on her, his arm wrapping around her waist.



Then, his scorching lips pressed against hers.





Chapter 7  No.7

Ava's mind went blank.



The scene she had dreamed of countless times was happening for real.



Ethan's rough hand moved to her ch\*\*t. She flinched as if electrocuted, struggling to push him away.



Ethan! she cried out, but his ca\*\*ss only grew more insistent.



Chloe, be good, he murmured, his voice thick with desire. The words were like a thunderclap in her ears.



He was mistaking her for Chloe.



He carried her into her room and pushed her onto the bed. The shock brought her back to her senses.



I'm Ava! she screamed, her voice raw with anguish. ""I'm not Chloe!""



Ethan froze. He looked at her with dr\*\*ken eyes, then pulled her into his arms, holding her tight, but made no further moves.



She tried to get up, but his hoarse voice stopped her. ""Don't go.""



Was he asking her to stay, or the woman he thought she was?



He closed his eyes and fell asleep. She felt powerless, unable to escape the prison of his arms.



Her head throbbed, and exhaustion finally claimed her.



The next morning, she opened her eyes to see Ethan standing by the bed, looking down at her with an unreadable expression.



Why are you in my bed? he demanded.



Ava's face flushed red. She wanted to explain, but he cut her off.



I don't care what you were thinking, he spat, his voice laced with disappointment and disgust. ""If this happens again, you can pack your bags and move to the dorms for good.""



She swallowed all her explanations and simply apologized. Even if she told him the truth, he wouldn't believe her.



Five more days. Then she would be in New York, and she would disappear from his world forever.



She got up and pulled her disheveled clothes tightly around her as she walked out of the room.



Just as she opened the door, she ran into Chloe coming up the stairs.



Chloe's eyes widened in shock. ""Why are you coming out of Ethan's room?""



Ava's face turned pale. She avoided Chloe's gaze and fled back to her own room.



Chloe followed her in, her eyes sharp and scrutinizing. ""What did you do with Ethan?""



She accused her, ""You shameless bi\*\*h. You climbed into his bed while he was drunk.""



Ava's head was bowed. Any explanation felt feeble.



Don't even try to deny it, Chloe snapped. ""We had a fight, and you saw your chance, didn't you?""



She warned her, ""If you ever do something so disgusting again, I'll make sure you get kicked out of this house forever."" She slammed the door and left.



Ava slid down the wall, all the strength drained from her body.



Ethan's accusations and Chloe's warnings felt like an invisible hand, squeezing her heart.



Fat tears rolled down her cheeks. The emotions she had suppressed for so long finally broke. She covered her mouth and sobbed.





Chapter 8  No.8

After some time, she heard the roar of a car engine outside. Ethan and Chloe were gone.



Ava calmly got up and curled up on her bed, hugging herself tightly.



The next morning, she received a call from her mother. After a moment's hesitation, she answered.



Her mother's furious voice erupted from the phone. ""You've really brought shame upon us! Climbing into your guardian's b\* d! Do you have no decency?""



A deep sense of sorrow washed over Ava. After her parents' divorce, her mother had remarried and always called her a burden.



She rarely cared about her. The only two times she had actively shown ""concern"" were to berate her. Once for her confession, and now for this.



Why? Ava asked, her voice trembling. ""Why do you just assume it was me?""



Her mother was silent for a moment, then replied with disgust, ""If you jeopardize my position in the Hayes family, you can just go find your father.""



The line went dead. Ava stared at the black screen, her expression vacant.



She bit her lip hard, refusing to let the tears fall.



The daughter her mother despised would be leaving the Hayes family in four days.



For the next few days, Ethan didn't come home. Ava was busy with her preparations for going abroad and paid them no mind.



The minute before Ethan's birthday, she opened her messaging app and clicked on his contact, which was pinned to the top. She stared at it for a long time, then closed the window.



This was the first time in ten years she hadn't wished him a happy birthday.



The next morning, she received a flight reminder. Twelve hours until departure.



She opened her social media and saw Chloe's new post. It was a picture of her and Ethan holding hands on a beach lined with roses.



Then, she received a message from Chloe.



Ethan wants to spend his birthday with just me. I hope you won't disturb us.



It was accompanied by a short video. Ethan was lying on a waterbed in a bathrobe. Chloe's shoulders were covered in tell-tale red marks.



Ava's lips curved into a wry smile. She silently closed the app and began to clear out everything that belonged to her.



Four hours until departure. She took out her sketchbook and tore up every drawing of him.



Three hours until departure. She threw away every last thing in the house that was hers.



Two hours until departure. She placed the chinchilla night lamp on the coffee table in the living room, right on top of a framed photo of Ethan and Chloe.



When she was eight, he had been her light. From now on, she would be her own light. Her own sunflower.



One hour until departure. On the back of the painting she had made of him and Chloe, she wrote a message.



Happy Birthday. And goodbye. I wish you a happy life—one that no longer includes me.



She deleted Ethan and Chloe's contacts, deactivated her accounts, and factory reset her phone.



She took one last look at the home she had lived in for ten years and headed straight for the airport.



As the plane took off, the starry sky illuminated the city lights below, and also the path ahead of her.



She would never look back.

  “Just be yourself,"" my mother said, as if that were easy. Which it isn't. Ever. Especially not when you're fifteen and don't know what language you're going to have to speak at lunch, or what name you'll have to use the next time you do a ""project"" for extra credit. Not when your nickname is ""the Chameleon. ""  
  
  Not when you go to a school for spies.  
  
  Of course, if you're reading this, you probably have at least a Level Four clearance and know all about the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women—that it isn't really a boarding school for privileged girls, and that, despite our gorgeous mansion and manicured grounds, we're not snobs. We're spies. But on that January day, even my mother…even my headmistress…seemed to have forgotten that when you've spent your whole life learning fourteen different languages and how to completely alter your appearance using nothing but nail clippers and shoe polish, then being yourself gets a little harder—that we Gallagher Girls are really far better at being someone else.  
  
  (And we've got the fake IDs to prove it. )  
  
  My mother slipped her arm around me and whispered, ""It's going to be okay, kiddo,"" as she guided me through the crowds of shoppers that filled Pentagon City Mall. Security cameras tracked our every move, but still my mother said, ""It's fine. It's protocol. It's normal. ""  
  
  But ever since I was four years old and inadvertently cracked a Sapphire Series NSA code my dad had brought home after a mission to Singapore, it had been pretty obvious that the term normal would probably never apply to me.  
  
  After all, normal girls probably love going to the mall with their pockets full of Christmas money. Normal girls don't get summoned to D. C. on the last day of winter break. And normal girls very rarely feel like hyperventilating when their mothers pull a pair of jeans off a rack and tell a saleslady, ""Excuse me, my daughter would like to try these on. ""  
  
  I felt anything but normal as the saleslady searched my eyes for some hidden clue. ""Have you tried the ones from Milan?"" she asked. ""I hear the European styles are very flattering. ""  
  
  Beside me, my mother fingered the soft denim. ""Yes, I used to have a pair like this, but they got ruined at the cleaners. ""  
  
  And then the saleslady pointed down a narrow hallway. A hint of a smile was on her face. ""I believe dressing room number seven is available. "" She started to walk away, then turned back to me and whispered, ""Good luck. ""  
  
  And I totally knew I was going to need it.  
  
  We walked together down the narrow hall, and once we were inside the dressing room my mother closed the door. Our eyes met in the mirror, and she said, ""Are you ready?""  
  
  And then I did the thing we Gallagher Girls are best at—I lied. ""Sure. ""  
  
  We pressed our palms against the cool, smooth mirror and felt the glass grow warm beneath our skin.  
  
  ""You're going to do great,"" Mom said, as if being myself wouldn't be so hard or so terrible. As if I hadn't spent my entire life wanting to be her.  
  
  And then the ground beneath us started to shake.  
  
  The walls rose as the floor sank. Bright lights flashed white, burning my eyes. I reached dizzily for my mother's arm.  
  
  ""Just a body scan,"" she said reassuringly, and the elevator continued its descent farther and farther beneath the city. A wave of hot air blasted my face like the world's biggest hair dryer. ""Biohazard detectors,"" Mom explained as we continued our smooth, quick ride.  
  
  Time seemed to stand still, but I knew to count the seconds. One minute. Two minutes…  
  
  ""Almost there,"" Mom said. We descended through a thin laser beam that read our retinal images. Moments later, a bright orange light pulsed, and I felt the elevator stop. The doors slid open.  
  
  And then my mouth went slack.  
  
  Tiles made of black granite and white marble stretched across the floor of the cavernous space like a life-size chessboard. Twin staircases twisted from opposite corners of the massive room, spiraling forty feet to the second story, framing a granite wall that bore the silver seal of the CIA and the motto I know by heart:  
  
  And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.  
  
  As I stepped forward I saw elevators—dozens of them— lining the wall that curved behind us. Stainless steel letters above the elevator from which we'd just emerged spelled out WOMEN'S WEAR, MALL. To the right, another was labeled men's room, roslyn metro station.  
  
  A screen on top of the elevator flashed our names. RACHEL MORGAN, DEPARTMENT OF OPERATIVE DEVELOPMENT. I glanced at Mom as the screen changed. CAMERON MORGAN, TEMPORARY GUEST.  
  
  There was a loud ding, and soon DAVID DUNCAN, IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS REMOVAL DIVISION was emerging from the elevator labeled SAINT SEBASTIAN CONFESSIONAL, at which point I totally started freaking out—but not in the Oh-my-gosh-I'm-in-a-top-secret-facility-that's-three-times-more-secure-than-the-White-House sense. No, my freak-outedness was purely of the This-is-the-coolest-thing-that's-ever-happened-to-me sense, because, despite three and a half years of training, I'd temporarily forgotten why we were here.  
  
  ""Come on, sweetie,"" Mom said, taking my hand and pulling me through the atrium, where people climbed purposefully up the spiraling stairs. They carried newspapers and chatted over cups of coffee. It was almost…normal. But then Mom approached a guard who was missing half his nose and one ear, and I thought about how when you're a Gallagher Girl, normal is a completely relative thing.  
  
  ""Welcome, ladies,"" the guard said. ""Place your palms here. "" He indicated the smooth counter in front of him, and as soon as we touched the surface I felt the heat of the scanner that was memorizing my prints. A mechanical printer sprang to life somewhere, and the guard leaned down to retrieve two badges.  
  
  ""Well, Rachel Morgan,"" he said, looking at my mother as if she hadn't been standing right in front of him for a full minute, ""welcome back! And this must be little…"" The man squinted, trying to read the badge in his hand.  
  
  ""This is my daughter, Cameron. ""  
  
  ""Of course she is! She looks just like you. "" Which just proved that whatever terrible nose incident he'd experienced had no doubt affected his eyes, too, because while Rachel Morgan has frequently been described as beautiful, I am usually described as nondescript. ""Strap this on, young lady,"" the guard said, handing me the ID badge. ""And don't lose it—it's loaded with a tracking chip and a half milligram of C-4. If you try to remove it or enter an unauthorized area, it'll detonate. "" He stared at me. ""And then you'll die. ""  
  
  I swallowed hard, then suddenly understood why take-your-daughter-to-work day was never really an option in the Morgan family.  
  
  ""Okay,"" I muttered, taking the badge gingerly. Then the man slapped the counter, and—spy training or not—I jumped.  
  
  ""Ha!"" The guard let out a sharp laugh and leaned closer to my mother. ""The Gallagher Academy is growing them more gullible than it did in my day, Rachel,"" he teased, then winked at me. ""Spy humor. ""  
  
  Well, personally, I didn't think his ""humor"" was all that funny, but my mother smiled and took my arm again. ""Come on, kiddo, you don't want to be late. ""  
  
  She led me down a sunny corridor that made it almost impossible to believe we were underground. Bright, cool light splashed the gray walls and reminded me of Sublevel One at school…which reminded me of my Covert Operations class…which reminded me of finals week…which reminded me of …  
  
  Josh.  
  
  We passed the Office of Guerrilla Warfare but didn't slow down. Two women waved to my mother outside the Department of Cover and Concealment, but we didn't stop to chat.  
  
  We walked faster, going deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of secrets, until the corridor branched and we could either go left, toward the Department of Sabotage and Seemingly Accidental Explosions, or  
right, to the Office of Operative Development and Human Intelligence. And despite the FLAME-RESISTANT BODYSUITS MANDATORY BEYOND THIS POINT sign marking the hallway to my left, I'd much rather have gone in that direction. Or just back to the mall. Anywhere but where I knew I had to go.  
  
  Because even though the truth can set you free, that doesn't mean it won't be painful.  
  
  ""My name is Cammie. ""  
  
  ""No, what's your full name?"" asked the man in front of the polygraph machine, as if I weren't wearing the aforementioned (and supposedly nonexplosive) name badge.  
  
  I thought about my mother's words of wisdom and took a deep breath. ""Cameron Ann Morgan. ""  
  
  The room around me was completely bare, except for a stainless steel table, two chairs, and a mirror made of one-way glass. I probably wasn't the first Gallagher Girl to sit in that sterile room—after all, debriefs are a part of the covert operations package. Still, I couldn't help squirming in the hard metal chair—maybe because it was cold in there, maybe because I was nervous, maybe because I was experiencing a slight underwear situation. (Note to self: develop a wedgie theory of interrogation—there could totally be something to it!) But the efficient-looking man in the wire-rim glasses was too busy twisting knobs and punching keys, trying to figure out what the truth sounded like coming from me, to care about my fidgeting.  
  
  ""The Gallagher Academy doesn't teach interrogation procedures until we're juniors, you know?"" I said, but the man just muttered, ""Uh-huh. ""  
  
  ""And I'm just a sophomore, so you shouldn't worry about the results coming out all screwy or anything. I'm not immune to your powers of interrogation. "" Yet.  
  
  ""Good to know,"" he mumbled, but his eyes never left the screens.  
  
  ""I know it's just standard protocol, so just…ask away. "" I was babbling, but couldn't seem to stop. ""Really,"" I said. ""Whatever you need to know, just—""  
  
  ""Do you attend the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women?"" the man blurted, and for reasons I will never understand I said, ""Uh…yes?"" as if it might be a trick question.  
  
  ""Have you ever studied the subject of Covert Operations?""  
  
  ""Yes,"" I said again, feeling my confidence, or maybe just my training, coming back to me.  
  
  ""Did your Covert Operations coursework ever take you to the town of Roseville, Virginia?""  
  
  Even in that sterile room beneath Washington, D. C. , I could almost feel the hot, humid night last September. I could almost hear the band and smell the corn dogs.  
  
  My stomach growled as I said, ""Yes. ""  
  
  Polygraph Guy made notes and studied the bank of monitors that surrounded him. ""Is that when you first noticed The Subject?""  
  
  Here's the thing about being a spy in love: your boyfriend never has a name. People like Polygraph Guy were never just going to call him josh. He would always be The Subject, a person of interest. Taking away his name was their way of taking him away, or what was left of him. So I said, ""Yes,"" and tried not to let my voice crack.  
  
  ""And you utilized your training to develop a relationship with The Subject?""  
  
  ""Gee, when you say it like that—""  
  
  ""Yes or no, Ms. —""  
  
  ""Yes!""  
  
  Which, I would like to point out, is not nearly as bad as it sounds since, for example, you don't need a search warrant to go through someone's trash. Seriously. Once it hits the curb it is totally fair game—you can look it up.

 But somehow I knew that the Office of Operative Development and Human Intelligence was probably far less concerned about the trash thing than it was about what came after the trash thing. So I was fully prepared when Polygraph Guy said, ""Did The Subject follow you during your Covert Operations final examination?""  
  
  I thought about Josh appearing in the abandoned warehouse during finals week, bursting through walls and commandeering a forklift to ""save"" me, so I swallowed hard as I said, ""Yes. ""  
  
  ""And was The Subject given memory-modification tea to erase the events of that night?""  
  
  It sounded so easy coming from him, so black-and-white. Sure, my mom gave Josh some tea thats supposed to wipe a persons memory blank, erase a few hours of their life, and give everyone a clean slate. But clean slates are a rare thing in any life—especially a spys life—so I didnt let myself wonder for the millionth time what Josh remembered about that night, about me. I didnt torture myself with any of the questions that might never have answers as I sat there, knowing that there is no such thing as black-and-white—remembering that my whole life is, by definition, a little bit gray.  
  
  I nodded, then muttered, ""Yes. "" Like it or not, I knew I had to say the word out loud.  
  
  He made some more notes, punched some keys. ""Are you currently involved with The Subject in any way?""  
  
  ""No,"" I blurted, because I knew that much was true. I hadnt seen Josh, hadnt spoken to him, hadnt even hacked into his e-mail account over winter break, which, given present circumstances, turned out to be a pretty good thing. (Plus, I had spent the last two weeks in Nebraska with Grandpa and Grandma Morgan, and they have dial-up, which takes forever!)  
  
  Then the man in the wire-rim glasses looked away from the screen and straight into my eyes. ""And do you intend to reinitiate contact with The Subject despite strict rules prohibiting such a relationship?""  
  
  There it was: the question Id pondered for weeks.  
  
  There I was: Cammie the Chameleon—the Gallagher Girl who had risked the most sacred sisterhood in the history of espionage. For a boy.  
  
  ""Ms. Morgan,"" Polygraph Guy said, growing impatient, ""are you going to reinitiate contact with The Subject?""  
  
  ""No,"" I said softly.  
  
  Then I glanced back at the screen to see if I was lying.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  If youve ever been debriefed by the CIA, then you probably know exactly how I felt two hours later as I sat in the backseat of a limousine, watching city give way to suburbs and suburbs to countryside. Dirty piles of blackened ice became thick blankets of lush white snow, and the world seemed clean and new—ready for a fresh start.  
  
  I was through with lying (except for official cover stories, of course). And sneaking around (well…except when involved in covert operations). I was going to be normal! (Or as normal as a student at spy school ever gets a chance to be. )  
  
  I was going to be … myself.  
  
  I looked at my mother and reiterated the promise that I would never let a boy come between me and my family or my friends or matters of national security ever again. Then I realized that shed hardly said a word since wed left D. C. ""I did okay, didnt I?"" I asked, almost afraid to hear the answer.  
  
  ""Of course, sweetie. You aced it. ""  
  
  Which, not to sound conceited or anything, I kind of already knew, because A) Ive always tested well, and B) people who fail polygraphs dont usually walk out of top-secret facilities and get driven back to spy school.  
  
  Then I thought about the one-way glass. ""You got to watch, didnt you?"" I asked, fully expecting her to say, You were great, sweetie, or I think this might be worth some extra credit, or Remember, breathing is key when youre being interrogated with a TruthMaster 3000. But no. She didnt say any of those things.  
  
  Instead, my mother just placed her hand over mine and said, ""No, Cam. Im afraid I had some things to do. ""  
  
  Things? My mother had missed my first official government interrogation because of … things?  
  
  I might have asked for details, begged her to explain how she could miss such a milestone in a young spys life, but I know the things my mother does typically involve national security, fake passports, and the occasional batch of weapons-grade plutonium, so I said, ""Oh. Okay,"" knowing I shouldnt feel hurt, but feeling it anyway.  
  
  We sat in silence until there was nothing to see outside my window but the tall stone fences that circle the Gallagher Academy grounds. Home.  
  
  I felt the limo slow and stop behind the long line of nearly identical chauffeured cars that brought us back to school each semester. It had been more than a century since Gillian Gallagher had decided to turn her familys mansion into an elite boarding school, and even then, after more than a hundred years of educating exceptional young women, no one in the town of Roseville, Virginia, had a clue just how exceptional we really were. Not even my ex-boyfriend.  
  
  ""Tell me everything!"" someone cried as soon as I opened the limo door. Sunlight bounced off the snow, blinding me before I could focus on my best friends face. Bexs caramel-colored eyes bore into me, her brown skin glowed, and, as usual, she looked like an Egyptian goddess. ""Was it awesome?""  
  
  She stepped aside as I crawled out of the car, but didnt pause because…well…Bex doesnt exactly have a pause. She has a play and a fast-forward and occasionally a rewind, but Rebecca Baxter didnt become the first non-American Gallagher Girl in history by standing still.  
  
  ""Did they grill you?"" she continued. Then her eyes went wide and her accent grew heavy. ""Was there torture?""  
  
  Well, of course there wasnt torture; but before I could say so, Bex exclaimed, ""I bet it was bloody brilliant!"" Most little girls in England grow up wanting to marry a prince. Bex grew up wanting to kick James Bonds butt and assume his double-0 ranking.  
  
  My mom walked around the side of the car. ""Good afternoon, Rebecca. I trust you made it back from the airport okay?"" And then, despite the bright sun that glowed around us, a shadow seemed to cross my best friends face.  
  
  ""Yes, maam. "" She pulled one of my bags from the open trunk. ""Thanks again for letting me spend winter break with you. "" Most people wouldnt have noticed the slight change in her voice, the faint vulnerability of her smile. But I understand what its like not to know what continent your parents are on, or when youll see them again. If ever. My mother was standing right beside me, but all Bex had was a coded message saying her parents were representing Englands MI6 in a joint project with the CIA, and that, like it or not, they couldnt exactly come home for Christmas.  
  
  When Mom hugged Bex and whispered, ""Youre always welcome with us, sweetheart,"" I couldnt help thinking about how Bex had both of her parents some of the time, and I had one of my parents most of the time, but right then, neither of us seemed entirely happy with the deal.  
  
  We stood in silence for a minute, watching my mother walk away. I could have asked Bex about her parents. She could have mentioned my dad. But instead I just turned to her and said, ""I got to meet the woman who bugged the Berlin Embassy in 1962. ""  
  
  And that was all it took to make my best friend smile.  
  
  We started for the main doors, pushing through the crowded foyer and up the Grand Staircase. We were halfway to our rooms when someone … or rather, something…stopped us in our tracks.  
  
  ""Ladies,"" Patricia Buckingham called as I reached for the door to the East Wing—and the fastest route to our rooms. I tried the knob, but it wouldnt budge.  
  
  ""Its …"" I twisted harder. ""…stuck!""  
  
  ""Its not stuck, ladies,"" Buckingham called again, her genteel British accent carrying above the noise in the foyer below. ""Its locked,"" she said, as if we have locked doors all the time at the Gallagher Academy, which, let me tell you— we dont. I mean, sure, a lot of our doors are protected by NSA-approved codes or retinal scanners, but theyre never just…locked. (Because, really, whats the point when there are entire sections of our library labeled Locks: The Manipulation and Disabling of?)  
  
  ""Im afraid the security department spent the winter break fixing a series of … s  
hall we say … gaps in the security system. "" Professor Buckingham eyed me over the top of her reading glasses, and I felt a guilty lump settle in my gut. ""And they discovered that the wing had been contaminated with fumes from the chemistry labs. Therefore, this corridor is off-limits for the time being; youre going to have to find another way to your rooms. ""  
  
  Well, after three and a half years of exploring every inch of the Gallagher mansion, I knew better than anyone that there are other ways to our rooms (some of which require closed-toe shoes, a Phillips-head screwdriver, and fifty yards of rappel-a-cord). But before I could mention any of them, Buckingham turned back to us and said, ""Oh, and Cameron, dear, please make sure your alternate route doesnt involve crawling inside any walls. ""  
  
  This whole fresh-start thing was going to be harder than I thought.  
  
  Bex and I started toward the back stairs, where Courtney Bauer was modeling the boots shed gotten for Hanukkah. When we passed the sophomore common room we saw Kim Lee showing off the derivation of the Proadsky Position shed mastered over break. We saw girls of every size, shape, and color, and I felt more and more at home with every step. Finally, I pushed open the door to our suite and was halfway through the throw-your-suitcase-onto-the-bed maneuver when someone grabbed me from behind.  
  
  ""Oh my gosh!"" Liz cried. ""Ive been so worried!""  
  
  My suitcase landed hard on my foot, but I couldnt really cry out in pain because Liz was still squeezing, and even though she weighs less than a hundred pounds, Liz can squeeze pretty hard when she wants to.  
  
  ""Bex said you had to go in for questioning,"" Liz said. ""She said it was Top Secret!""  
  
  Yeah. Pretty much everything we do is Top Secret, but the novelty has never worn off for Liz, probably because, unlike Bex and me and seventy percent of our classmates, Lizs parents drive Volvos and serve on PTA committees and have never had to kill a man with a copy of People magazine. (Not that anyone can prove my mom actually did that—its totally just a rumor. )  
  
  ""Liz, its okay,"" I said, pulling free, ""It was just a debrief. It was normal protocol stuff. ""  
  
  ""So…"" Liz started. ""You arent in trouble?"" She picked up a massive book. ""Because article nine, section seven of the Handbook of Operative Development clearly states that operatives in training may be placed on temporary—""  
  
  ""Liz,"" Bex said, cutting her off, ""please tell me you didnt spend the morning memorizing that book. ""  
  
  ""I didnt memorize it,"" Liz said defensively. ""I just…read it. "" Which, when you have a photographic memory, is pretty much the same thing, but I didnt say so.  
  
  Down the hall, I heard Eva Alvarez explaining how Buenos Aires on New Years Eve is awesome. A pair of freshmen rushed by our door talking about who would make a better Gallagher Girl: Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Veronica Mars (a debate made much more interesting by the fact it was taking place in Farsi).  
  
  Bright sunlight shone through our window, bouncing off the snow. It was a new semester and my best friends were beside me. All seemed right with the world.

1moiz38,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1moiz38/i_am_so_lost/,I am so lost,"So I’ve recently had the weirdest yet most beautiful chain of events happen to me, and I still don’t quite know how to process it.

I (22F) went to do a summer internship in a different city. At the time, I was dating a guy from college, and we had to do long distance for three months with a 12-hour time difference. Our relationship had been great—we’d been together for a year and a half, and I never doubted his love. Before I left, we were already looking forward to seeing each other when school started again. However, over time I noticed we were growing distant. I confronted him about it, and he admitted that long-distance relationships just weren’t for him. Long story short, after numerous attempts to fix things and ask him to find a solution, I decided to end it because it was causing me too much emotional distress. Now here’s where it gets weird. A week before the breakup, I attended a meeting with another cohort of interns from a different company and saw a guy who was, honestly, very attractive. I didn’t act on it because I was still in a relationship, just added him on LinkedIn and thought nothing more of it. Two days after the breakup, I randomly decided to message him to ask if he wanted to grab coffee, partly to get my mind off the breakup and also because I figured it couldn’t hurt to develop a new connection. We met up, and to my surprise, ended up spending half the day together. The conversation flowed so naturally, it felt like I’d known him forever. By the end of the day, he asked if I wanted to join him on a little day retreat. I said yes, and the next day we went on an adventure together talking, laughing, and having fun nonstop. We never ran out of things to say, and it honestly felt like meeting the male version of myself. We even talked about it and realized the feelings were mutual. The sad part was that this all happened just a week before I had to go home. I asked him what was going to happen, and we both admitted we didn’t know as starting a relationship after only a week and immediately doing long distance didn’t feel right, especially for me since I’d just ended one. So we agreed to stay friends for now, keep in contact as much as possible, and see if we could build on this connection over time. That week, we spent every moment we could together, traveling, going on dates, and having open, candid conversations that felt like home. Then came the day of my departure. We were both sad, and he came to the airport with me to say goodbye. It’s been a week since then, and we still talk every day. I do eventually want a relationship with him, but I’m scared that with such a small foundation, the distance will hurt our connection. To make things worse, he’s starting at a new school while I finish my senior year, so seeing each other during the academic year will be challenging. Still, we agreed to plan as best we can to see each other. Has anyone else experienced something like this? Do you have advice on how to nurture this connection and eventually make it work?",2,1755028219.0,LongDistance,0,1.0,False

1moixve,https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYfragrance/comments/1moixve/a_new_adventure/,A New Adventure,"Hi everyone,

I’m new to perfumery and I’ve recently started diving into it with the goal of taking it seriously and eventually turning it into a business. I know this is an expensive hobby, but I already run two profitable businesses and I want to do this full time in the future. For now, it’s a long-term passion project with the goal of eventually getting me out of the service industry.

I have a small list of ingredients already, but I want to start purchasing more and want to make sure I’m choosing the right ones so I can create complex, high quality blends that feel like luxury colognes and perfumes.

I’m hoping to get advice on must-have ingredients to add next, where to buy quality materials without wasting money, good books, websites, or courses that teach genuine in-depth techniques, how to put together a solid marketing plan so I can create a brand, and how others here are selling their products and what kind of price points they use.

If anyone experienced is open to it, I’d even love to hop on a quick call or Zoom to get some guidance and make sure I’m on the right track from the start.

Really appreciate any advice you can share. I want to do this the right way and avoid bad habits early on.

Thanks,  
Anthony

That's what Agent Christian told me. My life as an FBI agent was about to end, replaced by a ghost. No contact with my past, not even my husband, Darwin.

But then, a week before my staged death, I walked into our home office and saw it: Darwin's laptop, open, displaying a live video feed. My husband, shirtless, with his assistant, Elyssa Daniel. They were k1ssing. My world tilted.

I watched, frozen, as he k1ssed her. The sounds they made were obscene. I recognized the unique lines of his body, the watch I gave him for our anniversary. I stumbled back, my hand shaking as I reached for my phone. I had to confront this nightmare.

I hit the call button. On the screen, Darwin froze, then answered my call. ""Hey, honey. What's up?"" His voice, so normal, so full of lies, broke something inside me. The phone slipped from my grasp. My heart, my love, my entire world had been a lie.

I spent the night on the office floor, replaying the video. The evidence of his betrayal was a digital tombstone for our marriage. Each time I watched, disgust and pain grew. I looked at my wedding ring, a mark of my foolishness, and threw it across the room.

He thought I was weak, predictable. He thought I loved him so much I'd believe the sky was green. But the woman who loved Darwin Mcintosh died on that office floor. And in that moment, my mission, my fake death, felt like an escape.



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""You will be declared dead, Gregoria.""

Agent Christian' s voice was flat, leaving no room for emotion in the sterile briefing room.

""An accidental death. Tragic, unavoidable. Your life, as you know it, will end. No contact with anyone from your past. Not your friends, not your family. Not your husband.""

The name hung in the air: Darwin. My husband. The man I loved more than my own life, a life I was now being asked to give up.

""I understand the risks, sir,"" I said, my voice steady. I was a professional. I was an FBI agent. This was the job.

But my hands, hidden under the table, were clenched into fists.

Christian nodded, his eyes showing a flicker of something-pity, maybe. He had been my mentor, the one who saw potential in a rookie agent and shaped me. He knew what he was asking. ""This organization is dangerous. They have moles everywhere. To get inside, you have to be a ghost. Gregoria Ellis has to cease to exist.""

""I'm ready,"" I said, and the words felt true. For the mission, I was ready. For my country, I was ready. But saying goodbye to Darwin... that was a different kind of sacrifice. A goodbye he would never even know was happening.

I would just... disappear from his life. He would mourn a wife who was still alive, living a new life under a new name, in a world of shadows he could never imagine.

The thought was a heavy weight in my chest.

After the briefing, I left the FBI building, a sense of finality washing over me. In one week, I would be dead. A strange feeling of relief settled in. The decision was made. The path was set. Now, all that was left was to walk it.

As I drove, my phone buzzed with a news alert. A picture of Darwin filled the small screen. He was smiling his charismatic smile, accepting an award for ""Entrepreneur of the Year."" The headline praised him as a philanthropic genius, a devoted husband, a pillar of the community.

Comments flooded the article.

""What a man! And so handsome.""

""His wife is the luckiest woman alive.""

""I wish I had a husband like Darwin Mcintosh.""

A bitter taste filled my mouth. The luckiest woman alive. If only they knew what this lucky woman was about to do, the life she was about to abandon. The love she was about to betray, for the greater good.

My heart ached. I wanted to call him, to hear his voice one last time before I went dark. But I couldn't. Not yet.

My mind drifted back to the week before. I had come home early, planning a surprise dinner. I walked into our home office to grab a file and saw his laptop was open, the screen active.

He must have forgotten to close it.

I moved to shut it, but something on the screen caught my eye. It was a live video feed. A woman was laughing, her head thrown back.

Then a man entered the frame. Darwin. He was shirtless. His back was to the camera, but I knew every line of it. I knew the small, crescent-shaped scar on his left shoulder blade from a childhood fall.

He wrapped his arms around the woman, pulling her close. Her name was Elyssa Daniel. His assistant.

The world tilted. My breath caught in my throat. I watched, frozen, as he k1ssed her. The sounds they made were obscene, a violation of everything I thought we had.

My hand flew to my mouth to stifle a cry.

I recognized the unique lines of his body, the way he moved. It was him. Unquestionably him. The watch on his wrist was the one I gave him for our anniversary.

I stumbled back, my hand shaking as I reached for my phone. I had to call him. I had to confront this nightmare.

My finger hovered over his contact photo-a picture of us on our wedding day, smiling.

I hit the call button.

As the phone in my hand started to ring, the Darwin on the screen froze. He reached into his pocket, pulling out his own phone. The live feed abruptly cut to black.

A moment later, he answered my call. ""Hey, honey. What's up?"" His voice was casual, laced with the warmth I loved.

The sound of it, so normal, so full of lies, broke something inside me.

The phone slipped from my grasp and clattered onto the floor. I couldn't breathe. My heart, my love, my entire world had been a lie.

I spent the rest of the night on the floor of the office, replaying the video over and over. I had instinctively hit record the moment I realized what I was seeing. The evidence of his betrayal was now a file on my phone, a small, digital tombstone for our marriage.

Each time I watched it, the disgust and pain grew, a poison spreading through my veins.

I looked at my wedding ring, the simple gold band he had placed on my finger. It felt like a brand, a mark of my foolishness. I twisted it off and threw it across the room. It hit the wall with a small, pathetic clink.

I remembered a conversation from years ago. A friend of his had cheated on his wife. Darwin had been furious.

""I would never,"" he had sworn to me, his eyes sincere. ""If I ever broke your trust, Gregoria, I'd deserve the worst this world has to offer.""

And I had believed him. I, a trained FBI agent, an expert in deception, had been blind to the biggest lie of all.

When I finally dragged myself out of the office, the sun was rising. I found him in the kitchen, humming as he made breakfast. The smell of coffee and pancakes, once a comfort, now made me sick.

""Morning, beautiful,"" he said, turning to me with that same perfect smile. He pulled me into a hug, his arms strong and familiar.

It felt like being embraced by a stranger.

My body went rigid. I wanted to scream, to claw at him, to show him the video and watch his perfect mask crumble.

But the mission. Agent Christian's words echoed in my head. Gregoria Ellis has to cease to exist.

And in that moment, I realized she already had. The woman who loved Darwin Mcintosh died on the office floor last night.

""I made your favorite,"" he said, gesturing to a plate of chocolate chip pancakes.

""I hate chocolate chips in my pancakes,"" I said, my voice dead.

He froze, his smile faltering for a second. ""You do?"" He forced a laugh. ""Right, of course. I forgot. I must have been thinking of Elyssa, she loves them.""

He said her name so easily. The name of the woman he was sleeping with. He didn't even realize his mistake.

A cold, heavy calm settled over me. He didn't know me. Maybe he never had.

""It doesn't matter,"" I said, turning away from him. ""I'm not hungry.""

I needed to get out of there. I needed to breathe air that wasn't thick with his lies.

""Are you okay, Gregoria?"" he asked, his voice laced with manufactured concern. ""You seem... distant.""

I looked at him, at the handsome face I once adored, and felt nothing but a vast, empty coldness.

""Just tired,"" I lied. ""Long week.""

He wrapped his arms around me from behind, resting his chin on my shoulder. ""Don't worry,"" he whispered into my ear. ""The weekend is almost here. Just you and me. I promise.""

A promise. From him, the word was a joke.

In one week, I would be dead. And he would be free to be with her. The thought should have destroyed me.

Instead, it felt like the beginning of my own freedom.

I didn’t think I’d be back here this soon but it’s been one of the weirdest, messiest weeks of my life and I can’t stop thinking about it. I can’t even tell this to my friends because they’d either judge me or tell everyone else, and I don’t want this getting out in my town.

So quick recap if you don’t want to scroll to my last post: I (20F) was dating Alex (26M) for about two months. He was sweet, attentive, all the cliché stuff — remembered my favorite tea, would rub my shoulders when I was stressed, etc. I introduced him to my mom (45F) who, for context, is gorgeous, dresses like she’s still in her 30s, and loves being the center of attention. Long story short, over time I noticed them getting… weird. Too much eye contact, her “accidentally” wearing short skirts when he was around, him suddenly being less affectionate with me. It all ended with a party where she said she didn’t feel well, Alex offered to drive her home, and they just didn’t come back for hours.

Okay. That’s where we left off.

So after that night, I didn’t break up with Alex in some dramatic way. I just… stopped. Stopped replying right away. Stopped asking to meet. I wasn’t ready to scream at him or demand answers, because I was still in that frozen stage where your brain is just trying to process the betrayal. But I was angry. Like, deep in my stomach, can’t-sleep angry.

A few days later, I was scrolling on Facebook (yes, I still use it sometimes, mostly for stalking) and I ended up on Alex’s mom’s birthday photos. And that’s when I saw him — his dad.

Here’s the thing: I had met his dad once before, super briefly, when Alex was picking me up and his dad was leaving for work. Tall. Salt-and-pepper hair. Strong jawline. That kind of subtle aftershave smell you notice for hours afterward. He said like three words to me that day and I still remembered how… grounded he felt.

Anyway, in one of those Facebook photos, he was standing off to the side holding a drink, smiling at someone. And something in me just clicked. I can’t explain it. Was it petty? 100%. Was it about revenge? Also 100%.

I found his profile (took me less than five minutes — people really don’t know how to set privacy settings) and sent a simple DM: “Hey, long time no see. Hope you’re doing well.” I almost deleted it right after because I felt insane. But then he replied. In like ten minutes.

We had a little small talk. He asked how I was, mentioned that he’d heard “things have been complicated” between me and Alex (!!! so clearly Alex has been talking to him). Then he said something like, “We should catch up properly sometime, maybe over coffee.”

I sat on that message for a day. I thought about all the times I’d walked into the kitchen and seen my mom touching Alex’s arm. All the times Alex had looked at her like she was the only person in the room. And suddenly the idea didn’t feel so crazy anymore.

So I said yes.

We met at this little coffee shop downtown. I was so nervous I actually showed up twenty minutes early and just sat in my car with my music playing, trying to calm down. When he walked in, I swear I felt every head turn toward him. He was wearing a dark blue button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled just enough to see his forearms, and he smiled when he saw me — really smiled, like he was actually happy I was there.

We talked for over two hours. He asked about my work, my hobbies, even about my favorite places in town. He’s one of those people who makes you feel like what you’re saying actually matters. I noticed little things — the way he leaned in when I spoke, how his hand would graze mine when he passed me the sugar, how he’d laugh softly instead of loudly like Alex always did.

When we left, he offered to drive me home. I said yes. In the car, it was quiet for a while, just the sound of the radio playing something old and soft. Then he pulled over near my place and looked at me for a second — not in a creepy way, but in a “are we really doing this?” kind of way.

I’m not going into explicit detail because Reddit doesn’t need it (and honestly I don’t even know how to describe it without sounding… I don’t know… too much). But I will say this: I didn’t go inside right away. We stayed in that car for a long time.

The next morning, I woke up and the first thing I felt was this weird mix of guilt, satisfaction, and power. Like I had taken something back that was stolen from me.

Do I feel bad? Maybe a little. But then I remember the image of my mom in that tight black dress, walking out of the party with Alex, and not coming back for hours. And I stop feeling bad.

His dad texted me yesterday: “Let’s do that again sometime.”

And honestly? I think I might.

First Whispers of the Rot

I’ve seen a lot of bad headlines in my life. Wars, famines, riots, storms that chewed cities down to the foundation. But this morning, over burnt coffee in a dented tin mug, the radio gave me a new one:

""Unconfirmed reports of a viral outbreak in the Philippines, source still under investigation…""

They didn’t say much, just the usual dance; officials urging calm, news anchors wearing that fake composure that tells you they’ve already seen footage they’ll never air. But I caught something in the way the foreign correspondent’s voice cracked halfway through the segment. That wasn’t journalism. That was fear.

Rumors are rolling faster than truth ever will. Some say it’s flu. Some say it’s worse. I’ve heard “rabid” tossed around. Heard about people not staying down. Heard about eyes that cloud over like milk. The official line? “Under control.” Yeah. I’ve heard that one before.

The vet in me, the part they couldn’t strip away after all the dust, heat, and blood... is already counting supplies. Ammo, canned goods, clean water. The last IED I saw didn’t have the decency to give warning before it blew, and neither will this… if it’s real.

Still, I’m not the same green kid I was when I shipped out. I know the difference between panic and preparation. So I’m not panicking. I’m preparing. But between you and me, my hand’s been hovering over that old bug-out pack more than I’d like to admit.

Three months from now, this might be another half-forgotten blip in the endless noise machine. Or… maybe it’s the day the countdown started.

If it was the day… if the SHTF for real… where would you run first? Who would you trust to watch your back?

I (30-ish, M) have been permanently working from home since 2021, and kahit isang beses hindi ako lumabas ng bahay para magtrabaho sa ibang lugar just for a change of view…

I know most people glamorize permanent WFH setup, especially with the sh*tty transportation system we have in this country. But its adverse combination with people who are like me na introvert AF isn’t often thought of. I even reached a point na hindi ako lumalabas nang bahay for more than a week and it didn’t do good to my mental health

Stuff happened and I wanted to go out for a bit of change kasi I might go mad na. Nagpaalam ako na sa labas muna ako mag work pero hindi ako pinayagan hahaha, kesyo hindi raw safe (US Mountain Time work ko), andami raw nangyayaring krimen etc. etc.

We’re a conservative, closely-knitted family. Yung tipong documented lahat ng galaw at dapat alam san ka pupunta. This is not stemming from wanting control, but from concern and care, which I understand. Pero kasi minsan iisipin mo nasa marrying age ka na pero kelangan mo lagi update parents mo nasan ka na kundi they will worry to death. 

I really wanted to try working outside kaya tumakas ako hahaha. Feeling teenager ako na pumupuslit sa gabi. Dala ko yung work equipment ko.

I went to a secure location (malapit sa police station) na pwede magwork tapos dun ako nagtrabaho. Hahaha. Totoo pala na if you are working you have to change locations every now and then kasi it improves focus. Dami ko nagawang trabaho that day… but I made sure nagsabi ako nasaan ako nung nakarating na ko sa coffee shop.

This might sound a bit unusual or even absurd, but I'll be upfront because honesty is key here. I'm a solo resident in a spacious 3BHK apartment in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, and I've been feeling the weight of isolation lately. The walls are starting to close in after a month of this, and I realize I need some human connection to boost my energy, productivity, and overall happiness. I'm not looking for a traditional roommate setup – no rent involved at all. Just someone to share the space with me in a way that's mutually beneficial.

What I'm Offering:
- Free stay in my fully furnished 3BHK. You'll have your own room, and the place is equipped with everything you need for a comfortable, productive life:
  - High-speed WiFi for seamless work-from-home.
  - Two dedicated workstations (perfect for focusing without distractions).
  - Washing machine, TV, Xbox, guitar (for downtime fun), and a complete kitchen setup including a coffee machine, tandoor, and all essentials – no shortages on amenities!
- We'll only split minor shared expenses like food/groceries and maid services (nothing else – utilities are on me).
- A judgment-free zone where we can hang out, chat about daily life, trending topics, world events, or whatever sparks sensible conversation. Think casual evenings sharing stories, boosting each other's motivation, or just unwinding together.

What I'm Looking For:
- Someone productive and sensible, ideally in a work-from-home setup (or flexible schedule) who values personal growth and knowledge about the world.
- A person who's open to building an emotional connection – not in a romantic or invasive way, but as supportive companions. We can share grievances, talk through challenges, and motivate each other to stay productive and positive. Loneliness has been tough for me, and I believe two people supporting one another can make a huge difference in energy and output.
- Mutual respect is non-negotiable: No deep dives into personal lives unless we both choose to. This is about enhancing productivity and combating isolation through light, meaningful interactions – hanging out, discussing ideas, and keeping things uplifting.
- Age/gender/background doesn't matter as long as you're reliable, clean, and aligned with this vibe. Bonus if you're into self-improvement, current affairs, or creative hobbies.

This isn't about filling a room for financial reasons; it's genuinely about creating a space where we can both thrive emotionally and productively. If you're feeling isolated too, or just seeking a low-pressure environment to level up your routine in beautiful Shimla, this could be a great fit. I've got the setup ready – let's turn loneliness into something empowering!

DM me if this resonates. Tell me a bit about yourself, what you're working on, and why you're interested. Looking forward to connecting!

1mois2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mois2u/does_the_shardor_programmable_coffee_maker/,Does the SHARDOR Programmable Coffee Maker Deliver Quality? Honest Features Review,"Programming my mornings for optimum coffee enjoyment has taken a leap forward since adding the SHARDOR Programmable Coffee Maker with Thermal Carafe to my daily routine. This 8-cup drip coffee machine blends functionality with sleek aesthetics, delivering a coffee-making experience that’s both user-friendly and practical. Testing out this gadget over a few weeks, I’ve been plugging it into my pre-coffee groggy mornings, and while it solves many common coffee-maker issues, it’s not without its quirks. Let’s dive into the details.

**Stylish Design and Compact Build**

The design caught my attention upon unboxing. Its black and stainless steel finish looks modern and fits into my kitchen without stealing too much counter space. Measuring 8"" D x 6.7"" W x 12.7"" H, it’s compact, which I appreciated since my countertop real estate is limited. The touch-screen interface is not just functional but also gives it a contemporary vibe. However, fingerprint smudges can be a nuisance on the stainless steel surface, so expect to give it a quick wipe down often if you like your gadgets spotless. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s worth noting for anyone slightly OCD about appliances.

**Programmable Convenience**

One standout feature is the 24-hour programmability. Setting the brew time before bed meant waking up to the aroma of fresh coffee—a little slice of heaven, honestly. I’m someone who treats coffee like a morning ritual, and this feature makes it feel like my butler had everything ready when I woke up. Adjusting the brew strength between regular and strong was simplified thanks to the intuitive touchscreen. It’s perfect for those caffeinated Mondays when a stronger smack of coffee is mandatory. 

[Grab SHARDOR Programmable Coffee Maker B0DLK9SBZ3 at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dlk9sbz3/)

**Thermal Carafe Performance**

Included with this coffee maker is an 8-cup thermal carafe made from stainless steel. I’m not always a fast coffee drinker; sometimes, I sip while answering emails over the course of an hour or so. This carafe kept my coffee hot for several hours without burning the flavor. However, the lid’s vacuum-sealed design can take a bit of strength to screw on tight—it caught me off guard the first time. Still, its ability to keep coffee piping hot earns high praise in my book because reheating coffee in the microwave tends to ruin its flavor.

**Anti-Drip Pause & Serve**

More than once, I found myself grabbing a cup of coffee before the pot had finished brewing. With this coffee maker’s anti-drip system, I could do this mid-brew without a mess on the warming plate. It’s little features like this that speak volumes when you’re running late and need your caffeine fix ASAP. That said, the mechanism could feel a bit stiff at times, so pulling the carafe out during brewing took a little extra coordination.

**Ease of Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning is straightforward, but not entirely effortless. The filter basket, carafe lid, and the touchscreen panel are all easy to wipe down or rinse. Having a reusable filter is a plus—it’s environmentally friendly and eliminates the need for paper filters. However, the carafe’s smaller neck can make the interior tricky to scrub thoroughly. I’d recommend a bottle brush for keeping it spotless since lingering coffee oils can sometimes alter the taste of the next brew.

**Strengths**

- Touchscreen controls simplify brewing adjustments.  
- The 8-cup thermal carafe ensures coffee stays hot for hours.  
- Programmable timer adds early morning convenience.  
- Pause & Serve function minimizes spills during mid-brew interruptions.  

**Negatives**

- Stainless steel finish shows fingerprints easily.  
- Carafe lid can be slightly difficult to tighten securely.  
- The anti-drip system feels a bit stiff during operation.  

**Alternative Products**

In comparison to other programmable coffee makers, the SHARDOR machine finds itself offering functionality similar to brands like Cuisinart or Hamilton Beach. The Cuisinart DCC-3200, for example, has a larger capacity (12 cups) and boasts a self-cleaning feature. However, its bulkier design might not fit smaller kitchens as neatly as this SHARDOR model does. On the flip side, Hamilton Beach’s FlexBrew machine caters to those who want a dual-purpose solution for pods and ground coffee, but it sacrifices the aesthetic polish and thermal carafe of this unit. Ultimately, SHARDOR hits a sweet spot for someone wanting simplicity, reliability, and solid coffee temperature retention. 

**Affordable Quality**

Given the features, this coffee maker offers decent value for those prioritizing programmability and strong brewing results. While it’s not the cheapest unit on the market, its practicality and more upscale touches justify the slightly higher cost compared to basic drip machines. Investing in a machine with these conveniences eliminates those mornings where you impatiently wait for coffee to finish brewing. If you’re someone who loves a well-timed cup of coffee that stays hot throughout your snooze-button-enthusiast mornings, this machine’s worth considering.

Would you kindly take a look and let me know if this excessive (or if I'm missing anything)? The ship has sailed on not appearing a bit ridiculous about it, LOL, but I don't want her to feel the pressure of my anxiety or be overloaded, I just want to be helpful and informative.

If it matters, she has OKed the camera already (it's not to check up on her, I just like knowing that the place isn't on fire) and is aware that my neighbour will be popping in daily as well just in case something were to happen to her or she can't make one of the visits or something. Thanks all!

**NEENER (old, dilute tortie.)**

Meds:

* One PINK pill per day (AM) (thyroid meds)
* One ORANGE pill per day (PM) (thyroid meds)
* Her nightly goo (about 1tsp churu, 1 scoop phosphorous binder, 3 scoops miralax)
* Finger licks of vaseline in bed if she wants it (she will sit and stare at you if so.)
* Nose wiped as needed.

A skipped or doubled dose of any of this stuff is not catastrophic.

She is sneezy and snotty and wobbly/limpy and a little matted, and her lump can get a little crusty. Vet says she’s as good as can be expected for her age. Concerns would be if she cannot walk at all or in respiratory distress.

May lightly nip if you touch her elsewhere than her face/spine.

Can usually be found beside the toilet or on the bed.

**MAY (Grey&white DSH)**

Shy but can usually be coaxed with kibble.

Once you start to pet her she usually warms up right away.

Might be coaxed into playing with the wand.

**SLY (orange cat)**

Accustomed to constant adoration but kind of awkward. Easiest if you just put her on your lap.

**FOOD**

Prepared wet food is in a Tupperware in the fridge.

Additional cans be found under the coffee machine.

Give them a hefty scoop in a bowl at every visit. I commonly leave food out until it’s gone but if it’s really hot, or they seem extra hungry, or you might be delayed, feel free to give them a bowl of kibble too (bag is in the fridge.)

Once per day (PM) they can get a handful of kibble tossed around.

If you need more dishes or cutlery help yourself to the cupboards/drawers.

**LITTER**

As they share the one box please scoop once per day or per visit. Use the bucket to scoop into or there are bags under the coffee maker. Outdoor garbages can be accessed around back if needed.

**VISITS**

Help yourself to whatever, coffee, dishes, tv etc.

Furbo camera is on the console table beside the computer desk in the living room, aimed at the chairs were the cats usually hang out. Please don’t turn it off as I don’t know if I can turn it back on remotely, but toss a cloth over it while you’re there if you like, I only use it to make sure the place isn’t on fire.

If none of the cats is interested in hanging out, don’t feel like you need to stay the whole hour.

**EMERGENCY**

* Carriers are in the hall closet.
* Veterinarian \[NAME/NUMBER\] – there is $300 available on my account there if needed.
* **\[NAME\], my neighbour/backup sitter who will pop in once a day around midday (feel free to text him to coordinate times around your schedule): \[NUMBER\]**
* MOTHER-IN-LAW, MY/MY PARTNER'S NAMES AND NUMBERS
* In the event of any kind of emergency I am reachable to make arrangements for payment as needed. \[MIL\] can also step in here.",0,1755027636.0,RoverPetSitting,4,0.5,False

I don’t have a particularly impressive PhD record and started to feel like the work was meaningless. I am also in a serious relationship and felt like I wanted something more flexible so that my boyfriend and I could choose where we wanted to live.

But that all seems like total bullshit! My boyfriend is currently applying to semiconductor factories (material science PhD) and since he doesn’t know where he’s going to end up, I am applying to only remote roles right now. I have three internships/industry roles in addition to my PhD in psychology and I have been applying for a wide range of market research, insights, survey research, etc. roles. I can’t even get an interview! I’m starting to feel like submitting applications is totally pointless. And yes, I’ve had 15 coffee chats. They’ve been very nice but haven’t yielded anything. One person sent me a role that wasn’t posted anywhere, but I sent her my resume two weeks ago and never heard a thing.

Is it going to be significantly easier to apply for roles in a certain location over remote? Am I essentially wasting my time submitting tens of hundreds of applications to remote roles? 

Honestly I’m not even sure how one would get these jobs? Like I certainly wouldn’t have been able to get into market research with just a bachelors, and now I have almost a decade of experience working with big data. So what’s the deal? They prefer MBAs?

1moil5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1moil5n/discovery_princess_august_310_reviewtips/,Discovery Princess August 3-10 Review/Tips,"Cheerio, we just finished a Discovery Princess Cruise to Alaska. Here' the 411

**Family Details:** Four traveling. Husband, myself, 18 y/o son (this was his senior trip) 15 y/o daughter. Experienced cruisers, but first time on Princess and first time to Alaska. Royal Caribbean loyalist. 

**Embarkation:** We took the shuttle from the Marriott to the pier. It was $45 per person, but we had a lot of luggage and there was no way we could fit in an Uber. One of our luggage tags fell off during transit, but the pier worker had a stapler and fixed it for us. We walked on with just our backpacks. Picked up our medallions (we left on July 29 to visit family in Spokane, we didn't want to risk missing them in the mail).

**Time Frame:** 10:45-11:30 AM from being dropped off at the pier, to being sat in the Ketchikan MDR for an early lunch. 

**Ship:** Discovery seemed to be the largest ship in ports compared to the other cruise lines we docked next to. It was one of the smaller ships we have sailed on, but we've only sailed RC. The ship is lovely. It's clean, bright, tasteful. The interior and exterior are very well maintained. I never saw trash or dirty glasses, plates, etc. anywhere. The common areas, bathrooms, and our stateroom where kept in excellent condition. The gym is small, so be prepared to wait for equipment or go at 5AM or 9PM. Pool deck, basketball and pickleball court where in great shape. 

**Entertainment:** The karaoke was the best entertainment. One show, the Spotlight Bar was good, but we left all the other shows early and hung out watching karaoke. But it's subjective and I'm sure there were people who loved the shows. 

**Rooms:** Two balcony rooms, with connecting balcony. We requested to have our room fitted with a queen bed but it was twins when we arrived. No big deal, the steward fixed it. 

**Medallions:**  We opted to pick them up. Again, because we didn't want to miss them if they were mailed since we left TX on July 29. Upon arrival on the ship we purchased bracelets to hold the medallions, the lanyards are long. This was personal preference for us. After lunch we went to customer service and requested to have the rooms linked so our medallions could work on both doors.

**Tip:** We told the kids that even though their medallions opened our door, if they didn't want to be scarred for life, or dip into their therapy fund early, to knock LOUDLY and WAIT for a verbal ""come in"" they did dry heave a little, but it worked. Any argument they may have had, they worked out on their own and they stayed on their side of the balcony even though we did open the connecting door. 

**Premium Package;** We purchased this for all four of us. Excessive? Probably. Did the hubs and I drink 15 drinks a day and eat 3 premium desserts? No. But we did enjoy plenty of specialty coffee, wine and cocktails. Did the kids? Yes. Every mocktail you could and could not imagine was consumed along with desserts, specialty coffees, etc. Having Wi-Fi was worth it, and also not having to worry if something was or was not included was also worth it. I thought we would take all the fitness classes, we did not. We worked out and lifted weights, but the cardio was taking the stairs and avoiding the elevators at all costs,. 

**Tip:** There are NO smoothie or protein bars on this ship - like NO ONE offers this. Sort of a miss if you ask me. However if you go to the Seaview bar on the pool deck and ask for a banana/strawberry smoothie, they will make you one, you'll have to add your own protein powder to it (if you bring it with you) but it works and is actually pretty good. 

**Dinning**

**Ketchikan MDR/Buffet:** Did Ketchikan for lunch first day on ship and one other time for breakfast. It was decent and on par with standard MDR for cruises. The buffet was good, we did a couple of breakfast there and two lunches. All the breakfast offerings were good. We really enjoyed the salad bar and the Greek bar. 

**Sabatini's:** I'm Italian, and while this isn't what my mom or Nona would make it was actually pretty good. In true Italian form, this meal has a ton of food and takes about 2-2.5 hours to complete. 

**Tip:** While Gigi's is not included in the premium package, they make the pizza that Sabatini's serves. On the second night that we went we just ordered salads and pizza and it was delicious. 

**Rudi's The Catch:** Oh boy. Our first experience here was rough. Our family along with several other parties had participated in the Salmon catch and cook excursion in Ketchikan. The fishing boat captain had made reservations for everyone to have their salmon prepared and served at The Catch. When we arrived along with other fishing buddies, the two host at the front were so incredibly rude. Like, really, really rude. They said that none of us had reservations, they did not have our fish and didn't know where it was, they told one gentleman he didn't know what he was talking about then told us, **did not ask us**, to leave. Ugh. One trip to customer service and in less than 60 seconds the lady had found all of our reservations and our fish. So she went and talked to the hosts, who told her that she didn't know what she was talking about. It took the customers service manager and the restaurant manager talking to the hosts, who then became very attentive to all of us. Our fish was indeed there and being prepared. It was a really bad start for this restaurant. We kept our second reservation for The Catch and gave it another try. It was okay but not spectacular. 

**Crown Grill:** If you only do one fine dinning experience, do this one. It's not like Texas steakhouse great, but the ribeye is very good, very well marbled and all four of our steaks were cooked to a true medium and one was cooked to a true medium Pittsburg style. 

**Room Service:** Whomp-whomp. Sometimes we got our items in 30 minutes, other times it was an hour and still other times it took us calling to find out why our app said it was delivered but we never got it. No rhyme or reason for the drastic time allotment. I know some will say - just go to the bar and get your drinks- and we did. But also, I'm on vacation and sometimes I just wanted a Side Car or Manhattan delivered to me, while I lounged in my PJ's. If you have a toddler, are not feeling well, or have an elderly person that needs to rest and you are heavily relying on this service, you may become frustrated. 

**Excursions:** I booked through Princess. Did I pay more? Maybe. But between senior year/graduation in May and our other daughter getting married in June, I had zero brain cells for researching on my own. 

**Ketchikan**: Guys Salmon Catch and Cook: They loved it, they caught four HUGE king salmon. One was cooked for us and the other three were shipped to our home and actually arrived today - frozen solid.  Girls: We did the Cultural tour. It was perfect for my daughter and I. We learned about the clan houses, the totem poles, ate reindeer sausage and chowder, painted a  raven ornament. Not something that my guys would have enjoyed but we didn't want to fish so win/win. We met at a place called 49'er, a local pub,  and ate halibut tacos before getting back on the boat.  Weather was overcast but 60 degrees and no rain. 

**Juneau:** Helicopter to Mendenhall Glacier and Ice hike. Worth the money. A once in a lifetime experience. This said strenuous next to the description and yes it was. You do need to be in good shape do this, it's a lot of walking in clamps, jumping over ridges and water, up hill and down hill treks, but worth the sore muscles at the end. We asked the driver to let us off at Tracy's Too Crab shack. It was incredible, we had amazing weather and sat outside, then walked 10 minutes back to the boat. There is a Tracy's on the pier , but the locals go to the TOO. 

**Skagway:** We did the White Pass/Yukon train. It was amazing and exactly what we needed after a day of ice hiking. Again, beautiful weather, incredible scenery and our tour guide Sam was amazing. This excursion leaves at 6:45 AM so order room service the night before for 6am - ours didn't show up on time, but yours might. If you don't' get breakfast take some pre packaged granola bars, or you can wait like we did until lunch, but at that point, you could be a little hangry. 

**Victoria:** Meh. If it had just been the hubs and I we either would have just walked to a restaurant or stayed on the boat, but the kids wanted to see some more of Canada, so we did a Abkahazi Garden and Tea room. It was okay, but wouldn't recommend it or anything, I think it was $40 per person, so I didn't feel too bad about the lack luster of it. 

**Disembarkation:** Our flight left later in the day so we did Port Valet. It was free - our flights were through American. We had to plan carefully what we needed for the day of disembarkation (what could fit in our backpacks) and then we sat everything out before we got off the ship for Victoria. We tracked our luggage through the AA app and it was already at the airport and checked in by the time we had gotten off the ship, and ordered an Uber to take us to Pike Market. 

**Tip:** If you have time before your flight leaves, get tickets for the Space Needle and Chihuly Glass Gardens they have a bag check. We dumped the back packs, did the garden (amazing) the Space Needle (cool to say we did it) and ate at a food court called the Armory. We grabbed the bags from bag check and headed to the airport. If you want to hang out in the Centurion Club, they won't let you in earlier than 2-3 hours before your flight, but you'll need to check in and get on the wait list. 

That's it. Alaska was amazing the kids loved it, and our son felt truly celebrated and checked off some major bucket list items. We liked Princess and you really can't compare them to RC, they're just different, but we would do another Alaskan through this line. ",6,1755027349.0,PrincessCruises,2,1.0,False

We dated for 6 months before I found out she was sending nudes to another guy so I broke up with her. I know we probably shouldn’t have but we ended up casually hanging out. When we dated we weren’t that close because we were both very shy, but after we broke up we both opened up a lot and we actually became extremely close like closer than either of us have ever been with someone. I’ve made so many good memories with her during those times

This is where the rollercoaster starts because I left suddenly due to my parents screaming at me to just cut contact. I was too afraid to be honest with her and say anything about her cheating so I just said we lived too far and it crushed her and me because this felt unresolved

A year later we started hanging out again and picked up where we left off. It was fun but it ended the same way and I left and it’s now been 2 years

I went to grab coffee with her recently and decided to express everything to her. How she unintentionally became my best friend and I miss her a lot, but I don’t think I’ve ever fully processed what she did to me. I realized we were supposed to talk about it but we were both always so caught up in the moment that the serious aspect of this was pushed to the back of my mind

I’m not gonna lie I get waves of wondering what to do. She’s seriously my best friend we have perfect synergy, but when I fixate on what she did to me I ask myself why I’m even considering getting back together with her

* My skin cleared and my mood stabilized

1moiinb,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1moiinb/after_his_affair_i_faked_my_wedding_day_death/,"After His Affair, I Faked My Wedding Day Death","Chapter 1

In the quiet of our Los Angeles penthouse, I logged onto social media, my fingers trembling slightly as they navigated the familiar interface. The digital world seemed to spin around me, faster than ever, as I searched for the comfort of routine. But today, something was amiss. My gaze settled on Cameron's profile, a place where his successes and our shared moments had been cataloged like trophies. My heart lurched painfully as the words 'single' blazed across the screen. Two weeks before our wedding. It felt as though someone had reached into my chest and wrenched my heart free.

I sat there, the world tilting on its axis, as disbelief tightened its grip around my chest. Memories of our nine years together flooded my mind — the late nights spent building dreams, the whispered promises of forever. I had been his anchor, his confidante, his unwavering support. Now, it seemed, I was nothing.

The ping of my phone jolted me from my reverie, a harbinger of worse to come. My eyes scanned the email subject line from Vanessa Clarke, Cameron’s assistant, before I dared to open it. What I found unravelled me completely: ninety-nine photos of Cameron and Vanessa, each one a dagger to my soul. They were intimate, revealing more than just betrayal — they showed a life that had been lived in parallel to ours, one filled with deceit and mockery.

Vanessa's accompanying messages were taunts, vicious and unrelenting, detailing their affair with a cruelty that made my skin crawl. How could he? How could they? I collapsed onto the sofa, feeling the world fracture beneath me, the pieces of my life slipping through my fingers like grains of sand.

Darkness descended as I retreated to the sanctuary of my bedroom, the dim light casting shadows that seemed to whisper the truth I feared — that I had been blind, my loyalty misplaced. As the night stretched on, I searched online with a growing resolve, my fingers typing out words that felt foreign and dangerous: 'disappear,' 'staged death,' 'new identity.'

I found Arthur Finch, an operative at a discreet agency specializing in making people vanish from their own lives, leaving only echoes behind. His reputation for meticulous planning and execution was my lifeline, a way to reclaim my agency from the chaos Cameron had wrought.

I scheduled my disappearance for the day that should have been filled with vows and love, my wedding day. The irony did not escape me — a day meant for beginnings would become the day I ended one life to start another. It was my first step toward taking back control, toward exacting revenge on Cameron and escaping the humiliation that now defined my existence.

As I lay in the quiet darkness, the plans settled into my mind like a balm, soothing the raw edges of betrayal. I imagined Cameron's face when he realized the depth of my resolve, the consequences of his actions. The thought was a small comfort in the sea of pain, a reminder that I was not broken, only bent, ready to forge a new path.

The night stretched on, a backdrop to my unfolding scheme, as I prepared to become someone new, someone unburdened by the chains of a love that had been nothing more than illusion. I would watch him from afar, see the fallout of his choices, knowing he had lost the one person who truly loved him.

And as the first light of dawn crept through the window, I felt a flicker of hope. I would survive this. I would emerge stronger, wiser, and unencumbered by the ghosts of betrayal. Cameron would face the emptiness of his actions, while I would disappear from the narrative he had so callously rewritten.

The stage was set, and soon, I would be the one holding all the cards.

Chapter 2

The sun draped its golden veil over Napa Valley, casting everything in a warm, deceptive glow. Chloe Davis’s wedding was the epitome of elegance, a serene affair nestled between rows of lush vineyards. Yet, amidst the laughter and clinking champagne glasses, my heart was a silent storm.

I stood at the edge of the gathering, watching Cameron from a distance. He was dressed impeccably, playing the role of the charming guest with ease. But my eyes were drawn to Vanessa, who hovered at his side like a shadow. Their proximity was too intimate, too familiar, and with every stolen glance between them, my doubts morphed into a certainty that made my stomach churn.

As the ceremony unfolded, I felt detached, as though the world was happening in a muted bubble and I was merely an observer. Then, the moment came—the bridal bouquet toss, a tradition steeped in hope and future promises. But Cameron, with a smile that never reached his eyes, stepped forward, his hand settling on Vanessa's waist.

He took my engagement ring—a symbol of what I thought was our forever—and slid it onto Vanessa's finger, as though she had been the one meant for it all along. The bouquet followed, tossed with careless abandon, landing perfectly in her grasp as if fate itself had conspired against me.

The shock was visceral. My heart constricted, my breath stilled. It was a public declaration, a cruel proclamation of my displacement. The betrayal was now a spectacle, laid bare for all to witness. I felt my resolve crystallize, the fury within me solidifying into a plan.

I slipped away to a terrace overlooking the sprawling vineyards, the air crisp with the scent of earth and grapes. Here, away from prying eyes, I could feel the tears threatening to spill, but I held them at bay. I promised myself I wouldn't endure this humiliation any longer. I would vanish, leaving behind the shards of my shattered life.

In the distance, laughter and music drifted through the air, mocking my misery. I turned my back on the scene, letting the quiet of the vineyards soothe me, if only for a moment. I knew what I had to do. There was no going back.

Back in Manhattan, the city was a blur of noise and motion, yet I moved through it like a ghost. Vanessa found me in a crowded coffee shop, her presence as unwelcome as the bitter taste of betrayal that lingered in my mouth.

She sat across from me, her eyes gleaming with a triumph that made my skin crawl. ""I'm pregnant,"" she declared, her voice slicing through the din of the café. ""With Cameron's child. It's time you step aside, Isabella.""

The world seemed to pause, the air thickening around us. Her words were a dagger, each syllable twisting deeper. Yet, in that moment of despair, something within me shifted. The betrayal had pushed me past the brink, stripping away any remnants of indecision.

I met her gaze with a calmness that belied the turmoil within. ""You don't need to worry,"" I replied, my voice steady, almost detached. ""You can have him.""

Vanessa's smirk faltered, confusion clouding her features as she realized I wasn't going to fight for what she had already claimed. But she didn’t understand; I was beyond fighting. I was ready to erase every trace of my former life.

As I left the café, the city swallowed me up, a cacophony of sounds and chaos. But I was focused, driven by a singular purpose. I would cut all ties, sever every connection to the life Cameron had tainted. My heart was a fortress, fortified against the pain and ready to embrace the unknown.

The countdown to my disappearance had begun, each tick of the clock bringing me closer to freedom. While Cameron remained oblivious, tangled in his web of deceit, I prepared to disappear—to start anew and leave him to face the void of his own making.

As I walked away, the city lights flickering against the night sky, I felt a strange sense of peace. For the first time, the path ahead was mine alone, unburdened by the shadows of betrayal. And as the light faded, I knew that soon, Cameron would learn the true consequences of his actions.

The stage was set for my departure, and I would watch from afar, knowing he had lost the one person who truly loved him. In that quiet resolve, I felt the stirrings of hope—a promise of new beginnings and the courage to embrace what lay beyond.

Chapter 3

The Brooklyn brownstone stood inconspicuous among its neighbors, weathered brick and wrought-iron railings giving no hint of the secrets exchanged within. I glanced over my shoulder before climbing the steps, my heart hammering against my ribs. This meeting would erase Isabella Martinez from existence.

Arthur Finch opened the door before I could knock, his expression as neutral as his gray suit.

""Ms. Martinez. Right on time."" He ushered me inside, the heavy door closing with a finality that made my breath catch.

The interior was surprisingly ordinary—tasteful antiques, leather-bound books, the soft ticking of a grandfather clock. It looked like a respectable lawyer's office, not the headquarters for orchestrated disappearances.

""Please, sit."" Arthur gestured to a chair across from his desk, then retrieved a leather portfolio. ""I have everything prepared.""

He laid out documents with methodical precision—bank records, identity papers, travel arrangements. My new life, condensed into manila folders.

""Your documentation."" He slid a passport across the polished wood. ""Camille Hayes. Thirty-two. Art consultant. Originally from Chicago, recently relocated to London after your divorce.""

I opened the passport with trembling fingers. The woman in the photo was me, yet somehow not me. Same features, different hair, subtle makeup changes. A stranger wearing my face.

""The resemblance is close enough for documentation, different enough to avoid immediate recognition,"" Arthur explained, noting my expression. ""The digital footprint for Camille has been established over the past year. Social media, credit history, employment records. Nothing flashy, nothing that invites scrutiny.""

I signed where he indicated, my signature transforming with each document—evolving from Isabella Martinez to Camille Hayes. With each stroke of the pen, I felt myself becoming someone else.

""And the... event?"" I couldn't bring myself to say ""my death.""

""All arranged for your wedding day. The body double is a highly sophisticated prop, virtually indistinguishable from a real person upon casual observation. The confusion will be sufficient until you're safely away."" Arthur's clinical tone made it sound like we were discussing a business merger rather than my staged demise.

""Will it hurt him?"" I asked, surprising myself with the question.

Arthur's eyes met mine, the first hint of emotion crossing his features. ""That, Ms. Martinez, depends entirely on how much he cared in the first place.""

I left the brownstone an hour later, Camille Hayes's passport burning in my purse like a live coal.

\* \* \*

That evening, our penthouse felt cavernous in its emptiness. Cameron was in Seattle, courting investors—or perhaps with Vanessa. I no longer knew which of his stories were true.

I sat in his study, the room where he'd built his empire, my laptop casting blue shadows across his mahogany desk. One by one, I closed our joint accounts, transferring my personal savings to the offshore accounts Arthur had established. Each keystroke felt like cutting another cord that had bound me to Cameron.

As the numbers dwindled in our shared accounts and grew in Camille's, I felt a strange calm settle over me. Nine years of my life had been an investment in us, in him. Now I was reclaiming what was mine.

The final transfer completed with an anticlimactic digital ping. I leaned back in Cameron's leather chair, running my fingers along the armrests where his hands had rested countless times. Would he sit here after my ""death,"" grieving the woman he'd already replaced? Would Vanessa comfort him in this very chair?

The thought should have wounded me. Instead, it strengthened my resolve.

\* \* \*

The next morning, I began methodically erasing myself from our home.

I packed my wardrobe first—designer dresses Cameron had insisted I wear to his corporate events, shoes that had pinched my feet but matched his vision of the perfect tech mogul's partner. Each item went into suitcases that would be shipped to a storage facility under Camille's name.

Next came the photos. Us in Bali for our fifth anniversary. The candid shot from his company's launch party, where I'd spent the entire evening ensuring his potential investors were comfortable while he pitched his vision. The framed picture from college—two smiling kids with nothing but dreams and instant ramen.

I removed each one, leaving behind bare walls and empty spaces. The penthouse transformed, becoming a showroom rather than a home—all neutral décor and impersonal touches.

As I placed the last photo in a box, I paused. It was us at Chloe's engagement party last year, Cameron's arm around my waist, both of us laughing at something off-camera. We looked happy. We looked real.

Had it all been a lie? Or had something changed along the way—something I'd missed while I was busy supporting his dreams?

I closed the box, sealing away that question with all the others I would never have answered.

Standing in our hollowed-out penthouse, I realized Cameron might not even notice what was missing until it was too late. He hadn't truly seen me in years.

Soon, he never would again.",1,1755027195.0,romancenovels,4,0.67,False

1moigiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1moigiq/a_recent_post_about_husband_hitting_on_and_saing/,A recent post about husband hitting on and SAing wife’s friends,"It reminded me of 2 of my own experiences that I haven’t thought about in years.

TLDR I think her husband did it in purpose and it wasn’t the first time.

I worked in a restaurant with a married couple, we were all in our early twenties, and they got married young because she needed visa. He was our managers and always put us on the same shifts. We all hang out outside of work and I’ve been to their house many times. They both shared that they didn’t know if their marriage was going to be forever but they were happy for now. They were both willing to try an open relationship because neither of them has explored much before getting married. 

We all talked openly about everything. It felt like having two really close friends. I was comfortable with them both and honestly thought our friendship would last forever.

One night I was on the closing shift with the husband and he had a checklist on a clipboard to complete. For whatever reason he placed the clipboard on my thigh as I sat next to him. I’m like wtf man and laughed it off. 

That was a start of him crossing my boundaries a little more each time. Over the next few weeks he got more handsy, either finding an excuse to touch me or asking me to get something from the store room, following me in there and then blocking my exit as a joke. 

I never told the wife as none of it was serious and I also noticed she grew a bit distant.

It escalated when he tried to kiss me in the store room one night and I made it clear I wasn’t interested. 

Then suddenly he changed my shifts so I never worked with the wife again and he also cut my hours. I told him I would have to leave the job if he kept doing that and he just shrugged. I then left the job and asked the wife out for a coffee. She refused to meet with me and till this day I don’t know why. I think he probably told her I hit on him. 



The second thing was in my first office job there as a guy who instantly gave me the creeps, even thought he was a ‘nice guy’. He kept asking me out and finding excuses to come to my desk. He was very flirty but has been there longer than me so I just politely said I was busy whenever he gave me attention. Then another girl started and I just told her to be careful as he could be a bit intense. Occasionally I would share with her his behaviour. She just laughed it off.

I found out a year later they have been in a secret relationship since shortly after she started. She confided in me because they were moving in together and he proposed. 

I just said congratulations. We went out for drinks later and I asked her if his behaviour to other women didn’t put her off. Apparently he was only flirting with me so that nobody would suspect they were together. Relationships were allowed in the office and there was no policy against it. After they announced their relationship he hit on me at a Christmas party and said he has wanted me ever since I started working there. I left early and he sent me a Snapchat calling me a bitch that’s just playing hard to get. I asked to switch teams but never told anyone why. He occasionally still messages me on LinkedIn and asks me for a coffee even though I don’t respond. It has been almost ten years and they are still together. 

I think most of us have stories like this and it’s always the ‘nice guys’ that nobody would suspect. That’s why I don’t believe his excuse that he was drunk and unaware. Men do this, they test boundaries and escalate their behaviour.

Mom was gravely ill, and on the way to visit her with my husband, Dominick, we had an accident. In a stroke of luck within misfortune, my life was spared, but I lost my right leg. Dominick cried when he heard the news, yet he signed the consent for surgery.

After losing my leg, I accidentally overheard Dominick talking to his friend: ""Hey, Dom, there's a top-notch medical team in Germany. With one call, Irene's leg could have been saved. Why did you still agree to the amputation?""

""Brooklynn needs a young woman with an amputation to be her advertising spokesperson. This is the first time Brooklynn has asked me for help since she returned. It's just a leg; I have to help her,"" Dominick replied.

His friend couldn't help but ask, ""Dom, what about the baby Irene is carrying...?""

""I gave her some medicine. The baby will be gone too. Even though Irene loses a leg and can't have kids, I can guarantee she'll be comfortable for the rest of her life. But my lost love, only this moment can prove it.""

If this is how it is, I will reclaim everything.

...

I stared despondently at the empty pillbox on the table, my body shaking uncontrollably. Dominick came in and held me tightly, as if afraid I'd disappear. His performance moved those watching.

""Irene, where did you go? I couldn't find you no matter how hard I tried. You don't know how worried I was!"" His display of devotion wasn't enough, though, as he suddenly noticed the blood on my pants and his face turned pale, as if he hadn't expected so much bleeding.

He shouted for the doctor, who entered and also turned white-faced. ""Doctor, my wife is bleeding so much; what's happening to her?""

With a serious look, the doctor replied, ""Mr. Palmer, we just got the report; your wife is pregnant. She may have suffered severe impact during the accident... I'm afraid... the baby can't be saved.""

Dazed, I looked up and saw Dominick and the doctor exchange glances, and my heart plunged into an abyss. My trembling hand reached for my abdomen, feeling its last warmth. He truly went through with it – he killed my child.

The bleeding continued, and I was rushed into surgery for a D&C procedure. Coming out of the operating room, Dominick held my hand with painful restraint, trying to comfort me, ""Irene, it'll be okay... it'll be okay. We can have kids in the future.""

Can we really? This baby might have threatened Brooklynn’s status, so he didn't hesitate to kill it before it was born. What about the next one? There will never be another. Severe uterine bleeding meant my uterus had to be completely removed to save my life. I could never be a mother.

The patients and families passing by were all won over by Dominick's attentiveness. Some even commented that I wasn't deserving. Dominick vehemently corrected them, ""My wife is a good person; she's just not good at expressing herself. Don't misunderstand her. She and I have weathered hardships together, and I won't allow anyone to belittle her.""

""My wife loves me!"" he said emphatically, looking back at me, ""And I love her too."" The applause was overwhelming.

To prove his ""And I love her too,"" he stayed by my side in the hospital, attending to me without rest. Finally, his mother, Ellie, couldn't hide her dissatisfaction.

The call came, venomous as if confronting an enemy. ""Irene, are you really causing such a fuss over one missing leg? Do you know how many people in the company depend on Dominick for their livelihood?""

""Can't you weigh the importance of things?""

""How can you be so selfish!""

Ellie never liked me because I came from a single-parent family and had a sick mother. She thought I was marrying above my station and would pick fights to humiliate me. With one blow after another, I could barely contain the suffocating emotions that were close to bursting out.

Dominick seemed to sense it, taking the phone out of my hand, ""Mom, the company can go under for all I care. Nothing compares to Irene.""

""I love her!""

My heart skipped a beat. How I had once longed to hear those words from him. Even when our relationship was at its peak, he never expressed it to me like that. Yet now, hearing it only filled me with dread.

I no longer wanted to see him and urged him to return to the company. Dominick reluctantly held my hand, pressing it against his face, ""Irene, you're the most understanding wife in the world. Wait for me to come back; I have a surprise for you.""

I nodded without any expectation, slipping into a hazy sleep. I just wanted to heal quickly and leave this place, leave Dominick behind.

Chapter 2

Suddenly, I sensed someone's gaze blatantly assessing me.

I opened my eyes to see Brooklynn. A chill spread from my remaining left leg up through my entire body. Brooklynn smirked slightly, glancing at my leg with a triumphant air, and called out.

""Dominick, Irene's awake.""

Dominick was drinking coffee, rushing over without bothering to set his mug down. Brooklynn casually took the mug from his hands.

""I can't stand when men drink coffee all day. It's so draining,"" she teased.

Dominick seemed unfazed, smiling warmly with unmistakable adoration. Despite being in his thirties, he carried a surprising hint of youthful awkwardness.

""I forgot you prefer tea. I swear, from today, I'll switch! I'll switch!""

My pupils widened, and a bitter resentment flooded my chest, as if it were corroded entirely. I’ve told Dominick countless times about my severe allergy to smoke, yet now he decided to quit coffee instead. And he made such a promise to another woman so effortlessly. Could he really compromise like that? It left me feeling redundant and powerless.

Brooklynn seemed to have a sudden realization, taking out a box. As she opened it, I stared at her, my face pale like a porcupine ready to defend itself. Remembering what Dominick and Andrew had said, my whole body tensed, filled with distrust.

Brooklynn's lips curled slightly, ""I personally chose this gift for you, Irene. Dominick's seen it and thinks you'd love it.""

""I don't want it. Take it away! Dominick, tell her to leave!""

My prosthetic leg fell to the ground with a thud, nearly hitting Brooklynn. Immediately, her eyes filled with tears as she held the prosthetic innocently, looking at Dominick.

""Did I do something wrong?""

Dominick comforted her with a gentle pat on the shoulder. Turning to me with furrowed brows, he said, ""Irene, this is Brooklynn's heartfelt gesture. If you don’t appreciate it, fine, but why throw things at her?""

""Brooklynn's legs are meant for ballet; what if she's injured?""

And what about my leg? Was it not important? Was I just destined to be disabled?

Driven to desperation, I shouted, ""If you hadn't insisted on going to her new company, I wouldn't be like this! I don't want to see her; tell her to get out!""

""It was just an accident; it had nothing to do with Brooklynn.""

Dominick ignored my hurt expression and continued defending Brooklynn, ""This prosthetic was something Brooklynn dedicated several days and nights to designing specifically for you. It's made of the finest materials and feels just like a real leg when you wear it.""

False things remain false; they can never be real! I'll never walk freely on my own feet like everyone else again.

Suddenly, my phone rang, and as I answered it, my face went pale. My mom didn't get to see me one last time. Tears welled up as I pushed Dominick away, trying to stand but losing balance due to my missing leg. Dominick caught and steadied me as I struggled.

Clutching his hand, I showed my vulnerability, ""My mom passed away. I need to go see her off!""

Dominick’s expression subtly changed, and he picked up the prosthetic, insisting on helping me put it on. I pushed him away angrily, but he held my hand firmly.

""Irene, wear it. You wouldn't want your mom to see you incomplete and worry as she departs.""

""I promise, once you wear long pants, it won't be obvious at all. I'll take a photo for you to see, alright?""

""Don’t try to be strong anymore. Let’s go see our mom off together.""

I don’t know why, but hearing him say 'our mom' made a wave of nausea and revulsion wash over me. How dare he say such hypocritical things?

Finally, drained of all strength, I dressed in the prosthetic leg, moving like a lifeless shell. When Dominick showed me the photo he’d taken, despite his efforts to hide it, the mechanical nature of the ankle stood out starkly.

I’ve lost my leg forever. I’ve lost my child. And I’ve lost a love that was etched into my very being.

1moidbf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1moidbf,UPDATE: Successful birthday coffee pop-up!,"Thank you to everyone who gave their tips and suggestions in a previous post. The day was pretty successful! I served about 20-25 drinks all in all, albeit over the course of 3-5 hours. Which for an entirely manual set-up can't be too bad at all! This was just for fun and not for commercial purposes.

Pictured is my set-up, including two coolers. One was for the corn milk, cream top, and other dairy and dairy alts. The other was simply for ice. The menu I created by hand and had blown up and printed. 

I excluded pics of friends and family for privacy reasons, but a lot of those have them holding their drinks 😂. At least I took a pic of one of the specials, which was my blueberry corn latte, while recipe testing. 

Everything was handmande/homemade from the syrups to the toppings. I tried to only out seasonal items on the menu with ingredients that were growing in the garden or within an arm's reach. 

In terms of workflow, I pretty much had everything figured out. I had about a week to practice and that was what got me really comfortable in the chaos. Dosing the coffee was a huge help, as I didn't need to measure out my 18g per drink. I used some medical equipment as tubes which were a really cheap alternative to some of the dosage tubes you see designed specifically for coffee nerds. 

I didn't have mittens, or an extra basket. I don't think either would have made much a difference, especially because I'm only working off a manual grinder. My arms surprisingly were pretty good throughout the whole day, it was only the day after that they felt really sore. I enlisted help from those that were interested and one friend even got to pull her own shot and make her drink entirely. 

I didn't have an extra scale to fit under my Robot. It was ordered, but didn't arrive in time. At times, it was so chaotic, I would forget to set a timer for my shot but I would go entirely off muscle memory and tactile feel from the arms. That process reminded me why I love the Robot so much-- its the process and feedback the machine gives you and it shows in its results. 

I think my setup for washing could have been better, but it worked for the time being. I had access to a sink if I wanted to give anything a really thorough clean, and to empty out the bucket when needed. 

Not pictured is the Bellman Stovetop steamer for latte art, but no one ended up ordering hot drinks anyways. 

All in all, it was a pretty fun day. If I were to improve anything, it would be to get an automatic setup if I was really trying to profit off this. But for the time being, it was actually really cool to wow guests with manual espresso and having the beans ground manually. People were very curious, even the non-coffee drinkers were ordering drinks! 

If any of you have ever considered serving for guests at a larger scale, even for something intimate like a birthday party, I highly encourage it. Be sure to manage expectations with this machine. Volume wasn't my goal, but rather quality through the drinks and the experience. I was very intentional with my entire process and I think that paid off greatly! I also didn't limit myself to a certain timeframe pumping out drinks, which helped me pace myself. There was espresso flowing until sundown, which left people wired, but entirely pleased. 

Let me know if you guys have any questions, comments, or even suggestions on how to improve! And thanks again for all your support and encouragement. I would do this again in a heartbeat. ",5,1755026864.0,CafelatRobot,4,0.86,False

1moi6rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerStationHub/comments/1moi6rp/does_the_roland_jx08_synthesizer_live_up_to_the/,Does the Roland JX-08 Synthesizer Live Up to the Hype?,"The Roland JX-08 synthesizer immediately caught my attention with its retro charm and modern functionality. This tabletop synth is a perfect recreation of the 1985 JX-8P but with a contemporary edge. As someone who toyed with clunky keyboards in the early 2000s and struggled to replicate those nostalgic, warm tones from '80s classics, this instrument felt like a bridge between two different timelines. It's lightweight, compact, and sophisticated enough for professional-level gigs but also forgiving enough for beginners like my nephew, who cautiously approaches anything musical with wide-eyed curiosity.

**Design and Build**  
At just three pounds, it's shockingly portable without compromising on durability. The brushed metal finish gives it a classy, sleek look, making it stand out on my workstation. It’s not just about looks, though—the functionality is well-thought-out. The control layout pays homage to the original JX-8P while enhancing usability with a full panel of hands-on adjustments inspired by the vintage PG-800 programmer. The inclusion of both classic and USB Type-C connectors (hello, 2023!) is a relief for someone like me who juggles between old and new gear simultaneously. Occasionally, I overlook things like body material, but the sturdy metal build secures its spot on my cluttered desk amidst other synths, cables, and coffee mugs.

**Good Points**  
- Authentic recreations of the JX-8P’s warm, hybrid sound.  
- Expanded polyphony offering up to 20 voices.  
- Sleek and portable design.  
- Stunning array of effects, including Juno-106 chorus and SDD-320 reverb.  

[Check Roland JX-08 price on Amazon.](https://cavenyc.com/p/b09qs3qrfd/)  

**Performance and Features**  
Musically, this synthesizer is in a realm of its own. The nostalgia-inducing 32 presets from the classic JX-8P come pre-installed, but Roland didn’t stop there—they've packed in an additional 111 brand-new presets. The sound sculpting options gave me sleepless nights full of exploration; I swear I’ve only scratched the surface of what it can do. The 64-step polyphonic sequencer with dual-part capabilities ticks all the boxes for someone who loves layering sounds but hates complexity. The sequencer worked wonders during my experimentation with arpeggios and random-generated patterns, some of which turned out eerily perfect for a project I was secretly cooking up.

It also includes 17 new customizable effect types, ranging from a lo-fi compressor to a super filter. Paired with the onboard arpeggiator, it opens up creative possibilities I didn’t even realize I had until I dove into its settings. Expanded polyphony upgrades this model significantly from the original hardware, making it a much more adaptable and versatile instrument for modern compositions or live performances.

**Negatives**  
- Learning curve for mastering all sequencer functionalities.  
- Occasional unresponsive knobs during simultaneous adjustments.  

**Battery or USB—Pick Your Path**  
Convenience takes center stage when it comes to powering this synthesizer. With the ability to switch between USB-C connectivity and four AA batteries, portability gets a major thumbs up. My cousin borrowed it for an outdoor jam session; surprisingly, the battery backup held its ground when combined with a Bluetooth speaker. While USB-C remains the go-to for me indoors, the battery option adds an excellent layer of flexibility, especially for those who adore spontaneous trips to serene, creative spots.

**Product Competitors**  
Stacking it up against some mainstream synthesizers like the Korg Minilogue and Arturia MicroFreak, the Roland JX-08 excels in an area the others slightly falter: preserving that analog-digital hybrid warmth. While Arturia is teeming with wild and experimental oscillators—perfect for edgy creations—it lacks the vintage charm I adore. Korg Minilogue has its rich offerings, but Roland's wider polyphony and nostalgic presets tip the scales for me. They all have their niches, but the Roland JX-08 feels like a love letter to anyone chasing the sound of a bygone era with today’s tools.

**Quality for Price**  
Though synthesizers aren’t the cheapest addition to any musician's toolkit, this one manages to strike a great price-to-quality ratio. Its blend of nostalgic essence and new-age functionality feels like a bargain for sound engineers or hobbyists itching to expand their home studios. Whether you’re dipping your toes into the synthesizer world or replacing an older module, this seems like a smart buy. The retro patches and new effects alone make it feel like an investment into an ever-expanding coffee shop-style album I’ve been working on.

I just want to wake up and have a chance to do it again, to try again. Every month, every year that passes my life gets steadily more and more isolated, mundane, boring, repetitive, lonely. And I’ve realized it’s because I never took the time to get to know myself and I still don’t know myself. I don’t know what I want. I don’t have any hopes anymore, no dreams, no hobbies, no friends, no goals, I wake up and experience the same day on repeat.

I wake up, get the kids off to school, start the coffee, clock in to my humiliating customer service job (WFH) doing tech support for ungrateful and astonishingly entitled midwits. Then I go and wake my wife up and she clocks in, doing similar work for the same company, just in a different department. In between calls and tickets, I watch YouTube, do as many chores as I can force myself to get through, and wait for the kids to come home. Clock out. Make - more often buy - dinner. Then it’s nothing 3 days a week, the other four I’m working another WFH job. Then bed. Rinse, repeat.

Financially, I’m white knuckling it. As long as the checks keep coming I can probably keep paying the bills. For now. All the while, my debt slowly increases. More and more every month. It’s such a constant source of low-level stress, that I honestly don’t even care anymore. I’m just waiting for it all to come crashing down. 

I’m physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually exhausted. I’m so tired. All the time. Here lately I don’t even know if depression is the right word for it.  Though the anhedonia is noticeably worse… even playing games brings me no joy anymore. I get excited, spend money I don’t have on a game I don’t need, launch it, see how much time and effort it’s going to take, realize it’s a huge time investment… close the game, uninstall it. I try reading and just fall asleep. I could exercise… but why? Who am I trying to impress? I know I should, I have an enlarged liver, early stage NAFLD which is easily reversible, but I just don’t care anymore. 

I’m living like my dad did. Working to live, living to work, and one day to my utter shock I’m going to just… die. Like he did. One day here, the next… not.

I’m so deeply unsatisfied with my lot in life and there is absolutely no off ramp. And why should I deserve one? I have responsibilities and obligations to the people who need me, my wife and children. So what if one day it all gets to be too much and I just end it all.

I’ve spent my whole life trying to emulate what I thought a good life was supposed to be and all it’s gotten me is fat, tired, broke, joyless, stressed, and ready to punch out. I wanted to be a writer, but I’m not good enough. I wanted to be artistic, but I’m just not. I wanted meaningful work, but I have bills to pay. I wanted to be authentically me, to explore myself and experience different relationships but I was too ashamed to be open with myself and others, so I brutally squashed that part of myself and instead slept with any woman who would have me so I didn’t have to feel anything. Then I got married and now, after ten years, porn is my nightly companion.

My life isn’t mine. I’m not me. I’m just a placeholder waiting to be filled up by an actual person.

In the seedy part of a small town, a high-end BMW was parked on the street. It stood out so much since it didn't match the lowly surroundings. 

At the same time, a girl in a pair of worn-out jeans walked toward the car with an emotionless face and an old suitcase in her hand. 

The middle-aged man in the driver's seat took a glance at the girl from the corner of his eye and let out an evident frown. It was obvious that he was dissatisfied with how plain she dressed. 

""Come on. Get in the car,"" the man instructed. 

Meanwhile, the girl remained expressionless. 

She was neither excited to be able to ride a luxury car nor was she frightened by the man's cold attitude. 

As instructed, she opened the car door and sat in the back seat. 

Inside, the girl quickly noticed that there was already another girl of her age sitting in the front passenger seat. 

She was dressed completely different compared to the girl in front of her, who donned gorgeous clothes and accessories that had never been seen in the whole town before. 

""So, that's her..."" Maria Jenkins softly mumbled to herself. 

She had recognized the girl in the passenger seat. It was Vivian Jenkins, the new actress who started gaining popularity in the country just recently and was quickly rising to fame. 

The man in the driver's seat looked at Maria through the rearview mirror and said, ""From now on, you will be my daughter. I am taking you back to Sheffield, where you'll live your new life. I'll arrange for someone to teach you how to behave befitting an affluent lady. Learn to adapt to your new identity as the daughter of the Jenkins family as soon as possible. By the way, this is Vivian, my daughter. You must have already seen her on the Internet.""

But as soon as Bill Jenkins finished speaking, Vivian burst into silvery laughter. 

Speaking in Spanish, she commented, ""Dad, have you seen how poor she is? How could she possibly surf the Internet and watch my show?""

At first, Bill was stunned that Vivian talked to him in fluent Spanish. But then, he nodded approvingly and replied in the same language, ""I see you've already made great progress in your Spanish. That's good, but that was a little impolite, dear.""

Vivian chuckled and responded in Spanish again, ""Well, I'm afraid my new sister won't like what I said, so I chose to talk to you in this language.""

Bill was actually amused by his daughter, but he cast her a faint smile and lightly shook his head. ""Although she can't be as excellent as you, she is still a distant relative. In fact, it will be ideal for us if she can become your substitute to marry into the Wilson family.""

""Dad, how can you say that in front of her? Now, you're the one who's being impolite.""

Under the assumption that their conversation would be incomprehensible to Maria, they continued conversing in Spanish without scruple. 

Besides, they had investigated the town in advance. There were only two Spanish teachers in this remote place, and they didn't even graduate college. 

If the teachers' standard was already that poor, then they could only conclude that Maria's education was also subpar. In other words, it should be impossible for her to understand what they were talking about. 

Before long, the luxury car drove out of the impoverished town. 

Since Maria didn't have anything better to do on the way to her new home, she took out an old laptop from her backpack while the two were chatting. 

All this time, she acted like she really didn't understand their conversation and began typing away. 

""Oh! You know how to use a laptop, Maria?""

Seeing the device sitting on Maria's lap, Vivian couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. 

As far as she knew, there were indeed more than a hundred families in that worn-down town whose surname was Jenkins. Although her father managed to climb up the ladder, he still had blood ties to these poor, annoying relatives. 

Maria lost her parents at a young age, so she grew up with the help of these relatives. 

It was already a miracle that she didn't starve to death as an orphan and even graduated from high school without any problem. 

Due to her living situation, it was unthinkable that she could possess a laptop. 

""This? It's just for playing games,"" Maria answered in a low and indifferent voice. 

Hearing her flat tone, a trace of contempt flashed through Vivian's eyes. 

Did she just say that it was for playing computer games? 

But then, Vivian realized that she shouldn't be surprised. This kind of entertainment was only suited for ordinary people like Maria. 

Vivian also noticed that the surface of the laptop looked so old that she couldn't even identify the brand. 

""How much did you buy it for?"" She continued to feign her curiosity just to find out how Maria got it. 

""I didn't spend anything for it."" After a brief pause, Maria elaborated, ""I worked in a small digital shop back in town. When the shopkeeper couldn't afford my salary, he started giving me spare parts as compensation. Eventually, I managed to assemble this laptop myself.""

It turned out to be an assembled laptop from old spare parts. 

What a low-end digital product. Surely, just as Maria said, it could only be used for nothing more than playing games. 

At the same time, Vivian also wasn't that knowledgeable about computers, so she immediately believed that Maria's laptop was nothing but a piece of junk. 

""Well, I guess that laptop matches you very well."" Vivian giggled and let out subtle smirk. 



  Master M

Out of growing curiosity, Vivian narrowed her eyes. ""Maria, how much was your salary supposed to be? I can't imagine why your boss couldn't even afford to pay you in full.""

As a matter of fact, she really was wondering how Maria got by back in that seedy town. 

Her father was a known wealthy businessman in Sheffield. 

At the same time, Vivian was also making a name for herself. Aside from signing to Yeez Entertainment, she had already obtained lots of resources just half a year after her debut. 

After nailing her role in a TV series and a reality show, she easily made over a million dollars. 

On the other hand, Maria worked in a digital shop in a small town after graduating from high school, so Vivian couldn't help but take an interest in how much she was earning from that kind of job. In the back of her mind, Vivian even suspected what Maria earned was probably nowhere near what she spent on her mani-pedi. 

""The income isn't fixed. It depends on the orders we receive in the shop. Unfortunately, the shop wasn't really doing well recently. There were only a few orders, and my boss seemed to be running at a loss lately so he was forced to give me laptop parts and accessories as compensation.""

Maria elaborated as if it was nothing. Finding it very amusing, Vivian chuckled again. 

""You got paid based on orders you received? Isn't that the same as being a temporary worker in a factory?""

After that comment, Vivian didn't say anything more. She just lightly shook her head and let out a sigh of pity. In her mind, Maria's job was no different from being a lowly production worker. 

At this time, a chat box suddenly popped up on Maria's computer screen. 

""Master M, please advise if you could take this job. Thank you.""

Seeing this message, Maria took a quick glance at the order request. It read, ""The website of an international Children's Charity Foundation was attacked by hackers. They are urgently requesting to reinforce their firewall.""

Then, she looked further and saw that the payment for the job was only three hundred thousand dollars. 

Maria's network ID in her line of work was M, but the staff addressed her as Master M to show utter respect. Apparently, she was a member of Heaven, a well-known hacker organization. The staff would receive orders or jobs from various companies and groups, and they would forward them to hackers of this organization, such as Maria, to take them on. 

Since the reward for this particular request was only three hundred thousand dollars, it was impossible to persuade a divine-level hacker in Heaven to take the job. In fact, this amount barely met the standard fees of ordinary hackers inside the organization. 

However, this charity organization encountered a special situation. Their website was supposed to be very safe and secure, but it still got infiltrated by hackers. If they wanted to reinforce and upgrade their system's defense, they would need a specialist—one with higher technical capabilities. Of course, the average-level hackers in Heaven weren't suited for the job. 

Fortunately, the staff knew that among the few divine-level hackers, only Master M would take orders based on her mood and not the reward. 

If the client was lucky enough, even if they could only pay a mere thirty thousand, Master M might consider taking the job. 

Therefore, with this in mind, the staff tried to push his luck and came to Maria. While waiting for her reply, he couldn't help but feel extremely anxious. 

""Fine. Ask the client to send the IP address and all relevant data. I'll update it online soon.""

Getting the affirmative reply he was hoping for, the staff was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief, then quickly relayed the information to the client. 

Soon enough, Maria received everything she asked for. 

Before starting, she cracked her knuckles and began to tap the keyboard with her fingers as light and accurate as possible. She was like a pianist whose fingers danced harmoniously. Her beautiful and clear eyes were fixed on the computer screen the whole time as if she was being drawn to it. 

At the same time, her laptop was equipped with a silent keyboard. That way, no matter how fast she typed, it wouldn't make any sound. 

It only took a short while for Maria to write a complex set of codes. Even for those who had knowledge in this field, her codes seemed to be as obscure as a mystic foreign language. 

""It's done.""

Maria messaged the staff as soon as she finished the task. 

Normally, upon the completion of an order, the client would check the work first before proceeding with the payment. 

However, when the client learned that it was Master M who had taken the job, they already transferred the money to her account without having to check first. 

In just a matter of a few minutes, Maria finished a tedious task and gained a commission of three hundred thousand dollars. 

""Excellent! Thank you so much, Master M! You saved a lot of charity funds just in the nick of time. Those kids who will receive financial help from our client will definitely be grateful to you!""

""No need to thank me. It's my job, and I got paid for it. It's just normal business.""

As soon as Maria sent her reply, she exited the chat box and closed the laptop lid. 

""Oh, you're done playing?""

It turned out that Vivian had been observing Maria all this time. Apparently, she had a feeling that her new sister looked particularly occupied just for a game. She wasn't too stupid not to suspect that Maria was doing something else. 

""It ran out of battery..."" Maria replied casually like it was a usual occurrence. 

""Really? Ha-ha!""

Hearing this response, Vivian couldn't help but laugh hard. All her suspicions earlier had been set aside. 

Now, all she could think of was how lousy this laptop was. 

Maria had only been using it for less than thirty minutes, but it had already run out of power. 

She believed it was nothing compared to her laptop. After all, Vivian just bought a new one three months ago which cost her a fortune. With its high-end specs, it could run for twenty-four hours straight without having to connect to a power source. 



 New Home

After quite a long drive, the trio finally arrived at a river-view villa. 

As soon as Maria got out of the BMW, she saw a maid waiting for them at the gate. 

""Mr. Jenkins, Miss Jenkins, welcome back! I have been waiting for you guys. Lunch is ready.""

""Yes, please. I'm starving! Did you cook my favorite garlic shrimp, Lily?""

Vivian asked with an expectant look. At the same time, the maid called Lily hurriedly took her bag with a warm smile. 

""Yes, of course! Everything's ready inside. Please go wash up and enjoy the lunch."" Lily adored Vivian so much. She always looked at the young woman as if she was an avid fan looking up at her idol. 

""You've just arrived, so you shouldn't be familiar with the surroundings. Anyway, Lily, the maid here, will show you around the house. For now, she will accompany you to the room I prepared for you,"" Bill said flatly. 

Then, he turned to Lily and instructed her, ""This is Maria. From now on, she'll be part of this family, as my daughter of course. Show her to her room so she can settle down first.""

""Yes, Mr. Jenkins, right away.""

Lily bowed respectfully before standing still again. 

However, instead of a welcoming smile, she glanced coldly at Maria and didn't bother helping her carry her luggage as she did for Vivian just now. 

""Come with me."" Indifference resonated in Lily's voice as she turned around and walked toward the house. 

On the other hand, Maria didn't say anything. She just quietly followed Lily while carrying her own suitcase. 

In fact, her suitcase gave off a dull sound when its wheels ran over the floor, indicating just how heavy it really was. 

Even so, no one really noticed that Maria casually carried it with one hand and had no trouble with it. 

""This is going to be your bedroom,"" Lily uttered as she stopped in front of a door. 

She took Maria to a room on the first floor. Inside its narrow interior, there was a single bed, a simple wardrobe, and a desk and chair set. There wasn't a lot of furniture in the room, but it already felt so clamped. There was basically no more space for any other stuff. 

Before entering, Maria looked at the stairs leading to the second floor. 

Noticing where her gaze was, Lily sneered and caught her attention. ""This river-view villa district was developed by a real estate enterprise well-known internationally. The internal layout of this three-floor villa is incredibly unique and sophisticated. It can only be built with top-level design skills and artistic structure. Now, you are going to live on the first floor. Do not dare go to the upper floors if you have no business in there. Also, it might be your first time in a place this big, so be careful and try not to get lost. Don't say I didn't warn you.""

Lily's tone was harsh enough to let Maria know that she wasn't trying to hide her contempt towards a bumpkin like her. 

At the same time, the maid indeed wasn't exaggerating about the size of the place. When she first came to the Jenkins family, Lily had lost her way several times in the passageways around the villa. One time, she even entered the master's bathroom completely by mistake. 

If it weren't for her excellent cooking skills that helped her win Vivian's favor, she would have been fired a long time ago. 

""Yeah, I do know something about such villas."" Maria replied calmly, shifting her gaze towards the room in front of her. 

""You do? Ha!""

Lily snorted so hard as though she heard a distasteful joke. 

Maria was nothing more than an ordinary girl from a small town near the countryside, a mere substitute for Vivian's engagement. Now, she was claiming that she understood how complicated and exquisite the structure of the villa was. Of course, Lily found it laughable. 

In fact, it wasn't until recently that she heard from another maid in a neighboring villa about the history of the river-view villa district. Its design was created by a mysterious and low-key top-level designer, and it was obtained by a real estate enterprise at a remarkably steep price. 

It was said that the top-level designer was unwilling to take the job at first. However, she happened to be in urgent need of money, so she eventually agreed to do this. 

Unexpectedly, the designer finished all the intricate designs and layouts in just a day. 

Considering that she finished the job so fast, the head of the real estate enterprise suspected that her work was perfunctory. He complained to many people and even claimed that the designer was a scammer who tried to ask for a huge amount of money for a lackluster output. In other words, he tried to discredit her abilities. 

About three months later, however, a world-famous design competition bestowed a Gold Award on the designer's works. Apparently, her genius was undoubtedly genuine. 

In order to save face, the head of the estate enterprise immediately issued a public apology. Unfortunately for him, when he tried to contact the designer personally for a new project, he learned that he and his company were already blacklisted. 

In the age where this kind of news could quickly circulate around the Internet, the design circle soon learned that the designer embargoed the company. As a result, many other famous designers refused to cooperate with them from then on. 

Eventually, the head and his company incurred extremely heavy losses that he had to leave the real estate industry and test his luck somewhere else. 

""Anyway, please remember to stay in your room at all times. I will call you when it's time to eat. More importantly, don't make any noise in your room. I am staying in the room next to yours, and I have been having troubles sleeping properly recently. I don't want to be awakened from my rest just because you're making unnecessary ruckus in your room! Do you understand?"" Lily raised an eyebrow and crossed her arms in front of her chest. 

Maria could only smile mirthlessly. It was clear that her new identity as the lady of the Jenkins family didn't have any authority at all. 



  Cooking Noodles

Unbeknownst to everyone, Maria had narcolepsy. 

In fact, she also didn't bother saying this to her new family. 

But because of this disease, she had the tendency to sleep more than the normal duration. Sometimes, it could even go up to twenty-four hours. 

When Maria had a narcolepsy attack, she wouldn't be able to prevent herself from sleeping on the spot. This meant that she could be prone to accidents or even suffocation. 

This was why the consequences of her condition could be fatal. 

Unfortunately, Maria had a relapse soon after she moved in with the Jenkins family. 

She was only supposed to take a nap, but when she woke up, it was already eight o'clock in the evening. 

No one came and tried to wake her up. Hence, Maria wasn't able to have dinner. 

""Lily, is there anything else to eat? I overslept, and now I'm hungry.""

Maria found Lily in the living room, so she asked her for some food. 

""Oh, you're finally up. I thought you're not going to wake up anymore!""

Lily said sarcastically. 

""Anyway, Mr. Jenkins has taken Miss Jenkins to a concert, so they won't be home until later tonight. Besides cooking, I also have to deal with all the other house chores. You missed dinner, but it's not my fault. Don't expect me to cook for you now. There are noodles, vegetables, and some meat in the fridge. You're from the countryside, right? I believe even you should be able to cook a noodle dish for yourself.""

For someone who also came from a poor family, Lily thought that a bumpkin like Maria should at least know how to cook. 

After all, they had no one else to rely on but themselves. 

On the other hand, Maria couldn't help but look at Lily, who said that she was busy with the house chores. 

Despite what she said, she was actually sitting on the sofa and watching a drama show on TV with a huge bowl of popcorn. 

Upon seeing the maid munching, Maria could only roll her eyes hard. Only a fool would believe Lily's words. 

""It's okay. I'll make something for myself.""

Left with no choice, Maria went straight to the kitchen. 

Looking at her receding figure, Lily smiled complacently. 

""Do this fake daughter of Mr. Jenkins really think that she can boss me around? I don't think so!"" Lily scoffed coldly, mumbling to herself. 

She thought that only the true members of the Jenkins family were qualified to treat her as a helper around the house. After all, she and Maria should have only come from the same background. 

After a while, Lily started to hear some noises coming from the kitchen. 

It was the sound of vegetables being cut quickly and skillfully. She couldn't help but furrow her brows. Although she couldn't see it in person, she somehow wondered if Maria was actually more skilled at cooking than her. 

""Ha! Impossible!"" Lily took pride in her cooking. After all, it was the main reason why she was still in this household. 

But a few minutes later, a spectacular fragrance spread out from the kitchen. 

The moment Lily took a whiff of it, she couldn't stop herself from swallowing hard. 

What was Maria cooking? 

How on earth could a simple noodle dish smell this good? 

Lily's eyes narrowed, assuming that Maria might have had a unique recipe. That was why even a simple dish could smell so appetizing. 

""If I can learn it, the Jenkins family will be more satisfied with my cooking. Then, maybe they will decide to give me a raise!""

Lily almost drooled in excitement. She couldn't wait to make it come true. 

Therefore, she went to the dining room and waited patiently for Maria to come out. When she heard the footsteps coming from the kitchen, she put on her brightest smile. 

""Are you done? What did you cook? Let me have a look—""

It was Lily's first time acting kindly towards Maria, but the smile on her face was replaced with disappointment and confusion when she saw Maria came out of the kitchen without bringing anything. 

""Noodles,"" Maria answered without any hint of interest in her eyes. 

""Yeah, I know. But where is it?"" Lily asked, her tone getting a little impatient. 

""I already ate everything. I told you I was hungry."" Lily's face froze upon hearing this. On the other hand, Maria just walked past her and went to the front door. ""I'm just going out for a walk and have some fresh air.""

Lily didn't answer back, and she only regained her senses when Maria closed the door after going out. 

She badly wanted to know Maria's secret recipe, but she was too proud to ask her directly. Instead, she thought of going to the kitchen to see if there were any clues left behind. 

Unfortunately for her, Maria washed the dishes she used after she ate. The kitchen was as spotless as before. Everything was the same, except for the lingering satisfying smell of the noodle dish. 

""Humph! I can still ask her next time. I don't believe she will dare hide it from me deliberately!"" Lily was obviously dissatisfied. 

At the same time, even though a long time already passed, the exquisite aroma still wafted around the villa. 

After a while, the front door opened again, but it was Vivian who entered. She and her father had just returned from the concert. 

""Wow! What is that? It smells so good!""

Vivian's eyes widened in delight as she looked at Lily. 

""Lily, what did you cook? May I please have some?""

Lily didn't know what to say. She thought that admitting that the sensational aroma actually came from the noodle dish cooked by Maria would make her lose face. 

""Oh, that? I got a little hungry, so I cooked some noodles earlier. However, I've already finished all of it. There's nothing left."" Although, it wasn't very noticeable, Lily's face flushed red in embarrassment. 

""Then go and cook some more for me! I can wait!"" Vivian ordered at once. 

Hearing this, Lily was stunned. She realized that she didn't think her answer thoroughly. 

Now, she was in a huge dilemma, and she also made a fool of herself. 

Of course, she could still cook Vivian a noodle dish. But it wouldn't be as appetizing as the one cooked by Maria. Then, she would be caught lying. 

But before Lily could answer again, a dignified and aloof lady came in and patted Vivian on the shoulder. 

""It's so late already. No midnight snacks.""

Vivian could only let out a disappointed sigh. Then, she answered reluctantly, ""Alright, mom...""



Lies Of Masters

This was Vivian's mother, Julie Jenkins. 

She entered the house, wearing an elegant dress and gorgeous makeup, yet she had this cold expression on her face. As she looked around, her eyes narrowed as they caught something displeasing. 

There was an evident frown on her face the moment she saw the bowl of popcorn on the coffee table and some even on the carpet, as if some barbaric person without manners lived there. 

""Is it you?""

Noticing the disgust in the hostess's tone, Lily panicked and decided to pass the blame. After all, she wouldn't want to incur the wrath of the Jenkins family. ""No, ma'am... Maria left them there.""

Hearing Maria's name, Julie remembered that there was now a new daughter in the household of the Jenkins family. 

""She just left her trash there? Where is that girl now?""

Julie raised an eyebrow, and her annoyance just grew even more. Her first impression of the adopted daughter was instantly shattered just because of Lily's selfish lies. 

Swallowing hard, Lily almost stammered, ""Mrs. Jenkins, a-after eating... the popcorn... Maria said that she will go out for a walk.""

Julie shook her head and didn't want to hear any more. She then turned to her husband with a disapproving expression. ""Are you hearing this? How could a young girl go out this late at night alone? Bill, have you really thought this through? the girl you took back may become the disgrace of our family!""

With a long face, Bill sighed and nodded. ""You're right. I will lay some ground rules for her. She can't do whatever she wants to just like that.""

After exchanging a few more words to express their disappointment, the couple went back to their bedroom on the second floor. 

""Hey, Lily! Remember to cook that noodle dish for me next time, okay?""

Vivian reminded Lily unhappily before also going back to her room on the third floor. 

Meanwhile, on the riverside, the scenery looked very beautiful. The river glimmered with dotted lights, and the water's flow sounded so calming. 

This was indeed a high-end villa district. Even though it was her first time in this new environment, Maria didn't worry about her safety at all. 

The Jenkins family didn't know that aside from the self-assembled laptop, Maria also had a mobile phone. 

It was pure black in color, and like her laptop, the brand trademark wasn't present. It looked almost like a cheap knockoff phone she bought for two dollars from a thrift store. 

But even though it wasn't branded, in terms of functionality and security, this mobile phone far exceeded almost all of the commercially available ones. 

The top-level hackers of Heaven were issued with this special mobile phone that they could use in their jobs. Through this device, they could access the latest information and data in Heaven's database at any time. 

At this time, while Maria enjoyed the tranquil surroundings, she opened her mobile phone and sent a message to the chat room of Heaven's members. 

There was only one sentence, but it instantly caused a massive uproar. She said, ""I'll be suspending all my business transactions from here on.""

""What?! Master M! Why will you stop taking job requests? I just got a big order from a top-500 enterprise. They need to rebuild their internal network. I was hoping you could do it. No one wants to accept it because the job request is so demanding!""

""Of course, this is just temporary, right? When are you returning, Master M?""

""I also have many clients who are specifically asking for you.""

""Hmm... That's so sudden. Let me guess... Master M, have you fallen in love with someone? Oh, what a lucky guy!""

Actually, the only information that Maria let them know was her gender. Aside from that, her identity was a complete enigma. 

""What are you guys saying? I have just graduated from high school. I don't have time yet for trivial things such as love. Anyway, there's also a chance that I may not continue studying in the future. I have recently moved to Sheffield to start my new life here.""

Maria didn't want to be lied to, so she also had no intention of doing it. 

However, not because she told the truth meant that everyone would believe her. In fact, most of them thought that it was just an excuse. 

""Ha-ha! Master M, that's too much. Did you say that you just graduated from high school? So, you mean that I, a doctor who graduated from a prestigious university, was destroyed by a high-school student in Heaven's hacking competition three years ago? That's just ridiculous!""

""Didn't Master Night also do this last time? He said that he will suspend his business because he was hospitalized due to a car accident, and he needed time to recuperate.""

""Oh, right. I remember that! The following day after Master Night announced his supposed hiatus, an overseas hacker attacked us. But out of nowhere, Master Night dealt with it without much effort. If it weren't for that hacker, we would have fallen for Master Night's brilliant ruse!""

""I agree! It's just to be expected that even at deceptions, the masters are very good!""

""Ha-ha! I think I know this. Women may have issues with their age. So it's kind of like 30 never, 18 forever! Am I right, Master M?""

While Maria read the messages at the chat room, she could only shake her head lightly while letting out a faint smile. Although they were not familiar with each other on a personal level, they made her feel a sense of warmth and belonging. 

""Welcome to Sheffield.""

Maria's brows slightly furrowed as she received a private message. 

Upon checking the ID of the sender, it turned to be from Night. 

Like Maria, he was one of the divine-level hackers in Heaven, known as Master Night. 

""Oh, thanks."" But then after thinking for a while, Maria found it to be weird. So, she added, ""Does that mean that you believe me? But none of the others do.""

Meanwhile, in the Wilson family's residence in Sheffield, a man in a wheelchair was holding the same black mobile phone that the hackers from Heaven were also using. 

Then, he sent another message addressed to Maria. 

""Well, yes. I believe whatever you say.""",1,1755026253.0,u_WeakResult6194,0,1.0,False

1moi05q,https://i.redd.it/2765hvde1nif1.png,I Became His Mistress's Living Blood Donor in Disguise,"Chapter 1

My husband left his childhood sweetheart, insisting on marrying me, and I believed he loved me. It wasn't until a car accident claimed my child that I uncovered his secret. Parker married me to exploit my blood to save the child he had with Melina Jacobs. All those post-wedding hospital visits weren't for my care—they were to turn me into a living blood bank for his and his true love's child. Well, if that's the case, then let me support you both.

I sat in the car, my body trembling in disbelief as I listened to the recording from the dashcam. It captured a conversation between Parker and his assistant a month ago—just weeks before I lost my baby in that car accident. After five years of marriage, I finally understood why I had frequently ended up in the hospital after mysterious fainting spells and injuries. My blood type was the perfect match for the child he had with another woman.

The icy wind outside the car window was tame compared to the chill I felt inside. Memories flooded over me like a storm—five years of endless accidents. Car crashes, muggings, fires... Even when there were no ""accidents,"" Parker would tell me during hospital visits, ""Isabel, the doctor says you're weak from stress and injuries. You need frequent check-ups."" And it was always at his family's private hospital. Because of this supposed ""fragility,"" Parker accompanied me to every appointment, every single time.

I had been moved by his apparent devotion, believing he cared deeply for me. He never missed a hospital visit and was always at my side. But now, I realized he was just making sure his living blood bank didn't escape. He had to watch me until he personally oversaw my blood being sent to his child with Melina Jacobs.

I had wondered why he suddenly insisted on marrying me despite his long history with Melina. Now it was clear. He wasn't interested in me, just the blood running through my veins. Unable to contain my emotions any longer, tears began to fall. For the sake of Melina and their child, he didn't hesitate to cause my miscarriage, as long as the child received the blood.

Parker left me in the car, claiming he was buying my favorite strawberry cake. I watched him in the distance, wearing his sharp suit, waiting in line. Then I looked at the phone on the driver's seat and hesitantly picked it up. The wallpaper was still our wedding photo, and the password was my birthday. But now, it all felt like a cruel joke.

I opened his messaging app, and at the top wasn't me. He had saved Melina under the affectionate nickname ""Lina."" I checked Melina's profile and found her birthday. Amazingly, using it, I accessed Parker's private photo album. The pictures inside felt like a punch to the gut—each one documenting Melina and her child. In contrast, photos of me were scarce.

I flipped through the chat history from a month ago, ""Parker, Teo needs a blood transfusion."" Without a moment's hesitation, he replied, ""I'll arrange a car accident for her to miscarry, then we can safely give Teo the blood.""

The scene made my body shake uncontrollably. How could his heart be so callous? And how blind and pitiful was I? Tears spilled down my face, unstoppable. I pressed my trembling hand to my abdomen. On the day of my miscarriage, Parker held me, pretending sorrow, telling me we’d have children again.

Every ounce of what I thought was love felt painfully ironic now. I looked up and saw Parker approaching with the cake, quickly wiping my tears, putting the phone back, and pretending nothing had happened. He got into the car, sensing something was off with me. ""Isabel? What's wrong? You seem upset.""

Feigning calm, I replied, ""Nothing, I'm just a bit cold.""

He didn’t suspect anything, quickly opening the cake and handing me a cup of hot coffee. ""Here, take this to warm your hands."" I forced a bitter smile as he fed me cake with a spoon. ""Is it good?""

I nodded, forcing a smile, ""Delicious."" But no amount of sweetness could mask the bitterness in my heart. I would no longer be this ""living blood bank."" Parker, if you love Melina so much, then go ahead. I'll step aside for you both.",0,1755026055.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,5,0.5,False

1mohzpt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mohzpt,My 3D Printing Espresso Hack: From Annoying Grinder Fumbles to a Magnet-Powered Dosing Cup Holder That Saved My Local Cafe's Sanity,"I've been deep into the world of espresso and 3D printing for about a year and a half now, and I just had to share this project that's been a game-changer for my favorite local roaster. It all started with my own frustration at home—I use a DF64 grinder, and even with the rubber adapter from Turin, getting the dosing cup perfectly lined up felt like a precision surgery every time. One slip, and grounds everywhere. I hated the workflow, so I decided to design a custom holder that would make it effortless.

The idea? Leverage the grinder's natural vibration and a slight tilt in the holder to auto-center the cup as it fills. I kept it super close to the chute to cut down on ejected grounds flying all over the place. And for easy cleaning (because who wants coffee dust buildup?), I went with a blind mount system—no exposed screws or crevices for grounds to hide in.

Then I visited the cafe and saw their baristas wrestling with the standard forks on their DF83 grinder. It was chaos during rush hour, so I adapted my design for them. My first version used friction-fit slide rails, but it was a bit fiddly to remove for cleaning, which they do religiously. Enter magnets! I redesigned it to snap on magnetically—quick attach, easy detach. While I was there, I noticed their Turin dosing cups already had magnets built-in. Lightbulb moment: Why not embed a covered magnet in the print itself for perfect self-centering alignment? It just clicks into place every time. Plus, magnets are just cool—who doesn't love that satisfying snap?

Printed it in PLA (tough enough for daily abuse, easy to clean), and after a few test iterations (shoutout to the failed prints that looked like abstract art), I handed it over. Checked back a couple days later, and the baristas were over the moon. No more fiddling with dosing collars or eyeballing the forks—just drop the cup in, grind, and go. It's streamlined their routine big time, especially during those morning rushes.

Has anyone else hacked their grinder setup like this? I'd love to hear your stories or ideas—maybe it'll inspire my next iteration!",1,1755026027.0,espresso,4,0.67,False

3 days ago (Sunday), I found a commercial space. So I talked to the owner and he agreed to show me the place the same day. So after showing me around, I said na I liked the place and perfect sya sa plano kong itayong business (gaming hub w/ coffee shop). So napag usapan namin yung rental fees and terms, and sabi ko okay naman sakin kasi pasok sa budget ko yung inoffer nya after a little negotiation sa price. Then sabi nya eh ipapaprepare na daw nya sa attorney nya yung contract and he will send me a copy by Monday night, which he did. So Tuesday nagpunta ako sa bank to open a checking account, kasi ang usapan is via post dated checks ang pagbabayad ng rent, and he wanted me to send pics of 13 checks (1 for the 2months deposit + 1 month advance, and the other 12 checks are for the monthly rent for 1 year). So after ko nareview yung contract (Tuesday Morning), parang di ako 100% sure kasi parang need ko pa pag aralan mabuti yung terms/clauses na nilagay nya dun. Then now na few hours away na lang before yung agreed contract signing namin (8am Wednesday), nag message ko sa kanya na I am backing out kasi parang masyadong mabilis yung pace namin. Parang wala masyadong time pag isipan mabuti yung pipirmahan kong kontrata sa kanya, while considering dun sa other stuff na need ko asikasuhin like suppliers, permit, etc.

So I just want to ask for expert opinions especially from those matagal nang nagbubusiness if unethical ba yung ginawa ko to cancel on the day of our agreed contract signing meeting? Kasi parang I wasted his valuable time din dahil sa pagcancel ko bigla. Thank you! 🙏🏽",0,1755025936.0,BusinessPH,0,0.33,False

1mohxin,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mohxin/sabotaged_my_friends_relationship_because_he_made/,Sabotaged my friend's relationship because he made me lose grades.,"I am in my second year of college, and we had an internal project that was worth 8% of our final grades.  
I had worked hard for my stuff, days, researching and polishing my project, because I do care about my grades a lot. My college isn't good enough, so I need to work on my stuff to get a job.  
Now, there's my friend, let's call him RM, because he's my roommate, is in the same class with me, and have the same professors. It was inevitable that we were so close to each other.  
He is the type to not care much about his grades, because his father's a local businessman, and he is doing this degree just for the sake of it, unlike me, who's very middle class and my career depends on this.  
On the last day of our deadline, RM, without any consideration 'borrowed' my laptop, and without my knowledge, took my project, shared it to himself, made barely any changes to the code, and submitted it.  
Obviously, our professor caught onto this 'plagiarism' and without letting me explain myself and both our projects were flagged, rejected and both were given a 0 for that.

I confronted RM about this, and he apologized. I know he might not have actively sabotaged me because he's just that dumb, but I couldn't let this go. I was pissed beyond reason.  
But since he apologized, I couldn't escalate this stuff.   
I didn't fight, I didn't yell, I just... 'let it go.'  
Except I didn't.

See, RM had this good stage with a girl from another major, AM. They weren't official but it was heading that way. She dropped by our room sometimes, go on for late night coffees, lots of inside stuff in their Instagram. Anyone could tell they both were way into each other.

I had a plan.

I waited for a week before I started executing it.   
We guys have our GC with like 16 people, and it's all close friends and 'same set of people'. You know, 'guy jokes', which obviously are not very SFW and might even be very weird if taken without context or 'humor'.  
I took screenshots of all the weird stuff he talked about, stuff he talked about AM too, like passing comments on her body and stuff, and saved it all.  
I made a burner account with fake IP, email, and took many measures to make sure it don't trace back to me, and I came into contact with her in the DMs.

“Hey, I know you and RM are talking, so I thought you should see what he talks about and how he talks about others. I used to be close to him, but this just rubbed me the wrong way and I felt I should just give you a warning.” \[Attached Photos\]

I sent it to her, deleted everything, cleaned my phone and made no further effort. I already did what I had to.

As expected, for the next few days, RM was stressed, constantly on his phone, calls and messages. I could guess what was happening.  
Slowly, she stopped ignoring him, blocked his contacts and handles, and RM was so confused about the entire stuff.

He started going bazooka in the GC, yelling at everyone about who was the snitch, personally meeting everyone, including me, and at one point, he left the GC.  
Since he was my roommate, he often vented to me, since I was 'clear of all suspicions', and I always made sure he stays frustrated, by giving him vague, dry and stupid responses like, ""Let it go, man"", ""Girls are like that"" and yada yada.

He never figured it out. I was never caught.

He was affected with this so much that his grades tanked even further and he barely made it to the next semester.

Was I petty? Yes. Was it childish? Maybe.  
But was it worth it? For me, heck yeah.

Speeds stayed solid for normal browsing, streaming, and even working on big Google Drive files. But I also found out it doesn’t really hide your location in the same way a VPN does. For example, some sites still gave me local search results, and when I tried watching a US-only streaming show, it just didn’t work.

Tragedy had struck. One of the three remaining sleds had capsized. Its driver, one Jim Bishops of San Diego, was still unaccustomed to handling dog sleds. San Diego of course has no snow. And even the snowy places he was used to, including the great towering mountains of the Sierra Nevada do not have need of dog sleds. One corner taken slightly too fast by the inexperienced driver was all that was necessary to cause tragedy. A tipped sled on its own constitutes reprimand but little else. This tipped sled however was carrying the injured patriarch of this venture and its namesake, Reagus Van Brewer. He was none too pleased to be thrown out of his warm cocoon and into the snow. Nor was he pleased about the two dogs that were crushed by the overturned sled. An overturned sled that at that moment had come to rest its considerable weight on the foot of its driver Mr. Bishops. 

Reagus cursed as he untangled himself from the multiple blankets that encased him. “You’ve done it this time Bishops! First you get me skewered by that accursed elk and now you try to finish off what ya started by tossin me out da GOD DAMNED SLED!”

Mr. Bishops for his part, as the hunting expert of this trip, had attempted to pull Van Brewer out of the way of the charging elk. An elk that Van Brewer had gotten far too close to. Against the pleading of Bishops and The Captain. No good deed goes unpunished, they say. Bishops was not listening to Brewers however, he was quite preoccupied by the searing pain coursing through his foot. Sweat beaded on Bishop's forehead from the pain. Pooling on his eyebrows and dripping, half frozen onto the canvas of the sled or smashing little craters into the snow by his ruined foot.
“You’ve killed Angness!” cried Milton. A sinewy short Scotsman who cared for no man but a great deal for his furry companions. “Damn the Dog!” yelled Bishops through gritted teeth. “And damn you too Brewers you big blithering idiot. Can’t you men see? It crushed my bloody foot!” The captain was next to the scene. Stoic disappointment gracing his face. A doctor going into the surgery of a man he’d warned to stop playing with fire. Countless lessons in sled driving had turned to not. While Bishops was undoubtedly the most experienced hunter in the group, as well as being a weathered outdoorsman he’d taken to dog sleds like oil to water. The proverbial chickens had indeed come home to roost. The captain and Mr. Milton with the assistance of two of the native guides managed to lift the sled and pull Bishops from underneath it. Brewers watched citing “injury” as reason for lack of participation. The snow had mixed with blood in a slurry of frozen gore. The bodies of the two lifeless dogs seemed to stare up at Bishops. Cursing him for his inexperience. One scotts terrier the other a large soup hound of unknown lineage.  “Let's get that boot off Mr Bishops so we can have a gander.” said The Captain. The Captain was the affectionate nickname for Nicholas Fink, retired army Colonel, mountaineer and leader of this merry band of hunters. Van Brewer was financier of the Reagus hunting expedition. But he was no leader. Anyone with enough money can pay a group of ten men $250 a week to help him bag an elk in the Yukon but money does not buy respect or leadership ability. The Captain had large amounts of both. When Bishops pulled off his boot, which took nearly five minutes from the pain, the sight was less than invigorating. The blade of the sled had split his foot almost in two across the crown. Toes dangled limply, brushing the bottom of his heel. It made a terrible sucking, thrump-ing sound when the boot finally came free. “Welp, I think you’re about done in son. May serve you right for killin poor Agness.” 
“Enough Mr Milton!” The Captain barked. Then they set about the painfull business of setting Bishop's broken foot. This was frontier medicine. A shot of brandy and a good leather belt to bite acted as anesthetic. Raising the free swinging half of Bishops’ foot The Captain placed it in more or less its original spot. Milton had retrieved a needle and thread, normally used for repairing the leather dog harnesses, he began to sew together the two halves of Bishops’ foot. The captain held him as he screamed. Reagus Van Brewer, supposed expeditionary and self proclaimed “Tuff Guy” found a place not far from the action to deposit his breakfast. Much debate was had of whether or not the whole foot should just be removed. Bishops would not hear of this however. He was going to keep that damned foot even if it killed him.
He was in a bad way. More than the injury itself it spelt doom for him. He couldn’t stand behind the sled nor could he run alongside like the rest of the men. Brewers wasn't going to give up his spot on the sled. And the other two carried nonnegotiable supplies.
Bishops sat on a log a little ways from their impromptu camp. Looking into the distance and contemplating his problems. The pain of the ordeal had raised his temperature. He’d removed his oversized, black dyed shearling coat, a signature of his, and was sitting on it.
“Well Bishops, I think I’ve got a bit of a plan for you.” The Captain said, walking up. “But I’m afraid you’re not gonna like it.” “Just tell me.” Jim’s face was a pale green from the recent “surgery”. “There's a cabin not far from here near Strider Gap. It's not much but its weather tight and should have a big supply of firewood. I stayed there back in 98’ when I thought I was gonna strike it rich. I’d gotten stuck in a late winter blizzard and that cabin’s the only reason I’m sittin here beside ya.” 
“So you’re going to leave me there?” 

“Don’t say it like that. Not forever. Just you know…for the winter.”

“The WINTER?!”

“Yes Jim the winter. There's only about two months left till snow melt anyway. We’ve got to get old Van Brewers whiny ass back to Whitehorse asap. Otherwise I’m afraid none of us, including you, will get paid!” He emphasized this with a finger to the chest.

Bishops looked off towards the tree line. 

“Look Jim.” Said The Captain, this time with a more conciliatory tone. “It’ll only be for around six weeks at most…As soon as we get old whiny britches back to Whitehorse I’ll turn around to come getcha.”  
“You’d better promise! And bring my check with ya. I don’t trust the rat bastard Reagus to not disappear on me. Gonna end up spending it all fixing this damned foot.”
The Captain laid a hand on Bishops’ shoulder. “Jim, I promise. Like no promise I’ve ever made before imma come getcha.” They shared a long look. Jim nodded. “Shame about those dogs though. I hope old Milty knows it weren’t on purpose. I always had a soft spot for that mutt.” 
The captain was shaking his head before Jim had even finished. “Now don’t you go worryin about Mr Milton or any dog. You’ve got lots of healin to do. Tell me something before we getcha up to the cabin. Did the president really give you that coat?” 
This brought a grin to Bishops. “Yes sir.” 
“Bullshit!” 
“It's true I swear!  Just as I told Jakey and the boys a few nights back. It was a gift for hunting with him in africa. See it dyed black on account of the fact we were hunting Cape Buffalo. I recounted the whole thing in a book. Didn’t sell real well.” The Captain smiled. “Looks like I’ve got some reading to do. You and Teddy Roosevelt huh? What a thing.” The Captain stood shaking his head in mock disbelief. “Well, I tell ya this James Bishops. I won’t let this accursed trip be the end of your story. I’m coming back for ya. In six weeks. I'll be here, as sure as the snow falls I’ll be here.”
That conversation was seven weeks ago…


Bishops sat at the end of the pine needle mattress and took stock of his supplies. He chewed on the corner of his wiry overgrown mustache. It wasn’t good. One pound of flour, a quarter pound of bacon, one small grubby handful of coffee, half pound of sugar, one pint jar of beef tallow, some dried elk jerky, two elk flank steaks and a half pound of dried figs… He’d rationed appropriately but it wasn’t enough. He hobbled over to the fire and threw in another log. Luckily The Captain and Mr Milton were kind enough to stay an extra day, much to Brewers chagrin, and set the whole crew to chop wood for him. The nights had been brutally cold but he’d rationed the wood too. Between what was already there and the efforts of the Reagus expedition, nearly two and a half cords of the stuff still sat under the front porch. But the food. The food would be a problem… The Captain was supposed to be back last Monday if Bishop’s date keeping was at all accurate. Far past when the food supplies were to run out. Although, there had been a stretch of what felt like two weeks or more where the sun didn’t rise at all. Or if it had Jim was not awake to see it. He’d struggled with day keeping then and for all he knew could be off by more than a week. This is what he told himself. The Captain was on his way. He had to be. He’d promised and The Captain always kept his promises. 
But food. The ever present pang of empty pain went through his stomach. It was being drowned out more and more each day however. The now rotting foot was becoming a worthy rival for his starvation when it came to the pain department. His foot had been healing rather well all things considered. Until the fifth week of his isolation. Jim had decided that it was time, the thick, ugly stitches Mr Milton had sewed him up with, needed to be removed. He’d pulled out his buck knife. Slowly and with shaking hands, placed the tip under the tight threads of each stitch and drew the knife upwards causing the stitch to rip. Then he grabbed the loose end and pulled it back through the tawny flesh. He repeated this for all twelve stitches. And it was going quite well. Jim had just made some off-handed comment to himself about not knowing “Why doctors get paid so much.” When the knife slipped. Just as the sled before, in an instant it had all gone wrong. The tip of the buck went forward carried by Bishops’ weight and it cut him deep. Straight between the bones of his big toe and its companion. The cold steel wrecked all the new flesh his belligerent body had spent the last five weeks growing. The meticulously kept blade went all the way through the foot until its sparkling tip poked out the bottom. He screamed. If anyone had been around to hear it they may have described it as unearthly. An auditory glimpse into hell. But it was late winter in the Yukon. There was no one to hear. 
Now some two weeks later, it had begun to stink. And was far too swollen to put back into the boot. He’d bound it with strips of fabric and fashioned a makeshift crutch from a sapling. He hobbled on it now. He was thinking of food. Caribou or elk or a God Damned rabbit it didn’t matter. He had a gun and needed to kill something made of meat.
He grabbed his oversized black dyed shearling coat from its hook near the door and swung it over his shoulders. It didn’t fit nearly as well as it once had. He fairly swam in it. The thing had always been too big for him but now he looked like a child who’d raided his father's wardrobe. His once broad shoulders were weak and pointed. The skin around his middle was shrink wrapped around his ribs which looked as though with one breath too deep they’d poke right through his papery flesh and he’d deflate like a balloon. 
No hunting for today though. He stumbled over to the fireplace and scrawled another hash mark into the soft hearthstone with his knife. Another day, still no sign of rescue. 
Sleep was an uncomfortable endeavor. Loose and fitful it evaded him like a mature buck. Wise to the ways of those who hunted it. He dreamed of a large black beast. It had visited him every night since he’d reopened his wounded foot. The dream was simple and always the same. The beast sat just outside the cabin door. It talked to him in the voices of loved ones or that of The Captain. First politely asking then begging and screaming to be let in. It was cold. Way was he being so heartless? It would be so easy to let it in. Bishops was cold too. This beast would bring warmth and food, if only he would open the door. But no matter the silky words or incessant scratching and crying, Bishops held fast in his dream scap. Curled up by the fire he held his rifle close sobbed. Often dreams and reality seemed to scramble. He’d awakened many times curled up by the fire, gun in hand the salty tang of tears fresh on his tongue. And three days ago there had been deep scratch marks on the door.

It was morning now. Or at least he assumed it was. No light to indicate. The internal clock that all persons are born with was running behind. Slow and clicking it was in desperate need of a rewinding. He stumbled around in the dark until he found his rifle. 
He held it in his right hand. His left padded the coat pockets for cartridges. Five left. Three fewer than last night. He’d awaken in the dark. This alone wasn’t unusual. The sun came up for barely an hour these days. When it was up it only slightly crested the horizon. Scattering pale orange sunlight before being swallowed up once more by the near eternal darkness.
But no. When Bishops had awakened it was to the sound of scratching from outside. He peered out the single glass pain that acted as window above his bed. He saw…was that a rabbit? N,o a fully grown hare! And a big one at that. He’d raced outside with the rifle, putting too much weight on the injured foot which cracked and pulsed in protest. In the light of a half full moon dog. Jim, a crack shot, put three rounds in the damned thing. The hare sat quite unbothered. As though he hadn’t just been shot thrice by a .338 elk rifle. Jim squinted. He stumbled over to the hair which still didn’t move. Upon reaching it, the unsettling truth of the matter made itself known. The “hare” was in fact a stump. The stump of the sapling he’d cut down to make his crutch.
This incident was still fresh in Bishops’ mind as he handled the rounds and loaded one into the rifle. 
The sun would only be up for an hour or so. He’d have to make it count. 
Bishops grabbed a roll of cotton twine from near the fire. He attached one end to the door and held the roll in his hand. This was an old trapper trick he learned from The Captain. It was normally used with a rope to find your way back to the cabin from the barn or shitter in a blizzard but it could work very well in this circumstance. He could now leave the cabin before it was light out and return after dark. This way he could maximize his daylight hunting hours. The key would be to not lose hold of the twine. He picked a direction. Not of knowledge but out of instinct. He thought he’d remembered seeing a large clearing not far from the cabin when they’d first arrived. With any luck he was headed the right way. After going what he thought was at least a hundred yards. In reality it was less than fifty. He stopped in a small clearing and waited. Soon the sun peeked through the tops of the trees. The sun was supposed to bring life and warmth. This sun held neither for him. It was cold and pale. Devoid of all its usual traits. Even the very sun was powerless against the winter and its wrath. Jim missed the sun in San Diego. There you had to be careful with the sun. Its strength was so great that it would burn your skin and blister your feet. He wished for any heat now. He’d gladly be sunburnt head to toe if it meant he could leave this cold god forsaken frozen wasteland. As he waited he remembered the sunny days of summer's past. He would lug his typewriter out to the beach. People watching, as he recounted on paper his various adventures. He’d met Julie on one of those days. She walked by with a group of friends. Tanned skin glistening as she flaunted the new “california” style of bathing suit. One that left little in the way of imagination. Shared glances soon turned to stares and before long Jim was making his way over to the ladies. Eyes only for one. “Well what's a place like you doing in a girl like this?” His fumbling of this phrase while unintentional provoked a short laugh from her. What a beautiful sound he’d thought. “Well what I mean is, um I guess I wish to ask what your name is?” “Julie.” She said it through a brilliant smile. Eyes sparkling the green blue of the pacific. “Julie” even her name was delicate and beautiful. He loved the feel of it in his mouth. Sweet like spring cherries. They’d spent one wonderful summer together. Lying naked on the beach in the long sunset hours late August, he told her of an opportunity. One Reagus Van Brewer was offering him $250 a week for an expedition into the Yukon. Since rent doesn’t seem to care if a book was made with passion or with quality. Only if it sells. His hadn’t. The opportunity could not be passed up. Julie begged him to stay with her words and body. Against his heart he didn’t. 
The single hour of sun was nearly up when a breaking of branches pulled him from the white sunbaked beaches of San Diego back to the pale unmoving frozen death of the north. To the far south edge of the clearing a swarm of caribou started to pop out of the trees. Just a few at first but soon there were hundreds. He couldn’t believe his luck. He kept an eye out for a straggler towards the rear. There was always one. There it was. Limping some fifty paces behind the bulk of the herd. He lifted the rifle to his shoulder and breathed slowly. Putting the crosshairs just behind and below the animals front shoulder. He fired. CRAAACK!! The report from the rifle split the air. The herd began to scatter, kicking up tufts of snow in their wake. The caribou dropped. Teddy would have described the shot as “A bully good one!” Or at least that's what Bishops told himself. While he had gone on an african safari with the former president to hunt cape buffalo. And the coat was a gift for a successful hunt. Bishops in his book, conversely to himself and others, had quite exaggerated the extent of their friendship. It seemed he was still doing it. The excitement of the moment was slightly hampered by the realisation that he would have to let go of the twine in order to reach the caribou. The light was fading quickly. He’d nearly decided to go back to the cabin and return in the morning, when a pang of hunger rocked his body. That made up his mind. He released his grip on the twine. 
He set the rifle beside the log he was sitting on. Jim Trudged and limped his way to the caribou. The swollen foot left a line of yellow green pus in the snow as it was dragged. It was dark by the time he reached where he thought the caribou had fallen. But it wasn’t there. It couldn’t have run, his shot was perfect. He’d seen it fall. Thus began a painful and slow search in the dark. Soon he had not only failed to locate his kill but had gotten himself well and truly lost. It was pitch black by now. The anger and frustration had given way to fear. It clutched at his throat and stomach. Sealing off his air, making it hard to breathe. This and in all the stumbling about made his foot pulse with agony. The pain and hunger made him delirious. So, when he heard a crashing sound from the tree line he wasn’t sure if it was real or not. There it was again, only closer. It was big, this noise maker. Jim searched his pockets till he found the little book of matches he kept for emergencies. He lit one. The tiny dancing flame seemed so insignificant in the face of such pure darkness. The noise shifted to a scraping, clawing sound. It was coming closer. He held the match out in front of him and towards the noise. There was now a shape. Taller and broader than any men but unmistakable bipedal. It looked furry. Any features it had were masked by the darkness and the wavering light. Bishops had nearly convinced himself that it was merely a trick of the darkness, when the caribou fell from the figure and crashed to the snowy floor. He caught a glimpse of a huge tear in its throat but the match burnt out. Plunged back into the hellish darkness, and now more afraid than he’d ever been before in his life, Jim Bishops turned and fled. He could hear a strange and poor impression of a female voice calling from behind him. Telling him to wait. He ran as fast as one can with a crutch and one foot. The foot bumped and smacked painfully into every branch, bush and stump on the forest floor. Tears flowed freely from his eyes as he ran. From the pain, regret or the fear it made no difference. He couldn’t help but feel like that thing was trying to mimic the words of a woman. Perhaps more specifically Julie. Impossible. He wouldn’t fall for this deranged attempt to catch him. Eventually his energy reserves were sapped and he collapsed. Dragging himself behind a tree shook and tried to hold still. Anything that could hoist a full grown caribou over its head would have no issue killing him. He was now lost, rifleless, lame and exhausted. 
There was no sound of chasing feet however. No sound at all but the wheezing creaking of his lungs as they desperately grabbed for oxygen. There was a bit of luck though. It was an unusually warm night. Shivering and crying, Bishops stopped and buried his head in the snow. He’d never been so scared. When no strange beast attacked him from the darkness, he curled up in the fetal position and fell asleep. 
He dreamed. Long strange dreams that came in waves. First a dream of fire. He dreamt he crawled towards the edge of a huge bonfire. It cast deathly elongated shadows across the forest floor. The fire was starting to warm his face when suddenly the heat was that of the sun. He was on a beach in San Diego, his home. He could hear the sound of waves crashing on the shore. The salty scent of sea spray filled his nostrils and he was warm. So warm. Like he’d never been cold a day in his life. Warmth traveled through his face and down to his toes. He drank from a coconut and ate a variety of cheeses and meats brought out to him by scantily clad maidens who kissed his cheeks and told him how incredible his book was. They of course had all read it. She was there too. Julie sat with him laying her head on his chest and told him all about the basic goings on of life. This brought a huge grin to his face. And so he smiled in the flesh as well. Face buried in snow and red blue from the cold. He shivered and slept in the starless black of the Yukon night. 

When he awoke it was to the warmth of sunlight on his face. He smiled rolled over. “Oh Julie baby not yet, ten more minutes.” A lightning bolt of fear tore through his body and sat upright. The sun…THE SUN! It was halfway through its arch in the sky and Jim was still lost. He hadn’t been killed so it wasn’t all bad. But being as lost as he was he desperately needed to get back to the cabin. All thought of retrieving the previous night's kill was gone. Priority was on finding his home. Bishops ran. Forgetting for a moment that his foot was crippled. It reminded him soon when he smashed the unresponsive appendage against a large tree stump. It burst. Gray green pus splattered across the snow. Two toes came unstuck and fell clean off the foot. Jim screamed. Not from the pain, for he felt none, but from the sight of his disconnected members lying grey and dead in the white background of snow. He leaned down and picked them up. Putting them in the top pocket of his coat. Something else was there beside his toes. The twine! He could find his way home! Stumbling and falling he slowly, so painfully slowly, made his way across the tundra. Every step was a sisyphean exercise in pain and exhaustion. “One more step!” he told himself as the cold whispered it's easy death to him. When he saw the roof of the cabin in the fading light he began to weep. Frost coated his hair and eyelids.  The exhaustion was clawing at him insisting he give up. It's easier to lay here and let the winter take him. The creature came and sat beside him. The words but he knew it was offering him a choice. More pain. More futile struggle all towards the inevitable. Or easy, warm, comfortable drift into nothing. This thing that would not leave him be. It wanted him. He knew this to be true. Like winter cold and the starving death it wanted him. “Come home!” The words tore out from the shadow beast. They were a twisted version of Julie’s beautiful lilt. It reminded him of the magpies his grandpa had taught to curse when he was a kid. With a huge effort he dragged himself up and stumbled as fast as he could to the cabin door. He could feel the creature's breath against the back of his neck. He reached the door, his frostbitten fingers struggled to lift the latch. When it popped open he fell inside and using his good foot he kicked the door closed behind him. 
He made it! He’d beaten whatever this thing was and he’d beaten the Yukon winter! He screamed his defiance towards the door. The beast raged, beating on the door but it could not come in. He was victorious and so very hungry. Victory is cause for celebration. Celebration means food. He would show the thing his superiority. A bad winner of a high stakes poker game who flaunts his winnings under the noses of the less fortunate. He put his coat back on its hook and began to grab at his food stocks. He made bread. Cooked up all the remaining bacon and ate all the jerky. He stuffed himself and kept back only one steak. Otherwise the remaining supplies from the larder were decimated. He sat exhausted by the now roaring fire. Belly distended, face swelling from drinking the over strong coffee he’d made. His victory meal had left him burping and pissing himself. Grabbing his buck knife from his belt he placed it in its customary spot under his head. Shouting expletives at the beast that still raged outside and screamed in the voice of a woman. 
He didn’t sleep nor was he awake. Any ability to tell reality from dream had abandoned him. It could’ve been a few hours or maybe days when reality finally made inroads to his psyche. The unmistakable stench of decay and rot filled the room. Jim’s head throbbed with pain and his leg was numb to knee. With a look around to gather his bearings, he saw it. Standing near the door, barely visible in the dying light of the coals. Tall, broad and nearly shapeless. The creature had made its way into the cabin somehow. Surely that was what was creating the smell. Bishops shivered and nearly collapsed in on himself from fear. But with the fear came a small cornel of resolve. This wouldn’t be the end of his story. He wouldn’t survive this much only to die at the finish line by some unseen demon from the north. He stood, retrieving the buck knife from under his pillow. Bishops attacked. Leaping towards the shape by the door. The knife sank deep and easily into its hide. They wrestled to the floor. He stabbed it over and over. It wasn’t without a fight though. It bit him. The skin on his wrist opened up. Blood sprayed as the fiery pain glanced through his arm. More stabs as they rolled across the cabin floor and slammed into the fireplace. Jim wouldn’t give up and soon the creature stopped struggling. 
He’d won. Again. James Athony Bishops had conquered this demon's best attempt to kill him. He had won! Killed this evil thing. More than that he killed the winter. All its attempts to drive him mad or starve him had failed. Bishops laid on the floor wheezing from the exertion. He fell into waking dreams. Now he dreamed of San Diego but more so of books. He dreamed of writing down this trip. The president himself came to visit and told Jim just how proud he was. Julie was there now. She kissed his lips, smiling that lovely showstopper of a smile. Her eyes glinted with tears as she held him. “You're home my love. No more need to fight. You’re safe. Sleep.” and with the sun's warm beams upon his face, so he did.

The door to the cabin opened. The Captain was hit with a terrible smell. He’d turned around faster than he ever had before. The four hundred plus mile round trip from strider gap to the Whitehorse and back was done in less than five weeks. He knew James was depending on him and he killed three dogs from exhaustion making his way back. Mr Milton for his part had also come. Feeling bad for the way he had treated Bishops during the accident. They arrived in record time but too late. The Captain looked down at the frozen body of their friend James Bishops. Blood was everywhere. From a large self inflicted knife wound on the wrist. His foot was unrecognizable. The swollen mass of desiccated flesh was a pineapple sized mess of awful. It amazingly still stank despite the cold.
Looking about the cabin they found a message carved into soft brick of the hearthstones. “Tell Julie I’m sorry” 
Jim Bishops’ wrecked body lay in and amongst the tattered ribbons of a once presidential gift. The remains of an oversized black dyed shearling coat…

I also have a resting bitchface/ or at least one that's hard for others to read. Just providing this in the context of my own eye contact.

In my day-to-day, since I don't know many people and am not a part of large social groups in Canada, I usually try to make eye contact with people. Sometimes it's because I've bumped into a stranger in a door way, to which I'll smile and make a joke as I move, sometimes it's in line for a coffee (I just wait and don't look at my phone), and often, it's because I find someone to be cute and I'd just like to smile at them, perhaps in an attempt to start a conversation or maybe just in passing. 

Something that's seems to be frequent, in my experience, is that 99.9% people are like service staff when you want to get their attention... they somehow manage to look in every single direction besides your face/at you, even if you're facing each other or walking by one another.

I've always felt that it was a change across the spectrum with how digital our societies are these days and perhaps with the normalcy now of western cities. Curious to hear other people's perspectives. 

This isn't a post looking for dating advice. I'm genuinely curious about how people perceive eye-contact now from their own experiences and walks of life.

I teach in a school with about 35 staff, and there are two principal's pets who are driving us all off. We've lost six staff members because of them in the last two years. Unfortunately, my decision to leave came after the deadline to submit my resignation or I'd already be gone.


There are a *LOT* of issues with these two women, far too many to list here, but the most recent bullshit is this year's duty roster. Basically, these two women have the ""duty"" to stand outside their classroom doors in the morning and afternoon. That's been their ""duty"" for the last four years. Because they both threw a fit and talked about how much they have to do and how important it is that they not have to go outside in the rain, cold, heat, snow, etc., to direct school bus and drop-off traffic. I get to do that. Three of my coworkers get to do that. Just like we've had to do that the last four years. Even though we've said ""I think we need to put this kind of thing on a rotation."" Even though I live 45 minutes away and can't always arrive at school *early* so I can be in my duty position.


We also have ""WIN"" time, and during ""WIN"" time we have ""freshmen academy."" Basically, the first 20 minutes of the day are devoted to study hall and advising of freshmen, which is great. 10th, 11th, and 12th grade students don't have to arrive until after WIN time unless they need tutoring. And the groups ""loop"" with the same WIN teacher every year. That means the people who had freshmen academy last year *don't have it this year* because their freshmen are now sophomores. But these two threw a fit. One of them said ""I teach *SENIORS*. I don't have time to work with freshmen!"" And she was removed from the rotation so that she could have her extra 20 minutes of planning time every morning instead of working with freshmen. The other one was removed from the rotation so that she could continue to arrive 20 minutes late every day (she's our ""technology integration specialist"" who doesn't do her job), since she's a sycophant who has to spend as much time as possible hanging out at the district office and the local coffee shop. Oh, and because I had *BOTH* freshmen academy *AND* traffic duty, I always had to arrive late every day to 25 unsupervised freshmen standing in the hallway because it takes time to get back to the room when you're coming from outside (but I did love the emails about ""make sure you are standing outside your door before the bell rings!"").

I'm seeking advice on a complex situation i have with one girl with whom I was close 4 years ago. Our connection was deep, there was instant attraction from the moment we met, but I was struggling with significant personal issues (undiagnosed CPTSD, fearful-avoidant attachment style, fear of abandonment due to horrible childhood experience i had, so basically i fucked up by pushing her away due to my fears), and my behavior ended up causing her a lot of pain. I even ended up in the hospital due to medication i was taking at the time. That really stressed her out. She was also working full time job and doing her PhD at the same time and struggled with mental health issues as well. We lost touch completely.

After 4 years of intense therapy and personal growth, I recently wrote her a very honest, sincere letter taking full accountability and expressing my remorse, with no expectation of a response, or anything in return. Our mutual friend passed her the letter as she wanted to read it. To my surprise, she responded very warmly, expressing happiness for my journey and sharing her own. I am now completely different person, actively training bjj, doing gardening, rock climbing, diving, i achieved some major milestones in these 4 years and she is positively responding to those.
Over the next couple of months we started very slowly reconnecting and then we met in person for the first time in years during a group event back in June(a shark release I helped organize). I felt an incredible spark, just like the first time we met. There was great eye contact, natural touching, and when she left, she actually came back to hug me a second time before driving off. She told me after she left that it was super nice to see me again and that she hopes to see me again during summer. We continued texting occassionaly during her holiday (she would be reaching out herself).
Here's where I need advice:
 
Recently, after she came back from a holiday I invited her to meet one-on-one for a coffee and to show her newly hatched shark pups. It would be the first time to meet for a date after 4 years. Her reply was ""Okay, let me see if I can go to your city soon."" I replied with ""Sounds great! Let me know what works the best for you and we'll make it happen."" I know i should probably just offer the date, but i want to give her the space and time for herself to feel she is not being pressured into anything. That was one of the fuck ups i have done before.
 
 However, since that exchange, she has started liking almost every single social media status I post, which she was not doing before, but still no text regarding catching up.

My question is, how do I interpret this? Her words seem cautious, but her actions seem warm (compared to before). Am I misreading this situation completely? Is she just being polite and trying to avoid hurting my feelings, or is she genuinely conflicted and trying to show me that she has positive feelings, even if she's not ready to take the next step?
Any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

""Shut that off"" Kal'tsit growled as she gripped her mug of coffee and nearly cracked it.

""Yes Ma'm"" One of the nearby operators said as they quickly shut off the TV via remote control.

Kal'tsit looked out the window of the Rhode island landship and into the land below. She let out a long and trembling sigh.

""You're certain you lost contact with the Doctor?"" She knew the answer, but she asked anyway.

""Yes. We have not received any signal or conformation's that they are is alive, we have tried and failed to come in contact with them....Their probably.....Gone. We also checked everything and tried to contact any of our operators in Iberia and Aegir's. We got nothing. Same goes to Jammers, mishaps, sabotage, etcetera. Our transmission went through, and no one answered."" The Operator said, peering at the back of Kal'tsit chair. Kal'tsit looked at the now turned off Tv, she stared into the void and it stared back

Kal'tsit didn't like obscurities. She didn't like being blind, left in the dark, or turned unaware. The seaborn attack had come from nowhere and it seemed that it wasn't just going to stop and Iberia and Aegir's. She's was used to pulling the cards on the deck, which was never the case with anyone outside Rhode island. But this took the cake.

All operators inside Aegir's and Iberia were now gone,

""Pull the plug,"" Kal'tsit said calmly . ""Don't let them trace the signal back. If there are any incoming messages from Aegir's, let them through but do not answer, strictly observe and listen to them. If it's important, send it to my desk. I'm not risking anything......Get into contact with all world goverments and warn them that this invasion won't just stop at Iberia and Aegir's"" She then paused and spoke again ""Get into contact with laterno, and beg with them to assist us and allow Rhode island to take refuge in Latern city. Latern city is out best bet at having the main base remain undamaged in the fighting to come.""



""The Sankta? Are you sure, madam?""



""It's our best chance.""



""Will you go with us if they allow us to set camp in their lands?""



She then paused and carefully spoke, ""No. I'll stay behind and be the spark, but they're the wax. Laterno city remains still the most defended, prosperous and strongest city in Terra, worst case scenario it shall be Rhode island and humanity's main bastion against the seaborn threat.""

  


The Operator/ assistant nodded and made their way out of the room, right now her head felt dizzy all she could ask is why



Her one reliable source of information, and one of Rhode islands most brilliant strategists, the doctor, had quietly disappeared when Aegir fell. Why did the Terra not take Aegir's warning of the seabron seriously? Why Aegir's have to fall so fast? Why are the seaborn doing this?

  
**Recorded meeting log....**

**Time and Date:** 0139 EST; 08/30/1097

**Preamble:** Following Ishimura's awakening within Skadi's conscious and initial seaborn invasion, Defacto leader of Rhodes Island Kal'tsit hosts a meeting and makes an ultimatum, speaking before a Council of representatives from all over Terra as well as several key operators who attended as spectators. In tandem, the speech was broadcasted to the world with countermeasure systems in place by Rhodes island incase of the rare chance of the seaborn hacking the broadcast.



*Council chambers in uproar, representatives from different nations and organizations shouting at each other*

  
**Kal'tsit:** Good evening, friends.



*The chamber slowly quiets down.*



**Kal'tsit:** I understand we all have a busy night, so allow me to—



*Kal'tsit falters. The chamber falls silent.*



**Kal'tsit:** Allow me to begin this gathering. I uh—I understand our hardships. I understand you are all afraid, and you have all fought valiantly.



*Pauses, clutching at her sheet of paper behind the lectern. Hecklers from the audience begin calling out.*



**Kal'tsit:** War is a battle we must fight together, and without your support, we cannot-



**Mino's representative:** This is fruitless, Kal'tsit. The outcome will not change. If you believe—



**Reunion Representative/Leader:** Stop it. Let her speak.



**Iberian Speaker:** Let her speak? The world is on fucking fire, Talulah—



**Victorian Representative:** Watch yourself gentlewomen.

  
**Iberian Speaker:** —and we're here dilly-dallying like nothing happened! Our capital is under siege; Kazdel had its entire army wiped out in a day and is dust; and if we look to the empire of Sargon—God, have you seen the coastline of Sargon? Of course you haven't, because it didn't have one but now you'll see a fucking wave of ocean and hundreds of thousands of dead bodies. Rhine labs and their tech? Don't make me laugh it isn't going to do anything. Any contingences we've made is not going to save us—

  
**Columbian Speaker:** And you believe your frustrations will help us?



**Iberian Speaker:** Who the hell do you think you are?



**Columbian Speaker:** An arbiter, apparently, since your incompetent mind can't fathom a civil conversation even at the end of the world. I don't appreciate people who waste the time of those who are trying to help.

  


**Iberian speaker:** I beg your pardon? Are you any better? Have your promises of medicinal airdrops for the people of my country been honored at all?! YOU LET THEM MELT!



**Columbian Speaker:** And did you follow through on your promise of protecting Rhine labs equipment, our military and medical equipment being shipped to you? I know because I have *fifteen* heavy transport vessels shot down by *the seaborn* amalgamations you promised you would prevent from reaching the supply drop point—

  
**Kal'tsit :** Gentlemen, ladies—



**Laterno Representative:** This is pointless.



**Ursus Representative:** Order!



**Reunion Representative/Leader:** I lean to concur with the Ursus representative despite his empires disgusting attitude towards the infected and rotteness in general.



*The Talulah yelled her last word. The Ursus Representative stands up immediately.*



**Ursus Representative:** I will not have my empire be insulted before a terrorist and infected organization. You Reunion pushers are here because you—as a half-assed organization—are of no use. You are helpless and useless, the only good asset you have is the Patriot outside of him your nothing.



*Talulah stands up*

  
**Reunion Representative/leader:** Would you like me to demonstrate what I can do that you cannot? The Seaborn may have killed all of your experiential operatives and 25% of your military so far, but I can make doubly sure the rest of you and your rotten empire burn.

  
**Yan represenative:** Contain yourselves please!



**Ursus Representative:** Try it. I dare you infected whore.



**Kal'tsit :** Silence, everyone!



*The Victorian Ambassador scoffs.*



**Victorian ambassador:** You all lack restraint.



**Lapland:** This meeting seems soon to move onto a first-name basis! I personally find this entertaining. How about you, Texas?



**Texas:** Do not speak to me.



**Bolivar Ambassador:** Perhaps we should reconvene at a later time.



*Lapland smirks and chuckles, crossing her legs over Texas table, who stands up in annoyance and swats her off.*

  
**Reunion Representative/Leader:** This is a waste of time. So much for that plan you promised me, Kal'stit, but I should've figured all they'd all just be headless chickens running around—



*Kal'tsit pulls out her sidearm and fires a round in the air. The chamber falls silent, some Council members ducking for cover. Numerous alarmed Rhode islands operators and security personnel dart through the entrances, weapons readied. Kal'tsit holsters her weapon, looks at her sheaf of paper, then tears it apart.*

  
**Kal'tsit:** Members of Terra, our existence hangs on a thread slowly tearing apart. What holds us back is not the seaborn but ourselves.



*Some council members scoff.*



**Kal'tsit:** We have lost far too much in a matter of seconds to succumb to our own foolishness.



*She gently taps a watch on her right wrist. After a brief moment, a projector from near the balconies projected a white text against the black backdrop above and behind her. It read, ""92,124,000,"" gradually increasing in increments of a thousand, intermittently spiking in growth. Hushed voices begin to speak amongst one another.*



**Kal'tsit :** Confirmed deaths, mind you. Many of the rest are ones we cannot find or, unbeknownst to us, have turned into… something.



*She points at the projection.*



**Kal'tsit :** The longer we wait, the faster you'll join them in the sea of rising bodies.

  
*The chamber begins to die down and Kal'tsit lets out a sigh of relief*

  
**Kal'tsit:** No, I do not understand the battle; I haven't sunk into the mud for a long time. No, I do not understand your struggles, your hopes, and your prides; I have only ignorantly sought out a non-existent peace of mind. No, I do not understand your dreams; mine has been clouded with the fear of Rhode islands collapse, taking me down with it, and by the time I finally opened my eyes, I was already drowning. And to this point, I no longer remember my dream. I don't know what I wanted when this began and what I want now. I know only sacrifice.



*Pauses and continues*   


**Kal'tsit:** I do not ask for any apologies, these are trying times and such outbursts by us our expectedly: I have failed, Rhode island has failed, We have all failed. We've fallen deaf from our own pointless banters and struggles. It has always been pointless wars and struggles between the nations of Terra and also Rhode island. Infected vs no infected, the rich vs the poor, ideological battles. Funnily enough, the only people we've been yelling at are each other, and we've done it so much that when Aegirs warned us we were to busy with our own hatred of each other to pay attention. We were so busy thinking about imaginary threats that we never saw the real one until it was to late. And so, when the Seaborns tendrils suddenly pointed outwards, towards the shorelines, I was ill-prepared—we were ill-prepared, completely oblivious until that number counted over a million. And in their wake, in our delusions where we spilled blood on each other instead of the real enemy, when the invasion came, we woke up to a rising sun showering light on a sea of corpses. And not even half of those bodies made up the true death count.



*Kal'tsit looks on at the silent members of the council, her mind already clouded and foggy with exhaustion.*



**Kal'tsit:** Are we still drowning, just closer to death?



**Kal'tsit:** Should we, the leaders and representatives of Terra, accept the responsibility of being Terra's last hope—standing before us and the world—is it worth it to finally give up?



**Kal'tsit:** Do those sacrifices mean nothing of all our soldiers, operators, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, and countless more among the rising pile of corpses mean nothing in the end?



*She pauses.*



**Kal'tsit:** Yes, maybe delaying death is pointless.



*She raises her fist in the air.*

  
**Kal'tsit:** But I refuse to lie down and die without a fight. Rhode island refuses to lie down without a fight! Should you all follow in suit. Yes. Do not care if there's no rationale for it; We are the leaders of Terra, it is our duty to refuse to turn our heels and kneel, if Terra is to fall it will be by our hands, not the hands of some abominations from the sea. And if a bullet, shell, arrow, or sword strikes me down in this coming fight, I will die with my Operators on the battlefield *as one.* And you all should to with your respective countrymen

**Kal'tsit:** For the first time in my life, an overwhelming sense of unity has compelled me, as if every person on Terra banded together for the very first time and possible for the last time. So how can the representatives—the leaders of Terra not follow suit? Tell me, do you and your families wish to lay in the front yard and wait? And to those who have already lost everything, do you want another to share the same pain you now hold? Can you really handle the tremble plaguing your hands, feet, and heart? I know you feel it, and to me, that kind of death is far worse than anything else. Because if it were up to me, I wouldn't wish that even on my worst enemy. Will you and I grab onto this rope connecting us to the rest of the world, or will you cut it loose?

  
*She slams her first down hard on the podium cracking it* 

  
**D.C. al Fine:** Because I'm sick of it! We are the Leaders of Terra, their protectors, the ones that guide its people forward, whether they like it or not. If it were up to me, I'd hold on for dear fucking life and scream my lungs out. I'll make damn sure the dead above sees a flourishing garden below as! I would hold onto that rope until my hands are nothing by blistered and bloodied messes! Above all I and you all should hold onto that rope because we have no other choice, this is a threat that we have to face together.



*She raises her fist once more.*



**Kal'tsit:** And the only way we can make sure Terra survives this threat or at least falls together is **As One!**

  


**Debrief:** All Rhodes island prerequisites (barring one) were quickly accomplished following Kal'tsit speech, and Rhode island spearhead multiple defensive contingency plans against the Seaborn in conjunction with other major organizations and nations on Terra.



**Reminder:** All Rhodes Island personnel and operatives report to your supervisor or nearby facility advisor for immediate reassignment.

  
**Teaser for part 2**

  
**Accessing classified audio recording.....**



**Recording loaded.....**



Oh—oh my God. It works!



If your reading me, It's me, Kal'tsit, the Doctor. I think my watch has been sounding off for quite some time now. Fuck, my voice is killing me, what the hell did I do?



Everything was a fuzz before I realized my watch, like some revelation came over me. Something's really wrong with me. How the fuck did I not notice my watch?



I'm not compromised. Just… give me a second.



\[Sigh.\]



Code Triton-Oscar-Spirit, ID 90213921/Z01. My watch is intact and I need immediate assistance. I've activated my beacon for egress, and… I-I don't remember what position I held. Well, not in Rhode island, I mean for… Well, obviously, for fuck sakes. It's all… slush. Why can't I remember?



I'm currently in a small room, the door to my left leading out to… wherever I am, and a door labeled....something...I can't read it.....ugh, its to my right. It's too hot outside right now, gonna wait 'till it dies down.



\[Pause.\]



Triton-Oscar-Spirit, 9021—ah, fuck, maybe I am becoming one of them, I just don't know it.



Run these recordings through the data bank if your getting this Kal'tsit, tell Amiya I'm alive, and whatever you need to do to stop this madness. Maybe I am burnt, but I can't say for certain. I'll perform a self-evaluation and then investigate what's going on.

  CLAIRE  
  
  Claire Danvers was in a rare bad mood, and nearly getting arrested didn't improve it.  
  
  First, her university classes hadn't gone well at all, and then she'd had a humiliating argument with her ""adviser"" (she usually thought of him that way, in quotes, because he didn't ""advise"" her to do anything but take boring core subjects and not chal enge herself), and then she'd gotten a completely unfair B on a physics paper she knew had been letter perfect. She would have grudgingly accepted a B on something unimportant, like history, but no, it had to be in her major. And of course Professor Carlyle wasn't in his office to talk about it.  
  
  So she wasn't fully paying attention when she stepped off the curb. Traffic in Morganville, Texas, wasn't exactly fast and furious, and here by Texas Prairie University, people were fully used to stopping for oblivious students.  
  
  Stil , the screech of brakes surprised her and sent her stumbling back to the safety of the sidewalk, and it was only after a couple of fast breaths that she realized she'd nearly been run over by a police cruiser.  
  
  And a policeman was getting out of the car, looking grim.  
  
  As he stalked over to her she realized he was probably a vampire-he was too pale to be a human, and he had on sunglasses even here in the shade of the building. Glancing at the cruiser to confirm, she saw the extreme tinting job on the windows. Definitely vampire police. The official slogan of the police was to protect and serve, but her boyfriend cal ed the vampire patrol the to protect and serve up for dinner patrol.  
  
  It was unusual to see one so close to the university, though. Normally, vampire cops worked at night, and closer to the center of town, where Founder's Square was located, along with the central vamp population. Only the regular residents would see them there, and not the transient- though pretty oblivious-students.  
  
  ""I'm sorry,"" she said, and swal owed a rusty taste in her mouth that seemed composed of shock and entirely useless anger. ""I wasn't looking where I was going. ""  
  
  ""Obviously,"" he said. Like most vamps, he had an accent, but she'd long ago given up trying to identify it; if they lived long enough, vampires tended to pick up dozens of accents, and many of them were antique anyway. His facial features seemed. . . maybe Chinese? ""Identification. ""  
  
  ""For walking?""  
  
  ""Identification. ""  
  
  Claire swal owed her protest and reached in her backpack for her wal et. She pulled out her student ID card and Texas driver's license and handed them over. He glanced at them and shoved the cards back.  
  
  ""Not those,"" he said. ""Your town identification. ""  
  
  ""My. . . what?""  
  
  ""You should have received it in the mail. ""  
  
  ""Wel , I haven't!""  
  
  He took off his sunglasses. Behind them, his eyes were very dark, but there were hints of red. He stared at her for a moment, then nodded.  
  
  ""Al right. When you get your card, carry it at alltimes. And next time, watch your step. You get yourself hit by a car, I'll consider you roadkil . ""  
  
  With that, he put the sunglasses back on, turned, and got back in his car. Before Claire could think about any way to respond, he'd put the cruiser in gear and whipped around the corner.  
  
  It did not improve her mood.  
  
  Before she could even think about going home, Claire had a mandatory stop to make, at her part-time job. She dreaded it today, because she knew she was in no shape to deal with the incredibly inconsistent moods of Myrnin, her vampire mad-scientist boss. He might be laser focused and super-rational; he might be talking to crockery and quoting Alice in Wonderland (that had been the scene during her last visit). But whatever he was doing, he'd have work for her, and probably too much of it.  
  
  But at least he was never, ever boring.  
  
  She'd made the walk so often that she did it on autopilot, hardly even noticing the streets and houses and the alley down which she had to pass; she checked her phone and read texts as she jogged down the long marble steps that led into the darkness of his lab, or lair, whichever mood he was in today. The lights were on, which was nice. As she put her phone away, she saw that Myrnin was bent over a microscope-an ancient thing that she'd tried to put away a dozen times in favor of a newer electronic model, but he kept unearthing the thing. He stepped away from the eyepiece to scribble numbers frantically on a chalkboard. The board was covered in numbers, and to Claire's eyes they looked completely random -not just in terms of their numerical values, but in the way they'd been written, at allangles and in allareas of the available space. Some were even upside down. It wasn't a formula or an analysis. It was complete gibberish.  
  
  So. It was going to be one of those days. Lovely.  
  
  ""Hey,"" Claire said with fatalistic resignation as she dumped her backpack on the floor and opened up a drawer to retrieve her lab coat. It was a good thing she looked first; Myrnin had dumped an assortment of scalpels in on top of the fabric. Any one of them could have sliced her to the bone. ""What are you doing?""  
  
  ""Did you know that certain types of coral qualify as immortal? The definition of scientific immortality is that if the mortality rate of a species doesn't increase after it reaches maturity, there is no such thing as aging. . . black coral, for instance. Or the Great Basin bristlecone pine. I'm trying to determine if there is any resemblance between the development of those cel ular colonies with the replacement of human cel s that takes place in a conversion to vampirism. . . . "" He was talking a mile a minute, with a fever pitch that Claire always dreaded. It meant he was in need of medication, which he wouldn't take; she'd need to be stealthy about adding it to his blood supply, again, to bring him down a little into the rational zone. ""Did you bring me a hamburger?""  
  
  ""Did I- No, Myrnin, I didn't bring you a hamburger. "" Bizarre. He'd never asked for that before.  
  
  ""Coffee?""  
  
  ""It's late. ""  
  
  ""Doughnuts?""  
  
  ""No. ""  
  
  ""What good are you, then?"" He finally looked up from the microscope, made another note or two on the board, and stepped back to consider the chaos of chalk marks. ""Oh dear. That's not very-is this where I started? Claire?"" He pointed at a number somewhere near the top right corner.  
  
  ""I wasn't here,"" Claire said, and buttoned up her lab coat. ""Do you want me to keep working on the machine?""  
  
  ""The what? Oh, yes, that thing. Do, please. "" He crossed his arms and stared at the board, frowning now. It was not a personal-grooming highlight day for him, either. His long, dark hair was in tangles and needed a wash; she was sure the oversized somewhat-white shirt he was wearing had been used as a rag to wipe up chemical spil s at sometime in its long life. He'd had the presence of mind to put on some kind of pants, though she wasn't sure the baggy walking shorts were what she'd have chosen. At least the flip-flops kind of matched. ""How was school?""  
  
  ""Bad,"" she said.  
  
  ""Good,"" he said absently, ""very good. . . Ah, I think this is where I started. . . . Fibonacci sequence-I see what I did. . . . "" He began drawing a spiral through the numbers, starting somewhere at the center. Of course, he'd be noting down results in a spiral. Why not?  
  
  Claire felt a headache coming on. The place was dirty again, grit on the floor that was a combination of sand blown in from the desert winds, and whatever Myrnin had been working with that he'd spil ed liberally allover the place. She only hoped it wasn't too toxic. She'd have to schedule a day to get him out of here so she could get reorganized, sweep up the debris, stack the books back in some kind of order, shelve the lab equipment. . . . No, that wouldn't be a day. More like a week.  
  
  She gave up thinking about it, then went to the lab table on the right side of the room, which was covered by a dusty sheet. She pulled the cover off, coughed at the bil ows of grit that flew up, and looked at the machine she was building. It was definitely her own creation, this thing: it lacked most of the eccentric design elements that Myrnin would have put into it, though he'd sneaked in a few flywheels and glowing liquids along the way.  
  
  I  
t was oblong, practical, bel -shaped, and had oscil ation controls along the sides. She thought it looked a bit like an old-fashioned science fiction ray gun, but it had a very different use. . . if it had ever worked.  
  
  Claire hooked up the device to the plug-in analyzing programs, and began to run simulations. It was a project Myrnin had proposed months ago, and it had taken her this long to get even close to a solution. . . . The vampires had an ability, so far mysterious and decidedly unscientific, to influence the minds and emotions of others-humans, mostly, but sometimes other vampires. Every vampire had a different set of strengths and weaknesses, but most shared some kind of emotional-control mechanism; it helped them calm their prey, or convince them to surrender their blood voluntarily.  
  
  What she was working on was a way to cancel that ability. To give humans-and even other vampires-a way to defend themselves against the manipulation.  
  
  Claire had gone from building a machine that could pinpoint and map emotions to one that could build feedback loops, heightening what was already there. It was a necessary step to get to the control stage-you had to be able to replicate the ability to negate it. If you thought of emotion as a wavelength, you could either amplify or cancel it with the flick of a switch.  
  
  ""Myrnin?"" She didn't look up from the analysis running on the laptop computer screen. ""Did you mess with my project?""  
  
  ""A little,"" he said. ""Isn't it better?""  
  
  It was. She had no idea what he'd done to it, but adjusting the controls showed precise calibrations that she couldn't have done herself. ""Did you maybe write down how you did it?""  
  
  ""Probably,"" Myrnin said cheerfully. ""But I don't think it wil help. It's just hearing the cycles and tuning to them. I don't think you're capable, with your limited human senses. If you'd become a vampire, you'd have so much more potential, you know. ""  
  
  She didn't answer that. She'd found it was really best not to engage in that particular debate with him, and besides, in the next second he'd forgotten allabout it, focused on his enthusiasm for black coral.  
  
  On paper, the device they'd developed-wel , she'd developed, and Myrnin had tweaked-seemed to work. Now she'd have to figure out how to test it, make sure it exactly replicated the way the vampire ability worked. . . and then make sure she could cancel that ability, reliably. It might even have other applications. If you could make an attacking vampire afraid, make him back off, you could end a fight without violence.  
  
  That alone made the work worthwhile.  
  
  And what happens when someone uses it the other way? she wondered. What happens if an attacker gets hold of it, then uses it to make you more afraid, as a victim? She didn't have an answer for that. It was one of the things that made her feel, sometimes, that this was a bad idea-and that she ought to simply destroy the thing before it caused more trouble.  
  
  But maybe not quite yet.  
  
  Claire unhooked the machine-she didn't have any kind of cool name for it yet, or even a project designation-and tested the weight of it. Heavy. She'd built it from solid components, and it generated considerable waste heat, but it was a prototype; it'd improve, if it was worthwhile. She tried aiming it at the wal . It was a little awkward, but if she added a grip up front, that would help stabilize it-  
  
  ""Claire?""  
  
  Myrnin's voice came from right behind her, way too close. She whirled, and her finger accidentally hit the switch on top as she fumbled her hold on the machine, and suddenly there was a live trial in action. . . on him.  
  
  She saw it work.  
  
  Myrnin's eyes widened, turned very dark, and then began to shimmer with liquid hints of red. He took a step back from her. A large one. ""Oh,"" he said. ""Don't do that. Please don't do that. ""  
  
  She shut it off, fast, because she wasn't sure what exactly had just happened. Something, for sure, but as live trials went, it was. . . inconclusive. ""Sorry, sorry,"" she said, and put the device down with a clunk on the marble top of the lab table. ""I didn't mean to do that. Um. . . what did you feel?""  
  
  ""More of what I already felt,"" he said, which was uninformative. He took another step backward, and the red didn't seem to be fading from his eyes. ""I was going to ask you if you'd send over some type AB from the blood bank; I seem to be running low. And also, I wanted to ask if you'd seen my bag of gummi worms. ""  
  
  ""You're hungry,"" Claire guessed. He nodded cautiously. ""And it. . . made it stronger?""  
  
  ""In a way,"" he said. Not helpful. ""Never mind the delivery from the blood bank. I believe I shal . . . take a walk. Good night, Claire. ""  
  
  He was being awfully polite, she thought; with him, that was usually a cover for severe internal issues. Before she could try to figure out exactly what was going on in his head, though, he'd headed at vampire-speed for the stairs and was gone.  
  
  She shook her head and looked at the switched-off device in irritation. ""Wel , that was helpful,"" she told it, and then rolled her eyes. ""And now I'm talking to equipment, like him. Great. ""  
  
  Claire threw a sheet over the machine, made notes in the logbook, turned off the lab's lights, and headed home.  
  
  Arriving home-on Lot Street-didn't do much for her mood, either, because as she stomped past the rusty, leaning mailbox on the outside of the picket fence, she saw that the door was open and mail was sticking out. It threatened to blow away in the ever-present desert wind. Perfect. She had three housemates, and allof them had somehow failed to pick up the mail. And that was not her job. At least today.  
  
  She glared up at the big, faded Victorian house, and wondered when Shane was going to get around to painting it as he'd promised he would. Never, most likely. Just like the mail.  
  
  Claire readjusted her heavy backpack on one shoulder, an automatic, thoughtless shift of weight, snatched the wadded-up paper out of the box, and flipped through the thick handfuls. Water bil (apparently, saving the town from water-dwel ing draug monsters hadn't given them any utility credits), electric bil (high, again), flyers from the new pizza delivery place (whose pizza tasted like dog food on tomato sauce), and. . . four envelopes, embossed with the Founder's official seal.  
  
  She headed for the house. And then the day took one step further to the dark side, because pinned to the front door with a cheap pot-metal dagger was a hand-drawn note with four tombstones on it. Each headstone had one of their names. And below, it said, Vampire lovers get what they deserve.  
  
  Charming. It would have scared her except that it wasn't the first she'd seen over the past few weeks; there had been four other notes, one slipped under the door, two pinned on it (like this one), and one slipped into the mailbox. That, and a steady and growing number of rude storekeepers, deliberate insults from people on the street, and doors slammed in her face.  
  
  It was no longer popular being the friend of the only mixed-marriage vampire/human couple in Morganville.  
  
  Claire ripped the note off, shook her head over the cheap dagger, which would snap in a fight, and unlocked the front door. She hip-bumped it open, closed it, and locked it again-automatic caution, in Morganville. ""Hey!"" she yel ed without looking up. ""Who was supposed to get the mail?""  
  
  ""Eve!"" Shane yel ed from down the hal , in the direction of the living room, at the same time that Eve shouted, ""Michael!"" from upstairs. Michael said nothing, probably because he wasn't home yet.  
  
  ""We really need to talk about schedules! Again!"" Claire cal ed back. She briefly considered showing them the flyer, but then she bal ed it up and threw it, and the dagger, in the trash, along with the assorted junk mail offering discount crap and high-interest credit cards.  
  
  It's just talk, she told herself. It wasn't, but she thought that eventually, everyone-human and vampire-would just get their col ective panties unbunched about Michael and Eve's getting married. It was nobody's business but their own, after all.  
  
  She focused instead on the four identical envelopes.  
  
  They were made of fancy, heavy paper that smel ed musty and old, as if it had been stored somewhere for a hundred years and someone was just getting ar  
ound to opening the box. The seal on the back of each was wax, deep crimson, and embossed with the Founder's symbol. Each of their names was written on the outside in flowing, elegant script, so even and perfect, it looked like computer printing until she looked closely and found the human imperfections.  
  
  Her instincts were tingling danger, but she tried to think positively. C'mon, this could be a good thing, she told herself. Maybe it's just a thank- you card from Amelie for saving Morganville. Again. We deserve that.  
  
  Sounded good, but Amelie, the Founder of Morganville, was a very old vampire, and vamps weren't in the business of thanking people. Amelie had grown up royalty, and having people do crazy, dangerous (and possibly fatal) things on her slightest whim was just. . . normal. It probably didn't even cal for a smile, much less a note of gratitude. And, to be honest, Claire's once almost-friendly status with the Founder had gotten a bit. . . strained.  
  
  Morganville, Texas, was just about the last gathering place for vampires in the world; it was the spot that they'd chosen to make their last stand, to forget their old grudges, to band tightly together against common threats and enemies. When Claire had first arrived, the vampires had been battling il ness; then they'd been after one another. And four months ago, they'd been fighting the draug, water creatures that preyed on vampires like delicious, tasty snacks. . . and the vampires had finally won.  
  
  That left them the undisputed champions of the world's food chain. In saving Morganville, Claire hadn't really stopped to consider what might happen when the vamps no longer had something to fear. Now she knew.  
  
  They didn't exactly feel grateful.  
  
  Oh, on the surface, Morganville was allgood, or at least getting better. . . . The vamps had been fast on the trigger to start repairing the town, cleaning up after the demise of the draug, and getting allof their human population settled again in their homes, businesses, and schools. The official PR line had been that a dangerous chemical spil had forced evacuations, and that seemed to have satisfied everybody (along with generous cash payments, and automatic good grades to allof the students at Texas Prairie University who'd had their semesters cut short). Claire also suspected that the vampires had applied some psychic persuasion, where necessary-there were a few of them capable of doing that. On the surface, it looked like Morganville was not only recovering, but thriving.  
  
  But it didn't feel right. On the few occasions that she'd seen Amelie, the Founder hadn't seemed right, either. Her body language, her smile, the way she looked at people. . . al were different. And darker.  
  
  ""Hey,"" her housemate Eve Rosser-no, it was Eve Glass now, after the wedding-said. ""You going to open those or what?"" She walked up beside Claire, set a glass down on the kitchen counter, and poured herself a tal glass of milk. Her ruby wedding ring winked at Claire as if inviting her to share a secret joke. ""Because the last time I saw something looking that official, it was inviting me to a party. And you know how much I love those. ""  
  
  ""You almost got kil ed at that party,"" Claire said absently. She passed over Eve's envelope and picked up her own.  
  
  ""I almost get kil ed at most parties. Hence, you can tel that's how much I love them,"" Eve said, and ripped open the paper in a wide, tearing swath. Claire-who was by nature more of a neat gently-slice-the-thing-open kind of person-winced. ""Huh. Another envelope inside the envelope. They do love to waste paper. Haven't they ever heard of tree-hugging?""  
  
  As Eve extracted the second layer, Claire had a chance to do the usual wardrobe scan of her best friend. . . and wasn't disappointed. Eve had suddenly taken a liking to aqua blue, and she'd added streaks of it in her black hair, which was worn today in cute, shiny ponytails on the sides of her head. Her Goth white face was brightened by aqua eye shadow and-where did she find this stuff?-matching lipstick, and she had on a tight black shirt with embossed crosses. The short, poufy skirt continued the blue theme. Then black tights with blue hearts. Then, combat boots.  
  
  So, a typical Wednesday, really.  
  
  Eve pulled the inner envelope free, opened the flap, and extracted a folded sheet of thick paper. Something fel out to bounce on the counter, and Claire caught it.  
  
  It was a card. A plastic card, like a credit card, but this one had the Founder's symbol screened on the back, and it had Eve's picture in the upper right corner-taken when she'd been without the ful Goth war paint, which Eve would despise. It had Eve's name, address, phone number. . . and a box at the bottom that read Blood Type: O Neg. Across from it was a box saying Protector: Glass, Michael.  
  
  ""What the. . . ?"" Oh, Claire thought, even before she'd finished the question. This must have been what the vampire cop was asking her for. The identification card.  
  
  Eve plucked the card from her fingers, stared at it with a completely blank expression, and then turned her attention to the letter that had come with it. ""'Dear Mrs. Michael Glass,'"" she read. ""Seriously? Mrs. Michael? Like I don't even have a name of my own? And what the hel is this about his being my Protector? I never agreed to that!""  
  
  ""And?"" Claire reached for the letter, but Eve hip-checked her and continued reading.  
  
  ""'I have enclosed your new Morganville Resident Identification Card, which allhuman residents are now required to carry at alltimes so that, in the unlikely case of any emergency, we may quickly contact your loved ones and Protector, and provide necessary medical information. '"" Eve looked up and met Claire's eyes squarely. ""I cal bul shit. Human residents. With blood type listed? It's like a shopping list for vamps. ""  
  
  Claire nodded. ""What else?""  
  
  Eve turned her attention back to the paper. ""'Failure to carry and provide this card upon request wil result in fines of-' Oh, screw this!"" Eve wadded up the paper, dropped it on the floor, and stomped on it with her boots, which were certainly made for stomping. ""I am not carrying around a Drink Me card, and they can't ask for my papers. What is this, Naziland?"" She picked up the card and tried to bend it in half, but it was too flexible.  
  
  ""Where did you put the scissors. . . ?""  
  
  Claire rescued the card and looked at it again. She turned it over, held it under the strongest light available-the window-and frowned. ""Better not,"" she said. ""I think this is chipped. ""  
  
  ""Chipped? Can I eat it?""  
  
  ""Microchipped. It's got some kind of tech in it, anyway. I'd have to take a look to see what kind, but it's pretty safe to say they'd know if you went allpaper dol s with it. ""  
  
  ""Oh great, so it's not just a Drink Me card; it's a tracking device, like those ear things they put on lions on Animal Planet? Yeah, there's no way that can go wrong-like, say, vampires being issued receivers so they can just shop online for who they want to target tonight. ""  
  
  Eve was right about that, Claire thought. She really didn't feel good about this. On the surface, it was just an ID card, perfectly normal-she already carried a student ID and a driver's license-but it felt like something else. Something more sinister.  
  
  Eve stopped rummaging in drawers and just stared at her. ""Hey. We each got one. Four envelopes. ""  
  
  ""I thought they were only for human residents,"" Claire said. ""So what's in Michael's?"" Because Michael Glass was definitely not human these days. He'd been bitten well before Claire had met him, but the ful -on vampire thing had been slow-building; she saw it more and more now, but deep down she thought he was still the same strong, sweet, no-nonsense guy she'd met when she'd first arrived on the Glass House doorstep. He was definitely still strong. It was the sweetness that was in some danger of fading away, over time.  
  
  Before Claire could warn Eve that maybe it wasn't the greatest idea, Eve shredded open Michael's envelope, too, yanked out the inner one, and pul ed out his letter. Another card fel out. This one was gold. Shiny, shiny gold. It didn't have any info on it at all. Just a gold card, with the Founder's symbol embossed on it.  
  
  Eve went for the letter. ""'Dear Michael,'"" she said. ""Oh, sure, he gets Michael, not Mr. Glass. . . . 'Dear Michael, I have enclosed your card of privilege, as has been discussed in our commu  
nity meetings. '"" She stopped again, reread that silently, and looked down at the card she was holding in her fingers. ""Card of privilege? He doesn't get the same treatment we do. ""  
  
  ""Community meetings,"" Claire said. ""Which we weren't invited to, right? And what kind of privileges, exactly?""  
  
  ""You'd better believe it's a whole lot better than a free mocha at Common Grounds,"" Eve said grimly. She kept reading, silently, then handed the paper stiff-armed to Claire, not saying another word.  
  
  Claire took it, feeling a bit il now. It read:  
  
  Dear Michael,  
  
  I have enclosed your card of privilege, as has been discussed in our community meetings. Please keep this card close, and you are welcome to use it at any time at the blood bank, Bloodmobile, or Common Grounds for up to ten pints monthly.  
  
  Wow, it really was good for free drinks. But that wasn't all.  
  
  This card also entitles you to one legal hunt per year without advance declaration of intent. Additional hunts must be preapproved through the Elders' Council. Failure to seek preapproval will result in fines of up to five thousand dollars per occurrence, payable to the family's Protector, if applicable, or to the City of Morganville, if there is no Protector on file.  
  
  Best wishes from the Founder,  
  
  Amelie  
  
  For a moment, Claire couldn't quite understand what she was reading. Her eyes kept going over it, and over it, and finally it allsnapped into clear, razor-sharp focus, and she pulled in a deep, shaking breath. The paper creased as her grip tensed up.  
  
  ""Yeah,"" Eve said. Claire met her gaze wordlessly. ""It's tel ing him he gets a free pass to kil one person a year, just on a whim. Or more if he plans it out. You know, like a special treat. Privilege. "" There was nothing in her tone, or her face, or her eyes. Just. . . blank. Locked down.  
  
  Eve took the paper from Claire's unresisting hand, folded it, and put it back in the envelope with the gold card.  
  
  ""What-what are you going to say to him?"" Claire couldn't quite get her head adjusted. This was wrong, just. . . wrong.  
  
  ""Nothing good,"" Eve said.  
  
  And that was the precise moment when the kitchen door opened, and Michael stepped inside. He was wearing a thick black canvas cowboy-style duster coat, broad-brimmed hat, and black gloves. Eve had teased him earlier that he looked like an anime superhero, but it was allpractical vampire sun-resistant gear. Michael was relatively still newborn as a vampire, which meant he was especially vulnerable to the sun, and to burning up.  
  
  Now, he whipped off his hat and gave the two of them an elaborate bow he'd probably copied from a movie (or, Claire thought, learned from one of the older vamps), and rose from that with a broad, sweet smile. ""Hey, Claire. And hello, Mrs. Glass. "" There was a special gentleness when he said Mrs. Glass-a private kind of thing, and it was both breathtaking and heartbreaking.  
  
  Heartbreaking, because in the next second, he knew something was wrong. The smile faltered, and Michael glanced from Eve to Claire, then back to Eve. ""What?"" He dumped the hat and his gloves on the table, and shed the coat without looking away from Eve's face. ""Baby? What's wrong?"" He walked to her and put his hands on her shoulders. His wedding ring matched hers, even down to the ruby inset, and it caught the light the way Eve's had earlier.  
  
  Bloodred.  
  
  It was terrible, Claire thought, that he was still so much Michael-stil exactly as he'd been when she first met him-eighteen, though they were al catching up to him now in age. It wasn't fair to cal him pretty, but he was gorgeous-tumbles of blond curls that somehow always looked perfect; clear, direct blue eyes the color of a morning sky. His pal or gave him the perfect look of ivory, and when he stood still , as he was now, he looked like some fabulous lost statue direct from Greece or Rome.  
  
  It wasn't fair.  
  
  Eve held the gaze between herself and her husband, and said, ""This is for you. "" She held up the inner envelope with his name written on it in flowing script.  
  
  For a second, Michael clearly didn't know what it was. . . and then Claire saw him realize. His eyes widened, and something like horror passed over his expression and was quickly hidden underneath a blank, carefully composed mask. He didn't say anything, but just took his hands from her shoulders and accepted the envelope. He stuck it in his pocket.  
  
  ""You're not even pretending to be curious?"" Eve said. Her voice had gone deep in her throat and had taken on a dangerous edge. ""Great. ""  
  
  ""You read it?"" he asked, and took it out again to open it up. The card fel out, again, but he deftly snatched it out of the air without any effort. ""Huh. It's shinier than I thought it'd be. ""  
  
  ""That's allyou have to say?""  
  
  He unfolded the letter. Claire was no good at reading those micro-expressions people on TV were always talking about on crime shows, but she thought he looked guilty as he read it. Guilty as hel .  
  
  ""It's not what you think,"" he said, which was exactly the wrong thing to say, because it made Claire (and almost certainly Eve) think about every guy ever caught cheating. Luckily, he didn't stop there. ""Eve, allvampires get the hunting privilege; it's just part of living in Morganville-it's always been the rule, even when nobody in the human community knew. Look, I don't want it. I opposed the whole idea at the meetings-""  
  
  ""Which you didn't tel us about at all, jerk,"" Eve broke in. ""We're community!""  
  
  Michael took a deep breath and continued. ""I told Amelie and Oliver I wouldn't ever use it, but they didn't care. ""  
  
  ""Doesn't matter. You have a free pass for murder. ""  
  
  ""No,"" he said, and took her hands in his, a gesture so quick she couldn't avoid it, but gentle enough that she could have pulled away if she'd wanted. ""No, Eve. You know me better than that. I'm trying to change it. ""  
  
  Her eyes filled with tears, suddenly, and she col apsed against his chest. Michael put his arms around her and held her tightly, his head resting against hers. He was whispering. Claire couldn't hear what he was saying, but it really wasn't any of her business.  
  
  She took the glass of milk Eve had poured for herself, seeing as how it was sitting there unwanted, and drank it. He still should have told us, she thought, and slit her envelope open with a steak knife to take out her own letter and ID card. It felt weird, seeing her information on there. Even though the vampires had always known what her blood type was, where she lived. . . it felt different, somehow.  
  
  Official.  
  
  As if she were some kind of commodity. Worse: with the chip in it, it meant she couldn't hide, couldn't run. She now, as Eve had said, had papers, just as they demanded in those old black-and-white war movies; she had to carry the card or get arrested (today's encounter had proven that), and it meant that they could round her up whenever they wanted. . . for questioning. Or for sticking her in some kind of prison camp.  
  
  Or worse.  
  
  One thing was certain: Shane Col ins was not going to like this at all. . . and just as she thought about that, Shane banged in the swinging door of the kitchen, headed straight for the refrigerator, and snagged himself a cold soft drink, which he popped open and chugged three swal ows of before he stopped, looked at Eve and Michael, and said, ""Oh, come on. Don't tel me you guys are fighting again. Seriously, isn't there supposed to be a honeymoon period or something?""  
  
  ""We're not fighting,"" Michael said. There was something in his voice that warned this was a bad time for Shane to get snarky. ""We're making up.  
  
  We'l be upstairs. ""  
  
  Shane actually opened his mouth to say something else, but he suddenly shivered and took a step back. ""Hey!"" he said, and looked up at the ceiling. ""Stop it, Miranda! Brat. ""  
  
  Miranda was. . . wel , the Glass House teen ghost. A real, official one. She'd died here, in the house-sacrificed herself, in the battle with the draug-and now she was part of it, but invisible during the day.  
  
  She could still make herself felt, when she wanted to; the cold spot she'd just formed around Shane was proof of how she felt about his impulse to harass Michael and Eve just now. Miranda couldn't be  
heard or seen during the daytime, but she could sure make her displeasure known.

The book has a few comic pages thrown in, I think it was a story the two girls thought of together.

I had worked hard for my stuff, days, researching and polishing my project, because I do care about my grades a lot. My college isn't good enough, so I need to work on my stuff to get a job.  
Now, there's my friend, let's call him RM, because he's my roommate, is in the same class with me, and have the same professors. It was inevitable that we were so close to each other.  
He is the type to not care much about his grades, because his father's a local businessman, and he is doing this degree just for the sake of it, unlike me, who's very middle class and my career depends on this.  
On the last day of our deadline, RM, without any consideration 'borrowed' my laptop, and without my knowledge, took my project, shared it to himself, made barely any changes to the code, and submitted it.  
Obviously, our professor caught onto this 'plagiarism' and without letting me explain myself and both our projects were flagged, rejected and both were given a 0 for that.

I confronted RM about this, and he apologized. I know he might not have actively sabotaged me because he's just that dumb, but I couldn't let this go. I was pissed beyond reason.  
But since he apologized, I couldn't escalate this stuff.  
I didn't fight, I didn't yell, I just... 'let it go.'  
Except I didn't.

See, RM had this good stage with a girl from another major, AM. They weren't official but it was heading that way. She dropped by our room sometimes, go on for late night coffees, lots of inside stuff in their Instagram. Anyone could tell they both were way into each other.

I had a plan.

I waited for a week before I started executing it.  
We guys have our GC with like 16 people, and it's all close friends and 'same set of people'. You know, 'guy jokes', which obviously are not very SFW and might even be very weird if taken without context or 'humor'.  
I took screenshots of all the weird stuff he talked about, stuff he talked about AM too, like passing comments on her body and stuff, and saved it all.  
I made a burner account with fake IP, email, and took many measures to make sure it don't trace back to me, and I came into contact with her in the DMs.

“Hey, I know you and RM are talking, so I thought you should see what he talks about and how he talks about others. I used to be close to him, but this just rubbed me the wrong way and I felt I should just give you a warning.” \[Attached Photos\]

I sent it to her, deleted everything, cleaned my phone and made no further effort. I already did what I had to.

As expected, for the next few days, RM was stressed, constantly on his phone, calls and messages. I could guess what was happening.  
Slowly, she stopped ignoring him, blocked his contacts and handles, and RM was so confused about the entire stuff.

He started going bazooka in the GC, yelling at everyone about who was the snitch, personally meeting everyone, including me, and at one point, he left the GC.  
Since he was my roommate, he often vented to me, since I was 'clear of all suspicions', and I always made sure he stays frustrated, by giving him vague, dry and stupid responses like, ""Let it go, man"", ""Girls are like that"" and yada yada.

He never figured it out. I was never caught.

He was affected with this so much that his grades tanked even further and he barely made it to the next semester.

Was I petty? Yes. Was it childish? Maybe.  
But was it worth it? For me, heck yeah.

I sometime feel bad for him, but then I open my academic portal, see the 0 and all my guilt vanishes.",6,1755025446.0,confessions,2,1.0,False
1mohqbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mohqbp/should_i_let_go_of_this_friend/,Should I let go of this friend?,"So I met this friend when I was 22, had just moved out of my mom’s for the first time, and was living in a new state with my bf. I am 29 now. Our friendship started off very love bombey. Lots of kind gestures, hanging out tons, sleepovers, making me coffee for work (we met at our job), lending me her car when mine died so I could take my cat to the vet. She would draw me a lot because she’s an artist. Even said “i feel like ive met you before in a past life” while we were chatting one day smoking weed. I had a lot of trauma from my high school friendships. They all ended, one in a particularly harsh way, and i spent my last two years of high school super isolated and depressed. I found it very hard to set boundaries or determine when behavior was bad enough to warrant the ending of the friendship as a result of this. I had a scarcity mindset around friends. Like if i end this friendship, who is to say ill get another in the future? Maybe I will regret ending it.

All this to say, ive tolerated a lot from this friend over the 7 years we’ve known each other. The super closeness and semi lovebombing faded into rude comments, boundary pushing, and inappropriate behavior a year or two in to our friendship. Such as saying my art project looked like generic decor you’d find at target. Talking badly about my boyfriend. Telling her own (awful) bf that she planned to hook up with me while we were high on acid together, which felt like a weird set up to try and take advantage of me while on psychedelics. She invited me to her home to sleepover while her cats were infested with fleas but never told me, and then i came home and gave my cats fleas. She only told me upon arrival when i saw a flea jump off her body, but she didnt explain how severe the infestation was, or else i wouldve just left then. She also moved states a year into our friendship to go live with said horrible bf (who i never spoke ill of despite her doing so to my bf) and i saw she had the same dynamic she once had with me with her new friends in the new state. Love bombing, super close, constantly hanging out. It made me feel as though she is just like this with everyone and she isnt that close to me as she will randomly make it seem.

Her father died also a year into our friendship, and mine died when I was a child, so i felt empathy, and this made me stick around also. I would wave away a lot of the uncomfortable behavior, excusing it on her grieving. I also felt like her shitty bf was another reason our dynamic started getting more negative, so that played a role in my sticking around.

About 3 years into the friendship, i started to drift away. We mutually stopped facetiming each other. I stopped driving to her state to visit her. I stopped sharing personal things with her. I got pregnant, and she visited me once, was distracted the whole time, left after 15 mins to go meet someone else for dinner. I stopped considering ourselves friends at this point. She moved back to my area after i had my baby. I hung out with her a few times, honestly because i was lonely postpartum and needed human contact. We met as childcare providers, so she was good around my baby and respected motherhood, which also felt nice.

I found out upon her moving back her awful now fiance CHEATED on her “a handful of times” for weeks. He decided to tell her the day before the anniversary of her dad’s death. We’re at present day now. She completely blamed the other woman and said her fiance was manipulated into doing it (lol). She then opens her relationship and her fiance has his own gf and she has her own bf but theyre still engaged. The whole situation seems depressing and fucked up to me, but i dont feel that we’re close enough for me to be as blunt as id like to be. She also isnt the type to listen to outside opinions. She does what she wants. I give criticisms here and there to things she says and encourage her to be more critical of her fiance, but thats about it. After she dropped that news on me, i didnt see her for more months. Her cats also once again have fleas btw, but shes staying with her bf and the cats are just home suffering with fleas for months at this point. Im feeling disgusted by her behavior now.

Recently it was my bday. She asks to take me and my child out to dinner and that she has big news and is no longer drinking. I thought maybe she is pregnant, because she mentioned her and new bf talk about kids (i thought this was way too soon and said so, but once again she does what she wants). I agree to meet her despite not really being up to it after having a busy week prior. I figure free dinner cant be that bad. We meet, she has a bouquet of flowers. She tells me she was recklessly driving 100 mph on the highway, after her bf left her to drive her own car home while she was black out drunk. She got pulled over, arrested for reckless and for dui. Im shocked and upset. She is apologizing for being distant and says she wants to hang out w me more and see me regularly. It feels like she is desperately clamoring for validation after reaching a rock bottom in her life, although she isnt framing it as a rock bottom. Just a mistake that lots of ppl make, and she might get sober but maybe not. Her bf also has his own daughter, who is 5, who she tells me awful stories about that make me concerned for how she is influencing this child’s life (she kicked the child out of the bed with her dad, and the dad was hitting the child for crying at bed time). At this point I feel disgusted and sort of used. It feels like she just wants my friendship out of desperation and validation. To feel like less of a bad person, to distract from her mistakes, her horrible life choices. Idk why I keep seeing this person. How much are we supposed to tolerate from friends? I think friends should be there for you in your low moments, but this friendship feels inauthentic and empty. I feel invisible, only a priority when im of some use to her damaged psyche. I had hope she would improve after moving back to the area and finally seeing her fiance is a horrible person, but she instead still defends him, acts unbothered by their fake open relationship, and is now spiraling into addiction and possibly jail time. Do i bother having a true heart to heart, or just cut off ties and move on with my life?",2,1755025444.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1mohq0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mohq0r/my_cousin_sent_me_this_package_before_disappearing/,My cousin sent me this package before disappearing,"The last time I spoke to my cousin was over a year ago.

We talked on the phone for a good forty minutes, reminiscing about our years working for my uncle’s construction company. We laughed about those long days, cramped up from twelve-hour shifts nailing wooden stakes under the Texas sun — the kind of heat that creeps past a hundred degrees and makes you sick of drinking water. We used to joke, dry as the dirt under our boots, about the dumb choices that led us there:

“But you didn’t want to go to school.”

“A pencil’s lighter than a hammer, bro — but nooo, you wanted eaaasy money.”

It was the only way to cope with the grind. Where formal education had failed both of us, we figured life was teaching us how to become real adults. But as fond as the memories were, bills and debt started to fan a bigger flame the older we got. He wasn’t the goofy kid who collected Hot Wheels anymore, and my dream of becoming a comic book artist had faded — my fingers would go numb just holding a pencil after a long day.

Eventually, our paths forked.

My early-onset life crisis pushed me toward a desk job and something resembling stability. He, on the other hand, moved back to his hometown in Mexico — a place where the American Dream wasn’t grinding his back into dust, and his family’s land waited with open arms.

“I’m glad you’re doing good, bro.”

I missed him. But hearing about his slow days — where schedules didn’t matter and every sunset came dressed in orange-pink light and the smell of home-cooked food — made something in me settle.

He’d found a kind of peace most people never do. And even though I was still grinding away, part of me felt proud — like one of us had made it out.

“Yeah…” he laughed. “I don’t know, man. It’s not like how everyone says. I mean, it is. I just… can’t remember the last time I got up at five in the morning.”

“Shit... sounds like a blessing to me.” I rubbed my eyes. Sunday night anxiety was already crawling up my chest.

“Kinda miss it. The constant buzz. It’s nice and quiet here… too quiet. It’s been…” He paused. “…four months. Well, almost five. Still not used to it.”

There was a hint of unease in his voice. I wish I’d pushed more, but I was tired.

“Sounds like paradise. What about the nosy family?” (That was a running joke between my mom and uncle.)

“Ha, they’re not that bad. Lots of juicy gossip though. Hey man, I know you’re tired. Thanks for catching up—”

“What? No, man. I’m good.”

“I can tell you’re tired. Get some rest, dude. You got work tomorrow.”

I could hear the smile in his voice.

“Don’t remind me... but alright, big dog. It was great talking to you. Let’s do this again sometime.”

We said our goodbyes. And even though we meant well on both ends of a long-distance call, life got in the way. If I had known what he was about to discover... I would’ve never hung up.

---

A week ago, I received a package from an old family friend who had just returned from a vacation in Mexico.

It wasn’t unusual. These trips almost always yielded packages from family members down south — usually fruit sweets, spices, ingredients, or other handmade goods. She said it was from my grandmother and my cousin, entrusted to her about two weeks before she left.

I figured if it had been anything edible, it might’ve spoiled by now — but I thanked her anyway and paid for the delivery.

When I set the package on my desk and saw how carefully it had been wrapped, a wave of guilt crept over me. Here was something they’d put together with me in mind, something lovingly curated… and I had nothing to send back. It made me hesitate to even open it — like tearing into it would cheapen the effort.

Still, I picked up my box cutter, sliced through the tape, and peeled back the cardboard flaps.

Inside was a worn leather journal with a bronze clasp. From beneath the cover peeked several yellowing letters. In the corner, tucked snugly in the folds, was a small flash drive.

The hell…?

For a second, I wondered if this was even the right package. Maybe the journal was actually a Bible — that would make sense if it was from my grandmother.

But the flash drive?

That had to be from Bello.

I took the journal out. It was heavy in my hands — overstuffed, practically bursting at the seams. The clasp looked like it could barely hold another page.

I unlatched it.

As soon as I did, the journal sprang open and the first of many letters slid out and scattered across my desk. This one looked more recent than the others.

It was addressed to me. My cousin’s terrible handwriting was unmistakable.

---

Letter 1

Hey Miguel,

If you haven’t already guessed — it’s Bello. I know sending a letter isn’t something we’ve ever done, and it’s been a long time since we spoke, but I don’t think I could unpack everything I’ve experienced over a phone call… or even a message.

Besides, reception’s been getting worse. The only explanation I’ve come up with is that the layout of the land causes interference.

The last time I tried calling you, it turned into a two-hour trip into the city. Halfway there, I had to switch to a different convi. Trust me, they only look like transport vans. Inside, the smell of gas mixes with sweat, and the whole tumbling ride becomes more upsetting the longer you sit — trapped in an aluminum cage with half a dozen travelers, the more unfortunate ones standing.

The only thing that stood out — the defining and terrifying part — was a dust-caked window. Through it, I watched the winding road twist through the highs and lows of the mountain pass.

More than once, I dug my nails into my arms as the gravel path curled around the edge of a massive, plummeting ravine.

“Fear” is too small a word for what I felt then. And “awe” doesn’t capture the weight in my stomach.

I mean, seriously… how would you describe a giant evergreen god — its maw grazing the sky while its roots cascaded far below your line of sight?

You can’t.

Most of what lies in the belly of this place is unexplainable at best.

I’m sorry, cus. I know I sound crazy. But I’ll try to show you why.

It started with a nightmare.

A month or so after I called you — on a warm midnight, while the frogs croaked under the moonlight — I was lying in bed.

My pillow was propped against the wall. I had been drifting in and out of sleep.

I think I was mulling over something I had to do in town the next day — something about the plaza. I held onto that tangent for a few minutes, my eyes on autopilot, tracing the grooves in the old walls of the house.

Bumpy. Uneven. Casting shadows…

Moving shadows?

The wooden frame, dry and crooked.

Then the window, its dirty glass.

What happened to the frogs?

Then my body recognized it before my eyes did. A jerking, crashing shudder erupted in my gut.

There, on the other side of the glass directly across my feet— a pair of pupils swam out of the dark.

Bold and round, superimposed on manic, animal-whites — unblinking. Staring at me. Through me.

Beneath the eyes — almost a foot lower — a gashing, gummy mouth curled upward, but never touched the eyes. As if the mouth was separate.

I could barely make it out through the night, but I did. It wanted me to.

It had no other features. No nose. No expression. Just eyes... and that smile.

I can’t forget how it never reached the eyes

From it crooned a horrible, pained mewling.

It was muffled by the wall between us, but the sound resonated around the outside of the house — like a chorus of dying animals, all crying wildly the way animals do. Like a call. A feral signal.

I couldn’t feel my feet. My hands were locked onto my quilt.

Adrenaline thumped in my ears, begged me to move —

And then it spoke.

“Mírame… niñoooo…”

“Look at me… child…”

My teeth clenched. At first, the voice was wet and high-pitched. Then it dropped several octaves. It grooved somewhere in between — jagged and unstable.

The toothless jaw began to slowly unhinge. Melting. Flapping in counter rhythm.

Four words — four — translated into five or six impossible mouth movements. Disjointed. Unnatural. Like a broken cabinet door in the wind.

The last one stretched the jawline so far, it vanished beneath the window frame.

I didn’t even realize it spoke in two languages at once — but deep down, I know it probably spoke in every comprehensible sound imaginable.

Then a tongue swung out — slow and heavy — waving like a pendulum, twisting like a snake, movements all to its own.

Flecks of something black sputtered against the glass and the shadowy outline shook eagerly, laughing like rocks slapping water.

 then it said:

 “Nonononosotrossssssss te-e-e recordamoooooossssss—”

weweweweweeeee rem-em-em-member youuuuuuuuuu—

The pitch danced up and down like a broken siren, stressing the last word —

“Regresa al… Aarrrrbooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooollllllll—”

go. back. to. the. treeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee—

It held that last word like it had no end.

A deep vibrato that drilled into my head.

And somewhere in that unbroken sound…

It started to sob.

And then to crow.

And moo.

And bleat.

And all the frogs screamed in chorus.

Relentless.

Louder and louder and louder—

And then I woke up to the sound of screaming. I shot out of bed, choking on my spit. Coughing. Gasping. My throat burned as if it was on fire.

Daylight shone through the cracks of the wooden house.

Tears ran down my face.

…

I set the letter down.

The paper had blotches where it had crinkled and dried. 

Bello…what is this…? What's wrong?...

I paused and went to make a coffee. After reading the first page, I needed something warm. The cold in my room had crept into my bones, and whatever Bello had conjured in his dreams was now floating in my imagination — the same powerhouse that once let me draw comic book characters in motion was now sketching dark shapes in the corners of my vision.

Near the windows…

Behind the hallway doors…

There could be anything.

Anyone.

“Nope, nope, nope. Fuck that.” I shuddered, shook it off, and laughed nervously. I set my mug down, letting the steam blanket my face.

I took a deep breath.

The next page was free of stains, and the handwriting had steadied.

---

That was only the first of the nightmares. For a while, I sported heavy bags under my eyes — I just couldn’t bring myself to sleep, not if I had to relive that moment again and again.

Naturally, Abuela Pachi noticed. One afternoon, while we were feeding the turkeys, she looked at me and said I was starting to look like a mapache.

Can you imagine how dark the circles around my eyes were if she compared me to a raccoon of all things? But it wasn’t without concern — she sat me down, and over a cup of tea, I told her about the nightmares. You already know what she said. It’s what she always says, but under my condition, I felt more inclined to listen.

 “Ay mijo, ¿sabes lo que necesitas? ¡Una barrida! Esos sueños son porque algo… alguien te está haciendo ojo, echándote las malas vibras.”

""Oh honey, you know what you need? A cleansing! Those dreams are because something… someone is giving you the evil eye, sending you bad energy.""

Her eyes twinkled with excitement when she said this, and her many wrinkles formed a simple smile as if she'd revealed the cure all to every ailment and was happy to share it. At the time I couldn't help but think that as humans get older the prospect of doing anything, just for the sake of doing it becomes thrilling.

Afterwards, the conversation shifted to the usual Bible study — sins, satan, the world’s darkness, and how this new generation was lost and that all signs pointed to the end times. I wanted to tell her that the end times had been coming since my own parents had been kids. But this is abuela and you know how it is.

That same evening, she laid me down on a cot in front of the fireplace. It was worn and covered in quilts, it looked as if one hard smack would undo endless generations of dust bunnies. The flames crackled, throwing waves of warmth against the cool air of the kitchen. The building was more like a giant oven, a  brick shack, whose interior was painted black from all the soot. Birdsong chirped through the makeshift door and the leaves rustled in whispers. All the rooms here are old, from a time when hardened mud made a good enough floor.

She lit several scented candles; their smoke coiled upward, filling the room with an earthy, herbal perfume. It made me nauseous. 

She began with a prayer —

""padre nuestro…""

""Our Father…"" 

She passed a set of branches bound in twine over my body, sweeping them in slow arcs, the twigs barely brushing. A deep drowsiness crept over me. 

""Santificado sea tu nombre…""

""Hallowed be your name…""

The heat from the candles suffocated the room, pressed against my skin, and sweat beaded across my forehead. The whole experience was starting to feel like a fever.

""Te pido, Dios mío, que perdones nuestros pecados y…""

""I ask You, my god, to forgive our sins and…""

My eyes were closed. I never noticed when she set the broom aside. Then — the cold curve of an eggshell kissed the center of my forehead. I became that center point. And only slightly wondered why the egg was so cold.

"" …y que limpies toda la maldad de Bello…""

""…And that you cleanse all the evil from Bello…""

At that moment all the birds lost their voices while her words echoed. The sound of the fire vanished, taking with it the scent of herbs and wax.

I was plunged into darkness. My stomach knotted as if the cot had been pulled from beneath me. I felt as if I had fallen off the edge of the world. Into a mouthing ravine, into an abyss.

And once again, I found that I couldn’t feel my arms… or my legs.

…

I’d fallen into a body that felt like mine—only smaller, lighter, twitching with life.

Do you remember how big the world felt as a kid? When adults were giants, voices louder, and the simplest things seemed impossibly grand… and a little terrifying? That nostalgic but distorted perspective?

I was kneeling in a deep pool of a shadow. In my hands—an old friend. My favorite toy: a plastic Spider-Man, its limbs bending at more joints than any figure I’d ever owned. I used to spend hours posing the battle-worn Spidey after watching the movie for the umpteenth time.

Scattered in front of me were other relics of that age: a grimy stack of Play-Doh shaped into something abstract but human. A handful of marbles; small red ones that all the kids would refer to as diablos and bigger multicolored ones that caught light like trapped galaxies. There was also a scratched race car, white with a red M on the hood. I’d dropped into the middle of some grand story my eight-year-old self had been spinning—one of revenge, loss, and impossible stakes, where Spidey would, of course, emerge triumphant.

The air smelled of firewood and corn. Across the dirt yard, the wooden house stood newer but familiar. The tree line surrounding our home was as it had always been—dense, towering, and dark at the edges.

My younger self turned back to the toys—

“Bello.”

The voice was soft and almost child-like, but it was wrong, a facade and it was close.

I looked toward the yard, scanning the house. Nothing.

Then—laughter. Thin, high, and cutesy. It drifted from my left.

I turned. At the edge of the woods, half-hidden in the green, two children peeked from behind a cluster of bushes. They were smiling. Their faces seemed like masks or as if they belonged porcelain dolls, the features were grotesque the way they sat atop their thin bodies.

They didn’t blink.

“Bello! Come play with us!”

It was strange—their mouths never opened, they just kept on smiling. A cold, hollow feeling swept over me, but my younger self rose to his feet.

Their white faces seemed to glisten now, and their eyes were infinitely black and twinkling through the foliage.

Spidey slipped from my hands, clattering against the marbles. The glass clicked and rolled, the sound unnervingly loud in the still air.

The sound momentarily broke the trance and my younger body glanced down, I felt helpless, a disembodied audience watching as the camera lost sight of the clear danger.

“Bello… Come with us…”

When I looked again, they were farther away—deeper in the underbrush, perfectly still, mischievously peeking around the trees.

The smiles curled with malice. 

My body drifted toward the grass, each step sinking deeper into a cold I couldn’t shake. The children kept retreating, now swallowed by the woods. Maybe my younger self couldn’t see it at that impossible distance — but I could: their pale moonlike faces were warped, their smiles torn open into drooling crescents.

I lifted my foot for another step when my mother’s arms scooped me up. She pressed my head into the warmth of her neck and ran for the house. Just before the doorway swallowed us, I looked up—

Spidey stood upright, stiff as a marionette, beneath the clawed shadows of branches veining out from a massive tree. The strange part was that even from this angle I couldn't see  said branches. It made it look more like an obelisk, Its bark was the color of ash. Its roots gripped the earth like the stone talons of a giant.

Then I was raised from my younger body, my soul hovered above the land. In seconds I reached the clouds and watched as the earth became a sea of green that swayed with life. From it rose a single entity in an ominous over bearing shape. It was the ashen trunk, still there as I kept on rising higher and higher, past the clouds and into the navy blue firmament. The tree seemed to tower even here, its branching crown out of sight. As I reached the midnight zone above, all the noise from the world dissipated, a faint echo rang in the hollow silence beyond the world.

“Go. back. to. the. Treeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-”

…

I woke up in the dim kitchen, muscles tender, the scent of wax filling my airways again. Abuela was there. It felt like no time had passed at all. Outside, the birds still sang, and the leaves kept rustling as if nothing had happened.

When the cleansing ended, we sat outside watching the turkeys in the yard, their hatchlings trailing close behind the mother. I let the quiet settle in before speaking; my head felt heavy, as if I’d shaken off a sudden cold, the weight still pressing at my temples and clogging my sinuses. My thoughts moved through fog until I finally asked if she remembered a time, when I was a kid, that I’d almost wandered into the forest.

To my surprise, she nodded.

""Hubo una vez cuando tenías siete años. Ya casi te llevaban los duendes”

 “There was a time when you were seven,” she said. “The duendes almost got to you.”

It took a second for her words to sink in. My eyes stayed on the turkeys and hens as they herded their young across the yard, stopping now and then to stand alert before pecking at the dirt.

“Los duendes?”

""The duendes?""

“Sí, bueno, eso decía tu mami — que los vio entre los árboles. Unos monitos que te estaban hablando, y ya casi los seguías por el monte.”

""Yes… Well, that’s what your mom said — she saw them in the trees. Little creatures, talking to you. You were just about to follow them into the hills.""

“Hay que tener cuidado con los niños por estas partes. Siempre hay unos que se pierden y ya no regresan. Los que sí regresan… como tu tío David. ¿Te acuerdas de tu tío? Cuando era niño dicen que se lo llevaron, y cuando volvió días después, estaba todo rasguñado y sucio.”

""You have to be careful with children around here — there are always some who get lost and never come back. The ones who do, like your uncle David… Do you remember your uncle? When he was a boy, they say he was taken, and when he came back days later, he was all scratched up and dirty.""

A shadow swept over the animals. Instantly, the mothers spread their wings over their young, standing rigid, eyes fixed upward. Abuela rose quickly, snatching a rock.

“¡Ay va ese gavilán otra vez!”

""There goes that hawk again!""

I watched the shadow drift across the yard, wheel above us once, then vanish toward the trees.

“¿Qué dijo mi tío cuando regresó?”

""What did my uncle say when he came back?""

She studied me for a moment, her expression shifting as if she were deciding how much to share. Then she said—

“Oh sí, pues, ¿qué crees? Dijo que sintió que se había ido por un ratito… y luego regresó. Todos estábamos bien preocupados. Lo buscamos día y noche.”

""Oh yes — well, guess what? He said he felt like he’d only been gone for a little while, and then he was back. Everyone had been so worried; we searched for him day and night.""

We sat outside for a while longer before heading into town to run errands.

Miguel… nothing in this town is right. What I experienced — and I need you to believe me — is just one of many things that happen here. There’s something… powerful, and dark, holding onto this place.

While I was in town, I decided to buy a journal. I’m going to write everything down, and try to make sense of it. Someone has to. If I don’t, I’ll lose my mind.

This will be for you.

Once you’ve read through it, maybe we can figure out how to get it into the hands of the public.

P.s - Abuela found this picture of the yard with the tree. That’s my mom and I. I miss her so much. She won’t be around to protect me this time. Wish me luck.

So here I am. I’ve tried calling Bello over and over — nothing. No answer. No sign of him in town. I got through to Abuela and she said he’d gone into the city.

All I can do now is carry on his work. I’ll keep you updated, upload everything he documented. There’s a lot — too much — and I don’t know how much of it is true.

But after everything I’ve read… I believe him.

I'll post the rest of the journal when i can.",1,1755025425.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mohn95,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1mohn95/stillpoint_lodge_alaskatrip_report/,"Stillpoint Lodge, Alaska--Trip Report","Last year, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/s/pKneZdo3Eu) about chubby Alaska adventure lodges. This June, we went to Stillpoint Lodge in Halibut Cove.

We paid $6300/night (or, as all the lodges up there like to do, $3146 pp, which really does not make the cost feel any lower), and I realize some of you are like, why is this post in \*chubby\* travel, come on. It’s pretty far from our usual per night spend ($1-2k ish), which can easily set us up for disappointment. If I’m annoyed and uncomfortable on a trip that feels like a stretch, all those “not worth it” feelings are magnified tenfold. I am delighted to report that Stillpoint is completely worth it. The trip was pure magic, we absolutely adored it.

**Why we chose this trip**

My wife and I wanted a relatively quick trip for a milestone birthday. We are still working and can’t spend three unplugged weeks exploring and adventuring to our hearts’ content. We wanted a trip without a crazy time change (to facilitate working remotely and since we weren’t taking much time, to not waste time with jet lag), with plenty of outdoor activities, beautiful views, and chances to see wildlife, and to be really comfortable the whole time. Alaska fit the bill for obvious reasons, but also because it’s very common and easy (if expensive) to take floatplanes around, which means you can see a lot in a short amount of time.

**Pre arrival experience**

Stillpoint has an absolute rockstar named Beka who will answer the phone or reply to email queries. She can answer any questions you have, and help plan many parts of your trip around getting to and from the lodge. I always wonder if someone in this sales role will over promise and the actual experience will under deliver, but that is just not true here. We were interested in Stillpoint because it’s on the water, and we love going out on boats, kayaking, ocean views, getting the chance to see sea creatures, but it feels like a miss to visit Alaska and not spend any time in the mountains. Stillpoint arranged a flight tour of Denali before we arrived at the lodge, and we seriously lucked out. The weather was clear enough for us to really see the mountains, including Denali (I am also relieved to report that every single person we spoke to referred to the mountain as “Denali”). Once in the air (there is a whole floatplane airport next to the regular Anchorage airport!! It was so cool!), you very quickly leave behind any semblance of civilization as I know it. No roads, no electricity lines, no cell phone towers. You can see moose and bears from the plane. Alaska is wild in every possible usage of the term, in the best possible way.

**First evening at Stillpoint**

After refueling in Anchorage, we got back on the float plane to head to Stillpoint. It’s in Halibut Cove, only accessible by float plane or boat, about 5 miles across the water from Homer, AK. You can take a commercial flight into Homer and Stillpoint will send a boat for you, or you can fly right in, like we did. We loved getting that aerial view to understand exactly where we were (I was full of questions for the pilot), which really helped with understanding the lay of land the rest of the trip. 

Here is the true perk of shoulder season travel: we were the only guests. We went on specific June dates because of my wife’s birthday, even though July/Aug are high season, and were rewarded with what we refer to as the “accidental billionaire buyout”. Since we are traveling around work and family schedules and not just purely at our leisure, we sometimes wind up being the only guests at small properties like this, and we love it. There’s so much privacy, and it feels like everything is for you. Stillpoint even rearranged the dining room so there was just the one table at dinner.

They also gave us a generous upgrade. The price I mentioned above was for their smallest, cheapest cabin, and they gave us a two bedroom cabin set up as a suite (living room/workspace in one room, bedroom in the other). 

**Bear viewing!!**

This is the main reason we chose Alaska: to go hang out with brown bears. One of the reasons we chose Stillpoint is because they recognize that the reason you go to these remote lodges IS to go out and do cool stuff, so the excursions are included. Since we stayed 4 nights, we got two included excursions, and bear viewing was at the top of our list. A float plane picked us up at the lodge’s dock. We didn’t pay extra for it to be private, and the GM, Zach, was celebrating his anniversary and he and his wife joined us, as well as an employee doing the excursion as a training exercise. To be perfectly honest, the young trainee was a bit like having an unattended child along for the day, but going in a group like that was really fun. The flight to Katmai National Park is, wait for it, absolutely gorgeous, and we landed on some water where the bears were hanging out. We spent some time walking around to get into the best viewing position, and then hung out in the meadow for awhile, watching the bears, and eating the picnic lunch Stillpoint had sent (the cookies in the lunches are next level, I don’t understand how they make them so good, is it bonkers to go back to Alaska for cookies??). We watched a bear telenovela unfold, with two bears mating and one very agitated bear crossing the water to go break it up and think about starting a fight. I’d been so focused on seeing bears that the beauty of the land surprised me—I don’t know that I’ve ever been in such a lush meadow before. It looked like it was an animated drawing of a meadow, and walking through it was a little trippy. 

**Glacier kayaking!**

The next day we did our other included excursion, and we chose the glacier kayaking. You have to take a boat to the trailhead, and then hike a ways to the glacier lake, where the guide with you will inflate the kayaks, and then you go out on the water and paddle around to your heart’s content, or, in our case, until the glacier starts making scary noises and the guide says it’s time to turn back. This is a heady mix of things we love—boating, hiking, kayaking, not doing any of the prep or dirty work—and we adored the day. While it's at a public park, we arrived on the lodge's boat well before the public boats drop off, and only two lodges are allowed to kayak there, so we had a remarkable amount of privacy. It’s the coldest kayaking I’ve ever done. Glaciers have something called katabatic wind—basically, an icy wind blows off the glacier towards the glacier lake at all times, and not only is it chilly, it makes for hard work to paddle against it. When we got back to where we started, the guide made a fire and gave us our lunches (MOAR COOKIES, omg), and when we were fed, rested, and warmed up, we did the hike back to where the boat was waiting for us. 

If you are not super outdoorsy but willing to try this, they really do make it as easy as possible. There's tons of high quality gear to borrow. You don’t have to carry a pack if you don’t want to. If you’re worried about using the bathroom being in the wilderness all day, they have little comfort kits to make it as breezy as possible.

**The birthday!**

On Beka’s advice, we front loaded our stay with the highest priority excursions in case anything had to be rescheduled due to weather, but Mother Nature spoiled us with gorgeous, clear summer days. We heard from a couple of pilots that May/June has much better weather and visibility than July/Aug, another reason to go in the early part of the season. So, on my wife’s actual birthday, we basically had a free day, and asked to go out on the boat and explore. In a small example of the staff to guest ratio, they sent a captain, deckhand, and guide with the two of us for the day, and we cruised around to visit seals and otters and look for whales (no luck with whales, but we did fly over a pod of orcas coming back from Katmai), and went into Seldovia for lunch, a tiny town only accessible by boat or float plane. It surprised me to learn that “all inclusive” at Stillpoint included lunch at a restaurant, as they picked up the tab there, and when we went into a coffee shop for drinks. They also didn’t charge us for the additional excursion that day, even though we must have burned through hundreds of dollars worth of fuel. Their eagerness to show us the area and make the day special for my wife’s birthday was so touching, because virtually anywhere else, the property would have happily designed a custom excursion at resort prices for the occasion. 

**The food**

I know I can’t shut up about the cookies, but I have to comment on the food program as a whole. They took note of everything I said pre arrival (my wife has a dairy allergy and never felt sick our entire stay, which is super important), and it felt as though our dining experiences crescendoed throughout the stay as they listened and paid attention to us and kept dialing into our preferences. I’ve never experienced anything like it, and I can’t imagine being unsatisfied (unless a guest were being unreasonable about a timeline; obviously procuring ingredients can take some time given how remote they are, but with enough notice, I think they’d make anything you want). A small example: we don’t drink alcohol, and I asked if they’d have some kombucha around. It’s a nice cool drink to enjoy on a summer day. They bought every single flavor and brand of kombucha available in the store, and got growlers of kombucha at a Homer brewery. Our mini fridge in the cabin was full of kombucha, as well as my wife’s preferred nut milk for coffee. This eagerness to delight pervades every aspect of the experience.

This has gotten so long, and I could rave for another three paragraphs, easily, but I’ll pause here. Some people have acted politely baffled that we didn’t pick an international destination, but considering the 7 hour flight, gorgeous landscapes, and unique offerings, the location certainly felt special, and choosing Stillpoint as our home base/magic organizer made it into the milestone celebration we’d hoped for. I’d recommend it to anyone remotely interested, because I’m so confident that whatever your preferences or needs are, they’ll work with you to make your trip just right for you.",15,1755025261.0,chubbytravel,11,1.0,False
1mohn0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mohn0i/why_choose_the_keurig_kexpress_for_perfect/,Why Choose the Keurig K-Express for Perfect Single-Serve Coffee?,"The Keurig K-Cup coffee maker has been my go-to brewing solution for the past few weeks, and it's safe to say, it’s made an impression—both good and bad. When I first unboxed this Keurig machine, what initially struck me was the modern sleek design that promised to be a space saver. This particular unit, slightly under 7 inches in width, fits perfectly on my crowded kitchen counter—a major win for someone constantly battling limited space. With its lightweight build, moving it around for cleaning or reorganizing required barely any effort. However, the lightweight nature did leave me momentarily questioning its sturdiness, though so far, it’s proven to be durable. 

**Functionality and Brewing Experience**  
Using this coffee maker is as straightforward as it gets. With just a simple button to press and a pod to pop in, a freshly brewed cup of coffee is delivered in minutes. I loved that the machine offers options for three brewing sizes: 6, 8, and 10 ounces. When hosting friends, the customization was a nice touch, accommodating varying caffeine cravings. Moreover, the strong brew setting completely surprised me—it genuinely added boldness and depth to the coffee’s flavor. That said, I would advise caution during brewing. This machine, surprisingly, doesn’t come with temperature controls, and the cups consistently brew on the hotter side. Still, it was nothing a few minutes of cooling couldn't handle.  

**Good Points**  

- Streamlined, compact design, ideal for smaller spaces  
- Fast brewing process—coffee is ready in minutes  
- Multiple cup size options (6, 8, and 10 ounces)  
- Strong brew option adds richness to flavor  

[Check Keurig K-Cup price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0bn9srqt9/)  

**The Reservoir Can Be a Game-Changer**  
One feature I found particularly helpful was the removable 36-ounce water reservoir. Unlike many fancier machines requiring constant refills, this coffee maker allowed me to brew back-to-back cups without stopping. It comfortably lasted for about four 8-ounce cups before requiring a top-up. However, the reservoir's capacity isn’t massive, so heavy coffee drinkers might feel the inconvenience of frequent refills. Even though the reservoir design is simple and easy to clean, you'll notice it’s not transparent. I caught myself having to open the lid often to check the water level.  

**Drawbacks**  

- No transparent reservoir for tracking water levels  
- Lack of temperature control features  
- Might need frequent refills for high usage  

**Compatibility and Customization**  
This coffee maker is more than just a one-trick pony for K-Cup pods. As someone who occasionally enjoys brewing custom coffee blends, I took advantage of the machine's compatibility with Keurig’s My K-Cup universal reusable coffee filter. Yes, it’s sold separately, but the ability to use your own coffee grounds adds versatility. I sampled everything from medium roast to flavored holiday blends, and the results were consistently satisfying. The brewing unit is also compatible with tea pods, so my family could easily switch away from coffee when the mood struck. One thing worth noting: larger pods or off-brand compatibles sometimes didn’t quite sit flush, leading to a minor hassle in re-seating them properly.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Comparing this coffee maker against others in the market, like the Nespresso Essenza Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, gave me a clearer picture of its specific strengths. The Nespresso offers more advanced brewing technology with fine crema layers, though it lacks the versatility and pod-mix flexibility this machine has. Meanwhile, the FlexBrew stands out because it lets you brew single servings or a carafe, ideal for households with multiple coffee routines. Where the Keurig K-Cup machine shines, though, is its fast heating, pod compatibility, and beginner-friendly setup. However, high-end models in similar price brackets do sometimes feel slightly more premium.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
The value this Keurig machine brings lies in its practicality. While it doesn’t have the advanced aesthetic or capabilities of more expensive models, it performs its intended functions reliably. Its maintenance alert system, reminding me to descale the machine after every 250 brews, was a thoughtful touch too. And given the Keurig name, you’re buying into a trusted ecosystem of pods and accessories, ensuring long-term compatibility with evolving coffee trends. It’s safe to say, for people seeking simplicity and speed, this is undoubtedly worth serious consideration.

1mohj6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBikeReviews/comments/1mohj6w/discover_the_cybervelo_ek4_1000w_electric_bike/,Discover the Cybervelo EK4 1000W Electric Bike review that redefines commuting efficiency!,"The **Cybervelo EK4 1000W Folding Electric Bike** came into my life with high expectations, boasting a 1000W motor, foldable frame, and a range of 80 miles. I couldn’t resist the allure of its advertised speed, flexibility, and convenience, so I decided to take the plunge and integrate it into my daily commuting and weekend adventures. After months of testing, I have formed a pretty clear opinion on this powerhouse folding electric bike.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek but utilitarian design. Finished in a clean snow-white color, the 20-inch fat tires paired with a high-carbon steel frame gave it a rugged yet modern vibe. The folding mechanism takes a little getting used to, but it’s practical for city apartments or transport in the trunk of a car. Although not as compact as some travel-specific folding bikes, it’s a fair trade-off for the dual suspension setup, which makes rides undeniably smooth—even on the bumpiest trails. On the downside, the weight does pose a challenge; at close to 70 lbs, lugging it upstairs demands strength and determination. 

**Performance**  
This electric bike doesn’t disappoint when it comes to performance. That 1000W motor (1,500W peak) felt like a beast, delivering impressive power for uphill climbs and quick sprints. In pedal-assist mode, I effortlessly raced to speeds exceeding 25 MPH. For my daily commute, the motor's power was a game-changer, especially when running late for work. However, the throttle control can feel sensitive, and a smoother takeoff would enhance the overall experience, particularly in stop-and-go traffic.

**Highlights**  
- The 48V 20.8AH removable battery is a standout. On one of my longer weekend rides, I managed to push close to 78 miles with pedal assist, proving its claims weren’t mere marketing fluff.  
- Those fat, 3-inch tires are built for versatility; they handled sand, gravel, and even a snowy trail last winter with no issues.  
- The front and rear mechanical disc brakes, combined with EABS, instilled a sense of safety, offering precise stopping power whether on a steep descent or wet pavement.

**Negatives**  
Although I genuinely enjoyed my experience with this e-bike, it’s not without its challenges:  
- The folding mechanism, while functional, isn’t as refined as I expected. Some competitors offer quicker and more seamless folding designs.  
- Weight is another factor—this isn't the most portable option on the market if you rely on carrying your bike up flights of stairs frequently.  
- Assembly required a bit of patience, even with it being 90% pre-assembled in the box. You’ll likely need an hour (or three cups of coffee) to align the brakes and attach the pedals perfectly.

**Product Features for Long-Term Use**  
If there’s one area this folding electric bike excels in, it’s user adaptability. With three class modes and five levels of pedal assist, you can truly make every ride your own. I found myself defaulting to level 3 assistance for weekday commutes and bumping it up for steeper climbs during weekend outings. The intuitive smart LCD display keeps you updated on battery levels, mileage, and speed. There’s even a built-in USB port to keep your devices charged—a small, but thoughtful touch!

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to peers like the Lectric XP 3.0 or Aventon Sinch, this bike offers unparalleled power and versatility for roughly the same price bracket. The Citron E-Bike, for instance, matches the Cybervelo on portability but lags far behind in battery range and motor power. If speed and climbing ability are crucial for you, this bike emerges as the clear winner. However, Aventon Sinch feels a tad more lightweight and maneuverable, which might suit urban riders better, especially those with tighter storage space or frequent travel needs.

**Bang for the Buck**  
From a price-to-feature ratio, this e-bike is definitely worth your attention. It’s not the cheapest in the segment, but its specs—like the hefty 20.8AH battery and a dual suspension system—justify the investment for frequent riders who value power and reliability over ultra-light portability. For those leaning toward budget-friendly models, a respectable setup exists in the sub-$1,000 category. Still, few bikes in that range will come anywhere close to this performance benchmark.

1mohir9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edinburgh/comments/1mohir9/thoughts_on_edinburgh_eating_plan/,Thoughts on Edinburgh eating plan?,"Hi everyone, I hope this isn’t an annoying / overly vague “what are your recommendations?” type of thread. 

Arriving in Edinburgh from Toronto with my wife, kids (ages 9, 6, and 3), and their grandmother on 17 August and staying until 20 August.  Below is what we have in mind for some places to eat, looking for any other suggestions or warnings.  

We like places that are quality but generally not too fussy / serious, ideally independently owned, and not directly / exclusively targeted at tourists; we’ll be spending 10 more nights in Scotland so more focused on uniquely Edinburgh type places or real standouts, rather than making sure we get our fill of cullen skink and haggis, neeps, and tatties (plenty of time for that elsewhere).  Staying at a place in Leith but happy to travel around especially where there are good sights / activities and food in proximity. 

(We are aware that it’s the Festival and have some tickets already in the areas of the old town, Royal Mile, and University).

August 17 - we arrive early after a red eye and will want a quick breakfast before probably a nap.  Thinking something like *Shore Deli* as its close.

We have a Sunday lunch booked at *Ardfern* for late in their window (around 16:30).  Am I missing out here or it’s in the competition?

I will probably get hungry again and may go to *Storries* for a pie.  Would love some *other suggestions for pie* in Leith, old town, and surrounding areas.  I read some old threads but lots of the ones that stood out to me from those (eg, Bains) seem to be either closed or well outside the areas we are otherwise likely to be in.  

August 18 - we have a show in the late morning, so thinking breakfast in either Leith or the festival area.  Was looking at *Toast.*

Then need a quick (or takeaway) lunch somewhere around old town / royal mile.  Best I came up with was *Platform 41 Coffee* but not particularly unique I guess (maybe still great!). Hitting a wall here if you have any other suggestions. 

For dinner, very open to what kind of thing we should try.  *First Coast*?  *Fishers* or *Mussel Inn* (worried Ship on the Shore might be too romantic for three small kids)?  Not totally inspired by those.  We at at the Shoreditch, London Dishoom a decade ago and loved it, haven’t been to one since, doesn’t meet my unique/indeendent/local type criteria but could do that as well if not otherwise inspired.  

August 19, we might do a walk of the Waters of Leith and another show.  In the evening mom and dad have *Kitchin* booked (maybe a drink at *Lost in Leith* before), so looking for something mostly for the rest of the crew for dinner.  They’d love a *great pub*.  Does *Nobles* count?  Another suggestion?  *Oxford Bar* for fame purposes?

To power the kids and grownups through a active days we also have:

I (30M) don't really know what's going on or what went wrong, but I can't help but feel like I somehow ruined her entire day.
Everything started off really good, actually. We had really nice sex, fell back asleep for a bit, then woke up to our beautiful, little cats cuddling with us. I went and got us coffee and went to the store to get her flowers as well. When I got back, everything felt great and light. Then everything went wrong when I gave her her gifts. I had got her 2 dresses, a terrarium for plants, some of her favorite snacks, and a new butterfly clip for her hair. I get that it wasn't a ton, but we've been struggling recently financially. I didn't have much to work with and wanted her to have a good birthday. Between paying for all the meals, plans, and gifts, I had to try and choose carefully, but I think I fucked up. After opening my gifts her entire demeanor changed and became visibly upset. She mentioned she won't ever wear one of the dresses due to the style and that she couldn't wear her other one today due to the material being too warm for her. I mentioned it's all good and I could take them back if she wanted, but she said she didn't want that. She then slowly started spiraling about how awful her birthday was going and how nothing was going right. We had other plans for the day. She wanted to get her lashes done, then we were going to go to an orchard/the beach. She loves the outdoors, so I wanted to do something like that for her. She shot those plans down due to the elweather being warm and not having something cute to wear. As of now, I am planning to take her to her lash appointment then immediately go to get her another dress that wishes will actually want to wear and feel cute in. I just want her to have even a single moment where things feel good for her:(
She has bpd/extreme anxiety and can be very negative. I love her so much and want her to have a good time, but it feels like the more important an event is to her, the more likely she will be to let her expectations sour the moment.

I told my wife that this is weird. But she said he is nice and has no bad intentions. And also she said that she won't stop him from bringing Coffee if he does on his own will. Should I be worried ? What should I be doing? And additional question, would he have bought her coffee if she was a Kuwaiti married woman?

Hence, she doesn't like to stay at my place due to the locality. We are thinking of working towards moving to a different country. Recently, she got her father to buy a visa for me to travel to Kuwait, I tried job searching in Kuwait, found very hard to land a job, still have Kuwait visa valid for another six months.  I had to come back to India as I couldn't stay unemployed in Kuwait for too long. I joined a job here in India and she didn't follow me here.

## Key Features Analysis

The overall candle experience is influenced by the materials and construction techniques implemented to make it.**Wax Blend:** The type of wax used significantly impacts the candle’s burn quality and scent throw. Soy wax is popular for its clean burn and eco-amiable properties. Paraffin wax, while more affordable, may produce soot and a less subtle aroma. Beeswax offers a natural option with a honey-like undertone and naturally cleans the air. Many premium coffee scented candles utilize proprietary wax blends designed to optimize both scent diffusion and burn time.**Fragrance Oils:** The quality and concentration of fragrance oils determine the authenticity and strength of the coffee scent. High-quality fragrance oils capture the nuanced notes of different coffee bean varieties, from the robust aroma of dark roasts to the brighter, more acidic scents of lighter blends. Synthetic fragrances can mimic the basic coffee scent but often lack the complexity and depth of natural extracts.The concentration of the fragrance oil also affects how strong the the aroma is.

**Wick Material:** The wick material affects the way the candle burns.Cotton wicks are a common and reliable option, providing a consistent flame. Wood wicks offer a crackling sound that enhances the candle's ambiance, simulating the sound of a fireplace. The size of the wick directly correlates with the candle diameter, and helps to prevent tunnelling.

**Container Design:** The container serves both a functional and aesthetic purpose. Glass jars are popular for their versatility and ability to showcase the candle’s color. Tin containers offer a rustic appeal, while ceramic vessels provide a more upscale look. The design of the container can also influence the way the candle burns, affecting heat distribution and preventing wax from pooling unevenly.Key features of the best coffee scented candles in 2025 include:

* Premium wax blends for a clean and even burn
* High concentrations of natural fragrance oils
* Eco-friendly wick materials
* Stylish and functional container design

## FAQs Section

Here are some common answers to questions people often have about candles.**how long will the coffee scent last in the candle?**
The longevity of the coffee scent depends on several factors, including the wax type, fragrance oil concentration, and the candle's environment (e.g., room size, airflow). Generally, high-quality candles with a good fragrance load can maintain a discernible coffee scent for the entire burn time, which can range from 40 to 80 hours. Proper candle care, such as trimming the wick and allowing the wax to melt evenly, also helps prolong the fragrance.

**Are coffee scented candles safe for pets and children?**
While most coffee scented candles are formulated to be safe for general use, it's essential to exercise caution when burning them around pets and children.Ensure the candle is placed out of reach of children and pets to prevent accidental ingestion or burns. Avoid using candles with artificial fragrance oils, as these may contain chemicals that can be harmful if inhaled. Opt for candles made with natural waxes and essential oils, and always supervise burning candles closely.

**How can I prevent tunneling in my coffee scented candle?**
Tunneling occurs when a candle burns down the center, leaving a ring of unmelted wax around the edges. To prevent tunneling, allow the candle to burn for a sufficient amount of time during each use, ensuring the entire surface of the wax is melted. This initial burn should take approximately one to two hours, depending on the diameter of the candle. Trimming the wick regularly to about ¼ inch also promotes an even burn and helps prevent tunneling.

Chapter 1  
  
  
My husband went out for a business dinner and came home late at night.  
  
  
I went to greet him and gave him our usual welcome-home kiss, but caught a faint fishy smell on his lips.  
  
  
""Why do you taste like oysters?""  
  
  
""Had dinner with clients at a seafood restaurant.""  
  
  
But... my husband Nash has a deadly seafood allergy—he'll vomit just from smelling fish.  
  
  
How could he willingly go to a place like that?  
  
  
I took his coat with confusion, and a bright red lipstick mark on the collar caught my eye.  
  
  
It turned out that what was full of holes wasn't just his lies, but our marriage too...  
  
  
...  
  
  
Midnight.  
  
  
Nash finally was home.  
  
  
He shrugged off his coat, draping it casually over his arm.  
  
  
The movement stirred up a light breeze, carrying with it the faintest trace of... ocean.  
  
  
Barely, but enough to make me instantly sit up straight on the couch.  
  
  
""Working late again?""  
  
  
I walked over, reaching for his coat.  
  
  
He sidestepped me, tossing the coat onto the couch as he yanked at his tie.  
  
  
""Last-minute client dinner. Couldn't get out of it.""  
  
  
His voice dripped with irritation—all directed at me.  
  
  
I followed behind him, that smell hitting me again.  
  
  
""Is that..."" I hesitated, ""Do you smell like... the ocean?""  
  
  
Nash's hands froze on his tie.  
  
  
He spun around, eyebrows drawn tight.  
  
  
""Just changing perfumes."" His tone was sharp. ""Bulgari Aqva - you don't even know that?""  
  
  
He'd never spoken to me with such raw impatience before.  
  
  
""But you hate—""  
  
  
""Lila,"" he cut me off, his voice turning ice-cold, ""can you not overthink every damn thing? I'm dead tired from work. I didn't come home to get the third degree.""  
  
  
Without another glance, he stormed into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.  
  
  
The rush of water cut off any chance for conversation.  
  
  
I stood there, staring at that expensive tailored suit on the couch, feeling something cold settle in my chest.  
  
  
The Nash I knew... wasn't like this.  
  
  
Back in college, during a club dinner, the second a plate of garlic scallops hit our table, he started sneezing uncontrollably.  
  
  
Within minutes, angry red welts broke out across his face and his breathing got all wonky.  
  
  
We totally freaked out, scrambling to get him to the ER.  
  
  
It was a whole nightmare that lasted until the crack of dawn.  
  
  
From that point on, everyone around him knew he was allergic to seafood—and that it was life-threatening.  
  
  
When we got married, I made it my mission to remember this.  
  
  
Our dinner table was a seafood-free zone, period.  
  
  
But my mom didn't know about this.  
  
  
She came to visit me once, bringing lots of seafood from my hometown of Carmel, and spent the whole afternoon preparing an elaborate feast.  
  
  
Steamed grouper, salmon salad, lobster pasta.  
  
  
When Nash and I came home and opened the door, the rich aroma of seafood hit us immediately.  
  
  
So good\~  
  
  
But the next second I became alert and looked at Nash—  
  
  
Sure enough, his face had turned serious, cold as ice.  
  
  
He froze in the doorway, staring at the table full of dishes from a distance with an expression of utter disgust.  
  
  
""Who told you to make this crap?""  
  
  
Mom was still all smiles, walking up to greet him.  
  
  
""Nash, honey, you're home! Come try Mom's cooking, I promise you'll—""  
  
  
""GET IT OUT!""  
  
  
He suddenly exploded, his voice so loud Mom actually flinched.  
  
  
Before anyone could react, he rushed to the dining table, grabbed the tablecloth and yanked it violently.  
  
  
In an instant, all the dishes went flying to the floor.  
  
  
The sharp, piercing sound of plates shattering made me instinctively cover my ears and scream.  
  
  
""I told you I CAN'T handle that fucking smell!""  
  
  
His eyes were bloodshot as he pointed at my mom. ""Are you deaf? Trying to kill me or something?""  
  
  
Mom went pale as a sheet, standing there speechless.  
  
  
I rushed over to grab his arm, tears welling up.  
  
  
""Why are you screaming at her? She didn't know—she was just trying to be nice!""  
  
  
""Nice?"" He let out a bitter laugh. ""Save it!""  
  
  
That night, Mom locked herself in the guest room and caught the first flight home the next morning.  
  
  
Later, Nash probably realized he'd gone too far.  
  
  
He pulled a Tiffany bracelet from his pocket and awkwardly pressed it into my hand.  
  
  
""About Mom..."" he said quietly, ""explain it to her for me. I really... couldn't control myself. I'm sorry for scaring you all...""  
  
  
I opened my palm—the bracelet was delicate and beautiful, exactly the style I liked.  
  
  
But somehow I couldn't feel happy about it.  
  
  
I comfort myself: He'd lost control in a life-threatening moment, that was all.  
  
  
But tonight, Nash—the same guy who'd lose it over the faintest ocean smell—had somehow managed to wear that scent home.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
The next morning, Nash acted like nothing had happened, casually sipping his oatmeal at the table.  
  
  
I slid his scrambled eggs onto his plate, trying to sound nonchalant.  
  
  
""I dropped your coat off at the dry cleaner yesterday.""  
  
  
""Mmm,"" he grunted, not looking up.  
  
  
""They were pretty thorough—said they detected some weird smell and wanted to make sure it wouldn't transfer to other clothes.""  
  
  
Nash's spoon slowed.  
  
  
""What smell?"" Still not meeting my eyes.  
  
  
""Like... seafood.""  
  
  
""Lila,"" he finally looked at me, his expression blank, ""is this really that big a deal? Worth bringing up over and over?""  
  
  
""You're right. It's not."" I forced a smile. ""Just eat.""  
  
  
He went back to his oatmeal in silence, grabbed his briefcase, and headed out.  
  
  
The whole time, never looked at me.  
  
  
And, it's just a beginning.  
  
  
The next few days, our house felt like a tomb.  
  
  
We kept up appearances—he came home on time, I cooked dinner—but we barely exchanged words.  
  
  
He'd rather watching boring financial news than say even one word to me.  
  
  
I stopped pushing for answers.  
  
  
I knew I wouldn't get any from him anyway.  
  
  
That weekend, I snuck his phone into the bathroom while he was taking a nap.  
  
  
I'd always known his passcode—my birthday.  
  
  
I tried it.  
  
  
The screen lit up.  
  
  
Part of me felt relieved, part of me felt pathetic.  
  
  
I opened his messages.  
  
  
His chat list was pretty clean—mostly work groups and a few close friends.  
  
  
I scrolled through everything, coming up empty.  
  
  
Just when I was about to give up, I suddenly thought of something—  
  
  
His Venmo transaction history!  
  
  
7-Eleven $15.  
  
  
Subway $13.  
  
  
Providence $950...  
  
  
Providence?  
  
  
Never heard that.  
  
  
The transaction time was Wednesday at 9:30 PM—the very day he came home with that fishy smell.  
  
  
I immediately opened Google to search.  
  
  
The page loaded, showing a photo of an elegantly decorated restaurant.  
  
  
It was a Michelin two-star seafood restaurant in Los Angeles.  
  
  
My fingers went numb around the phone.  
  
  
So, that night he wasn't at a business dinner after all—he'd gone to the neighboring city, even to a restaurant he'd be least likely to visit.  
  
  
I kept quiet, just mentally filed away the restaurant's name.  
  
  
Life seemed to return to normal.  
  
  
Nash stopped coming home late, even started making small talk occasionally, asking about my day.  
  
  
But the more normal he acted, the more my anxiety spiked.  
  
  
Friday afternoon, I got a call from an unknown number.  
  
  
""Is this Lila?"" A young, cheerful female voice.  
  
  
""Yes, who's this?""  
  
  
""I'm Sofia, a new intern in Nash's department. Nash asked me to let you know he's got a team dinner tonight and will be home late.""  
  
  
My heart sank. ""Why didn't he tell me himself?""  
  
  
""He's stuck in meetings and left his phone with me. He was worried you'd get concerned, so he had me call.""  
  
  
Sofia sounded incredibly sweet and thoughtful.  
  
  
""Please don't be mad at Nash—he's just swamped with work.""  
  
  
""Got it, thanks for calling.""  
  
  
After hanging up, I stared out the window, lost in thought.  
  
  
I knew Nash's company inside and out—I'd worked there as an accountant for our first two years of marriage—they never let interns handle executives' personal business.  
  
  
Especially not their personal phones.  
  
  
10:00 PM.  
  
  
Nash came home, reeking of alcohol.  
  
  
I helped him to the couch and brought him water.  
  
  
""How was the team dinner? What did you guys eat?"" I loosened his tie while making conversation.  
  
  
""Just... whatever. Random stuff,"" he mumbled.  
  
  
""That new intern seems really sweet—calling to give me a heads up and everything.""  
  
  
Nash's body went rigid.  
  
  
""Oh yeah?"" He closed his eyes like he was about to pass out. ""She's a smart kid.""  
  
  
I didn't say anything else, just helped him out of his shoes and covered him with a blanket.  
  
  
Once he was out cold, I took his phone again.  
  
  
Hell.  
  
  
Password changed.  
  
  
No longer my birthday.  
  
  
I tried our anniversary—wrong.  
  
  
His birthday—wrong.  
  
  
Then, on some crazy impulse, I typed in: 0826.  
  
  
The screen unlocked.  
  
  
That was Sofia's birthday.  
  
  
I'd seen it in the company directory Nash had pulled up once.  
  
  
At the top of his messages was someone saved as ""S.""  
  
  
I tapped it.  
  
  
There weren't many messages, but enough to make my blood turn to ice.  
  
  
S: ""Do I look cute in this dress? \[photo\]""  
  
  
Nash: ""Gorgeous.""  
  
  
S: ""I switched the coffee in your office to Peet's. That no-name brand you had before was so cheap-looking.""  
  
  
Nash: ""Perfect.""  
  
  
S: ""Tonight's dinner is boring AF. I wanna go feel the ocean breeze.""  
  
  
Nash: ""Wait for me. I'll take you after this wraps up.""  
  
  
The most recent message was from thirty minutes ago.  
  
  
S: ""Home safe?""  
  
  
Nash: ""Yeah. She's asleep.""  
  
  
There he was, lying right next to me, telling another woman I was asleep.  
  
  
So the coffee I had personally ground for him was ""cheap-looking"" in his eyes.  
  
  
So he wasn't actually swamped with work—his work just didn't include me anymore.  
  
  
So he could handle the ocean just fine—as long as I wasn't the one with him.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Building up enough disappointment feels like being slowly boiled alive.  
  
  
At first, you just notice the water's a bit warm—uncomfortable but manageable.  
  
  
You tell yourself it's all in your head.  
  
  
By the time it's actually boiling, you're too weak to jump out.  
  
  
I started having insomnia, staring at the ceiling all night while my thoughts spiraled into chaos.  
  
  
Nash's changes became impossible to ignore.  
  
  
He started traveling constantly—sometimes disappearing for three or four days straight.  
  
  
He'd show me his flight confirmations and hotel bookings, everything looking completely legit.  
  
  
But I knew where he really was.  
  
  
Sofia never bothered hiding her social media from anyone—or maybe she wanted me to see it all along.  
  
  
She'd post location tags from whatever city Nash was supposedly ""traveling"" to, sharing scenic photos with loaded captions.  
  
  
""Being spoiled so much, I'm turning into such a princess!""  
  
  
The photo showed a hand wearing Nash's Patek Philippe watch, peeling shrimp for her.  
  
  
Nash.  
  
  
Shrimp.  
  
  
The people and thing that could never appear together were now tightly connected in front of another woman.  
  
  
I threw my phone aside and buried my face in my hands, but no tears would come.  
  
  
I remembered when I had that brutal stomach flu—throwing up and completely dehydrated.  
  
  
I called him with a shaky voice, begging him to come home and take me to urgent care.  
  
  
He sounded annoyed on the other end: ""I'm in a crucial meeting right now. Just call an Uber. If it's not a big deal, don't bother me again.""  
  
  
Later I found out he wasn't in any meeting.  
  
  
One of his friends posted Instagram stories from a music festival, and there in the background were Nash and Sofia—he had her on his shoulders, both of them laughing like carefree kids.  
  
  
Turns out my health crisis was ""not a big deal.""  
  
  
Her fun times were ""crucial.""  
  
  
I became quieter, stopped initiating conversations, stopped caring when he came home.  
  
  
He seemed perfectly content with the arrangement.  
  
  
Sometimes he'd look at me and frown. ""What's with the attitude lately? Walking around with that sour face.""  
  
  
I'd look back at him, wanting to ask what expression he'd prefer.  
  
  
Should I smile and congratulate you both?  
  
  
But the words would die in my throat.  
  
  
What was the point?  
  
  
When your heart's already dead, I guess this is what's left.  
  
  
Two months later, my birthday arrived.  
  
  
I took half the day off and hit Walmart, loading up on ingredients.  
  
  
I figured this might be our last shot.  
  
  
I wanted to try, just one more time.  
  
  
I made his favorite pasta bolognese and beef Wellington. I didn't buy a cake but baked one myself.  
  
  
Maybe this way the chances of success would be better.  
  
  
Right?  
  
  
But I was in the kitchen from afternoon until evening.  
  
  
Until every dish on the table had gone stone cold.  
  
  
He still wasn't home.  
  
  
I called him—straight to voicemail.  
  
  
I curled up on the sofa, pulling a blanket around myself in the corner.  
  
  
Waiting from dark until dawn.  
  
  
Until sunlight came through the window and fell on my face, I picked up my phone to check the time,  
  
  
6:33 AM.  
  
  
I had really been waiting for him so long.  
  
  
I scrolled through my notifications when Sofia's early morning Instagram update caught my eye.  
  
  
A photo from Providence.  
  
  
Sofia was holding this massive rose-covered cake, grinning like she'd won the lottery.  
  
  
Nash stood behind her—his face was blurred out, but I'd recognize that shirt I'd personally ironed anywhere.  
  
  
The caption: ""Thank you for remembering my birthday and celebrating with me.""  
  
  
So he did remember it was someone's birthday today—it just wasn't me.  
  
  
In that moment, the last flicker of hope in my heart was extinguished by this cold, relentless rain.  
  
  
I calmly stood up, scraped all the untouched food into the trash.  
  
  
Including the cake I'd put all my effort into making.  
  
  
Then I called a lawyer.  
  
  
""Hi, I need to discuss asset division in a divorce case.""  
  
  
No more crying.  
  
  
No more trying.  
  
  
Because I finally understood that to someone who doesn't love you anymore, your tears are worth absolutely nothing.

1mohaof,https://i.redd.it/09u27a8wwmif1.jpeg,Curious long term back pain,"I’ve had some issues with my back/shoulders for about 6 months now and wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar. 

I circled all the locations that I have pain. They are all usually just hurting in occasion and mostly not all at the same time. The pain can best be described as an ache. 

Sometimes after I wake up my neck aches. Later when I’m in the car on the way to work it’s my shoulders. Hours later it’ll be the lower flank areas. On occasion it’s right on my spine in the middle. Sometimes when I’m relaxed on the weekends, I hardly notice the pain at all.

Ive tried several remedies. Two doctor visits, bloodwork, dicyclomine, a prescription for IBS, a proton pump inhibitor, increased fiber intake, cut out coffee, drank more water, tried stretches, got a seat and back cushion for my car etc. the pain is still around. 

 Both doctors seemed to think it’s IBS related but my IBS symptoms aren’t bad anymore and I’ve been taking IBS specific medications. None of which help the back/neck/shoulder/arm pain. I think the fact that when I’m relaxed it eases up  could be a clue but it doesn’t happen every time I’m relaxed.

I’m not sure what to do anymore. I’ve tried so many things but it sucks having all these aches every day. Has anyone experienced anything similar?",1,1755024499.0,backpain,3,1.0,False

Video Recaps [Here \(reel\)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNMgHE-OdhN/) and [Here \(post\)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNJ6jkKuvaZ/?img_index=1)

**Background**

I just switched to Powerlifting America, doing a qualifying meet in December.  Prior to this I was competing USAPL for about a year, and USPA for a bit prior to that.  I was competing in USAPL back through 2019, with dreams of one day making it to Nationals and maybe even competing on the world platforms.  However, I suffered a bit of an injury - I have a spondylolisthesis, and this resulted in some crushing sciatica after competing at the USAPL Northeast regionals in 2019.  I received an invite that year to the Arnold Sports festival, having placed 3rd in the region at -93kg with a 707.5kg total.  I took 2 years or so off from training - first there was PT due to the bulging and herniated discs, and then Covid hit and things shut down.  I started training again either late 2021, or early 2022, and did my first competition back in late 2022.  This was an untested USPA meet, but I only signed up untested because it was the only local competition in the timeframe I wanted to compete.  But I made significant progress for this meet, surpassing my old PRs and totaling 742.5kg, at -100kg (99.6kg).  I had put on some weight in my time off, and made good use of that in training the come-back.

I did my first competition as a Masters in October 2023, competing at the IPL North American Championships, and won the -100kg class, posting an IPL tested WR squat in both Open and Masters categories (297.5kg/655lbs), but by this time I had started peeling back weight, weighing in at only 96.6kg.  I switched to USAPL to pursue goals there, sticking right around 96kg, eventually competing at 2024 raw Nationals, and setting the -100kg masters DL world record in the USAPL with a 330kg/727 pull with a 805kg total.  Then I switched to Powerlifting America, with the idea of eventually competing with Layne Norton.  

I won Age Division Nationals, and received an invite to IPF Worlds, which is in South Africa this year.  I had hoped to compete both at Worlds and NAPF Championships, but discovered upon invitation that you can only do one or the other (USA team rules).  So I declined IPF Worlds, because the NAPF Championships happen to fall on my 20th wedding anniversary, and my wife and I really wanted to take the trip to the Cayman's for it.  So I declined World's and accepted the NAPF team spot.

**Training and Prep**   

I am self-coached.  I have typically been running the [Barbell Medicine](https://www.barbellmedicine.com/training-programs/strength/) PL2 program, with PB3 as an off-season program, changing it slightly for my own needs.  But going into Nationals, and again into NAPF, I ran the [RTS High Frequency Peaking template](https://store.reactivetrainingsystems.com/collections/adaptive-templates/products/12-week-rts-high-frequency-meet-peak-template).

These programs are very similar, but the RTS program has a slightly higher frequency of competition lifts, and I really do like the setup of the program.  I had to run a slightly truncated version of this program, since there was a quick turn-around between Nationals and NAPF (9 weeks), so out of the 12 week template, I started in week 3, skipped week 4, and jumped into week 5, and then followed the program from there.  This was largely to use W3 as a deload of sorts, as the D1 primary lifts are a low 75%, and then jumping to 80% in the programmed week 5, I felt this was a decent segue from one meet prep to the next, and it worked really well.

For the first block of this (5 weeks), I also switched one bench day to OHP.  I've been having an issue with my left front delt that held me back at Nationals on bench, and I wanted to reduce pressing frequency, and get some overhead work to address this a bit.  This worked out really well.  When I switched back to 4x frequency, I made pretty decent progress on my bench, though the delt issue is still lingering.

3 weeks out from competition I received my Team USA SBD kit, which included their competition sleeves. In order to accept the kit, I had to commit to wearing the full kit on the platform, so 3 weeks out I switched from Inzer ErgoPro/A7 Rigor Mortis (I typically alternate these) to the SBDs. [ But I filmed a 625 squat in the SBDs](https://www.instagram.com/p/DL3a_Bxu1fD/); I had hit the same weight 3 weeks prior in the A7s, and the bar velocity was identical, and they looked pretty near identical in the side by side video.  That gave me some confidence, as I was a little concerned the SBDs may have an impact on my squat.

This program leads up to a pretty traditional taper.  11 days out from competition I hit my last heavy squats, doing ascending RPE single @7, 8, 9, and actually hit 655 on the RPE9.  This was effectively slightly less than my opener, slightly less than my planned 2nd, and then slightly more or around my planned 2nd.  This was also my last heavy bench day, and I managed to match my 3rd attempt from Nationals at RPE9.  10 days out I hit my last heavy deadlift, and pulled 725 at RPE9.  The rest of that training week was pretty normal, hitting ascending 3s on squat and bench, but on the Friday (6 days out) I pulled back on deadlift, hitting my planned opener, followed by a double at my last warmup.  4 days out I hit my openers on squat and bench, with a last warmup on deadlift.  Monday, 3 days out I ran through my warmups on squat and bench, and then I flew on Tuesday.

I did do a slight water cut going in.  I was weighing in at ~208-210 on average, and need to be under 205.  Sucking down 2.5 gallons of water while flying internationally is not fun, but it is doable.  I didn't manage to get any aisle seats on the trip down, but only had to interrupt someone to let me use the bathroom twice.

**The Venue**   

I am really spoiled, there will never be a meet experience like this one again.  The meet was held at the Grand Cayman Marriott, and all competitors were required to stay there.  When traveling to Nationals, I had signed up for a Marriott Bonvoy card, knowing that it would be where I was staying if I was able to go to NAPFs.  When we went to check-in they noticed it was just the two of us, I had booked a room with 2 queen beds, but they needed the space, so asked if they could upgrade us to a king bed, since we were reward members.  We landed at about 12:30PM, flying out of Maine at 6AM, so really a very short flight (shorter than the Reno trip), and so we had most of the day still.  Our room wasn't quite ready yet, so we ate lunch, and received a call that our room was ready just as we finished eating. They ended up putting us in a room on the first floor, right next to the pool, hot tub, and beach, with sliding door access to the patio.

The temperature never dropped below 80F, and never got above about ~91F.  The water was warm, but cool enough to be refreshing.  The weigh-ins were basically immediately up the stairs from our room, though I didn't find that until the night before weigh-ins.  The competition was held on the 3rd floor, right up the stairs from the hotel lobby.  The warm-up room was on the other side of a divider to the competition platform, with a short hallway in between.  The biggest complaint was that the hall-way windows were facing east, so caught all the morning sun, making it very hot.  I was in the Thursday morning session, and it was very warm for squats and bench, but cooled off once the sun was more over-head in time for deadlifts.

I was in the same session as Russ, so I got to watch him warming up.  Joey Swole was wearing an SBD t-shirt, and I asked him if he worked for SBD (I did not know his face).  Taylor Atwood was hanging around, having competed the day prior.  Both Russ and Taylor are really cool, and very kind.  I also met Matt Vena, and he said yes when I asked if he would sign my squat plug (Taylor aka tater76kg confirmed he really would haha).

The way everything was set up, after weigh-ing in, I was able to go back to my room, and carb up (I brought Elev8 creamy rice, and cooked it in the coffee maker, after munching down a few handfuls of sour patch kids for the faster digesting carbs), and I could have gone to get breakfast in the hotel restaurant.  There was also opportunity to go back to our rooms between lifts - but of course, Russ was lifting, so I stayed to watch instead.

**The Meet**  

I was feeling good and carbed up after weighing in.  I weighed in at 92kg on the dot, and was lucky enough to have the first lot number for weigh-ins.  I almost missed my weigh-in because I didn't realize I needed my passport instead of just my license.  Luckily they had started getting ready to weigh me in about 3 minutes early, and my room was close enough that I was able to run down and make it back up before 7AM actually hit.  Along with my carb snacks, I initially sipped half a bottle of pedialyte mixed with water, until that was gone. Then I mixed the other half of the pedialyte with more water mixed with gatorade electrolyte packets with carbs.  I was back up to 94kg before I stepped on the platform.

This was my first time working with a handler as well.  I worked with Jim and Janel Brown, masters team coaches.  I had sent my attempts  and warm-ups to them a few days ahead of the competition as requested, and Jim had everything timed for exactly when I needed to start warm-ups, which was new to me - I usually just start loading plates and warming up based on feel.  But the method seemed to work. 

**Squat**  
**Opener**: 280kg/617lbs - I'd hit this for a triple in prep, and had no worries here.  3 white lights, moved fast, and depth was great.   
**2nd**: 295kg/650lbs - This is 5kg under my comp PR, I wanted to be a little conservative to save something for the 3rd attempt.  3 white lights. This still moved pretty well for a 2nd, but definitely felt heavy.  We decided to make a 7.5kg jump for the 3rd.   
**3rd**: 302.5kg/667lbs +2.5kg PR - this moved pretty similarly to the 2nd attempt honestly, maybe a little slower.  I could have gone up a little bit, but I was happy to take a PR here   

**Bench**  
This is the lift I usually worry about, particularly for my 2nd attempt.  I do a self-handoff, but after my opener, Jim mentioned my feet were sliding, and suggested I might fix that by taking a hand-off, so I took one for my 2nd and 3rd attempts.  
**Opener**: 163.5kg/358lbs - This moved very well, it actually felt very similar to my last warmup.  3 white lights.  
**2nd**: 170kg/374lbs - This tied my 3rd from Nationals, and was a little hard, but moved pretty well overall.  3 white lights.  
**3rd**: 175kg/385lbs - PR match - Was really hoping for a PR here, but the way 170 moved I think this was the move.  I am not much for grinding on bench in particular, and this moved kind of slow, but never got stuck.  I think it was probably the right call for the day.  

**Deadlift**   
Coming into deadlifts, Jim mentioned that the world record was 328.5kg, and asked me what my goals were.  My planned attempts were 307.5kg opener, 325kg 2nd, and then 335-340 3rd.  I showed him the video of my 10 days out 725 (329kg) attempt, and we decided it was probably smart to take the record on attempt 2, especially given how warmups were moving.  On my 2nd to last warmup (595/270kg) I was back-to the room, and Jim told me the whole rest of the room stopped to watch, and became a little disheartened by the speed.  The 640 last warmup also flew.

**Opener**: 307.5kg/678lbs - 3 white lights. This moved extremely well, and probably could have been a last warmup.  
**2nd**: 328.5kg/724lbs - You might notice I already mentioned this number.  Jim forgot to put in the chip here, and so my 2nd attempt only matched the world record.  3 white lights.  I honestly felt like I could have pulled this for a triple, it moved REALLY well.  
**3rd**:  335.5kg/740lbs - +5.5kg PR - We did stay a little conservative so that we didn't miss out on the world record being too aggressive, but this still moved with fair ease. Almost no slowing whatsoever at any point in the lift.  I easily had another 10kg, except that my hand DID slip a little right at the top.  Luckily I had already locked out before that happened, so not only did I get the down command, but I was able to focus just on holding the grip at that point.  

I ended up with a 813kg/1792lbs total, just 27kg under the current IPF world record held by Mykhaylo Bulanyy since 2016.  I took first in the M1 -93kg category, overall and in all 3 lifts.  
Had I been competing in the open class, I would have been 2nd place behind Russ, 2nd place in the open totaled 812.5kg; but an up and coming junior Demitri Ayala had a massive 863kg total as well (with a 363kg deadlift!), so overall for 93s I had the 3rd highest total.

So overall, a very good competition for me.  I had a total PR of +8kg, 5.5kg DL PR, and a 2.5kg squat PR, while matching my bench PR.  

I am glad to have a long off-season now, as I have been in competition prep since effectively July 2023.  My next competition will be age division nationals in May next year - so time to work on looking more like Russ (that man is absolutely jacked).  Goal is to work on bench, and heal my shoulder. I will be doing a powerbuilding approach to hypertrophy, something like 1 hard set a week with a couple lighter sets on squat and deadlift (like 2x5 at 70%, and a set of 5 at 75-80%), and doing a double-progression on bench in higher rep ranges (sets of 6-10) to start, and slowly lowering rep ranges as I get stuck progressing.  Really going to hit accessories hard, and treat them more like competition lifts for a while, but with higher intensity, since failure is low risk, and then I'll start incorporating more competition lift frequency and volume toward the end of the year. Really hoping to make some progress, particularly on bench, so I can bring the 840kg WR total into reach.",18,1755024375.0,powerlifting,6,1.0,False

I'm fairly new to the practice, with my focus on Ares and Poseidon. I've decided that Tuesdays will be my ""Coffee with Ares"" day, where I'll make some coffee for myself and for him and sit at my small altar and talk with him. The last time I did this it was very cathartic to just talk out loud about the things going on in my life, and asking him to lend me the courage and strength to deal with the things that seem too big and intimidating to tackle.

Anyways, I pulled out my tarot cards to do a single card ""wisdom of the day"" reading, and I drew the Ace of Cups. I felt pretty good about it, and as I picked up the deck again to put it away, a single card fell onto the floor face up: The Lovers.

Amused, I jokingly asked him if this meant he wanted me to make some space for Aphrodite next to him, and I drew another card, this time pulling the Knight of Cups. I had been thinking about Aphrodite in passing for the past few days as I familiarize myself more and more with the gods and their myths, and I know ""mundane over magic"", but even if it wasn't a sign, it was a funny little coincidence. Either way, I will definitely be adding some things for Aphrodite next to his spot on my altar!",6,1755024281.0,Hellenism,0,0.88,False

At first it was through video calls but then in 2024 April we met at his city (we lived in different cities) because I had come there for work and he offered me his place to stay. He was not in a relationship but was seeing other women too and same was for me. We met and we got physical in the three days that I stayed. But in May 2024, when I was in a critical phase of my health, he gave me a hint that he has got committed to a girl, and ghosted me for some months. After that he started liking my stories on Instagram in which I was happy or enjoying my life. I had meanwhile changed my job and city. I found this liking weird and so on Diwali I decided to wish him via a WhatsApp text. He immediately video called me and started talking to me about his issues with his relationship like how they don’t share the same kinks or that his mother does not approve of the relationship. I simply said either to breakup or to talk it out to her, I cant help in this. But we came on talking terms and started off with jokes and all(we have very similar taste in majority of the stuff and we are nerds). But then one day he calls me and screen shares the kind of intimate wear he likes on women. I was weirded out but I continued talking, and after that he asked me to switch to a video call, to which I said that I will call later since currently I am not dressed up appropriately and will call in 5 min after wearing my T shirt to which he said I don’t mind, I have already seen you without anything, which was again weird to me. Then one time he complimented on my physique saying that you have the ideal physique that a guy wants in his girl.

After some time he started getting closer to me than his actual gf. Things were like every gossip or every problem we had we would talk for 2 hours and that I actually at one point knew more about him than his gf. I used my power to tell him that he is emotionally cheating on her and flirting with me which is not right, to which he said that he would rectify it but he did not and ultimately he broke up with her in April 2025. Then on one hand he was sad about his breakup and then in May 2025 when I came to his city again for visit to friends, he gifted me a vibrator and we got physical. On one hand he was showing he was sad, on the other hand he is getting physical and also asking me to set him up with one of my friends. I went back to my place, and the talks continued but this time physical intimacy talks were also a lot of it. Then in July he tells me that he is coming to my city for some work and starts sending me gifts, first a vibrator, then two pendants and finally a watch to which I again get weirded out, why is this guy sending me gifts. Then after some days he tells me that he is getting married to some woman his parents chose for him.

He came to my home in the last week of July, and we visited a famous temple together, and after that I asked him to visit my favourite bar for drinks and there I confronted him, to which he said that he never considered me more than a friend and that he feels guilty of his actions with his ex, to which I said that’s bs. Later on after travelling to my home, we got physical and tried out some things that we both were curious of, but after penetration and release, he just walked away to hall to dress and sleep, leaving me to bed in a vulnerable position which made me feel like I was used and thrown. Then after some time I dressed up, walked to the hall and we talked a but and then he is like sorry we should not have sex any more since he is about to get married. I was like okay fine, and I walked off to my bedroom and closed the door. He came the next day and made me a coffee since i was sick from the pill the doctor had gave me for depression. I took the coffee, didn’t glance a look at him and he went away. I blocked him from all platforms to protect my peace.

Now my friends are enraged at this treatment that he gave me and one is hell bent on telling his fiancé the kind of asshole he is so that she can save her life. Personally I am too heartbroken to care about anyone.",1,1755024037.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False

1moh25n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1moh25n/my_skin_is_rotting_and_no_one_is_noticing/,My skin is rotting and no one is noticing.,"It started with an itch.
A sharp, persistent, dry-scrape of an itch, buried beneath the crook of my left elbow. I scratched until the skin peeled, until I could see pink flesh underneath, raw and tender like overcooked chicken. That was three days ago.

Now the skin has turned gray.

Not just a dull shade of pale or bruised blue. I mean corpse gray. Rot gray. The kind of gray you see in pictures of drowned men pulled out after days in the river.

But no one seems to notice.

Not the barista who handed me my coffee yesterday and smiled like I was a perfectly normal person. Not my coworker, Jenna, who brushed against me in the hallway and didn’t recoil at the smell. And there is a smell now. A sour, meat-sweet stench that clings to me like fog. I smell like spoiled pork and gasoline.

Still, nobody says anything.


---

Day Four

I call in sick, not because anyone told me to, but because I can’t stand how fine everyone else is pretending to be.

I peel my shirt off and stare at myself in the bathroom mirror. My torso is a patchwork of decay. Blackened streaks trace along my ribs. Pustules bubble near my collarbone. I poke one with a trembling finger and it bursts, oozing thick yellow fluid that stinks of bleach and rot.

I throw up in the sink. Blood. There's more blood now than food.

When I finally gather the courage to go to urgent care, the receptionist doesn’t even flinch when she looks up at me.

""Symptoms?"" she asks cheerfully, eyes flicking down to her keyboard.

""My skin is rotting.""

She types something in. ""Fever?""

""Yes. I think. Maybe. I'm not sure anymore. I can smell myself dying.""

""Okay,"" she says, smiling. ""Have a seat, we’ll call you shortly.""

I sit for three hours. No one looks at me. Not the man with the broken wrist, not the kid coughing blood into a towel, not the old woman asleep in a wheelchair. When they call me in, the nurse takes my blood pressure like she’s dealing with a perfectly intact human being and not a walking infection.

The doctor looks at the angry rash spreading across my chest and says, “Looks like dermatitis. I’ll prescribe a cream.”

He doesn’t see the maggots writhing just beneath the surface of my skin.

I don’t fill the prescription.


---

Day Five

I don’t sleep anymore.

When I close my eyes, I feel things moving under my skin—little shifts and scurries like cockroaches racing through a cardboard box. My hair has started to fall out in thick clumps, leaving patches of bald, blistered scalp. The tip of my right pinky finger is gone. Just… gone. I woke up and there was a blood smear on the pillow and a nub of bone where my finger used to be.

No one says anything at work when I show up late, sweating and swaying and visibly rotting.

Jenna asks if I’m ready for the presentation. I tell her I don’t think I can hold a pen anymore. She laughs like I’ve made a joke.


---

Day Six

I try to scream at a stranger in the grocery store.

An old man pushing a cart full of cat food and crackers. I grab his arm, fingers leaving trails of brown mucus on his sleeve, and I shout, “LOOK AT ME! I’M FALLING APART!”

He blinks slowly. “Do you know where they keep the chicken broth?”

I run out without paying for my items. Not that anyone tries to stop me.

My knees buckle on the sidewalk. I curl up by a trash can and cry as bits of my left ear flake off into my hand. A child walks past with her mother, pointing at me.

The mother tugs her away. “Don’t stare,” she says.

Not don’t go near the corpse-man.
Just don’t stare.


---

Day Seven

I decide to test it.

I go to a party. An old college friend invites me out, and I show up. I don’t shower. I don’t brush the thick gray fur growing on the back of my neck. I wear a shirt soaked in bodily fluids and pus. I’m half-decayed and openly weeping from my eye sockets.

No one says anything.

They talk to me about sports, about Netflix, about the cost of rent. One girl flirts with me. Flirts. Her fingers trail along the sleeve of my jacket and leave streaks of rot behind. She doesn't even look down.

I kiss her. My lips crack open like old wounds and something thick leaks out between us.

She moans softly.

I run to the bathroom and puke out a chunk of my tongue.


---

Day Eight

I dig into my shoulder with a steak knife. The skin comes off in a long, meaty ribbon. It feels like peeling fruit. There’s no pain. There’s no blood. Just emptiness beneath. Hollow meat. I am empty inside.

I go to my parents’ house. My mother hugs me at the door.

“You’re losing weight,” she says.

My eye falls out when I blink too hard.

My dad talks about stocks. I sit at the dinner table with my body literally sloughing off in chunks onto the linoleum and no one flinches. My brother asks if I’ve seen the new superhero movie.

I scream at the top of my lungs. My vocal cords snap halfway through.

My family just keeps eating.


---

Day Nine

I visit a priest.

“Father,” I croak, tongue half-missing, throat bubbling with black mucus, “I think I’m dead.”

He smiles kindly. “We’re all dead in some way, my son. That’s what sin does. Eat you alive.”

I slam my rotting fist on the altar and leave a smear of rot and decay on the white cloth. “I mean it literally. My body is falling apart. I’m decomposing.”

“Then maybe you should let go of it.”

I leave. I go to a hospital again. This time I strip naked in the waiting room. People glance at me and go back to their phones.

My foot detaches at the ankle. I limp in circles. I scream until foam pours out of my mouth.

A nurse finally approaches me, puts a blanket around my shoulders.

“It’s okay,” she whispers. “You’re not the first.”

“The first what?” I ask, shivering.

She just pats my back and walks away. Her fingers leave trails of ash behind.


---

Day Ten

I dream of worms. Not metaphorically. Just… worms.

I wake up and they’re crawling out of my nose.

I don’t bother cleaning them. I walk to the park. Sit on a bench. Watch people jog past me, earbuds in, shoes bouncing.

I realize they’re all rotting too. I can see it now. The mother pushing her stroller has black teeth behind her smile. The old man feeding birds has strips of skin falling off his knuckles. The jogger’s face is caved in on one side, like a dried fruit left too long in the sun.

None of them say anything.

None of them seem to notice.


---

Day Eleven

There is no more pain. No more hunger. No more fear.

There’s barely any me left. My bones are poking through. My jaw hangs crooked. One of my arms doesn’t work anymore. The other has too many fingers.

And still…

No one notices.


---

Day Twelve

I walk into traffic.

Not out of depression. Not as a cry for help. Just to see.

The cars slow down.

They stop.

People honk. Someone yells at me. “Get outta the road, asshole!”

I lie down on the asphalt and wait.

Eventually a cop arrives. He kneels beside me. His breath smells like mildew and rot.

“Sir, do you need assistance?”

I whisper, “Do I look okay to you?”

He tilts his head.

“You look like everyone else.”


---

Day Thirteen

I don’t go home. I don’t think I have one anymore.

I sleep in the alley behind a fast-food place. Rats avoid me. Flies circle but don’t land.

A woman steps over me and drops a dollar in my lap.

A dollar.

For what?

I buy a coffee with it. No one blinks when I walk in dripping fluids and smelling like a slaughterhouse.


---

Day Fourteen

I tear open my chest.
I mean that literally.
Fingers in between the ribs, pulling hard. Something rips. Something comes loose.

Inside, I find nothing.

No heart.

No lungs.

Just an empty cavity and a few scuttling things that run away from the light.


---

Day Fifteen

I sit at the bus stop. My jaw detaches and falls to the ground with a clack. I don’t bother picking it up.

A man in a suit sits beside me.

He looks perfectly clean.

No rot. No blood. No decay.

He turns slowly. Looks me in the eye—or where my eye used to be.

“You’re the last one,” he says.

I try to speak but there’s nothing left in my throat but wind and ruin.

He pats my shoulder.

“You held on longer than most. But now it’s your turn too.”

I wheeze something that might be “Why?”

He doesn’t answer.

He stands. Walks away.

I sit for a while longer, the wind whistling through the holes in my body.

Then I fall apart.

Piece by piece.

No one notices.


---

Day Sixteen

A cleanup crew comes through. Men in white suits and masks. They sweep up what’s left of me. Bag it. Toss it into the back of a black van with no license plate.

One of them wipes sweat from his brow.

“Another one,” he mutters.

The other shrugs. “They always think they’re the only one.”

The van drives away.

The sidewalk is clean again.

People walk past.

Phones in hand.

Eyes empty.

Skin rotting.

1moh1su,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1moh1su/find_out_if_the_cosori_pour_over_coffee_maker/,Find Out if the COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker Lives Up to Its 4.7 Rating,"The COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker with Double-Layer Stainless Steel Filter and an 8-cup, 34oz capacity has become a recent addition to my daily coffee adventures, and, honestly, it’s been quite the ride. The product gives off a minimalist, modern aesthetic, while still catering to functionality. I've tested it extensively, brewing pot after pot of coffee to truly get a feel for its benefits and downsides.

**Design and Build**  
Right out of the box, I noticed the quality craftsmanship. This coffee dripper comes with a dual-layer 304 stainless steel filter and a borosilicate glass decanter that's aesthetically pleasing and durable. The wooden sleeve gives a nice rustic touch, plus it doesn't feel flimsy like cork alternatives I’ve tried before. The wooden material remains easy to clean, even if a little coffee spills over it. Trust me, that’s a lifesaver compared to cork handles that soak everything in and wear out quickly. It's lightweight but sturdy enough to sit securely on my countertop, even during my pre-coffee morning clumsiness.

**How It Performs**  
Brewing coffee with this pour-over maker is honestly a therapeutic experience. I love how much control it gives over every aspect, from the water temperature and flow to the coffee grind concentration. The double-layered filter made an immediate difference too—it’s miles ahead of single-layer filters. There’s a noticeable richness to the coffee flavor, and zero ground coffee residue gets into the cup. Believe me, nothing ruins that first sip of morning coffee faster than gritty bits sneaking through.

**Advantages**  
- Durable borosilicate glass that tolerates thermal fluctuations (yes, you can set it on the stove with a low flame).  
- BPA-free materials across the board, keeping your brew safe from harmful chemicals.  
- Dual-layer stainless steel filter that cuts out the need for paper filters while boosting flavor.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts for decanter and filter, making cleanup effortless after each brew.  

[Check COSORI Pour Over Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0821dtmgt/)

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Convenience-wise, I can't complain here. The decanter and the stainless steel filter are both dishwasher safe. Just pop them in, and you're good to go. For the wooden sleeve, I use a damp cloth to give it a few quick swipes, and it's as good as new. There’s no risk of the sleeve deteriorating due to water exposure, which is a huge plus compared to other pour-over devices with more fragile handle materials. Honestly, I was expecting cleaning to be more of a chore, but COSORI nailed this aspect.

**Drawbacks**  
- The manual operation isn't for those looking for speed or automation—this is really for coffee lovers who want to savor their brewing process.  
- While the glass decanter is sturdy, it’s still glass. If you’re not careful (like when juggling between pouring and toddler interruptions), there’s always the risk of breaking it.  
- It requires some experimentation to nail down water flow and grind consistency; beginners might need practice to avoid weak coffee, though this improves over time.  

**Who Is It For?**  
This pour-over coffee maker seems tailored for enthusiasts who want to enjoy the ritual of coffee brewing, whether at home or while camping. If you're in a rush in the mornings or prefer hands-free appliances, this might not be your cup of… coffee. But if you cherish customization, this coffee maker checks all the right boxes. 

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to something like the Chemex coffee maker, which uses paper filters, this one saves money and the environment by relying on a reusable steel filter. Plus, the filter here allows essential coffee oils to pass through, making each brew more flavorful. However, I found that Chemex provides a slightly brighter taste, likely due to its thick paper filters. On the other hand, COSORI trumps Chemex in durability, as you don’t have to replace filters constantly or worry about tears.

The Hario V60 shares similar manual brewing control but can be a bit tricky for beginners trying to get the pouring technique right. Additionally, I find COSORI's spout and wooden sleeve much more intuitive for grip and spill prevention, which Hario lacks. Both offer amazing brews; I guess it comes down to whether you prioritize design or flexibility.

**Affordable Quality**  
For a budget-friendly pour-over system, this one delivers in spades. It’s clear that every dollar goes into making this a durable, user-friendly coffee-making solution. Compared to similarly priced products, its dual-layer filter and borosilicate glass set it apart by a wide margin. Simply put, if you're after rich, bold coffee day after day without overspending, this product fits the bill perfectly.

It’s been too long since I’ve had the kind of night where conversation flows, laughter feels easy, and you walk home with that warm, fuzzy feeling. I’m craving connection.. the real, human kind even if it sounds cliché 

We could grab coffee at a quiet bar, wander through a museum, stay up too late talking about the strange corners of life… or just chill in home with blankets, Netflix, and a little bit of stolen warmth.  

If the chemistry is there, maybe it turns into something more, slow, natural, unforced. I’m not shy about wanting intimacy, but I think the journey to it is just as fun as the destination.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and appeal of a petrified wood coffee table depend heavily on its features. Understanding these aspects will allow you to differentiate between models and choose one that best suits your needs and preferences.

**Wood Quality and Origin:** This refers to the type and condition of the petrified wood used. The origin of the wood can also be a factor, as different regions may produce wood with unique colors and patterns resulting from local minerals present during the fossilization process. High quality pieces display clear, intricate wood grain and vibrant mineral inclusions. sourcing from reputable suppliers ensures ethical harvesting and preservation of these ancient materials.

**Table Size and Shape:** Sizes range from small, accent tables to large, centerpiece tables designed to accommodate a variety of living spaces. The shape can be circular, rectangular, square, or even irregular, depending on the original shape of the petrified log.A coffee table should ideally complement the dimensions of your living area,leaving ample space for movement and interaction. Consider what will be placed on the table to ensure you have enough surface area.

**Base Construction and Stability:** The base of a petrified wood coffee table is crucial for its stability and visual appeal. Bases are commonly made from metal (steel, iron, or aluminum), wood, or even clear acrylic. Metals offer durability and sleek, modern design options. Wooden bases can provide a more rustic or traditional feel. Regardless of material, the base should be robust enough to support the weight of the petrified wood slab safely.

**Finish and Polishing:** The finish on the petrified wood determines its texture and appearance. Some tables feature a high-gloss polish that enhances the colors and natural patterns of the stone. Others have a more matte or natural finish, preserving the rugged feel of the fossilized wood. Additionally, the polishing process should smooth out any sharp edges, increasing safety and comfort for daily use.

**Mineral Inclusions and Coloration:** The mineral composition of the habitat where the wood fossilized plays a significant role in determining its coloration and the presence of unique inclusions. Common minerals like iron oxides, manganese, and silica create diverse hues, from reds and yellows to browns and grays. The presence of agate,jasper,or other gemstones embedded in the wood adds further value and visual interest. Look closely for dynamic mineral patterns, as they contribute to the table's unique aesthetic.

**Sealing and Protection:** Proper sealing of the petrified wood is crucial to protect it from moisture, stains, and scratches. A high-quality sealant will create a barrier that prevents liquids from penetrating the stone, making it easier to clean and maintain. Sealing also helps to preserve the color and appearance of the wood over time. Ensure that the sealant used is non-toxic and safe for indoor use.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about petrified wood coffee tables that can assist in making your purchase decision.

**How do I clean and maintain a petrified wood coffee table?**
Regular cleaning involves gently wiping the surface with a soft, damp cloth. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish. For tougher stains, use a mild soap solution and rinse thoroughly. To protect the surface from scratches,consider using coasters and placemats. Periodically, you may want to apply a stone sealant to maintain its protective layer, especially if the table sees heavy use.

**Will the color of the petrified wood fade over time?**
High-quality petrified wood that has been properly sealed and protected from direct sunlight is unlikely to fade significantly over time. Though, prolonged exposure to UV rays can gradually cause some color shifts or fading. To minimize this, avoid placing your petrified wood coffee table in direct sunlight or use curtains or blinds to filter the light.

**Are petrified wood coffee tables environmentally friendly?**
Petrified wood is generally considered an environmentally friendly material because it is a naturally occurring fossilized substance. However, ethical sourcing practices are crucial. Ensure that the petrified wood is harvested from sustainable sources and that the suppliers adhere to environmental protection standards. Also consider the sustainability of the materials used for the base and any finishes or sealants applied.**What should I look for in terms of size and weight capacity?**
Consider the size of your living space and the purpose you intend the coffee table to serve. Measure the area where you plan to place the table to ensure it fits comfortably and allows for easy movement. The weight capacity should be sufficient to hold items like books, drinks, and decorative objects without straining the base. Always inquire about the base's load-bearing capacity to ensure stability and safety.

1mogy3p,https://i.redd.it/v0o8587lumif1.jpeg,Unusual payment,"To preface this story I'll start with two points: 

1. I strongly believe that random acts of kindness make the world a better place. 

2. I learned how to make origami cranes yesterday - this is my new hyperfixation. I have filled a shelf at home with them, much to my husband's despair.

I was waiting at the train station, as the train that would have taken me home was no longer going my way, so I sat down next to two men outside a coffee shop. All the trains were delayed or cancelled for a variety of reasons (tree in tracks, tresspasser on tracks, driver didn't have air conditioning in the cabin etc).

An announcement comes on about yet another delay, so I pipe up to the two men next to me ""I guess we're playing delay bingo today"".

The three of us had a good moan about the trains, one left for his train, the other man offered to buy me a bottle of water from the coffee shop - I was hesitant at first, but I had a raging headache and it's a stonking hot day for London (we aren't built for this).

So he goes to get water for us - while he's queuing up I pull out my pad of origami paper - guess who's now the proud owner of a paper crane as payment for his random act of kindness!",24,1755023741.0,wholesome,0,1.0,False

1mogwcz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mogwcz,My 3D Printing Espresso Hack: From Annoying Grinder Fumbles to a Magnet-Powered Dosing Cup Holder That Saved My Local Cafe's Sanity,"I've been deep into the world of espresso and 3D printing for about a year and a half now, and I just had to share this project that's been a game-changer for my favorite local roaster. It all started with my own frustration at home—I use a DF64 grinder, and even with the rubber adapter from Turin, getting the dosing cup perfectly lined up felt like a precision surgery every time. One slip, and grounds everywhere. I hated the workflow, so I decided to design a custom holder that would make it effortless.

The idea? Leverage the grinder's natural vibration and a slight tilt in the holder to auto-center the cup as it fills. I kept it super close to the chute to cut down on ejected grounds flying all over the place. And for easy cleaning (because who wants coffee dust buildup?), I went with a blind mount system—no exposed screws or crevices for grounds to hide in.

Then I visited the cafe and saw their baristas wrestling with the standard forks on their DF83 grinder. It was chaos during rush hour, so I adapted my design for them. My first version used friction-fit slide rails, but it was a bit fiddly to remove for cleaning, which they do religiously. Enter magnets! I redesigned it to snap on magnetically—quick attach, easy detach. While I was there, I noticed their Turin dosing cups already had magnets built-in. Lightbulb moment: Why not embed a covered magnet in the print itself for perfect self-centering alignment? It just clicks into place every time. Plus, magnets are just cool—who doesn't love that satisfying snap?

Printed it in PLA (tough enough for daily abuse, easy to clean), and after a few test iterations (shoutout to the failed prints that looked like abstract art), I handed it over. Checked back a couple days later, and the baristas were over the moon. No more fiddling with dosing collars or eyeballing the forks—just drop the cup in, grind, and go. It's streamlined their routine big time, especially during those morning rushes.

Has anyone else hacked their grinder setup like this? I'd love to hear your stories or ideas—maybe it'll inspire my next iteration!",1,1755023641.0,DF83,0,1.0,False

1mogrgr,https://i.redd.it/hshu6kp6tmif1.jpeg,The trap of “feeling like you studied” vs actually learning something,"Now that i got your attention with the self sabotaging meme.

I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve finished a 3-hour podcast or audiobook and thought: wow, that was brilliant.

Fast forward a week. and I can barely recall half of it. Just vague ideas and “smart-sounding” phrases floating around my head. Nothing I could actually explain to someone else or use in real life.

I’m a cadet pilot and psych student, so I’ve learned the hard way there’s a massive difference between hearing something and actually learning it. In the cockpit, you can’t fake understanding. Either the knowledge is wired into your brain and muscle memory, or you’re toast.

# The “I totally get this” trap

There’s a psychology term for this: the fluency illusion. Something feels familiar, so your brain assumes you’ve learned it. The sentences flowed, the examples made sense, you nodded along so you think you “know” it.

Then someone asks you to explain it and you realize you’re just staring into mental static.

There’s also the illusion of explanatory depth: you think you understand something (blockchain, inflation, even how a toilet works) until you try to explain it in detail and realize your “understanding” is basically a sketch with no blueprint behind it.

# Why it feels like progress (but isn’t)

Our brains love novelty. Hearing something new gives you a little dopamine kick like that first sip of coffee. So you can have a podcast on while cooking, hear an interesting bit about sleep or productivity, and feel smarter in the moment.

But it’s just entertainment disguised as learning. It’s not bad content it’s just a bad way to learn.

# The “gym but no workout” problem

This is where passive learning gets sneaky. You feel like you’re working on yourself. But you’re skipping the boring, uncomfortable part where you actually practice or test what you’ve learned.

It’s like going to the gym in full workout gear, chatting about training techniques, taking selfies but never touching a barbell.

# What real learning actually feels like

In flight school, you don’t just watch videos of emergency landings and call it a day. You do them over and over until your hands move before your brain even thinks. That’s procedural memory. It sticks because you drilled it until you were sick of it.

Real learning is repetitive. Messy. Sometimes frustrating. Definitely not something you can absorb while folding laundry.

# Quick test are you really learning?

    •	Can you explain what you learned yesterday in your own words?
    •	Have you actually used it in work, study, training, or decisions?
    •	Did you pause to think/write about it, or just let it play in the background?
    •	Has it changed anything you actually do?

If you answered “no” to most of these, you’re just snacking on ideas not building mental muscle.

# How to make it stick:

    1.	Slow down – Don’t binge 10 podcasts in a week. Pick one thing and go deep.
    2.	Explain it – Write it out in your own words. If you can’t, you don’t know it yet.
    3.	Use it ASAP – Bring it up in a conversation, apply it to a project, test it out.
    4.	Revisit later – Come back to it in a week or two to see what’s still there.

Passive learning feels good. Active learning feels like work. But when life throws turbulence at you in the air, in the gym, or anywhere else only the stuff you’ve really worked for will be there when you need it.",3,1755023346.0,GetStudying,0,0.81,False
1mogrda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1mogrda/he_called_it_true_love_on_our_seventh_wedding/,He Called it True Love | On Our Seventh Wedding Anniversary,"Chapter 1

On our seventh wedding anniversary, the gift my husband Gary Perez sent after standing me up was a newborn still slick with amniotic fluid.

I ignored the wails outside and dumped a table of cold dishes.

Gary called, ""Got the kid? Stop targeting Kathleen Davis now. She even gave you her child—what more do you want?""

""Be reasonable. If you could bear children, would I have sought another woman?""

""The Perez bloodline's hung by a thread for seven generations. Raise mine and Kathleen's child well while I accompany her abroad. I'll make it up with a wedding when we return.""

I answered calmly, ""Fine.""

Then contacted a slum couple in Africa: ""Heard you want to adopt?""

Just then, a message flashed: ""Elizabeth Harris, marry me or I'll die.""

My cold gaze swept the empty house as I replied, ""I will.""

The other party called excitedly, ""I'll pick you up!""

Three years later, due to company expansion, I returned to San Francisco with my child.

Yet at the airport, I unexpectedly ran into Gary and Kathleen, who had just arrived from abroad.

Gary shoved his suitcase toward me as if it were natural. ""At least you've got some sense. How'd you know Kathleen and I were returning today?""

Before I could respond, he frowned impatiently. ""Why have your messages been so incomplete these years? But asking for living expenses? Always straight to the point!""

I raised an eyebrow. When I left back then, I'd casually tossed my phone to a homeless person on the street. Who knew who'd been replying to him?

I couldn't be bothered to engage and threw his suitcase back.

""You've got the wrong person.""

I turned to leave, but then Kathleen saw the child sleeping in the stroller and rushed over in tears.

""Son, Mommy's back. It's all my fault that I met your dad too late, so I couldn't be by your side legitimately.""

Then, she ignored my attempts to stop her and forcibly picked up the child.

The child, who inherited his biological father's grumpiness upon waking, immediately burst into loud wails.

Struggling wildly, his little feet kicked Kathleen in the face.

Crying and calling out ""Mommy"" to me, Kathleen's eyes flashed with panic and jealousy.

I hurried over to take the child back and was about to explain, ""He's not your chi...""

But Kathleen took a step back, crying like a rain-drenched blossom, ""Elizabeth, you clearly promised me that you would take good care of my child. Why is he so thin and small at three years old?""

She then said to the child in her arms, ""It's all mommy's fault. I haven't been with you for three years, never knew you suffered so much!""

I was so exasperated I nearly rolled my eyes. Just as I opened my mouth to say, ""You've misunderstood, he's only two—""

A stinging slap landed across my face. I stared at Gary in disbelief.

His face twisted with rage. ""Elizabeth, I never imagined you'd be this vicious! You promised back then, yet for three years you've abused my child with Kathleen!""

""I've sent you nearly a million in living expenses over three years, and you couldn't even spare proper food for him?""

""Look how thin and dark he's become under your cruelty! This is the sole heir of the Perez family!""

A crowd had gathered around us unnoticed, all rolling their eyes and whispering behind their hands.

Even people held up their phones live-streaming, shouting, ""Come quick, everyone! An evil nanny got caught red-handed abusing a rich family's child!""

Frowning, I watched the still-crying child, my heart aching as I snatched him back from Kathleen.

Chapter 2

Busy comforting the child, I had no time to explain to the crowd. Suddenly, Kathleen screamed, ""Elizabeth, how could you use a Herbal Sleep Pillow for the baby? Don’t you know I’m allergic to it?""

""No wonder he’s so frail! He’s allergic just like me. Elizabeth, didn’t you notice at all?""

""That poor little thing couldn’t speak, suffering silently for three years... After all, he’s not her biological—""

Then she knelt before me, putting on a show of motherly devotion. ""Please give my son back! He’s the child I struggled so hard to bring into this world!""

I thought bitterly about how that newborn had been dumped at the doorstep like unwanted goods, still slick with birth fluids.

Gary and Kathleen flaunted their honeymoon abroad on social media without sparing my dignity, their public displays turning me into the circle's laughingstock.

Had I not heard those wails, that infant would've frozen to death outside.

You couldn't bother feeding your own child back then, yet now you playact devoted parents?

My expression hardened as I placed the baby back in the stroller.

Gary snapped, ""Elizabeth, give Kathleen her child! You can't even handle childcare properly—you're unfit to be Mrs. Perez!""

I smirked, ""Who cares? I've remarried already!""

""Kathleen holds a Harvard master's degree. She's more qualified than you to lead the Perez group. If not for my consideration...""

Gary was chattering away when he finally registered my words, stammering: ""What did you say?""

Kathleen stood nearby, offering understanding: ""Elizabeth, how could you say such hurtful things? I never meant to compete with you. I'd be content just staying by Gary and the child.""

Gary movedly grasped Kathleen's hand. ""You've always been thoughtful.""

Then he looked me up and down, sneering: ""Every single luxury item on you—which one wasn't bought with my money? And you talk about remarrying?""

""Who else could give you this lavish lifestyle?""

""Elizabeth, the Perez group isn't what it used to be. If you want to keep living like this, you'd better treat Kathleen with respect!""

""From now on, Kathleen will move in to bond with the child.""

""Since you can't raise them properly, let their real mother do it!""

A glint of triumph flashed in Kathleen's eyes as she looked at me. I couldn't be bothered with them and looked down at the message from Dylan Baker: ""Sweetheart, I've got one more business deal to wrap up in Europe. Thanks for taking care of the kids these days. I'll make it up to you when I get back!""

Then, eighty million dollars was deposited into my bank account.

""Take yourself out for afternoon tea, my love.""

After that, he sent a 'praise me' emoji.

The frustration in my chest instantly melted away. I typed with a smile: ""Focus on your work. I'll be waiting for you.""

But then, as soon as I looked up, I saw Kathleen feeding chocolate to the child.

""Come on, son, try this chocolate Mommy brought back from abroad. Tell me if it's good.""

I dashed over and knocked the chocolate out of her hand, my face flushed with anger. ""He can't eat chocolate.""

Suddenly, Kathleen threw herself backward and screamed, ""Ah! Gary, help me!""

Gary pushed me away to help Kathleen.

I lost my balance and fell to the ground.

The curses around grew louder, ""How can there be such a wicked nanny who won’t even let the birth mother hold her child!""

""She’s clearly rotten to the core! Can’t you see she’s dressed more lavishly than the mistress? Probably embezzled loads from her employer over the years!""

Chapter 3

""...""

A bratty kid actually poured coffee on me, ""Beat the bad lady!""

My phone got knocked away during the scuffle, and that brat picked it up to smash it playfully.

My expression darkened. I’d rushed back this time without bodyguards, never expecting this chaos.

I said firmly to the crowd, ""I’m not the nanny. This is my child with my current husband.""

But the accusations kept drowning out my explanations.

I struggled to stand up, trying to leave with my child first.

Unexpectedly, someone pinned me to the ground.

Gary's leather shoes appeared before me as he looked down condescendingly. ""Apologize to Kathleen.""

I fought violently, only to be slapped by Gary. ""Elizabeth, Kathleen is carrying my child. She's the hero of our Perez family.""

""Keeping you as Mrs. Perez is already giving you enough respect. If you dare bully Kathleen using your position as my wife, everything you have can be taken away anytime.""

For some reason, my mind flashed back to that night three years ago—when I'd eagerly waited for Gary's return, only to learn about his child with Kathleen.

Gary had promised me before leaving home that what happened with Kathleen was just a slip-up. He'd cut ties with her and come back to our family.

My heart was already shattered, but I gave him another chance only because his mother once saved my life.

Yet I never imagined Gary would abandon our infant to me—treating me like a nanny—just to accompany Kathleen abroad for her studies.

The thought fueled my rage, and I struggled fiercely against his grip.

Then Kathleen hypocritically helped me up. ""Gary, let Elizabeth go. I don't blame her.""

She smugly rubbed her belly. ""After all, I've been hired by the Baker group. When things get busy, I'll still need big sister's help at home.""

My eyes darkened. ""Which Baker group?""

Seeing me ask this, Kathleen grew even more smug. ""Elizabeth, have you seriously lost your edge after all these years raising kids? Look around San Francisco—is there any other Baker group?""

""My direct boss is Dylan, the wealthiest man in New York.""

""Later, I'll just coax my boss a little, and he'll hand over billion-dollar contracts to the Perezes. Gary's company will definitely thrive.""

Gary held Kathleen in a doting embrace and kissed her. ""Kathleen's our little hero!""

He then looked at me scornfully. ""Hear that? Demand an apology from Kathleen now?""

I curled my lips and stated flat-out, ""She'll never get into the Baker group.""

Back then, Dylan nearly blew these scumbags away. If I hadn't felt indebted to the Perezes and stopped him desperately, the Perez group would've been crushed by Dylan ages ago.

Still your boss?

How could Dylan allow someone who hurt me into the Baker group?

Their faces paled. Kathleen protested indignantly, ""How dare you say that?""

I cast a cool glance at them. ""Because I'm Dylan's wife.""

Before I finished, Gary ordered bodyguards to drag me out of the airport and shove me into a car. ""You're my woman. Who said you could fantasize about another man?""

""Seems I've been too lenient with you!""

I was hauled back to the Perez manor and forced to kneel before the cemetery.

Gary pulled out a thorned whip and savagely struck me.

""Years ago, my mother saved you. She pitied your suffering and made me marry you into the Perez family.""

""Have I ever mistreated you? I only got involved with Kathleen to continue the Perez bloodline. Yet you dare defy wifely duties, claiming to be another man's wife?""

Chapter 4

""Do you even see me as your husband!""

My eyes reddened. He'd pursued me relentlessly for three years before I accepted him. I poured my entire inheritance into the Perez group.

I never forgot the family's kindness—after marriage, I devoted myself to homemaking, becoming his steadfast support.

Even knowing I struggled with fertility, he vowed to have only me for life.

Yet he broke that oath. Now he forced divorce to marry Kathleen, just to get a spouse visa for her studies abroad!

The wounds on my back burned, but I stared defiantly at Gary. ""We're already divorced.""

Gary froze, confusion flickering in his eyes before his expression softened. ""Just a paper divorce. We'll remarry after the wedding ceremony.""

Kathleen's face twisted with resentment beside them. She suddenly scooped up the child, voice dripping with false sorrow, ""Gary, perhaps I shouldn't live with you anymore. I wouldn't want to affect your marriage with Elizabeth.""

Seeing me being bullied, the child bit hard into Kathleen's arm.

Kathleen screamed in pain and actually flung the child away.

I dashed desperately but couldn't reach in time. The child hit the ground, sobbing in pain.

I gathered the child into my arms, guilt pouring down my cheeks in heavy tears. ""Baby, where does it hurt? Tell Mommy.""

Gary carefully examined Kathleen's hand before grabbing the child by the collar in fury. ""What have you taught this child? How dare he bite! As his father, I'll discipline him properly today!""

""Someone! Tie him to the pillar outside! He stays there until he learns who his real mother is!""

My pupils froze. ""Gary, you can't do this to my child!""

""It's snowing outside, they'll freeze!""

Gary dragged me into the cubicle and ripped open my clothes.

Rage filled his eyes. ""I haven't been exercising my husbandly rights enough, letting you run wild!""

He immediately started gnawing at my chest.

I slapped him across the face, eyes red. ""Gary, you'll regret this!""

Gary wiped his mouth and bellowed, ""Regret?""

""Once Kathleen joins the Baker group and I partner with Dylan, the Perez group will rise to the next tier overnight. Serve me properly now, or you'll be the one regretting it!""

I gritted my teeth. ""That's Dylan's child! Treat us like this, and he'll destroy you!""

Gary tore my pants apart in a rage, like a mad wolf, ""You're truly insane, still spouting nonsense! If I don't discipline you properly, you'll dare openly harm Kathleen next!""

He was about to strike when a scream and child's wail echoed outside.

Gary immediately zipped up and rushed out to investigate.

""Gary, I just wanted the child to call me mom. He kicked my belly, so I accidentally hit him once.""

I charged over hysterically, saw the child's swollen red cheek, and swung a brick at Kathleen's head, ""Touch my child? I'll end you!""

Gary instantly kicked my stomach and frantically held Kathleen, ""Kathleen, are you hurt?""

Kathleen clutched her stomach, whispering weakly: ""Gary, I'm in so much pain. Are the baby and I going to die?""

""Maybe death would be better. Then I wouldn't have to hide while following you anymore. Gary, promise you'll care for my child after I'm gone... even if they never accept me as their real mother...""

Chapter 5

Gary went wild, holding Kathleen tightly. ""I won't let anything happen to you! The private doctor's coming!""

He then turned and looked at me like I was already dead, his voice cruel. ""You dared teach our child to hurt Kathleen.""

His eyes swept over our child wailing nonstop while tied to the pillar. My heart plummeted.

His voice was icy cold. ""Bring the whip soaked in salt water!""

I rushed over in panic and grabbed Gary's arm. ""Gary! Don't do this to my child! Whatever you want, do it to me!""

With just one look from him, bodyguards pinned me down.

""Crack—""

The child's screams nearly shattered my eardrums. Breaking free from the bodyguards, I clung to Gary's leg and begged: ""No! Don't hit him! I'm sorry, it's all my fault! Please don't hit him!""

Gary kicked me away and struck again with the whip. He pressed the child's head coldly: ""Say it. Who's your real mother?""

The child convulsed in pain, yet still turned tear-filled eyes to me and whimpered ""Mom"" in utter misery.

My heart shattered into countless pieces as I knelt before Gary, banging my head against the ground.

""Please, spare the child! I'll do anything you ask!""

Gary pointed at Kathleen playing dead beside him. ""You disfigured Kathleen. Should I teach you how to make this right?""

Immediately I grabbed a brick and slammed it against my own head—once, twice, again and again.

Time blurred until blood covered my eyes, darkness flickering across my vision. As I fainted, Gary's coaxing voice reached Kathleen: ""Kathleen, feeling better now?""

""Not yet. Let's feed him to the wolves in the back mountains, yeah?""

Waking in the chill, I heard the child whimpering beside me, breaths growing shallower.

And wolves surrounded us all around!

I held the child and ran desperately, but was still surrounded by the wolves.

Just as the wolves lunged at us, I pressed the child tightly against my chest and closed my eyes in despair...

And at that moment, the roar of countless helicopters filled the sky above the Perez manor.

A week later, Kathleen in a fitted business suit stood before Gary, twirling around, ""Gary, how do I look in this outfit?""

""For a company like the Baker group, should I dress more elegantly?""

But Gary was somewhat distracted; somehow, the image of Elizabeth's red eyes when she was thrown into the mountains always flashed through his mind.

Every time he thought about it, his heart ached uncontrollably.

In fact, he had missed Elizabeth terribly these past three years.

He hadn't returned for three years because of Kathleen, so Elizabeth was naturally upset. He really shouldn't have treated her like that right after coming back.

Gary immediately decided to cancel the punishment. Even though he'd sent people to protect the mother and child, there were wolves in the back mountains—too dangerous.

When Elizabeth returned, he'd remarry her immediately and hold a proper wedding.

That way, Elizabeth probably wouldn't sulk at him anymore, he thought.

Yet Kathleen kept chattering beside him. Gary frowned impatiently, ""He's your own son! Aren't you worried at all? Still fussing over what to wear?""

Kathleen froze, about to explain, when the assistant rushed in. ""President, Madam sent a child to Africa for adoption three years ago...""

The door was suddenly kicked open, and a crowd flooded in.

The leader had snake-like eyes but wore a smirk, staring at Gary as if looking at a corpse. Gary’s eyes widened instantly.

I’m struggling. It’s actually quite lonely. I didn’t think it was going to be an issue because I used to love remote work during covid , but my husband now travels three days a week, usually during the work week.

I go to the gym. I have a lot of camera on meetings. I try to get out of the house after work, but sometimes you just don’t feel like it.

I miss dressing up, having side chats, grabbing a coffee from the lobby, being around people. How do you deal with it?",0,1755023317.0,remotework,16,0.2,False

In ali’s latest vlog, he said he doesn’t post about Palestine or Gaza because he doesn’t need “validation” and that it’s “hypocritical” to post about it. people called him out and he dropped a lazy, half-hearted clarification in the comments.

but the bigger issue is that both of them, especially anya, are a walking ad for overconsumption. she keeps buying from brands that are on boycott lists with zero remorse, zero guilt, and zero thought. everyone knows it’s new money and she’s buying everything she couldn’t before, but it’s painfully tone deaf. they block anyone who calls them out.

and for the “boycotts don’t work” crowd, they do. puma cut ties with israel’s national football team after sustained public backlash and boycotts. collective action works but only if people with influence stop hiding behind excuses and actually take a stand.

in one vlog, ali showed how almost all her coffee syrups and products had expired. without thinking twice, she told him to throw them away. when she first set up her coffee table, she bought every coffee flavour and product she could find without keeping the utility in mind, she then bought dozen of glass bottles and poured the syrups in them so they look better, only for them to end up in the trash.

this isn’t about policing someone’s spending. the point is, when you have a massive audience, your habits influence people. wasting edible products in a world where millions go hungry isn’t just careless, it’s disgusting.

the worst part is how many girls openly say they want to be like her. her entire online persona is just buying, shopping, and handing out expensive gifts. this endless cycle of wanting something, buying it, and moving on normalises mindless consumption.

i’m beyond disappointed, especially for the young girls who look up to them. instead of promoting conscious choices and ethical consumption, anya and ali are glamorising waste and supporting complicit brands.

  { Katy }  
  
  Back in the day, I had this plan for the off chance that I was around for the whole end-of-the-world thing. It involved climbing up on my roof and blasting R.E.M.’s “It’s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)” as loud as humanly possible, but real life rarely turns out that cool.  
  
  It was happening—everything about the world as we knew it was ending, and it sure as hell did not feel fine. Or cool.  
  
  Opening my eyes, I inched aside the flimsy white curtain. I peered out, beyond the porch and the cleared yard, into the thick woods surrounding the cabin Luc had stashed in the forests of Coeur d’Alene, a city in Idaho I couldn’t even begin to pronounce or spell.  
  
  The yard was empty. There was no flickering, brilliant white light shining through the trees. No one was out there. Correction. Nothing was out there. No birds were chirping or fluttering from leafy branch to branch. Not one sign of any woodland creatures scurrying anywhere. There wasn’t even the low hum of insects. Everything was silent and still, soundless in a totally creeptastic kind of way.  
  
  My gaze fixed on the woods, glued to the last place I’d seen Daemon. A deep, throbbing ache lit up my chest. The night we’d fallen asleep on the couch seemed like ages ago, but it had only been forty-eight hours or so since I’d woken up, overheated, and nearly been blinded by Daemon’s true form. He hadn’t been able to control it, although if we’d known what it signaled, it probably wouldn’t have changed anything.  
  
  So many others of his kind, hundreds—if not thousands—of Luxen, had come to Earth, and Daemon . . . he was gone, along with his sister and brother, and we were still here in this cabin.  
  
  Pressure clamped down on my chest, as if someone were squeezing my heart and lungs with vise grips. Every so often, Sergeant Dasher’s warning came back to haunt me. I’d seriously thought the man—that all of Daedalus—was riding the crazy train into Insanity Land, but they had been right.  
  
  God, they had been so right.  
  
  The Luxen came like Daedalus had warned, like they had prepared for, and Daemon . . . The ache pulsed, ripping the air right from my lungs, and I squeezed my eyes shut. I had no idea why he left with them or why I hadn’t seen or heard from him or his family. The terror and confusion surrounding his disappearance were a constant shadow that haunted every waking moment and even the few minutes I’d been able to sleep.  
  
  What side would Daemon be standing on? Dasher had asked that of me once, while I’d been held at the very real Area 51, and I couldn’t let myself believe that I had that answer now.  
  
  In the last two days, more Luxen had fallen from the sky. They’d kept coming and coming like an endless stream of falling stars, and then there was—  
  
  “Nothing.”  
  
  My eyes popped open, and the curtain slipped from my fingers, softly falling back into place. “Get out of my head.”  
  
  “I can’t help it,” Archer replied from where he sat on the couch. “You’re broadcasting your thoughts so damn loudly I feel like I need to go sit in the corner and start rocking, whispering Daemon’s name over and over again.”  
  
  Irritation pricked at my skin, and no matter how much I tried to keep my thoughts, my worries and fears, to myself, it was useless when there was not one, but two Origins in the house. Their nifty little ability to read thoughts got real annoying real fast.  
  
  I picked at the curtain again, watching the woods. “Still no sign of any Luxen?”  
  
  “Nope. Not a single glowing light crashing to Earth in the last five hours.” Archer sounded as tired as I felt. He hadn’t been sleeping much, either. While I’d been fixated on keeping an eye on the outside, he’d been focused on the TV. News all across the globe had been reporting nonstop on the “phenomenon.”  
  
  “Some of the news stations are trying to say it was a massive meteorite shower.”  
  
  I snorted.  
  
  “Trying to cover up anything at this point is useless.” Archer sighed wearily, and he was right.  
  
  What happened in Las Vegas—what we had done—had been videotaped and blasted all over the internet within hours. At some point during the day after the absolute obliteration of Las Vegas, all the videos had been pulled down, but the damage had already been done. From what the news copter had captured before Daedalus had shot it down, to those on the scene who recorded everything with their camera phones, there was no stopping the truth. The internet was a funny place, though. While some people were blogging that it was the end of times, others took a more creative approach to everything. Apparently, there was even a meme created already.  
  
  The incredibly photogenic glowing-alien meme.  
  
  Which had been Daemon phasing into his true form. His human features were blurred to unrecognizability, but I knew it had been him. If he’d been around to see that, he would’ve really gotten a kick out of it, but I didn’t—  
  
  “Stop,” Archer said gently. “We don’t know what the hell Daemon, or any of them, are doing or why at this point. They will come back.”  
  
  I turned from the window, finally facing Archer. His hair, a sandy brown color, was cut close to the scalp, typical military style. He was tall and broad-shouldered, someone who looked like he could throw down when it counted, and I knew he could.  
  
  Archer could be downright deadly.  
  
  When I’d first met him at Area 51, I had believed he was just a solider. It wasn’t until Daemon had arrived that we discovered he was Luc’s implant within Daedalus and also, like Luc, an Origin, a child of a Luxen male and mutated, hybrid female.  
  
  My fingers curled inward. “You really believe that? They will come back?”  
  
  Amethyst eyes flicked from the TV to mine. “It’s all I can believe at this point. It’s all any of us can believe right now.”  
  
  That wasn’t really reassuring.  
  
  “Sorry,” he replied, letting it be known he’d picked up on my thoughts yet again. He nodded at the TV before I could get ticked off. “Something’s going on. Why would that many Luxen come to Earth and then just go silent?”  
  
  That was also the question of the year.  
  
  “I think it’s kind of obvious,” said a voice from the hall. I turned as Luc entered the living room. Tall and slender, he had his brown-colored hair pulled back in a ponytail at the nape of his neck. Luc was younger than us, around fourteen or fifteen, but he was like a little teen mafia leader and, at times, scarier than Archer. “And you know exactly what I’m talking about,” he added, eyeing the older Origin.  
  
  As Archer and Luc locked eyes in a battle of the stare-down, something they’d been doing a lot of during the last two days, I sat on the arm of a chair by the window. “Care to explain out loud?”  
  
  Luc had a certain boyish quality to his beautiful face, like he hadn’t quite lost the roundness of childhood yet, but there was a wisdom in his purple eyes that went beyond a handful of years.  
  
  He leaned against the doorframe, crossing his arms. “They’re planning. Strategizing. Waiting.”  
  
  That didn’t sound good, but I wasn’t surprised. An ache formed between my temples. Archer said nothing as he went back to staring at the TV.  
  
  “Why else would they come here?” Luc continued as he tilted his head, gazing at the curtained window near me. “I’m sure it’s not to shake hands and kiss babies’ cheeks. They’re here for a reason, and it’s not good.”  
  
  “Daedalus always believed they would invade.” Archer sat back, clasping his hands over his knees. “The whole Origin initiative was in response to that concern. After all, the Luxen don’t have a history of playing nice  
with other intelligent life-forms. But why now?”  
  
  Wincing, I rubbed my temples. I hadn’t believed Dr. Roth when he’d told me how the Luxen were actually the cause of the war between them and the Arum—a war that had destroyed both of their planets. And I’d thought Sergeant Dasher and Nancy Husher, the head bitch in charge of Daedalus, were crazy freaks.  
  
  I’d been wrong.  
  
  So had Daemon.  
  
  Luc arched a brow as he coughed out a laugh. “Oh, I don’t know, might have to do with the very public spectacle we put on in Vegas. We know there were implants here, Luxen who aren’t that fond of humans. How they communicated with the Luxen not on this planet is beyond me, but is that really important now? This was the perfect moment to make an entrance.”  
  
  My eyes narrowed. “You said it was a brilliant idea.”  
  
  “I think lots of things are brilliant ideas. Like nuclear weapons, zero-calorie soft drinks, and blue jean vests,” he replied. “That doesn’t mean we should nuke people, or that diet drinks taste good, or that you should run out to the local Walmart and buy a jean vest. You people shouldn’t always listen to me.”  
  
  My eyes rolled so hard they almost fell out of the back of my head. “Well, what else were we supposed to do? If Daemon and the others hadn’t exposed themselves, we would’ve been captured.”  
  
  Neither of the guys replied, but the unspoken words hung between us. If we’d been captured, it would’ve sucked donkey butt and then some, but Paris, Ash, and Andrew would probably still be alive. So would the innocent humans who had lost their lives when everything went to crap.  
  
  But there was nothing we could do about that now. Time could be frozen for short periods, but no one could go back and change things. What was done was done, and Daemon had made that decision to protect all of us. I’d be damned if anyone threw him under the spaceship.  
  
  “You look exhausted,” commented Archer, and it took a moment for me to realize he was talking to me.  
  
  Luc turned those unnerving eyes on me. “Actually, you look like crap.”  
  
  Gee. Thanks.  
  
  Archer ignored him. “I think you should try to sleep. Just for a little while. If anything happens, we will get you.”  
  
  “No.” I shook my head just in case my verbal cue wasn’t enough. “I’m fine.” The truth was I was far from being fine. I was probably one step away from going to that dark corner in the room and rocking back and forth, but I couldn’t break down, and I couldn’t sleep. Not when Daemon was out there somewhere, and not when the whole world was on the verge of . . . hell, turning into a dystopia, like one of those novels I used to read.  
  
  Sigh. Books. I missed them.  
  
  Archer frowned, and it turned his handsome face a little scary, but before he could lay into me, Luc pushed off of the doorway and spoke. “I think she needs to go talk to Beth, actually.”  
  
  Surprised, I glanced at the stairwell in the hall outside the room. The last I checked, the girl had been sleeping. That was all Beth seemed to do. I was almost envious of her ability to sleep all of this away.  
  
  “Why?” I asked. “Is she awake?”  
  
  Luc ambled into the living room. “I think you two need some girl-talk time.”  
  
  My shoulders slumped as I sighed. “Luc, I really don’t think this is the time for girl bonding.”  
  
  “It isn’t?” He dropped onto the couch beside Archer and kicked his feet up on the coffee table. “What else are you doing besides staring out the window and trying to sneak past us so you can go off into the woods, look for Daemon, and probably get eaten by a mountain lion?”  
  
  Anger punched through me as I flipped my long ponytail over my shoulder. “First off, I wouldn’t get eaten by a mountain lion. Second, at least I’d be trying to do something other than sitting on my ass.”  
  
  Archer sighed.  
  
  But Luc just smiled brightly up at me. “Are we going to have this argument again?” He glanced at a stone-faced Archer. “Because I like it when you two get into it. It’s like watching a mom and dad have a marital disagreement. I feel like I need to go hide in a bedroom or something to make it more authentic. Maybe slam a door shut or—”  
  
  “Shut up, Luc,” Archer growled, and then he turned his glare on me. “We’ve been down this road more times than I care to even think about. Going after them isn’t smart. There will be too many of them, and we don’t know if—”  
  
  “Daemon is not one of them!” I shouted, jumping to my feet and breathing heavily. “He hasn’t joined them. Neither would Dee or Dawson. I don’t know what’s going on.” My voice cracked, and a swell of emotion rose in my throat. “But they wouldn’t do that. He wouldn’t.”  
  
  Archer leaned forward, eyes glittering. “You don’t know that. We don’t.”  
  
  “You just said they’d be back!” I fired at him.  
  
  He didn’t say anything as he cast his gaze back to the TV, and that told me what I already knew deep down. Archer didn’t expect Daemon or any of them to come back.  
  
  Clamping my lips together, I shook my head so fast my ponytail turned into a whip. I turned away, stalking toward the doorway before we did get knee-deep in this argument again.  
  
  “Where are you going?” asked Archer.  
  
  I resisted the urge to flip him off. “I’m going to have girl talk with Beth, apparently.”  
  
  “Sounds like a plan,” commented Luc.  
  
  Ignoring him, I rounded the stairs and all but stomped up them. I hated sitting around and doing nothing. I hated that every time I opened that front door, Luc or Archer was there to stop me. And what I hated most of all was the fact that they could stop me.  
  
  I might be a hybrid, mutated with all that special Luxen goodness, but they were Origins, and they could kick my butt from here to California if it came down to it.  
  
  The upstairs was quiet and dark, and I didn’t like being here. Wasn’t sure why, but the tiny hairs on the back of my neck rose every time I came up here and walked down the long, narrow hall.  
  
  Beth and Dawson had commandeered the last bedroom on the right the first night here, and that’s where Beth had holed herself up since he . . . since he left. I didn’t know the girl well, but I knew she’d been through a lot when she was under the control of Daedalus, and I also didn’t believe that she was the most stable of all hybrids out there, but that wasn’t her fault. And I hated to admit this, but sometimes, she kind of freaked me out.  
  
  Stopping in front of the door, I rapped my knuckles on it instead of busting up into the room.  
  
  “Yes?” came the thin and reedy voice.  
  
  I winced as I pushed open the door. Beth sounded terrible, and when I got an eyeful of her, she looked just as bad. Sitting up against the headboard with a mountain of blankets piled around her, she had dark circles under her eyes. Her pale, waiflike features were sharp, and her hair was an unwashed, tangled mess. I tried not to breathe too deeply, because the room smelled of vomit and sweat.  
  
  I halted at the bed, shocked to my core. “Are you sick?”  
  
  Her unfocused gaze drifted away from me, landing on the door to the adjoined bathroom. It didn’t make sense. Hybrids—we couldn’t get sick. Not the common cold or the most dangerous cancer. Like the Luxen, we were immune to everything out there in terms of disease, but Beth? Yeah, she wasn’t looking too good.  
  
  A great sense of unease blossomed in my belly, stiffening my muscles. “Beth?”  
  
  Her watery stare finally drifted back to me. “Is Dawson back yet?”  
  
  My heart turned over heavily, almost painfully. The two of them had been through so much, more than Daemon and I had, and this . . . God, this wasn’t fair. “No, he’s not back yet, but you? You look sick.”  
  
  She raised a slim, pale hand to her throat as she swallowed. “I’m not feeling very well.”  
  
  I didn’t know what level of bad this was, and I was almost afraid to find out. “What’s wrong?”  
  
  One shoulder rose, and it looked like it had taken great effort. “You shouldn’t be worried,” she said, voice low as she picked at the hem of a blanket. “It’s  
not a big deal. I’ll be okay once Dawson comes back.” Her gaze floated off again, and as she dropped the edge of the blanket, she reached down, put her hand over her blanket-covered belly, and said, “We’ll be okay once Dawson comes back.”  
  
  “We’ll be . . . ?” I trailed off as my eyes widened. My jaw came unhinged and dropped as I gaped at her.  
  
  I stared at where her hand was and watched in dawning horror as she rubbed her belly in slow, steady circles.  
  
  Oh no. Oh, hell to the no to the tenth power.  
  
  I started forward and then stopped. “Beth, are you . . . are you pregnant?”  
  
  She tipped her head back against the wall and squeezed her eyes shut. “We should’ve been more careful.”  
  
  My legs suddenly felt weak. The sleeping. The exhaustion. All of it made sense. Beth was pregnant, but at first, like a total idiot, I didn’t understand how. Then common sense took over, and I wanted to scream, Where were the condoms? But that was kind of a moot point.  
  An image appeared in my head of Micah, the little boy who’d helped us escape Daedalus. Micah, the little kid who had snapped necks and destroyed brains with a mere thought.  
  
  Holy alien babies, she was carrying one of them? One of those creepy children—creepy, dangerous, and extremely deadly? Granted, Archer and Luc had probably been one of those creepy kids at one time, but nothing about that thought was reassuring, because the newest batch of Origins that Daedalus had whipped up were different than the ones Luc and Archer had popped out of.  
  
  And Luc and Archer were still kind of creepy.  
  
  “You’re staring at me like you’re upset,” she said softly.  
  
  I forced a smile onto my face, knowing it probably looked a little crazy. “No. I’m just surprised.”  
  
  A faint smile appeared on her lips. “Yeah, we were, too. This is really bad timing, isn’t it?”  
  
  Ha. Understatement of the lifetime.  
  
  As I watched her, the smile slowly slipped off her lips. I had no idea what to say to her. Congratulations? That didn’t seem appropriate for some reason, but it also seemed wrong not to say it. Did they even know about the Origins, about all those kids Daedalus had?  
  
  And would this baby be like Micah?  
  
  God, really? Did we not have enough to worry about right now? My chest tightened, and I thought I might be having a panic attack. “How . . . how far along are you?”  
  
  “Three months,” she said, swallowing hard.  
  
  I needed to sit down.  
  
  Hell, I needed an adult.  
  
  Visions of dirty diapers and angry, red little faces danced in my head. Would there be one baby or would there be three? That was something we never thought about when it came to the Origins, but the Luxen always popped out in threes.  
  
  Oh, holy llama drama, three babies?  
  
  Beth’s gaze met mine again, and something in those eyes caused me to shudder. She leaned forward, her hand stilling over her belly. “They’re not coming back the same, are they?”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Them,” she said. “Dawson and Daemon and Dee. They’re not going to come back the same, are they?”  
  
  About thirty minutes later, I walked downstairs in a daze. The guys were where I’d left them, sitting on the couch, watching the news. When I entered the room, Luc glanced at me, and Archer looked like someone had shoved a pole up some very uncomfortable place.  
  
  And I knew.  
  
  “Both of you knew about Beth?” I wanted to hit them when they stared blankly back at me. “And no one thought to tell me?”  
  
  Archer shrugged. “We were hoping it wouldn’t become an issue.”  
  
  “Oh my God.” Not become an issue? Like being pregnant with an alien hybrid baby wasn’t a big deal and would just, I don’t know, go away? I dropped into the chair, placing my face in my hands. What next? Seriously. “She’s going to have a baby.”  
  
  “That’s usually what happens when you have unprotected sex,” Luc commented. “Glad you two talked, though, because I so did not want to be the bearer of that news.”  
  
  “She’s going to have one of those creepy kids,” I went on, smoothing the tips of my fingers over my forehead. “She’s going to have a baby and Dawson is not even here and the whole world is going to fall apart.”  
  
  “She’s only three months along.” Archer cleared his throat. “Let’s not panic.”  
  
  “Panic?” I whispered. The headache was getting worse. “There are things she needs, like, I don’t know, a doctor to make sure the pregnancy is going all right. She needs prenatal vitamins and food and probably saltine crackers and pickles and—”  
  
  “And we can get those things for her,” Archer replied, and I lifted my head. “Everything except the doctor. If someone draws her blood, well, that would be problematic, especially given what’s going on.”  
  
  I stared at him. “Wait. My mom—”  
  
  “No.” Luc’s head whipped toward me. “You cannot contact your mom.”  
  
  My spine stiffened. “She could help us. At least give us the general idea of how to take care of Beth.” Once the idea popped into my head, I latched onto it. I was totally honest with myself. Some of the reason why it seemed like such a great idea was because I wanted to talk to her. I needed to talk to her.  
  
  “We already know what Beth needs, and unless your mom has the low down on how to care for pregnant hybrids, there’s not much more she can tell us that Google won’t.” Luc pulled his feet off the coffee table and they thumped on the floor. “And it will be dangerous to get in contact with your mom. Her phone could be monitored. It’s too dangerous for us and her.”  
  
  “Do you really think Daedalus gives two craps about us right now?”  
  
  “Is that something you want to risk?” Archer asked, meeting my gaze. “You willing to put all of us in danger, including Beth, all based on a hope they have their hands full? You willing to do that to your mom?”  
  
  My mouth screwed shut as I glared at him, but the fight leaked out of me like a balloon deflating. No. No, I wouldn’t risk that. I wouldn’t do that to us or to my mom. Tears pricked my eyes and I forced a deep breath.  
  
  “I’m working on something that will hopefully take care of the Nancy problem,” Luc announced, but the only thing I’d seen him work on was the fine art of sitting on his butt.  
  
  “Okay,” I said, voice hoarse as I willed the headache to go away and for the edges of bitter panic to recede. I had to keep it together, but that dark corner was looking better and better. “We need to get stuff for Beth.”  
  
  Archer nodded. “We do.”  
  
  Less than an hour later, Luc handed over a list of items he’d searched down on the internet. The whole situation made me feel like I was in some kind of twisted after-school special.  
  
  I wanted to laugh as I folded the piece of paper into the back pocket of my jeans, but then I probably wouldn’t stop laughing.  
  
  Luc was staying behind with Beth in case . . . well, in case something even worse happened, and I was going to go with Archer. Mainly because I thought it would be a good idea to get out of the cabin. At least it felt like I was doing something, and maybe—maybe going into town would give us some clues to where Daemon and his family had disappeared.  
  
  My hair was tucked up under a baseball cap that hid most of my face, so the chances I’d be recognized were slim. I had no idea if anyone would, but I didn’t want to take that risk.  
  
  It was late afternoon, and the air outside carried a chill that made me grateful I was wearing one of Daemon’s bulky long-sleeve shirts. Even in the heavily pine-scented air, if I breathed in deeply, I could catch his unique scent, a mix of spice and the outdoors.  
  
  My lower lip trembled as I climbed into the passenger seat and buckled myself in with shaky hands. Archer passed me a quick glance, and I forced myself to stop thinking about Daemon, about anything I didn’t want to share with Archer, which was pretty much everything right now.  
  
  So I thought about belly dancing foxes wearing grass skirts.  
  
  Archer snorted. “You’re weird.”  
  
  “And you’re rude.” I leaned forward, peering out the window as we traveled down the driveway, straining to see among the trees, but there was nothing.  
  
  “I told you before. It’s hard to not do it sometimes.” He stopped at the end of the gravel road, checking both ways before he pulled out. “Trust me. There are times when I wish I couldn’t see into people’s heads.”  
  
  “I imagine being stuck with me the last two days has been one of them.”  
  
  “Honestly? You haven’t been bad.” He glanced at me when I raised my brows. “You’ve been holding it together.”  
  
  I didn’t know how to respond to that at first, because since the other Luxen had arrived, I felt like I was seconds from shattering apart. And I wasn’t sure what exactly was keeping me together. A year ago, I would’ve freaked out and that corner would’ve been my best friend, but I wasn’t the same girl who had knocked on Daemon’s door.  
  
  I would probably never be that girl again.  
  
  I’d been throug  
h a lot, especially when I’d been in the hands of Daedalus. Things I’d experienced that I couldn’t dwell on, but the time with Daemon, and those months with Daedalus, had made me stronger. Or at least I liked to think they had.  
  
  “I have to keep it together,” I said finally, folding my arms around me as I stared at the rapidly passing pines. The needled branches all blurred together. “Because I know Daemon didn’t lose it when I . . . when I was gone. So I can’t, either.”  
  
  “But—”  
  
  “Do you worry about Dee?” I cut him off, turning my attention fully on him.  
  
  A muscle thrummed along his jaw, but he didn’t respond, and as we made the quiet trip into the largest city in Idaho, I couldn’t help but think this wasn’t what I really needed to be doing. That instead, I needed to do what Daemon had done for me.  
  
  He had come for me when I’d been taken.  
  
  “That was different,” Archer said, cutting into my thoughts as he turned toward the closest supermarket. “He knew what he was getting into. You don’t.”  
  
  “Did he?” I asked as he found a parking space close to the entrance. “He might have had an idea, but I don’t think he really knew, and he still did it. He was brave.”  
  
  Archer cast me a long look as he pulled out the keys. “And you are brave, but you are not stupid. At least I’m hoping you continue to prove you’re not stupid.” He opened the door. “Stay close to me.”  
  
  I made a face at him but climbed out. The parking lot was pretty packed, and I wondered if everyone was stocking up for the coming apocalypse. On the news, there’d been rioting in a lot of the major cities after the “meteorites” fell. Local police and military had locked it down, but there was a TV show called Doomsday Preppers for a reason. For the most part, Coeur d’Alene appeared virtually untouched by what was happening, even though so many Luxen had landed in the nearby forests.  
  
  There were a lot of people in the store, their carts stacked high with canned goods and bottled water. I tried to keep my gaze down as I pulled out the list and Archer grabbed a basket, though I couldn’t help but notice no one was grabbing toilet paper.  
  
  That would be the first thing I grabbed if I thought it was the end of the world.  
  
  I stuck close to Archer’s side as we headed to the pharmacy section and started scanning the endless rows of brown bottles with yellow caps.  
  
  Sighing, I glanced down at the list. “Couldn’t this crap be in alphabetical order?”  
  
  “That would be too easy.” His arm blocked my vision as he picked up a bottle. “Iron on the list, right?”  
  
  “Yep.” My fingers hovered over folic acid and I picked it up, having no idea what the hell that even was or what it did.  
  
  Archer knelt down. “And the answer is yes to your earlier question.”  
  
  “Huh?”  
  
  He looked up through his lashes. “You asked if I was worried about Dee. I am.”  
  
  My fingers tightened over the bottle as my breath caught. “You like her, don’t you?”  
  
  “Yes.” He turned his attention to the oversize bottles of prenatal vitamins. “In spite of the fact that her brother is Daemon.”  
  
  As I stared down at him, my lips twitched into the first smile since the Luxen had—  
  
  The boom, like a sonic clap of thunder, came out of nowhere, shaking the rack of pills and startling me into taking a step back.  
  
  Archer stood fluidly, his shrewd gaze swinging around the crowded market. People stopped in the middle of the aisles, some hands tightening on their carts, others letting go, the wheels creaking as the carts slowly rolled away.  
  
  “What was that?” a woman asked a man who stood next to her. She turned, picking up a little girl who had to be no more than three. Holding the child close to her breast, she spun around, her face pale. “What was that—?”  
  
  The clap of sound roared through the store again. Someone screamed. Bottles fell from the racks. Footsteps pounded across the linoleum floor. My heart jumped as I twisted toward the front of the store. Something flashed in the parking lot, like lightning striking the ground.  
  
  “Dammit,” Archer growled.  
  
  The tiny hairs on my arms rose as I walked toward the end of the aisle, forgetting all pretenses of keeping my head down.  
  
  A heartbeat of silence passed, and thunder blasted again and again, rattling the bones in my body as streaks of light lit up the parking lot, one after another after another. The glass window in front cracked, and the screams . . . the screams got louder, snapping with terror as the windows shattered, flinging glass at the checkout lanes.  
  
  The streaks of blinding light formed shapes in the parking lot, stretching and taking on legs and arms. Their tall, lithe bodies tinged in red, like Daemon’s, but deeper, more crimson.  
  
  “Oh God,” I whispered, the bottle of pills slipping from my fingers, smacking off the floor.  
  
  They were everywhere, dozens of them. Luxen.  
  
  2  
  
  { Katy }  
  
  Everyone, including me, seemed to be frozen for a moment, as if time had been stopped, but I knew that hadn’t happened.  
  
  The forms in the parking lot turned, their necks stretching and tilting to the side, their steps fluid and snakelike. Their movements were unnatural and nothing like the Luxen who had been on Earth for years.  
  
  A red truck squealed its tires as it spun out of a parking space, spilling smoke and the smell of burned rubber into the air. It whirled around, as if the driver planned to plow through the Luxen.  
  
  “Oh no,” I whispered, my heart thumping heavily.  
  
  Archer grabbed my hand. “We need to get out of here.”  
  
  But I was rooted to where I stood, and I finally understood why people rubbernecked car accidents. I knew what was coming, and I knew it was something I didn’t want to see, but I couldn’t look away.  
  
  One of the forms stepped forward, the edges of its body pulsing red as it raised a glowing arm.  
  
  The truck jerked forward; the shadow of a man behind the wheel and a much smaller body beside it would be forever etched into my memory.  
  
  Tiny sparks of electricity flew from the Luxen’s hand as a brilliant light tinged in red curled down its arm. A second later, a bolt of light radiated from it, snapping into the air, smelling like burned ozone. The light—a blast straight from the Source of what had to be the purest kind—smacked into the truck.  
  
  The explosion rocked the store as the truck went up in flames, flipping over into the line of cars next to it. An inferno poured out of the busted windshield as the truck crashed down on its roof, tires spinning aimlessly.  
  
  Chaos erupted. Screams shattered the silence as people ran from the front of the store. Like a herd, they pushed into carts and other people. Bodies went down on hands and knees, and the screams pitched louder, mingling with the cries of young children.  
  
  In a stuttered heartbeat and in the blink of an eye, the Luxen were in the store and they were everywhere. Archer yanked me around the end of the shelf, pressing our bodies against the sharp edges. A teenage boy raced past us, and all I could think was how red his hair was—like scarlet—and then I realized it wasn’t his hair color but blood. He made it to the body-wash section before a burst of light hit him in his back. The boy went down, face-first and unmoving, as a charred hole smoked from the center of his spine.  
  
  “Jesus,” I gasped as my stomach roiled.  
  
  Archer stared, eyes wide and nostrils flared. “This is bad.”  
  
  I inched to the edge of the aisle and peered around, my stomach flopping when I saw the woman who’d been holding the small girl minutes before.  
  
  She was standing in front of one of the Luxen, her mouth gaping open, seemingly frozen in fear. The little girl was pressed back against the rack of supermarket books, huddled into a small ball, wailing as she rocked back and forth. It took me a moment to realize what she was shrieking over and over again.  
  
  “Daddy! Daddy!”  
  
  The man was lying in a pool of blood at her feet.  
  
  Energy crackled along my skin, snapping against Archer as the Luxe  
n reached out and placed a hand on the center of the woman’s chest.  
  
  “What the . . . ?” I whispered.  
  
  The woman’s spine straightened as if someone had dropped steel down the center of her back. Her eyes widened, pupils dilating. The shimmery white light radiated from the Luxen’s palm, and then draped over the woman like a waterfall. When the light reached her pointy-toed high heels, it faded off, seeping into the floor. Suddenly, the woman’s head kicked back and her mouth dropped open in a silent scream. Her veins lit up from within, a glowing white network across her forehead, filling her eyes, and then down her cheeks and throat.  
  
  What was happening? I could feel Archer pressing against me as the Luxen stepped back from the violently trembling woman. As the light receded from her veins, the color leached from her skin, and the light surrounding the Luxen pulsed like a heartbeat. It all happened at the same moment—the woman’s skin wrinkled and creased like she was aging by decades within seconds, while the Luxen’s form shifted and warped. The woman’s body crumbled and caved into itself, like all her life force was sucked right out of her. As she folded like a sheet of paper, skin gray and features unrecognizable, the Luxen’s light pulled back, revealing its new form.  
  
  It was identical to the woman, same tan skin and pert nose. Light brown hair fell over bare shoulders, but its eyes . . . they were an unnaturally brilliant blue, like two polished sapphires had been placed on its face. Eyes like Ash’s and Andrew’s.  
  
  They’re assimilating DNA. Archer’s voice floated among my thoughts. Rapidly. I’ve never seen it done or known it was possible. There was a level of disturbed awe in his tone.  
  
  It was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the Luxen version. It was also deadly, and it was happening throughout the supermarket. Bodies were hitting the floor everywhere.  
  
  “We need to go.” Archer’s hand tightened around mine as he pulled me back against him. “Now.”  
  
  “No!” I tried to dig in. “We—”  
  
  “We don’t need to do anything but get the hell out of here.” He hauled me around the end of the shelves, tugging me toward him until I was plastered against his side once more.  
  
  I struggled as he guided me down the aisle. “We can help them.”  
  
  “We can’t,” he gritted out.  
  
  “You’re an Origin,” I snapped. “You’re supposed to be the badass alien test-tube baby, but you’re—”  
  
  “Running? Hell, yeah. Origin or not, there are dozens of Luxen, and they are powerful.” He pushed me around the rows of toothpaste. In his left hand he still carried the bin full of pills I’d already forgotten about. “Did you not just see what they did?”  
  
  I slammed my hand into his stomach, pushing him back as I tore myself free from his grasp. “They’re killing people! We can help them.”  
  
  Archer snapped forward, his face contorting in frustration. “There is no Luxen on this Earth who can take on DNA like that. These are stronger. We need to get out of here, get back to the cabin, and then get the—”  
  
  A scream made me whip around. From the end of the aisle, I could see that the Luxen who’d taken on the woman’s appearance was staring down at the small girl, her lips curled into a mocking smile.  
  
  No. No way could I leave the girl. I had no idea what the Luxen planned, but I doubted it involved a test run at motherhood. I glanced at Archer, who cursed under his breath.  
  
  “Katy,” he growled, dropping the bin. “Don’t.”  
  
  Too late. I took off, my legs and arms pumping as I darted into the next aisle and ran toward the front of the store. The clap of thunder came again as I reached the display of paperbacks, and the parking lot lit up as more Luxen arrived, over and over again, thunder cracking until I thought my heart would implode.  
  
  I skidded around the end of the aisle.  
  
  The Luxen froze in front of the little girl, and then its head tilted toward where I stood. Brilliant eyes locked onto mine. Rosy red lips parted. The coldness in its stare was like stepping out in subzero temps. There was nothing human in the stare, not even a hint of compassion, just cold calculation.",1,1755023253.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

We’ve lived together for about eight months, and it’s mostly been fine… until her boyfriend Matt started practically living here.

At first, it was small stuff my coffee mug, my phone charger, a throw blanket I kept on my bed. I’d find them in the living room or kitchen and brush it off. But then it escalated. My expensive shampoo would be half gone in a week, my favorite hoodie disappeared for a month, and I even caught him using my hairbrush.

I talked to Kara about it and she said Matt just feels comfortable here and probably thinks it’s all communal. I told her that my things are not communal, and I want him to stop. She agreed but nothing changed.

Last week, I came home from work early and found Matt in my room sitting at my desk using my laptop. I lost it. I told him to get out and then went to the hardware store that night and bought a lock for my bedroom door.

Kara flipped out, saying I was making things hostile and treating Matt like a criminal. I told her that’s exactly how you treat someone who keeps taking your stuff without permission. Now she’s barely speaking to me and making passive-aggressive comments about trust issues.

I was messing around with an AI script for a personal budgeting tool. All I wanted was a clean CSV export of expenses. That’s it.

Instead, the AI decided it would be a good idea to also generate monthly spending “insights”: including a ranking of “top unnecessary purchases”.



Guess what was number one?

The coffee machine I bought last month. Twice.

1mogewx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mogewx/my_sister_physically_abuses_me_and_my_parents_do/,My sister physically abuses me and my parents do nothing about it (extreme long),"I (F17) have had a difficult relationship with my sister (F23) since we were young. Obviously we had the typical sibling arguments and would make up in an hour or so. On January 23, 2023 we had our first real physical altercation where we actually threw pouches at each other. She was organizing my nieces toys in the living room and sent her to the kitchen for a bag for the trash. I was in the process of making food so I pointed her to where they were. I was sick, I had a fever, was so irritated and she started acting dumb I opened the cabinet under the sink and told her to grab it. She continued saying where is it where is it laughing so I knew she just wanted me to grab it for her,and I deeply do regret this but I grabbed the top of her head and under her chin (not her neck her chin) moved it to the cabinet under the sink where the plastic bags were at she stared at me grabbed the bag and immediately ran to my sister saying I choked her. Obviously mama bear mode flipped in her and she came at me, cornered me and was screaming in my face. I told her to get out of my face because I didn’t choke her. At this point she was so close to my face I could feel the spit when she would talk landing on my face so I did not even push I slightly put my hand on her shoulder and pushed her away from me. This is were she grabbed me by my hair and we started fighting. At this time I was 13 and 115 pound while she was around 19-20 and 200 pounds. I was obviously overpowered. By the end of the fight she had me on the ground and it took my grandpa and dad to get her off of me. Next day she tried to talk to me and I ignored her because I was obviously still very mad, and I went no contact with her. She then apologized in May 2023 and we were on speaking terms again until July 2023.

She was not working and we always clean for my mom while she’s at work when I am home from school. Everything was clean but the dishes in the kitchen where my sister was eating. She came to my room and told me to come wipe down the counters and wash the dishes I left my room and saw that her plate was out and some other stuff she was putting on her food. I told her i’d do it after she’s done eating. We’ve had minor arguments over this same situation where i was cleaning the counters and she was eating and got mad. She immediately got heated I went back to my room and she came and opened my door and told me she wasn’t leaving until I went to wash the dishes I tried pushing her out of my room and she scratched me up in the process, took my phone, threw it in the neighbors yard, and left the house. I went no contact with her until September 2023 where my grandma broke her back and ended up in the hospital.

We got into a minor argument in February 2024. (she does not let anyone eat any of the food she buys). I got home from school and she was making my niece some dinosaur chicken nuggets I had bought. I made a joke around the lines of can I eat the stuff you buy now. She immediately got mad and said she doesn’t let me have any of the food she buys bc I eat it all. She got mad and didn’t talk to me so I didn’t talk to her. Next day at school she stole my baking power (makeup) and I immediately noticed because i keep them on my vanity stacked with another powder. I went in her room and not surprisingly it was on her desk. I checked the bottom of it because i have black hearts on all of my stuff because i have a sister and we get ready together and didnt want our stuff getting mixed up. I immediately told my mom she she called her because at the time she was at the gym w a dude. She answers denies she took it and her and the dude start laughing. Which is like hello you took it out of my room without asking, get caught, and then deny it? I went no contact with her again.

Another minor disagreement in March 2024. At this time my great grandpa passed away and my mom was in Mexico, and at this time my mom, dad, and sister all worked at the same place so they got days off. I came back from school and I saw my clothes was on a shoe rack. I went down and checked the dryer it was empty and my clothes was all wrinkled so I put the clothes back in so they can heat up a little and I won’t have a bunch of wrinkled clothes i have to iron. I went up to my room and as I was coming back with more clothes I see my sister taking out my clothes and putting hers in. So I was mad because the washer had been done she was home all day nothing was cleaned so she clearly wasn’t busy enough to not pay attention to her clothes. I start putting my clothes back and that’s when we start shoving each other and she puts hers arms around me and starts calling for my dad and he gets her off of me. I understand that I shouldn’t have put my hands on her in this moment especially over a dryer. I  received my consequences and was grounded for around a week and a half. After this fight she kicked me out of all out streaming services and canceled my phone so I had to get a new phone.

During this my school had a weird week with act testing and practice act so I was home mostly all week. My boyfriends sister had a soccer game and she had asked me to go so I was cleaning making food and on my best behavior with my parents so I would be able to go. Asked my mom and she gave me the green light and I was officially ungrounded. Game was at 4 and it was around 2 I was grilling chicken for a salad and cutting it up on the counter right next to the stove. My sister got home and immediately got to making an egg for my niece and multiple times bumped into me and I remained calm because I knew it was on purpose and I wanted to go to the game. I was still cutting the chicken where the went in front of my torso to open the utensil drawer I was standing in front of. I told her something along the lines of you can say excuse me , and she said why would I. So I pushed the cabinet in with my body and that’s when she grabbed my arm that had the knife. I froze not wanting to move because I wanted to go to see my boyfriend. She kept yelling at me to drop the knife as if I had picked it up and pointed it at her like okay weirdo. My mom came out of her room and she let me go which made the knife fly out of my hand and she went to her room yelling how she was going to kill me and that she’s been wanting to put her hands on me for a while. ( I have this all audio recorded). I ended up getting grounded and ungrounded the next day. I went no contact with her again

Next Physical fight we had was in October 2024. Got home from school my mom was making food and my sister was leaving for the gym. My niece was upset the food wasn’t ready and ran off to her little tent and was bawling. So I went and I was like cmon let’s go eat some fish nana has it ready and she yelled no and slapped me so hard my head turned to the side. I pushed her and told her to next slap me again and I went and told my mom and showed her. She called my niece to wash her hands and she told my mom I PUSHED HERR. Remember that. My mom swatted me on the but joking around and my niece got mad and ran to her room. I’m unsure if my niece called my sister or if she forgot something but my sister ended up coming back and my niece told her once again that I choked her. My mom i think suspected something was up and went to their room and i heard my sister screaming about how she has told me to stop putting my hands on her daughter and that this is the second time i’ve choked her. So i yelled something along the lines of I didn’t choke her maybe if you payed attention to her she wouldn’t say things like that to get your attention. She got immediately heated and started coming at my trying to jump over my mom as she was in between us. She threw my backpack and broke some sticks my teacher gave me for a project basically all the dramatics. She reached over my mom, yanked my hair and I defended myself. My parents separated us, and I ran to my room and called the police. Her dude friend came, and started lecturing my mom about what could happen to my sister and my niece if the police get involved. Which i’m not stupid i know what could happen and that’s exactly why I called them. My sister left.The police arrived and said they really couldn’t do anything because she wasn’t there and I didn’t have any scratches or bruises on me other than a red mark where she slapped me. She ended up with a couple scratches and a bruise on her eyelid. Again I continued with no contact.

Our biggest fight happened on January 8th, 2025. At this time she was jobless and had gone to an interview. I was in the kitchen and i have a bad habit of putting my leg on the stool next to me. She gets home and starts heating up her food with her phone on max. I was ignoring her because i know it’s just to aggravate me. Next thing i know the chair is pulled away from me and in this moment i know i messed up but i froze and i kept my foot on the chair and she was pulling it i realized what was happening i stood up and was about to walk by her when she grabbed my hair and we started fighting. My grandpa separated us I went to my room and called my dad. I thought she left as that’s what she does after every fight so I went out and i hear her screaming at my dad about how i choke her daughter and put my hands on her and i say i don’t touch your daughter i don’t even talk to her anymore stop using that as an excuse to put your hands on me. She comes at me again yelling in a b word and we fight again during this it’s not even throwing punches it’s trying to get her off of me so i’m trying to kick her off scratching at her arms so she can let my hair go. she goes to her room and i end up sitting with my grandpa trying to calm him down as he has asthma. The second he calms down and says he’s okay my sister comes out running yelling i’m a b word and i ruined her life. we fight again we get separated again this goes on another 3 or 4 times where she comes at me and we get separated. In the end she’s rocking side to side as if there was an invisible wall she couldn’t cross yelling things at me. I’m sitting down on the couch with my dad grabbing my arms and his back to her. I say dude you’re a bum get a life she yells oh i’m a bum i’m a bum and throws a glass mineragua at me and i get soaked in the water. It ends she goes to her room and i’m begging my dad to let me call the police on her and he refuses. Out of respect I don’t and we’re on the stairs and i hear a knock on the door so i open it thinking it was my dad and behold her knight in shining armor sneaky link is at the door i immediately shut the door because i have no reason to deal with him and he begins pounding on the door like a police officer i open the door and i start yelling at him saying who do you think you are coming to my door like that. He starts saying oh well if you knew things were heated why didn’t you just leave. Hello??  At this point i know what my sister has been feeding this bald headed idiot and i get mad i say your girlfriend is a grown woman she should know when something is right or wrong and she equally knew how things were why aren’t you yelling at her with this. He says this goofy ass thing talking about some if you took a polygraph test would you pass. I said yeah dork because i didn’t touch my niece. My dad respectfully tells him he didn’t appreciate the way he came at me and arrived at his house and asks him to leave. Ig he told my sister but she came and let him in. Around this time I hear the police arrive. I’m scared shitless because i know that she has real bruises and actual scratches on her so lm texting my boyfriend what happens and that if i go to jail ill call him. She called the police. Admitted to them that she hit my first bug failed to mention she came at me 6-7 times. The police officer told me he couldn’t just let this go this time like the last officer because there was harm inflicted to a minor. So she got arrested spend 3 days in jail and spent a month at her best friends house when she told my parents she couldn’t afford living on her own and her best friend of around 10 years couldn’t have her at her house anymore. She returned in February with the promise of her moving out in less than 2 months. She’s still here.

Things have been somewhat calm other than her throwing my wet clothes on the floor, sorting out my clothes from my moms when drying, throwing away my food, her thinking she’s not washing my dishes (i wash my dishes the second i’m done with them so??), her leaving messes for me to clean as i am on summer break.

August 9th me, my mom, dad, and a friend of mine were going to the carnival. I was at my grandmas prior, and she lives and hour away. So as soon as me and my mom woke up we got coffee and breakfast sandwiches, and we left to pick up the carnival tickets. I got home showered, and since we spent the night i had my lotions and makeup in my bag which was in my moms room i waited till my sister went into her room and i left to get them. As i was coming back from my moms room my sister leaves her room, and so im going and she’s coming. i turn my body so we wont bump into each other, and from me half turned she still managed to shoulder bump me. I didnt move more because from me turned it was enough for both of us to pass the hallway. Prior times we’ve bumped into eachother like this she never moves so i’m tired of the disrespect towards me. We shoulder bump each other my mom says to stop with this, and i tell my mom she didn’t move. She called me a b word and I went on my way to my room because I don’t have time to deal with her childish teenager act. I get to my room and i hear a crash and i immediately knew she broke my Hello kitty cup. I don’t really collect hello Kitty but that was my only mug and it was pretty expensive as it cost me $30. When i got home from the carnival i search the trash and i find my cup and my smushed up breakfast sandwich. I tell my mom she did it on purpose im crying hysterically at this point because im so mad and she keeps telling me my sister didn’t do it on purpose. I’m mad because it’s my money going to waste and i start looking for all her mugs and plates bowls and glass cups. Mysteriously after my cup breaks she takes all her things to her room. I know i seem crazy but i grew up around her i know how she is and i know how she thinks. I immediately knew it wasn’t an accident because the mug is so big i only use it to eat soups or ice cream sundays. Plus the mug was in between another larger mug and a measuring cup at the top of the cabinet so it’s not just going to accidentally fall and break without the others breaking as well . Next day Sunday I get ready to shower and when i go to use my conditioner it’s empty. I was confused because i had showered that day prior and it was not even half way empty. I thought maybe i left it open and it spilled. I use the remainder of the conditioner and im rinsing my hair i grab my murad face wash wow Unsurprisingly empty too. I tell my mom “ My cup accidentally breaks, my breakfast sandwich is accidentally thrown away, and now the only two things i bought with my own money are gone, but yeah it was a mistake mom.” My mom confronts her and my sister denies it. I don’t have any other siblings my parents wouldn’t do that because they’re grown adults so i’m left feeling crazy. My mom tells her she needs to stop with the childish acts or she’ll have to find somewhere else to live because her petty antics are costing her money. My sister says she can’t kick her out because my mom doesn’t pay the house and my grandpa does (my grandparents live with us and cant work but still help my mom with half of the mortgage). My mom says then based on your logic don’t grab the black car anymore and get your own car (My dad would let my sister use his car when she first got her license but then my sister claimed it as her car, never pays any of the notes and absolutely doesn’t pay the insurance & the car is all banged up from her getting into accidents).

Through this past year I have been in a deep depression as i feel abandoned by my parents as i feel they’re taking her side. I understand they can’t kick her out and leave her on the streets with my niece but her being here is costing me mentally. My parents refuse to let me tell any of my cousins what happened as they’re going to tell their parents and spread it around. I truly don’t care and i feel as if they deserve to see what i have to deal with. I also don’t understand how i ruined her life i’ve taken her side in arguments i knew she was in the wrong in and strained my relationship with my parents for her. My dad tells me it’s jealously because of how she spent her teen years and how im spending mine. My sister got pregnant at 14 and gave birth at 15. She didn’t finish highschool and is 23 with a 8 yo daughter who’s father is not present, no car, no highschool diploma or ged, and working at hobby lobby as a cashier. I truly feel as if it’s early enough for her to turn her life around. I know she’s doing these things to try and provoke me to start a fight but cps had been involved and already threatened to take my niece away if she continues to argue and start fights with me. I’m currently at a loss as i know that the only way to save myself from this is leaving or pressing charges on her but i feel empathy for my niece as much as i feel this is her fault. I know i didn’t do anything wrong but i know other people may not feel that way. I’m currently scared she’ll do anything to get me heated up and fight her, and as much as i’m avoiding her she’s  still finding ways to get in my way and start something. She truly thinks she and her daughter are the victims in this situation but i don’t feel that way. I know i could just be taking my own side. I’d love to hear what others think on this situation and get feedback on how i can improve my behavior around her. I don’t wish to start problems with her but i can’t help it if she keeps bumping into me getting in my space and spilling things on me. Thank you if you’ve read this far but it’s so much to the story and i still had to leave a lot of things out.💗💗",6,1755022581.0,offmychest,2,1.0,False
1mogemj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1mogemj/can_i_help_my_boyfriend_with_his_inability_to/,Can I help my boyfriend with his inability to handle stress?,"If my boyfriend experiences a few setbacks, he has a tendency to let it snowball and become a bigger deal than it is. I'm worried about how this might affect us in the future.

For example - one time we missed our flight because he got the time wrong. It was understandable as he had been super stressed and sleep deprived due to work. He was super hard on himself about it as he is a bit of a perfectionist and he considered this a failure. I'm pretty chill and these things don't bother me, I am good with just letting it roll off my back.

The next day he tried to make breakfast and burned the pancakes, it set off the smoke alarm. 

This combined with the flight being missed put him in a bad headspace. Because of the pancakes burning, he didn't have a coffee, then got a headache, etc. I tried to comfort him but somehow it got into a conversation about work which made him more stressed, he said he just needs time alone to process and was appreciative I tried to help. I let him have that alone time but then he got worried I was upset at him, I wasn't.

I know life gets more stressful later on. We want to have kids. I'm pretty sure there might be a situation where everything is going wrong and kids are screaming in the backseat which makes everything worse. I am afraid of what he will be like in that scenario when there is no option to just be alone and process things. I don't want to carry the emotional burden of the whole relationship in a situation like this, I want someone who can stay calm and patient even when it feels like the world is on fire. 

Have you guys improved on patience after kids or, as did you mellow out as you got older?

To be fair he has improved a LOT after we first started dating, he used to be a lot worse. He has never taken out his anger on me or even yelled at me.

I've been having a blast with my Echo mini! I spend about $80 USD for the audio player and headphones. I was getting increasing frustrated of music apps on my phone and having an ad pop up every time I wanted to change a song. I have never been too fond in streaming music because I don't want to pay a monthly sub just to listen to some tunes. I listen to a lot of VGM so much of the OST are not on Spotify. Even if they were, I have no interest in giving money to Spotify or YT.  

The battery life isn't bad, I've spent about 4 hours at a time and only went down half battery. I'm not an audio expert but what I can say is that the headphones have such a great base! 

This small device is very compact and it's been doing the job extremely well. It isn't perfect, as the buttons on the top are very clicky. Not really ideal for sitting in a chill coffee shop. The interface could also use a lot of work with controlling the volume and switching the tracks, which can be very annoying. While the screen is in sleep mode, if you press and hold down the volume down button, it switches tracks. But I am so used to holding down the volume keys to lower the music quickly. This does not allow you to remap the buttons, which I hope that will be a feature in a future update.  The headphones are top tier and worth the money! However, the volume controls on the headphones do not work with the device, unfortunately. 

Despite this I am very happy with my purchase and super exited to start the journey of separating from my phone! Thanks to this community for helping me decide! I've been lurking for a while here and I love seeing the many Daps! ",3,1755022561.0,DigitalAudioPlayer,1,1.0,False
1mogdyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SleepApnea/comments/1mogdyx/is_it_possible_to_have_mild_sleep_apneaahi_86/,"Is it possible to have ""mild"" sleep apnea(AHI 8.6) with severe symptoms?","I(16F) was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea with an AHI of 8.6, I believe the cause is my chronic rhinitis. I know almost nothing about sleep apnea, but I found it strange that the result was ""mild,"" since the fatigue I feel is anything but mild. It's been 3-2 years since it started and has been getting worse ever since. This year the symptoms impacted my life so much that my mother finally took me to the doctor.
For a good night's sleep, I need 14 to 17 hours of sleep, and even then, I feel tired all day and have ""sleep attacks."" Sometimes they're weak and short, other times strong and long, so intense that my brain slows down, I feel dizzy, and I feel like I'm going to pass out. I get so tired that my body ""hurts."" It's not the normal kind of pain; I just don't know how to explain it better. It's like an ""ache"" or discomfort, as if my body is already asleep or trying to make me pass out. It leaves me weak and I have to sit down.
I often end up falling asleep unintentionally. This happens anywhere: on the bus, in the car, at school. I've even fallen asleep standing up and feel like I'm almost dozing off while walking. I can't pay attention in class or studying because I fall asleep even when I'm writing, or I have microsleeps that leave my memory completely confused. Sometimes I fall asleep without even realizing it. I can't focus in class because I sometimes fall asleep in less than 2 minutes. When I'm not sleeping, my brain is so slow that I can't learn anything or do basic reasoning. No matter how hard I try, I can't stay alert. Drinking water doesn't work, coffee has a very short effect on me, or sometimes it doesn't even work, moving around doesn't work either. I don't take naps during the day because if I sleep, it will be for 8 hours straight, otherwise it doesn't make a difference. 
I'm relieved to finally have a diagnosis, but I'm really confused about how this is mild.
