1gqusjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1gqusjq/has_anyone_here_had_a_positive_experience_with/,Has anyone here had a positive experience with anti-depressants?,"I see a lot of posts on here about how anti-depressants are poison and if they help then it is probably just placebo. In the past I have been prescribed different medications like lexapro, zoloft, wellbutrin, prozac, and others. All gave me horrible side effects except for prozac and without prozac I am not sure if I would have made it past 2022. My only hesitation is long-term effects of these drugs. 

The end of 2022 was by far the worst time in my life emotionally. I was truly a broken person. I haven't taken anything since maybe summer of 2023 but I'm thinking I may need something again. I went to a coffee shop today to read and maybe do some job searching but I felt such a rush of anxiety and real negative thoughts I had to leave and immediately call someone. Fundamentally, I think I am a weak person and no amount of exercise or journaling really helps. It sucks to feel this way and rely on a crutch like anti-depressants, but I don't know where else to turn.

[Scene: The Griffin living room. Peter, Chris, Meg, Lois, and Stewie are gathered around a shiny new iMac on the table, all looking perplexed.]

Peter: (grumbling) So Lois said we needed a ‚Äúfamily computer‚Äù for everyone, right? So I got this‚Ä¶ this iMac. But where‚Äôs the rest of it? It‚Äôs just a big, shiny‚Ä¶ screen!

Lois: (sighing) Peter, the store guy said it was all-in-one. I thought that meant it was easier to use.

Meg: (rolling her eyes) And yet, it‚Äôs already crashed three times while setting it up.

Stewie: (smugly) Yes, behold the marvel of modern technology‚Äîan overgrown smartphone with one USB port, cleverly hidden, to keep us all guessing.

Peter: (looking under the screen) Why are all the ports in the back? It‚Äôs like a secret code just to plug in a thumb drive. (tries plugging something in, grunts in frustration)

Chris: Why does it need to look so fancy? It‚Äôs a computer, not a fashion model.

Meg: (sarcastically) Oh, don‚Äôt worry, Chris. Looking good while being useless is totally in right now. Isn‚Äôt that right, Stewie?

Stewie: (smirking) Right you are, Meg. Apple‚Äôs motto is practically ‚ÄúStyle over Substance.‚Äù Like buying a Ferrari that only has a gas pedal and no brakes.

[Brian walks in with a dry look, sipping a martini.]

Brian: Let me guess: Peter tried to turn it on without the fingerprint scan.

Peter: What do you mean, ‚Äúfingerprint scan‚Äù? It‚Äôs a computer, not my parole officer!

Lois: (nodding, frustrated) And it took me two hours just to set up an account. Why did it ask me what my favorite fruit was?

Stewie: Ah, yes, Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúfruit-themed security.‚Äù Only people who can guess the password ‚Äúbanana‚Äù get access to the internet.

Meg: (clicking on the screen and frowning) I think I just opened‚Ä¶ the music app? Why is it asking me to subscribe just to listen to one song?

Peter: Oh, perfect! Next thing, they‚Äôll charge us to look at our own photos. But hey, at least it‚Äôs shiny while it robs us blind!

Lois: (crossing her arms) All I wanted was a simple computer that works. This one just feels like it‚Äôs judging me every time I make a mistake.

Brian: Yep, welcome to Apple products. You have to earn their respect just to get the internet.

Stewie: (sarcastically) Ah yes, Apple‚Äîthe only company that makes you feel worse about your intelligence just for owning one of their products.

[Cutaway Scene: Peter at Starbucks with the huge iMac]

Peter: (whispering, looking around) Okay, I‚Äôm going to be the coolest guy in here with my brand-new iMac. Let‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ (struggles to pull it from the bag, knocking over a cup) ‚Ä¶stand out. Yep. Cool as ever. (sits awkwardly with the massive computer on the small coffee shop table)

Barista: (eyeing him suspiciously) Sir, we usually mean laptops.

[End Cutaway, back to the living room]

Chris: (randomly tapping on the iMac screen) Why isn‚Äôt it doing anything? Are we‚Ä¶ not cool enough for it?

Stewie: (giggling) Clearly. Only people who take it out for $8 lattes and whisper, ‚ÄúIt just works‚Äù are allowed to use it.

Meg: Well, I think I‚Äôm cool enough. (taps it again, and the iMac freezes with a spinning rainbow wheel)

Peter: (groans) Okay, that‚Äôs it. (grabs the computer) We‚Äôre taking this back. I don‚Äôt need to be outsmarted by a computer with a smiley face on the screen.

Lois: (relieved) Oh, thank you, Peter. Next time, we‚Äôre going with something normal‚Äîlike one of those computers with actual buttons.

[Fade out on Peter scratching his head, holding the iMac as the family gathers around, finally agreeing that maybe they should go ‚Äúbutton-based‚Äù next time.]

Maybe you wanted the masseuse's hands to drift toward intimate parts of your body.

Maybe you enjoy someone else using toys on your private areas.

But it never happened... So, the idea of having someone put all their attention on you sexually like this is what you crave.

With time, patience and attention we can together have a life-changing erotic experience. Nothing is sexier than a woman who is open-minded and in-tune with her body. I enjoy giving an erotic massage to this type of woman. Let's just say that I have a very special set of skills.

We can start by chatting and then meeting for coffee to talk about your desires. Your comfort will come easy as you notice that I am a pure gentleman and that I am trustworthy. I'm a very a clean-cut Italian man with a warm smile and soft yet firm hands. We discuss desire and comforts about what you like and how the massage would proceed.

I know that sometimes having an orgasm takes a lot of work and that sometimes a woman focuses a long-time in order to orgasm. I don't want you to stress or try to concentrate so hard on not losing your focus. Let me help.

I would start with a caring gentle massage, absolutely relaxing your body. Then, my hands will start exploring the places you would always want a masseuse to explore. You're lying on your stomach while I work your legs and getting close to your upper thighs nearing your sweet spot. My soft hands work your inner thighs, teasing and playing. You shift your body so that my hands would get the message and see you getting wet.

I want you to think about this as orgasm therapy of the most erotic kind!

I want you to orgasm with intense pleasure like you feel an entire waterfall going down your body!

I want you to have a feeling of sublime and total pleasure!

Maybe you want more, so I turn you over and start massaging your breasts. You crave more and are now putty in my hands. You close your eyes and wait for my fingers to drift towards your breasts and nipples. My soft fingers are making your nipples hard. I am rubbing and then gently suck on each nipple by taking my time to devour them. My breast and nipple play is intense and builds up over a while. You get even wetter and then suddenly you are on fire. Your sensitive nipples are going to setup for another orgasm to rush through your body.

It's hard to think of anything that feels better than a man's hands, fingers and kisses all over your body. You think about this relaxed and cozy orgasm. Then, you start to think about how you could've come again and again. The whole time you are happy and smiling and in awe of your own naughtiness.

So, if you're interested then please message me and tell me all about yourself by sharing your age, location, ethnicity and what you look like. Thanks!",1,1731551552.0,MassageNearMe,0,1.0,False

Wesley‚Äôs genuinely curious and eventually asks if she has feelings for the guy. Beverly doesn‚Äôt try to avoid or neutralize the question.

30 M here and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this girl that I work with. I might sound werid, but her beauty just makes me fall in love with her everytime I see her lol. I‚Äôll explain the entire thing here:

About 3 months ago, she randomly asked me to help her connect something to the TV. Before that, I can tell she was just fiddling around acting like it wasn‚Äôt working. I went up and fixed it in seconds but the way the interaction happened I feel it was to speak to me. After that I bumped into the elevator with her a few times and had small talk and she seemed interested in a way but I didn‚Äôt take it on. I then noticed she would come into the area I worked in just to borrow a charger and it seemed like she did it to speak to me again (I might be wrong)

I then noticed when I had small talk with her about her weekend and asked ‚Äúnice who did you go with for your little trip‚Äù she said her boyfriend and after that she stopped talking to me lol. Again, I was a little burned about this and started to think it was maybe just a fad. She then started playing hot and cold games with me. She would constantly walk where the area I worked (even though she never had to because her desk is right at the entrance), she would say hi when we walked by each other in the halls and then she would ignore me and act cold. There was a time she was in the kitchen, with another coworker and when I went to get coffee it was a break of silence and I heard her say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go back to my desk now‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know if she thinks I‚Äôm a creep or if I like her but yeah it‚Äôs really strange. We had a work party, and I notice she would come really close to me and started playing with her hair, walking back and forth infront of me, and just find every opportunity to be there. There was even a point where I went into a disclosed room and she came in, acting like she‚Äôs on the phone. When looked at her she looked at me, looked down and left the room lol. Also that same night, I did try to engage conversation with her and this other co worker that works with her. In seconds, when I can tell it was going to get deep in the convo she said ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs go take pictures‚Äù to the other girl lol. I‚Äôm not too sure if she‚Äôs into me or she‚Äôs playing games. I understand she has a boyfriend but who does this? Am I tripping out? I really do like her, and want to be friends but how can I move on. I really think it‚Äôs toxic for me.

i‚Äôve still been doing it behind his back a little bit but ive slowed down a lot. i know im playing with fire. every time im with him im terrified he‚Äôs going to go on my phone and see a text from G or something but im so so conflicted. i feel extremely guilty about lying to him but i don‚Äôt know what a better option is. maybe i just need to end the relationship but i don‚Äôt want to lose him.

i‚Äôve still been doing it behind his back a little bit but ive slowed down a lot. i know im playing with fire. every time im with him im terrified he‚Äôs going to go on my phone and see a text from G or something but im so so conflicted. i feel extremely guilty about lying to him but i don‚Äôt know what a better option is. maybe i just need to end the relationship but i don‚Äôt want to lose him. 

i‚Äôve been taking this bartending class once a week to maybe transition into that and im trying to focus more on my career and getting internships and stuff but the temptation to go on sugar dates is always there. i don‚Äôt want to do this forever. i do have career ‚Äúaspirations‚Äù and stuff and i do see myself having a real relationship in the future but i don‚Äôt know if im ready to give up the lifestyle that sugar dating has allowed for me rn. making money doing dates makes me feel empowered and by giving it up it feels like im giving up my craft, my independence, and all the things i planned to save for in the coming years. nothing i can do work wise right now will compare to it. i want both but i don‚Äôt know if i can sustain that without the guilt eating me alive or it blowing up in my face. what do you think i should do?",1,1731551347.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1gquizd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gquizd/need_advice_how_to_handle_my_exs_spouse_who_keeps/,Need Advice: How to Handle My Ex‚Äôs Spouse Who Keeps Showing Up Everywhere I Go,"I (F36) need advice on handling a bizarre situation with my ex‚Äôs (M38) wife (F35). She‚Äôs been ‚Äúrunning into‚Äù me everywhere for years, and it‚Äôs honestly exhausting.

For context: My ex and I broke up over a decade ago. We were on and off for five years, and our relationship had its issues. He started seeing his now-wife while we were together and eventually broke up with me to pursue her. I‚Äôve respected that from the moment he ended things (and ran off on a bicycle, which is ridiculous but paints the picture of who we‚Äôre dealing with here).

They‚Äôre now married with a child‚Äîaround 3? I try not to track their lives. I‚Äôve been trying to move on by avoiding mutual spots and sticking to new routines, but his wife keeps showing up in places I frequent, like my favorite coffee shop and even an outdoor tai chi class I used to go to. She stood nearby a couple of times in a way that felt off, so I eventually quit the class because it creeped me out.

I work in a job where I‚Äôm walking around the neighborhood at predictable times, and she always seems to show up where I am, making it hard to feel at ease during my workday.

This has gone from strange to unsettling. At first, it was little things‚Äîliking and unliking my Instagram posts late at night, poking me on my long abandoned Facebook account, or posting random photos of my apartment building. It escalated to in-person run-ins. I tried to brush it off as coincidence, but the frequency of these encounters makes it hard to ignore. I even reached out to both of them years ago when it was just online behavior (screenshots exist, but I won‚Äôt share those). She brushed it off as ‚ÄúLol, honest mistake,‚Äù and he told me to ‚Äúmove on.‚Äù After that, I noticed a burner Instagram account, which I believe was hers, always watching my stories. When I blocked it, the account was deleted the same day.

I feel like I‚Äôm being gaslit into thinking I‚Äôm imagining things, but these in-person encounters are so frequent (sometimes daily) that it‚Äôs affecting my peace of mind. I‚Äôve tried everything to avoid this situation: changing routines, quitting tai chi, and even avoiding friendships with people who live on their block. She‚Äôs still there, and it feels like she has control over my life, and I don‚Äôt understand why.

For the record, I‚Äôve been nothing but respectful of their relationship. The oddest part? My ex only acknowledges me with a polite wave when his wife isn‚Äôt around. If she‚Äôs with him, he looks at the ground and seems‚Ä¶ sad, I guess? But that‚Äôs not my business.

Some context: I wasn‚Äôt a perfect girlfriend, and I don‚Äôt look the way I did when we were together. Life‚Äôs taken a toll, and my appearance isn't my main priority. I doubt this is jealousy; I‚Äôve never interfered in their lives. I‚Äôve never even had a conversation with her‚Äîjust casual nods when we pass by.

So, what gives? Does anyone have insights into what her motives might be? How do I set boundaries with someone who isn‚Äôt technically doing anything wrong but has such a strange hold over my peace of mind? I can‚Äôt change my work route, and I really wish working from home was an option.

Thanks for any insights!

I'm living solo in an apartment with a kitchen, a bathroom, a tiny living room, and a bedroom. Work keeps me pretty busy, so I don't have a lot of time for cleaning.The bathroom's the toughest for me. After every shower, I use a squeegee to wipe down the shower walls. I wipe down the sink with Clorox wipes once a week, and do a deep clean on the toilet and mop the floor once a month.

In the kitchen, thanks to my dishwasher, I just load it up every night and let it run, then put the dishes away in the morning. Every night, I vacuum the kitchen countertop with the handheld part of my Ecovacs T30s combo (using the finest attachment) and then wipe it down. For the floors in the living room and bedroom, I rely on the T30s robot vacuum. It's easy to control with my voice. I usually set it to vacuum and mop in that order, and it starts up every night when I get home. While it's doing that, I use the T30s handheld vac (with a medium-sized head) to clean the coffee table and desks. I wash the sofa covers once a month, or sooner if there's a spill. I make the bed every morning, spray some room spray before bed each night, and wash the sheets whenever I do laundry, which is usually once a week.

1gquev7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1gquev7/i_work_as_a_security_guard_in_a_secret_government/," I work as a security guard in a secret government facility, and this is what happened (Part 1) ","Buster growled softly, baring his teeth at me as he stood in defiance. His stance rigid and unyielding, his tail stiff, and ears pinned back - he watched my every move with alert eyes.

My 3-year-old German shepherd had intuitively figured out the prospect of an upcoming bath when he saw me reach for the towel, and decided to give me a hard time over it.

‚ÄúI know buddy. I am not happy about it either. But I will make it quick. I promise,‚Äù I tried to reason, holding up both hands to reassure him.

‚ÄòBut it‚Äôs not even been a week‚Ä¶‚Äô I could almost imagine him saying those exact words to me when he growled back in protest.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right...But listen, man. You‚Äôre dirty. I can feel your presence from here,‚Äù I said, standing ten feet away and pretending to cover my nostrils with my finger.

Buster, of course, didn‚Äôt care and continued to defy without hesitation.

I put my hands on my hip and sighed. My glance immediately shifted to a hose attached to a tap outside my quarters.

‚ÄúTell you what. I‚Äôll make it worth your while. You don‚Äôt mind the jet spray, right? In fact, you even tolerate it sometimes,‚Äù I said, pointing to the hose located only a few feet away.

‚ÄúHow about a little cooperation now, and I‚Äôll make you your favorite meal a little later?‚Äù I asked him, while reaching out to pick a can of chicken liver from the kitchen.

As I dangled the can in my hand, I could see it slowly chipping away at his resolve, his mind grappling with the pros and cons of my new proposal.

A moment later, Buster barked at me twice and slowly made his way out of the house. He sat by the garden tap, ready to receive his bath.¬†

I took a handful of lotion and began to rub it against his torso to remove all the muck and grime that was sticking to his body.¬† We had been quite busy lately, guarding the base and conducting multiple patrols along the perimeter every day. The rain a few hours ago certainly didn't help matters, with Buster leaping over puddles of water and actively rolling in the mud to escape the desert heat. I had to use a brush to remove the layers of dirt that had caked all over his body.

It‚Äôs been a strange week, to say the least. The days were busy but peaceful, while the nights brought scattered, random sounds. Their origins were a mystery, as they appeared not to originate from the base. But I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it, not yet anyway.

There is an air base located a couple of hours away from the facility, and it wasn‚Äôt unusual for them to conduct sorties at odd hours in the night. I assumed they were probably testing out some new technology. ¬†

My colleague Joe thought the same thing as well. But we couldn‚Äôt take any chances, and we both had a job to do. So we conducted regular patrols around the base just as a precautionary measure.

But deep down, I felt something nagging at me, like I was being watched by someone or something. I couldn‚Äôt exactly put it into words.

For a second, I wondered if Buster too felt the same way when I saw him suddenly lift his head up, listening intently with his ears up in attention.

I quickly turned back to check if there was anybody standing behind me, but I found no one. When I turned around to face him again, I saw him looking up at the night sky, his gaze focused and unwavering. ¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it buddy? You see something?‚Äù I asked him as I cleared away the foam from his face. Moments went by slowly. And then, just like that, as if nothing had happened, he put his head down and began pawing my leg, urging me to finish his bath. I sighed again and turned on the hose, to wash off all the soap.

He finally looked presentable and I have to admit, his coat glistened beautifully under the moonlight.

Before I could reach for his towel, Buster swiftly moved in to close the gap between us and looked me in the eye dead serious. He then shook his body vigorously, much like a wet dog trying to rid itself of wetness, and trotted off without bothering to look back.

I laughed out loud as I sat there, drenched in water. I knew I should have seen that coming. However, my smile quickly faded, as it also reminded me of Jessica, my ailing wife.

Before another thought could take shape in my mind, I heard a familiar voice blare across the radio.

‚ÄúMike, I need you down here. Get to the post quick.‚Äù

It was my colleague Joe and I replied back in the affirmative. I quickly grabbed my gear and signaled Buster to follow after me.

When I reached the post, I saw Joe standing there armed with his rifle. As a seasoned war veteran with two tours under his belt, Joe was a dangerous man and not to be trifled with. But he was also compassionate and wise beyond his years.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Joe?‚Äù I inquired, as I approached him near the entrance of the base.

‚ÄúI am not sure yet.¬† I thought I heard something at a distance. It could well be nothing.‚Äù he replied, after a brief pause.

‚ÄòWell, we‚Äôve had a lot of that going around all week‚Äô, I thought to myself.

He then turned around to look at me. ‚ÄúI want you to run a perimeter sweep first. Then go on patrol again. Take Buster with you‚Äù he said, before heading back to his post.

I started the jeep and drove out towards the perimeter. The engine hummed softly as I navigated the rough terrain, with Buster sitting alertly beside me. After finding nothing suspicious during my initial sweep, I decided to broaden my search radius.

A mile into the drive, Buster suddenly started barking, prompting me to stop the jeep immediately. He leaped onto the ground and dashed towards a boulder located a short distance away. I picked up my rifle and cautiously followed after him.

When I reached the spot, I keyed the mic attached to my shirt and said, ""Boss, you need to come see this.""

I knew he wasn‚Äôt going to be happy about leaving the guard post unmanned, but I thought he would prefer to come and inspect this himself.

Joe arrived ten minutes later, parking his vehicle next to mine. He walked towards the boulder overlooking a small pond, and switched on his torch to get a better look at the skeletal remains of an animal dumped nearby. Three other animal remains lay next to it, all appearing to be in a similar condition.

‚ÄúThese look like coyotes, probably stopping by to drink water from the pond before they were killed,‚Äù he observed, his voice expressing concern. ‚ÄúDid you find them like this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes‚Äù, I replied. ‚ÄúAnd they weren‚Äôt here when I drove through the same place this morning. I thought it was quite odd to be honest, to find four of them out here all at once in the middle of the desert, that too at this hour.‚Äù

Joe simply nodded in agreement.

‚ÄúWhat sort of creature do you think did this Joe?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean it must have a ravenous appetite to chew every sinew of flesh from the bone, and lick it this clean.‚Äù I said, leaning in take another look.

‚ÄúDo you think it could be the Chupacabra or something similar?‚Äù I continued, knowing fully well my question was a bit far-fetched, but I had to still get it off my chest.

Joe finally stood up, switched off his torch, and looked around the vast open desert in quiet contemplation.

‚ÄúThis is in fact the fifth sighting in less than a week, Mike, and all have occurred in close proximity to secure government installations. The one before this was even stranger, and happened near a military base, where an old buddy of mine continues to serve.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe told me in that instance, the remains belonged to a dog. There were no signs of flesh or connecting tissue from the nasal region to the abdominal section, while the region spanning from the abdominal cavity to the tail bone was left fully intact. The whole thing was carried out with surgical precision, and drew morbid praise from even the medic back at the base.‚Äù

""But how is that even possible? What are you suggesting, Joe?"" I asked, surprised by the tone of my own voice and my inability to hide my disappointment upon hearing about it for the first time.

‚ÄúThis is not a hunt for prey, Mike. This is a hunt for attention. Somebody is trying to make a point. And I‚Äôd say they are accomplishing their objective.‚Äù Joe said.

When we got back to the base, Joe updated the command centre about the new developments. I headed back to my quarters and lay down on my bed. The exhaustion washed over me and I immediately drifted to sleep.

*I looked at my Mickey Mouse watch. The time was 5:36 PM. I was licking my ice cream while sitting next to my mom in the car. To my right, was my 4 year old cousin Henry who was fast asleep on his mother‚Äôs lap.*

*In the front, my dad was driving the car with his brother seated next to him. Then a truck from the opposite side suddenly came in our lane, and rammed into our vehicle causing it to turn turtle.*

*With great difficulty, I managed to extricate myself and pulled my cousin out from the wreckage as well. And then suddenly, the car exploded and went up in flames‚Ä¶.*

I opened my eyes and realized I was still in bed. The same dream had come and gone a thousand times before. It has become a constant part of my life ever since I was a 9-year-old kid.

I slowly got off the bed and found my head hurting. I had barely slept since last night‚Äôs excitement, and my mood was already beginning to turn foul.

Buster was already awake. I gently patted him on the head as I walked into the kitchen to put a kettle of water on the boil, and turned on the TV.

My attention immediately shifted towards the news. There was a nuclear explosion in Russia in a small town that was just a couple of hours away from Moscow. The details regarding the explosion were still shrouded in speculation.

‚ÄúJust the kind of news to start the day,‚ÄùI groaned as I reached for a nearby chair in the kitchen.

‚ÄòBut what could have caused this?‚Äô I thought to myself a little later, and hoped the damage there was minimal.

I then looked at the clock and set about getting ready for work. I showered, ate my breakfast, and was out the door by 8, with a hot cup of coffee in hand. Buster raced ahead to get to the guard post.

Joe had already completed his shift, and was waiting for me to relieve him of his duties. We high-fived as usual, and he began to walk back to his quarters. I settled into my chair, and made an entry in the logbook.

My name is Michael Armesto, a 30-year-old security guard working for a secret government installation located in an obscure area in the hot Nevada desert. The facility is centered around a medium-sized building occupying 7,000 square feet of space.

A 10-meter-high wired fence had been erected around the base to provide added protection. There was nothing else around the facility for miles, with the exception of a few boulder fields and mountains in the distance.

For over 5 years now, my colleague Joe and I have been working in shifts to ensure the guard post is manned at all times. When compared to other secret government bases, the security requirements here are not as stringent. And yet, neither Joe nor I ever had any clue about the kind of work being done here.

Every day, like clockwork, a bus carrying 25 people would arrive at the facility at 9:00 AM sharp. I had to open the gates to let them through, once the customary security checks were performed.

These people always wore lab coats and looked like scientists. They would work in the facility until 5:00 PM, and leave by the same bus at the end of the day. In all that time, they never once smiled or waved at me. It was as if their bosses had strictly informed them to not even initiate eye contact with people outside their circle.

Anyway, I never took offense to any of that. My job was to provide security to the facility, and I was doing that to the best of my ability.

As I sat back in my chair, ready to take another sip of coffee, my phone began to ring. It was from the hospital, and I answered it. A minute later, I called Joe and asked him to stand in for me. He immediately understood.

When he arrived at the guard post, I apologized for the inconvenience and Joe simply nodded with a reassuring smile.

As I was about to climb into my jeep, I pointed my finger at Buster and said, ‚ÄúSTAY.‚Äù.

‚ÄúTake him with you Mike. She will be happy to see him‚Äù Joe said quickly intervening.

‚ÄúBut Boss, I don‚Äôt want to leave you here alone after last night.‚Äù I protested.

Joe waved his hand dismissively. ‚ÄúGet going Mike. That‚Äôs an order.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt worry about me. I‚Äôll be fine. Go see Jess and tell her I am rooting for her,‚Äù he said, before walking back to the guard post.

I put a leash on Buster and climbed into the jeep with him. I started the vehicle and began driving towards the city to check on my wife Jessica. She was receiving treatment for lung cancer at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital, which was a 5 hour drive from the base.

Jess had never smoked once in her life, and for her to go through all this hardship really broke my heart. I would have normally liked to stay by her side during this crisis, but I could not afford the cost of treatment on my own. Thankfully, the insurance from my government job so far helped me cover most of the medical expenses.

After arriving at the hospital, I headed straight to her room and found her with tubes attached to her mouth. She was heavily sedated and looked like she was in pain.

Buster was standing by the door looking glum. He could see that Jess was unwell. Buster came into my life as a surprise birthday gift from Jess, and he has been a part of our family ever since. The people working at the hospital regularly allowed him inside the premises, knowing fully well that his presence always helped to uplift her spirits.

I came to know from the doctor that Jess had suffered a heart attack due to long term COVID complications. While she was stable and out of danger for now, she did need to undergo an emergency surgery within the next 3 days. The surgery alone would cost $30,000, and that was not covered by my insurance policy.

I pulled Buster by the leash to tell him it was time to go, but he kept resisting. He wanted to sit by her side for some time, even though she was unconscious and unable to acknowledge his presence. So, I too pulled up a chair and sat beside him. It immediately brought back happy memories of our marriage.

We used to spend our summers going on long drives, visiting natural parks, or idly sitting by the beach, enjoying good food and playing all kinds of sports. Jess and I would also often embark on scenic routes, with no particular destination in mind, allowing the road to guide us towards hidden gems.

Whether it's a visit to a historic village or a hike through a lush green forest, all the shared experiences helped strengthen our bond as a family.

The two of us also enjoyed using Buster to pull pranks on each other. Whenever Jess gave him a bath, she would command Buster to go ‚ÄòShake‚Äô in front of me and I would get drenched in water, leading to fits of laughter all around. It was one of her favorite pranks.

So when I saw my wife on the bed with tubes attached to her mouth, I got the reality check I needed. I stood up from my chair and yanked harder at his leash; he didn‚Äôt resist this time and followed after me.

I walked out of the hospital feeling a bit dazed. As I started to drive back to the base, my mind was busy trying to come up with solutions. I had only $2000 in my bank account, and that clearly wasn‚Äôt enough.

‚ÄòMaybe I could contact an official from the government and apply for a loan?‚Äô I thought to myself. I kept driving while mulling on the best course of action.

Then, at a certain point, I suddenly snapped to my senses and immediately stopped the car. I had been driving for over 4 hours now. It was 7 in the evening, and night had already fallen.

Yet, I could not spot the base in the distance. Usually, by this time, the floodlights would have been turned on, and the facility would be easily visible for miles.

Instead, all I could see up ahead was pitch-black darkness. Something was wrong.

I tried calling Joe on his phone, but he was unreachable. I pressed the gas pedal and drove as fast as I could.

When I finally reached the facility, the situation looked much worse than I had feared. The entrance gate was left half open, with no one manning the guard post. The entire building just sat there in the darkness with no power. I tried calling on Joe‚Äôs number again. No response.

I then called Joe‚Äôs boss, who was stationed in Carson City, to inform him of the situation and possibly request reinforcements. He was unreachable as well.

‚ÄòWhat on earth is going on?‚Äô I asked myself. This was completely bewildering on so many levels.

I slowly drove up to the base, and stopped the jeep a short distance away from the front gate. I wanted to be able to make a quick exit, if things turned hostile. I took a torch light from the dashboard and unfastened my sidearm from the holster. After getting down from the vehicle, I softly whistled towards Buster to follow me.

When I walked past the gate and checked the guard post, I saw a body lying face down on the floor. From a distance, it was difficult to identify the person clearly, but as I got closer I recognized Joe‚Äôs uniform. I ran towards him and turned him around and got the shock of my life. I stumbled back in fear and hit the floor hard.

I don‚Äôt know what they did to Joe.

But he was lying there dead! Very dead!

It was like he had been zapped or electrocuted. The only thing that was remaining of him was his skeleton. Not an ounce of flesh was visible on his body. And yet his uniform looked in pristine condition.

‚ÄòHow is this even possible?‚Äô I asked myself.

It immediately reminded me of the dead coyotes I found on patrol the previous night.

‚ÄúCould this all be somehow related? Was this an execution? And was this carried out be the same group of people?‚Äù I wondered.

Joe‚Äôs rifle was still there, leaning against the wall. I holstered my sidearm and picked up his rifle. I checked the magazine. He hadn‚Äôt fired a single shot.

I then turned on the tactical light and started moving towards the government facility. No one could enter this building until they had a high level of clearance, and every person who had clearance, was issued an electronic key card to gain access. So I was shocked to see the door was left ajar here as well.

Before entering, I headed back to check the junction box. The darkness was making me paranoid and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to fix it first. When I reached the box, I discovered that the power had been deliberately shut down.

I turned it back on, and the entire place lit up like a Christmas tree.

But the whole facility wore a deserted look. The bus that was usually used to ferry the scientists was still parked at the parking lot.

I doubled back towards the entrance, and slowly entered the building with my rifle pointed forward. This was the first time I was setting foot inside the facility. And if this was supposed to be a top research lab, I wasn‚Äôt seeing any signs of it.

The place had been hastily evacuated. There was not a single soul in sight. All I could see was waste paper and computer cables strewn across the floor. Everything else had been cleared out.

Buster then took off on his own, and dashed towards the far end of the building. Something had caught his fancy and I followed after him. He stopped against a large couch and started barking at me.

I looked down and could see something metallic hidden underneath. I stretched my hand to retrieve an aluminum briefcase with blood stains all over it. Someone was obviously holding onto it for dear life, and then tossed it underneath as a last ditch attempt to prevent it from getting into the wrong hands.

‚ÄòDid the scientists manage to escape? Or did something bad happen to them, like it happened to Joe?‚Äô

‚ÄòCould the nuclear explosion in Russia have something to do with this?‚Äô

‚ÄúAre the two countries about to go to war? Is this to be viewed as an escalation,‚Äù I wondered.

A hundred questions were going through my mind now, and I had answers to none of them.

I decided to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible. I saw no point in staying, now that Joe was dead and the facility had also been cleared out. I ran back to my jeep, tossed the briefcase in the backseat, and began my drive back to the nearest city I could think of.

Twenty minutes into the drive, I began to get curious about the briefcase, and I had to stop the car to take a look. I switched on the light in my vehicle and opened the briefcase. There was some kind of a telescope inside.

On its base, it bore the insignia of a bright burning Sun with a single eye at it‚Äôs center. It also had a name tag attached to it that was labelled Korelo ZX4 ‚Äì 1969.

The telescope in itself was a strange looking contraption, the likes of which I had never seen before. It was the size of a camcorder, and comfortably fit within the palm of my hand.

There were two identical knobs on either side of the device. The one on the left moved freely clockwise or counter clockwise. It felt similar to those old radio transistors, where you could switch back and forth between stations.

The knob on the right looked the same but had a small pointer attached to it. It had limited range of motion and worked like a switch. Close to the pointer were 3 printed dots, one larger than the other in ascending order. I guess this signified the 3 levels in which this device functioned.

I held the telescope gently in my hand and peered into the eyepiece. With the moon being the only source of light in the desert, I could hardly spot a thing. I then turned the knob on the right, and the device immediately roared to life. I could even feel it mildly vibrating in my hand.

As I peered into the eyepiece again, I now had clear vision of the space all around me. A green display had opened up and was providing clean imagery with stunning levels of detail. I slowly started to turn the knob on the left, and the telescope began to zoom in and out.

I could now clearly see the creatures of the desert ‚Ä¶.miles away‚Ä¶ coming out their holes ‚Ä¶looking for prey. Their heat signatures capturing perfectly‚Ä¶ the contours of their own bodies as they moved swiftly across the sand.

As I kept zooming in further, I could also spot the local diner of the nearest town that was more than 50 miles away. I could not only figure out the make and model of cars parked in front of the restaurant, but also read the number plates on them.

And then I looked upwards, pointing the telescope at the night sky, hoping to see the stars a little more clearly. And suddenly everything became obscure. It was like staring at a blank wall.

I moved the telescope away looking confused. Everything looked normal. There was an abundance of stars scattered across the sky, and there were hardly any clouds. I looked into the telescope again, and started zooming back, and my heart suddenly skipped a beat.

Thousands of feet high up in the sky, a large spaceship was hovering mid-air. It was big enough to accommodate an entire football field. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest as I just kept staring at it for several moments.

Then I slowly began to pan the telescope across the skyline, and soon realized that I was in for an even bigger shock! There were at least two more spaceships thousands of miles away. Make no mistake. They were clearly visible as the one I was standing in front of.

‚ÄòOk Mike, What else you got?‚Äô I said out loud to myself.

I then turned my focus back to the ship in front of me, and turned the right knob again.

The second dot got highlighted on screen, and the telescope suddenly zoomed in to reveal the insides of the spaceship.

The unfolding images were a little grainy but still definitive enough to provide sufficient visual quality. It was like an X-ray, CT scan and MRI all rolled into one. As I kept adjusting the left knob to get a clearer visual, I could see a large workstation occupying most of the space inside the ship.

Close to the panel, two people were standing and conversing with each other. They did not look human at all. In fact, they looked like aliens!

By this point, I was already sweating even as the cool winds of the desert were hitting my face, and ruffling my hair. I continued to stare into the telescope completely transfixed. I turned the right knob one more time.

The last big dot got highlighted on screen, and then I suddenly started hearing weird noises. Buster who was keeping silent all this while, let out a soft howl and dug his face into the sand. But the noises didn‚Äôt stop. It sounded odd and animal like. Like the garbled speech of someone attempting to speak with a mouthful of water. I realized I was now eavesdropping on the aliens talking amongst themselves.

I think they figured this out as well. Because one of them abruptly stopped speaking, and walked towards a work station, and then punched something on the console.

In a matter of moments, the other alien turned around and took a step forward in my direction. It looked like he was peering down at me, fully aware of my existence. A wry smile appeared on his lips, and I felt a shiver go down my spine.

I immediately switched off the telescope, put it back in the briefcase and ran towards my jeep. Buster followed after me. I decided to get to the nearest town and drove as fast as I could.

1gqucub,https://i.redd.it/5rxomuo91s0e1.jpeg,Update: I Love Swiss Products,"
Recently i posted a topic ""I love swiss products"". I ordered a few of the cheaper items that where recommend and available on Amazon


u/Lanxy & u/whateber2 & u/stwyg & u/attempt9001 & u/aureleio

All of you all recommend the Rex style peeler. I purchased the red one frlm victorinox.  My initial thoughts. On design, it is absolute simplicity. No masted material and ergonomic.  My initial thought when i picked it up was that it almost seemed to light weight. I didn't realize how heavy my Oxo peeler was. I test peeled a potato.  The ergonomics are nice, and they fit in hand nicely.  I think this will stay in my kitchen.

--------

u/b00nish & u/Fun_universe & u/Bakeey & u/Amareldys & u/RedFox_SF & u/mr8unty & u/thelilbinch

You all recommend that I try Ovaltamine (European version) and that it is different from the American version of Ovaltine. Well, you are 100% correctm it's less sweet. He has a slight malty flavor. I made a cup with water, and it was good.  I added 1/2 a spoonful to my coffee. ONG that was brilliant.  I agree that Ovaltamine is the superior product.

-------

u/Unicorn1982 & u/sweet_nasty_things & u/ndbrzl & u/paltrax

You all recommend Aromat. The night when amazon delivered it, I was having oxtail (cowtail) stew. I sprinkled some on a few bites.  It really enhanced the flavor. It reminds me of a seasoning I use called Everglade Seasoning. The next morning, i made over medium eggs for breakfast and sprinkled some on. It was GRRREAT!

------
u/Grand_Public_228

You recommend Caran D'Ache pen. I ordered a red one with a swiss flag. Let's talk about the clicking mechanism or the lack of click. It is buttery smooth. I mean, it's like silk. Barely an audible noise. The Swiss made the clicker so efficient. I am sorry, i hate it. I love super clicky pens. My wife hates when i have clicky pens. I will click a pen over and over. I will say i love the octagon sided aluminum body. It feels really nice. It's definitely a good pen. 

-----
u/Unicorn1982 
Offered to send me a Swiss care package and we have DM. I put together one for him. Ill post updates on this in future.  


-----
I purchased a SAK Midnite Manager. It is my first SAK that is only 58mm. This is tiny.  Its also my first SAK with a pen or light. I am excited sbout pen feature. I am going to put this on my keychain. We will.see if it survives EDC usage

### Training
Background:

M34
I‚Äôve been running marathons on and off since 2012, and this was my 8th marathon to date. My previous times are:

* 2012 - 3:45:35
* 2013 - 3:26:18
* 2014 - 3:34:46
* 2017 - 3:14:02
* 2019 - 2:58:09
* 2022 - 2:48:41
* 2024 - 3:08:48 (Boston)
* 2024 - 2:44:06

My goal at Boston earlier this year was to hit sub 2:45. Overly ambitious in hindsight, but I was certain I had the fitness to pull it off. My hamstring flared up a few weeks out during one of my last threshold sessions, and it was touch and go all the way up the gun. I thought it was an injury that I could power through, but alas, I was humbled within the first 8 miles. The pounding on the downhills in those first miles completely undid my left side, and I spent the next 18 miles battling for my life. I knew I was doing damage‚Ä¶but it was Boston and I had fought for so long to get there I WAS NOT going to DNF. I hobbled across the finish line at 3:08, twenty minutes slower than my PR, but ten times harder in effort. I felt proud of my ability to grit through the pain, but disappointed I was not able to prove my fitness to myself and others.

After Boston I did about 6 weeks of PT, and made a fairly speedy recovery. (Dry needling was a miracle for me). Fortunately I was able to do some decent mileage after about 3 weeks and so I didn‚Äôt lose much fitness in the process. I focused a lot on working strength routines into my training program going forward which became a huge help IMO.

The goal was to steadily and safely get back to a good volume. By mid May I was back in the 40‚Äôs, and pushing into 50+ by June. 

In July I ran a 17 second 5k PR (17:05) and was super happy with where my fitness was trending.  Hit 60mpw a few times in July, but the real training block began in August.

I jumped into Pfitz 12/70 program but modified it to 14 weeks. The reason being is I had a planned trip to Europe smack dab in the middle of the two peak weeks. I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to accomplish that while on vacation, so I started my program two weeks early, and just added two buffer weeks while I was away.  I managed to maintain decent mileage with a workout or two during those two weeks.

Overall, it was the most consistent block I‚Äôve ever had. I think I missed 1 total workout in 14 weeks and that was due to being tremendously hungover from Oktoberfest in Munich :)

Key workouts went well. I had a few blow ups in the heat where I didn‚Äôt scale my effort for the temps, but I didn‚Äôt let that get me down. MP efforts were all on point. My last workout was a 20 miler with 3x4m @ MP with one mile float. My MP miles averaged to about 6:08! It was at that point I was thinking that maybe 2:42 was achievable. I was unable to get in any real tune up races due to my schedule, but instead I ran a solo 10k time trial on a track 3 weeks out and hit a 35:20.

### Pre-race
Leading up to race day I did a 2 day carb load of 600+ grams. Usually I dread the carb load, but my appetite was ferocious and it went smooth with little discomfort. Pop Tarts and Red Bull were my friend.

RACE MORNING:

Woke up at 5AM. Breakfast was a bagel w/PB + honey, banana, coffee, and half of a Maurten 320 mix. My hotel was 2 blocks from the start corral so I chilled inside pooping in my room until about 30 minutes before the gun. 30 min before I took a Maurten Caf100, 500mg Tylenol, and headed out the door.

### Race

I had a lot more pacing issues in the first 5 miles than expected. I could not find 6:15 for the life of me. My first 5k was slow at 19:50 (6:23/m), but I tried to stay calm knowing I had a long race ahead to chip away at my time.

Miles 6-12 I really settled in and hit a groove. Felt super comfortable, had decent packs to run with, and felt I had plenty of energy to start picking up the pace. Confidence was through the roof. I was going to hit sub 2:45 no problem.

Hit halfway at 1:22:21 and had a mild panic attack. ‚ÄúOh boy, you can‚Äôt go any slower than this if you want to get sub 2:45. But I reminded myself that my first 5k was slow, and that I still had a lot of opportunity to pick up the pace and bank some time.

Miles 15-18 had some good downhills that I really tried to hammer. Dropped a 6:10/avg 5k here which was my fastest 5k split in the whole race.

18 on was a GRIND. Suddenly I was on an island, and the headwinds had picked up. I could feel myself straining against the slightest headwind, and I think it had a profound effect on my mental. I kept telling myself ‚Äújust get to mile 20 and then see what you‚Äôre made of‚Äù I was fully prepared to open up and rip the last 10k.

My legs were dead in the last 10k. I was still straining in headwinds wondering where everyone around me went. Finally, I got passed by a taller runner than me (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3) who was also quite built‚Ä¶and I just slotted in right behind him. I stared at the back of this dudes head and drafted off him for probably 2 miles. Eventually I surged past him and kicked solo for the last two miles. Getting back into downtown, the crowds thickened, and I had a surge of adrenaline take my stumpy legs to the finish line.

For fueling I had 50ish grams of drink mix in bottle, Gel 100‚Äôs at 4, 8(caf), 12, 15 (caf), 18, and 21  Water at about 4 of the stops, and Nuun at mile 23.

### Post-race

I‚Äôm super proud of this race and for getting redemption after my poor showing at Boston. Looking back, I think I could have gone 1 minute faster if I paced my first 5k better and didn‚Äôt deal with so much wind and solo running. My stretch goal was sub 2:42, but I think sub 2:43 was doable.

Not sure what my plan is going forward. I know I‚Äôd like to run New York (which I will likely do next fall) and probably Berlin after that. I can see stacking some more blocks and getting under 2:40‚Ä¶maybe into the mid 2:30‚Äôs‚Ä¶who knows?

I have recently ventured into the world of exchanging postcards via Postcrossing, and while it has been super fun and fulfilling, I would love to find a buddy with whom I can exchange letters (and maybe even goodies!) on a regular basis. I am 34/F and located in EST. I would love to write to someone within the United States to save on postage costs, but I'm certainly not opposed to international friends!

A little bit more about me: I am in a happy relationship with my partner of nearly 9 years. Together, we own a senior chihuahua (she will be 14 in January), so I would love to exchange photos of our pups! 

I love to read. Historically, I've been a fiction reader but more recently, I've begun dabbling in non-fiction. I think it all started after I read Cultish by Amanda Montell and realized reading non-fiction didn't have to be a slog.

I love listening to music and I'd say my tastes vary pretty widely. A quick shuffle of my Spotify yielded the following:

New Woman ft. Rosalia by Lisa
Got Me Started by Troye Sivan
Heads Will Roll by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs
Roman Holiday by Every Time I Die

In the standby queue for Revenge of The Mummy, there's a small chamber between the first & second ""dig site"" rooms. This chamber includes the key hologram, a tall fence/wall, and a big wooden arch with lanterns on it. It has a high arched ceiling and lots of bright paintings. I have a memory of it being a different queue configuration in the past, but the room's shape has always been the same

The room always feels...weird to me. It's too narrow to effectively host two lines of guests in a serpentine, and the entrance/exit wouldn't support that anyway. You might be able to route the line back and forth width-wise, but it's only a few people wide and I'd think that would be really uncomfortable too. The fence & arch aren't particularly themed or aged to match the rest of the queue, and for a ride building with such an immersive & creative layout the space they take up feels totally wasted.

Can anyone tell me what the deal is with this space and its features? Is it a structural thing? A reference to the movies or to Egyptian mythology I'm failing to place? Part of an old refurb or line re-route to support Express lanes elsewhere? Every time I walk through, I wonder what the deal is and then forget about asking while I'm clapping for another great cup of coffee, lol. Help! ",8,1731550191.0,UniversalOrlando,1,1.0,False

(need help)","So according to a dietician I'm seeing at the recommendation of my doctor, to help lose weight I need more protein in my diet--particularly at breakfast time. This is a bit of a struggle for me because I don't like standard breakfast meats (sausage/bacon), and with my IBS I can't do a lot of eggs or yogurt (so I might have eggs on Monday, but then I ought to wait until Thursday before I potentially have more or the tummy gets unhappy; same with yogurt, sadly). I thought about trying a protein shake, or protein powder made into a shake, but I'm running into the same roadblock and that's the ingredients.

See, with my IBS I also cannot have the fake sweeteners. So no sucralose, no acesulfame potassium, no Truvia, etc. On top of that though, my IBS does not handle Stevia or Monk Fruit well--both cause tummy upsets and *massive* cotton mouth for me. And it seems like every single protein powder and/or shake has one, if not two of these ingredients.

Does anyone know of one that doesn't? 'Cause I'm grasping at straws here to try and do better for myself, and it's honestly very disheartening to not be able to find something that doesn't contain these ingredients.

Also, just as an aside because I feel like someone mentioned this to me before, I cannot do mushroom coffee--I am allergic to mushrooms. I know they're a great source of protein, but my dad passed on faulty genetics (I got the IBS from him, too). üôÉ",1,1731549833.0,Protein,1,1.0,False

1gqu17f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gqu17f,Hotel Toranomon Hills wrap review,"Just wrapped up 3 nights at HTH, a few differences in from my last stay in June. 

Was upgraded to Deluxe Corner Suite King, City View. This had a *great* view of the Tokyo Tower from the living and bedroom. (pics below, I posted these earlier in the week, but were taken down by mods for lack of context)

Couple of differences from my stay in June.

Breakfast is now in the main Le Pristine restaurant, behind the front desk. Previously it was in the cafe which is next to the open bar area. I preferred the more open and bright space of the cafe last time, but the food is basically the same. As with many hotels the coffee is very slow - you need to ask for it and it seems like they are just running one espresso machine. For the life of me I don't understand why hotels don't brew pots of coffee anymore. 

The gym on 13 is still the same subpar/sad gym. One bench and a set of dumbbells up to 24kg. Couple of bikes, couple of treadmills. It's just a duplex suite with the equipment thrown in. It's 24hrs

The 5th floor is now open with a connection to the outside shops. There is a very nice full service gym ala Equinox or Pure (for my APAC based readers!) I read about this on Flyertalk. I mentioned it to the front desk at check in and was told ""this is normally chargeable, but as you are a Globalist we can give you comp access"". I got a card with a QR and my room number for the gym called Carappo. 

Big problem for me: the gym only opens at 7am. I need to be in the gym at sharp so I can be done by 7am, shower, breakfast and get to work. For others without an early schedule, this gym looks great. Highly suggest asking at check in (and if you care to, throw in a slight feedback that the gym inside the hotel is so poor!)

Otherwise the stay is excellent - upgraded rooms here are wonderful, very intuitive. You will need a two prongged American/Japanese plug or USB for the bedside - there are only a few universal plugs in the room usually near the desk/table in my case. 

As many have said the connectivity is great - subway stop accessible by going down two levels via escalator. I've migrated over here from the Hyatt Centric as I prefer the room and views, and never really liked the whole sink-in-the-middle of the room thing there. ",12,1731549715.0,hyatt,6,1.0,False

I always go there whenever I need to buy something. And lagi ko siyang nadadaanan papuntang school and pauwi. Then, there's this guy working there - which I didn't even realize na he worked there or baka kasi I only remember the faces of those people behind the counter, and siguro iba rin kasi yung role niya which I mistakenly thought for a customer lang. Pero one time, nakita ko siya na nasa counter as a substitute. And ayon hindi ko pa siya naabutan doon. >:(

Grabe, the first time I saw him, my eyes were glued to him. He's soooooo cute, definitely my type! Idk, maybe same age kami or mas older siya nang unti. Ang baby face eh. Anyway, I seldomly buy there, mostly tuwing may upcoming exams lang ako napunta doon to buy cold coffees. Pero parang mejo napapadalas na ata punta ko üòÇ, even if I don't need the coffee, napapabili ako just for the sake of seeing him. And now I have a bunch of cold coffees stockpiled in my fridge.

That's how my routine started. Before going to school, I always check if he's there, and tuwing uwian, I always make sure that before the day ends, I at least get a glance of him. Eventually, he finally noticed that I kept staring at him. Maybe he found it weird na, but bro pinapaalala ko naman sa sarili ko na wag masyadong magpahalata. Lol

Nung napansin niya na nga, doon na siya laging natingin sa akin. Not because type niya ko, but to make sure na tama yung hinala niya na natingin ako sa kaniya. There was this one time I was in the store, looking for something sa 1st aisle, dumaan siya doon. Pota, nahiya ako so umalis ako nung dadaan siya. hahahah So lumipat ako sa dulong aisle. Pwmesto rin siya doon, tapos biglang may inayos, sa tabi ko. Wala naman aayusin kasi ang organized na naman lahat. 

Another time, naglalakad ako papuntang school, napansin ko may lalaki sa malayo na nakatayo na nakatingin sa akin, potek siya pala yon. Nagpapahangin. Since wala akong alternative na daan, no choice kundi daanan siya. Habang naglalakad ako papalapit sa kaniya, nakatingin lang talaga siya hanggang malagpasan ko siya. Hindi ako makatingin nang maayos sa kaniya. Hahahaha

Just sharing my moments with my crush. Maybe I'm just overthinking these things kasi I've been single since birth. Wala lang, nakakakilig lang on my part.",4,1731549581.0,phlgbt,1,0.83,False

Our first 2 dates were coffee and sunsets. Third was breakfast. All nice but I didn‚Äôt feel like I missed him after. We both aren‚Äôt big texters and confirmed that we are looking for a LTR. We did talk about love and for him he said it‚Äôs always an instant feeling. For me it‚Äôs not and it takes time.

 like we have the banter of coworkers but with sexual chemistry but I mean when you‚Äôre in your 20‚Äôs that‚Äôs not really rare if the other person is good looking and their love language is also physical touch. 

There was also this strange thing where I got him some snacks because I just thought of him while I was out and gifts is one of my love languages. Like if I see anything and it reminds me of anyone I‚Äôll buy it for them regardless if they‚Äôre friends or family. I really didn‚Äôt think much of it but he really made a point that even though it was nice, gifts don‚Äôt do anything for him and he doesn‚Äôt like to give gifts either. He kind of went on a rant like it triggered him a bit. 

I was going to ask him on a 4th date but make it an activity because i think it‚Äôs a fun way to get to know someone and how they think. Maybe like a museum or a workout class. I‚Äôm not sure if I should though? Should I just let this go and move on to the next if he ends up ghosting? He‚Äôs nice but when do you know when something is not worth pursuing?

[Metro entrance](https://preview.redd.it/9jn425fjvr0e1.jpg?width=4192&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be96db8ea95f40f3a9c8a37b0447d9ce6ba57f00)

We visited Paris for an all-too-brief trip in the second half of October, our first time visiting since September 2021. We largely were going to visit some friends who moved there in January 2023, so we didn't have much of a tourist agenda planned. The weather was beautiful and sunny for most of our trip, and we really lucked out. 

We took a daytime flight from JFK to CDG, which was fantastic (but unfortunately discontinued a few days afterwards.) It really helped minimize jet lag. We'd booked an apartment on [Booking.com](http://Booking.com) near our friends' place in the 17th near Porte Maillot, but a couple days before our arrival it turned out the owner said it wasn't available and that Booking had made the reservation in error somehow. We were able to get our money back and got another place, a small studio with an even better location, on AirBnb for a few euros less. It was nice to have our own space and some kitchen facilities. G7 taxi from CDG to our destination was very easy to book on the app, though it was a bit more than I'd expected - I think ‚Ç¨62 plus a couple more for a tip, rather than the ‚Ç¨56 flat rate from CDG to the Right Bank. (was that because I booked it in the G7 app rather than going through the taxi queue?)

After a good night's sleep, we woke up slowly on a beautiful Tuesday morning. I went to a Carrefour Express for some cheese and yogurt, and a nearby bakery for croissants and a baguette tradition. After breakfast (so nice to have coffee facilities there!), we headed out to the Catacombs (got a Navigo Easy card and t+ tickets for each of us, not wanting to mess around with the apps too much in case of any technical issue) for our 12:00 ticket - the only thing my partner had said she wanted to see. It was very interesting and well done.

We walked all around from there, to a nearby [sewing/knitting store](https://www.atelierdelacreation.com/magasins/6-latelier-paris) on the Rue des Plantes where she picked up some crochet supplies and yarn, and then stumbled into a really neat [store that specializes in monastic-made products](https://www.artisanatmonastique.com/content/12-la-boutique-de-paris) from all over Europe - everything from Trappist ales to liqueurs, jams and chocolate, to lace, apparel (including religious vestments!), Nativity scenes, and other crafts.

From there we headed up the Boul'Mich' and headed over to a [fancy coffee place](https://www.artisanatmonastique.com/content/12-la-boutique-de-paris) for fancy coffee - very slow but delicious. After that we [shopped for zines](https://librairieunregardmoderne.com/) and walked down the way-too-touristy Rue de la Huchette to [Shakespeare & Company](https://www.shakespeareandcompany.com/), where I wanted to pick up a copy of a friend's book. (Tip: you can skip the immense lines outside if you're there for an event or if you've purchased something online and want to pick it up; just show proof to the person at the door and you're in.) It was an interesting bookstore, if overrun, and the staff seemed to be over the hordes.

We then headed back home via Ch√¢telet, and had dinner around the corner at the wonderful, neighborhoody, and very reasonable [Le Paris 17](https://www.restaurant-paris17.fr/) on Rue Guersant. We had oeufs mayo to start, then the specials - red tuna for me, pork ""filet mignon"" for her.

Wednesday morning we stopped again for croissants and fresh orange juice before meeting our friends and hanging out with them. We then went with them and their four-year-old to Parc Monceau to hit the playground there, taking the Rue Poncelet and strolling through [its very nice market](https://francetoday.com/culture/shopping-boutiques/rue-poncelet-and-its-fine-open-air-market/) en route.

Thursday took us to Neuilly-sur-Seine where we had a late lunch outdoors at [Breizh Cafe](https://www.breizhcafe.com/neuilly) \- oysters, galettes, good Breton cider, and cr√™pes with Bordier butter. We tamped that down with a walk over to the [Jardin d'Acclimatation](https://www.jardindacclimatation.fr/en), a kid's amusement park in the Bois de Boulogne where we checked out the [carousel](https://www.jardindacclimatation.fr/en/attractions/le-grand-carrousel), the Day of the Dead-themed activities (face painting, mariachi performances), a [roller coaster](https://www.jardindacclimatation.fr/en/attractions/les-souris-mecaniques), and [model ships](https://www.jardindacclimatation.fr/en/attractions/les-canots-du-lac) that you can pilot around the lake.

I started to come down with a cold, so we visited a pharmacy (and picked up some beauty products for American friends), and had a quiet raclette dinner. 

Friday the kid was in ""fun school"" day camp, so after picking up some pastry from [The French Bastards](https://thefrenchbastards.fr/fr) \- best of the trip! we headed over to the Marais. We poked around [S√∏strene Grene](https://sostrenegrene.com/fr/magasins/rue-de-rivoli-paris-s-4050), a [good bookstore](https://www.lamouetterieuseparis.com/) with lots of cards and posters and souvenirs, and around the Place des Vosges before going to the (expensive, kinda bonkers) [Merci](https://merci-merci.com/collections/toutes-les-nouveautes/?utm_source=GMB&utm_medium=organic) and then picking up the most amazing p√¢tes de fruits at [Jacques Genin](https://jacquesgenin.fr/magasins), my favorite gift from Paris.

#**01.Q: I want to buy a 1990-2005 Miata. What should I look out for?**


**A:** The most serious issue will be rust. Mechanical problems can be fixed by replacing parts. It is pretty easy to perform mechanical repairs on a Miata, but rust can condemn a vehicle due to how labor-intensive and prohibitively expensive it is to repair. A proper repair involves cutting out the corrosion, welding new steel in, blending with filler, then painting. Unfortunately, Miatas rust from the inside out. Any rust you see on the exterior will be twice as bad underneath the panel. Corrosion is most commonly found at the rear wheel arches, rear quarter panels, and rocker panels. Look under the wheel arch and behind the rear wheels.¬†

You should also be cautious of radiators with discolored plastic upper tanks. As the plastic tanks age, they become brittle and susceptible to failing with the engine running, leaving you stranded. The upper tank should be black. A tell-tale sign of imminent failure is if the tank has turned a faded brown or green color. These radiators are commonly referred to as time bombs by the community.

Miatas like to leak oil at high mileage. The valve cover gasket, CAS, cam seals are the usual suspects, but easy and cheap to replace. It is also common for the rear main seal to leak. A leaky rear main will be indicative of oil dripping out the bottom of the transmission bell housing weep hole. This seal requires separating the engine from the transmission and removing the flywheel. The part is cheap, but the labor is not. It can be relatively expensive to replace.

Be wary of purchasing someone else's clapped out project. It's typically not a good idea to buy a car on Raceland coilovers, mismatched body panels, missing interior carpet, catless straight piped exhaust, and katana handle shift knob -- especially if you are new to cars.

Check the sidewalls of the tires for a 4-digit date code. The first two digits reflect the week of manufacture, the last two digits reflect the year of manufacture. For example, a date code of ""2517"" means the tires were produced on the 25th week of the year 2017. You should know tires older than 5 or 6 years are junk.¬†


#**02.Q: I just bought a 1990-2005 Miata! What should I do to it first?**


**A:** Congratulations! Welcome to the ~~cult!~~ club! You should catch up on maintenance if maintenance history is unknown. Baseline the car. This means changing all the fluids. It‚Äôs a good idea to flush the clutch fluid and brake fluid. Replace the radiator if it needs one. Motor mounts are probably worn out. Inspect the timing belt for cracks or excessive wear. The controls of your +20 y/o car might feel sloppy. The throttle cable slack can be tightened up. Clutch pedal free play can be adjusted. The shifter bushings probably need to be replaced. The wheel alignment might be out of spec. Tire pressure might need to be adjusted. Tightening up your controls and catching up on maintenance will help make the car feel like it just rolled out of the factory. 

Look into cleaning out your rain rails and water drain tubes for the convertible top. If they get clogged it can cause water to leak into the interior and/or accelerate corrosion of the chassis from the inside out. Drain tubes are located behind the seats near the seat belts. The common tool used to clean them of debris is a trombone cleaner.

Tires are critical to the performance and safety of any vehicle. If your tired are in really bad shape, it's best that you prioritize replacing them.


#**03.Q: What does NA, NB, NC, ND mean?**


**A:** This is the chassis code which distinguishes each generation. It shows up in each VIN as the 4th and 5th digit. Keep in mind NA's and NB's are built on the same chassis and share a lot of parts. They are essentially the same car.

NA 1990-1997

NB 1998-2005

NC 2006-2015

ND 2016+

Outside of the US, they are also referred to as Mk1, Mk2, Mk3, Mk4.

#**04.Q: I'm tall. Will I fit in a Miata?**

**A:** People who are 6'3"", ~210lbs report fitting snug in NAs, NBs, and NCs,. The NB and ND are a little more cramped for a taller person. The NA and NC are supposed to be the roomiest Miatas for someone big/tall sitting in the driver's seat. The best way to see if you'd fit for yourself is to sit in one. Visiting your local Cars and Coffee is a great way to meet some friendly Miata owners who'd let you sit in their car.

There are also ""tall people mods"" you can do to help you fit better. You can remove the driver's door armrest of an NA and the foam can be cut out of the lower seat cushion to allow you to sit about an inch or two lower in the car. This is commonly referred to as a ""foamectomy."" 

Moving the steering wheel closer to your chest will give you more room for your legs. You can replace the steering wheel with a deep-dish wheel to prevent your knees from hitting it. Switching to an aftermarket wheel usually requires you to sacrifice your airbag. There are aftermarket steering wheel spacers for the factory wheel that will let you retain the stock wheel, and functionality of the airbag.


#**05.Q: Is an NA/NB a good first car?**


**A:** These cars are very fun, and very good roadsters. But, a roadster is inherently impractical. Early Miatas lack safety features. The interior is noisy and cramped. It only has enough room for one additional passenger and a few backpacks in the trunk. (visit r/miatalogistics to see some cool shit though.) 

Despite the Miata's reputation for being overall very reliable, NA's and NB's are old cars. Old cars do not make for the best first cars if you are not prepared to maintain or fix them. If you can't afford to pay someone for maintenance and repairs, you'll need some place to work on the car, you'll need tools, and you might need some help from friends if you're new to wrenching. Secondhand Miata parts are also getting a little more expensive each year, so maintenance and repair costs associated with replacing parts will steadily increase. If you can afford to buy and maintain what is essentially now a classic car to be your first car, then more power to you.


#**06.Q: How can I convince my parents to get a Miata as my first car?**


**A:** Scare them by pretending that you actually want a motorcycle. Once you get them angry enough, pretend to settle for something with four wheels. Offer to ""compromise"" on a Miata. /s


#**07.Q: How much does it cost to insure a Miata?**


**A:** Insurance coverage and cost is completely different depending on the individual and locale. No one can give you an accurate number except the insurance company. Call them or visit their website to get a quote.


#**08.Q: Is *this* Miata a good price?**


**A:** Please visit the dedicated sticky thread posted to the top of the subreddit for discussion about Miata prices. We'll be happy to give advice on good deals or talk shit about insane listings you find on Facebook Marketplace.


#**09.Q: Can I install popup headlights on my NB/NC/ND?**


**A:** Realistically speaking, no. However, Miatas are so popular to modify that it has been done before. It would require a ton of money or experience with body work.


#**10.Q: Is my oil pressure too low/too high?**


**A:** Usually, no. Oil pressure will fluctuate depending on engine speed and engine temperature. 1990-1995 Miatas have a somewhat accurate oil pressure sending unit, and it shows these fluctuations in pressure. Your owner's manual will tell you where the normal operating range is. Generally speaking, oil pressure should show at least 30psi above 3000 RPM, and increase 10psi per 1000 RPM. As long as the needle isn't showing zero pressure when idling, it's good. After 1995, oil pressure gauges turned into dummy gauges, or dummy lights. The dummy gauge is based off a true/false condition on whether there is sufficient oil pressure or not.


#**11.Q: What's that noise? My NA is ticking, mostly at idle.**


**A:** NA's have hydraulic lifters. Hydraulic lifter tick is noisy but harmless. These valve lifters are designed to be filled with pressurized oil. If your engine oil pressure is low, the quality of your oil is poor/worn, or the oil passages within the lifters are clogged due to contamination, your lifters will not be filled with pressurized oil. This will result in a ticking noise when the camshaft lobes press down on the lifters. The issue with noisy lifters can sometimes be remedied with an oil change, or switching to a slightly heavier weight oil. (Many NA owners have had good luck with Shell Rotella ""Brotella"" T6 5W-40.) If a fresh oil change doesn't work, you can try running an engine flush product through the motor to help clean it out. If it is still noisy, you may have to manually clean the lifters by removing and disassembling each one.


NB‚Äôs do not have hydraulic lifters. They have solid lifters and shims. If you suspect lifter tick, you‚Äôll have to check valve lash with a feeler gauge. Intake lash is specified at 0.008‚Äù - 0.009‚Äù. Exhaust lash is specified at 0.011‚Äù - 0.013‚Äù. If your lash is greater than specified, then you will have a noisy valvetrain and need to adjust it by replacing lifter shims.


#**12.Q: What's that clunking/knocking noise heard from lower in the engine bay? Knocking noise gets louder with engine revs**


**A:** Probable rod knock due to a failed rod bearing. Usually caused by poor engine oil maintenance, running the engine with low oil levels, or running for a long time with a lack of oil pressure. This issue will require an engine rebuild or engine replacement.


#**13.Q: What's that squeaking/rattle noise coming from behind the gauge cluster in my NA while I'm driving?**


**A:** NA's have a mechanical speedometer cable. If it's old and worn out, the cable will squeak when the car is moving. Replace the cable to fix the noise.


#**14.Q: What is that grinding noise on decel in my NA/NB?**


**A:** It is common to hear this noise after the transmission has been removed and reinstalled, such as after a clutch job. Check the procedure to perform a PPF alignment. If the PPF is misaligned when the transmission is put back in, you may hear a grinding noise under the vehicle when decelerating while in gear.¬†


#**15.Q: What size wheels and tires fit my NA/NB with good fitment? Do I need to roll my fenders?**


**A:** For balanced performance/street driving, the general consensus is that 15x7 and 15x8 wheels are a good choice when paired with 205 wide or 225 wide tires. Wider tires can handle more lateral grip as long as they are supported by an appropriate sized wheel width. Also note, the wider your tires are, the less comfortable it will be to drive. When buying wheels, educate yourself on wheel offset. Higher offset pushes the wheel inboard. Lower offset pushes the wheel outboard. Low offset often creates a concave, dished appearance to the wheel. Low offset has a higher chance of making the tires rub your fenders.

General reference for wheel and tire fitment:

-15x7 +35 offset, 195/50/15 fits all years of Miata with no fender rolling.

205/50 fits NB fenders with no fender rolling needed. Fits NA with 1.2 negative camber or better.

-15x8, +25 offset, 205/50 fits NB Miata fenders with 1.2 negative camber or better, NA Miata needs that camber and slightly rolled fenders.

225/45/15 needs fender roll for all years at this offset. Always check clearance during install and after the car is lowered to the ground.¬†


#**16.Q: My paint is faded, how can I fix it? Do I need a paint job?**


**A:** Many NA/NB Miatas (with non-metallic paints) left the factory with single stage paint. This means there is no clear coat. The paint can oxidize and become faded if it is not maintained by washing and waxing. You can polish the paint to restore the color and shine to look like new. Check out r/autodetailing for techniques and products that will help you perform exterior paint correction. If you have a clear coat, and the clear coat is failing, there is no proper way to fix this damage except for sanding down the damaged paint and getting a respray or vinyl wrap.


#**17.Q: What mods should I do to make more power?**


**A:** nitrous, turbocharger, supercharger, or engine swap. No, your K&N air intake and ISR muffler is not going to add 20 horsepower, even if it says so on the box.¬†


#**18.Q: What's the cheapest way to make more horsepower?**

¬†
**A:** Forced induction for these engines is so popular because it is the most cost-effective and reliable way to achieve a substantial increase in power. The Mazda B6/BP engine is tough. It is overbuilt, under-stressed, and benefits a lot from forced induction. For 99% of builds, you'll need a standalone ECU to boost the engine with a turbocharger or supercharger. Visit miataturbo.net and the miataturbo FAQ for build guidelines.


#**19.Q: I installed a cold air intake and a new exhaust system. Do I need a tune?**


**A:** NA/NB engines do not benefit much from bolt-on intakes and exhausts. You do not need a tune. It will not negatively affect the way the engine runs without a tune. NC's and ND's do respond very well to tuning with bolt-on mods.


#**20.Q: How do I tune my NA/NB?**


**A:** You cannot flash or alter the factory ECU programs in any practical way. You'll need to replace the factory ECU with an aftermarket, standalone ECU. A standalone ECU is its own little computer that plugs into the engine wiring harness. You will be able to connect the standalone to a laptop to run tuning programs. These programs will allow you to alter, adjust, or tune nearly every electronic parameter of the engine.


#**21.Q: What‚Äôs a coolant reroute? Do I need one for my car?**


**A:** The B6/BP engine was originally designed to fit in a FWD vehicle (The Mazda 323). When the BP was made to fit in the Miata, the engine was placed as close to the firewall/bulkhead as possible for proper weight distribution. This resulted in a lack of access to the back of the cylinder head, *where the thermostat is supposed to be.* Due to the lack of space near the firewall, Mazda moved the thermostat from the back of the cylinder head, to the front of the head. With the thermostat at the front, coolant flows from the radiator, into the front of the engine block, and exits where the thermostat sits at the front of the cylinder head. This is not ideal because coolant should flow into the front of the block and *exit out the back* of the cylinder head. With the way the coolant flows from the factory, the rear cylinders of the engine will typically run hotter than the front cylinders. 

A coolant reroute kit allows you to block off the thermostat neck at the front of the head and relocate the thermostat to the back of the engine. This reroutes the coolant to flow the ""correct way"" through the engine, so that all four cylinders operate at the same temperatures. A reroute is not necessary for a Miata that just serves the purpose of commuting and getting groceries. For high performance driving, sport, and track use, a coolant reroute is recommended along with a good quality all-aluminum radiator.


#**22.Q: How much boost/horsepower can a stock NA/NB handle?**

**A:** You can make as much power as you want by shoving enough oxygen and fuel into the combustion chambers. You should know boost pressure or horsepower is not an accurate way to measure the limits of certain parts. Torque is usually the force that breaks things, not horsepower. Why does this distinction matter? Because horsepower is equal to **(Torque √ó RPM)√∑5252**. For example, 150 ft/lbs of torque @ 3000 RPM is equal to 85HP but 150ft/lbs @ 7000 RPM is equal to 200HP. The biggest limiting factor of sending power to the wheels will be parts that are unable to support transferring X amount torque before breaking. Parts of the fuel system also need to be replaced in order to keep up with the amount of extra air flowing into the engine to prevent it from running lean. Some parts need to be replaced to allow the engine to rev higher.

The (rough estimate) general consensus on the limit of factory parts is:

Stock Part | Limit | Unit, hp/tq @ Wheels
:--|:--:|--:|
1.6 clutch | 150 | ft/lbs
1.8 clutch | 170 | ft/lbs
90-93 diff | 125-200 | ft/lbs
94+ diff | 400 | ft/lbs
1.6/1.8 con rods | 240, 7600 | ft/lbs, rpm
1.6/1.8 pistons | 300-350 | hp
1.6/1.8 crankshaft | 450+ | hp
5-spd trans | 250 | ft/lbs
6-spd trans | 300 | ft/lbs
6-spd w circlip mod | 370 | ft/lbs
oil pump | 350, 7500| hp, rpm
harmonic balancer | 300, 7600 | hp, rpm
valve springs/valve float | 7800 | rpm¬†
1.6 injectors | 140 @ 43 | hp @ fuel rail psi
1.8 injectors | 180 @ 43 | hp @ fuel rail psi
Fuel pump | 270 | hp
ECU | standalone required for tuning | ---


You can use this data to help plan your build. Say you want your 2001 1.8L Miata to make 200hp at the wheels. You only need to make a maximum of 150 ft/lbs at redline. You wouldn‚Äôt even need to replace the clutch to achieve your goal. The stock engine and drivetrain will be able to support a mild turbo or supercharger kit with a tuned standalone ECU and upgraded fuel injectors at this power level. 

However, it can be tricky to control how much torque the engine produces at redline because BP engines make peak torque at 4500 RPM, and peak horsepower at 6800-7100 RPM. A flat torque curve is the goal, but hard to achieve.

Here‚Äôs another example. Say you want your 1991 1.6L Miata to make 375 horsepower. You‚Äôll need the engine to produce a maximum of 280ft/lbs at redline. In order to support 280 ft\\lbs and 375hp you need to swap to a 6-speed transmission, 94+ differential, and upgrade essentially everything else listed on the table. Needless to say, you‚Äôll need a proper turbo and full 3‚Äù exhaust system to effectively achieve these power goals.

#**23.Q: How do I tune my NC/ND?**

**A:** You can flash tunes to the ECU after paying for a license to download and use tuning programs. Once you have downloaded this software to your laptop, you'll be able to use a Data Link cable to connect it to the OBD port in your car to flash tunes onto the ECU.

my roommate hates when i bring anyone at all over. my boyfriend comes over and stays at my place for 4 days every 2 or 3 weeks. he stays over for 4 dayas because he lives hours away and the train ride is very lengthy. My roommate has expressed how she isnt a fan of seeing him often before, so hes only ever showered here once (gross we know) and half the time hes here he sleeps at his parents. we eat out, are out of the house 80 percent if the time, dont cook or use any of the other spaces, hes never even sat on our couch before. i try my hardest to make sure they never cross paths, hes never spoken to her. we are very quiet both with sensitive ears, do not engage in sexual activity whatsoever in my home, and i text her every single time he comes over and when he leaves. when i text her she just says okay and has never objected.

a few days ago i had one of my female friends come over, again the same staying completely in my room unless using the washroom thing. we were gone most of the night, we drank a bit in my room and she fell asleep so she just stayed over that night. i admit i did not let her know about the sleepover part, but it was also 2 am and i was drunk. She texted me at 2 AM saying for me to make sure nobody stays over and she is not comfortable and for them to not use the washroom! i texted back saying sorry for not telling her and im sorry for making her uncomfortable, but i will continue to have my friends over because this is my space and i did not appreciate her saying who i could have over. i also said id try my best to be better at making sure she never sees anyone etc. 

after this, i saw her talking outside with the landlord, right after she walked away i spoke to her and she laughed and giggled so i assumed it was nothing about me. later that day i got a text from the landlord asking me whats going on with having my boyfriend stay over 'all the time'. i responded the situation i said above, how he lives super far, i text the roommate about it, hes only here every few weeks, etc. his response really shocked me because he said it is very innapropriate for me to have my boyfriend LIVE with me?? and that this is a female only residance and i agreed to that when i moved in (funny because we also agreed his family who lives above would not be very loud and on multiple occasions have been woken up by how loud they are and when i bring it up to him he says nothing i can do...its his loud stomping btw) and he said my boyfriend cannot sleep over any more. i responded saying that i understand the concerns, and that my boyfriend is NOT living here. i also said how both the roommate and the other home owner and i spoke prior to me moving in about my boyfriend coming over and they both said it was fine. i said that i understand my roommate being uncomfortable, but in my space i believe i have the right to have my boyfriend over. they never interact nontheless even see each other. i stated that i also think being uncomfortable with seeing people you dont know comes with having a roommate, i try to be as mindful as i can to my roommate by leaving as much ass possible and my boyfriend only sleep here and thats it. and its in MY space. his next few texts seemed very upset, that nothing 'comes with having a roommate' and that my boyfriend living here and using the utilites (told him he ONLY uses the toilet and DOES NOT live here) is making him 'lose interest in the unit' whatever that means. he said its innapropriate that any of my guests use shared spaces (LITERALLY JUST THE BATHROOM) and that he wants both tenants to enjoy their stay here and that its all fine as long as i do not make the other tenant uncomfortable and i do not make him lose his interest in the unit. my response was that she does not like to have people over, i do. it is very important to me to see my boyfriend, and he doesnt even come over very often and that i stated that previously and i felt as if he was taking my roommates word over mine. i said that i obviously do not want to make my roommate uncomfortable, but i dont understand how she has a problem if she NEVER has to see or interact with him. i also mentioned that written on my lease we both signed that he cannot enforce how many guests i have over and when.  i mentioned all the things i was willing to change, how i cant even have my boyfriend STEP FOOT inside the kitchen without the roommate complaining in what is ALSO MY HOME.  Everyone agreed i could have him over before, and the roommate has complained about EVERY person ive ever had over. even if we stay in my room the entire time. its been 3 days and he has not responded to me.

  
ON TO THE ROOMMATE OH BOOOYYY

i texted her asking to talk because i did not like having to talk through the landlord. she said i have tried talking to you and you do not understand so of course i will go to the landlord (she has texted me saying hey i dont like your boyfriend over and i have responded with how i am willing to change ie how we got to the point of him  doing nothing but be in my bedroom, but i will continue to have him over in my own space and she does not answer after that) i apologized for making her uncomfortable and i will keep trying to make sure she never has to see anyone i bring over, that we are quiet, etc and how i understand she doesnt know him, but ive known him for years and he is quiet and timid and never would want to make her uncomfortable in any way. i added that living with others will not always be the easiest or the most comfortable for people, and that it is inevitable that our very different lifestyles may clash at some points, however i respect hers and i would like her to respect mine. i ended asking why it makes her upset that my boyfriend is over when she never even sees him. her response was that this space is for two people, not three and that i agreed to that when signing the lease. she said she wants to be able to wear whatever she wants without feeling uncomfortable and she feels it is a breach of privacy having him over. she said having people over in the day is fine but i cannot let them sleep over. she said she does not feel safe, and that i gaslit her that my boyfriend isnt living here whenever she talks about it????? of course i said my boyfriend is not living here, and how i am willing to accomadate her and i understand her concerns, but it is also my right to have people over when i would like to as, it is her space too, but also mine. i let her know when people come over and that i feel like im the only one wiling to make change or sacrifice literally anything. i said it is written in the lease that i can have people over whenever i want and that telling the landlord to tell me not to have people over is not appropriate espescially becasue it is illegal for him to do so. her response was that she disagrees that i can have people over whenever i want and that my boyfriend is here more than half the month (EIGHT DAYS!! MAX HAS EVER BEEN 11)  and that it is not written in the lease. she said that if we are not coming to a solution then she can contact the landlord again. of course i sent her every government document of the lease saying that it is illegal for the landlord to enforce not having guests over or limiting guests as well as the literal lease i signed. i said that i DO NOT want her to be uncomfottable but i also do not want to be uncomfortable. i am mentally ill and seeing him is very important to me and this is the only way i can. i do everything in my power to make her uncomfortable and yet she is still demanding even more. i said that there are many things she does that make me very uncomfortable (she does not flush toilet paper, either uses a reusable rag to wipe or throws the used toilet paper in our open garbage can, including when she wipes....there...) and hER RESPONSE to this was literally ""i will drop this topic here, and i do not think i have done things that make you uncomfortable. there are many things that you do that make me uncomfortable too. i dont have time for this. we will see how it goes""  and i finished saying i really hope she can try and see my side of the story becasue this entire time ive been seeing hers and i really wished shed understand that i would like to feel happy in my own home and that, after already giving up so much for her, simply just seeing my boyfriend sometiems is how. she has not responded in days and avoids me at home. 

  
first off, am i wrong to say my landlord is very unprofessional? he kept arguing things that i already discussed, said id change, or proved wrong as if he never even read what i said. he did not seem to believe me when i said the days my boyfriend was over, but instead believed her saying he is living here. he also did not seem to realize that this is not his place to dictate who comes and goes...hes had problems in the past about still calling this place HIS basement. it made me feel weird when he said the stuff about interest. it is literally illegal for him to tell me not to have guests over??? and i dont get how he cant see BOTH sides of this, that i am trying so hard to accomodate for my roommate and how she hasnt done anything at all. it feels like shes just demanding me to change and gets upset when i dont, as if shes the sole right and what im doing is wrong just becasue she doesnt like it. also oh my god when she said I DO NOT THINK I DO THINGS THAT MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE???? i nearly lost it dude. some how she has every right to be uncomfortable but the second i am??? cant be. nope. and her shutting up the second i sent her the proof of the lease stuff lolol. she also took the cardboard out EXCEPT FOR my one box. didnt even put hers in the recycling brah. 

like am i really just being a dick? she is 30 and indian so i can understad that maybe she has cultural/ relgious reasoning for being so uncomfortable around men, however therew as no where on the housing listing or the lease stating a single thing about religion.  i respect your beleifs, but do not expect me to believe them. if you want someone the same as you, meet someone the same as you and move in with them, do not move in with a stranger and be shocked that they are not your exact cup of tea. uugghh this has been so draining, ive been so anxious that ill get a text from the landlord saying im being evicted dude. i pay over 1k a month for just my bedroom, she pays a little less as hers is smaller. i already put up with so much and both of them attacking me for the ONE THING that makes this all bearable for me is making me feel awful. my friends have told me to move out but i still have months left on my lease. this has me questioning if maybe i am just a terrible person lol. some context btw, she works from home and literally NEEVVVERRRR leaves the house. i can count on one hand how many times ive been home alone. and i work full time and am gone about ten hours a day. i will admit, i am a little bit disorganized, not messy but like ill leave a paper on the coffee table or forget to empty the lint trap type thing. any mess i have is in my room. shes around 30 and i am 20. landlord is also about 30. let me know ur thoughts becasue mine are literally fried. fuuCK dude

1gqtnjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1gqtnjb/how_i_figured_out_my_cystic_acne_after_accutane/,How I figured out my cystic acne (+after accutane relapse),"Wanted to post this as I've had a crazy long journey with acne and I actually feel like I finally understand (95% of) it now and also barely have any acne anymore. I'm willing to my triggers also affect lots of people, despite my dermatologist repeatedly telling me they are not triggers.

**1) History (feel free to skip, but might be applicable to you)**

High school: light/moderate acne, kept under control with Benzaclin + Tretinoin

College p1 (Freshman/Sophomore year): Acne got way worse my sophomore year (as did my diet, which i'll talk about more below), both in frequency and severity. I tried doxy, it definitely did not work at all. My dad said his acne lasted until he was \~25, so I said screw it and went on accutane.¬†

College p2 (Junior/Senior year): Junior year I was pimple free from accutane, however my acne came back about 9 months after finishing accutane (summer after junior year). I went back on Benzaclin and tretinoin, and that pretty much cleared me up for all of senior year.

Age 22-23 (1 year post grad):¬† acne came back like CRAZY. Not as bad as pre accutane, but pretty bad. There were pretty much no small pimples, just deep, cystic, painful, red ones that would appear 2,3,4 times per week. Dermatologists had no answers, suggested I go on accutane again. Instead, I thought about what had changed in my life since college, the majority of which was my diet... which brings me to part 2).

23-Now: Maybe 1 or 2 pimples a month (can go months without them), which I now know how to manage. Still on benzaclin and 0.1 tretinoin to stay clear though.

**Part 2) Figuring out the solution (can skip this too, but might help you figure your shit out)**

What made me figure this all out was that the only thing I *really* changed since I was clear was trying to up my protein intake. It obviously wasn't protein itself (which does not cause acne), but I started eating protein bars every day (or some other type of bar like Kind/granola). I did some digging and assumed it was whey, and when I stopped eating the protein bars, I stopped getting pimples *immediately*. Not only that, the inflammation/redness of the existing acne went down, and they went away significantly faster. I then switched to vegan bars a few weeks after, and on came the same exact type of acne. I compared ingredients, and the only overlapping ingredient was sunflower lecithin.

I'm gonna skip all the in between, but once I started avoiding foods with sunflower/soy lecithin, my skin pretty much stayed clear.¬†

In hindsight, I bet my sophomore year acne got worse because my diet was so shitty.

**Part 3) Triggers**

1. As mentioned above, sunflower/soy lecithin is the NUMBER 1 that absolutely erupts my face with unpoppable volcanoes. They are red, never form a head, and extremely painful. I don't know if it's this specific ingredient, it could just be that its in every processed food/especially anything with chocolate. Also, it's okay if you have some one day in a row, its consistently having it that is a major issue. But I will say, it can be caused by as much as a mini chocolate bar. FYI - many of my friends who struggle with the same sort of acne have had this trigger as well. It's always in the same spots, cheeks and right below the bottom lip on the side. Fun fact: it appears in the same exact spots for them too, esp the lip...
2. Through the same process as above, I discovered daily consumption of dairy is a trigger as well. It causes more light/moderate acne, but definitely contributes to inflammation. A bunch of dairy one day won't do anything, but a little bit every day will (i.e. a few bites of ice cream, milk in coffee, etc.)
3. Whey protein. Even though both whey and plant products were causing my acne, when I switched back to whey with the lecithin it still gave me acne so I just avoid it alltogether. I found a plant based protein mix without lecithin that works great.

**4) Managing Consumption**

1. If my dumbass somehow combines 2 of the above triggers, its like 1+1=100... it's so much worse than what one causes alone. DO NOT COMBINE THEM. If I eat dairy a few days in a row, I make sure to strictly avoid anything with lecithin. If I have some sort of treat that I know has it, i avoid dairy for a few days in a row. Just keep the overall *consistency* of consuming each to a minimum
2. If I do get a pimple, I immediately stop consuming anything that triggers it. It makes the pimple heal and go away much, much faster

**5) Managing live pimples**

Fortunately though this process I've discovered how to get pimples to go away fast. When mismanaging them before, they would last like 2 weeks. Now, the same type of red, cystic, no head pimple can go away/be rather unnoticeable in just a few days. Also, no offense to anyone, but don't use any thing (vitamin C serum, tea tree oil, vinegar?? idk) other than what I mention below.

1. Don't fucking touch it. I don't care if you feel like you ""need to pop it"" to relieve it and that it won't go away any other way, thats not gonna help anything and it will increase the redness, scarring, and duration. The only time you should pop a pimple is if you ever so lightly press into it with 2 fingers and it releases on its own. When you do that, do not go futher than when it stops. You need to avoid drawing blood to not cause scarring.
2. USE AQUAPHOR. This is the key. As soon as you see a pimple appear/form, put aquaphor on it for 30-60 minute spans a few times per day until any evidence of the pimple is gone. Moisture is all your skin needs to speed up the healing process. This also helps with redness going away faster too. I say 30-60 minutes because I think technically aquaphor can clog pores (although it never has for me) so on live pimples you just want them moisturized AF and to give the pore the ability to clear out. I will say though, once the pimple is gone and it's just redness, I put it on before bed and the redness significantly decreases overnight, so maybe just see what works for you.
3. Put benzoyl peroxide on it 2-3 times per day (morning/lunch/evening) along with moisturizer each time. Space this out with the aquaphor, because aquaphor will trap anything with it into the skin and cause excess irritation. Just make sure you don't use aquaphor within 30 minutes of BP.

Sorry this turned into a novel, but I'm hoping I can rescue someone else as there was absolutely nothing on the internet that was similar to my situation, and once I told my friends and they did the same their acne cleared up as well.

Hi everyone! So basically I've had a major crush on someone at work for months now. We've talked here and there but recently I worked up the courage to slip a piece of paper into a book he had borrowed me, asking to go to coffee. (I'm super shy)
Fast forwards to this week
We went out for coffee 2 days ago and had a brief chat where I told him my birthday was the next day. The next day he wished me a happy birthday over text, and basically said: ""sure we could hang out again for coffee and we'd 
see eachother at events and the workplace ;)""
- when I said thanks for the coffee and if he ever wanted to catch up again
( Wink included) 

........


Now my question is ... with all these signs : wouldn't he know by now that I like him? 

I'm not sure if he's just.... messing with me or genuinely doesn't understand that I want to get to know him... he's also the rather serious/shy type.

I'm not sure if to approach him at events as he's always talking to others... and idk if he shouldn't rather do the approaching


Please help... I'm afraid of spelling it out to him
PS. We're both in our upper 20s

Just updated from 12.5.4.2. Speed profiles seem nice, in theory‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm still pressing on the accelerator every time I pass an increased speed limit‚Ä¶especially if under 50mph. FSD is perfectly content doing 32 in a 55 and that is problematic.

I imagine speed issues from city streets are now also speed issues on the freeway with the new end to end.

I‚Äôm getting abrupt stops at both stop signs and red lights‚Ä¶almost like it doesn‚Äôt see them until it‚Äôs too late. This is new. Further, stop signs‚Ä¶boy does it like to take its time stopping and then going again. The wait after fully stopped seems to be longer and worse than 12.5.4.2.

Smoothness has DEFINITELY worsened from 12.5.4.2. I remember the ‚Äúcoffee cup test‚Äù Tesla used to help improve smoothness from 12.3+ ‚Ä¶that seems to be thrown out the window now‚Ä¶it‚Äôs taking turns like NASCAR‚Ä¶and accelerating the same way‚Ä¶under 50mph and on all speed profiles above.

The only improvement I have noticed, so far, is the car no longer does 39 in a 25 residential zone. 

Also what is up with the ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù 40% offset on highway?? At 70, max speed would be  98?!",3,1731547964.0,TeslaFSD,3,0.8,False

In 2019 I took a sabbatical year and travelled around Europe with my wife and 2 year old. We did a day in Liverpool to take in all things Beatles. 
First stop was the Yellow Submarine play area (for the kid) and then we drove and parked on a street by John Lennon‚Äôs house, which seemed too surreal. We didn‚Äôt go in, but got some pictures of the front. We then walked to Strawberry Fields and then back in the car to drive down Penny Lane (stopping at some spots). We then parked by the pier, saw and got some awesome pics of the Beatles statue and did a Beatles Museum. We then went to The Cavern Club (where we were met with the sweet sounds of someone covering ‚ÄòLet if Be‚Äô). I got a coffee mug as a souvenir (my favourite mug). It was such a fantastic day and i‚Äôm happy my wife and daughter willingly partook in my Beatles self guided tour and enjoyed my giddiness.

Kinda wish I'd spent a little more on charisma, if I'm being honest.  

Anyway, I just finished my master's degree and am finally where I want to be with my career.  I've been privileged to find a good job, have a strong and healthy relationship, and good health.  Like many of us here in this group, I didn't prioritize maintaining independent friendships on my journey and find myself with lots of time to finally work on that now that I've achieved all that I set out to do.  

I'm looking to make some age-appropriate friends of any gender reasonably near me (CT, RI, MA) to build a friendship with over time.  Like many married folks, we have some ""couples"" friends that we hang out with as a unit, but no ""me"" friends that I can do independent activities with which is what I'm seeking.  I'm ultimately looking for IRL friends that I can make plans with even if those plans are just coffee and laughs or a museum visit.

I'm a former drama club nerd and president of the radio club.  Not a big sports fan.  If you've ever been to a Neil deGrasse Tyson show AND seen Rage Against the Machine you'd probably get my personality.  Sarcastic but not mean, I respect people and their imperfections but have little tolerance for selfishness or misogyny.  I'll bend over backwards to help a friend or stranger but hold a grudge for life.  I work in adult education and love what I do.  

I collect hobbies like your grandma collects Hummel figures; I garden, read, weld, DIY, raise chickens, sew, and tons of other stuff.  I enjoy learning for learning's sake because it makes me a more well-rounded person.  I've always sucked at art (music, instruments, dance, drawing, etc.) so I'm really thinking about taking guitar lessons or something to fill that gap in my life.  Any suggestions for  artsy hobbies are appreciated!

So if you're more ""The Big Orange Splot"" and ""Go the Fuck to Sleep"" and less ""A Child's First Bible"", hit me up and let's see if we vibe.  Introduce yourself and let me know what is your favorite holiday and why?

Date and time: 12/11/24 6am GMT

Location: Middleton, Derbyshire, United Kingdom 

I woke up and went outside with a coffee early at 6am while it was still dark. Upon looking up I noticed a bright yellow light in the sky about 400 meters away from me. It was silent as you can tell. The object was slowly rising vertical with no deviation whatsoever. There is a plane below the object but some distance off, that wasn't close enough to hear. As I was filming the object it was rising up further, still silent in sound. As I zoom back out you can faintly see a light on the object flash then it just disappears in front of my eyes and camera lense. 

What I find most peculiar is the fact it was so so bright and had a set path of flight, vertical. It was also silent in it's flight. Note the airplane approaching later in the video is the first sound besides my breathing. Then the disappearance of the UFO in plain sight is weird too.

Before this job, I was a hospice nurse which I had to quit because the driving had become too risky. I enjoyed being a hospice nurse, but I did not enjoy the long drives and the risk of being in a car accident or even getting a ticket. 


I work at a skilled/rehab nursing facility. We usually get the patient coming from the hospital that requires rehab or just a little longer monitoring after they‚Äôve been hospitalized. Currently at this job I work at night from 7 PM to 7 AM. Now the job is not hard currently, but it can become really hard and stressful. The bad thing about this job is that I‚Äôve been working on the second floor where I have one CNA and there is 17 to 20 patients with just us to working. They‚Äôve only put another CNA making it 2 CNA‚Äôs upstairs working with me when I had informed that the workload for only one CNA and one nurse for that many patients is unacceptable and unfair. It‚Äôs unfair to us workers and to the patients. We are all suffering because less help means longer wait times for help. Now staffing has been inconsistent. Were there won‚Äôt be two CNA‚Äôs and it‚Äôs a terrible time. Now before this happened, we didn‚Äôt have that many patients and yet it was still not the best place to work just because management wasn‚Äôt supportive. Never recognize anyone for good work or hard work. They would have things for the dayshift like donuts, coffees, Panera, etc., but never for the Night Shift. We used to have when I first started a shift manager, but now that we have a higher census, we do not have that. 

I know what most of you guys are gonna say that it‚Äôs like that everywhere which I know it is. Cause I‚Äôve been looking for a new job. Places arealways under staff and you will never find the perfect place to work as a nurse.

That‚Äôs why right now I‚Äôm debating on quitting or just reducing my shifts at work currently until I found another job. I‚Äôve been looking for nursing jobs and no nursing jobs currently.  Just wondering if I should quit prior to fighting a new job and take a break. 

I also started taking an antidepressant medication because of this job. Which is currently not helping much because it takes some time before the medication works. I wished maybe I started this medicine earlier, but I wanted to see if things would get better, but things changed for the worst. ",1,1731546724.0,nursing,2,1.0,False

1gqsyp3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gqsyp3,Hotel Toranomon Hills wrap,"Just wrapped up 3 nights at HTH, a few differences in from my last stay in June. 

Was upgraded to Deluxe Corner Suite King, City View. This had a *great* view of the Tokyo Tower from the living and bedroom. (pics below, I posted these earlier in the week, but were taken down by mods for lack of context)

Couple of differences from my stay in June.

Breakfast is now in the main Le Pristine restaurant, behind the front desk. Previously it was in the cafe which is next to the open bar area. I preferred the more open and bright space of the cafe last time, but the food is basically the same. As with many hotels the coffee is very slow - you need to ask for it and it seems like they are just running one espresso machine. For the life of me I don't understand why hotels don't brew pots of coffee anymore. 

The gym on 13 is still the same subpar/sad gym. One bench and a set of dumbbells up to 24kg. Couple of bikes, couple of treadmills. It's just a duplex suite with the equipment thrown in. It's 24hrs

The 5th floor is now open with a connection to the outside shops. There is a very nice full service gym ala Equinox or Pure (for my APAC based readers!) I read about this on Flyertalk. I mentioned it to the front desk at check in and was told ""this is normally chargeable, but as you are a Globalist we can give you comp access"". I got a card with a QR and my room number for the gym called Carappo. 

Big problem for me: the gym only opens at 7am. I need to be in the gym at sharp so I can be done by 7am, shower, breakfast and get to work. For others without an early schedule, this gym looks great. Highly suggest asking at check in (and if you care to, throw in a slight feedback that the gym inside the hotel is so poor!)

Otherwise the stay is excellent - upgraded rooms here are wonderful, very intuitive. You will need a two prongged American/Japanese plug or USB for the bedside - there are only a few universal plugs in the room usually near the desk/table in my case. 

As many have said the connectivity is great - subway stop accessible by going down two levels via escalator. I've migrated over here from the Hyatt Centric as I prefer the room and views, and never really liked the whole sink-in-the-middle of the room thing there.

1gqstb8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gqstb8,Bioextracts Native Extract,"Hi all,

Just a review for Bioextracts Native extract. 

I have wanted to try this one for a while given the high mesembrine content however I was reluctant due to the relatively low potency (2.8%) given the price is the same as their zen at 7%. However presumably due to the ""other alkaloids"" there seems to be a kind of entourage effect as the extract feels similar in potency to the full spectrum, at 5%.

How does it feel? The high mesembrine content makes this extract very stimulating and as such it would make a great coffee or nicotine replacement, or a substitute for amphetamines for example. Music enchancement is very notable. Colours look brighter. If you're looking for an MDMA like extract (disclaimer - kanna is not a hard drug and will never hit like one) his one may be for you. The mood boost is nice and clean and not overpowering. Very functional extract.

This extract feels notably dopaminergic and much less serotoninergic than a lower mesembrine extract..

Another added 'feature' of this extract is how vasodilating it seems to be - much like the full spectrum.

As a final note this extract insufflated has to be the best feeling one in the nose. No discomfort at all.

Cassandra, volatile with rage, tossed her husband‚Äôs cell phone to the floor of their bedroom, intending for the device to clatter and crash melodramatically when it connected with the wood tile. It landed screen-up and spun towards Tom‚Äôs feet, gliding smoothly against the ground like an air hockey puck. He hastily bent over to stop his phone‚Äôs forward motion, pocketing it without looking at the screen. Tom already knew what pictures would be opened on his messaging app. Instead, he went silent and did not argue, turning his head away from her and submissively placing his hands in the air. The motion was meant to represent a white flag of surrender, but more than that, it was a way of admitting guilt without asking for forgiveness.¬†

Wordlessly, he pushed past his wife to grab a pillow from his side of the bed and then paced quickly out of the room. Tom turned right as he exited, carefully stepping over a few unopened moving boxes to make his way to their new home‚Äôs staircase. With a sound like rolling thunder, he stomped and pounded each foot against every step on his way up. Every petulant boom reverberated and echoed in Cassandra‚Äôs mind. When Tom reached the attic, he bellowed something that was clearly meant to be a defamatory finale to his boyish tantrum, but she couldn‚Äôt make out exactly what he said from where she still stood motionless in the bedroom. At that moment, any lingering regret about dosing her husband for the first time that morning with the Curandero‚Äôs poison evaporated from her, remorse made steam by the molten heat of her seething anger.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm an animal, you‚Äôre a goddamned blood-sucking leech, Cassandra!‚Äù*¬†

Tom‚Äôs retreat from his wife had been both unanticipated and expeditious. To that end, he could not think of a retort to her jab until he was three steps out of the bedroom, but he held onto the retort until he reached the safety of the attic‚Äôs doorframe. He knew he could belt out his meager insult from that distance without fear of an additional counteroffensive. As soon as the words spilled from his mouth, he tumbled past the threshold into the attic and slammed the door behind him.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt his fault Shiela was swooning over him, Tom smugly mused. She had volunteered those digital pinups of her own volition. That said, he had been actively flirting with the young secretary since the couple landed in Texas two months ago. Their marriage had been in a death spiral for years, in no small part due to Tom‚Äôs cyclical infidelity. The cross-country move had been a last-ditch attempt at resuscitating their relationship, but of course, Maine was never the problem to begin with, so the change of scenery mended nothing. In his middle age, Tom felt a gnawing desire to feel warm-blooded and virile. Cassandra‚Äôs despondency had the exact opposite effect. She made him feel undesired - sexually anemic. That night was not the first time he had called her a ‚Äúblood-sucking leech‚Äù for that very reason. However, if Tom had been gifted the power of retrospection, he may have noticed that his wife‚Äôs frigid disposition became the norm after the discovery of his second affair, not after his first.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúI want something that will make him feel even a small fraction of the insanity he‚Äôs put me through‚Äù*

Cassandra whispered to the Curandero, visually scanning the entire antique store for possible interlopers or undercover police officers before she asked the purveyor of hexes standing behind the counter for anything definitive and incriminating. Multiple family members had recommended this unassuming shop on the outskirts of downtown Austin for an answer to Tom‚Äôs beastliness. The apothecary grinned and asked her to wait a moment, turning to enter a backroom concealed by a red silk curtain. The witch doctor was not what Cassandra expected - she couldn‚Äôt have been older than thirty, and she certainly did not present herself like a practitioner of black magic. No cataracts, scars or gemstone necklaces - instead, she sported an oversized gray turtleneck with part of a floral sundress peeking out from the bottom.¬†

She returned seconds later, tilted her body over the counter, and handed Cassandra a vial no bigger than a shot glass. Inside the vial were innumerable tiny blue crystals. They were slightly oblong and transparent, looking like the illegitimate children of rock candy and fishfood. The Curandero cheerily instructed Cassandra to give her husband the entire ampule‚Äôs contents over the course of about three days. As she left the store, the shopkeeper cryptically reassured Cassandra that her husband would be thoroughly educated on his wrongdoings by the loving kiss of retribution.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúWhy is it so fucking cold up here‚Äù*

Tom mumbled to himself, doing laps around the perimeter of his makeshift sleeping quarters in the attic. It had been approximately three weeks since their argument and his subsequent relocation. At first, he didn‚Äôt much mind it. The cold war between him and Cassandra was taxing, but he had his phone and Shiela‚Äôs escalating solicitations to keep him company. But as of the last few days, he had begun to feel progressively unwell - feverish and malaised. Then he noticed the small lump on the underside of his left wrist.¬†

It was about the size of a dime, skin-colored, immobile, and profoundly itchy. Tom felt like he spent almost every waking minute massaging the area. The irritation then became accompanied by white-hot burning pain, gradually extending up his arm as the days passed. One night, as he scratched the area, the lump moved a centimeter closer to his palm. He paused to inspect the change, assuming the vexing cyst had finally been dislodged and neutralized. After a few seconds, however,¬† it moved again - but in the opposite direction and without Tom‚Äôs help. And then again, slightly further up his forearm. Revitalized by panic and confusion, he began clawing recklessly at the lump, until the skin broke and a small black button was liberated from the wound, only to scurry away to an unseen sanctuary. Tom thought the button looked and moved like a deer tick.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

*‚ÄúSure, Tom, come back down. But to the couch, for now, okay?‚Äù*

Cassandra had accepted many empty apologies from Tom before, but something about this most recent one felt slightly more sincere. By this point, she had completely forgotten about the Curandero and her vengeful prescription. Cassandra had gone through with slipping the contents into Tom‚Äôs coffee over the course of three days, but that was over a month ago. At the time, she did not really believe it was black magic - she assumed it was a military-grade laxative or some other, ultimately benign, poison.¬†

The more she thought about Tom‚Äôs behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn‚Äôt been drinking. When she looked into Tom‚Äôs eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals.¬†

She was at the Curandero‚Äôs shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom‚Äôs system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dyed salt, my love‚Äù*¬†the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra‚Äôs hand as a means to corroborate her claim.¬†*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration‚Äù*

Confused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

Tom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut.¬†

What had started as an infestation had become a plague.¬†

The gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem.¬†

Cassandra‚Äôs mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature‚Äôs abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police.¬†

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.¬†¬†

*‚ÄúDo you have any pets, dogs especially?‚Äù*¬†The doctor asked.¬†*‚ÄúWhere in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?‚Äù*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband‚Äôs odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault.¬†

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*‚ÄúThe dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What‚Äôs worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.*¬†

*Tom died from his airway spasms.*¬†

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.*¬†

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.*¬†

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That‚Äôs why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom‚Äôs blood saved your life‚Äù*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had.¬†

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.¬†

The more she thought about Tom‚Äôs behavior, however, she came to realize that she may have been mistaking a sincere apology for what was actually fear and need for comfort. Cassandra had not interacted much with Tom in the past few weeks, but now that she was, he was certainly acting off. Seemingly at random, he would slam his palm down on himself or something else in front of him and then would be unwilling to give an explanation. He slurred his words like a drunken sailor, but as far she could tell, he hadn‚Äôt been drinking. When she looked into Tom‚Äôs eyes to find that his pupils were rapidly dilating and constricting like black holes on the verge of collapse, the realization hit like a lightning strike up her spine. Cassandra remembered the vial with the blue crystals.¬†

She was at the Curandero‚Äôs shop within the hour, catching the witch doctor right as she was locking up her store. Cassandra pleaded with her for an antidote to whatever magic or venom was now in Tom‚Äôs system. In response, the shopkeeper produced another identical vial from her jacket pocket, twisted the cap off, and dropped a few of the crystals into her mouth:

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs dyed salt, my love‚Äù* the Curandero said, then pausing to tap out a few fragments onto the backside of Cassandra‚Äôs hand as a means to corroborate her claim. *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt sell power, just the idea of power. Whatever you made manifest, I only provided the inspiration‚Äù*

Confused and without clear direction, Cassandra returned home to check on her husband.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

Tom had never been thirstier in his entire life, but he could not drink. Every time he poured himself water, he carefully inspected it through the transparent glass, only to find it contaminated with hundreds of ticks - an entire galaxy of black stars drifting aimlessly through the liquid microcosm. Sitting at his kitchen table with his head in his hands, Tom cried out in agony, only to have his wail cut short by his vocal cords unexpectedly snapping shut.¬†

What had started as an infestation had become a plague.¬†

The gentle touch of a hand on his shoulder nearly scared him half to death, causing him to jump back off his chair and knock the infested glass off the table and onto the kitchen floor, shattering it instantly. He took a breath, seeing that it was only Cassandra, but that relief was short-lived when he looked back down to see an armada of nymphs moving on his position. He yelped and scrambled on top of a cabinet. His wife moved forward, seemingly to comfort him. When she held his hand, Cassandra noticed the open wound where that first tick had sprouted, and she rushed into the other room to procure bandages. For a moment, Tom felt safe. His wife began attending to his wound while he was still perched on the cabinet. But then he felt a pinch on his left wrist, followed by an intense lacerating sting, and then finally, the sensation of warm fluid gushing down his palm. When he looked down, his wife looked up at him in tandem.¬†

Cassandra‚Äôs mouth had mutated into a pulsating arena of hooked teeth, with plasma delicately dripping from the barbs she had just used to bite into him. In one swift motion, Tom pivoted his torso, unsheathed a blade from a nearby knife block, drove it deep into the creature‚Äôs abdomen, and sprinted out the house and into the street.¬†

‚Äî---------------------------

Cassandra nearly bled out on her kitchen floor, but a neighbor heard the commotion and had called the police.¬†

She awoke in the ICU surrounded by family. When she asked them what happened, they paused awkwardly and traded solemn expressions with each other instead of explaining. When Cassandra pressed for information, they flagged down her doctor from the hallway.

The physician did not mince words with Cassandra. Tom was dead - he had been picked up by the police fleeing the neighborhood but had been delivered to the same ICU she was currently in when he started to wheeze violently and turn blue.¬†¬†

*‚ÄúDo you have any pets, dogs especially?‚Äù* The doctor asked. *‚ÄúWhere in your house do you and your husband sleep? Have you ever seen any bats in your home?‚Äù*

Cassandra explained that they had bought their home recently, that Tom had been sleeping alone in their attic after a particularly nasty argument, and that she had seen a bat fly out a window once when they were moving in. She then detailed her husband‚Äôs odd behavior in the time leading up to her assault.¬†

The physician frowned and then elaborated on their suspicions:

*‚ÄúThe dilating pupils, the hallucinations, the fear of water, and the inspiratory spasms - they all suggest that your husband contracted rabies while living in your attic. Most of the time, people in the US contract the disease from a dog bite. However, bats are known to transmit the disease, too. What‚Äôs worse - if bats are in your home, they can bite you in your sleep without you waking up. If contracted, the disease is universally fatal, and there is no known treatment.*¬†

*Tom died from his airway spasms.*¬†

*You nearly died, too - from blood loss. Did you know you have an extremely rare blood type? AB negative. Only 1% of the population has this blood type, and unfortunately, the hospital has been critically low on replacement blood that is AB negative for almost a month now.*¬†

*We were initially very concerned - you needed more AB negative blood than we had, but as serendipity would have it, Tom was AB negative as well. Imagine that.*¬†

*Thankfully, rabies cannot be contracted through the blood - only through saliva. That‚Äôs why it is contracted through bites. Although it was unconventional, our administration gave us the green light to give you a large portion of his blood. In essence, Tom‚Äôs blood saved your life‚Äù*

The doctor paused, waiting patiently for whatever questions Cassandra had.¬†

But she had none. Instead, there was an eerie, uncomfortable silence for almost a minute.

Then, Cassandra tilted her head back, closed her eyes, wept, and had a very long laugh.¬†

This brew pours the darkest and with the heaviest body out of any root beer I've ever tried and that says a lot. You can taste the vanilla and honey but holy cow it's an absolute licorice bomb to finish. It's a really good root beer if you're into that, I enjoyed the first half and gave the rest to my son who loved it, not sure I could finish the whole thing. I recommend giving it a shot if you get the chance!

Best neighborhood for a someone in their late 20s (single) that wants to meet other young professionals?

My main priority is affordability (1br <$1.7k), walkability to coffee shop/grocery store/gym, and young professionals (22-35). People say uptown but when I visit it seems empty and dirty. I‚Äôve been told the Colony, which has a party reputation that I probably don‚Äôt want.

I liked Bishops Arts for the coffee shops and art galleries. I went to Oak Cliff Coffee then walked down from there, it was great but It‚Äôs far from where I work (Addison) and the crime is high. I‚Äôm visiting the Village, Lower Greenville, and the Design district this weekend. Hoping to hear some of your perspectives. ",1,1731545177.0,askdfw,13,0.55,False

This dog is incredibly spoiled and has a huge ego, I've completely fallen in love with this dog (becuase obviously, right? Ugh). 

Anyways, this dog is on a special diet, its like 4 raw meats in a fancy bowl with specific amounts of seeds and stuff sprinkled on top, theres a dried fish or a turkey neck or quail egg for garnish and stuff - its a whole thing to serve this dog dinner and honestly I'm enjoying it, I love cooking and its such a joy to be making dinner for this dog every night. 

Tonight as I was making his dinner I had some kind of messed up PTSD flashback and it totally threw me off. 

I was stuck in this miserable loop in my marriage when I was still stupid, before I woke up to reality. It was probably the ten thousandth time that I had spent 2 hours after work making some elaborate dinner for my ex, something he liked that I couldn't even eat a crumb of because I have crazy food sensitivites. He would come home, ignore my fucking existence, ignore the delicious smell of dinner and just crash on the couch or his PC. From his fucking desk job at work where he literally consults people for tech support. It wasn't even hard labour or anything but his performance would have made you think he was doing some insane phsyically exhausing labour like chopping wood or drilling oil the way he put on a show when he got home. 

And when I would stupidly make a plate for him with ganish and everything, and take it to him, he wouldn't even move his body to reach for it, I'd just have to put the plate in front of him on the coffee table or his desk and he would continue to play his video games or scroll his phone for as long as he wanted until the food got cold, and then eat half and then he would quietly throw the rest in the trash. 

Forget gratitude, I would have fucking died for simple acknowledgement during those days. 

So back to this dog, he comes and stands next to me in the kitchen the whole time I'm putting his dinner together. He's got the biggest eyes in anticipation, he's drooling and being so patient. I put his dish down and he barks a little bark of gratitude and excitement. Devours the whole thing like a tornado. Looks so satisfied, and wants to cuddle afterwards. 

I'll probably bring this up in therapy next week but holy shit. This dog is literally healing my divorce ptsd.
