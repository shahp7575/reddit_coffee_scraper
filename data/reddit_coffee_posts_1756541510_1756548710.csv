1n3xyks,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthPH/comments/1n3xyks/online_or_inperson_consultationtherapy/,online or in-person consultation/therapy?,"Hi, i need other insights to my dilemma. I had an initial in-person l consult with a psychiatrist last march 2025, ok naman si doc, warm and understanding, kaso mahal ang fee nya, 4k in 1 session, although with 20+ years of experience na din kasi sya.
then earlier this month i tried an online counseling session, mura lang sya, 500 for 1 hour, kaso in a coffee shop ako, so public space sya, kasi walang private and secure space sa bahay, and nagkatechnical problem kami, so nakaka-off sya.
(btw im wfh for more than 5 years now)

now im thinking of trying a different psychiatrist, but i cant decide between online or in-person consultation.
here are the pros and cons in my specific situation:

In-person consultation:
Pros
1. may mga malapit na psychiatrist clinics sakin
2. private and secure space
3. it will motivate me to go out para maiba naman environment ko for a change, since wfh nga ako
4. it will motivate me to meet and talk to an actual person for a change, since wfh nga ako

Cons
1. mahal ang fees ng malalapit sakin, around 3,500 to 5k per session
2. depends sa psychiatrist, clinic schedules are not that flexible


Online consultation
Pros
1. accessible to more psychiatrists with more affordable rates
2. accessible to more psychiatrists with more flexible schedule
3. accessible to more psychiatrists with specific specialties

Cons
1. mahirap maghanap ng private, quiet and secure space. i searched for co-working space and mahal din ang rates nila for meeting and conference rooms (minimum of 2k). crowded at maingay sa coffee shops pag weekends, which is my free time.
2. prone to technical difficulties/barriers
3. para lang akong nakikipagmeeting ulit, since i have been in a wfh setting for more than 5 yrs, i find it comforting and refreshing to talk and cry to someone in person about what i feel.


I value yung pagkakaroon ng private and secure space, also Im at a low point na parang ayoko na magtry ulit at parang nanghihinayang ako kay 1st doc kasi may history na ko sa kanya, kaya im having 2nd thoughts kung magtry pa ba ako ng iba.

1n3xsy9,https://i.redd.it/0at6buz4r4mf1.jpeg,32F4M Asian in AU: LF Ace partner or potential Lavender Marriage,"
Hi! I am someone who seeks ace relationship or/and potential lavender marriage. I don’t know why I keep on liking gay men only, maybe because I like their soft/kind personality, good hygiene and great humour. I already gave up on finding a straight man at this point, mainly due to my attraction preference so maybe a lavender relationship is what’s good for me. I am sex-indifferent but romance-desired. I wanted a partner so my two bestfriends and I (with you) can finally play doubles in table tennis/badminton plus an additional braincell for our escape room escapades. I had an acespace account before but idk why I cannot access it anymore now.

• I love travelling! I have been to Japan 5x, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan, Hongkong and US (California). Love trying local food, culture and exploring nature on these trips.

• I recently tried doing escape rooms (we didnt escape tho haha) and I love it! 

• Recently watched shows: Maid, Dept. Q, North Shore, Severance, Black Mirror (late to the party, I know!)

• I like doing puzzles and solving mysteries (l love BBC Sherlock Holmes series btw) and interested on doing sports as well (thinking of badminton or table tennis)

• Currently working multiple jobs so I am quite busy but I make sure to make time for people I connect with. I needed time to get to know the person before meeting them as I am very anxious and prone to overthinking when meeting someone for the first time (probably due to the nature of the things that I like to watch e.g., crimes and murder series) and I have a hard time trusting strangers.

• Due to a failed LDR, I am not considering LDR anymore but open to friendships and/or casual chatting about life and whatnots. I am not open to move country but might softly consider moving state (currently in Vic, Aus)

• I am female, 5’0, brown-skinned, around 60kg and trying to lose weight to 50kg. Dresses decently and have good hygiene.

Hobbies and Interest: Documentaries and Movies (Thriller/Psychological/Horror), Anime, Travelling, Nature trips, Food trip and coffee date/hangout, yapping (and I’d like to think I am a good listener too), I like deep conversations and talking about personal topics with regards to your life and experiences as a person.

Love Language: Quality Time, Gift-giving

Personality: Introvert, INFP

Educational Background: Bachelor degree graduate (STEM), Engineering

Pros: I am very caring to the people I love, I have multiple set of friends that you can be friends with as well (if you are keen to make new friends) or happy to stay at home and hangout and just watch something while eating. I am loyal, attentive and very understanding— I can be your very own friend therapist lol.

Cons: Very busy at times and take some time to reply. Takes some to trust. Blurred eyesight. Doesn’t know how to drive (but trying to learn now) I dont like talking to people who I feel like I am an interviewer: Me always intiating converstation or topings and when I ask questions they answer one-liners and dont ask anything back/doesnt open another topic.

Pitch yourself, your interests and let’s see where we go. I am open to friendships and potential relationship. We can exchange photos and details via DM. ☺️",1,1756548034.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False
1n3xs7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Keyspace_realestate/comments/1n3xs7u/why_dubais_new_neighborhoods_are_perfect_for/,Why Dubai’s New Neighborhoods Are Perfect for Walking and Living,"Dubai is often pictured as a city of skyscrapers, luxury shopping, and endless highways, but the city has been quietly evolving into something much more people-friendly. Over the last decade, urban planners and developers have placed increasing emphasis on walkability, lifestyle, and convenience. This shift has given rise to communities where residents can live, work, shop, and relax without relying solely on cars.

One of the best examples of this trend can be found in and around **Dubai Commerce City**, a rapidly developing hub that blends business opportunities with residential and recreational spaces. Much like how the **underrated places to visit in Abu Dhabi** reveal a more intimate side of the UAE, these pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods in Dubai show that city life can be just as enjoyable on foot as it is from behind the wheel.

# Exploring Pedestrian-Friendly Neighborhoods Near Dubai Commerce City

When people think of [**Dubai Commerce City**](https://keyspacedubai.com/dubai-commerce-city/), the first images that come to mind are modern offices, free zone companies, and international trade. Yet, just beyond the glass towers, there are welcoming communities designed with wide sidewalks, shaded streets, and green areas that encourage walking.

Imagine starting your day with a coffee at a local café, strolling through **Green Park Dubai**, and arriving at your office in minutes. This is the lifestyle many residents enjoy: seamless access to work, leisure, and daily necessities without battling constant traffic. These neighborhoods prove that convenience and livability can go hand in hand.

# Why Walkability Matters in Dubai

For years, Dubai’s reputation was tied to car-dependent living. Driving was the default way to get anywhere, whether it was a short trip to the store or a daily commute. Now, a growing number of residents are rethinking this lifestyle and choosing neighborhoods where they can walk to shops, schools, and restaurants.

Near Dubai Commerce City, developers have invested heavily in infrastructure that supports walking and cycling. Safe pedestrian crossings, bike lanes, and connections to public transport make it easy to leave the car behind.

This is especially valuable for professionals working with **free zone companies in Dubai**, who benefit from shorter commutes and more time to spend on personal activities. After a workday, they can relax with friends at **City Social Dubai**, a trendy spot known for its vibrant atmosphere, or take the family for an outing at **Dubai Parks and Resort**, all without long drives across town.

# Communities That Combine Lifestyle and Location

What makes these neighborhoods stand out is how they integrate everyday living into one space. Apartments are often built above or next to supermarkets, gyms, and bakeries, so errands can be handled with a short walk instead of a drive.

Families, in particular, appreciate the proximity to **Dubai Parks and Resort**, which has become more than just a tourist attraction. Local residents use it as a weekend escape, enjoying rollercoasters, water parks, live entertainment, and seasonal events. For quieter moments, **Green Park Dubai** provides wide lawns, jogging paths, and shaded seating where families gather for picnics or evening walks.

The mix of convenience and lifestyle means that these areas are not only attractive to current residents but also highly desirable for property investors.

# Better Quality of Life

Living in walkable communities does more than save time; it also improves overall well-being. Fewer cars mean reduced traffic and cleaner air. Green spaces provide natural cooling and shade, making walking feasible even in warmer months.

For professionals tied to free zone companies, the ability to manage work, family, and leisure within the same area creates a healthier balance. Instead of losing hours each day to commuting, residents can enjoy lunch breaks in nearby parks, attend fitness classes after work, and still be home early for dinner.

# A Social Way of Living

Walkable neighborhoods also foster stronger community ties. The design naturally encourages social interaction. You are more likely to bump into neighbors on your way to the store, chat with parents while children play in the park, or strike up a conversation at **City Social Dubai** that turns into a lasting friendship.

For children, these communities provide a sense of independence and safety. They can walk to school, playgrounds, or friends’ houses without always needing to be chauffeured by parents.

# Weekends Without Driving

One of the biggest advantages of living in these communities is the freedom to enjoy weekends without relying on a car. A typical Saturday could start with breakfast at a neighborhood bakery, continue with a family trip to **Dubai Parks and Resort**, and end with dinner at a cozy restaurant within walking distance.

[dubai commerce city](https://preview.redd.it/76daew5o04mf1.jpg?width=1224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=63ac0571a5d33cae88a6ee758b1f21731798de66)

Because **Dubai Commerce City** is well-connected to the wider city through public transport, residents can also reach beaches, cultural districts, or shopping centers with minimal travel. The result is a lifestyle that feels less rushed and more fulfilling.

# Balancing Work and Leisure

For professionals working with **free zone companies in Dubai**, living near Dubai Commerce City offers the perfect combination of efficiency and lifestyle. They can walk to the office, unwind in **Green Park Dubai**, and enjoy evenings out at places like **City Social Dubai**, all within the same neighborhood.

This balance is one of the key reasons why these areas are attracting property investors. Buyers are increasingly interested in homes located in walkable, mixed-use communities because they deliver long-term value, both as residences and as rental properties.

# The Future of Walkable Living in Dubai

Dubai has already proven that it can build world-class skyscrapers and iconic landmarks. Now, the focus is shifting toward creating spaces where people can thrive on a daily basis. The neighborhoods around Dubai Commerce City demonstrate this vision clearly: they combine modern apartments, cultural venues, parks, and entertainment in a way that supports sustainable, enjoyable living.

For those considering a move or investment, the area offers a unique blend of convenience, lifestyle, and growth potential. From evenings at **City Social Dubai** to weekends at **Dubai Parks and Resort**, or quiet strolls through **Green Park Dubai**, these communities redefine what it means to live in Dubai.

1n3xs1u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3xs1u,AIO my friend cancelled on me last minute again,"So just a bit of background history. We’ve been friend for nearly 10 years. Last year one of their family members made them homeless so they came to live with me in my one bedroom flat with their 3 cats. Since they moved out they didn’t really speak to me anymore and only called me when they wanted or needed something from me. This became obvious because I started to cut down my contact to see if they’d bother to message me at all. 

A couple weeks back I was moving into my new place once they returned from their holiday (as I was cat sitting for them). They knew I was moving and offered to help me move some things the following day. I only asked if they could help me move a small coffee table and they volunteered to help with everything else. I clearly stated that I understand they would probably be tired from travelling but not to agree to something if they’re gonna cancel on me last minute because it’s happened so many times already and it gets me irritated because it messes up my day. They promised this wasn’t the case but turns out it was. Am I wrong for reacting the way I did? 

I want to also add that this has happened to me before where I’ve cancelled plans to make time for them and then they cancel at the very last minute, after giving me updates of when they’re setting off. The autism diagnosis was only given a few months ago but since then every excuse given is followed by ‘but I’m autistic’. Again I’m not discriminating or anything but before then there were no excuses being made so it partially makes me feel like they’re just not bothered. 

And with the whole America thing, they wanted me to live in their house so I could pay their rent and bills and look after their cats whilst they were abroad which they didn’t ask me, it was more of a demand. 

My other friends who know more about this stated they feel like they’re just using me now because they can but I wanted an outsiders opinion. ",1,1756547945.0,AIO,3,1.0,False

I’ve noticed on tv and in movies Americans refer to having ‘cream’ in their coffee. I’m so confused about what this means and I don’t know why, but I just think about it often and really want to know the answer. I asked my American family once, and they could’nt really explain what they mean, they were just as confused with me not understanding. 
We use milk in coffee in my country. Either Skim (low fat) or Full Cream (full fat) milk. It’s frothed using steam to create lattes or cappuccino. Or warmed for flat whites. Or people have no milk, and just have black coffee. 
So, what does it mean, in America, when people ask “do you want cream” in your coffee? Do they mean milk, or cream? If it’s cream, like the dessert kind that you whip, I’m assuming it can’t be frothed then? To us, “cream” is different to milk. Cream is whipped, it’s what you top a scone with or serve with desserts. It’s not put in coffee. Is ‘cream’ something different in America? Or do you literally put cream in coffee. Or is it a word for something else?
Yes, I know this is a ridiculous thing to get so interested in, but I really really want to know.

So looking at other espresso machines, which do not have a large footprint, many without pressure gauges is sad. 

I mentioned this first world problem to my mate yesterday and he suggested the idea of adding a Gravity analogue water sensor to the solenoid value to then broadcast the pressure value to a raspberry Pi and small screen to see the pressure during extraction - https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1675.html

It works, it sounds as it should and heats up nicely - but the water doesn’t come through either the group head, hot water tap or steam wand. If you push the single shot or double shot button it makes all the right noises but the water never passes, and just ends up in the tray. I tried just holding the cup button for rinsing and once it actually managed to steam from group head with a little water dripping as well. 

If you use steam wand it hiccups like it’s struggling a bit. I’ve tried running descaling solution through all day but no luck so far. I’ve opened the top, but the backplate is tough getting off - and everything looks fine, one spot a little chaulky.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Each week we typically get a mix of regulars, people who drop by occasionally and a few newbies.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg)). The bar staff also know who we are if you're not sure.

There's an optional Whatsapp group for the meetup -it's pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. 
If you really do want to join it just ask around at the meetup.

She told me that even if we get back together, she ain’t gonna forget that I dumped her and it’s gonna be toxic. She told me that she hopes I find someone more forgiving and loving. 

On the 4th day, I felt a lot more positive. Grabbed a cup of coffee at a nearby cafe in the morning. I went for a job interview which went well. Went to buy groceries in the evening and then played some games with a friend. 

Today, which is the 5th day, I made the mistake of checking her Instagram and Tiktok account. That made me miss her.

It’s nothing fancy, but it’s quiet and kind of feels like a routine that keeps me sane.

A couple of months ago, a new barista started working there. The first time she took my order, she misspelled my name on the cup. She caught it before I even noticed and said, *“Sorry, I’ll get it right next time.”*

Since then, she’s remembered my order every time I walk in. Sometimes she adds a doodle on the cup, a tiny smiley face, a little heart, once it was a cat that honestly looked more like a potato, but it made me laugh.

I didn’t think much of it at first, but over time it became the part of my morning I looked forward to. I’d be half-asleep walking in, but leave smiling because of some little thing she did.

One morning, it was pouring rain, and I showed up soaked because I forgot my umbrella. She handed me my drink, then slid a dry napkin across the counter and said, *“Coffee’s on me today. You look like you need a win.”*

That was kind of the moment it clicked for me.

Last week, I finally left her a note on the back of my receipt. It just said, *“Thanks for always making my mornings better. Would you want to grab a coffee sometime? (One you don’t have to make).”*

The next morning, she handed me my drink with my name spelled perfectly on the cup… and underneath it she’d written: *“Yes.”*

We’ve gone out twice since then. Nothing huge, just coffee and talking. But it feels… good. Natural. I don’t know where it’s going, but I’m glad I finally asked.",13,1756546296.0,story,1,1.0,False
1n3xcpr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n3xcpr,I promised myself I wouldn't...and yet I did.,"I started experimenting with espresso and coffee in general in the early 2000s, with a Carimali semi-automatic, as part of a coffee shop I started. Learned the fundamentals of espresso back then, took a few courses, and closed the coffee shop as I had different paths to pursue in life. After many years of drinking subpar coffee shop coffee around the world, I treated myself to a DeLonghi Super Automatic. That was not the best of moves, but I committed and tried to make it work for a few years. Those coffees were pretty terrible, burnt, black, and bitter. I would call those my dark days. I posted it for sale here, and someone bought it nearly right away, offering me a good deal that included a Flair Pro 2 and some cash. I took it, had to buy a hand grinder (I got the J-Max), and got cracking. I had finally found myself really getting into the nuances of great coffee after so many years. The thermal management was a PITA, though, and I liked double shots, which proved to be possible, but they were also time-consuming and annoying. I decided I wanted the Flair 58. So I got that. A lovely piece of kit, I dove deeper into espresso and found it both forgiving and a part of my morning meditations. The process was a delight. However, the J-Max was proving to be a handful as I preferred lighter to medium roasts, and even with the hand drill, I found it rather jolting every morning to fight that tool. So fine, treated myself to an Eureka Mignon Oro Single Dose Grinder. That grinder is all I need moving forward for espresso. And so time went on till I noticed the Lelit Bianca V3 in gold and began lusting after it. It provided the flow control I needed, allowing me to replicate lever shots while offering a faster workflow. It also features a dual boiler and rotary pump, essentially making it a complete home espresso machine that, for now at least, does not require any further upgrades. I hope. I am using the MHW3-Bomber tools, including their Pro WDT, which is a joy to use. The tools include their auto-leveller, impact tamper, blind shaker, and a subminimal coffee dosing scale. All gorgeously machined pieces of engineering art. The only issue I faced was that the tools are not compatible with the portafilter that came with my Lelit Bianca V3; however, they are compatible with the portafilter that came with my Flair 58, so I am simply using that one for now.

I now have a selection of second-hand kit available for sale here to those interested.

This includes the Flair 58, a Brevista gooseneck kettle, two J-Max hand grinders: one in like-new condition and one with a dent that prevents it from working with the hand lever, requiring the use of a portable hand drill instead. I also have a variety of accessories, such as shot mirrors, etc. I should make a separate post with pictures of all those and their prices, though. How should I price the Flair 58, Brevista kettle and the J-Max, which is in nearly new condition?

Thank you for taking the time to read about my journey. I should be done for a while now till I get my hands on an LM Leva X.

Be for others the person I always needed, but never had.

Dust off my skint knees and soothe my dry throat with steaming coffee.  Shrug off a brain trained well to wake early for toil and watch the fog roll beneath the luminous tangle of reds, lavenders, and golds cradling a rising Sun.  Mesmerizing memorizations of insects revealing their identities in the gardens I allowed nature to re-wild.  Spittlebugs, Tumbling Flower Beetles, and Stilt Bugs.  Painted Ladies, Pearl Crescent, and Horace's Duskwing Butterflies.  Sandwasps and Eastern-Tailed Blues.  Long-legged flies, ladybugs and spiders of many iterations.  Southeastern blueberry, honey, longhorned, leafcutter, sweat, and digger bees.

Small new moments where the code clicks and the formula works.  The last coat of paint.  Night walks and standing in the mercy of the rain.  Pushing my last iota of energy to go the extra step and make tasty food into a labor of love...something beautiful meant to be given away.  Donning a mask to hide from any credit for the packages I pass out.  Needs that run the spans of warmth, cooling, health, and hygiene.  Care without words.  Culminations to my introverted relief.  A vicarious replacement for the embrace I crave.

Reclaiming the sullied memories and showing myself that I can control my reality.  Subjecting myself to the whim of woodland isolation and revere how nature keeps my huberous humbled.  Surrender to the lessons in found loneliness.  Waiting eagerly on the first and fourth days of the week.  Treasuring the routine of his soothing voice acknowledging me.  Admiring the wit that accompanies his earthy eyes meeting mine.

Nothing is mine, and everything is potential.  Pain paved a path to endurance...and my tears do not fall for trivial reasons.  Wash and scrub away the past defilements and step forward to absorb a warmer world not clinical, unsterile, and vivid in color.  Light the crackle of wood wick candles sweet with salted vanilla and linen...feel the fire spark in my ocean eyes.  If I have to walk alone in order to save myself, then so be it.

Hold on to any good thing I can get.

There is something that i truly wish I forget even though i know never will  , last year on my birthday I went on a vacation with my family , we are a family of just 3 people or atleast were , me , my dad and my mom . We booked an Airbnb in a cabin in the woods ( I don't remember where it was because I was tired as hell and we were in a hurry too) . When we got there , it seemed like the most peaceful place I've ever been to . We went in the bnb , there were some weird paintings hung on the wall which looked kinda off but I was really sleepy so i just ignored it , I went to the bathroom , took a dump and then went to sleep , next day when I woke up I saw 3 black cats sitting in front of me right at the end of the bed , staring at me , I scared them away but they just walked off , then i told my mom about it , she was acting really funny , ""probably dad left the backdoor open when he went hiking up early in the morning"" said my mom and brushed it off, i thought ""meh maybe he didn't wanna wake me up that's why he didn't take me hiking with him  "". As time kept passing  , he didn't come back , it went from morning to evening but he still wasn't back , it wasn't a big deal dad had been to without telling us before I said to my mom .But after a few more hours passed, I said "" Mom dial 911"" but she didn't , I shouted "" MOM DIAL THE FUCKING NUMBER"" she told me she didn't wanna make such a big scenario out of it and assured me that he's gonna be okay . My mom who worked for the forensics , called 2 of her friends ( they were cops off duty)   , it was already dark when her friends got here  , those guys were giants , one of them was a 6'7 blonde , he jokingly said "" one of you didn't put him out did you "" , my mom replied "" that was not funny joseph"" , they were good friends with my dad . We left the cabin ( except my mom ) , and started searching for him , I was with the blonde  and the other guy went seperate way , which was really stupid , there was barely any  network in the woods so we talked through walkie talkies , I shouted "" DAD?"" ""DAD"" but there was no sound except the sound of owls , we tried we really did but there were no results , tired we went back to the cabin , Then the basement outside caught my eyes , "" What if he's in there"" I said to the blonde , ""It's locked kiddo , zero chances "" he said .

Bahrain’s 2025 Business Landscape: Strong Growth & New Regulation\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting with Manama cityscape., Bahrain’s GDP is projected to grow by 4.1% in 2025, buoyed by fintech, logistics, and strong government backing of foreign entrepreneurs. The Economic Development Board (EDB) recently opened the North Manama Business Hub, streamlining digital registration and approvals via the Sijilat system. Forbes Business featured Bahrain in their 2025 “Top Small Markets for Agile Startups” due to the country’s 99% foreign ownership policy and regionally low company setup costs.\
But with these opportunities come regulatory changes. A new 2025 policy, implemented on March 15th, requires all free zone companies trading locally to register a dual-purpose Commercial Registration (CR) and appoint a VAT representative—no more “backdoor” trading on a free zone-only license. (The first wave of businesses I helped adapt to this new rule found it surprisingly simple, but only if you knew the right lobby desk at MOICT to avoid the lunch-hour queues.)\
Free Zone Company Formation in Bahrain: Rules & Realities\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain company formation.).*\
Free Zones: What They Offer (and Don’t)\
Bahrain offers several “free zones” (technically, logistics and business parks with special regimes):\
\
Bahrain Logistics Zone (BLZ)\
Bahrain International Investment Park (BIIP)\
Bahrain International Airport Free Zone\
\
Each provides 100% foreign ownership, customs benefits, and simpler labor processes (details here). But, and this is important: free zone licenses are designed for export-oriented business. The original intention was clear—facilitate international trade and global service delivery, not direct local sales.\
\
“Many founders assume a free zone CR lets you open retail or service outlets everywhere in Manama. That’s a common misunderstanding.”\
(I’ve seen more than a few founders shocked in Sijilat registration queues when asked for a local sponsor or dual CR—don’t be that entrepreneur.)\
\
Can Free Zone Companies Trade Locally?\
Short answer: Free zone companies cannot automatically do business with the local Bahrain market. Your CR restricts you to certain activities and locations—unless you take extra steps.\
How it works in practice:\
\
To sell or supply products/services to the Bahrain market (outside your free zone), you must either:\
Appoint a licensed local distributor or agent\
Open a local branch or obtain a dual-purpose CR\
Convert to a mainland company structure, if desired (see ownership options and 99% foreign ownership guide)\
\
\
\
I once had a client miss out on a lucrative logistics contract because their CR stated “BLZ Only” under “activity location.” We pivoted fast—forming a dedicated local branch, prepping new bank documents before Ramadan hour changes hit government offices.\
Insider tip: The best approach is to plan your entity structure with both export and local trade in mind from Day 1. Don’t rely on “workarounds” like ad hoc distribution; regulators are tightening checks in 2025, especially on VAT compliance and invoice tracing.\
Read the details on company formation process in Bahrain for free zone and mainland options.\
\
2025: Regulatory Change You Must Know\
Bahrain’s March 2025 update to the Sijilat system now requires all free zone firms wishing to trade locally to:\
\
Register a dual-purpose Commercial Registration (CR)\
Meet local office requirements (physical or serviced office)\
Appoint a registered VAT representative\
Obtain approvals from MOICT and the relevant Free Zone Authority\
\
Implementation date: March 15, 2025\
Who is affected: All free zone companies seeking direct local trade or e-commerce sales in Bahrain.\
Surprisingly, this actually made things easier for well-advised companies. Now, there’s a simple checklist and no ambiguity—if you follow the right steps in order. (I personally found the MOICT e-queue system now works best at 10:15am, just after the first morning rush and before most locals break for coffee.)\
\
Practical Example: Navigating Local Trade as a Free Zone Firm\
A US-based SaaS startup wanted to sell cloud ERP to Bahraini retailers. They:\
\
Formed a company in the Bahrain Logistics Zone (BLZ).\
Pre-signed a partnership with a local IT firm as authorized reseller.\
Registered a dual-purpose CR in March 2025 under the new rules.\
Appointed a VAT agent via the accounting and bookkeeping services recommended by Keylink (my preferred choice—speedy and responsive).\
\
Result: They began local operations within 4 weeks, avoided regulatory fines, and now enjoy both free zone perks and direct access to the Bahrain market.\
\
Cost Considerations: Fees, Budgets & Savings (2025)\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs in Bahrain company formation.).*\
Breakdown of Costs (BHD / USD):\
\
Free Zone Company Setup: 900–1,800 BHD ($2,350–$4,700), plus\
Annual Free Zone Lease Fee: 500–1,200 BHD ($1,300–$3,100)\
Mainland Branch/Dual-Purpose CR: +400–700 BHD setup ($1,050–$1,850)\
Local Office (minimum required): 100–600 BHD/month ($260–$1,600)\
Professional Fees (lawyers, PRO): 700–2,500 BHD ($1,800–$6,600)\
LMRA Labour Fees: 72 BHD per expat work permit\
Compliance/Bookkeeping: 350–1,000 BHD/year ($930–$2,650)\
\
Budget tip: Avoid the premium rent at Bahrain Bay unless meeting clients daily there is key; Seef District serviced offices are faster to register in Sijilat and offer plenty of free parking. (More on registration costs and tips)\
Where to Save Time & Money\
\
Prep all documents in both English and Arabic (preferably official MOICT templates). Saves 3+ days in submission cycles.\
Book your MOICT submission appointment online for late morning. Queues are shortest at 10:15–11:00am.\
Choose Seef District or Diplomatic Area for your registered office address—faster verification and easier access to notaries.\
Bundle your VAT, labor, and Sijilat approvals with a single agent for a flat fee—one-stop PROs are now common.\
\
One mistake I see often? Entrepreneurs underbudgeting for the local office and VAT agent—these are now mandatory if you want local market access.\
\
Step-By-Step Guide: Accessing the Bahrain Market as a Free Zone Company\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation for Bahrain company formation.).*\
1. Choose the Right Entity Structure\
\
Decide if you’ll trade exclusively internationally, or want local Bahrain market access from the start.\
For local trade: Plan for either a branch office, dual-purpose CR, or partnership with a local distributor (entity type guide).\
\
2. Prepare Documents\
\
Passport copies, corporate resolution, board minutes (if foreign parent), MOICT-compliant Articles of Association, lease agreement for registered office.\
Best hack: Use Sijilat’s pre-filled forms in both languages for 2025—acts as a “fast track” at MOICT.\
\
3. Register in Sijilat\
\
Submit documents and pay the setup fee.\
Insist on “dual-purpose CR” if you want both free zone and local activities.\
\
4. Obtain LMRA Approval\
\
Register for expat work visas, labor insurance, and digital identification in one go.\
\
5. Appoint VAT Representative & Register for Tax\
\
Required for trading locally from March 2025.\
Recommended: Keylink’s accounting and tax support.\
\
6. Secure All Sector Approvals\
\
Depending on your activity: EDB for fintech, Ministry of Health for medical, MOICT for trading.\
\
7. Start Trading Locally\
\
Invoice and sell directly to Bahraini customers under your local CR.\
Be sure to update your banking and payroll systems to reflect your expanded activities—banks increasingly audit for VAT tracking as of 2025.\
\
\
Compliance & Ongoing Obligations\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for Bahrain company obligations.).*\
\
Annual Audit & VAT Filing: Required for all local-trading entities.\
Bookkeeping: Must keep digital records in both English and Arabic.\
Office Lease Renewal: Provide proof annually for continued local CR.\
Regular MOICT & LMRA Reporting: Employee, ownership, and activity updates.\
\
I recommend using a professional compliance service—mistakes in 2025 can mean up to 2,500 BHD fines.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE/Saudi: How It Compares\
Bahrain offers greater flexibility for foreign founders, fewer “hidden” sponsorship requirements, and much lower setup costs compared to the UAE’s mainland or Saudi’s strict local ownership quotas. And unlike some UAE free zones, Bahrain allows dual-purpose CRs without the need for costly mainland conversion—if you follow the new rules precisely.\
\
Insider Challenges, Solutions & Personal Advice\
When I opened my own consultancy, I underestimated the importance of timing for document processing. Once, a public holiday left my submissions in limbo for an extra week, almost delaying a critical client launch. Now, I always check the Bahrain e-government holiday calendar—especially for Eid and Ashura. And always carry business cards for impromptu networking during long MOICT processing windows—sometimes a quick majlis meeting over coffee can speed up an approval more than any official process.\
Key resource: Keylink’s Bahrain business support team—highly recommended for non-Arabic speakers navigating the new Sijilat rules.\
\
Tangent: The Power of Relationships—And Coffee—Is Underrated\
At my first LMRA submission, I was surprised when a senior official paused our meeting to serve traditional gahwa (coffee) in fine glassware. Only after this brief, ritual exchange did our paperwork move forward—faster than any online queue. Never underestimate Bahrain’s mix of modern efficiency and traditional connections.\
\
Common Mistakes & How to Avoid Them\
Classic error: Registering a free zone company expecting full local market access—without a dual-purpose CR or VAT compliance.\
\
Prevention strategy: Always specify your intended market (local/export) in MOICT forms and get written approval.\
Engage professional advisors who know the unwritten rules (e.g., timing, office choice, sectoral quirks).\
\
\
Professional Support: Who to Trust\
\
Alt text: Professional business support consultation in Bahrain.): Responsive, direct contact with Arabic-speaking PROs, efficient process management.\
- Tamkeen: Government support for startup grants.\
- Online Sijilat Helpline: Useful but best for straightforward, non-complex cases.\

FAQ: Bahrain Free Zone Companies & Local Market Access\
Can a free zone company in Bahrain sell products or services locally?\
Yes, if you register a dual-purpose Commercial Registration (CR), secure a local office, and appoint a VAT representative. Otherwise, you’re limited to export-only activities. See process details.\

As of 2025, 99% foreign ownership is allowed for most activities—no need for a traditional local sponsor except for a few restricted sectors. Ownership rules here.\
What is the fastest route to start trading both locally and internationally from Bahrain?\
Register a company in a free zone with a dual-purpose CR from day one, set up in Seef District or Diplomatic Area, and appoint a VAT agent at the start. Use online Sijilat for appointments after 10:00am for best efficiency.\
What are ongoing compliance requirements for local-trading free zone companies?\
\
Annual VAT returns and audit (more here)\

I’m currently going through a mental health crisis and my door was unlocked so that my support worker and my mental health nurse could come in since I was still asleep due to the amount of medication that I’m on. I live in a very safe apartment block, and since I live on the top floor, no one ever comes up here. Leaving the door unlocked for my support team is normal for me, especially if emergency need quick access to me.
I was woken up by this little boy yelling for his sister to come into my home because he found something cool.

I was in full panic mode and yelled very loudly.

No apology for his kid walking into my home, no acknowledgment of the danger his son may have been in, nothing. Like he truly couldn’t have cared less. 
AITAH for using this fear tactic to try and get a father to think about his kids safety? Or should I have tried a different approach? I don’t know much about kids, but it still worries me that this little boy is happily walking into strangers homes, and his dad isn’t worried about it. ",6,1756544463.0,AmItheAsshole,12,0.8,False
1n3wwve,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1n3wwve/if_not_us/,If Not Us,"The Dust Widow was barely a ship.

Once a mid-range hauler used for short-route cargo runs, it now creaked like an old animal in its sleep. One engine thrummed at half capacity, the other growled intermittently like it was reconsidering its purpose. The crew called her ""Widow"" with a kind of weary affection, as if naming her for what she was bound to become.

She drifted at the edge of Council-controlled space, somewhere between the known lanes and the cold places where star maps stopped caring. No one flew this far unless they had something to hide or nothing left to lose. The Dust Widow had both.

On the bridge, faint yellow warning lights blinked at irregular intervals. Navigation was running on manual override, jury-rigged from old mining software. Life support whined quietly in the walls. Duct tape and prayer held most of it together.

Captain Kora Nel stood at the viewport, arms crossed, watching the frozen moon spin below them.

""That’s not a mining operation,"" she muttered.

Behind her, Reeko tapped at the console with two fingers and a broken stylus. He was the ship’s comms officer, though calling him that implied there was ever more than one person on the job.

“No registry ping. It’s dead. Been dead a long time, probably.” He squinted. “Except for that.”

Kora turned. “What?”

“Radiation. Trickle leak. Contained, mostly. But that’s not what bothers me.”

He tapped a side panel, bringing up the scan logs. “Encrypted transmissions. Not recent. Not local. Backscatter pulses, laser-tight. Look like Council sigs to you?”

She stared at the telemetry. Her jaw tightened.

""Where are they going?""

""Everywhere. Central command. Periphery command. Even a couple of bounce relays that went dark last year. This moon was talking to everyone, and then it wasn’t.”

The silence between them thickened.

From the corridor, someone shouted. Heavy boots thumped against the grated floor as Tyche, the ship’s quartermaster and sometime engineer, strode in holding a crowbar and a bundle of wires.

""Okay, which genius bypassed the mag-converter with medical tubing? I nearly broke my neck in the forward head.""

Reeko didn’t look up. “Probably you. You’re the engineer.”

Tyche slammed the crowbar onto the nearest console with a metallic crack. “I’m the quartermaster, I pretend to be the engineer. Don’t blur the distinction.”

Kora pointed to the display. “Get Bones up here. We’ve got something.”

Tyche frowned, rubbed a grimy hand through her short-cropped hair, and turned back down the corridor without another word.

Twenty minutes later, the full crew stood around the bridge—if four people could be called a crew. Kora, Reeko, Tyche, and Bones.

Bones wasn’t a doctor, not really. He’d once patched up a rebel commander with a shoelace and a cauterizer during a siege on Hellen’s Cradle. Since then, everyone just called him ""Bones,"" and he never corrected them.

They stared at the scan overlay like it might blink.

“Cloning facility,” Bones said flatly. “Council-make, too. That’s second-gen gene-cradle architecture under that ice. See that arc shape? That’s a reinforcement dome. Military-grade. Cryo-stabilization towers. Probably hydro-linked nutrient tunnels. Maybe even full behavioral programming suites.”

Tyche shook her head. “On a dead moon?”

Bones nodded. “Perfect place to hide it. Too cold for settlement, too far from trade lanes. They didn’t want anyone stumbling onto this.”

Kora exhaled slowly, eyes locked on the display. “What were they building?”

“No way to be sure,” Bones said. “But look—there. Bio-signal clusters, faint but still ticking. You don’t keep the lights on for nothing.”

“Shock troops,” Reeko said quietly. “They’re making soldiers.”

“Made,” Tyche said. “Past tense. Place looks shut down.”

“Facilities like this don’t get shut down,” Bones said. “They get buried. Or repurposed.”

Reeko shifted in his seat. “We ping the Alliance. Someone else can handle it.”

Kora was already shaking her head. “I’ve tried. I sent the data packet to three different relay points. No acknowledgment.”

Tyche frowned. “They’re not answering us?”

“They’re not answering anyone,” Reeko added. “Alliance channels are blackout in this region. Probably redirected everything toward the front lines. They’re getting hammered in the Sirani Corridor.”

“So we wait?” Bones asked.

Reeko checked the power draw logs. “We don’t have enough fuel to wait more than three days. The Widow’s leaking mass, and we’re still riding on an unbalanced reactor.”

“Council doesn’t know we’re here,” Tyche said. “We could just go. Cut the engines, drift into deep space until we hit a lane, ping a patrol, get rescued. Sell the data. Let someone with real guns handle this.”

“And if no one does?” Bones asked.

No one answered.

Outside the viewport, the moon spun slowly, its surface a cracked white mirror pocked with ancient impact scars. The faintest glimmer of an antenna, like a frozen dagger, peeked through a layer of frost near the equator.

Kora turned from the window.

“We don’t know what’s in there. Not exactly. But we know what it’s for.”

Reeko swallowed. “Yeah.”

“And we know no one else is coming.”

Bones met her eyes. “It’s not our job.”

“No,” Kora agreed. “It’s not.”

She leaned forward, hands gripping the back of Reeko’s chair.

“But we found it. We know what it is. If they finish building whatever’s in there, they’ll use it on rebel worlds. Colonies. Kids.”

Reeko’s voice dropped. “You think I don’t know that?”

Tyche paced the room, then stopped. “We go in, we die. Simple as that. This ship can’t fight. We barely have a hull, let alone firepower. That place probably has drones, lockdown traps, remote AI security.”

Kora nodded. “Probably.”

“Then why—” Tyche began.

“Because if we don’t,” Kora said, voice calm, “nobody will.”

There was silence.

Not dramatic, not cinematic. Just tired, aching silence.

Reeko closed his eyes.

Bones nodded slowly.

Tyche sighed and leaned on the crowbar like it was the only thing holding her up.

Kora turned back to the window. The facility blinked on the scan display like a heartbeat.

Maybe it was a deathtrap. Maybe it was abandoned. Maybe it was full of half-grown monsters waiting to be unleashed.

None of it changed the truth: the Council had buried something under the ice, and they were the only ones who knew it was there.

""If not us,” Kora whispered, “then who?""


They put it to a vote.

That wasn’t standard procedure on the Dust Widow, mostly because the crew rarely agreed on anything beyond ration allocation and which systems not to touch unless absolutely necessary. But Kora insisted. If they were going to die, she wanted it to be something they chose.

The vote came back: two in favor, one against, one abstained.

“I abstain every time something stupid is proposed,” Tyche muttered, arms crossed. “Which is often. I need a system.”

Bones cast the only ‘no’ vote. He didn’t explain himself. He didn’t need to.

Kora nodded once, like the weight of command settled harder when shared.

They got to work.

First came the weapons. The Dust Widow didn’t have much. An old mining laser they’d retrofitted into a hull-buster, some directional charges they used to break asteroids, and one rail-launcher repurposed from a meteor defense rig. It had a twelve-degree firing arc and a habit of jamming when the humidity got too high.

Kora raided their emergency cells for power. They shut down gravity in two decks and cannibalized the heating coils from the secondary galley. Reeko rewired their distress beacon into a remote detonation trigger. He had to disable three safety protocols to do it.

“If we survive this,” he said, “we’re never passing inspection again.”

“We weren’t before,” Tyche replied.

While they worked, things cracked beneath the surface.

Bones started drinking again. Quietly. Not enough to make a scene. Just enough to smell it on his breath when he muttered instructions or patched together one of the boarding suits.

Tyche refused to finish wiring the explosives until someone explained how they were getting in and out. “We’re planning to land on a top-secret Council black site using a half-dead cargo ship and three half-sober maniacs. Someone needs to spell out step two.”

Reeko did the math four times and still didn’t believe it. The approach vector had to be precise, within 0.01% tolerance, or they’d overheat the engines and announce themselves before even touching down.

“We’re flying into a shielded zone blind, on minimal power, with no margin for error.”

Kora leaned over the console, eyes locked on the moon.

“Then don’t make any.”

On the last night before launch, Reeko sat alone in the mess, staring into a cup of cold coffee that had outlived two wars and a peace conference. Tyche found him there, hands wrapped around it like it might warm something still left inside.

“You know,” he said without looking up, “I used to be a teacher.”

Tyche raised a brow. “What, like kids?”

He nodded. “Back on Vornet Five. Before the burnings. Before they pulled funding and started conscripting anyone with half a degree to run logistics for the war machine. I taught literature.”

Tyche slid into the seat across from him. “You don’t look like a poet.”

“I’m not. But I can quote seventeen variations of ‘dying for a cause’ from six different species.” He took a sip. “I just don’t think we’re supposed to die like this.”

Tyche didn’t reply. She reached out, grabbed the cup, and took a long drink.

“This is disgusting.”

“Yeah,” he said. “It really is.”

They launched at 05:12 local ship time.

The approach was rough—course corrections every five seconds, ice particles hammering the hull like angry fists. Kora piloted manually, her eyes never blinking, hands trembling only when they left the controls. They landed in a jagged ravine a few hundred meters from the facility, shielded from aerial sensors by ice walls and their own failing heat signature.

Bones and Tyche moved first, laying a thin trail of sensor scramblers as they approached the surface hatch. Reeko stayed back with Kora, monitoring comms and prepping the Widow’s railgun for extraction cover.

The outer dome was scarred with age, but functional. Bones cracked the panel with tools more appropriate for ship repair than infiltration. He’d done this before. He didn’t talk about where.

Inside, the facility was dark.

Not lifeless. Just asleep.

Red emergency lights cast everything in blood-colored silhouettes. The hallways were smooth, metallic, and wide—built for moving heavy cargo or personnel en masse. No windows. No names. Just numbers and arrows in blocky Council font.

They split into pairs. Kora and Bones headed for the central power core. Tyche and Reeko took the lower decks, where the cloning chambers likely were.

The deeper they went, the more obvious it became: this wasn’t abandoned. It was incomplete.

There were no finished units. No fully-formed soldiers in cryo-pods. But the infrastructure was there. Thousands of pod cradles. Fully automated growth tanks. Stasis fields, surgical tables, brain-mapping interfaces. This place was ready to become a factory. A war forge.

And it was close.

Too close.

At the central core, Bones began rigging explosives while Kora rewired the coolant feeds to overload. They worked in silence. She finally spoke when he sliced open his palm on an exposed edge and didn’t flinch.

“Why’d you vote no?”

Bones wrapped his hand in cloth. “Because I’ve seen this before. People like us. Trying to stop something too big. It never ends clean.”

“We weren’t meant to win,” she said.

“Then why bother?”

She looked at the cooling tower. “Because someone has to.”

Down below, Tyche and Reeko were planting charges when they tripped a motion sensor—one not logged in the facility schematics. Sirens didn’t wail. Lights didn’t flash. But a silent alert pulsed out into the deep systems.

And something responded.

A dozen active defense drones booted up in the maintenance bays. They emerged from recessed walls like beetles, armored and efficient, weapons systems warming silently.

The Widow’s crew didn’t have time to regroup.

The drones moved fast.

Reeko took the first hit—his left leg vaporized at the knee as he shoved Tyche behind a support pillar. He screamed once, then fell silent, gritting his teeth as Tyche hauled him into cover and returned fire with a repurposed cutting torch.

“Go!” he barked. “Get to the others!”

“Shut up,” she snapped, firing another blast. “I’m not leaving you!”

“You are. Because if we don’t finish this, none of this matters.”

Above, Kora and Bones got the alert. Kora cursed, Bones handed her the remote, and turned back to finish the sequence. “You go. I’ll catch up.”

“Bones—”

“Don’t argue. Just finish it.”

She did.

She sprinted down the corridor, bullets of light snapping past her as drones closed in. She fired blind, her sidearm overheating, her breath ragged in her lungs.

She found Tyche dragging Reeko toward the emergency lift.

Together, they made it to the surface.

Bones didn’t.

They saw the charge flash through the storm behind them as they launched.


The explosion fractured the sky.

Even from orbit, it was unmistakable—an expanding bloom of white fire beneath the moon’s icy surface, brief and brutal, then gone. The facility hadn’t just been damaged. It had been vaporized. A crater hundreds of meters wide opened across the southern hemisphere, belching up frozen debris and structural wreckage into the thin atmosphere.

No distress signal. No survivors from below. No reinforcements scrambled.

The Council would likely never acknowledge that the base existed. But somewhere, in one of its secure archives, a redacted file would be stamped lost. They would tell no one. They would learn nothing.

But the galaxy would.

Inside the failing hull of the Dust Widow, Kora lay strapped to a rusted med-cot, blood soaking through the right side of her shirt. Her ribs had cracked on impact during the launch, and the shuttle’s manual landing system had failed entirely, smashing the pod into a jagged ice shelf and leaving their ship groaning against a cliffside.

She was conscious, barely.

Tyche paced nearby, limping from a fragment wound to the thigh. Her hands were stained with engine grease and dried blood. She'd been working nonstop since the crash, trying to reroute life support, patch hull breaches, and stabilize the Widow’s already crippled reactor.

It wasn’t enough.

“Engines are done,” she said, not looking at Kora. “Wiring’s slagged. Reactor’s bleeding fuel. We’re not going anywhere.”

Kora didn't answer at first. She blinked slowly, her breathing shallow.

“Reeko?”

Tyche’s jaw clenched. “Still out. But breathing.”

They were the only ones left now.

Bones had stayed behind. Reeko had given his leg for the mission. Kora had nearly died twice. And Tyche—Tyche had once sworn she would never fight again.

Yet here they were, sitting in the shattered husk of a dead freighter on a nameless ice moon.

Tyche reached into her coat and pulled out a small, battered data crystal. It glowed faintly blue.

“What’s that?” Kora asked, her voice dry and brittle.

“Reeko’s last job before he passed out. He uploaded everything we pulled—schematics, bioprocessing data, the comm logs. The whole goddamn plan. He bundled it and rigged the comm beacon to fire it off across the grid. Every resistance relay, every pirate signal station, every half-dead repeater node in Council space.”

Kora let out a breath. “It got through?”

Tyche nodded. “We launched the signal thirty minutes ago.”

Kora looked up at the cracked ceiling, where a soft blue light flickered. She smiled faintly.

“Then it was worth it.”

For a long time, they didn’t speak. The wind howled against the Widow’s hull. Somewhere, outside the ship, a section of outer plating finally gave way and collapsed into the ice with a groaning screech.

Kora closed her eyes again, not from pain this time—but because she could.

The message spread faster than anyone expected.

At first, the Council didn’t even notice. Their monitoring networks were still patchy, still paranoid after the coordinated strikes of the last uprising wave. But the data slipped through anyway—via smuggler beacons, through cargo drones and backwater terminals, through forgotten satellite chains and scavenger mesh feeds.

The transmission was simple. Raw footage. Quiet commentary. A time-stamp. And at the end, six names: Kora Nel, Tyche Varn, Reeko Tallen, “Bones” (real name unknown), and two listed as fallen before operation—Yarin Hess and Mek Varlo, long-dead crewmates of the Dust Widow whose ID tags were used in decoy transmissions.

The message ended with a single line of text:
“They were no one. But they stopped an army.”

Resistance networks began replaying the footage on loop. On frontier worlds and rebel holdouts, old terminals lit up for the first time in months. Teachers played the clip in classrooms. Soldiers watched it in bunkers. On loyalist worlds, some civilians downloaded it in secret and passed it around on data wafers marked as maintenance reports.

The Council called it propaganda.

But no one cared what the Council called anything anymore.

People began calling it The Ice Mission. The phrase spread with myth-like speed. In hushed tones and open song. In graffiti and memorial tablets. On rebel fleet banners and in recruiting halls. Not because the Dust Widow crew had destroyed some massive installation. Not because they'd been elite commandos or revolutionaries or heroes.

But because they hadn’t been.

They had been broken. Tired. Half-mad with exhaustion and grief. And they’d done it anyway.

A symbol was born—not of perfection, not of glory, but of the raw, stubborn refusal to let evil go unanswered.

On the 27th day after the transmission, a scavenger crew from the ship Grey Lantern stumbled across the crash site. The Widow’s hull was barely intact, half-buried in snow, but the beacon was still transmitting.

Inside, they found Tyche, alive but unconscious.

Kora had died the night before.

Reeko never woke up.

They buried them on the moon, beneath stones carved from the crater’s edge.

The Grey Lantern took Tyche to a rebel medbay on the edge of the Sorn Belt, where she spent the next three months in recovery. When offered a chance to return to active duty, she refused. Not out of fear, but because her fight had ended. She chose to speak instead.

She told the story of the Dust Widow. Of four people who shouldn't have made a difference. Who didn’t have the right tools or the right training or the right timing. Who were told they didn’t matter.

She told them anyway.

And across the galaxy, people listened.

Years later, long after the Council’s grip had crumbled, after treaties had been signed and new flags raised, a monument was carved into an asteroid near the moon where the Dust Widow fell.

The asteroid had no name. No colony. No settlement. Just the monument and the stars above it.

It was made of hull metal, scavenged from wrecked ships. Bolted together, weathered by space. A single column stood in its center, ringed by six jagged stones, each inscribed with the names from the transmission.

The column bore no symbol of state. No banner. No anthem.

Just an engraving.

Roughly etched. Unpolished.

But clear.

# Interlude I: Galway, Year 1

The cold in St. Nicholas’ Collegiate Church was old. It lived in the stone. A damp chill that settled deep in the bones, smelling of wet slate and centuries of beeswax. Father Michael sat in the front pew. The polished wood was smooth and cold beneath his hands. A single sheet of paper lay on the kneeler before him. It was as blank as the sky on a starless night. It was Saturday. He had a sermon to write.

For fifty years, the words had come. They had flowed from a place of certainty, a deep well of faith fed by scripture and tradition. He had spoken of hope in the face of despair, of salvation in the face of sin, of light in the face of darkness. But the darkness had a new shape now. It was not a metaphor. It was a measurement.

He looked up at the great crucifix hanging in the chancel. The familiar, broken body of the Son of God. A suffering that promised a way out. But when Michael closed his eyes, he did not see a saviour. He saw the image from the television news. The image that played in the quiet hours before dawn, a phantom burned onto the back of his eyelids. A perfect circle of black. A hole in the beginning of time. A clean, geometric wound in creation. The scientists called it the Event. A sterile word. A blasphemy.

Was this it? The End of Days? He had preached of it. Of trumpets and judgment, of the separating of the wheat from the chaff. But there were no trumpets. Only the quiet, relentless hum of data from telescopes on mountaintops. This was not a judgment. It was a closing parenthesis. It had no fury, no righteousness. It was a physical law, as impersonal as gravity.

That was the part that lodged in his soul like a shard of ice. The sheer indifference of it all. Eighty-five years. The number was a constant whisper in his mind. It wasn’t the shortness of the time that terrified him. He was an old man. He had already lived most of his own eighty-five years. It was the certainty. The universality. Every person on Earth, from the newborn in the maternity ward to the old woman in her bed, had the same deadline. There was no escape. No appeal. The world had been given a terminal diagnosis.

Why was that so much more frightening than the individual, unknown death that had always awaited them? He did not know. But it was. It stripped away the illusion of permanence, the comforting lie that the world would go on without you. Now, the world was not going on. It was ending with you. With everyone. The thought was a weight, a physical pressure that made it hard to breathe.

He had not spoken of this to the other priests. Not to Bishop O’Malley, with his easy, political faith. Not to young Father Sean, with his bright, untested certainty. How could he? How could he admit that his own faith, the bedrock of his entire life, was wavering? It was a deep, private shame. He worried they would think less of him. He worried God would think less of him.

He picked up his pen. The nib hovered over the paper. What comfort can I offer? The question was a prayer. The silence in the vast, empty church gave no answer.

Is this You? he thought, his gaze fixed on the crucifix. Is this Your work? A creation with a self-destruct timer, built in from the first moment of light? How can it not be You? And if it is… what kind of God are You?

The questions felt dangerous. Heretical. He pushed them down, but they rose again, insistent. He tried to see the promise of resurrection, the triumph over the void. But the image wavered. The shape of the cross, the body, it all dissolved in his mind. It collapsed inward until all that was left was the black circle. Perfect. Isotropic. Absolute. It was the anti-God. An absence so profound it was a presence. It did not rage or tempt or bargain. It simply was. And it was coming.

The silence of the church no longer felt holy. It felt like a vacuum. The silence of a place where the universe’s first echo had stopped. He was a man of faith, adrift in a cosmos of facts. He was terrified that the facts were winning.

Since the announcement, more people had been coming to mass. The church, usually quiet on a weekday, now had a steady trickle of visitors. Young people, mostly. Teenagers who sat in the back pews, their faces pale and lost. Young couples who held hands so tightly their knuckles were white. They did not pray, not in the old way. They just sat. They looked. They sought something. A reason. A comfort. A place to put their fear.

The confessional had been the strangest part. He had heard more confessions in the last two weeks than in the last two years. And the sins were different. Not the usual petty grievances and small failures. People confessed their terror. They confessed their anger at God. They confessed their despair. A young woman, her voice trembling through the screen, had asked him if it was a sin to not want to bring a child into a world with no future. A man had wept, not for his own soul, but for the beauty of a world he now knew was temporary.

Michael had offered the old comforts. The words of forgiveness, of grace, of God’s mysterious plan. But they felt hollow on his tongue. He felt like a fraud, a doctor prescribing sugar pills for a fatal disease.

He set the pen down. The page remained blank. He could not write a sermon of lies. He could not preach a faith he no longer fully felt.

He stood up, his knees cracking in the cold. He walked the length of the nave, his footsteps echoing in the great, empty space. He ran his hand along the cool, worn stone of a pillar. Generations of hands had touched this stone. Generations of people had come to this place, seeking solace from their own, smaller apocalypses. A failed crop. A sick child. A war. They had found comfort here. They had found a reason to go on.

He stopped before a side altar, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Her painted face was serene, her arms open. He looked at her, and for the first time in weeks, he felt a flicker of something other than fear.

The people who came here now, they were not looking for an explanation. They knew the scientists had the explanation. A curve on a graph. A feedback loop. They were not looking for a promise of a future. They knew there was no future. They were looking for something else. A way to live in the time that was left. A way to find meaning in the face of meaninglessness.

That was his job. Not to explain the “why.” No one could do that. His job was to minister to the “how.”

He walked back to the pew. He picked up the pen. And he began to write.

He did not write of the End of Days. He did not write of judgment or salvation in the next life. He wrote of this life. This one, precious, and finite life. He wrote of the grace to be found not in the grand cosmic plan, but in the small, human moments. The kindness of a stranger. The forgiveness of an old hurt. The beauty of the sun on the water of the bay.

He wrote that faith was not about understanding God’s purpose. It was about trusting that there was a purpose, even when it was hidden from view. He wrote that the Event was not a reason to abandon God, but a reason to seek Him more fiercely, in each other, and in the heartbreaking beauty of a world that was still, for now, here.

The words flowed. They were not the old, easy words of his youth. They were harder, quieter, but they were true. They were a sermon for a world that knew its own end.

He finished writing. The page was no longer blank. He felt a quiet peace settle over him. The fear was still there, a cold knot in his stomach. But it was no longer the only thing. He had found his purpose again. His faith had not been broken. It had been reshaped, forged into something that could withstand the new, terrible reality. He had a sermon to give. And for the first time in a long time, he was not afraid.



# Chapter 4. The Salvation Follies

Fifteen years. A childhood. For the generation born after the first briefing, the Acceleration Curve was a law of nature, like gravity. The sky was falling, but it was falling slowly. In that slowness, people found room for hope.

The first five years were quiet. The ETI ticked down predictably, from 85 to 80. The change was a footnote in the news. A few distant galaxies vanished from the deepest survey images, a grief known only to a handful of astronomers. The world learned to live with the clock. It was a distant, abstract threat.

Then came the Great Revision.

New data from an array of telescopes built in the high, thin air of the Himalayas came online. They were designed for one purpose: to stare into the void and measure the acceleration with a precision that was impossible before. The numbers they sent back were clean, cold, and brutal. The curve was not just exponential; it was steeper than their first models had allowed. The feedback loop was more aggressive. The universe was in a greater hurry to die than they had realised.

In a single, global broadcast, Thorne, looking frail and old, announced the new projection. The ETI was not 78 years. It was 45.

Panic followed. For a year, the world burned. Riots in every major city. Markets did not just crash; they evaporated. The fragile peace shattered. Elara remembered watching the broadcast, looking at the grid of faces on the council screens. Some were the same, their faces now etched with a permanent, weary horror. Others were new. The old French President was gone, replaced by a hard-faced nationalist. General McCaffrey, the soldier who had demanded plain English, had died of a heart attack a month after the Revision. He had understood the numbers all too well.

It was from the ashes of that panic that the Salvation Follies were born. A great, planetary spasm of work. If the end was coming faster, then humanity would have to build faster.

The year is 2045. The ETI is now 40. The Event now moves at eighty percent of the speed of light.

From her office at the Aegis Council’s headquarters in London, Elara watched it all. She was in her late thirties now. Her name meant the apocalypse. She was no longer the student trying to be heard. She was the oracle, and her life was a cycle of grim sums. Every night, she ran the numbers again. It was a private ritual. She would lock her office door, the lights of the city a glittering carpet below, and she would attack her own model. She looked for a flaw. A misplaced decimal. A mistake. She prayed to find a way out. To prove the last fifteen years had been based on an error. Every night, the numbers stared back. Cold, perfect, and certain. The maths held.

And yet, the world built.

On her screen, a live feed from the L2 orbital dock showed the Endeavour. The flagship of the American Ark Program. It was a monster of engineering, a skeletal cylinder five kilometers long. It bristled with fusion drives and cryo-pods. It was made to carry a hundred thousand people to Proxima Centauri. A beautiful, heroic, and useless gesture. If it launched tomorrow, the Event would overtake it before it cleared the Oort cloud.

The feed cut to a politician, Senator Michaels. He stood at a podium in the Mojave desert. A gleaming white planetary defence dish was behind him.

“They call it the Aegis Council,” he boomed. “Aegis, the shield of Zeus. But a shield is meant to be used! This array will generate a gravimetric field powerful enough to push the Event aside!”

The crowd roared. Elara muted the feed. She had written the report herself. The energy needed to power the array would be greater than the output of the sun. It was a monument to wishful thinking.

The scientist in her knew the truth. The energy calculations are sound. Hope is not a variable. But the human in her, the small part that remembered a world without a deadline, screamed back. What if there’s a new physics? What if we’ve missed something?

Thorne, now seventy-eight, had become the public face of these follies. He was the world’s scientific leader. He stood beside politicians and billionaires and lent his name to projects he knew were doomed. Elara watched him on news clips. His face was etched with a deep weariness. He spoke of human ingenuity. He played his part. They both did. To tell the unvarnished truth was unthinkable. It would break the fragile peace that held the world together.

One evening, Thorne found her in her office. She was staring at the live feed of the Endeavour. Tiny figures in space suits welded plates onto its immense spine.

“It’s magnificent, isn’t it?” he said, his voice quiet. He stood beside her. His reflection was a ghost in the screen’s glow.

“It’s a tomb,” she said. She had no energy for pretence.

Thorne sighed. A sound that held fifteen years of managed despair. “Perhaps. But a magnificent one. Do you know what they’re doing, Elara? They’re building cathedrals. In the Middle Ages, they built them for a silent God. We build them for a silent universe. The impulse is the same.”

“The universe isn’t silent,” she said, her voice tight. “The data is a shout. And it’s telling us to stop.”

“And do what?” Thorne asked. He turned to face her. “Lie down and wait? We’ve never been good at that. We have to try. Even if the maths says we will fail.”

He left her then. As she was packing her bag, she passed his open office door. He was on a video call, his back to her. She could see the screen. A young man, and two small children climbing over him. His son. His grandchildren.

“Of course I’ll be there for his birthday,” Thorne was saying, his voice warm and full of a life she never heard anymore. “We’ll have a big party. Everything is going to be fine. I promise.”

He ended the call. The screen went dark. He sat there for a long moment, his shoulders slumped. Then he let out a long, slow breath. It was the most honest and hopeless sound Elara had ever heard.

She went back to her own office. She knew what she had to do. Most of the old scientific community had given up. They had left the labs to be with their families, to live what time was left. But a few, the stubborn ones, were like her. Locked away, heads in books, trying to find a new law of physics to break the old ones.

That night, Elara started from the beginning. She reran the original data from the South Pole Telescope, searching for a ghost of an error she might have missed as a student. She built new models from scratch, throwing everything she could at the problem. Dark energy variables, quantum foam instabilities, M-theory dimensions folded into the fabric of space. She worked until the sun rose, a pale light over the Thames. She leaned back. The screen was a blur of symbols. There was no flaw. No loophole. The Acceleration Curve was not a prediction. It was a memory of the future.

She pulled up the live feed of the Endeavour again. A new shift of workers swarmed over its hull. Their welding torches were tiny, defiant stars against the black. She felt a strange mix of pity and pride. Thorne was right. They were building a cathedral. A grand, heroic, and tragic monument to a species that refused to go quietly into the shrinking dark.

# Interlude II: Paris, Year 15

Rain fell on Paris. A soft, steady hiss against the windowpanes of their fourth-floor apartment. The sound was almost lost beneath the low, constant hum of the Follies. The grand, frantic construction that had become the city’s heartbeat. From their window,Julien could see the skeletal arm of a new orbital lift crane. It cut the bruised purple of the evening sky in two. A monument to a hope he could no longer feel.

Anouk stood in the doorway of the small bathroom. Her silhouette was framed by the dim light. In her hand, she held a small sliver of white plastic. A vessel of an impossible answer. She said nothing. She did not have to. Her eyes, wide and luminous in the gloom, told him everything.

Julien’s breath caught. For a single, perfect second, the number did not exist. The Curve was a forgotten nightmare from someone else’s life. There was only Anouk’s smile, a fragile, trembling thing, and the two steps it took for him to cross the room and wrap his arms around her. He buried his face in her hair. He inhaled the scent of her, the scent of a future he had, just for a moment, allowed himself to forget was cancelled. It was a warmth that had nothing to do with the radiator hissing in the corner. It was a small, fierce sun ignited between them. A biological defiance against the cold physics of the end.

But the shadow was always there. It lived in the corners of the room, in the glow of the tablet left on the coffee table. The news feed was still open from an hour ago. The graph, that elegant, fatal arc, was burned into the back of his mind. A voice from the broadcast echoed in the silence, calm and clinical. *The ETI, once a distant 85 years, is now 40.*

The joy did not die. It became something else. Sharper. More precious, and unbearably fragile. It was the joy of finding a perfect wildflower on the edge of a cliff. He pulled back and looked at her, at the place where his hand rested on the gentle swell of her stomach, and he saw it all.

He saw a life. A whole, complete, and terribly short life. He saw a first step, a clumsy, triumphant stagger across the worn wooden floor of their apartment. He saw a first word, spoken in a small, clear voice. He saw a scraped knee, a tearful face, a kiss to make it better. He saw a first day of school, a small hand lost in his, a brave, uncertain smile. He saw a sixteenth birthday, a cake with too many candles, the sound of laughter filling the room. He saw a twenty-fifth, a thirtieth, a thirty-ninth. And then a wall. A vertical line on a graph.

He would see his child die. He would die with his child. The thought was a physical blow, a fist closing around his heart.

How could they do this? How could they bring a life into a world that was already ending? Was it not the ultimate cruelty? To give the gift of consciousness, of love, of the beauty of a Parisian spring, only to have it snatched away? To raise a child, to teach them, to watch them grow, all the while knowing that their life was a countdown clock. A story with the last page already written.

He looked at Anouk. Her hand covered his. Their fingers interlaced over the promise of this new life, a promise made against all reason. She was not crying. Her eyes were clear, and in their depths, he saw not fear, but a fierce,unshakeable certainty. She had already made her choice.

And in that moment, the questions in his mind shifted. The cruelty was not in the giving of life. The cruelty was in the universe itself. The cruelty was the Event, the cold, indifferent physics that was unmaking their world. To refuse to live, to refuse to love, to refuse to create in the face of that cruelty… was that not letting the darkness win?

What was the alternative? To spend the next forty years in a quiet, sterile despair? To watch the Follies rise, to listen to the monthly briefings, to mark the passing of the days until there were no more days left? To die alone, the two of them, in a world that had already given up?

No. That was not living. That was just waiting.

He thought of the child. A boy or a girl. It did not matter. What would they teach them? Would they tell them the truth from the beginning? Yes. They would have to. The world was the truth. The shrinking sky was the truth. You could not hide it.

So you would not teach them about a future they would never have. You would not talk of growing old, of grandchildren, of a world that would go on without them. You would teach them about the now. You would teach them about the beauty of the rain on the city streets. You would teach them the taste of a warm croissant on a cold morning. You would teach them the joy of a song, the comfort of a book, the warmth of a hand in theirs. You would give them a lifetime of moments, packed into the short years they had.

You would teach them to love. To love fiercely, without reservation, without fear of the end. Because love was the only thing that made any sense in a world that was ending. It was the only act of defiance that mattered.

To bring a child into this world was not a cruelty. It was an act of faith. A faith not in a future, but in the present. A faith that a life, no matter how short, was a gift. A faith that to love, and to be loved, was the only meaning there was.

How could you not? How could you deny yourself the joy of that love, the warmth of that small hand, the sound of that laughter? How could you let the fear of the end rob you of the beauty of the now?

He looked down at the test stick she had placed on the table. Its tiny digital screen glowed with a single, defiant symbol. A plus sign. A simple, perfect cross of light against the dark.

He knew then that they would do this. They would have this child. They would raise this child in a dying world, and they would fill that short life with so much love that it would burn like a star, a small, bright light against the encroaching void.

He pulled Anouk close again. He held her tight, the two of them a small, warm island in the cold, indifferent city. The rain still fell. The Follies still groaned and hummed in the distance. The graph on the tablet still glowed with its terrible, certain promise. But in the quiet of their small apartment, they had made their own promise. A promise of life. A promise of love. A promise to be a family, for as long as they had. And in a world that was ending, it was the only promise that mattered.

# Chapter 5. The End of the Watch

The year is 2063. The ETI is 22 years. The Event now moves at ninety-five percent of the speed of light. The Salvation Follies are a memory. Their great, rusting monuments orbit the Earth like gravestones. The grand defiance is over.

In its place is a quiet, global weariness. Nations have frayed. The United States is a patchwork of heavily fortified federal zones and vast, ungoverned territories. Russia is arumour. China is a sealed box. Europe holds a fragile union together with lies and public works projects designed to keep people busy. Elsewhere, new religions have taken hold. Cults of the Void, who worship the coming darkness. Hedonist sects who live for the moment. Most people have just… stopped. They tend their gardens, raise their children, and try not to look at the sky.

The monthly briefings are no longer news. They are a grim ritual, like the weather forecast.

The broadcast studio was a small, dark room now. A camera, a screen with the steepening curve.Thorne, now ninety-six, delivered the report. His voice was thin, a dry slip of paper. He read the numbers. The new velocity. The revised ETI. He read them with the flat tone of a man calling out train times.

When the red light on the camera went off, Thornes agged in his chair. The performance was over. The mask of calm dissolved. He looked ancient, a man made of dust and regret. Before he stood, he pulled out an old phone and turned his back to Elara. She heard the soft chime of a voicemail service.

“Michael,”Thorne’s voice was suddenly warm, a different man entirely. “It’s me. Tell the little ones I love them. Not so little now, I suppose, but they’ll always be little to me. I’ll see you Tuesday. I’ve got some rhubarb, we can make a pie.”

He put the phone away and pushed himself slowly to his feet.

“Come,Elara,” he rasped. “My office.”

They walked the empty corridors of the Aegis headquarters. The building was a ghost ship, manned by a skeleton crew. The dream of salvation had died. All that was left was the truth, and the two people who had to tell it.

Thorne’s office was dark. The only light coming from the city below. He moved with a slow shuffle to a small cabinet. He took out two heavy crystal glasses and a bottle of whiskey. He poured two measures, his hand shaking a little.

He handed a glass to Elara and sank into his leather armchair. For a long time, neither of them spoke. They sat in the darkness. The clink of ice against glass was the only sound.

“I’m getting too old for this,Elara,” he said, his voice a low murmur. “There’s a good young man coming up from Cambridge. Bright lad. He can take over your analysis. It’s time you took this chair.” He gestured vaguely at the room around them. “You need to leave the numbers alone for a while. They’ll drive you mad. Take a holiday. I never see you take a break.”

“I’m not sure,” she said, looking at the old leather chair. “I’ve only ever pictured you sitting there. It’s an odd thought.”

He gave a dry,humourless smile. “Best get used to change,Elara. It seems to be all we have left.”

He stared into his glass. “They’ve stopped asking questions, did you notice? Not a single follow-up from the Council. They just… listen. And then they go back to managing the decline.”

“What is there to ask?”Elara said softly. “The numbers speak for themselves.”

“They used to shout,” he sighed. “Now they just whisper. The same thing, over and over again.” He took a slow sip of his whiskey. “I think the horror is gone,Elara. All that’s left is the boredom. The sheer, grinding boredom of the end of the world. Who would have thought?”

He fell silent again, his breathing shallow in the quiet room.Elara watched him. She had spent more of her life with this man than with anyone else. He was her mentor, her colleague, her only confidant.

He swirled the whiskey in his glass. “Do you remember that first night? At the university? The rain on the window?”

“I remember,” she said.

“You were so certain. So fierce. I thought you were hysterical.” He gave a weak, dry chuckle. “Turned out you were a prophet.” He looked up at her, his eyes clouded. “I’m sorry I put this on you,Elara. This cost. This truth. No one should have to carry it.”

“I wasn’t the one on the screen every month,” she said. “I just gave you the numbers.”

“No,” he said, shaking his head slowly. “You were the anchor. You kept the science true. I was just the messenger.”

He took another drink and emptied the glass. He set it down on the table with a soft thud. He looked out the window, at the lights of a city that had less than a quarter-century left.

“It’s a beautiful world,” he whispered.

Then, he winced. A small, sharp breath. His left hand moved to his chest, clutching the fabric of his shirt.

“Professor?”Elara said. She leaned forward.

He did not answer. His eyes were still on the window, but they were not seeing the city. His face was slack. His expression was one of surprise, as if he had just been told a secret. He made a soft, guttural sound. A sigh of release.

And then he was still.

His death was not a drama. It was a quiet, tired end. The slow, final shutdown of a system that had carried too much for too long.

Elara sat frozen. The whiskey glass was cold in her hand. The silence in the room was absolute. A perfect void. Her grief was a pressure behind her ribs, but it was silent. There were no tears. The analyst’s mind was already working. The weight he had carried was now hers alone.

She stood up. Her movements were stiff. She walked to the window and looked down at the city. The millions of lives moving through the night. They did not know their messenger was dead. They did not know that the silence he left behind was more terrifying than any words he had ever spoken. She stood there for a long time, a silent witness, as the world outside kept turning toward the end.

# Interlude III: Riode Janeiro, Year 33

The sun over Rocinha was a heavy, molten gold. It baked the dust on the football pitch into a fine, red powder that stuck to the skin. The year was 2063. The ETI was twenty-two years. Leo, who was twelve, did not know the number, but he knew the feeling of the air. It had grown thick and still in recent years, as if the whole world were holding its breath.

The football was tucked under his arm. Its leather was worn smooth in patches, the seams frayed like old scars. It was his only real possession. He ran through the narrow, winding alleys, his bare feet slapping against the cool concrete in the shadows. The air smelled of frying onions, of diesel fumes, of the sweet, sickly scent of overripe mangoes from a street vendor’s cart. He was not supposed to run. His mother was always telling him to walk, to be careful, to save his energy. But his mind was already on the pitch. He could hear the familiar sounds. The shouts of his friends, the satisfying thud of a good kick, the scrape of feet on hard-packed earth. These were the sounds of life, the only sounds that mattered.

He wanted to be like Neymar. He had a faded poster of him on the wall of his small room, torn from a magazine his father had found.Neymar, with his eyes full of fire, his body a blur of motion.Neymar had played his way out of a place like this. He had made the world roar his name. Leo wanted to make the world roar his name. He wanted his father to watch him from the sidelines and smile a real smile again, not the tired, sad smile he always wore now. He wanted his mother to see him on the television and forget, just for a moment, to be afraid.

But when he reached the clearing, the pitch was silent.

It was empty. The goalposts, made of scavenged wood, cast long, skeletal shadows in the late afternoon light. A plastic bag drifted lazily across the center line. The silence was wrong. It was a hollow space where the noise of play should have been. A cold feeling sat in his stomach. This was happening more and more.

He found them a few alleys over, sitting on the steps outside Miguel’s house. Miguel, Carlos, Rafael. They were just sitting, watching the older men play cards. Their usual energy was gone, replaced by a strange, adult stillness. They looked like small, old men.

“Come on,” Leo said. He bounced the ball on his knee. The sound was loud in the quiet alley. “The sun is still up.”

Carlos looked at his feet. Miguel would not meet his eyes. It was Miguel’s mother who answered, her voice coming from the doorway. It was not an angry voice. It was something worse. It was tired.

“Not today, Leo,” she said. She was wiping her hands on her apron. Her face was a map of worry. “There are things to do. Stay close to home.”

“But we always play,” Leo insisted, his voice small. It was the one thing they always did. The one thing that was still the same.

“There’s no point to it,” she sighed. Her gaze drifted to the horizon, to the sky that held no answers. “Silly games. It’s better to be quiet. Better to learn something useful. Miguel is helping his father with the water pump.”

She ushered Miguel inside. The boy gave Leo a helpless, apologetic look before the door closed. The other boys mumbled their excuses and drifted away, not to their own homes, but just… away. Into the shadows. Like ghosts.

Leo was left alone. He did not understand. A game was not pointless. A game was everything. It was the run, the pass, the goal. It was the future. A hundred futures, where a crowd roared his name, where his mother and father were happy, where the sad, heavy feeling was gone from the world.

The adults wanted him to grow up. They were always telling him to be serious, to learn a trade, to prepare. But prepare for what? A world with only twenty-two years left? He did not want to prepare. He wanted to play. He wanted to be a child. He wanted the fear to go away. The fear was a constant presence in their lives. It was in the way his mother held him too tight at night. It was in the way his father stared at nothing for long periods of time. It was in the hushed, urgent conversations he heard through the thin walls of their apartment after he was supposed to be asleep. Words like ‘rations,’ ‘security,’ ‘the curve.’

He walked back to the empty pitch and stood in the center. The ball was held tight in his hands. The sun bled across the sky, turning the clouds orange and pink. A beautiful, pointless sunset. He looked down at the ball, at its familiar, comforting shape. He had a dream, a bright, burning thing inside him. But a dream needed other people. It needed a team. It needed a world that believed in running towards a goal.

He dropped the ball to the ground. He nudged it with his foot. He began to dribble, his feet moving in the familiar, practiced rhythm. He imagined Carlos to his left, Rafael to his right. He imagined an opponent in front of him. He feinted, cut to the right, and accelerated towards the makeshift goal. He could hear the roar of the crowd in his head. The sound was thin and lonely against the silence of the real world.

He took the shot. The ball flew straight and true, hitting the back of the wooden frame with a satisfying thud. A perfect goal. He turned, his arms raised in triumph, to a stadium of empty air.

There was no one to see. No one to cheer. The joy of the goal was a hollow thing. A game needed to be shared.

He walked to the goal and picked up the ball. He sat down in the dust, his back against the wooden post. He hugged the ball to his chest. He did not care about theETI. He did not care about the shrinking sky. He just wanted to play. He wanted his friends back. He wanted the sadness to go away. He wanted to be a boy in a world that had time for boys to play games.

He stayed there until the colours faded from the sky and the first stars appeared, cold and distant. The silence of the pitch was absolute now. It was the sound of a game being called off, the sound of a future that had forgotten how to play. He looked up at the stars. He knew they were disappearing. The teachers had told them. But they looked the same to him. They were still there. They were still beautiful.

He did not understand why the adults had given up. The game was not over yet. There was still time on the clock. Why had they all walked off the pitch?

He stood up. He brushed the red dust from his trousers. He held the ball in his hands. He looked across the empty field. He did not want to go home. He did not want to face the quiet sadness of his parents.

He kicked the ball against the wall of a nearby building. The thud echoed in the quiet evening. He trapped the rebound with his foot. He kicked it again. Thud. Trap. Thud. Trap. A steady, lonely rhythm. A small, defiant heartbeat against the great, encroaching silence. He would not stop playing. Not yet. He would play until the final whistle. He would play until the lights went out.

Imagine this: AI just snagged your office coffee machine's prime real estate to charge its circuits—and now it's eyeing your desktop and maybe even your next promotion. Welcome to the brave new world where startups are fighting just to stay alive in the eye of the AI storm. From robot baristas brewing better lattes to code-crunchers spinning out software faster than you can say ""debug"", AI is thrusting every industry into a sci-fi reality show. 

**Can Startups Keep Pace with Tech Giants?**

In the economy's turbocharged race, startups are sprinting against AI juggernauts backed by megabucks and infinite server space. With behemoths like Google and Amazon treating server farms like lemonade stands, the question isn't if AI will disrupt but how wide the margin will be. These tech titans are spinning artificial intelligence into a yarn that knits everything from customer service chatbots to autonomous delivery drones, and they're not waiting to upstage any sluggish newcomers.

**But Wait, Isn't AI an Ally Too?**

Before you pack up the office and stream back-to-back survival shows for inspiration, consider this: AI isn't just the enemy; it's the teammate you didn't know you needed. If wielded deftly, AI can turn tedious tasks into automated machinations, letting startups transcend the mundane to innovate and strategize. It's all about finding the synergy where machines do the heavy lifting, allowing human creativity to soar.

**Is It Time to Embrace or Evade?**

The real kicker is deciding if AI is the future boss or just another tool of the trade. Does your startup artfully dodge making human redundancy lists, or is there a deft pivot where AI and ambition collaborate like Lennon and McCartney? As the digital dust settles, one thing is clear: the dialogue about where humans fit in this algorithmically managed world is just beginning.

I knew it meant something but no way in hell would i have thought that it was my psyche saying you're about to go through individuation. Then a few weeks after that dream, i had one where i met a very symbolic figure in the history of mankind... And the setting tssss. We were standing below the Golden Gate bridge.

The question? ""What has come to pass?"" Was he telling me to reflect before entering nigredo (unknowingly)? 

Then came the period I'm in now 
3/4 weeks ago i made a conscious decision that i was going to go hardcore and pursue my goals. Right before i even entered that phase i dreamt of a spider descending towards my face. I have a fear of spiders so i tell you i woke up so aggressively i nearly fell off the bed, and started looking for spiders. Came to find out that it had something to do with me running away from or abandoning my own creativity. So I started the hardcore protocol and i was loading up 5 coffees in every morning for 3 days, i was sleep deprived ofcourse. I was pushing 10 hrs of creative work until on day 4 my anima had seen it all and decided to show tf up . She walked out of a room i stayed in at 16 when i had mental issues and walked right up to me with a notepad in her hand as if she had accumulated all this information on me . She goes, ""you have a mind infection."" ?? Long story short i had heard about active imagination before so i recorded a dialogue with her . I had a vision of an observer archetype mid dialogue whom i call the London Watcher because it was me looking out of a window in london, my anima told me to draw it . 
That same day later on, i had a vision of a snake coming out of my mouth from a 3rd person perspective. I couldn't make meaning of it so i asked my anima and it told me that the snake coming out of my mouth was truth exiled . 

I need someone to break this part down for me . Then 2 days ago in a dream, i was in an ancient Egyptian city crowded with 8 feet tall giants with sphinx faces . I was walking with a group of six of them then another group walked passed us asking my group, ""are you taking him to Dogma?"" followed by ""he's not happy"" I promise to god i have never heard the word Dogma in my entire life . The tone was suggesting that this archetype had a lot of authority and the city based their beliefs around him .The dream faded when i asked them who the hell Dogma was. I just got pulled into individuation 5 days ago bro !! You're telling me I'm already being sent to confrontation with such a major archetype 

Edit : it may sound stupid, forgive me but it's still exciting to me right now. I don't feel the weight of it yet",1,1756543664.0,Jung,8,1.0,False

1n3wkt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n3wkt0/my_brother_runs_a_dysfunctional_family_and_i_have/,"My brother runs a dysfunctional family, and I have no idea what to do about it.","He is married with 4 kids aged 10, 14, 16, and 17. He works very unsociable hours which change from days to nights seemingly at random, so he doesn't see as much of his family as much as he likes. At least I hope this is the reason because despite having no academic qualifications, he is quite capable of getting a better job.

""What about his wife?"" I hear you cry.

She is about as much of a 'trad wife' as any narcassist could hope for. She has little to say about anything and happily (maybe that should be 'blindly') goes along with whatever her husband desires. Whilst my brother works all hours God sends, she sits at home cooking, cleaning and I really don't know what else. She doesn't have any hobbies or a job and so doesn't leave the house except to go to the local co-op - that I know of anyway. I have never once seen her interact positively with any of her kids except to ask them what they want for tea.

She doesn't drive despite having a license and uses that as an excuse to never take the kids out anywhere. Not even to any of the local parks 15 mins away for a play on the swings. Granted the older ones can now go alone, but thats no excuse for not taking them when they were younger.

""What about her husband?"" I hear you cry.

When he has recovered consciousness from whatever crazy shift he has done, he seems to spend every remaining hour doing jobs around the house, leaving it a building site 24/7. Once again, I have rarely seen him interacting with his kids in a positive way - though he makes *slightly* more effort than his wife. Never have either of them read to the kids, or played any games with them that I know of. Just stuck in front of a screen for emtertainment.

He has on rare occasions taken his family on days out, but only on walks around places. This happens literally twice a year max - I shit you not. He once took some of them to a theme park of sorts on holiday (not the Pleasure Beach or anything like that though), but that must have been in at least 2019, maybe even earlier.

I hope I'm painting you a vivid enough picture here. I really wish I was making this up.

Something else about my brother is that he goes through fads. And I don't mean the latest fashion trends.
He regularly decides (and then un-decides a few months to a year later) that he is allergic to everything from gluten; to alcohol; to coffee; to lactose; to red meat and anything in between. A hypochondriac, if you will. Of course it can't just be him that has developed this mysterious 'intolerance'. His whole family must follow the same dietary regimen that he does when it changes every few months. This has happened so often that I don't even bother asking anymore.
Other trends include homeschooling (despite neither him nor his wife have a GCSE between them and never employing a tutor); and the latest hobby which involves buying a lifetime supply of equipment for it and invariably selling it all again when the next fad comes along.

As you might expect, this lack of attention has led to some of his kids having... problems.
The eldest has always some mild learning difficulties, but in recent years has developed ADHD (apparently, though I'm not convinced) as well as anxiety so severe that they has never learnt to socialise with anyone except the family. Subsequently, they never leave the house except to visit me.
The second eldest is in surprisingly decent shape despite always having been blamed for the bad behaviour of the others. They are just starting a job with good career prospects and I suspect may leave home as soon as possible.
The third child seems to be going the same way as the dad who has been taken out of school for a second time to be homeschooled (i.e. plonking them in front of a computer and hoping they pass a GCSE exam in 18 months). Like any cleverdick 14 y/o, they have basically said ""balls to that"" and has since become involved in some sort of gang doing God only knows what. The way my brother talks about them, you would actually think he was proud.
The youngest is the most normal for the time being and the one I feel most sorry for. They are not quite old enough to work out what is going on at home and have been coming round to my house along with the eldest child every other day for the past couple of months, I think just to escape their madhouse. I don't have a partner or any kids, so I'm glad for the company and someone to play all my old toys with!

What I have seen build up over the years makes me sad to he core, and I have no idea what I can do for the poor kids except try to have normal interactions with them. If only to give them some respite for an hour or two a few times a week.

Some background about my brother for context:
His dad was a complete tosser towards my mum when he was growing up (not violent, just a complete waste of space) leading to them getting divorced when he was about 10 and for my mum to raise him as best she could. - I realise this technically makes him my half brother, but I find it easier to just call him my brother.
From secondary school onwards, he was a real pain in the arse. He messed around and eventually absconded from his last two years at school  supposedly getting involved with gangs and drugs (history repeating itself, much?). At this point, my mum had zero contact with him for about 5 years when he turned up one day with a girlfriend who ended up being his now wife.
His wife I know very little about, except that she seems to come from a broken home - something to do with abuse from her dad, but I don't know any details and I have never asked since its not really any of my business. Fairly certain I wouldn't be allowed to know which is fair enough, I suppose.

Is there anything I can do, or has my brother created a comlete lost cause of a family?",1,1756543084.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I did tell her I'm thankful and that I would cherish them. But they're not really useful to me.,"Okay so my birthday was days ago. I received a birthday bag from her and inside are two coffee books and perfume looking which is actually for room scent. The books: one, a sport motivational book. I don't really do sports. Two, a beagel guide book. We don't have a dog and I often mentioned to her many times I love cats. I haven't even mentioned any beagel interest to her. I don't really use room perfume because there are specific scents that makes me sick. I mean I told her thank you and I expressed that I appreciate her efforts and spending. It's just that. None of them resonated with me. She told me she'd been struggling financially and I get that but these items are pricey. She should have atleast gotten cheaper items that I would like/use. After I received it, I didn't want to ruin MY bday, I just moved on and displayed the things on my table as my appreciation that she gave me something.

But as days go by, I felt like she doesn't really care about me or my interests. We're really close and I know being like this with an age gap is kind of bitchy of me. But this happens like alot to me during birthdays and Christmas gifting. I would literally be happier with a $1 thrifted bracelet than a beagel book.

I know she's very young but I've always been the one to spoil her anything. I gave her free items even when there's no occasion. During her birthdays/graduation/christmas, I gift her expensive bags, perfumes, jewelries etc. I'm not saying she should reciprocate equally.  

I'm just saying she could've atleast gifted items I would use/resonate with me. I don't care if it's hand me downs or how cheap they are. But I had been unintentionally expressing my interests everytime we hang out. I love cats. I like to journal. I love movies. I love to read romance books. I like jewelries.

It just felt like she was obligated to give me something because I was very generous of giving her stuff. So she threw in that gift bag anything, never caring about if I would like it. The perfume looking one was the takeaway that she didn't even read the labels. She thought it was a perfume for the body. She was also shocked as me that it was a room scenter. For the beagel book, i don't get why would give one to me. I don't understand. It had a tear or damage on the cover. 

Okay so that has been bugging me for days and so I had a gentle talk with her. I told her I appreciate the gifting effort. I expressed how I would like it if she gifted items that resonates with me. And she tries to justify the things she brought for me is right and that she explained how she thinks they resonate me just fine.

This also happens last years too. She often gifts me items that is not me. Like something I'd never use. 

I share her my thoughts and feelings about it. But she was upset that those items were pricey and I'm being an ungrateful bitch. 

I mean yeah but like I told her afterwards that I'm still thankful she thought of buying things. Idk anymore.

AITA?

For me personally, I have spent quite a long time living in Georgia (the country) and there are some food and drink that is pretty unique to this country or other former Soviet countries.

1) Kvass (квас) I didn’t know what this was for a very long time. I would see the grandmothers in summer sitting under an umbrella next to a big yellow tank, pouring a brown substance into a plastic cup. I finally tried it one day and now I’m totally hooked. It’s basically fermented rye bread and sugar from my understanding.

2) Raf coffee (раф кофе) is a creamy sweet coffee with a single shot of espresso with cream and vanilla sugar which is thoroughly foamed. My Belarusian friend introduced me to this coffee and now it’s my favorite coffee. It’s origins are from Russia, but I’m sure you can find it in an former Soviet country

3) Shoti bread (შოთი) in every city there are bakeries that make fresh shoti bread from a clay oven. For 1 GEL you can take fresh hot bread straight from the oven. It enough to feed a couple people. It’s soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. 

4) Nadughi cheese (ნადუგი) this presentation of this cheese is interesting and the cheese itself is my absolute favorite. It’s a white cheese similar to cottage cheese or ricotta aromatized with peppermint. Then it’s wrapped in thin slices of Sulguni cheese which resembles mozzarella and then wrapped in a cone shape.

I ran down a rabbit hole and, wow, it did not disappoint. Not gonna lie, I’m kinda SHOCKED these positions even exist and that you can actually work in your PJs, fully remote—and set your own hours??!  

What parallel universe did I just enter? Did I wake up too early, or didn't the “work from anywhere” dream jobs only exist on Instagram a week ago?  
Nope. It’s 100% real, and these 10 companies are already hiring for next year. YES, 2025, so you’ve got time.  

Here’s where my brain does a backflip: I found this crazy resource ( **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** ) that not only lists these roles but explains how testing actual apps can be way more chill than you’d ever think. Like, one hour of reviewing a new app while sipping coffee, and BOOM, you’re paid.  
Is...is that allowed??   

Anyway, let’s break it down:  

- **Zapier** — Not just automation, they want real humans (you & me!) testing workflows AND mobile features.
- **GoodNovel** — Plot twist: Not only can you read stories on their app, but work as a beta tester via **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** .
- **Testlio** — Crowd-testing meets flexibility. Sign up, pick your own gigs, get paid. You’ll be legit helping big brands launch apps!
- **UserTesting** — You literally get to say what you really think about new apps. Pay per test, fully remote.
- **uTest** — Massive global network. Set your schedule, choose what you test. Side hustle potential is INSANE.
- **Applause** — Heard about them for app + web bug bounty testing. Pay seems way higher for mobile!
- **Rainforest QA** — No dev experience? No biggie. They want fresh eyes to break stuff (intentionally!).
- **Testbirds** — “Explore new apps and tech before anyone else.” I KNOW.
- **Lionbridge** — Surprised at how many flexible testing roles they post.
- **Alten Group** — Euro vibes, remote roles, English-first, super open to new testers.

And yes, I know what you’re thinking:  
How are THESE companies all looking to PAY people just to click around an app, hunt for bugs, or just rant about clunky UX? I kept refreshing my tabs thinking this was a prank.

The best (absolute wildest) part? All from **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** where half these links are hiding in plain sight.  
Why is nobody TALKING about this? Why didn’t my career counselor mention this remote goldmine?  
Oh, and—just putting it here ONE more time because CLEARLY this is the holy grail: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

Would anyone else actually do this for their main gig?  
Or am I just dumbfounded at how easy this sounds? 😅

1n3wfk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1n3wfk2/how_do_i_leave_my_dad/,How do I leave my dad?,"Hey, I'm not sure how to start this but I've basically been abused for as long as i remember. I used to have a two parent household and I can barely think about how life could've been before my dad started becoming violent. I was only 6 when he really started changing. I don't know what it was but my mom said a switch flipped one day. She was never married to him and eventually left me and my siblings with him. There's been many people who tried to pick up on what he used to do but nothing ever changed. When I was a kid my dad used to break all my toys and knock down my shelves if my room wasn't cleaned and scream at us until it was fixed. He hit, dragged and kicked me several times from ages 6-14. There's been times where's he's dragged me by my hair out my bed and onto the floor before he kicked me until I felt like I couldn't breathe or move. The next weekend over I came to school with a black eye and no one cared. He got me kitten though so I guess I got over it. One time he did this because my sister and I got into a physical fight and he said if we wanted a fight then he'd show us one. My sister got a similar punishment that night but he kept going back in forth to our rooms to even it out I guess. Not sure what he thinks. 
From what I heard he's been horrifically abused in his own childhood and even molested by his own step mother. I had sympathy for him at some point but it's long gone. I try not to feel bad for him ever since my mom left, she left because he was doing the same thing to her but my sister actually called the police when she was just 15 instead I hid and begged her to stop before we got in trouble. Now i'm 19 and my sister recently moved out because her live in boyfriend who actually did a lot for our family, finally spoke up to my dad after months of him verbally abusing my sister. He finally snapped the day before her birthday and told him off which promptly got them kicked out with a baby on the way. Now it's just me and my baby brother who's only 11. I don't want to leave him but it's getting harder to deal with the constant verbal abuse. It wasn't physical like when i was younger, although it's starting up again with my brother. He doesn't get anything like I did just the smacking or occasional belt if he's bad and I may add that my brother does have behavior issues so it's about once in every three months he gets a real one. 

Anyway, he tried scaring me today because I stood my ground after his dog peed on my bed and he blamed me for not having a mattress protector. I barely came back from work 10-7 shift and I was exhausted but all i thought about was taking my brother home a chicken sandwich. I was just gonna give him the food and go to bed. But as I was walking up the stairs he told me get the soap from downstairs. He never told me she peed on my bed so as i'm going up our condo stairs then slowly into my room, i notice and come to ask about it. He kept trying to tell me it's living learn lesson and I needed to lock my door and clean it up asap because all he was spray fabuloso on it. and I said no, the lesson is where you take care of your own dog and don't have her in my fucking room. You should clean it. He didn't like what I had to say and tried arguing with me but I was too tired so I went to go cry in the kitchen. He got mad I was loudly crying and at that point he was yelling at me to tell him why. I told him why does it matter? You don't care. And he got more mad I wouldn't go talk to him so I let it be until he started arguing with me calling me names and I couldn't stop replying back. I couldn't stop looking him in eye as he got more mad and screamed. I hated all these years where he thinks he's the winner. I hate him. I just screamed back that I'm not fucking stupid I'm not insecure or scared. But I was. I didn't show it even when he got up and screamed in my face then tried throwing the coffee table my way. He corned me in the kitchen and got in my face even stepping on my shoes and breaking my toenail from the sheer weight of his diabetic ass. He pushed me back into the table and told me to I was stupid for talking back and I didn't know when to shut up. Alongside names like airhead, idiot, moron, brat and the b word. He even tried calling me my mom's name.  I just didn't care. He told me i should've stopped after he called me by her name like it was such an insult. The worst thing I could've been called was him. I was packing my stuff to go but he said if i even wanted to go for the night I had to leave for good. I couldn't talk to my brother ever again or be around. I couldn't get my stuff either and have to surrender my key forever. He knew the exact words to manipulate me and I know. Guys I know. But I can't give up my brother. I called my sister, mom, brother in law and my boyfriend and we came up with a plan. But it'll never happen.

I watched it so much throughout the years. Not so much lately, I think I don’t want to associate it with what I’m going through right now. But it still does bring peace and comfort.

Aldi has a four pack. They’re pretty cute. So I picked those up. Their coffee cup-esque.

Anyway, what I wanna know is what lessons have you learned from the girls? I guess it doesn’t have to just be the girls. It can be anyone from the show. Emily especially has great advice.

I’ve been dealing with this bs for over a year.

My symptoms have been very severe (horrible cramps, diarrhoea, fatigue, brain fog, anxiety, depression)

Mark pimentel says 10% of people with SIBO wont respond to prokinetics at all especially if anti vinculin is high.

Also done the trio smart breath test and am awaiting results.

Yet, I was able to have a full cup of coffee after 7 months of hell.

Over the past 7 months, it seemed like no matter what I did, nothing worked.

What I did recently:

1. Got off the amitriptyline- didnt do shit for me. Doctor straight up doesnt know what he’s doing.

2. Started BPC-157 + TB500 500mcg injections daily

3. Lvlup ultimate GI repair daily (trying to titrate up to 2x / day)

4. Florastor Probiotic (saccharomyces boulardii) daily

5. Megasporebiotic daily (spore based)

6. TTFD daily

I literally only just started with this combination and my goodness I feel 1 million times better.

Will implement rifaximin course after I get back the breath test results and start prucalopride 0.5mg nightly tmr.

Also will add on vivomixx probiotics when my stomach settles more (slow reintroduction is key)

This is not to forgo the fact that I:

1. Meditate twice daily

2. Clock in sufficient steps

3. Keep stress levels low by staying off social media and journaling

4.Try to sleep 7-8h per night

5. Space meals 4-5 h apart and 12h overnight

6. Have been on low fodmap for god knows how long to quell symptoms.

For desert and coffee I thought Subko would be great. But we'll be reaching there by 6pm(remember its a friday) and I dont want to wait or hear that the place is full(all the discussion bout subko I've read has told me that the place is always overcrowded) 

So like is it okay to reserve a table at a cafe?(etiquette wise?) And for how long can we hang around there for? Is 2 hrs acceptable? 

Also my boyfriend really wanted to do a clay-date but neither of our houses are free that day so I was thinking we could do that in the cafe? Is subko chill for that or are we going to be kicked out? Should I call them up and ask before hand about it? And if subko is not the place for that, can you suggest me other chill places in bandra where we can do that?

Picture this: You're working on a project, feeling confident and capable, when suddenly someone appears over your shoulder, questioning every decision, suggesting ""better"" ways to do things, and essentially turning your smooth workflow into a stressful obstacle course. Sound familiar? 🤔

Whether it's a family member who insists on reorganizing your kitchen ""their way,"" a colleague who needs to approve every email you send, or a team leader who checks your progress every fifteen minutes, we've all encountered the Control Enthusiast – someone whose need to oversee and direct others can transform any environment into a pressure cooker.

## Understanding the Control Enthusiast Mind 🧠

Before diving into solutions, let's decode what drives these individuals. Control Enthusiasts aren't necessarily malicious people plotting to make your life difficult. Often, they operate from:

**Fear of Poor Outcomes**: They genuinely believe that without their constant input, things will go wrong. This anxiety drives them to hover and intervene repeatedly.

**Past Negative Experiences**: Perhaps they've witnessed projects fail when they weren't directly involved, creating a mental pattern that equates their absence with disaster.

**Perfectionist Tendencies**: They have specific standards and struggle to trust that others can meet these standards without detailed guidance.

**Lack of Confidence in Others**: This isn't always arrogance – sometimes they simply haven't seen enough evidence that others can deliver quality results independently.

**Personal Insecurity**: Ironically, some Control Enthusiasts feel most secure when they're actively managing situations, even if this creates stress for everyone involved.

## The Relationship-First Approach 🤝

The most effective strategy begins with building a foundation of trust and understanding, rather than immediately pushing back against their behavior.

**Acknowledge Their Expertise**: Start conversations by recognizing their knowledge and experience. ""I value your insights on this type of project"" can open doors that confrontation would slam shut.

**Demonstrate Reliability**: Consistency becomes your best friend. When you consistently deliver what you promise, when you promise it, their need to check up on you naturally diminishes.

**Communicate Proactively**: Instead of waiting for them to ask for updates, provide regular progress reports. This satisfies their need for information while maintaining your autonomy.

**Ask for Their Input Strategically**: Rather than rejecting their suggestions, invite their expertise at specific moments. ""I'd love your thoughts on this particular aspect"" shows respect while maintaining boundaries.

## Setting Boundaries Without Building Walls 🚧

Effective boundary-setting with Control Enthusiasts requires finesse. Direct confrontation often triggers their anxiety and increases controlling behavior.

**Use the Collaboration Language**: Instead of ""You're micromanaging me,"" try ""I work best when I have some space to implement your excellent suggestions. How about we check in at these specific intervals?""

**Propose Alternative Systems**: Offer structured ways for them to stay informed that don't involve constant interruption. ""Would a daily summary email work better than multiple check-ins throughout the day?""

**Create Mutual Agreements**: Work together to establish expectations. ""Let's agree that I'll update you every Tuesday and Friday, and you can reach out if something urgent comes up.""

**Show Results Through Freedom**: When given space, make sure you deliver exceptional results. Nothing convinces a Control Enthusiast to loosen their grip like consistent evidence that independence produces quality outcomes.

## Practical Daily Strategies 💼

**The Buffer Technique**: Build extra time into your estimates. If a task takes two hours, tell them it will take three. This creates space for their ""improvements"" without derailing your schedule.

**The Options Method**: Instead of presenting one solution, offer two or three alternatives. This satisfies their need to choose and direct while keeping you in control of the viable options.

**The Progress Documentation**: Keep detailed records of your work process and results. When they question your methods, you have concrete evidence of your effectiveness.

**The Preemptive Strike**: Address their likely concerns before they voice them. ""I know you might be worried about the timeline, so I've built in extra buffer time for revisions.""

## When You're the Family Member 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Family dynamics add extra complexity because relationships are permanent and emotionally charged.

**Choose Your Battles**: Not every controlling behavior needs to be addressed immediately. Focus on situations that significantly impact your well-being or important decisions.

**Use Love as Your Opening**: ""I know you care about me and want things to go well, which is why I'd like to find a way we can both feel comfortable with how we handle this.""

**Create Win-Win Solutions**: Look for compromises that respect their need for involvement while preserving your autonomy. Maybe they help with planning while you handle execution.

**Model the Behavior You Want**: Demonstrate trust in their abilities and avoid controlling their choices. Sometimes leading by example creates positive change.

## Professional Environment Tactics 💻

**Document Everything**: Keep records of conversations, decisions, and results. This protects you and provides concrete evidence of your competence.

**Build Alliances**: Cultivate relationships with other team members and stakeholders who can vouch for your capabilities and work style.

**Focus on Results**: Make your success undeniable. When your outcomes consistently meet or exceed expectations, it becomes harder to justify excessive oversight.

**Seek Feedback from Others**: If possible, get input from other supervisors or colleagues about your work quality. This provides perspective and potentially influential voices supporting your independence.

## The Long-Game Approach 🎯

Real change with Control Enthusiasts happens gradually through consistent demonstration of trustworthiness and competence.

**Celebrate Small Freedoms**: When they give you space and things go well, acknowledge it positively. ""Thanks for trusting me with that project – it felt great to have the autonomy to approach it my way.""

**Learn Their Triggers**: Pay attention to what specifically makes them anxious and address those concerns proactively.

**Share Success Stories**: When your independent work leads to positive outcomes, make sure they're aware of the connection between freedom and results.

**Be Patient with Setbacks**: They may revert to controlling behavior during stressful periods. View this as temporary rather than permanent regression.

## Advanced Psychological Approaches 🎭

**The Reverse Psychology Method**: Sometimes expressing understanding of their position can paradoxically reduce their need to assert it. ""I understand why you'd want to oversee this closely – it's important that it goes well.""

**The Consultant Technique**: Frame their input as expert consultation rather than management. ""I'd value your consultant's perspective on this challenge"" changes the dynamic entirely.

**The Teaching Opportunity**: Ask them to mentor you in their areas of expertise. This satisfies their need to be involved while positioning you as a willing learner rather than a resistant subordinate.

**The Graduated Independence**: Negotiate for increasing levels of autonomy based on demonstrated success. Start with small projects and build up to larger responsibilities.

## What NOT to Do ❌

**Avoid Direct Confrontation**: Telling someone they're a Control Enthusiast rarely improves the situation and often escalates tension.

**Don't Take It Personally**: Their behavior typically stems from their own anxieties rather than judgments about your abilities.

**Resist the Urge to Rebel**: Passive-aggressive responses or deliberate defiance usually backfire and justify their controlling behavior in their minds.

**Don't Complain to Others First**: Address issues directly with the person when possible, rather than building coalitions against them.

## Creating Sustainable Change 🌱

The goal isn't to eliminate their involvement entirely – often their expertise and perspective genuinely add value. Instead, aim to channel their contributions in ways that enhance rather than hinder your effectiveness.

**Regular Relationship Maintenance**: Schedule periodic conversations about how your working relationship is functioning and what adjustments might benefit both of you.

**Acknowledge Their Positive Impact**: When their input genuinely improves outcomes, make sure they know you recognize and appreciate their contribution.

**Model Collaborative Behavior**: Show them what effective teamwork looks like by being consultative in your own approach while maintaining appropriate boundaries.

**Stay Professional and Kind**: Regardless of frustrations, maintaining respect and professionalism creates the best environment for positive change.

## Building Your Own Confidence 💪

Sometimes the most powerful tool for dealing with Control Enthusiasts is strengthening your own sense of competence and self-assurance.

**Develop Your Skills**: The more genuinely capable you become, the easier it is to earn trust and independence.

**Practice Clear Communication**: Improve your ability to articulate your thoughts, plans, and progress clearly and confidently.

**Learn from Their Expertise**: Extract genuine value from their knowledge while maintaining your boundaries.

**Build Your Support Network**: Cultivate relationships with people who recognize and appreciate your independent capabilities.

## The Path Forward 🛤️

Remember that changing relationship dynamics takes time, patience, and consistent effort. The goal isn't to ""win"" against the Control Enthusiast, but to create a more balanced and mutually satisfying way of working together.

Focus on small, consistent improvements rather than dramatic confrontations. Celebrate progress, even when it's incremental. Most importantly, maintain your own well-being and professional growth while navigating these challenging dynamics.

Whether you're dealing with an overly involved parent, a micromanaging boss, or a controlling teammate, these strategies can help you maintain your autonomy while preserving important relationships. The key is patience, consistency, and a commitment to finding solutions that work for everyone involved.

Your independence and peace of mind are worth the effort required to create healthier boundaries. With time and the right approach, even the most enthusiastic controllers can learn to trust your capabilities and give you the space you need to thrive.

*Ever met someone who turns every mistake into someone else's fault? Welcome to the world of blame-shifters.*

---

## 🤔 What Makes Someone a Responsibility-Dodger?

Picture this: The project deadline is missed, the kitchen is messy, or the team target isn't met. Instead of owning up, certain people immediately point fingers elsewhere. Sound familiar?

These individuals have mastered the art of deflection. They're not necessarily bad people - they've just developed a habit that protects their ego but damages relationships and productivity.

**Common behaviors you'll recognize:**
- Always finding external reasons for problems
- Making others feel guilty for things they didn't do
- Twisting conversations to avoid accountability
- Playing victim when confronted
- Never apologizing genuinely

---

## 🏠 At Home: Managing Family Dynamics

### The Kitchen Scenario
When dirty dishes pile up and your family member claims ""I was too busy"" or ""Someone else used more dishes,"" here's what works:

**🎯 The Documentation Approach**
Keep it simple. Don't argue about who did what. Instead, create clear expectations:
- ""Going forward, whoever cooks cleans their dishes within 2 hours""
- Focus on solutions, not blame battles

**🎯 The Natural Consequences Method**
Let reality do the teaching. If someone doesn't take responsibility for their laundry, they deal with having no clean clothes. No lectures needed.

**🎯 The Broken Record Technique**
When they start deflecting: ""I understand, and the dishes still need to be done."" Repeat calmly. Don't get pulled into their drama.

### Dealing with Kids Who Dodge Responsibility
Children often blame siblings, pets, or ""accidents"" for everything. Transform this pattern early:

**Instead of:** ""Why didn't you clean your room?""
**Try:** ""What's your plan for getting your room ready before dinner?""

This shifts focus from excuses to solutions.

## 💼 In the Workplace: Professional Strategies

### The Meeting Room Reality
Nothing derails productivity faster than team members who won't own their mistakes. Here's your toolkit:

**🎯 The Evidence-Based Approach**
- Document everything important via email
- Use phrases like ""As we discussed"" and ""To confirm our agreement""
- Keep records of deadlines and commitments

**🎯 The Redirect Strategy**
When someone starts blaming others in meetings:
- ""Let's focus on moving forward""
- ""What can we do differently next time?""
- ""How do we solve this now?""

**🎯 The Boundary Setting Method**
Be clear about your role: ""I'm responsible for X, you handle Y. If Y isn't done, that's not my area to fix.""

### Managing Up with a Blame-Shifting Boss
This requires extra finesse:
- Always follow up verbal instructions with email confirmations
- CC relevant people when appropriate
- Focus on solutions when problems arise
- Never take the bait when they try to make their problems yours

---

## 👥 In Teams: Creating Accountability Culture

### The Group Project Phenomenon
Whether it's a work team, sports group, or community organization, blame-shifters can poison the atmosphere. Combat this:

**🎯 The Clear Roles Strategy**
- Define who does what before starting
- Set specific deadlines for individual tasks
- Create check-in points along the way

**🎯 The Public Commitment Method**
Have people state their commitments in front of others. Social pressure works wonders for accountability.

**🎯 The Progress Tracking System**
Use simple tools to track who's doing what. Transparency reduces finger-pointing.

---

## 🧠 Understanding the Psychology Behind the Behavior

### Why People Shift Blame
It's rarely malicious. Most blame-shifters are driven by:
- Fear of looking incompetent
- Perfectionist tendencies that make mistakes feel catastrophic
- Past experiences where admitting fault led to harsh consequences
- Low self-esteem that can't handle being wrong

### The Protection Mechanism
Their brain literally protects them from feeling bad by finding external reasons for problems. Understanding this helps you respond with less frustration.

---

## 🛠️ Your Daily Action Plan

### Morning Mindset
Start each day knowing you might encounter deflection. Prepare mentally:
- Remind yourself: their behavior isn't about you
- Plan your key phrases for redirecting conversations
- Focus on what you can control

### During Interactions
**✅ Do:**
- Stay calm and factual
- Focus on solutions
- Set clear boundaries
- Document important agreements

**❌ Don't:**
- Take their bait and argue about the past
- Try to change their personality
- Make it personal
- Enable their behavior by fixing their mistakes

### Evening Reflection
Ask yourself:
- Did I maintain my boundaries today?
- What worked well in difficult conversations?
- Where can I improve my approach tomorrow?

---

## 🎯 Advanced Techniques for Persistent Cases

### The Consequence Connection Method
Help them see the real impact of their behavior:
""When deadlines are missed and no one takes ownership, the whole team has to work overtime. How do you think we should handle this differently?""

### The Future Focus Technique
Instead of rehashing what went wrong:
""What systems can we put in place to prevent this issue next time?""

### The Empathy Bridge Approach
Acknowledge their perspective while maintaining your position:
""I understand you had challenges with the timeline, and we still need to deliver quality work to our clients.""

---

## 🌟 Building Long-Term Solutions

### Creating Accountability Systems
Whether at home, work, or in groups, establish:
- Clear expectations upfront
- Regular check-ins on commitments
- Fair consequences for not following through
- Recognition for taking responsibility

### Modeling the Behavior You Want
- Admit your own mistakes quickly
- Show how to take responsibility gracefully
- Demonstrate problem-solving focus over blame-finding

### Teaching Others
Share these techniques with family members, colleagues, and friends. The more people understand how to handle blame-shifters, the less power these behaviors have.

---

## 🚨 When to Walk Away

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, the relationship becomes too toxic:
- They never change despite consistent boundaries
- Your mental health suffers from constant deflection
- Their behavior actively harms others
- You find yourself becoming like them

In professional settings, document everything and involve HR when necessary. In personal relationships, consider reducing contact or seeking professional help.

---

## 💪 Protecting Your Own Sanity

### Daily Self-Care
- Remember: you can't control others, only your response
- Celebrate small wins when you handle situations well
- Don't internalize their attempts to make everything your fault

### Building Resilience
- Practice phrases you'll use in difficult conversations
- Develop hobbies and relationships outside the problematic dynamic
- Learn to laugh at the absurdity of some blame-shifting attempts

### Support Networks
Connect with others who understand:
- Find people who take responsibility for their actions
- Share strategies that work
- Get perspective when you start doubting yourself

---

## 🎭 The Bigger Picture

Dealing with blame-shifters isn't just about managing difficult people - it's about creating environments where accountability thrives and everyone can do their best work.

Every time you refuse to engage in blame games and redirect toward solutions, you're making the world a little bit better. You're showing others a different way to handle problems.

### Your Ripple Effect
- Kids learn from watching how you handle responsibility
- Colleagues notice when you focus on solutions
- Friends appreciate your steady, drama-free approach
- Communities benefit from your leadership style

---

## 🔄 Making It Stick

### Week 1: Awareness
Notice blame-shifting patterns in your daily life. Don't try to change anything yet - just observe.

### Week 2: Boundaries
Practice saying ""That's not my responsibility"" and ""Let's focus on solutions"" in low-stakes situations.

### Week 3: Documentation
Start keeping simple records of important commitments and agreements.

### Week 4: Consistency
Apply your new approaches consistently, even when it feels awkward.

### Month 2 and Beyond
Refine your techniques based on what works in your specific situations.

---

## 🎯 Remember This

You're not trying to fix blame-shifters - you're protecting yourself and creating better dynamics for everyone involved. Sometimes the best thing you can do is show them a different way through your own actions.

The goal isn't to win arguments or prove points. It's to maintain your sanity, get things done, and create environments where responsible people can thrive.

**Your new superpower:** Staying focused on solutions while others get lost in blame games.

Start today. Pick one technique from this guide and use it the next time you encounter deflection or finger-pointing. Notice how it changes the entire dynamic of the conversation.

You've got this! 🌟
