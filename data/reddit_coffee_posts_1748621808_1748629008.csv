My former fianc√© put a Molotov cocktail in a bag full of my belongings, along with a handwritten, signed note admitting to constructing the device with a veiled threat. After his arrest, he has gone online calling me a murderer and abuser, in a desperate attempt to worm out of the felony charges. Additionally, I worry he‚Äôs doing this to hurt my business and possibly recruit someone to harm me and my family. 

He has sexually harassed several times since we‚Äôve broken up, including sending two unsolicited nudes, admitted in text message to vandalizing a car, and  refuses to give back a cell phone I own, my great grandfather‚Äôs desk, and the engagement ring which was the first diamond ring my grandfather ever bought my grandmother. 

I‚Äôve had to quit my new job because I realized the office was half a block from a coffee shop he frequents, and I was worried if he saw me, it could endanger the entire office. 

I‚Äôve filed reports, but I feel like the sexual harassment, larceny, libel, and financial damages are getting downplayed because he‚Äôs a femme transmasc and I‚Äôm a masc nonbinary. I‚Äôm not sure if I should try to take those things up in civil court, especially since the estimated value of goods he stole is over $6000. 

Unfortunately , this situation has left me financially unstable, so I haven‚Äôt been able to hire a lawyer. Any advice on how to approach this situation would be greatly appreciated.",1,1748628908.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

I wanted to talk about my experiences with recruitment and wanted to ask for advice. I've applied to various jobs over the past 4 years of university and have gotten some experience in fields that I want to work in, mostly from part time jobs and my own freelancing. However, I tried really hard to get internships in marketing and HR. I've done the coffee chats with professionals thing, reaching out to people in my network, cold applied; literally everything we're told to do. And I've gotten close a few times. One time, a newer tech company once had me in their final round interviews, and then I was rejected from the job. Checked for months to see if anybody got the position and I only found out that the company restructured when I met a recruiter from said company during a school career conference. They told me that people in HQ, which was across the country, heard about my situation, that I was supposed to get the job, and how it was ""so unfortunate"". Recently, I had the opportunity to do my final round interview for a big company, something I was super grateful about. I was one of the last two applicants they were considering. Totally bombed the second interview and didn't get the job but learned a lot from the experience.

I'm clearly a capable worker if I'm able to get into these interviews and companies are interested (if I'm not automatically rejected haha). Now it's my last year of university and I'm not sure if it's worth applying for Fall 2025 internships or if I would have more luck applying to FT positions after uni (with just part time marketing jobs around campus, freelancing, and no internship experience?). It's been a really disappointing experience to feel so close to getting multiple jobs but then not being able to close on a contract. The job market has just been getting worse and worse and I can't help but feel super nervous as I approach my last year.

Hi everyone! I was in Paris for the French Open in late May and treated myself to the full lunch tasting at Anona (their only Michelin star). I went all-in on the biggest menu with the wine pairing, and the bill came to just under ‚Ç¨400.

Below are the dishes I photographed‚Äîfeel free to scroll through and let me know which one looks the most tempting!

1. **Gazpacho, Lettuce, Kiwi, Cucumber & Cream of Artichoke** A bright, vegetal starter with a surprising sweet-tart note from the kiwi. The artichoke cream tied it all together.
2. **P√£o de Queijo with Comt√© Cream** Warm, cheesy Brazilian-style rolls paired with a velvety Comt√© foam. Comfort food elevated.
3. **Pigeon Leg with Mayo & ‚ÄúHot‚Äù Sauce** Crispy, juicy pigeon leg served with a surprisingly light, tangy aioli and house-made hot sauce that had real kick.
4. **Cep & Walnut ‚ÄúBeurre Noisette‚Äù with Torr√©fi√© Coffee** Earthy cep mushrooms and toasted walnuts in nut-brown butter, finished with a touch of coffee aroma (the waiter called it ‚Äútorrified‚Äù coffee).
5. **Oysters, Seawater Emulsion, Cream, Lobster Juice & Peanuts** A briny-buttery interplay‚Äîoysters topped with a silky seawater emulsion, luscious lobster jus, and a sprinkle of crushed peanuts for crunch.
6. **Deconstructed Strawberry shortcake with Strawberry Vinaigrette** Pure, seasonal strawberry sweetness brightened by a tangy strawberry-vinaigrette drizzle.
7. **Egg Mimosa, Parsley Jelly & Parsley Sorbet** A playful riff on deviled egg meets herb garden: fragmented yolk ‚Äúmimosa‚Äù crumbles, shimmering parsley gel√©e, and an icy parsley sorbet.
8. **Pigeon Filet with Fried Squash** Back for more pigeon‚Äîtender breast this time, perfectly pink, accompanied by subtly sweet fried squash",3,1748628411.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

1kzb38p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kzb38p/charlotte_dobre_videos_have_inspired_me_to_tell/,Charlotte Dobre videos have inspired me to tell some of my insane life stories - I can‚Äôt make this sh*t up - here‚Äôs story #1 - born into a polygamous family,"I‚Äôm brand new to joining Reddit myself after years of reading other people‚Äôs stories/drama/AITAH stories etc so this may not be written well being my first ever attempt at telling a story, but I‚Äôm gonna try!

So I (f33) am the youngest of all my siblings. My family tree is more like a grove rather than a singular tree. Imma take you back to the beginning. 

My mom met my dad when she was 16 and he was 24 - already some issues there screaming of red flags but it was the late 70s so more acceptable back then I guess? My mom was a quiet small town girl who was 11 years younger than any of her siblings who had all grown up and moved out when she was very young so she didn‚Äôt have a whole lot of guidance and her parents were seniors already. My dad was a grown ass man who dealt substances to the bikers in the city he lived, and he was a black belt in karate with a lot of charisma and made mom feel safe and protected, and thus began their relationship. 

At 19yo my mother gave birth to my oldest brother - we can call him John. My mom was a SAH mom as my dad wouldn‚Äôt allow her to work and she needed to look after the house and any children. My dad kind of worked, but it was mostly his dealing and driving jobs that funded their home. Some years into the relationship one of my dad‚Äôs jobs was to drive exotic dancers to and from work in order to keep them safe from predators (isn‚Äôt my dad one of those though?). He began a relationship with one of these ladies, let‚Äôs call her Tina, and eventually she moved in with my mom, dad and brother John. Tina also had 2 children that she brought with her, Tammy and Joey, who were 1 and 2 years younger than John. I know it‚Äôs kind of confusing but I hope you‚Äôre still following along - there‚Äôs now 3 parents and 3 children in the house. 

Eventually my mom was pregnant with her 2nd child, my brother Bob. Right around the time that she was giving birth to him, Tina got pregnant with my half-brother Ace. During the pregnancy with Ace, my dad got another woman pregnant with my half-sister - who was never claimed by my dad so she‚Äôs still blissfully unaware she belongs to this circus - and a couple months after she was born, I came into this world. 

So once I came into the picture my mom and Tina each had 3 children, meaning we were now a household of 3 parents and 6 children. I remember seeing a video of my first birthday and it was chaos and there was only our family there - I was 1, Ace was 1y8mo, Bob was 2y5mo, Joey was 8y, Tammy was 9y, and John was 10y. It was literal chaos. 

I really didn‚Äôt know any of this was weird growing up because it was what I was born into, but I was old enough to remember that Tina and her children had the upstairs of the duplex we lived in and we lived downstairs and my dad just stayed wherever he wanted any given night. All of Tina‚Äôs children I absolutely consider my siblings still to this day. 

In the 90‚Äôs (which is when I was born) my parents appeared on a couple of talk shows to talk about their relationship dynamic and it was one of the first such stories aired on public television at the time. I have looked high and low for those episodes but have never found them - no it was not Jerry Springer, but it probably should have been. 

There was a fair bit of drama over those years and it makes for pretty good stories to tell people now. These parents are all still alive and some of them may not appreciate their roles in my stories and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve chosen Reddit to disclose them to so that it hopefully doesn‚Äôt trace back to me. 

Some snapshots of those stories that I remember (or have been told) are:

- Tina took off across the country with Ace so that dad would chase her down and bring her back. During that time, she left my mom with Tammy and Joey, and had a lovely weekend away with my dad all to herself. 

- My mom and dad opened a dojo and taught karate, my mom also became a black belt and my dad would threaten people saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get my wife to kick your ass‚Äù while simultaneously breaking my mother down to believe she was worthless. She broke his nose twice. 

- the SWAT team came through our house twice - the first time I was a small baby, the police were threatening to shoot our dog so my mom stood, with me in her arms, between the gun and the dog (my moms kinda a badass - but also wtf?). The second time the SWAT team came through was just after my 4th bday and at that point my mom finally had enough and kicked my dad and Tina out. 

My dad then moved 4 hours away and since mom didn‚Äôt drive it was a couple years before we saw him. I didn‚Äôt really know who he was when we moved closer to him and I saw him for the first time then. My dad and Tina had a very volatile relationship with substance use, physical abuse etc. My dad moved in with his sick mom and met my step-mother (dun dun duuuuuuunnnnn) which  there will be many future stories about! 

My mom met my step dad when I was 6 and they eventually got married. We had a much more stable home, financial security but it was still volatile, we lived our childhoods walking on eggshells and eventually secretly slipping ‚Äúhappy medicine‚Äù into his coffee to hopefully have better days with him. We survived and Bob and I are very grateful for the work ethic instilled in us because of him and attribute our being functional adults to being raised with him rather than our dad. 

And there we have it. The very first story of my Reddit life - beginning with the early years of my childhood trauma - with much more to come! Stay tuned! 

If you enjoyed this read, please let me know! Like I said, I‚Äôm brand new to this and although I have a lot of trauma I am an open book and I‚Äôm not really pained by these stories! I am hoping you find some entertainment in it as I do! ",3,1748628315.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Millions of Americans depend on both programs for their healthcare needs, and working Americans have paid into them through taxes deducted on every paycheck. The trillions of dollars saved would then be used to offset even larger tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.

‚ÄúHere are the facts. You can‚Äôt cure old age. Old people are going to die whether they have Medicare or not. Most children on Medicaid are healthy enough to get good paying factory jobs,‚Äù Ernst said at a press conference announcing her bill. ‚ÄúBy eliminating Medicare and Medicaid entirely, we can eliminate taxes on the wealthiest Americans, and that means job security for literally dozens of Americans employed as luxury yacht manufacturers, landscape architects, construction builders of vast underground bunkers in our national parks, and as manufacturers of doilies made out of real lace instead of cheap paper so our coffee doesn‚Äôt stain our imported Clusoni Scoop Calacatta Oro tables.‚Äù

Republican representatives and senators were unreserved in praising the bill. ‚ÄúAs Americans, we can all agree that getting rid of the onerous tax burden faced by me and my fellow elected officials is the most important thing we can do to make America great again,‚Äù said senate majority leader John Thune.

Many staunch supporters of president Donald Trump were more hesitant in supporting the measure. As Iowa resident Gary-Joe Wayne Johnson said, ‚ÄúNo question losing all my healthcare is going to hurt a lot. If I have to go a week without my medicine, I'll be dead. But as long as it owns the libs, I guess I‚Äôll support it.‚Äù",1,1748628275.0,onionheadlines,0,1.0,False

**4th of October 2457, 19:14 UTC**

Zevaryah Abrams jogged the last twenty meters toward the entrance, one hand around the strap of his shoulder bag, the other gripping his ID badge.

The UN-HQ loomed above him, a huge building made out of glass and steel spires. Normally this place was filled with people. Delegates in suits, school groups taking tours, workers talking in their breaks. Today, it was nearly silent.

The front plaza stood abandoned, except for a few security drones idling near the perimeter, some security guards gathered together glued to a screen and a trio of interns outside, still wearing VIP lanyards but staring up at a projection screen floating mid-air above the square. The Pioneer Light, its calculated route showing on the screen, rotating slowly. Zev didnt stop to watch it. He had already memorized the telemetry briefing before sunrise.

The lobby was colder than he remembered.

He stepped through the glass doors, the atmosphere inside strangely sterile. The fountain that usually rippled across the floors center had been powered down. The reception desk was empty. Lights gleamed off polished marble, and every step that Zev made echoed into the silence like a gavel against stone.

Everyone was watching.

He pulled his badge across the scanner. Zevaryah Abrams, Rank 2 ‚Äì Strategic Liaison, UNSA Central.   
The lock clicked open with a sterile beep.

He moved fast, past motionless elevators and long halls filled with translucent glass walls that flickered silently with readouts and mission countdowns. Some still displayed idle personnel status. Others had frozen on images from yesterdays pre-launch.

‚ÄúGood Evening, Director Abrams,‚Äù chirped a soft synthetic voice as he passed a retinal scanner embedded in the wall. Even the AIs tone felt subdued, like it knew better than to interrupt the moment.

The only signs of life were ghostly. Coffee cups left half finished, chairs pushed slightly out from workstations, a jacket draped over a desk, that someone probably forgot. A childs drawing of a stick figure waving next to a silver rocket, likely from one of the scientists kids, floating on a wall display in sleep mode. Three more checkpoints. Two biometric, one physical. Each door opened in sequence, locking behind him with heavy sounding thunks. Security was tighter today than ever. Not because of a threat, but because history didnt allow for mistakes.

Finally, he reached the last gate. A wide, black arch. An armed guard stood waiting.

‚ÄúDirector Abrams,‚Äù the man said, his tone dry but respectful. ‚ÄúRunning a bit behind.‚Äù

Zev smirked. ‚ÄúDidnt want to miss the climax. Just the opening crawl.‚Äù

The guards brow lifted, but he stepped aside after checking Zev and his bag. ‚ÄúEveryone has been inside for the past hour already. Try not to trip on your own clearance.‚Äù

The final door opened.

Warm lighting. Muted conversations. A deep, low hum of the livestream broadcast in the background. The Conference Observation Room.

Inside, it was like walking into the control center of the solar system.

46 people. Each one with weight enough to bend the world.

At the center, seated in a slight arc around the curved main display, were the Presidents of the 5 Colonies and Earths 4 countries, each with their Vice President at their side. Beside them, on a slightly raised seat flanked by the UNSA flag and Earths blue-white insignia, sat Secretary-general Halima Ro.

15 high-ranking Directors and Politicians from the UN, Countries and Colonies sat further back, all Rank 2. In the rear and side seats were the Rank 3s, specialists, donors, and major architects of the mission. That included Jiehong Yao, the trillionaire who bankrolled nearly a fifth of the Pioneer Project. His neural band glowed faint green, he was streaming something live.

Zev spotted his own seat on the far right.

Before he could sit down a voice called out.

‚ÄúNice of you to join us, Abrams,‚Äù said Director Lorne, his direct superior. ‚ÄúWe were worried you were driving to Luna again.‚Äù

A few chuckles scattered through the room.

Zev offered a rueful grin. ‚ÄúMy daughter staged a coup when i tried to leave. I had to promise her that i would bring some chocolate to be allowed to leave.‚Äù

Secretary Ro turned slightly in her seat, smiling without breaking eye contact with the screen. ‚ÄúGlad you made it, Mr. Abrams. But lets not make a habit of historical tardiness.‚Äù

‚ÄúWouldnt dream of it, maam.‚Äù

He put his bag down next to his seat and sat down.

The Lights darkened and a hush settled across the room. The main screen expanded. no longer a simple projection, but a fully immersive 270-degree surround. Everyone turned towards it, as the camera aboard the Pioneer Light streamed live from high earth orbit.

Zev leaned forward slightly in his seat.

The vessel floated above the Earths curve, twin ion booms glinting under the suns rays. Below, the planet sprawled in familiar blue and green serenity. Around the room, even the worlds most powerful people sat motionless.

At the top of the screen was a timer running down. 2:51. The spacecraft is supposed to enter faster than light speed at exactly 19:28:34 UTC.

Inside the cockpit, the three astronauts were calm, professional, every muscle honed by thousands of hours of training.

‚ÄúHumanity, this is Pioneer IV. Coordinates are locked and we will go into FTL in 2 minutes and‚Ä¶ 15 seconds. Destination: Voyager 1. Estimated travel time to the Destination is 16 minutes.‚Äù

There was no cheering yet, just silent reverence. Eyes locked on history.

‚ÄúFinal systems check completed. Mission Control, request permission to engage Alcubierre Drive.‚Äù

A voice replied from offscreen. Calm. Steady. ‚ÄúPioneer Light, Permission granted. Godspeed.‚Äù

Zevs hand tensed against the armrest. The drive had only been tested on drones and automated cargo ships so far. Never with a human aboard. And never so far from home. This is the first trip leaving the solar system.

A gentle hum began, barely audible through the speakers.

The camera outside the ship zoomed out.

A shimmer of impossible color rippled around the Pioneer Light, not blue, not violet, not any shade a human eye could name. Space warped. Stars bent in on themselves. Then, with a soft flash of white at exactly 19:28:34 UTC on the 4th of October 2457, not  single second later, they were gone.

The screen simply showed empty space.

Zev exhaled, not realizing he had been holding his breath.

There was no applause yet.

An overlay displayed the vessels trajectory. Live feed would resume once the ship reentered realspace near the edge of the oort cloud, the current location of the Voyager I.

It had taken that little gold plated machine almost 500 years to get there.

The Pioneer Light would do it in less than 20 minutes.

The room started to chatter. It would take another 15 minutes until the Pioneer Light would reach the Voyager 1, so people walked around and talked for a bit. Zev only drank some water and remained seated.

The main screen flickered.

Signal reacquired.

A short applause emerged, but quickly died down. The big one was being saved for when they returned safely.

‚ÄúWe have visual. Oort Cloud confirmed, and Voyager I is in visual range. Targeting beacon locked. Initiating microdrone release.‚Äù

A small golden glint floated into view: Voyager 1, ancient, pitted, barely functional, but still alive.

The microdrone detached from Pioneer Lights undercarriage and zipped toward the old probe.

It docked. A moment passed. Then another.

‚ÄúMicrodrone has completed attachment. Power transfer beginning. Voyager I is waking up.‚Äù

The Astronauts voice cracked slightly.

The old probes antenna slowly turned. As if it recognized the humans who had come so far.

Around the world and the colonies, people cheered and cried.

But inside the chamber, something changed.

A secondary sensor ping. One of the external cameras shifted.

Something was moving behind them.

‚ÄúCommander,‚Äù said the flight engineers voice, suddenly sharp, ‚Äúwe are detecting a distortion. Local spacetime... its bending again.‚Äù

Zev sat up straighter.

On screen, the stars twisted. And something... emerged.

It didnt flash. It didnt warp in. It simply appeared.

A vessel. Silent. Unmarked. Black and shaped unlike any human craft, no thrusters, no visible cockpit, just a smooth surface.

Zev heard someone whisper, ‚ÄúIs that one of ours?‚Äù

The answer was already obvious.

On screen, the Astronauts voice remained steady.

‚ÄúUnidentified craft has appeared on scope. No IFF beacon. No communication. Maintaining distance. Not hostile, yet.‚Äù

The alien ship did not move closer.

Instead, a beam of soft blue light extended from its hull, connecting, not with the Pioneer Light, but with Voyager I.

A scan?

No.

A message.

Voyager Is dish tilted, just slightly, toward the new ship.

And then.

A new voice came through the speakers.

Not from the Pioneer Light. Not from Earth.

‚ÄúGreetings. Designation: Humanity. You have achieved independent foldlight-travel. By directive of the Galactic Council, your species is hereby recognized as sapient spacefaring civilization. First Contact protocol initiated.‚Äù

The room froze.

No one spoke.

The message continued.

‚ÄúRemain where you are. A liaison vessel will arrive momentarily. Do not attempt evasive action. You are not in danger.‚Äù

1kzb1uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/beatles/comments/1kzb1uc/john_and_cynthia_in_quotes/,John and Cynthia in quotes,"*‚ÄúWe met at art school in Liverpool. I was 18 and he was 17. He‚Äôd just lost his mother. I had a boyfriend when I was 17, he was a lot older than me, about 25. And John went out with a girl called Barbara for a couple of years before he met me. So we‚Äôd both been through the first flush of romance. I was a bit apprehensive of him. I thought he was very funny, but in a rather cruel sort of way. He was fighting the world.‚Äù* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""I met Cynthia at art school. She was a right Hoylake runt. Dead snobby. We used to poke fun at her and mock her, me and Geoff Mohammed. 'Quiet please,‚Äô we‚Äôd shout, 'no dirty jokes, it's Cynthia.‚Äô‚Äù*, John 1968

*""George and Paul both thought it was a great laugh that John was so keen on Cynthia, the lovely girl who used to go to art school with him. Even then, four years before they married, they were crazy over each other. Cyn used to travel thirty miles a night from her home in Hoylake just to sit by the stage of the Casbah, listening to John, playing with us.""*¬†-Ken Brown

*""They were totally opposites but right for each other, and although they came from different backgrounds, they were a perfect match‚Ä¶They loved each other very much. There was no separating them""*¬†- Phyllis McKenzie

*""You know what I have written- carved- on a church in Hamburg? 'John loves Cyn.' That was my first going out with her at that time.""¬†* -John Lennon, interview with Frances Schoenberger |¬†March 1975

*""John and I would go and have a couple of quiet beers, just to sit down and chew the fat. And he'd talk about Cynthia and how much he missed her.""*¬†-Pete Best

*‚ÄúI hate the word, but posh best describes John's first impression of Cynthia. He was clearly attracted to her but hid that behind a regular barrage of bad jokes about her. She was the most important to him for a long time, but John did not want to look weak to his peers, to be soppy over a girl.‚Äù* -Pauline Sutcliffe

*""...I was immediately struck by how different this¬†attractive, well-bred young woman was from all the lowlife scrubbers John had¬†lately been associating with. Cyn proved to be exceptionally polite and almost¬†painfully shy, and I couldn't help but think she was perhaps too fragile a flower¬†to be in John's hands.But if John ever seriously mistreated her, I was never aware of it first-hand, and¬†Cyn's unwavering devotion certainly helped to exorcise some of the pain of Julia's¬†loss.""* -Pete Shotton

*(May 28th, 1971 (Tittenhurst Park, Ascot)*:

INTERVIEWER: Do you think that a new attitude towards  love and relationships ‚Äì would it be fair to say we‚Äôre getting away from  the property concept of relationships? 

JOHN: Of owning the other person? I think ‚Äì yeah, we could be. But uh‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs  all very well intellectually, but when you actually are in love with somebody, you tend to be jealous and want to own them, possess them a hundred per cent. Which I do. 

[...]

JOHN:  But intellectually, before that, I thought ‚Äì right. I mean, owning a  person is rubbish, but. I love Yoko, I want to possess her completely; I  don‚Äôt want to stifle her, you know? [Yoko laughs] And that‚Äôs the  danger, it‚Äôs that you want to possess them to death. But‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a  personal problem of mine. It‚Äôs after the beginning, when it cools down a bit ‚Äì not cools down,  whatever, it st‚Äì uh, whatever the word is, you know ‚Äì that you can allow  each other to breathe. 

YOKO: Yes. When you relax a bit, you know. 

JOHN: But at first you tend to strangle each other, I think.  And because you have so little as a child, I think it is, you ‚Äì when  once you find it, you want to hang onto it, you grab it so much you tend to kill it. 

*""He was full of contradictions and confusion. He wanted proof, daily, that he mattered most to me. He was jealous of my close friendship with Phyl and even of my work, if I chose to spend an evening catching up with it instead of with him. Yet despite John‚Äôs aggression and jealousy I felt protective toward him. To me he was a lost soul and I wanted to give him understanding, acceptance and the security of being loved to ease his pain and bitterness.""* -Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*‚ÄúJohn was very insecure. He was very raw inside and full of pain, emotional pain. I think he really relied on me, and he kept testing me to make sure I was constant and that I wouldn't do anything to hurt or harm him. On one particular occasion, I was dancing with our mutual friend Stuart and he happened to walk in and see it and of course got the wrong idea. The following day, in a blind fury, he just smack me across the face and I hit my head on the pipe that was running down the wall. I walked away. It could have been the end of the relationship if he hadn't phoned me, but he was the one who came back to me. And I just couldn't resist.‚Äù* -
Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*‚ÄúI was hysterical. That was the trouble. I was jealous of anyone she had anything to do with. I demanded absolute trust from her, because I wasn't trustworthy myself. I was neurotic, taking all my frustrations out on her. She did leave me once. That was terrible. I couldn't stand being without her.‚Äù* -John, 1968

*""After three months, he phoned me and asked me to go back to him. It had taken him that long to pluck up the courage. He apologized for hitting me and said it would never happen again. I hesitated for a whole second before I said yes. John was true to his word. He was deeply ashamed of what he had done: I think he had been shocked to discover he had it in him to hit me. So, although he was still verbally cutting and unkind, he was never again physically violent to me. As we grew closer, in the second phase of our romance, even his verbal putdowns and attacks diminished. It was as though the more certain he was that I was there for him and loved him, the easier he found it to remove his protective armor.""* -Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""But there was another element to them. Still insecure, he was always desperate to know that she hadn‚Äôt found another boy while he was away. ‚ÄòI love, love, love you,‚Äô he would write. ‚ÄòPlease wait for me.‚Äô She did. For his part, however, shortly after he arrived in Germany, he was casually unfaithful with a girl who worked in a bar. Did he ever reflect on the hypocrisy in the devotions he regularly posted to Cynthia? Probably. But it was her fidelity to him that was important; not his to her.""* -Ray Connolly, ""Being John Lennon'

*""Frightening and demanding as John could be, he was also romantic, a side of him I saw more often as our relationship deepened. He wrote love poems on scraps of paper and passed them to me at college. For our first Christmas he drew a card with a picture of me in my new shaggy coat, standing opposite him, our heads together, his hand on my arm.""* -Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

(Cynthia discovering she was pregnant) *""Eventually I plucked up all my courage and told him. As the news sank in he went pale and I saw the fear in his eyes. For a couple of minutes we were both silent. I watched him as I waited for a response. Would he walk out on me? Then he spoke: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only one thing for it, Cyn. We‚Äôll have to get married.‚Äù*

*I asked him whether he meant it. I told him he didn‚Äôt have to marry me, that I was prepared to manage on my own, but he was insistent. ""Neither of us planned to have a baby, Cyn, but I love you and I'm not going to leave you now.""* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""When John was at home we enjoyed playing husband and wife. He was loving towards me all through my pregnancy, bringing me flowers or little bits and pieces for our home. Once he came in from a gig and said, ‚ÄòClose your eyes, Mrs Lennon, I‚Äôve got a surprise for you.‚Äô He insisted I feel the gift he‚Äôd brought home before I opened my eyes. It was an ancient coffee-table, but he behaved as though he‚Äôd just got it from Harrods ‚Äì ‚ÄòIsn‚Äôt it fantastic, Cyn? Our first coffee-table. Look, it‚Äôs hand-made, battered copper, only a fiver?‚Äô Despite my misgivings about it, I couldn‚Äôt help but be swept along by his enthusiasm.""* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""John and I were really excited to have our own home. We‚Äôd been married for over sixteen months and hadn‚Äôt yet had a place we felt was ours, away from prying eyes and the demands of the world. It was bliss seeing so much more of him. Of course, he was out a lot of the time, but unless he was away on tour he could come home at night and we were together. For the first time I felt like a married woman.""* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""


*""When Julian had gone to bed and Dot had gone home the house was quiet and we had a chance to unwind and reconnect. We were safe from intruders now, [...] it was wonderful to be close again and to shut out the world. That was when we shared our most affectionate moments. We‚Äôd exchange roses or loving notes and cuddle up together in front of the TV. We called these special John-and-Cyn times, and they were oases of loving peace in the madness of our world. I treasured them.""* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

KANE: So have you been in touch with the people at home?

LENNON: I talk to Cyn almost every night.

KANE: What is she like?

LENNON: Well, she‚Äôs beautiful, you know, and what people don‚Äôt know is how smart she is.¬†No matter what‚Äôs happening, you know, she‚Äôs always there for me.

 - conversation with Larry Kane and John Lennon, 1964)

*""Despite all that was going on around us, and my occasional unease about John and other women, we were a solid unit, happy together and amazed at our good fortune.""* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

[About Cynthia] *""She wasn‚Äôt like my friends, who enjoyed a giggle and some fun: she was rather serious, and often, I thought, behaved more like John‚Äôs mother than his wife.""* - Pattie Boyd, ""Wonderful Tonight: George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Me""

*""John had grown up in the shadow of a domineering woman‚Äîit was what he knew and was most familiar with. While I had offered the devotion and loving acceptance he had needed after his mother‚Äôs death, Yoko offered the security of a mother figure who always knew best. When, in later years, I read comments from Yoko comparing herself to Aunt Mimi I had to smile. She‚Äôd got it dead right.""* -Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""John loved strong women. His mother had been a strong woman, his auntie who brought him up was a strong woman, and bless her, but his first wife wasn‚Äôt. She once said to me, ‚ÄòOh, all I want is sort of a guy who wants his pipe and slippers.‚Äô And I thought, ‚ÄòOooh, that‚Äôs not John.'‚Äù* - Paul McCartney, interview with Howard Stern

*""He did everything he could to persuade me to take LSD again. ‚ÄúCyn, you know how much I love you. I wouldn‚Äôt let anything bad happen to you. We could both benefit from the trip. It would bring us even closer together,‚Äù he begged. ‚ÄúPlease, Cyn, I know if we do it with people we love and trust you‚Äôll be amazed how wonderful it is.‚Äù* -Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""John needed to escape his reality. I understood completely but I couldn't go along with him.""* - Cynthia Lennon regarding John's drug taking.

*""Shortly before we were due to leave for India, John spent the weekend with Derek Taylor, a former journalist who had become the Beatles‚Äô press spokesman and a good friend to us all. He, his wife Joan and their five children lived in a big country house where they seemed incredibly contented. When he came home after that weekend John put his arms around me and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have loads more kids, Cyn, and be really happy.‚Äù* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""There was just one moment of real warmth between us and that was, ironically, when John confessed to me that he had been unfaithful. We were in the kitchen when he said, out of the blue, There have been other women, you know, Cyn.‚Äù*

*""I was taken aback, but touched by his honesty. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I told him.""*

*""He came over to where I was standing beside the sink and put his arms round me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one I‚Äôve ever loved, Cyn,‚Äù he said, and kissed me. ‚ÄúI still love you and I always will.‚Äù* -Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""John and Yoko were sitting on the floor, cross-legged and facing each other, beside a table covered with dirty dishes. They were wearing the terry-cloth robes we kept in the poolhouse, so I imagined they had been for a swim. John was facing me. He looked at me, expressionless, and said, ‚ÄúOh, hi.‚Äù Yoko didn‚Äôt turn around.""*

*""I blurted out the only thing I could think of: ‚ÄúWe were all looking forward to dinner in London after lunch in Rome and breakfast in Greece. Would you like to come?‚Äù*

*As I stood in the doorway, rooted to the spot in shock and pain, John said, indifferently, ‚ÄúNo, thanks.‚Äù
I turned and fled.*

*""I'd never known love like this before, and it hit me so hard that I had to halt my marriage to Cyn. And don't think that it was a reckless decision, but I felt very deeply about it and all the implications that would be involved. My marriage to Cyn was not unhappy. But it was just a normal marital state where nothing happened and which we continued to sustain. You sustain it until you meet somebody who suddenly sets you alight.""* - John Lennon, 1968

I'll be jumping to years later, if you want to read the gritty details of how John and Cynthia's divorce went I suggest reading these:

https://johnandcynthialennon.blogspot.com/2019/01/when-marriage-ends-vol-2.html

(During John's lost weekend)

*""He also did not want to see Cynthia, whom he had not seen in four years. She reminded him of difficult decisions he had made: to leave the Beatles, to divorce her, and to marry Yoko, as well as to abandon his son. After John had made a hard decision, he never wanted to be reminded of that decision or the fact that he had once had a choice.""* - May Pang, ""Loving John""

*""[John's] family dealt with pain by keeping it under wraps. If a subject was difficult, it was not aired. It was an attitude that hurt John, but which he often adopted as an adult. During and after our marriage I discovered that he had an astonishing ability to ignore anything that distressed him.""* - Cynthia, ""John""

*""When the ship docked John was waiting for us on the dock, with May beside him. It was both wonderful and painful to see him again. He was pale and gaunt and clearly nervous. He pecked me on the cheek, then scooped Julian into his arms and hugged him.""* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""He had always hated reminders of painful episodes in his past and I realized, sadly, that that was all I meant to him now. He liked to make a clean break and move on, but because of Julian he couldn‚Äôt do that with me. I could see how hard it must be for him and it wasn‚Äôt easy for me, but I was grateful that he hadn‚Äôt left me alone in New York.""* - Cynthia Lennon, ""John""

*""I think our mutual failure to address or resolve painful issues was a major factor in the eventual breakdown of our marriage. We both had the ability to sit on our feelings, but they inevitably resurfaced as resentment. I have no doubt that it would have made us stronger as a couple if we‚Äôd been able to deal with incidents like this more openly. But at the time I could only take what felt like the best path.""* - Cynthia Lennon, John


*""John was an extraordinary man. Our relationship has shaped much of my life. I have always loved him and never stopped grieving for him.""* - Cynthia Lennon, John

**Opposites Attracted**

Alex Walker loved dogs more than anything. His golden retriever, Max, had been his loyal companion through college, his first real job, and a painful breakup last year. Every Saturday morning, they went to Oakridge Park for Max‚Äôs weekly socialization with the local dog community.

Jordan Chen was a dedicated cat person. Her Bengal cat, Cleo, ruled her apartment with regal authority, and Jordan wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. Each Saturday, Jordan visited her favorite caf√© near Oakridge Park, which had a small garden patio where she could read while Cleo explored her surroundings from the safety of her special cat backpack with a bubble window.

It was a crisp autumn morning when Max, overexcited by a squirrel, broke free from his leash and barreled straight into Jordan‚Äôs table, sending her latte flying and Cleo‚Äôs carrier tumbling.¬†

‚ÄúMax! Get back here!‚Äù Alex shouted, rushing to control his enthusiastic retriever, who was now attempting to befriend a terrified Cleo.

‚ÄúKeep that beast away from my cat!‚Äù Jordan yelled, scooping up Cleo‚Äôs carrier.

Their eyes met over the chaos‚Äîhis apologetic, hers furious.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù Alex said, finally grabbing Max‚Äôs collar. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs friendly, I promise. Just... over-friendly sometimes.‚Äù

Jordan‚Äôs anger softened slightly at his genuine remorse. ‚ÄúWell, your ‚Äòfriendly‚Äô dog just terrorized my cat and ruined my morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me buy you another coffee,‚Äù Alex offered. ‚ÄúAnd maybe some treats for your cat?‚Äù

Despite her better judgment, Jordan agreed. One coffee turned into conversation, which turned into dinner later that week, and before they knew it, they were dating.

**The Pet Problem**

Three months into their relationship, Alex and Jordan faced an inevitable hurdle: moving in together. Both wanted to take this next step, but there was one significant obstacle‚ÄîMax and Cleo despised each other.

‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôre rushing things,‚Äù Jordan suggested after a disastrous attempt at a pet playdate that ended with Cleo on top of a bookshelf and Max whining at the bathroom door where he‚Äôd been sequestered.

‚ÄúNo, we just need a plan,‚Äù Alex insisted. ‚ÄúPeople with cats and dogs live together all the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, but those pets probably don‚Äôt actively plot each other‚Äôs demise,‚Äù Jordan countered, gesturing to Cleo, who was glaring down at Max with unmistakable contempt.

They decided to consult professionals. The veterinarian suggested slow introductions and positive reinforcement. The animal behaviorist recommended creating safe spaces for each pet and respecting their boundaries.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like we‚Äôre diplomats negotiating a peace treaty between two hostile nations,‚Äù Alex joked as they spent an entire Sunday rearranging furniture to create ‚ÄúMax zones‚Äù and ‚ÄúCleo territories‚Äù in Jordan‚Äôs apartment, which was larger than Alex‚Äôs.

**Operation Pet Harmony**

Alex and Jordan devised ‚ÄúOperation Pet Harmony‚Äù‚Äîa systematic plan to make their pets fall in love, or at least tolerate each other.

Step one involved scent swapping. They exchanged pet blankets so Max and Cleo could get used to each other‚Äôs smell. Max seemed indifferent, but Cleo refused to go near anything that smelled like the dog.

Step two was controlled visual contact. They used a baby gate to separate the animals while feeding them treats, creating positive associations. Max would wag his tail excitedly, while Cleo would watch suspiciously from a distance.

Step three entailed supervised interaction. This mostly resulted in Max trying to play and Cleo swatting at his nose before retreating to higher ground.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt working,‚Äù Jordan sighed after two weeks of minimal progress. ‚ÄúMaybe we should just maintain two separate households.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Alex said, noticing something. ‚ÄúLook at them.‚Äù

In the corner of the living room, Max was curled up on his bed, sleeping soundly. And there, at the very edge of the dog bed, was Cleo, cautiously settled with just enough distance to maintain her dignity, but close enough to share Max‚Äôs warmth.

Jordan grabbed her phone and quietly took a picture. ‚ÄúOur first breakthrough!‚Äù

**Unexpected Allies**

Their breakthrough was short-lived. The next day, Cleo and Max were back to their standoff. But Alex had noticed something‚Äîboth pets seemed calmer in the presence of classical music.

‚ÄúWhat if we create more of these peaceful moments?‚Äù he suggested.

They started playing Mozart during feeding time. They discovered both animals enjoyed sunbathing in the patch of light by the bay window. They even found that both Max and Cleo were obsessively interested in a particular squeaky toy shaped like a mouse.

The real turning point came unexpectedly. One night, during a thunderstorm, they found the normally brave Max trembling under the coffee table. Surprisingly, Cleo approached him and curled up nearby, as if providing comfort. By morning, they were sleeping side by side.

‚ÄúThey just needed a common enemy,‚Äù Jordan observed. ‚ÄúThe storm brought them together.‚Äù

Taking a cue from this revelation, Alex and Jordan created more situations where Max and Cleo could ‚Äúteam up‚Äù‚Äîagainst the vacuum cleaner, against the mail carrier who both animals distrusted, against the neighbor‚Äôs annoying parrot.

Slowly but surely, a fragile alliance formed between cat and dog.

**A Blended Family**

Six months later, Jordan and Alex were fully moved in together. While Max and Cleo weren‚Äôt exactly best friends, they had reached an understanding. They shared the apartment with surprising harmony, occasionally even playing a strange game that was half chase, half hide-and-seek.

‚ÄúDo you think they  like each other now?‚Äù Alex asked as they watched Max and Cleo sharing the couch, a respectful few inches between them.

‚ÄúI think they love each other in their way,‚Äù Jordan replied. ‚ÄúKind of like how a dog person and a cat person can love each other despite their differences.‚Äù

That evening, as they all settled in to watch a movie, Cleo surprised everyone by climbing onto Max‚Äôs back and kneading his fur before curling up to sleep. Max simply sighed contentedly, accepting his role as the cat‚Äôs new favorite bed.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Alex whispered, not wanting to disturb the miracle happening on their living room floor, ‚ÄúI guess sometimes love does conquer all.‚Äù

## To the servers

You opted for a job where your income has no protection beyond minimum wage. You *fight for* an industry culture that is subject to manager scheduling & host seating politics as well as your customer feeling sorry for you and subsidizing your income.

In your selfish ""me me me"" take on every aspect of this discussion, you completely neglect how tipping is not just getting more expensive for the same level of service (prices AND percentage on total are going up) but you're *actively* contributing to its spread to everything from booking websites to self pump gas stations.

We are trying to fix this with legislation - servers are the most vocal proponents of maintaining the status quo. You could have worked collectively to raise not only your own standard of living but those of employees everywhere, but instead you chose infighting and perpetuating the cycle of exploitation. Your employer exploits you, and you exploit the customer by adding heaps of shame and guilt to every transaction.

So, you leave us with the one option that was there all along - *don't tip!*

### What we want (for the staff)
* Fair and stable pay across BOH & FOH and better (fair!) comparisons across other professions
* Workers rights
* Unionization

### What we want (for the customer)
* Transparent pricing
* Same income taxation as everyone else
* Removing the anxiety of knowing what is an appropriate tip
* Not worrying about whether our random act of kindness is the difference in you making your rent
* Stopping the rampant expectation of tips at all businesses in lieu of employers actually paying their employees
* To simply enjoy a coffee or meal without an extra large side of guilt and worry 

### What we already know (so stop pointing it out):

Prices will likely be the same or higher. Yes, that is understood. This is completely missing the point.

### How we'd like to get there

Ideally, we get there via legislation that establishes worker protections like guaranteed, steady pay.

Why is this good?
* It will level the playing field among all positions (FOH & BOH)
* It will increase transparency and provide steady income across seasonal businesses
* It will encourage workers to act collectively instead of infighting on how to further divide up those poorly understood tips (directing their energy and ire at owners and managers rather than at each other)

Unfortunately, *every time* a bill comes up in any given state trying to move away from tips servers climb over each other to be the most vocal opponents alongside the owners.

Why is that? Well they *say* a bunch of things, but in reality:
* They have to actually report cash tips and pay income tax like everyone else
* It will likely initially lower (some people's) income while:
	* The system adapts to global conventions across most businesses (short term pain, long term gain)
	* People no long over estimate how much is considered a good tip to avoid being socially punished: ""better leave 25% just to be safe""
* They're selfish. Minimum wage *is* too low. For *many* jobs. But all we hear is ""me"", ""I"" in everyone's comments. This only changes through collective action.

## How we're going to have to get there

For as long as servers and owners are content to [publicly](https://www.cantonrep.com/story/lifestyle/food/2025/05/22/american-tipping-culture-tips-restaurants/83471540007/) perpetuate the exploitation cycle, legislation isn't going to happen.

> ‚ÄúI expect a tip,"" she said. ""Why shouldn‚Äôt I be tipped for doing my job?‚Äù

As customers, we have 3 options:
1. Don't go to tipped business: While reasonable, this is an ineffective form of activism. We also don't know if many businesses are tipped until we get there - everyone is asking for tips now.
2. Go and tip: Business as usual. Tipping continues spreading like wildfire, further degrading employees' position
3. Go and don't tip: This is the one choice which has a chance of effecting change

If #3 weren't an option, your location would have an auto-gratuity. Clearly the business owner accepts that people may not tip. Relying on social pressure to pay for a roof over your head is *exactly* the precarious position you need to escape.

### My responses to the short-term drive-by comments on every post here

Some of these are a little repetitive because, well, the same arguments are repeated in a single comment chain as if they are some clever irrefutable gotcha. It's almost like they don't actually have a good argument and so are just deploying shame and guilt since that usually works for them.

**The price would be the same if we paid them a salary**: You may be correct! We know this. Congratulations for figuring this out.

**You don‚Äôt actually care about the worker, you‚Äôre not tipping because you're cheap/want to save money**: Covered above - we expect prices to be the same or higher (but now transparent!). And why do you make such a big deal about tipping out then?

Also - how is that relevant? I'm sure there are customers who don't tip because they want to save money. Why are you mad that them? Your employer explicitly allows this. Why is that? Have you brought it up to them? This behavior is inevitable when the only employment protection afforded you is guilt and shame.

**You‚Äôre broke**: Immediately know you're talking to a server as this is their flagship go to statement. What does this even mean? And what does it mean coming from someone holding out their hand the entire time we are with you? This is an extremely low EQ insult that I cannot wrap my head around. Why is being broke a reason to attack someone - shouldn't we have empathy for those people? Aren't you arguing that we should pay tips because otherwise you'll be broke?

**I/‚Äúthey‚Äù make $2/hr!**: We all know that isn't true. And it if it were, it wouldn't be the customer's fault.

**But the minimum wage isn't livable!**: I agree, and telling people to become servers to escape this is a pretty broken system! Collective action and united workforce are the answer here, not begging. We welcome servers to join the fight to raise the minimum wage!

Also, there must be some servers actually making this minimum wage. Is that ok? I guess so since they're not *good* servers, right? Is it also ok for all the non-servers making minimum wage?

**You‚Äôre only hurting the worker**:  The employer harms the worker by not paying them. The employer harms the worker by telling them to expect tips but then not guaranteeing that they are given. The server then harms the customer by guilting them in what should be a simple transaction. The server is complicit in the exploitation cycle.

This is a bad faith argument. In the short term, it will likely hurt the worker, but they are not innocent. The fault here lies with the worker fighting alongside their employer for this cycle to continue. *But what happens in the long-term if everyone stops tipping?*

**Write your senator**: We aren't the ones engaging in anti-consumer, unfair practices. Write *your* senator about your living wage issues. You're *enabling* poor worker treatment everywhere.

**Why don‚Äôt you go after \<billionaire name\>**: Just because something else is bad doesn't mean you ignore the bad you're in direct contact with. Unfair labor practices are everywhere. There isn't some ownership asset threshold where it's ok.

**Name calling (cringe, toxic, mentally ill) ad hominems**: Playing directly into the intra-class warfare. You're either a bad faith actor or so wound up in Stockholm Syndrome that you have failed to take a hard look at your unfair circumstances. Would you say this to your employer who is stiffing you every day? These are all largely projection in my experience.

**Fair wages will never happen**: True if we blindly continue tipping and subsidizing your owner's business. But what happens if everyone stops? It'll certainly be painful but it's been a long time coming.

**My restaurant wouldn't survive without tips**: Ok? So tips are keeping a dead business afloat. Earlier you said we are hurting the worker by not tipping but now it sounds like it is the business owner who is affected? Interesting. 

**You think you‚Äôre better/they are beneath you**: The lowest form of gotcha they love to employ as though it invalidates the action. By being complicit in tipping, behavior where you sing and dance for customers irrespective of their treatment of you in the hopes for a handout, *you* are putting *yourself* beneath us and *you are fighting to stay there*!

**They work hard**: Then why do you accept your employer's sub-minimum wage pay? Have you worked in any other setting? Because most people are not just hanging out all day. If it is so hard, why not get a different job?

**Other industries have similar payment structures**: This one is actually pretty hilarious because people always bring up buying a car as if that's a pleasant experience full of ""great service"" stories. It's the perfect example of how I don't want to enjoy sitting down for a relaxing meal out or quickly grabbing a coffee.

**They provide great service!**: Does great service include me having to calculate how much your time and effort is worth and potentially getting accosted on the way out or down the street? Worrying about whether you can pay rent? Worrying if you've had a slow night? How does that make any sense?

No, seriously, how can you claim a great sit down service while simultaneously making the customer have to consciously consider:
* Is this service bad, good or great?
* What even is the appropriate tip amount for that level of service?
* What amount do I get shamed at?
* If they aren't paying taxes on tips now, is a lower tip accounting for that acceptable?
* Wow look at this poor hard worker, I'd better reach into my pocket to reward him
* Does the server actually recommend a dish they thought was good or was it just because it was the second most expensive item on the menu?

There is no such thing as great service where I am *forced* to consider those things.

**Customers are rude**: Again, have you worked elsewhere? Humans are rude. We in other professions aren't constantly surrounded by nice people either. If it is really that bad your employer should be compensating you, adding additional staff or not allowing those people to stay.

**If you don't tip, stay at home**: I doubt your employer agrees with that at all. If they did, there wouldn't be an *optional* request after the transaction is complete. 

Also, no.

And before you respond, remember that *no* is a complete sentence.",9,1748628167.0,EndTipping,1,1.0,False

The first day I thought was gonna be a piece of cake, I went to the first and second class and immediately saw my needs deplete rapidly. During the rest period between the second and third class, I decided to get some coffee from a coffee shop to raise my energy and hunger. As my sim had just entered the coffee shop, the interaction was cancelled and a new task popped up telling her to go to the next class. I was like ""What?!?! ALREADY?!?!"". 

I tried to buy the coffee and drink it quickly before I completely missed the class. I bought the coffee and my sim grabbed it and guess what? THE COFFEE STRAIGHT-UP DISAPPEARED FROM HER HANDS!!! I searched everywhere in my inventory and it wasn't there. FOR GOD'S SAKE I EVEN SEARCHED THE FAMILY INVENTORY. It took me awhile to accept the fact that the coffee had vanished into oblivion so I was forced to go to class and hope for the best.

I started getting the gist of things from day two up until the day of the finals. I managed to balance the needs and the study time, attend all the classes, practice some skills etc. I totally had this in the bag... or at least I thought. The day just before the finals I looked at my school progress and it had barely even made a dent. After all I had done my progress was still very lowww!!!! I started panicking and began forcing her to study harder. The progress rose for a bit but the damage was already done.

  
The day of the finals arrived and my needs were COMPLETELY FUCKED!!!! It's like my sim just gave up and decided to accept her brutal fate. I still tried to replenish the needs but every need I took care of 2 hours passed in game. To add salt to injury, I couldn't even eat at the dorm which I was staying at because I had the Shop for Groceries mod which basically removes the ability to cook any dish which your sim lacks ingredients for. I pretty much couldn't cook any food so my sim had to depend on fast food, or hope that a roommate serves food which she can go and eat before it gets spoiled and trust me. A LOT OF THE FOOD WAS GETTING SPOILED.    Anyways, it was time for finals. My sim took the first exam, passed. She took the second exam, failed. She took the third exam, FAILED. She was so stressed and fed up ( the image as proof). The report card came in, she got a C and I spent like 1 day(in game lol) watching the other sims fight each other, arrange protests, piss themselves, passing out from their tight schedule, getting angry from all the stress etc.. while I wondered how EA managed to make the most accurate simulation of University life.",14,1748628026.0,Sims3,3,1.0,False

So, if you want to leave some of the creative emoticons or flowery text that many users do, I've put together information about what character sets you can use, as well as a (large) list of various text art and emojis/emoticons you can use in Harvest Town. 

There's a website you can use to create ""cool"" text. I'll add a link in a comment. It also provides a fast way to use multiple alphabets, such as Thai, Greek, Latin, and Georgian. Georgian in particular seems popular to create ASCII art and emoticons.

Technically Harvest Town doesn't allow emojis, as far as I can tell. But you can definitely draw emoticons using the language character sets that it *does* allow.

I'm an Engineering student at the University of Manitoba. 

I'm currently working on a class project related to recycling in Winnipeg and my team has chosen to focus on Styrofoam (EPS) products 

My task is to gather some general data and more specifically volume data from Winnipeg to be able to produce economic options for a future styrofoam recycling program. 

If you have a quick moment there is a 6 question survey I created below  üëá 

https://s.surveyplanet.com/h1cjbfqe

The survey is and should be anonymous, no sign in or email. It might ask for a name but you can just put John Doe or whatever.

If you don't want to take the survey you can also just comment here with the number of times you think you use Styrofoam products per month? And if you would be willing to drop off of products at local retailers?

Products can include but are not limited to 
(Packing insulation/protection, food container, craft uses, packaging peanuts, coffee cups(those little white ones not typically Tim's or Starbucks etc), and some types of construction insulation). We are specifically focusing on EPS(expanded)type styrofoam NOT XPS(extruded)type.

Additionaly if anyone has good resources or information to share about the subject from their own experience I'd appreciate any comments

1kzauzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsefulThingsOnly/comments/1kzauzt/how_to_organize_a_small_space/,How to Organize a Small Space,"Living in a small space whether it‚Äôs a studio, a tiny apartment, or a shared home can get overwhelming fast. But with some strategy and a bit of ruthless decision-making, you can make even the tiniest space feel functional, tidy, and comfortable. I‚Äôve lived in cramped spaces for years, and these are the most effective tips I‚Äôve picked up (and what I typically recommend to others).

# 1. Declutter Like You Mean It

In small spaces, clutter is your worst enemy. Every single item takes up precious real estate.

**What works:**  
Go through your stuff and ditch anything you don‚Äôt use regularly. If you haven‚Äôt touched it in 6 months, it‚Äôs probably safe to donate, sell, or toss. I usually start with one drawer or one shelf so it doesn‚Äôt feel overwhelming.

**Tip:** Sentimental items? Store them in small bins under the bed or high up in the closet, don‚Äôt let them take over your prime space.

# 2. Max Out Your Vertical Space

If you can‚Äôt build out, build up.

**What works:**  
Wall-mounted shelves, tall bookcases, or cube storage like IKEA Kallax. Add fabric bins (like Drona) to hide visual clutter. One wall of shelves can hold a ton without making the room feel chaotic.

*Tall, narrow furniture beats wide, bulky pieces every time in small rooms. And make sure everything‚Äôs anchored properly, especially if you have kids.*

# 3. Use Furniture That Earns Its Keep

In small spaces, everything should do double duty.

**What works:**  
A bed with drawers, a folding desk, or a storage ottoman can seriously cut down the number of things you need. I‚Äôve even replaced coffee tables with end tables to save space.

**I typically recommend:** Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist for scoring multi-purpose furniture cheap. You‚Äôd be surprised what you can find for under $25.

# 4. Hide Storage in Plain Sight

Keeping things out of sight is a game-changer for mental clarity.

**What works:**  
Under-bed bins, over-the-door racks, and baskets inside cabinets can help organize without turning your room into a storage unit. Label everything, especially if you share the space with family or roommates.

**Tip:** Check unused areas like the back of closets, the side of the fridge, or even behind your sofa. There‚Äôs often room hiding in plain sight.

# 5. Keep It Minimal and Intentional

Less stuff = less stress.

**What works:**  
Stick to essentials and things you genuinely love. I follow a ‚Äúone in, one out‚Äù rule, if I buy something new, I get rid of something else.

**In my experience:** Minimalism isn‚Äôt about having nothing... it‚Äôs about choosing *what‚Äôs worth keeping*. Start small and be honest with yourself.

# 6. Create Clear Zones

Tiny homes still need structure.

**What works:**  
Even in one room, you can create ‚Äúzones‚Äù for different activities‚Äîwork, play, sleep. Use rugs, curtains, or furniture placement to separate them visually.

*Rolling carts or portable storage that you can move around depending on your needs. Super helpful for multi-purpose rooms.*

# 7. Don‚Äôt Overspend. Get Creative

Organizing doesn‚Äôt have to break the bank.

**What works:**  
Second-hand furniture, thrift store finds, and even DIY hacks. For example, cereal boxes cut into drawer dividers or hanging rods for cleaning supplies under the sink.

**Tip:** Check YouTube channels like *Dear Modern* for great, budget-friendly organizing ideas, especially if you‚Äôve got kids.

# 8. Build Good Habits

Systems only work if you maintain them.

**What works:**  
The ‚Äúdon‚Äôt put it down, put it away‚Äù rule is gold. Also, assigning small tasks to specific days (like laundry on Mondays) makes the chaos manageable.

**In my experience:** A small notebook or whiteboard to track chores can really help. Even five-minute cleanups make a difference in tight spaces.

# 9. Use Visual Tricks

A well-designed small space feels bigger.

**What works:**  
Stick with light-colored walls and furniture. Add mirrors to reflect light. And choose just a few personal touches like a plant or artwork... so it feels cozy, not cluttered.

**I typically recommend:** Painting shelves or walls white or pale blue. It makes a surprising difference in how open your space feels.

# 10. Keep Learning and Tweaking

Every small space is different, so treat it like a fun puzzle.

**What works:**  
Watch small apartment tours, check out blogs, and experiment with your layout. Even floor plan apps or games like Minecraft can help you plan.

*Take photos of your space. You‚Äôll see things you miss day-to-day and it helps when asking for feedback in online communities.*",1,1748627782.0,UsefulThingsOnly,0,1.0,False

I added him on Facebook, he reached me out and told me to add him on instagram then tried to call I ignored him then texted me via WhatsApp and said he has feelings, and quickly asked to meet. On social media He seemed confident and open, but I'm reserved and cautious.

During the date:
He showed up in traditional clothes, His body language was reserved and intense, He didn‚Äôt flirt overtly or joke excessively. Instead, he observed, asked deep questions, and was visibly nervous ‚Äî
He asked me to remove his necklace from his hand (weird test?), then gave a light high five.
He opened up fast‚Äîtalked about his ex-fianc√©e, culture, marriage, to much questions about my family, etc.
I stayed calm, didn‚Äôt overshare, and joked lightly but kept distance. 

At the end, he opend the car door silently didn‚Äôt make a flirty or casual goodbye, and reacted with internal conflict when i said ‚ÄúHave fun‚Äù ‚Äî no smooth line or exit joke. Just silence and tension. I said ‚ÄúHave fun,‚Äù and he just nodded quietly.

After the date:
I messaged him politely next day"" hi it was nice to meet you, thanks for the coffee!""‚Äîhe replied a day later with ""hi my pleasure.. see you again soon:)""
. Then he got quiet. I removed him from Instagram. He reacted on Facebook with symbolic stories and started posting old family pics + his pics with kids.
He never reached out again. But he still watches from afar‚Äîno messages.

1kzam11,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1kzam11/immersion_vs_percolation_in_hybrid_brewers/,Immersion vs percolation in hybrid brewers,"Hello, 

I have a dilemma about percolation and immersion in hybrid brewers - ones that allow you to control the flow of the water. Are there any rules or guidelines that might be applicable to using immersion and for how long in hybrids? 

As an example I can use [Wilder Lazo ""washed"" Sidra](https://www.thecoffeeobsessive.com/product/module-m3/887), that has a very interesting flavor profile, which can be described as floral spices and it was very apparent when cupping the coffee for the first time. However having tried to brew the coffee through standard flat bottom (e.g. April) the interesting spice part was almost missing and pushed further back. So I went to hybrid brewer, did percolation first, quick 1 min immersion second and got the clarity and flavor profile I was looking for back. It was so good that I did not experiment further.

It got me thinking that I am not exactly sure how the taste profile would be affected if I switched the immersion and percolation phases. Brewing more and more coffees with hybrid approaches I am able to fine tune very specific taste profile, which is amazing, but I cannot wrap my head around the logic and stark differences that even the length of immersion phases can have. 

Yes in general seeking clarity and acidity is mostly done through percolation and immersion gives you somewhat of a balance and complexity. But at this point getting a new coffee my approach is cupping -> standard percolation and then finetuning with hybrids. However I'd like to be able to tell how the coffee is going to react to aforementioned parameters.

Have you found by either experimenting or chemistry of compounds in the beans some guidelines for which coffees benefit from extended immersion, or just pure percolation?

*****

&nbsp;

The corridor outside Grace Murdock‚Äôs hospital room was too clean, too quiet, and smelled faintly of antiseptic and over-boiled coffee. Jack sat low in one of the plastic waiting chairs, their hoodie bunched up behind their neck, chewing the inside of their cheek so hard they‚Äôd tasted blood twice already. Matt stood nearby, arms folded, the cane pressed flat across his chest like a crucifix.

The door opened with a hush of air and a soft click.

‚ÄúMr Murdock?‚Äù The doctor stepped out, middle-aged, in cool-toned scrubs, hair tied back into a ponytail. She had that tired, clinical kindness that could be switched on whenever needed. Her eyes, though, locked onto Jack like she‚Äôd known them in a past life.

Matt turned first. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs us.‚Äù

She nodded and stepped fully into the corridor. ‚ÄúYour wife‚Äôs stable. We ran a full scan as standard procedure after she lost consciousness. It‚Äôs a good thing you brought her in when you did.‚Äù

Jack straightened. ‚ÄúWhy? What did you find?‚Äù

The doctor glanced at her tablet, but the weight of her stare never really left Jack. ‚ÄúWe caught the early formation of a cerebral aneurysm. It hadn‚Äôt ruptured yet, but it would have. Maybe not today, maybe not this year, but it was there, coiled like a fuse.‚Äù

Jack blinked. Their chest tightened as if a hand had just reached inside and gripped their lungs.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what now?‚Äù Matt asked. His voice was level.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in recovery. We clipped it, minimal invasion. She‚Äôll need rest. She‚Äôll be okay.‚Äù Then she paused. ‚ÄúShe got off easy.‚Äù

She said it like a diagnosis. Her gaze sharpened as she looked at Jack - too knowing, too specific.

Like she wasn‚Äôt really there.

Like something was puppeteering her from behind her own eyes.

Jack‚Äôs breath caught in their throat. ‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù they asked.

The doctor blinked. Her expression softened. ‚ÄúOh, just that you were lucky.‚Äù She looked back to her tablet, like she‚Äôd forgotten the last few seconds. ‚ÄúShe's ready to go home later today, we don't need to do any further tests. One of you can see her now, if you‚Äôd like.‚Äù

Jack couldn‚Äôt speak. Could barely move. The muscles in their legs had gone liquid.

Matt gave a grateful nod and stepped past them, the door closing behind him with a whisper.

Jack sat still. Heart pounding. Skin prickling with heat. They didn‚Äôt need an angel on their shoulder to spell it out.

*You got off easy.*

That wasn‚Äôt the doctor. That was him. Lucifer.

Sending a message, the same way a kid at school might scrawl a threat in red pen across someone‚Äôs locker.

Grace had asked too many questions. And next time, it wouldn‚Äôt be a warning.

Jack swallowed hard, feeling the bile rise anyway. The fluorescent lights above flickered once, barely. But Jack felt it like thunder.

The devil had spoken.


&nbsp;

 üî∫ üîª üî∫

&nbsp;


Jack hadn‚Äôt changed out of their school clothes. Their bag lay untouched by the door. They sat cross-legged on the bed, hoodie still zipped up to the neck, fingers nervously brushing the edge of their desk drawer. It caught on the frame as Jack opened it. Inside, between sheets of loose leaf and dead pens, was the diary. Unmarked on the cover. Barely opened outside of one purpose.

They flicked to the middle. A page of tally marks met them, four vertical, one diagonal. Four comets. Four possessions. Each marked with time, date, weather conditions, moon phase. Trying to find a rhythm to the madness. Something to warn them next time.

Another might be coming soon. That much was obvious. They‚Äôd thought it was random, but they couldn‚Äôt rely on that much being true.

Jack stared at the page until the marks blurred. Every fibre of them wanted to stay in this room. Lock the door. Chain it, even though it only locked from the inside. Bury the diary under the mattress and pray the sky stayed clear.

But they couldn't risk it. The last place they would want to turn was at home. Not again.

The knock came just as they were about to shut the drawer.

‚ÄúJack?‚Äù Matt‚Äôs voice was soft, but didn‚Äôt ask. Just entered. He always did.

Jack didn‚Äôt turn around. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù

Matt stepped into the room, pausing just inside the door. His presence filled the space like it always did. Still in his coat from the hospital, he smelled like disinfectant. ‚ÄúI thought you might want to talk.‚Äù

Jack said nothing.

Matt stepped closer, finding the desk chair and turning it around to sit. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to be fine. That‚Äôs what the doctors said.‚Äù

Jack nodded, swallowing back something sharp in their throat. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre scared,‚Äù Matt said.

Jack didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame you. This has been a lot. For her. For you.‚Äù Matt hesitated. ‚ÄúBut I think it‚Äôs been building for a while, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs heart sank. Their eyes met his glasses for a split second before looking away.

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôve been gone. And that I missed... a lot. You were already changing by the time I got back. More than just growing up.‚Äù

Jack nodded once. More truth than Matt realised.

Matt‚Äôs voice stayed even, but softer now. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs things I can‚Äôt fix. But I want to be here now. And nothing matters more to me than your safety. Your happiness. You don‚Äôt have to carry everything alone. Not anymore.‚Äù

Jack finally looked at him. ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù they said quietly.

There was a silence. Comfortable, then tense.

Matt leaned forward, elbows on knees. ‚ÄúSo talk to me. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

Jack froze. Their hands tensed in their lap. The diary stayed in the drawer, silent. They couldn‚Äôt tell him. Not about Lucifer. Not about Darkdevil. And definitely not about what happened to Grace. If Matt tried to dig up the past...

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù Jack whispered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know where I‚Äôd start.‚Äù

Matt let it go. ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù

Jack shifted, then asked, ‚ÄúWhat do you do when you‚Äôve done something wrong? Something... bad. And it‚Äôs eating you alive. You wish you could forget, but you can‚Äôt.‚Äù

Matt was quiet for a long time.

Jack‚Äôs breath caught. They hadn‚Äôt meant to say it. Not like that. Their mouth moved before their mind could stop it. They braced themselves for a question. For him to press.

But he didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúTo be ignorant of your own wrongdoings,‚Äù Matt said finally, ‚Äúis the worst kind of blindness. Being able to recognise the harm you‚Äôve done? That‚Äôs a gift. Most people go their whole lives without it.‚Äù

Jack looked away. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt feel like a gift.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Matt agreed. ‚ÄúBut recognising it doesn‚Äôt mean you have to shoulder it alone.‚Äù

He stood, shrugged his coat straighter, and turned toward the door.

‚ÄúCome on. Get your shoes.‚Äù

Jack blinked. ‚ÄúWhere are we going?‚Äù

Matt didn‚Äôt answer.

He just said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù

The church loomed like a memory Jack didn‚Äôt want. Clinton Church was tucked off a quieter street, the sort of holy place that tried to soften the edges of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen with incense and quiet. It failed. The building looked too clean for the neighbourhood, the stone face scrubbed too often, the stained-glass windows too intact. It stuck out like a guilty conscience.

Jack followed Matt up the steps, each footfall an echo. Guilt tightened like a wire in their chest. They didn‚Äôt remember killing Father Lantom, but he was dead all the same.

Matt was speaking softly, as if not to break something. ‚ÄúI know they teach some of this in school, but confession‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not really about rules. Not for me, anyway.‚Äù

The doors opened with a creak, the inside cool and hushed. Stained glass stretched across the high walls, casting shards of red and blue and gold light across the pews. The air smelled of old wood and fresh incense, spiced and heavy. Shadows bled between the columns, curling in the edges of Jack‚Äôs vision. This place should have felt like a safe space. Instead, it itched for reasons Jack wouldn‚Äôt finger.

‚ÄúThere he is,‚Äù came a warm voice.

A man emerged from a side corridor. Older, but not fragile‚Äîtall, with a worn face and a full head of grey hair combed neatly back. His cassock swayed as he moved. He smiled like someone who knew grief but still had use for joy.

‚ÄúFather Neal, is it?‚Äù Matt greeted him. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to finally meet you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always welcome here, Matthew.‚Äù He turned his eyes to Jack. ‚ÄúAnd you must be Jack. I‚Äôve heard a lot about you.‚Äù

Jack managed a polite nod. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd known Father Lantom better,‚Äù Neal continued. ‚ÄúWe only spoke once or twice before‚Ä¶ well, before I came here.‚Äù

Matt gave a noncommittal smile. ‚ÄúHe was a good man.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you here for confession?‚Äù

Jack hesitated.

‚ÄúThey are,‚Äù Matt answered for them. ‚ÄúI figured it might help.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs mouth felt dry. ‚ÄúYeah. I guess.‚Äù

Matt turned to them, lowered his voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go get something for us to eat from around the block. Take your time.‚Äù

Jack watched him leave, the door closing behind him with a soft thunk. The silence after was too much.

‚ÄúCome,‚Äù Father Neal said kindly, gesturing toward the box..

The confessional smelled like lemon polish and old books. The cushion beneath Jack squeaked when they sat. A faint breath of incense lingered in the woodgrain, as if the whole box had been soaked in years of whispered guilt. The lattice separating them was old, painted white and cracked in places. Neal‚Äôs silhouette blurred behind it.

‚ÄúWhat you say here is between you, me, and God,‚Äù Father Neal said. ‚ÄúYou could threaten to burn this whole church down, with everyone inside, and I couldn‚Äôt break the seal.‚Äù

Jack didn‚Äôt speak for a moment. That was a strange example, but it demonstrated the point. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure where to start.‚Äù

‚ÄúStart where it hurts.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ not always in control,‚Äù Jack said. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm not even there. But I wake up, and people are hurt. Sometimes worse.‚Äù

‚ÄúTemptation takes many forms,‚Äù Neal answered. ‚ÄúThe devil prowls in different skins. But we are called to resist. That‚Äôs where faith begins.‚Äù

Jack stared at the slats of the lattice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not tempted. It‚Äôs not like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you feel forced?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYet you‚Äôre here. That means you know it‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù

Jack swallowed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been trying to do better. I‚Äôve been helping people. It doesn‚Äôt change the past, I know, but‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not how it works,‚Äù Father Neal said, tone firm but not cruel. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt balance the scales. You confess. You ask forgiveness.‚Äù

Jack stared down at their hands. ‚ÄúAnd if I‚Äôm not worried about Heaven?‚Äù

There was a long pause.

‚ÄúYou should be.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs brow furrowed. ‚ÄúWhat if I just‚Ä¶ need saving here?‚Äù

The air changed.

‚ÄúSin infects the world,‚Äù Neal said, voice heavier. ‚ÄúWe live among it. Wallow in it. But some of us‚Ä¶ some of us are chosen. Touched. Gifted with the strength to do what others can‚Äôt. God doesn‚Äôt give that power to everyone. But when He does, we are called to do what we can to purge the wicked.‚Äù

Jack‚Äôs stomach turned. The air around them felt oily now. There was a pressure, like a second heartbeat under the floorboards. They felt the warbled veracity of it - not in the words, but in the way the space warped around the priest. Something foul. Something not quite right.

‚ÄúIt sounds like you have a duty,‚Äù Neal continued, almost tenderly. ‚ÄúTo root out sin. To burn it from this world.‚Äù

Jack stood abruptly.

‚ÄúI need to go,‚Äù they muttered.

‚ÄúChild, wait‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, Father.‚Äù Jack didn‚Äôt look back.

They were out the door before they realised they were running. They didn‚Äôt stop until they‚Äôd ducked into a narrow alley two streets over. Their stomach clenched. They doubled over and vomited behind a dumpster, bile hot in their throat.

They wiped their mouth, hands shaking. Their eyes stung, but no tears came. They were too used up.

Father Lantom. A good man. A gentle man. And Lucifer had killed him through Jack‚Äôs hands. And now there was Neal - Father Neal, whose words offered a colourfully different interpretation of scripture. Jack didn‚Äôt know what he was, but they knew what he wasn‚Äôt.

He wasn‚Äôt here to save anybody.

What if Lantom hadn‚Äôt just been in the way?

What if Neal was always the plan?

The light clicked off with a soft snap. Darkness fell over the bedroom, not that Matt needed the light. The warmth of Grace's shoulder lingered against his own beneath the covers, her hair brushing his cheek as she shifted beside him.

‚ÄúYou're sure you're okay?‚Äù he asked, his voice low.

‚ÄúStop fussing,‚Äù she murmured, nudging him gently. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt die, Matty. I just fainted.‚Äù

He let out a breath that was part chuckle, part something heavier. ‚ÄúYou make it sound like fainting‚Äôs not a big deal when it lands you in the ICU.‚Äù

Grace turned onto her side, facing him, the blankets shifting. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be dramatic. I‚Äôm fine. You worry too much.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt worry enough,‚Äù Matt said, quieter now.

A beat passed. Then Grace said, ‚ÄúSo how‚Äôd it go today? With Jack.‚Äù

Matt rested his head back against the pillow. ‚ÄúGood. I think. Took them to the church.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Grace smiled. ‚ÄúLantom‚Äôs old place.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. Then, ‚ÄúJack gave confession.‚Äù

Grace‚Äôs eyebrows lifted in surprise. ‚ÄúWow. That‚Äôs... huge. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre spending time together, Matt. That means a lot. Especially now.‚Äù

Matt hesitated. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs eating them up. I can feel it. It‚Äôs more than teenage angst, more than school or... me coming back, or losing Father Lantom.‚Äù

Grace waited. Matt chewed his lip.

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt shake this feeling that I failed the kid,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúEverything they‚Äôve been through. I wasn‚Äôt there when it mattered. I don‚Äôt even know who they were becoming during those years. Hell, I barely know who I was.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù Grace said, squeezing his hand. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre here now. That‚Äôs what counts.‚Äù

‚ÄúI took them to confession,‚Äù Matt said. ‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt even done it myself.‚Äù

Grace blinked. ‚ÄúYou could. You should. Maybe Father Neal‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried,‚Äù Matt said. His hand went to his temple. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt. Not just because I don‚Äôt want to - because I literally don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd say. I left. I disappeared for years. And when I try to remember why, all I get is‚Ä¶ static. Scraps. A face here. A scream. The stink of blood. And nothing else.‚Äù

Grace was silent. Then she winced.

Matt turned, alarmed. ‚ÄúHey. You okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù Grace said, breathing through her nose, pressing her fingers to her forehead. ‚ÄúHeadache. It‚Äôs passing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Don‚Äôt make that face, I can feel it in the dark.‚Äù

Matt gave a soft, sheepish laugh. Then, more seriously, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna get some air.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be long.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.‚Äù

Matt reached over for his cane, found the curve of the handle, and rose from bed. His footfalls were soft on the hallway floor. Grace nestled back into the pillow, the room bathed in silence once more, save for the echo of a headache she couldn‚Äôt quite explain.

Late that night, Darkdevil crouched on a ledge rising high above the Clinton Church from across the street. The skyline glared with sodium-orange haze. Beneath them, the church and its adjoining rectory squatted in silence, its stained-glass windows dimmed in the moonlight.

Jack narrowed their eyes. A faint throb hummed through their temples as they focused, tuning out the hum of neon, the clatter of distant taxis, and the static murmur of Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. Their hearing stretched and tunneled, honing in on one voice in one building, the breath and heartbeat of one man. Father Neal.

Jack‚Äôs jaw tightened. They didn‚Äôt even want to be near this place, but something in them - a gnawing need for absolution, or maybe justice - wouldn‚Äôt let it go. Father Lantom was dead, and it had been their hands. Jack didn‚Äôt know why, only that it was Lucifer‚Äôs will. They needed to know that Father Neal wasn‚Äôt part of this, and that hopefully they were just being paranoid.

But while Jack listened with supernatural precision to the soft cadence of Father Neal reading quietly to himself, they failed to notice the shadow that lurked behind them.

A shape cut through the darkness - black on black, a blur of movement - and Jack only caught the glint of steel as the sword sliced clean across their ribs.

Pain didn‚Äôt register. Not in Devilmode. But the impact did. Jack stumbled back, their conjured tunic already scorched open where the blade had split it, ichor and sparks hissing from the wound like steam off a brand.

Jack snapped their quarterstaff into existence, fire crackling around their fingers. They blocked the next slash with a clang that rang like a bell. The attacker - whoever he was - moved with frightening precision. His armour was light, black-and-gold, designed for speed, and his face was concealed behind a ninja‚Äôs hood and mask.

The next few strikes came fast. One to the wrist, another to the thigh. Not meant to kill. Meant to disable.

Jack pivoted hard, staff whirling, trying to gain space. ‚ÄúWhat do you want with the church!?‚Äù the attacker barked.

His voice was low, guttural. Forced. Like he was trying not to sound like himself.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got this all wrong,‚Äù Jack growled, parrying a downward slice.

But the man wasn‚Äôt listening.

He came again, low and fast, his blade flashing. Jack managed to deflect the blow and land a crackling jab to the man‚Äôs shoulder, but it didn‚Äôt slow him down. This wasn‚Äôt some back-alley thug. This guy fought like he knew the depths of true pain. Like he knew how to move through it.

Jack ducked a swing and countered, landing a solid hit to the man‚Äôs gut. But their attacker absorbed the blow, twisting with it, grabbing the staff and nearly ripping it from Jack‚Äôs hands.

‚ÄúWho do you work for?‚Äù Jack demanded.

The man paused, looming in the glow of the staff‚Äôs flame. ‚ÄúA ronin has no master.‚Äù

Then he was on them again.

Jack fought like a cornered animal, fire flaring from their limbs, but they were losing ground. The Ronin was faster, more brutal, and he wasn‚Äôt hesitating.

Then Jack felt it.

A pressure behind their eyes. A crawling static at the base of their skull. The sky opened above them, and there it was.

A comet.

Bright. Fast. At just the worst time.

Jack‚Äôs heart spasmed in their chest, but the fear wouldn‚Äôt come. Devilmode numbed it. Still, something primal twisted in their gut. They knew what came next.

‚ÄúGet away from me!‚Äù they yelled, staggering back and fearing what Lucifer would do to him.

The Ronin paused, blade raised. ‚ÄúWhat do you‚Äî?‚Äù

Jack didn‚Äôt wait to explain. They turned, sprinting toward the edge of the rooftop, lungs full of fire, and leapt.

The wind tore past them as they plummeted into the alley shadows below.

Behind them, the Ronin stood at the ledge, watching them vanish.

And above it all, the comet burned on.

A good friend of mine is hosting a small, thoughtful event for kids (ages 9‚Äì14) to explore different career paths through fun, rotating conversations with professionals.

I‚Äôll be one of the speakers, and I think it‚Äôs a really cool concept ‚Äî kids will sit at small ‚Äúcareer tables‚Äù and get to chat with people in totally different fields. It‚Äôs all about showing them there‚Äôs no one right path to success, and helping them think beyond the usual ‚Äúwhat do you want to be when you grow up?‚Äù question.

With everything changing so fast (especially with AI), we need to be showing kids how to use their strengths in creative, nontraditional ways ‚Äî not just memorize and repeat.

It‚Äôs a chill 2-hour event. While the kids are learning and connecting, parents can hang out, enjoy music from a DJ, and sip on coffee/tea.

Also, ticket proceeds go toward a free summer program for foster youth ‚Äî something the organizer deeply cares about.

Belinda once lived in a very different house.

Yes, we're mid-transmission, so now I can use this page as a kind of running commentary. Because although we have tons of BTS footage and *Unleashed* and **DWM** articles, there are still lots of unspoken facts to be shared. So off I go! I'll have to be careful - I know this issue will published after Episode 2, *Lux*, and two days before Episode 3, *The Well*. But sometimes the process goes mad. Sometimes an issue of **DWM** will arrive accidentally a week early, I think that happened at Christmas. I don't know why! Maybe a big cigar-chomping publishing magnate throws a massive lever saying, ""Nothing in the world can stop me now!"" Or maybe an underling drops a coffee in the keyboard. That's more likely. But it's beyond anyone's control, so I'll go lightly on the *Lux* stuff, in case you haven't seen it yet.

But back to *The Robot Revolution*... Yes, Belinda's house. Originally it was just Belinda alone living there. We shot it that way, and edited it, and finished the episode. But it bugged me. Isn't that house a bit big for one person? In London? How much money has Miss Belinda Chandra got? I worried that it undermined her. We're establishing a hard-working NHS nurse in London 2025, but you could have a roller-skating derby in that kitchen!

So we met, the bosses, we had a chat. We wondered, maybe her parents bought her the house? Possible. But how do we tell the viewers that? And at London prices, that still makes them millionaires. And even then, they'd get their money back by having lodgers in the other bedrooms, surely? I was very much thinking of my niece, Natalie (hiya Nat) (I don't think she reads **DWM**, farewell Nat!) who's just moved to London as a junior doctor, and she's jammed into a house-share with three mates - loving it, hating it, all the fuss about the fridge and the rota and the washing-up. Yes, I thought, that's more Belinda.

So, we decided to change it, and if any of you are interested in writing and production and that sort of thing, this is how we did it.

I did a rewrite. This was months after we'd finished, so I had to be careful and kind to the budget and resources. But I like this sort of challenge! We'd kept the kitchen set, so that was lucky. In the middle of shooting some other episode, we took Varada back to the kitchen for an hour. I invented a housemate called Tombo, named after a friend of mine. We built a little doorway for him, and that stretch of corridor for the robot to walk past the other housemate, Kristine - tiny sets, just walls, that's all we needed. And I added a line for the robot, ""Residents will remain in their rooms!"" Oh, and earlier, Kristine shouted an extra line, ""Will you keep it down? Some of us have got work in the morning!"" And then we filmed cutaway shots of the interior of the fridge - oh, the surest sign of a house-share! Everything labelled. Granola-obsessed Tombo with his furious ""TOMBO!"" We edited that together, and ta-daa! A house share instead of single occupancy, and crucially, a more believable companion for 2025, exactly how a young NHS nurse would be living. Just two more actors, a few lines in ADR, and four new shots - Tombo, Kristine-and-Robot, the fridge, and the reverse of Belinda looking into the fridge - and look, a crucially different Belinda is created. Nice!

Those were pick-ups, which are scenes shot after the official shoot has finished. There are also deleted scenes - material shot during the official shoot, but dropped in the edit. There was a very different opening for Belinda, starting on the day of her birth, with her mother, Lakshmi, and Aunty Devika... but we didn't use them, they didn't survive the first edit. It's common sense, really: a story about Belinda having a star named after her should start with Belinda having the star named after her. Simple as that. Sometimes you can't see the obvious until it's staring you in the face.

But the deleted scenes are good! Hang around, I'm sure **DWM** will cover them, and hopefully they'll be released one day soon.

As for *Lux*... well, I'm cautious of spoilers in case you haven't seen it yet, but that stayed very much as written. The greatest production problem was: a cinema in Miami? How the hell do we film the exterior?! Even as we discussed it, way before the script was written, that seemed to be a big ask. So I had separate plans in my head. Move the action to Blackpool in the 1950s. Nice, salty, atmospheric. The diner would become an all-night greasy spoon with factory workers beginning their shifts at 4am. Love a greasy spoon; Ren√©e might have seemed a bit more lonely with a halo of steam coming off that shiny chrome urn. And she wouldn't have been called Ren√©e in Blackpool, more like a Rita. So all those plans were turning...

...and then I handed in the script and our locations department said, ""Oh, it's exactly like that old cinema in Penarth! Perfect for Miami! We can use that!"" Doh. Three miles away from Bad Wolf Studios. So y'see, sometimes contingency plans aren't needed at all.

More to come next month as the running commentary continues. The truth about the Noctis Inknid. Our long history with the Orisha. Dugga Doo! The occupant of the Vault. And the issue after that, the finale rears into sight, with the Dispossessed, the Seekers, a very surprising novel, and the terrifying mysteries of the Bone Palace. So much more to come.

I had worked there less the two months, and was never given any critique regarding service or work ethic. I literally woke up today without a job, and it made me realize folks should have more insight into business they're supporting, especially when it comes to how those owner(s) choose to operate it.

Leadership is weak, gross and messy dry storage, kitchen is ran poorly, closing early constantly, just generally bad service for customers who come in during business hours (if they are open). I'd be told hours before a shift that they'd be closing early, or I'd show up to work 4 hours to close early effectively taking money out of my pocket and wasting my time. So all in all, I'm not upset about termination, more so that they feel like its justifiable to treat people like they are expendable. And with that, the customer service isn't great either.

I'm aware that they're being dogged on for their food in other subreddits, and facebook groups. This is a great place if you're 20 and need some cash while in college. This is not a properly ran business that always guarantees wage and quality customer service. I'd just thought I'd let folks know, because I constantly see people searching for jobs here.",19,1748626908.0,winstonsalem,2,0.91,False

I added him on Facebook, he reached me out and told me to add him on instagram then tried to call I ignored him then texted me via WhatsApp and said he has feelings, and quickly asked to meet. On social media He seemed confident and open, but I'm reserved and cautious.

During the date:
He showed up in traditional clothes, His body language was reserved and intense, He didn‚Äôt flirt overtly or joke excessively. Instead, he observed, asked deep questions, and was visibly nervous ‚Äî
He asked me to remove his necklace from his hand (weird test?), then gave a light high five.
He opened up fast‚Äîtalked about his ex-fianc√©e, culture, marriage, to much questions about my family, etc.
I stayed calm, didn‚Äôt overshare, and joked lightly but kept distance. 

At the end, he opend the car door silently didn‚Äôt make a flirty or casual goodbye, and reacted with internal conflict when i said ‚ÄúHave fun‚Äù ‚Äî no smooth line or exit joke. Just silence and tension. I said ‚ÄúHave fun,‚Äù and he just nodded quietly.

After the date:
I messaged him politely next day"" hi it was nice to meet you, thanks for the coffee!""‚Äîhe replied a day later with ""hi my pleasure.. see you again soon:)""
. Then he got quiet. I removed him from Instagram. He reacted on Facebook with symbolic stories and started posting old family pics + his pics with kids.
He never reached out again. But he still watches from afar‚Äîno messages.

My question:
Was this a case of love bombing then withdrawal? Or just a miscommunication because I was too composed? Cuz went on many dates but this one was different can‚Äôt get him out my mind for like 2 months :)

1kzaf24,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1kzaf24/why_is_my_money_bowl_off/,Why is my money bowl off?,"So I did a money bowl on January 2nd not really knowing what I was doing and it worked so much better than I could have imagined. It saved me hundreds if not thousands, gave me generous gifts, kept my sales of clothes and cosmetics I had no use for very afloat and even found me both an appraisal for a piece of jewelry I wanted to sell and a few sentimental items I had been looking for for years. It was nothing short of miraculous. 

  
It seemed to tire and fizzle out after about three months even though I fed it regularly, so I dismantled and redid it sometime in April. In the meanwhile I had read a lot, I had bought prosperity-inducing crystals to add to the bowl, and my former success did wonders for my confidence. I now give it an offering of coffee each Friday on top of giving it coins or a small bill, chanting and visualizing over it for a few minutes, then burning a green candle for half an hour each Thursday (got the coffee thing from Ivy Corvus's money bowl video). Only it didn't work this time...don't want to say at all because it could always be worse I guess but very, very sluggish with miniscule successes.

* Access to electricity would be a huge plus, but not required
* I‚Äôm open to paying rent for the space

Ask People to Work Against Their Better Judgment That‚Äôs the play. That‚Äôs how winners think in markets they weren‚Äôt invited into.

Forget playing it safe. Safe is where your competitors want you. They want you to be cautious. They want you to calculate risk like it‚Äôs your religion. And they want you stuck in spreadsheets while they move fast with instinct.

# Better judgment is usually fear with a marketing budget.

In competitive intelligence, ‚Äúbetter judgment‚Äù often appears wrapped in polite analysis. You‚Äôll hear stuff like:

**‚ÄúThe timing‚Äôs not right.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúLet‚Äôs wait for more data.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúThe incumbents have too much market share.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúThey raised $20M, we can‚Äôt touch that.‚Äù**

All of that sounds smart. Feels responsible. It‚Äôs also how you get left behind.

# Markets don‚Äôt reward the rational. They reward the relentless.

You don‚Äôt need to out-think the competition. You need to out-decide them. Let‚Äôs look at what happens when people¬†*don‚Äôt*¬†follow ‚Äúbetter judgment.‚Äù

# Case Study: Lalo Baby products

This team entered a market owned by legacy giants like Graco and Baby Bj√∂rn. ‚ÄúBetter judgment‚Äù would‚Äôve said:

* Brand loyalty is too strong.

* Pricing pressure is too tight.

* Retail partnerships are locked up.

But they didn‚Äôt listen. They built a cleaner design. Stripped the branding. Spoke directly to new parents, not with smiles and rainbows, but real-world parenting grit. They didn‚Äôt wait for shelf space. They launched DTC, ran ads that looked more like memes than catalogue spreads, and let the community dictate the product roadmap.

The result was that they carved out a category inside a category. Not by being ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù By being faster, scrappier, and less rational.

# Competitor analysis should make you dangerous, not cautious.

Many run competitive intelligence like they‚Äôre writing a term paper. They present threat matrices. They colour-code risk. And they rank players on outdated dimensions.

Here‚Äôs what they should be doing:

* Hunting for the weakest conviction in a competitor‚Äôs bet.
* Ask what their competitors believe might be wrong.
* Testing the edge cases‚Äîwhere the model breaks, not where it holds.
* Pressuring their assumptions, not their competitor‚Äôs marketing deck.

You don‚Äôt beat the competition with clean charts. You beat them by getting dirty first.

# Competitor analysis gets lazy because people want permission.

They want the data to say ‚ÄúGo.‚Äù They want the graphs to show green arrows. And they want the customer quotes to align in a tidy row. They want the data to make them look good. But markets don‚Äôt move on permission. They move on¬†*momentum.*

Ask any early-stage founder who broke in from nowhere. They weren‚Äôt smarter. They weren‚Äôt safer. Plus they ignored their ‚Äúbetter judgment‚Äù and asked:

>

# Example: Reprise

Enterprise SaaS demo platforms are filled with red tape. Security reviews. Integrations. Endless sales cycles. Reprise didn‚Äôt wait for anyone to hand them access. They made live sales demos editable. That‚Äôs it. No backend changes. No code. Just let sales teams mock up product flows.

The pitch didn‚Äôt sound safe. It sounded sketchy to big companies at first. But guess what? A few fast-growing SaaS companies didn‚Äôt care. They wanted speed. They ran with it. That gave Reprise proof fast enough to make everyone else take notice. They could‚Äôve waited for product-market fit surveys. They didn‚Äôt. And they went straight for product-market friction‚Äîfound the sticking points, and used them as launch fuel.

# Ask yourself: what would the smartest competitor never do?

Then build a test for it. If you‚Äôre in coffee? Open a location with no menu. If you‚Äôre in SaaS? Strip your pricing page down to one-tier. If you‚Äôre in fitness? Cancel contracts and let people quit anytime. Every market has rules that feel like the law. They‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre just leftovers from someone else‚Äôs success.

# The real analysis challenges those rules. It doesn‚Äôt preserve them.

The maths will always say no. You‚Äôll run models. The CAC won‚Äôt work. The payback will stretch too long. The LTV won‚Äôt make sense yet. And still, some founders will launch anyway. Some scrappy teams will put up a simple site, call 50 people manually, and build a business that makes no sense on paper but dominates in practice.

Why? Because while you‚Äôre respecting the math, they‚Äôre testing the margin. They‚Äôre working against better judgment.

# Here‚Äôs the part no one says out loud:

The best competitor analysts? They lie to themselves just long enough to test what others are afraid of.

They act like they know something everyone else doesn‚Äôt. Not because they‚Äôre arrogant but because confidence gets you in the room long enough to see what‚Äôs real.

* The market doesn‚Äôt care about your perfect logic.
* It cares about motion.
* It cares about timing.
* It cares about who showed up ready to bleed.

Better judgment waits. Real players go.

# Take this mindset into your next CI session:

* Stop looking for safe gaps. Look for vulnerable myths.

* Stop ranking features. Start breaking mental models.

* Stop analysing to predict. Start analysing to provoke.

Ask:

* Where are our competitors too rational?
* Where are they playing the same tape from 5 years ago?
* What assumptions are they clinging to because they¬†*used to work*?

Then, go break those assumptions. That‚Äôs where the opportunity sits.

Working against your better judgment isn‚Äôt reckless. It‚Äôs how new players get into old games. No one‚Äôs waiting for your permission. No one cares about your due diligence. Markets reward guts. Especially when everyone else is still ‚Äúwaiting for signals.‚Äù So next time your gut says, ‚ÄúThis feels risky,‚Äù

# Better judgment kills momentum. CI should start fights, not settle debates

Ask yourself, who‚Äôs it risky for? If it‚Äôs risky for the competition, too, you may be on the right track.

It's like David vs. Goliath, but Goliath has unlimited marketing budget and a team of a thousand.

Well, I just saw some numbers that suggest¬†**AI is basically giving David a laser-guided slingshot.**¬†And it's wild.

Check this out:

* Almost¬†**half (47%!)**¬†of small businesses using AI are saying they've seen a¬†*major*¬†boost in their competitive game.
* Even crazier? About¬†**1 in 8 (12.5%)**¬†are straight-up reporting they can now legitimately compete with companies WAY bigger than them. Like, stuff that seemed impossible just a few years back.

But here's where it gets even more interesting:

* Businesses that are¬†**really going all-in with AI**¬†(using it for over 50% of their marketing)? A full¬†**third of them (33.8%)**¬†feel like they're competing effectively with the giants.
* Compare that to businesses just dabbling in AI (limited use) ‚Äì only¬†**10%**¬†of them see that same competitive edge. The difference is night and day.

And ditch the idea that AI is just a Silicon Valley thing. This survey found places like¬†**Kansas, Utah, and New Mexico** are actually leading the charge for small business AI adoption! They're crushing it with over 50% of their small businesses using AI for at least a quarter of their marketing. That's significantly¬†*higher*¬†than California (26%) or New York (33%)!

This isn't just happening in fancy tech hubs; it's everywhere.¬†From small towns to big cities, local businesses are getting access to high-powered marketing tools that used to require a Madison Avenue address and a seven-figure budget.Imagine a small local coffee shop now having marketing firepower that rivals a national chain!

[The data is crystal clear](https://www.blaze.ai/blog/david-vs-goliath): when small businesses adopt AI, it's not just about saving time (though that's a HUGE perk!). It's fundamentally changing how they stack up against the big competitors. This could be a total game-changer for the entire small business landscape.

What are your thoughts on this? Are you seeing small businesses you know gaining this kind of competitive edge with AI? If you're a small business owner, how are you using AI to punch above your weight class? Let's discuss!",1,1748626537.0,BrandMarketingTips,0,1.0,False
1kzac4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/RangeRover/comments/1kzac4x/latest_update_on_my_aliexpress_android_auto_head/,Latest update on my AliExpress Android Auto head unit/entertainment system.,"It's been almost two weeks since I installed my AliExpress Android Auto head unit, and I have some likes and dislikes to share, as well as some general observations.

It definitely requires some setup, in the sense that I was starting from knowing very little about Android Auto, apart from using it a few times in various rental cars, so my learning curve was steep.

The unit itself (my specific unit, I'm not claiming any knowledge of the other versions from other companies,) still impresses me in terms of build quality; I was expecting it to be kinda cheap and have a ton of rough edges, but the screen is really nice, and the images and colors it shows are smooth and sharp. At 1920X1080P, the resolution is a nice upgrade from the stock OEM Bosch unit I had.

All the physical buttons on my steering wheel, the physical buttons for the HVAC, etc., work perfectly,except the seats button (see below for further information on that). On the music end of things, the physical volume buttons work exactly as they should, the track forward and back controls, also work perfectly. The stock rear-view camera is still in place, and it too, works perfectly; because the screen is a lot bigger than stock, the rear view is FAR better, and far more useful than it was on the stock screen.

The steering wheel phone call button does what it should, the mode button goes to the OEM menu screen and works, and lets me switch sources, etc. The voice commands button likewise functions as it should.

If I press the physical climate button, the system switches to the OEM climate screen and gives me all the choices it should, including the seat controls, seat heat and cooling. The only button that DOESN'T work, is the seats physical button; that does nothing, but since the climate button does, it's no big deal to me.

When I bough the unit, the vendor told me that the 4G SIM system wouldn't work in the USA, due to some kind of system compatibility issue. As an engineery kind of person, I decided to experiment anyway. After trying 5 different SIM vendors, I found one that DOES WORK! I'm getting full 4G functionality, streaming, Web access, Maps and all apps, including YouTube, etc. Very happy!

Before getting the 4G to work, I had just used my Android phone to act as a hot-spot, then connected the AliExpress unit to my phone via Wi-Fi, and that also works flawlessly.

In the two weeks, I haven't had a single glitch, misbehavior or weirdness happen with the unit; the connection has been ultra stable, no droupouts during music playback, all Nav functions work, no freezing or lag. The Android Auto connection is accomplished through an App that's included with the AliExpress unit. The unit also has a GPS tool, and a few other things that are embedded into it.

The unit allows me to install all Google Play store apps I need. So far all of them work as designed, including Tidal, YouTube, a Weather app that tells me the weather via speech.

The conclusion I have reached, is that despite my pessimism, and some of the stories of people being less than happy with these kinds of units, I'm personally very pleased with it. The only real slight criticism I have, is that I THINK (not totally sure, because I'm not putting the old OEM unit back in,) that there might be a slightly higher noise floor (hum) than with the stock unit, but it's only noticeable if I have been playing music at very high volumes, and them turn the music off, but leave the volume control on; I seldom do that anyway.

Bottom line is that I would definitely do this again. It does everything I wanted it to do, and more.

If anyone wants to try doing what I have done, I'd be more than happy to be a resource and help. The key is to watch the install video a few times, get yourself the correct trim tools (dirt cheap from Amazon, and a good investment generally.)

This is NOT very difficult (for the L405 at least!) It does require patience and enough time available, so you don't have to rush the install.

TAKE YOUR TIME, take a tea or coffee break every so often, don't panic, be VERY detail orientated, wrap cables up with zip ties/electrical tape, tuck the cables away into the little nooks and crannies so that they won't get crushed or overly bent/contorted. When you are removing and re-installing the circuit boards from the old OEM unit into the new unit, pay attention to the GPS and 4G cables and connectors, they're fiddly, and I had to use a magnifying glass to get the connectors back on correctly without damaging them (my eyesight isn't great at near vision.)",2,1748626516.0,RangeRover,0,1.0,False

She also mentioned she‚Äôs on dating apps both to potentially find a relationship and to explore her relationship to sex as a sex-favorable asexual person. She added that, if and when sex is involved, she tends to be more dominant (her words).

We had a great first meet. It was a mid-day coffee and we just got to know each other, so the topic of sex didn‚Äôt naturally come up.

I‚Äôm posting here to ask for advice around discussing these kinds of topics in a respectful and considerate way.

Beautifully kept- with trees so vibrant and skies so clear, you‚Äôd think someone had turned up the saturation. Not only that, but this place has one extra perk that trumps them all.

No one ever used to use it. From what I can understand, it‚Äôs a gamble- and a very expensive one at that.

I also know there's something alive under my neighborhood. No one here has ever seen whatever or whoever it is, but we all know it's there. 

Superstitions have never had any hold on me. Walking under a ladder, breaking a mirror, and black cats were no more special to me than any other mundane aspect of my life. Sure, I thought the idea of it was cute- a story to inject a little bit of magic into the lives of children- but, just like Santa Claus, there was no truth behind them in my eyes.

It's the reason I was so surprised when I moved to my new neighborhood- the one with the wishing well behind the old church. I could see it from my window- sitting abandoned across the street. 

Even as a child, I understood that the purpose of fairy tales was to bring joy, mystery, or some other moral lesson to the listeners. They were a positive thing. 

So, why then did everyone here act like this? Why is it a taboo to even speak about the well? 

The day I moved in, there was no welcoming party. No friendly neighbors to greet me like in my old town. There was only a note taped to my front door, and even that was blunt, 

‚ÄúYou will only be warned once. The well is not to be used. Stay away from it.‚Äù

It wasn't signed or addressed, but I chalked it up to a crazy neighbor. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to forget all about it.

This suburban town was a lot quieter than the city life I had come from, but I didn't mind it. I kept to myself, mostly. Always have. Easier that way, especially after things fell apart with my sister. We hadn‚Äôt spoken in years.

The neighbors were friendly and despite living alone, I never felt lonely. There was nothing out of the ordinary- with the exception of that one small, looming detail.

Anytime the well was mentioned, no matter by who, people's smiles would drop like a sinking stone. The subject would immediately be changed and if it wasn‚Äôt, people would simply excuse themselves from the conversation. I learned this the hard way when I made the mistake of asking about the well at a barbecue I had been invited to. 

I may as well have insulted the dead, the way everyone stared. My host pulled me aside to another room, I could hear the chattering continue as soon as I left. They explained to me only that the well was not up for conversation. I asked why, and I was then asked to leave.

From that day on I figured I‚Äôd play along. I mean, everyone was friendly enough and I didn‚Äôt really care about the well. Why not just let it be?

The next week, that same neighbor invited me out for coffee-two towns over. I found it annoying. I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to socialize, and they knew I had nothing else going on that day, which made it hard to come up with an excuse without seeming rude. Still, curiosity won out.

That‚Äôs when I finally got something-some version of the truth, anyway. It wasn‚Äôt much. Vague, cautious, and watered down. But it was more than anyone else had been willing to say.

In a hushed voice, they told me people here are afraid of the well. It‚Äôs older than the neighborhood. Older than the church. Maybe even older than the town itself. No one maintains it-no one dares-yet it never changes. The bricks never crumble. Plants don‚Äôt grow over it. There‚Äôs no mold, no moss. Even the birds won‚Äôt perch on its edge.

I didn‚Äôt believe a word of it.

Ironically, I think my unbelief in the supernatural is what saved me from it at first.

It started with a man a few houses down. I didn‚Äôt know him well, but I‚Äôd seen him out on his porch most days-usually with a drink in hand and a tired look in his eyes. One day, he stopped showing up. A neighbor whispered that he‚Äôd lost his job. Another said he was about to lose the house too.

Then, one night, someone saw him at the well. Drunk. Talking to it like it was a priest or a god or an old friend. He tossed a coin down and made a wish.

A week later, he won the lottery. Half a million dollars. Just like that.

No one said it out loud-not at first. But everyone knew. The timing was too perfect. The man who‚Äôd been sleeping in his car was now driving a brand-new SUV. Wearing a gold watch. Talking about moving to Florida.

It took time, but slowly‚Ä¶ people started getting brave.

A coin. A wish. A new car in the driveway.

A coin. A wish. A promotion no one had seen coming.

A coin. A wish. A woman who‚Äôd been in hospice walked out of her house two weeks later, smiling like nothing had ever been wrong.

No one ever admitted it. No one talked about it. But the silence in this neighborhood started to feel different. Not cautious‚Ä¶ expectant.
Like everyone was waiting their turn. 

The tricky part about gambling is that it is a trick in and of itself. A game of russian roulette. But the rewards were too sweet to resist. 

The next wish didn‚Äôt go as well. 

I actually knew this one personally. Dale. He lived at the very end of the street. 

The kind of man who owned three cars and made sure you knew about each of them. Loud voice, louder opinions. People saw him that night, dressed too nice for a midnight stroll. Holding a coin the size of a silver dollar. He made a big show of dropping it in.

The next morning, his front door was wide open, swinging on its hinges. The inside looked like a tornado had blown through the house. Shattered glass littered the floor, the furniture was overturned and torn, and a trail of dark streaks led from the stairs to the door. They smelled like mud and mildew. 

No one has seen Dale since. We did, however, find his wedding ring caked in mud on the ground outside.

I should mention that, the morning Dale disappeared, there was a 4th car in his driveway: a bright blue Bugatti Veyron. Brand new. Clean. Keys still in the ignition. Expensive even for someone like him. 

After Dale, things went quiet again.

No more coins. No more wishes.

The Bugatti sat in his driveway for a week before it disappeared-towed in the middle of the night by someone no one seemed to recognize. No paperwork. No questions.

People stopped talking about the well entirely. Conversations grew stiff when it came up, then stopped altogether. Barbecues resumed. Lawns were trimmed. Porch lights flicked on at the usual times.

It was as if Dale had never existed.

That was the rhythm of this place. A quick flirtation with the forbidden, followed by complete, willful silence. No one warned newcomers anymore. They just watched-waited to see who would get curious first.

I never intended for that to be me, but my mind was made for me.

I got the call late at night: a drunk driver, an intersection, and my sister. She was alive, for now, but in critical condition. 

I rushed to the hospital to see her, but they wouldn‚Äôt let me in the room. They gave me the usual spiel. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything we can.‚Äù 

But I saw it in their eyes. She was a goner.

The drive home felt unreal. I loved my sister, despite the silence, despite the petty fight. I never stopped. I just never said it.

The doctor‚Äôs words rang in my head again. ‚ÄúDoing all we can.‚Äù But I wasn‚Äôt. 

There was still one thing I hadn‚Äôt done. One thing I could still do.

The rest of my drive home was spent calculating and justifying what I knew I was going to do next.

Five wishes had been made. Of those, only one ended badly.

A one-in-five chance to save her.

It was past midnight by the time I pulled into the driveway.

The neighborhood was still. No wind, no barking dogs, not even the distant hum of cars. Just that heavy kind of silence that feels like it‚Äôs listening.

I stood outside my front door for a long time, keys in hand, staring across the yard.

The well sat behind the church, tucked just beyond the fence line. It was barely visible from my house-just a ring of brick swallowed in shadow. But tonight, I could see it clearly. As if it wanted to be seen.

I didn‚Äôt go inside.

I walked.

Each step felt heavier than the last, like the air thickened the closer I got. The grass underfoot was damp even though it hadn‚Äôt rained in days. The church loomed to my right, its windows dark. I half expected to see someone watching me from inside-but there was nothing.

Just me and the well.

I reached into my pocket and found a coin I hadn‚Äôt remembered putting there. A dull penny. I almost laughed. My sister's life, in exchange for this? But it wasn‚Äôt about the coin. It never was. 
I stepped forward. Cleared my throat.
My voice shook, but I forced the words out.
‚ÄúI want my sister to live.‚Äù
The coin dropped.
There was no sound. No splash. Just an endless silence.
I backed away from the well slowly, like with a wild animal, and spent the rest of the night by my phone, waiting for a call. 

I didn‚Äôt sleep.

I sat on the couch with the curtains cracked just enough to see outside. The well was just a silhouette-unmoving, undisturbed. I watched it like a hawk, as if it might change its mind and spit the coin back out.

I started writing this sometime around 3 a.m., while I was still waiting for the hospital to call. I didn‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever get the call, or if something else would happen first. I just needed to get it all down-just in case.

The phone finally rang just after 6 a.m.

I fumbled it to my ear before the second ring. My heart was already halfway out of my chest.

It was the hospital.

She was awake.

Stable. Breathing on her own. Responding to questions.

The nurse called it a miracle.

I didn‚Äôt speak for a full ten seconds. Just held the phone to my ear and listened to the sound of the universe tipping sideways.

I thanked them. I don‚Äôt remember what else I said. I just know I was smiling when I hung up.

And then I looked out the window.

Someone is peeking over the wall of the well-looking me right in the eyes. Skin white like paper. Bloated, like a waterlogged corpse. Every few minutes it moves a little-an inch here, a twitch there-but it never stops staring.

It‚Äôs leaving the well slowly.
A hand over the edge.
Then an arm.
Now I can see its mouth. Or the beginning of it, anyway.

It‚Äôs vertical.
It starts at its lips and runs down its throat, a long seam that splits its head in half. I can‚Äôt see how far it goes. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll find out very soon.

I already tried running.
When I went to the door, it was there.

I saw it through the peephole. Just standing on the other side, gasping-bubbling like something drowning in its own breath. Its skin dripped black water that pooled on my porch.

But when I backed away, panicked, and looked out the window again-
it was still by the well.

My front porch was empty.

Unlucky as it is, I made this gamble. My sister gets to live and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important. I just hope she sees this so she can know I‚Äôm sorry. ",3,1748625989.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

He's figured this out, and is about to use it against me.","I had gotten through half the cup of coffee before I realized that the beans were rotten. I reflected on the knowledge that my child was about to be kidnapped, vaguely accepted that I deserved all the worst life had to offer, and downed the rest, scalding my tongue. 

‚ÄúDo you think Daniel‚Äôs going to die?‚Äù I asked my wife.

She didn‚Äôt answer. Cindy just stared out the window at a world soaked in sunlight, sipping her own cup of coffee. I knew that she heard me. She knew that I knew it.

[I wondered how much my son was suffering at that moment and pondered making another pot](https://redd.it/1kth2mz).

It could have been nineteen hours or thirteen minutes later when the phone rang. Time had gotten funny. It cut through tension, but I didn‚Äôt jump, because being on edge is a mechanism for beings that want to survive. Cindy put her cell phone on speaker.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs done. As requested, we are going to use extreme measures. You remember the Golden Rule?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can call and stop at any time,‚Äù Cindy answered in a voice devoid of human soul. ‚ÄúHe will be returned within the hour. No refunds.‚Äù

My mind wandered to the time that Daniel had gotten ahold of the neighbor‚Äôs labradoodle, and how she had screamed upon seeing what he‚Äôd done to it.

‚ÄúYou think you can change him?‚Äù Cindy asked. I heard a glimmer of hope in her voice, and that made my stomach flip. Hope was dangerous. 

‚ÄúNo guarantees and no refunds.‚Äù The call ended.

I looked at her. We rarely did that at this point in our marriage. ‚ÄúDo you think there‚Äôs an afterlife?‚Äù

She stared through me. ‚ÄúI only decided to go through this after convincing myself that hell isn‚Äôt real.‚Äù

We sat at the kitchen table. I tried to remember the last time anyone in my family had said that we loved one another, and I couldn‚Äôt remember. That was probably for the best.

Again, we didn‚Äôt jump when the phone rang. I didn‚Äôt like receiving a phone call this soon after the previous one, because I knew that my son would take days to break. I wanted no news.

Cindy‚Äôs hand was shaking when she put the phone on speaker.

At first, there was nothing. 

Then I heard Daniel‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúMother. Father.‚Äù He sounded very calm. ‚ÄúWhy did you do this? More pertinent, why did you think that this man was able to contain me?‚Äù

And suddenly, I felt fear again. I guess I wasn‚Äôt completely dead after all.

‚ÄúDaniel?‚Äù Cindy squeaked. 

‚ÄúHe had every vile torture tool I could ever want, right here in this horrible little room. I‚Äôm going to leave him like this, still alive, because it will take days for him to die. It excites me to think of how much pain that will cause him, and how his body will be digesting its own ear and its own eyeball while it withers.‚Äù

It‚Äôs funny how a broken mind works: one of my foremost thoughts was that Daniel had always displayed a rich vocabulary for an eight-year-old.

‚ÄúI will now take those tools with me. Please run away, Mother and Father, because I am excited for the chase. Remember that there‚Äôs nothing you can do. What will you tell the police? That you paid to have me tortured? If they pick me up, I will cry and beg to be reunited with my Mama and my Papa. No matter what happens, I will be with you again, and I will bring these horrible tools so that I can play with you. There is no hope.

She was going to a local doctor and they started on Folfinox. It worked for a while, as her CA-19 levels decreased and the tumor shrank slightly. However, the cancer remains wrapped around her main artery so they can not perform the Whipple. We encouraged her to go to a more specialized hospital so she started seeing a new oncologist at UTSW. UTSW has a great reputation, however, I'm afraid the doctor they assigned her to is not qualified to handle pancreatic cancer (she studied hematology).

Her doctor went on pregnancy leave for three months and during that time they assigned my SIL to a PA. They continued Folfinox, but my SIL was not tolerating it well (never has, really). She has lost A LOT of weight, now down 100 pounds. She is now so weak she can barely walk to her kitchen and get coffee. She is constantly throwing up (even two weeks after her chemo), never eats, and now has some incontinence. Her CA-19 has been rising rapidly each time, over 3,000 in one month. Now her liver blood work is looking even worse, and for the first time, her bilirubin is high along with AST, ALT, and ALP. She had a CT scan two weeks ago, and it showed the tumor was more or less stable (though I find CT scans to be highly subjective); however, as we all know, it does not pick up on microscopic spread. We are concerned, based on her labs, that it is now metastasizing. Her doctor continues to say that the chemo is working and she will live over a year. I am shocked as to how this doctor has come to this conclusion. She refuses to change her chemo regimen even though it makes my SIL sicker, and her markers keep increasing. Obviously, it's not working any longer. I'm sorry, but this doctor seems incompetent to me. Based on her labs and her physical state, why would a doctor think she is improving?!?!

My (22f) best friend John (23m) and I have been friends since we were kids. As kids we were very close and we had a fake wedding when we were 7 and 8. In high school we recreated the fake wedding pics and he had one of those pics in his wallet.

Since he got with his gf Dinah (23f) around two years ago John has distanced himself from me. We still hang out but I feel like he always makes time for Dinah first instead of me. The only way I can see him now is if we go grab coffee once every few days but other than that he won't come to my house when we used to have sleepovers and movie nights and won't invite me to his house either. I feel neglected and hurt because we've been inseparable since we were small kids.

Couple of days ago I grabbed coffee with him at a coffee shop and when he opened his wallet to grab his card and pay I noticed he had put a pic of him and Dinah in the place he had our fake wedding pic. I asked him about it and pointed out how I noticed to which the only thing he said was ""what about it?"" I was like really? Why did you have to take our picture out and replace it with him and Dinah? He said Dinah is his gf and he doesn't understand why I'm making such a big deal about it. I reminded him she might be his gf but he can't just throw me away, I've been his best friend since primary school, my pic existed in his wallet first and he throws it away to replace me with someone he knows significantly less?

He got annoyed and told me that once I stop being an immature annoying brat he'll talk to me again, until then I better leave him to his peace because he's not dealing with my ""childish"" tantrum.

AITA here?

This post is for a more targeted audience since I feel like a lot of this sub is ""eat and cook fresh"" - but sometimes, that's really, really hard. I've gotten some judgment implying I'm not taking my conditions seriously and I'm tired of that conversation and want the people who get it. **Shaming and snark and insensitivity will be ignored here.**

I'm an autistic mom of a 2 year old and 6m, struggle with non-anaphylactic MCAS, mild POTS (right now...) and histamine, sulfite and dairy intolerance, and live in a mixed cultural (Mexican) household where a lot of the food preferences contain onions, paprika + spicy, tomatoes, which I've been doing my best to avoid. Tomatoes, onions and garlic seem to be the worst culprits for me.  I have eliminated dairy at least and kept major triggers pretty limited. I opt for black tea instead of coffee. Fortunately, beans don't bother me, so I can tolerate those. I just don't want to eat beans and rice every day. I take Famotidine and Claritin twice a day per my doctor. 

I also struggled with some anorexia growing up, and eating feels like a chore (for me, obviously not providing for others), and that really starts to kick in when I feel overstimulated. That said I need to cook and provide for my family and myself, there's no stepping off the metaphorical train. I am trying to cook separate things for myself since I definitely can't have everything they can.

When I'm overwhelmed, there are times I just don't eat. That's not sustainable at all. In the past I would eat just straight Mac n cheese on a rough day but that's not happening now üòÖ I've been supplementing with Ensures to *ensure* I get some more substance in my body.

Okay, I could go on. I'm hoping that paints the picture. 

Please, for those of you who can relate at least to part of this, WHAT do you DO?! Even if you don't have advice, feel free to commiserate with me. ü•≤

Wishing you well, friends.

Drank a cup of chicken broth for the salt (20 calories) and had diarrhea 30 minutes later. Learned my lesson. 

Didn't take measurements before I started but clothes are definitely looser. I enjoy seeing the number on the scale go down every morning, and I enjoy logging my workouts and water intake. 

Tiny cheats along the way:

1. I have 2Tbsp of heavy cream in my coffee every day but it takes all day to drink 20oz so I'm not worried about the calories. 

2. I eat half a slice of low carb bread before I take my meds and supplements at night, cuz my stomach doesn't like them when it's so empty. It's 15 calories and 1/2 carb. Who cares?

3. If I'm starving I eat a dill pickle spear. 5 calories, big whoop. 

4. Cheated with a bite of cheese when I was lightheaded the other day. Oh well.

Over the past day or so, I tried to get direct answers from the WhiteRock team about their claims of partnerships with **BlackRock, Visa, MasterCard, and Nasdaq**.

This is a follow up to this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteRock\_Fi/comments/1kz5jo2/why\_are\_we\_not\_seeing\_verified\_partnerships\_where/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteRock_Fi/comments/1kz5jo2/why_are_we_not_seeing_verified_partnerships_where/)

I wasn‚Äôt aggressive, I wasn‚Äôt accusatory. I asked:

* Are these partnerships real?
* Can we verify them with public info from those companies?
* If it‚Äôs not a formal partnership, what exactly do phrases like *‚Äúbuilt with‚Äù* or *‚Äúintegrated with‚Äù* mean?

**What I got back:**

* On **Telegram**, I was **banned** for asking this exact question:""Where is the proof that WhiteRock is partnered with BlackRock, Nasdaq, Visa, and Mastercard?""
* On **Discord**, I was met with vague answers, metaphors (""Does water tell coffee it's not a partnership?""), and mild gaslighting (like being told my respectful questions showed signs of being ""unstable"" or ""extreme.)""
* A few community members agreed the claims were unclear, but anyone who pushed further was met with defensiveness or told to leave if they didn‚Äôt like it.

**Red Flags That Stood Out:**

* **No official verification** from any of the companies mentioned.
* **Marketing language** like ‚Äúbuilt with‚Äù or ‚Äúintegrates with‚Äù used to imply partnerships with no distinction made between a business integration and an actual agreement.
* **Mods deleting messages** and banning users for asking simple questions.
* **Over-polished marketing** paired with vague, unverifiable claims. A classic combo.

**My Takeaway:**

I‚Äôm not here to call anything a scam. I hope the project delivers. But if a team **can‚Äôt handle basic investor questions**, and if major partnership claims **can‚Äôt be verified**, that‚Äôs not just a red flag, it‚Äôs a choice.

**In crypto, asking for proof isn‚Äôt disrespect. It‚Äôs responsibility.**

Happy to answer questions or provide the full transcript of the conversation (what is left since the mods deleted a number of my messages) if anyone's curious. Sharing this so others can go in with their eyes open.

Got her an inexpensive DeLonghi machine years ago. Similar to this unit: Stilosa Espresso Machine by Delonghi - EC260BK: 15-Bar Pressure, Frothing Wand, Removable Water Reservoir, Dishwasher-Safe Parts : Target

I'm looking to get an upgrade as she's gotten more into cappuccino's and that unit is starting to get a bit weak. I've seen some recommendations on the Breville 870 being a good ""entry level"" unit to start making some good cups. I've also see it recommended to go with a different unit and separate grinder since the 870 grinder is a low point.

Looking be somewhere between $500-1000 I think. Would like for it to be easy enough to clean and keep in good condition. Will also be something she'll keep for a while. We usually only make cappuccino's on the weekend so 4-5 cups a week. May increase a tad but nothing crazy from our standpoint. Just looking to get her something nicer that gets a bit closer to that cup she may get at the local pastry/coffee shop.

It's to a point where I'm stuck in a self reflecting spiral, constantly asking myself ""what is wrong with me?"". I've only ever had one real relationship and it was last year. It only lasted a month, because my ex said he couldn't do long distance. I was gutted. I felt like I would never find anyone again, especially since it took me until I was 20 to find someone in the first place. 

Anyway, after months of healing and getting back on my feet, I started looking to meet new people. I did a stupid, stupid thing (downloaded Hinge) and for weeks, it was the same terrible cycle. I'd match with someone, we would talk a lot for about a week, then they would disappear from the face of the earth. After a few ghosts, I thought to myself ""maybe I'm just not initiating enough?"" So I started being more bold, asking them out to coffee dates. So we could get to know each other in person rather than over texts. Twice I did this, and both times... ghosted. 

Okay... so maybe Hinge isn't my thing. I started going out into the Real World (scary) and becoming more sociable than I've been in my entire life. I mean... talking to strangers in grocery stores and coffee shops. Striking up conversation with cashiers and waiters. This is a big deal for me, because I've had terrible social anxiety my entire life. Still, most people seem to try and get the conversation over as quickly as possible, like ripping off a bandaid. 

I'm just at a loss. Maybe I put off weird vibes? I've had friends tell me I looked very intimidating until they got to know me. I think I'm fairly attractive(?) I get a LOT of compliments from women. Never men though. Maybe it's because I was homeschooled growing up and they can sense that. Fuck!!!!

1kz9pec,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1kz9pec/help_with_meals/,Help With Meals,"I posted in here the other day regarding my situation and figured I‚Äôd try to get some additional advice on meals:

Typical Meals:

Breakfast if Working in the Office- Medium Iced Coffee caramel and 1 cream from either Dunkin or Starbucks. Bagel with cream cheese. 
Breakfast from Home - 2 eggs, 2 turkey sausage, 2 pieces of wheat toast, hash brown patty and an iced coffee.

Lunch - Typically a turkey and cheese sandwich with a bag of chips or a snack.

Dinner - Usually jasmine rice and green beans. Rotate between salmon and chicken as well as pasta. I will definitely be mixing up veggies used moving forward. 

31 y/o Male and 185-190 pounds. Physically fit, run weekly. 226 Total Cholesterol, 150 LDL, 63 HDL and 78 Triglycerides. During my test, I also did not fast as it was a late afternoon one. I‚Äôm sure this won‚Äôt impact the numbers all that much?

Doctor told me to make sure that fruits and veggies make up 50% of diet.

My simple quick fixes that I can make are egg whites instead of regular eggs and adding some fruit as a snack mid-morning. Where I am struggling is I have tried steel cut oats/overnight oats and the texture and flavor is not cutting it for me. I‚Äôm eating it but I‚Äôm struggling through it. For context, I‚Äôm doing mixed frozen berries, 1/4 steel cut oats, 1/4 oat milk, 2.5 flax seeds. I‚Äôm not the biggest salad fan but would certainly be open to finding ways to start to make it manageable for me. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for making this more doable for breakfast? Also trying to mix in smoothies and cannot master that either. Lunch is an area I‚Äôm struggling with because I cannot figure out what to meal prep to bring in to the office. Have not really eaten much more than brown rice and beans this past week. Dinner ideas as well but I think that will be my easier of the fixes.

I have been told by literally everyone that I am going too hard out of the gate with changes that I‚Äôm going to burn out. Also have a tree nut allergy so cannot do anything with those. 

I am also going on a vacation with friends next week so a bit concerned about that as there will very likely be some drinking involved and I am going to do my best to at least make sure to pick meals that don‚Äôt really hurt me. I haven‚Äôt really had many ‚Äúcheat meals‚Äù since finding out about my high LDL and have lost 6-8 pounds which probably isn‚Äôt the most healthy way to do it.

It accidentally improved my life.,"May is the International Masturbation Month. I set myself a personal challenge to do 200 orgasms in May. That's 200 individual wanks in a month.

That goes to be around 6,45 orgasms per day. And you don‚Äôt get those kinds of numbers without dedication. Or planning for that sake.

After some days, I realized that spontaneous sessions weren‚Äôt going to cut it. I was already falling behind. So I did what any responsible adult would do: I made a schedule. Looking back I should have known better. When I did the 12 in 24 hour challenge, I had to schedule my wanks to accomplish it.

So I wrote down approxemently times in my calendar like it was a workout plan:

* 07:30: ""Good morning Creampuff""
* 10:15: ""After coffee release""
* 13:00: "" Lunchpie""
* 16:00: ""Productivity Booster""
* 19:30: ""Evening load into Creampuff""
* 22:30: ""The Goodnight wank""

And sometimes a 3AM I got the ""the wet dream"" experience.

My Fleshlight, Creampuff, eventually started asking for vacation days. I denied here request.

It worked. Not just for the challenge (which I‚Äôm on track to complete). But for my actual life also. I got more things done. I got less anxious because I knew what was coming for me each day. I started eating regularly (witch is good for me). My screen time went down. I even cleaned my home sometimes in the waiting period.

Scheduling my orgasms actually gave me a reason to structure my day. I woke up earlier with motivation to do my ""job"". I don't have to job right now so that was nice. And somehow, in the middle of all this May challange chaos, I have became a better version of myself.

Im proud of myself today. I am really nailing this challenge and I don't care what anyone else think about this achievement. Stop hiding things that make you feel good.

TL;dr: Aiming for the 200 orgasms in May challenge. Started scheduling them like meetings. Accidentally improved my mental health, productivity, and daily routine. I don't give a fuck what you think of this achievement.",3,1748624871.0,copypasta,0,0.71,False

1kz9hu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kz9hu3/depression_has_taken_everything_from_me_im/,"Depression has taken everything from me, I‚Äôm drowning and my whole life is falling apart","I‚Äôm not sure what to expect posting this but I don‚Äôt have anyone to speak to. Sorry for the long read in advance.

I had a panic attack yesterday and I didn‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about it. I‚Äôve been feeling incredibly isolated lately and it hasn‚Äôt helped I‚Äôve had to deal with a lot without support. Most of the time, I‚Äôm on my own with my thoughts. I used to have a support system but over the past couple of years things have slowly fallen apart. I‚Äôve lost all my friends, don‚Äôt have any family support, have had to give up on uni because of my depression, so it feels like everything‚Äôs crumbling apart and what little I had left to look forward to is gone. I‚Äôve had to give up on the one career goal/dream I had, which required my degree. I put so much into making sure I‚Äôd be good enough for this role once I got my degree including doing loads of work experience and now it‚Äôs all over and I won‚Äôt be able to pursue this career anymore.

Right now I‚Äôm going through a lot and dealing with it all on my own. There‚Äôs the stress of being kicked out by my family soon because of not finishing uni and them going on about how I wasted all the opportunities they gave me, money worries and just this constant feeling that I‚Äôm losing everything bit by bit. I did have a counsellor but I can‚Äôt carry on cause of the cost and I need to save up as much as I can for when I get kicked out. Still spoke to him this week but I can‚Äôt keep booking sessions even though it was the only time during the week I had to look forward to where I could speak to someone for a bit. I won‚Äôt have anywhere to go in the next couple of months when my family find out about the uni situation and I‚Äôll need to find somewhere to live but everything is expensive and I don‚Äôt have anywhere to crash whilst I get back on my feet. I try to keep myself distracted and hold it together, especially at work, but when I‚Äôm off or alone it really hits me how empty things feel. I‚Äôd love to travel and catch a break for a bit but I can‚Äôt afford to. I currently have a part time job and although it can be hard to go in on the days I‚Äôm really struggling, I enjoy the chats I have with my colleagues and it‚Äôs the only time I really get to speak to anyone in person. The job is only contracted till July so I‚Äôve only got about 5 weeks (15days ish) left and I won‚Äôt have anyone to speak to irl once I finish until I find a new job and idk how long that will take.

I‚Äôm applying for jobs I‚Äôm not even interested in and don‚Äôt really have any other choice just so I have an income for now but keep getting rejected, I‚Äôve tried retail, supermarkets, admin and any other type of job that I can do. The issue is that most decent jobs require degrees and the ones that don‚Äôt, I know will have a tonne of applications so the chances of progressing with the applications are even slimmer.

I don‚Äôt want to be a burden on anyone but days like today feel unbearable without anyone to reach out to. I just wish things felt a bit less heavy and that I didn‚Äôt feel so invisible. I wish I actually mattered to people. At first I thought maybe it was the depression lying to me but the past year especially I‚Äôve come to realise how alone I really am. I didn‚Äôt have anyone to spend my birthday with or new years or any other event. I‚Äôve come to realise that people often don‚Äôt reciprocate the efforts and energy put into friendships and will give different amounts, but it feels like I‚Äôve always been the one to give more and now that I can‚Äôt it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm no use to anyone. It‚Äôs not even like I was constantly telling people about how much I was struggling, I knew if I did it would push them away so I‚Äôd keep it bottled up but they ended up leaving anyway. I‚Äôve always been the person people come to with their problems or whenever they need to vent but I don‚Äôt have anyone I can do the same with. I have one person I feel like I‚Äôm able to be open with about this stuff but don‚Äôt want to drain her of her energy when she already has her own life, and things have changed recently and she can‚Äôt always be there to talk to even about regular stuff. Things won‚Äôt go back to how they were for a while because of external factors but she‚Äôs the only person who gave good advice and felt like she fully understood me. It‚Äôs times like this I just wish I had someone to chat to, not even about the heavy stuff, but for a distraction so I could stop thinking about how bad things have gotten. Someone I could share reels/memes or go for walks or a coffee with but it‚Äôs so hard making new friends and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm interesting enough for people anymore. I‚Äôve tried going to social events off insta but I don‚Äôt really click with anyone.

Ive been trying so hard to get through without the help I can‚Äôt seem to find and get out of the rut myself but something always pulls me back to this place. I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôve done nothing with my life. Maybe people are right and it‚Äôs my fault for not being able to just get on with things and make the most of the opportunities I wasted. Someone else could‚Äôve done so much more with the opportunities I‚Äôve been given in my life yet I just fucked it up like I fuck everything up.

# Why I built this:

Existing torrent apps/websites felt bloated, slow, or cluttered with spams. As a dev, I wanted something minimal yet powerful, so I went back to basics:

* **Pure Native Java**: No frameworks, no bloat. Just raw Java for maximum performance.
* **Instant Results**: Searches torrents in milliseconds (around 600ms) and shows results in under 2 seconds.
* **Lightweight**: runs smoothly even on low-end devices.
* **Huge Library**: Aggregates results from multiple sources and have backup sources as fallbacks.

* **Thread-Optimized Crawlers**: Parallel fetching without blocking the UI.

TL;DR: What is an appropriate communication cadence when you are both busy professionals with kids?

I‚Äôve recently reconnected with someone I went on a couple of dates with last year. I have meetings occasionally in the building she works in downtown so we grabbed a coffee after my meeting a couple of weeks ago, and then lunch yesterday.

I can‚Äôt tell how interested she is based on her communication style though. She texts back every couple of days, but it is always me initiating it. For example, she hadn‚Äôt replied in a few days after having coffee so I thought she wasn‚Äôt interested. I took a chance and told her I would be in her office building for a meeting yesterday so she enthusiastically agreed to lunch and we had a really good time.

Historically I go 100mph when talking to someone, and I‚Äôve valued someone who wants to be chased over someone who is open and interested in me.  I‚Äôve been trying to slow down my anxious attachment though and practice healthier relationships. The problem is, after going from a style of texting all day every day with someone, and chasing them down, then panicking and running when they get too close to me, I don‚Äôt know what a healthy conversational cadence looks like with someone.

I‚Äôm enjoying getting to know her because it‚Äôs just calm. I don‚Äôt the huge emotional ups and downs of ‚Äúomg she‚Äôs the one, I have to mind meld with this person‚Äù.

Ultimately I want to know, does her cadence of replying show she is interested at all? She is incredibly busy with her job and flies all over the country so I know she is busy. I just hate a conversation dying and then restarting it in a few days.",0,1748623844.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

We just returned from a lovely \~9-day trip to Paris. I'm going to write this up like a basic day-by-day report in case any folks want to replicate any part of it. I also included our daily steps. 

A little background; we've been to France but it was our first time in Paris. I am from NYC and my wife from Puerto Rico, and we both currently reside in a mid-sized city in PA. We prioritize food and drink above all else when we travel. We fly cheap and don't care much about luxury shopping or staying in expensive hotels. We walk a lot and engage with everyone as much or as little as they want. 

We had most everything planned out pretty well, but as always, not everything goes to plan and that's ok. In my younger years, I had the ""follow the wind"" mentality, but soon realized that with such limited time on these adventures, it's important for us to maximize the experience. So we don't over plan but we definitely have reservations and appointments in place based on research before traveling somewhere. 

Best advice I can give to anybody is to be nice. It doesn't matter where you are from, just be nice. This applies to anywhere you are in life. Finally, know how to say hello, please, thank you, I'm sorry, excuse me.. it will get you very far. Sooo, be nice and have manners :)

\--

Day 1 (23,282 steps) 

Arrived at CDG and took the metro into town. Got off at the Saint Michel stop and walked to our hotel in Marais. We were able to do an early check-in so we dropped off our things, changed and spent several hours walking around Marais before our dinner reservation. Loved the energy of the neighborhood. Had cocktails at Bar Noveau and Le Marie Celeste, both of which were two of our favorites on the trip. The staff at BN were amazing. Finally we closed out the evening eating at Cafe des Musees with their famous Boeuf Bourguignon. Overall nice meal, but nothing we had blew either of us away.

\--

Day 2 (32,438 steps)

Early rise to walk to Marche Couvert des Enfants Rouges. We went to the Butcher of Paris and had an awesome charcuterie board for breakfast. We had some time to kill before lunch at Les Enfants du Marche in the market so we walked around until they opened. Pro tip: get there \~15 minutes before they open at noon as it fills up FAST. We sat down and within moments, the place was full with a line of 20-30 queued up. This place is indeed, worth all the hype. While in the market try some of the other foods, snacks, juices, coffees, oysters, urchin, art, flowers, etc.. There's a lot to see and enjoy there. 

After our awesome breakfast/lunch we walked to some of the covered markets in the 1st and 2nd and eventually made our way north towards Pigalle and Montmatre. Along the way we stopped for some wine at One and One, and met a shop owner/artist who educated us on a local street artist, Invader, and his influence on the city since the 80's. For strangers to the artist and his work, it's worth a Google search. There's also an app you can download and play while you are walking around the city.. I'll just leave it at that. 

In Pigalle we stopped for drinks at Classique. The drinks were mostly wine-based spins on classic cocktails, among other offerings. We then made our way to Montmatre and visited Sacre Coeur. We lined up and waited roughly 30 minutes before getting in. Beautiful building both outside and in, but I was eager to leave pretty quickly as there was a service going on. The area around SC was by far the most scammy/dicey area we were in for the entirety of trip. 

We spent the remaining time before dinner walking around the hilled neighborhood, visiting small shops and taking in the beautiful day. Dinner was at Le Bistrot du Maquis. I was determined to have pressed duck on this trip and this is the place that delivered. One of my favorite meals in France. 

Pro tip, you have to order the duck at least two days in advance as he has to go to the country to pick it up for you. It's truly indescribable how amazing this dish(s) was. We were exhausted and many lbs heavier after dinner so we opted to take a taxi back. Note: we used the G7 app several times with great success.

\--

Day 3 (27,962 steps)

Early rise to head to a nearby boulangerie for coffee and a couple of pastries. We took our slow stroll towards the Seine and crossed over to walk along the south part of the river towards St. Germain in the 6th and 7th. We were around the Invalides and then crossed the Alexandre III bridge towards the Place de la Concorde. Walked around there, and around the Grand and Petit Palais before lunch at Le Gabriel. Lunch was about as amazing as expected and this is a restaurant we'd both come back to for dinner service and a fuller experience. We talked to the manager for some time and he gave us a huge list of his favorite places to eat around town. After lunch we hung in Marigny Square to change shoes and catch our breath. 

We then made our way towards St. Germain and stopped for drinks at Maison Sauvage. We began talking to some French and American folks nearby to which we completely lost track of time due to our imbibing and chattering when we realized it was nearly an hour from our dinner reservation across town. The original plan for the afternoon and evening was to be around the Arc area, but that clearly fell through. We took a taxi to our destination at Restaurant Pages. This was one of the top 3 meals we had in Paris. Cannot stress enough the talent and creativity of the chef and the meal they put together. Once again, we were exhausted, stuffed, and opted to take a taxi back to our hotel.

\--

Day 4 (36,151 steps) 

Another early start that began with a new boulangerie for coffee and pastries. We made our way to Cimeti√®re du P√®re-Lachaise in the 11th and slowly strolled along the grounds. While I get that cemeteries are not for everyone, I personally love them. I could have easily spent an entire day in there getting lost. We did visit a lot of tombs of famous artists, writers, and musicians. 

We then made our way to Bistrot Paul Bert for lunch to partake in their famous steak frites. While the au poivre steak was delicious, we had better later on in the trip. To note, it was nearly impossible to call in a reservation here. When I finally reached someone, they took down our info but when we showed up there was no record of it. They were able to sit us without issue so I think if you can't reach someone by phone, just showing up at their lunch opening shouldn't be an issue to get a table. 

After lunch we walked around the 11th and eventually got on the Paris Highline. We took in the beautiful foliage and eventually made our way towards the Jardid des Plantes and eventually to the Catacombs. We booked a late tour and while fascinating and learning a lot, we were a little exhausted by the end due to the massive crowds in the tight spaces. Yes, I do think it's worth seeing once. 

We had a few hours to burn before dinner so we made our way towards Montparnasse and walked around the 14th. We did some shopping along Rue Daguerre where we bought some gourmet food to bring back. We then stopped for some spritzes before heading to dinner. In spite of the horrendous black rectangle building that has no place anywhere in Paris, Montparnasse was our favorite neighborhood. 

We walked through the Jardin du Luxembourg (I wish we had spent more time here) to the Latin Quarter where our dinner at Alliance was. While there were a lot of highlights during the meal, there was a lot that was left to be desired. Service was way off as the timing with wine pours and dish delivery were discombobulated. One of our wine descriptions was ""This is a white wine from X, it is dry."" After dinner, we took a late night walk back to our hotel taking in the vibrant energy and beauty of the city at night.

\--

Day 5 (25,143 steps)

Headed out early again with pastry and coffee in hand towards Ile de la Cite and the Ile Saint-Louis. We had 9am reservations to St Chapelle and we arrived 10 minutes early to an insane queue along the street. Once they opened, it took about 20 minutes to get in. Stunning gothic structure with some truly breathtaking stone and stained-glass work. Definitely worth seeing but we weren't there longer than 20 minutes. We spent about an hour walking around the Concierge and Notre Dame until crowds started getting crazy and we decided to move along to the Latin Quarter. 

We walked around for a while before lunch, exploring the neighborhoods, shops, and University areas. Lunch was at Hestia, which was a very nice meal with an amazing wine list. We decided to take a beat for the rest of the afternoon before a fancy dinner so we slowly made our way back to our hotel, but not without stopping for ice cream and sorbet from Berthillon along the way. We recharged and headed to dinner at L'Ambroisie in the Place des Vosges. 

If you are going to do one fine-dining dinner in Paris, this should be at or near the top of the list. It was easily our favorite dining experience in Paris, and one of my favorite ever. It's as classic French restaurant (not a tasting), that has several dishes that have been on the menu for 35+ years. By the end, we were bursting at the seams and asked to pass on the dessert. That apparently wasn't acceptable as they brought us each their famous chocolate tart to indulge in as it was a must try. They were right, it was. The ambiance is quintessentially classic. Service was warm and flawless, and one of our servers had been there for 30+ years. On our way out, he introduced us to his granddaughter who was working her first night. This was really a special night. 

\--

Day 6 (37,660 steps)

We woke up still full from the night before so we skipped the boulangerie and headed over to the Louvre. We had tickets for 9am and used the Carrousel du Louvre mall entrance. We arrived to another massive queue (I seriously think people start lining up hours before opening times to everything). When the line started moving we got in pretty quick. We walked along the ""walls"" and made our way to a lot of the ancient works on the -1 and 0 floors. I'm convinced everyone in line had the same idea, ""run to the Mona Lisa to get there before everyone else."" Well that's simply nonsense, but it was to our great fortune that because of this, many of the ancient civilization pieces were devoid of any crowds! 

We felt like, and usually were the only people in the rooms. We spent around 10 minutes walking around the Venus de Milo before anyone else showed up! After some time there, we finally made our way to the 1st floor where the madness took over. We saw a lot of the key pieces (and many others) by artists we love. We popped into the Mona Lisa room and quickly left because of the crowds. In total, we spend around 3 hours there. If you are an art or history lover you could easily spend weeks or months discovering all the wonders the Louvre offers. 

We were tight on time and zipped over to our lunch reservation at Le Clarence. Lovely lunch and a lot of creative dishes from chef Pele. Like Le Gabriel, we'd love to come back here for dinner for a fuller experience. 

After lunch we made our way to the Tuileries Garden and spent some time watching the ducks and people. We realized we had some time before a night reservation at d'Orsay and a late dinner so we decided to walk to the Arc via the Champs-√âlys√©es and then down to d'Orsay. Nothing of note along the route, just a lot of touristy mall stores and restaurants. Made our ascent to the top or the Arc and enjoyed the city view from all angles. 

We were a bit constrained on time so we took the metro to the museum. Absolutely loved d'Orsay. The setting is so unique and beautiful. They were showcasing a Krohg exhibit and a French Street art exhibit, both of which were great in their own right. 

We concluded our evening with a walk to Alleno for dinner. Amazing meal with some of the most meticulous staff-to-diner care and interaction I have ever experienced. The meal took close to 4 hours so we cabbed it back to the hotel again. This was by far our most packed day and I'd likely break up the museum visits into different days. 

\--

Day 7 (26,864 steps).

This was originally intended to be a day-trip to Lyon but we decided to squash that and do an open-ended unplanned day in the City instead. FWIW, I think it would have been total overkill to follow through with the Lyon plan. We slept in a little (thank god) and made our way towards the 11th for lunch at Clamato. Lunch was ok for the most part but unfortunately, a lot of the warm dishes came out cold. Oysters and wine were excellent however. Great atmosphere that I'm sure would be way more vibrant and exciting at night. 

We then worked our way back to Marais and Les Halles with the intention to do some shopping. On the way, I stopped to get a sandwich from Chez Aline, which was ridiculously delicious and put together by one of the nicest people in Paris. We also did a quick pitstop at Les Halles Station to get tickets to Champagne for our trip the following day. We then stopped at Danico for some amazing cocktails and a Neopolitan Pizza. From our shopping along the way, we accumulated various wines, chocolates, mustards, salts, pates, foie gras and other fancy foods from many different shops. Tip (maybe?): we were able to bring back the meat products without issue because they were properly sealed, labeled, and were in small containers. 

As someone who loves to cook, I had my kid in a candy shop moment visiting E. DEHILLERIN. To my wife and wallet's delight, I skipped purchasing my own duck press and only walked out of there with a few pans and some utensils and molds. Afterwards, we decided to hunker down at Le Nelson's across the street to have some drinks while watching all the interesting people pass by. We then made our way back to the hotel to drop off our goodies and decided to do the most touristy thing of the trip, go back up to the Arc to see the Eiffel Tower do its sparkly light show. 

We metro'd to the Tower (this was the first and last time we'd be in the area), took a few photos and then walked over to the Arc. We took the stairs to the top again and waited for the show. As bleh as I initially felt about the whole thing, it was pretty cool to see. Maybe a bit intense for people prone to seizures if they are near the tower, but really cool nonetheless. After the few minutes spent watching the show we shimmied our way back down the stairs and realized we were starving. 

We opted to take a metro to Place Vendome and had dinner at Le Petit Vendome. We narrowly made it before they closed the kitchen but they were more than happy to serve us regardless. This area was so wildly busy and it was awesome watching the energy of the people. LPV is were we had an amazing steak au poivre. They were also able to make us two sandwiches to-go on our way out which we would have for breakfast the next day on the train. We metro'd back to the hotel and crashed hard.

\--

Day 8 (28,207 steps)

Early rise to take the metro to Gare de l'Est for the train to Epernay for my partner's ""Champagne Day."" Our first stop in Epernay was a tasting at Chateau Comtesse Lafonde, a very small vintner with beautiful grounds. We enjoyed everything and bought a bottle. Next stop was for a cellar train tour at one of the big-7 Champagne houses, Mercier. As hokey as it felt at times, our guide was so incredibly good at her job that we loved it. The tasting at the end was very impressive and we ended up walking away with a 2003 vintage. 

Next stop was lunch across the street at Bulles & Bonheur. Great 3-course prix fixe meal. We sampled some of their Champagnes but nothing stood out. Following lunch we took a quick stroll through town with a pit stop at Perrier-Jouet. We had a few glasses and were blown away by everything we tasted. This of course, resulted in the purchase of another vintage. 

We strolled through town and made our way back to the station to head to Reims. First stop in Reims was Charles de Cazanove for a tasting. Unfortunately, this one was a flop for us. We moved along and explored the town and visited Notre Dame. The cathedral was incredibly impressive both inside and out and there were hardly any people in or around it. We then got some chocolates and sweet treats from a couple of shops and some Chaource and Langres cheeses from another. 

Because we were limited when we could buy our return ticket the day before (10:30pm), we didn't have dinner plans. Everything was very full and we ended up at Gueuleton Reims, which also had a little bit of a wait. I hate to talk shit, but this was the only bad meal we had on the trip. Everything, including the bread was generally bad. Nonetheless, our options were limited so we ate what we had and headed to the station for our late train. 

This is where things took a turn. We show up, and everything is locked up. In a panic, we try to circle the building but nothing. A group of older French ladies noticed our distress and offered to help. They looked over our tickets and noticed the tickets were for the following night. What a disaster, and an embarrassing one at that! We walked to the nearest hotel looking for a room and the gentleman at the desk said everything was fully booked and likely would be the same for all the hotels in town. More panic sets in and I begin to scramble to see if we can find something on Airbnb. After some time, someone approved us and thankfully, we had somewhere to stay. 

All the while, to our surprise, the gentleman at the desk had been calling hotels in town to see if they had any openings. Shortly after we booked the Airbnb he said he would be able to get us a room at one of their sister hotels nearby. We were very thankful but stuck to what we found. Fortunately, the apartment was very close so we walked there and crashed immediately. This was a first for us on our travels. We've never overlooked something so obvious as a wrong date of something. Alas, live and learn, and on we march.

\--

Day 9 (24,609 steps)

We wake up as early as possible to catch the first train back to Paris. No problem with these tickets! We got back close to 8:20 and to our delight, we popped out of the metro right in the middle of the Marche Bastille. We quickly drop off our stuff and return to the market. Once again here I was, the kid in a candy shop. We bought some more wines, honey, more mustard and my partner got a dress and a ring and we shared a galette. This is was such a pleasant surprise and I'm not so sure we would have experienced it had it not been for our train scheduling blunder. 

We hiked it up near the Canal St. Martin for our last reservation of the trip at Amalia. This was a great finisher for lunch. Our som here was the biggest standout as he paired our dishes with some really unique wines, and we got some bonus pours because we probably, ask too many questions. 

After lunch, we make our way back to the hotel to pack for our departure at 3am the next day/night. We pack most things and my wife takes a power nap while I head out to pick up butter and cheese from the Marche Enfant Rouges. Cannot recommend enough La Petite Ferme d'Ines (Fromagerie 39) for some exceptional dairy products and some really wonderful people. Pro tip: they can vacuum seal your stuff for easy transport. I then grabbed some ham and a hunk of terrine from the Butcher and some pastries and a baguette for sandwiches and snacks for dinner. 

I make my way back, my partner is awake, and we have a mini picnic on the bed before heading back out. We take the metro to Roland Garros to watch the day-1 night session. After an incredible match, we metro back to the hotel and finish our packing and have our 2nd picnic-dinner before our departure.

\--

Day 10

We don't sleep, because we wouldn't have woken up if we did. Because we now had two extra bags full of wines and treats to bring back, I scheduled a car with the Blacklane app to pick us up at 3am. I would highly advise against this as you can easily get a taxi (many of which were available at the time) for half the price. 

Our driver was 30 minutes late, didn't utter a single word, and drove like a maniac the entire time. I will also close out with Air Canada is the worst airline we've ever used. During our way in they managed to put both of us on standby even though we bought our tickets 6 months in advance, and they lost our luggage on the way home. The service ranged from disinterested to flat out rude across their agents and flight crews. Big fat thumbs down for everything Air Canada.

\--

So there it is. If you've managed to get this far without gouging your eyes out, congrats, and thanks!! Overall this was a wonderful trip. We loved the city vibe, there is a simultaneous grit and refinement to the people and culture that really hit home to my time in NYC. The food and wine are absolutely some of the best in the world (obviously). I honestly think I'd need at least a year of living here and eating out every day to really understand everything Paris has to offer. We can't wait to return.

Happy to answer any questions anyone has. Thanks for reading!

Location: Missouri 

I lived in the same unit for six years. It was noted upon move in that the carpet was not new and had a patch from the previous tenants cat.

I moved out earlier this month and I'm being billed for at least 7 year old carpet for ""pet odor."" I shampooed the carpet and vacuumed regularly as I did have a dog and a cat the entirety of my lease. The carpet was obviously old and stretched. At one point my vacuumed caught a fray near the door and pulled it up because it wasnt tacked down well.

There was darkening between where my sofa and coffee table was. So they pulled the carpet up and it was obviously old, but I find it hard to believe I should have to pay for at least 7 year old carpet. What are everyone's thoughts? 

My bill was $343 dollars and they have already cashed in on a $1000 bond from my pet fees. Is 7 year old carpet worth $1400? Or even the $343 that they billed to me?",0,1748623727.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False

Ice Breakers. The moment I taste one, sharp and cold on my tongue, it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs next to me again. That crisp sweetness, like the way he kisses me mid-sentence, like the way he smells when he leans in too close. I swear, they taste like him, bright, cool, unforgettable. And just like him, they stay with me long after they‚Äôre gone.

Shoes make me think of him too, which is stupid unless you knew that he once tied mine so tight I swore he was trying to keep me tethered to him. Maybe he was. Or maybe he was trying to keep me grounded. It‚Äôs funny because he‚Äôs an electrician so maybe that‚Äôs what he was doing. Keeping me grounded to him. I didn‚Äôt untie them for hours. They left a mark, but so did he.

Then there‚Äôs his guitar. God, the way he plays. Like the strings owe him something. Like the music is trying to confess what words can‚Äôt. Sometimes I listen just to hear his soul bleeding out through those chords. And every time, it hits me how lucky I am to know a boy who sings with his hands.

His eyes are blue. Not dark blue, not storm blue, but glacier blue. They‚Äôve wrecked me gently a hundred times over. The color blue will forever be imprinted into my brain. I will never look at that color the same again. 


The stars remind me of him. The moon too. He said he loves space. The mysteries behind it. Now I think of him every time I look up. I take every falling star I see as a sign that he‚Äôs the one for me. 


The smell of coffee hits me like a freight train. Not just because he drinks it. But because he uses those coffee-flavored nicotine pouches, and the scent clings to his clothes and settles in my lungs like a second heartbeat. Now coffee doesn‚Äôt just wake me up. It makes me ache for him.


And pink flowers. God, don‚Äôt get me started on pink flowers. He picked one once. And I don‚Äôt mean just one tiny flower. I mean the one whole plant. Ripped the whole thing right from the garden box outside of an Outback Steakhouse on our first date, flowers, roots and soil. He put it in a can so it wouldn‚Äôt get dirt in my car on my way home. I still have it. I treat it like it‚Äôs a diamond. 
I still press that moment in the pages of my memory like it‚Äôll die if I let it breathe.


All of this, mints, shoes, guitars, colors, stars, flowers‚Ä¶ none of it means anything on its own. But together? They form this soft mosaic of love I can‚Äôt ever explain. Saying ‚ÄúI love him‚Äù feels like such a lie. It‚Äôs too small, too shallow.

I don‚Äôt love him. I exist because of him. I inhale reminders of him like oxygen. I carry him in every sense, every breath, every beat. Love is just the beginning.

He‚Äôs the reason even ice-cold mints feel like warmth.

1kz8zbu,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1kz8zbu/one_month_of_if_10_pounds_down/,"One month of IF, 10 pounds down!","5‚Äô5‚Äù F, SW 200.8 CW 190.5 GW 165

I do 18:6 fasting most days with an occasional 20:4. I try to eat between 1,200-1,400 calories daily and hit my goal maybe 80% of the time, sometimes going over. 

I don‚Äôt have any off limits foods, but have begun using my kitchen scale to weigh out food to track calories accurately. Portion control has been the biggest change for me. I make less pasta now than I used to and try to have a meat/protein based dinner like baked chicken, steak tacos, or lentils.  I cut sugar and half and half from my morning coffee. Picked up Coke Zero for my sugar cravings. Drink a minimum of 32 ox of ware daily with half an LMNT packet. I usually get that to 64 oz but I‚Äôm not strict about it.  I love fruit and eat a few peaches/cup of cherries/loads of strawberries daily. I tried keto before but missed fruit too much, so I‚Äôve decided to keep them. My body feels best fueled partially by carbs. 

I break my fast with a tinned fish snack plate with fruit, picked veg, bread, and citrus.it changes daily depending on what kind of fish I have and what produce is around, but typically I have some kind of sardines, mackerel or kipper snacks.  I have found that intense flavors/high fat but smaller portions are more satisfying to me and take longer to eat than say a turkey sandwich. I have really come to love my tinned fish lunch and dont foresee giving that up any time soon. 

My only exercise this month was walking, averaged 6,000 steps a day and my goal this next month is to get that up to an average or 8,000.  I also plan to add 50 squats per day, we‚Äôre starting from zero, so taking it slow and easy. I just do ten squats an hour for the first few hours of my day. 

I don‚Äôt weigh daily. I try to weigh twice a week. If I don‚Äôt feel like it I don‚Äôt weigh. I don‚Äôt even bother weighing myself when my pre-period bloat starts, I wait until at least day 3 of menstruating to get my weight. 

Looking forward to what next month will bring! My goal is to be at 165 by Christmas, and my ultimate goal is to maintain that weight and fit into my wedding dress I purchased at that weight for my wedding next June. I used to have a very active job and then quickly transitioned to a deck job so lost a lot of strength and gained a ton of fat because I didn‚Äôt change my eating habits. Now it‚Äôs time to get serious about my health and get back to where I feel my best! ",23,1748623322.0,intermittentfasting,1,0.96,False
1kz8z0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kz8z0v/my_18m_girlfriend_18f_of_15_months_sleeps_in_the/,My (18M) Girlfriend (18F) of 15 months sleeps in the same bed as her best friend (19F).,"For context me and my girlfriend, (let's call her W) have been in a healthy relationship for a bit over a year. We are at a point where we are getting ready to move into our own place and get ready to get married. Right now we each live with our parents and I have a stable job and she is attending a college. Like all relationships we have had our ups and downs, but we have always had decent communication and worked through it all together. She is openly bisexual and this is something I am okay with since we agreed that we want to be a closed relationship.

We went through a bit of a rough patch this past January and she came clean that she was having emotional attractions to her best friend, (let's call her N). N lives in an apartment in a city about 30 minutes from me and W. This apartment isn't small either, multiple bedrooms and bathrooms type of large. Well it isn't uncommon for W to go and hang out with N at her house as they are best friends and there is simply a lot more to do in N's town then ours. We'll throughout our relationship W has stayed the night at N's apartment atleast once a week, sometimes twice or even three times. There has been instances where me and W have rescheduled our plans because she was up all night at N's house and is tired, or even still at N's house and they have more plans they want to do that day. I never really had a major issue with it and to me it kinda was just ""a thing girls do"" I guess. I thought it was normal for 2 girl best friends to sleep in the same bed. Both of them are bisexual so after W confessed that she was having attraction to N I have always had a nagging part of my brain that has made me uncomfortable about the situation. W said that she loved me and that wasn't changing and I had nothing to worry about. ""I'm not going to break up with you for the chance to be with N"" was something she would say often. I still felt weird about it, but I love W and I trusted her. So I held my tongue. W was adamant that she didn't want to pick between me and N and she wasn't going to leave me. But part of me still felt weird about it.

Well N has a job in our town. Me and W often go to eat lunch or coffee at the place where N was working. We would go at least once a week and some days I would leave and W would stay till they closed and then go back with N back to her apartment where they would hang out and stay the night. Or even N would go back to W's house and sleep there since it was a closer drive.

Fast forward to a month ago where I said something that made N upset due to a circumstance that she was in, that i will not be elaborating on, that i had no clue about and she claimed that she didn't want me anywhere near her and that I couldn't come back into the coffee shop. I respected her decision and after learning of her situation I called to apologize and make it known that I mean no offense by anything I said. I still respect her boundaries and dont go to the coffee shop anymore. However W claimed that N over reacted but that she (W) doesn't want go pick between us. W still goes to the coffee shop and stays the night with N.

Part of me still feels as if she did pick, but me and N have made up and I am over it.

Well fast forward to a couple weeks ago N got a new job working at the same place that W works at and the sleepovers have gotten much more frequent. Which I kind of expected as W's parents have a spare bedroom that they offered to N on their own so she doesn't have to drive 30 minutes to an hour at midnight or later. But that's just the thing, they offered her a completely separate room and yet her and W still sleep in the same small bed together.

I don't know if maybe I am just paranoid from where I have been cheated on in past relationships or if me being uncomfortable about this is justified. Or maybe I am over reacting completely and this is a normal thing and I am missing something, I dont know. I just want advise on how to talk to W and either establish a boundary or what I should do?",1,1748623300.0,relationship_advice,3,0.67,False

Must be willing to relocate.   
Attention to detail is a must (always checking lists twice).   
Must like milk and cookies.   
Send resume to sclause@northpole.com.

It looked like a joke, but she sent off her resume‚Äîand now here she was at the North Pole, working as an executive assistant to Santa Claus himself.

She sat down at her desk and started going through today‚Äôs list. In the distance, she heard the elves singing carols as they went about their work. They were so damn cheery all the time. It was obnoxious. Who was this happy before coffee? It was amazing how even the magic of the North Pole eventually turned into just another place to work. But Mr. Claus was a very kind boss, and Mrs. Claus was always dropping by with treats, so overall, it was a pretty sweet gig.

‚ÄúWell, Jeremy, you haven‚Äôt been very nice this year,‚Äù Heather muttered as she added his name to the naughty list. She was just pulling up the next file when she noticed the elves were being unusually quiet outside. There was no singing, no laughter, no random snowball fights.

She walked over to the window and peered outside. The elves had all stopped to look at something. She opened the door and stepped out.

Standing all around the village was a group of penguins. They all seemed to be looking down at the elves. Then, all at once, they jumped onto their bellies and started sliding down the hills into the village.

And that‚Äôs when the screaming started.

The penguins began violently pecking at the elves. Heather watched in horror as the flightless birds started ripping the fallen elves to pieces. She ran out into the snow, punching and kicking, sending penguins flying as she went.

‚ÄúFollow me!‚Äù she cried out to the elves. A few of them fell in behind her as she worked her way toward one of the snowplows they kept on hand.

The elves, inspired by Heather‚Äôs bravery in the face of such danger, were overtaken with courage. ‚ÄúProtect the toys!‚Äù she heard a high but mighty voice yell out.

Around her was utter chaos as the blood of penguins and elves splattered across the white snow. She hustled the elves into the snowplow.

‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt come back, I want you to take off in this thing and go as far as you can!‚Äù she yelled at the cowering elves.

She turned and started heading toward the Clauses‚Äô house. She had to get them out of here.

A storm had started howling. Heather could barely see as she pushed forward through the carnage of feathers, blood, and snow swirling around her. She finally reached the house to find Mrs. Claus cowering. Santa wasn‚Äôt there‚Äîhe must be in his workshop.

Heather took Mrs. Claus by the hand and pulled her out of the house.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not safe here!‚Äù she yelled.

As they started toward Santa‚Äôs workshop, the blizzard raged in front of them. Heather turned around‚Äîand they were completely surrounded by penguins. There was nowhere to run.

The birds swarmed over them, pecking and clawing. Heather could feel her flesh being ripped apart. She looked over at Mrs. Claus.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù she whispered.

The world went black.

What would happen to Christmas now?

I am devasted. Is there a way to bring her back and reconcile?,"I am in desperate need of advice or any way that could help me get back with my girlfriend of 1 and half year. 

She left me a week ago and I don't know what to do. 
Before you call me out, I take all the accountability for what I did and I am ashamed. I hid my cheating and was sure she doesn't know about it until she confeonted me almost a year later. I know what I did is indispicable and I am willing to fix it, but her turing on me like that really hurt me. And I know I deserved it, but still I want to make things right. I'll tell you exactly what happened so you know the full story behind this. 

I  met my girlfriend  when I was on vacation at my home country since I work in another country as a constrution site manager. We met at the club and I immediately fell for her. She is a blonde with gorgeous body, educated and was running her own cosmetics business. 

We did a long distance for six months before she moved into my place in another country. She got the work visa because we were not married and she had to renew it every couple of months. 

During that time, while we were in a long distance I felt incredibly insecure. She was so pretty and guys probably hit on her all the time. And I am short and overweight guy who was scared she woild never even look at my direction let alone date me. 
I let my fear of her cheating on me probably, take over me. And I took the advice of my friends that I should just relax and hook up with someone else, she wouldn't find out. And beside that I would prove to myself that I can have better women, and that she will most probably cheat on me sooner or later cause my friends gave me reasons why she as a attractive woman would not be so faithful. 

So I did it. It was with a woman from a different town in my country so she couldn't possibly find out about it. I felt guilty afterwards. I knew I made a mistke and prayed that she wouldn't find out because I knew that would break us apart. My friend group convinced me that all men do it and it is impossible for her to find out about it. 

So I managed to let it go after some time but it would eat me inside. I became more jealous, especially after she moved to my place. I was much more paranoid and scared, but she was clueless all the time and she would always reassure me that things are fine. I was feeling guilty and regretting what I did but I managed to let it go, believing that she wouldn't find out about it and I'll made it up to her somehow. It was a mistake, just a moment of weakness and I loved her so much. I was such an idiot I know. 

Six months after she moved in and moved her business with her, I started looking into engagments rings and planning proposal. While I was at the store trying to pick the ring I got a call by my friend. He wanted to meet me immediately. 

I went to the caffee  and met him there. He told me that he just saw my girlfriend getting into a Lambo of some guy. I was in a complete disbelief. I questioned him more, and he explained that he was about to get out of the coffee when he saw her getting into the car. He would've taken photos but he didn't have time to do that, they sped off immediately as in some hurry. 

I immediately called my girlfriend to check without telling her what is the reason why I wanna know and she told me she was with her best friend, a girl who she met when she moved here. She was a manager in real estate company and they immediately clicked. I pressed for proofs and she sent me pictures and videos of her and her best friend which put my mind to ease. I told my friend that he probably made a mistake, I wanted to believe he did. 

Days went by and my girlfriend started spending more time with her friend. Everytime I would ask she would send me pictures or videos. Sometimes even without me asking. Which made me trust her but something was telling me that there is something off. She became distant, saying she is also stressed and bussy with work. 
What made me suspicious was when she started refusing intimacy, always having some excuse. 

One day she came home with an expensive bracelet and she claimed that her best friend gifted that to her. I let it slide because her best friend was making a lot of money and my girlfriend could not afford that type of bracelet. 

I would iniciate intimicay but she would again refuse, or when I finally got her to sleep with me she seemed diaconncted like she just wanted it to be over with. 

That pushed me to start digging more. I told my friends about it and they said she might be cheating. All the time everyone forgot about what I did in the first place. I was sure she didn't know about my cheating and in that case she showed who she really was. I thought if she doesn't know then my friends were right. I was completely blind to my own sins and just angry at her, without considering the fact that I did deserve it. 

One night while she was sleeping, her phone lit up with notification. I had to snoop. I found a chat with some guy, who was memorised in her phone under a ninja emoji. I went through their messages and realized that was the guy. They coordinated meetings and everytime she said she was with her friend she was with him. He brought that bracelet. She also told him how she doesn't have the country's citizenship and if she breaks up with me she will have to stay on her own without a house or anything which would make her move back to her country and that would be bad for the business that started thriving here. Also some of the messages between them were deleted and she never adressed him with his name. 

I went through her photos and found out that those photos with her friend were all premeditated. I found their chat and she knew about the affair and she covered it up. What struck me as odd was the fact that messages with her best friend mentioning the guy's name and other details were deleted cause some streaks just didn't make sense and It was obvious they were sharing details related to him. 

I was furious, and I completely forgot what I did to her I was convinced she doesn't know about it. I took pictures of everything and met up with my guys the next day showing them everything. They advised me to make a plan and then confront her cause she has been hiding this for 4 months and she could easily manipulate and gaslight me. 

Next thing I did is I went to her friend. I am not proud of it but I made the whole scene, screaming  and threatening her which caused her to open up. I was so furious about everything that I couldn't control myself.  She told me the guy is her boss before her sister heard us and started calling the cops. I run away and went straight to my house. 

One hour later, while I was waiting for my girlfriend to come back from work one of my friends who was completely unaware of the situation started blowing up my phone with messages. 
He saw my girlfriend and her affair partner at one caffee. He wanted to check are we still together, cause she pretended she doesn't recognize him. And he sent me photos and videos. Both of them laughing at each others jokes, him kissing her hand. Like they are without care in the world. 

And the guy was tall, muscular, shaven and in a suite. You could see he has a lot of money and I could not compare. For the first time in years I started sobbing. How could she do this? She replaced me so easily, everyone was right.  While I was looking at proposal rings she was screwing the Mr. Rich Handsome guy. 

I gathered myself and briefly told my friend what is going on and asked him does he know who is the guy. He said no but it seems like he is the common customer here since he was very talkative with the bartender. So my friend, returned to the caffe and made up some story asking the bartender about the guy. And man spilled out  a lot. His name, his company name. He was 25, younger that me and owned two real estate companies. He did not inherit them, he founded them, at such age. Meanwhile I moved from my parents house here, and still can't fulfill my dreams. 

I felt completely inadequate. I waited for my girlfriend to come home and she was obviously late cause she was screwing him and I confornted her immediately. She went to give me a kiss but I blatantly asked her ""Who is (the guys name)""? 

She froze and I poured out everything about how it made me feel, how could she do that she just watched me and calmly sat down, taking the lighter to light her cigarette. The she finally spoke ""You weren't crying and throwing up when you fucked the fat bitch"" 

And I realized she knew. Then she explained that she accidentally found out one night while I was in the shower. Something told her to go through my phone and she did. Then she showed me the picture of a girl and laughed out loud. The girl wasn't even half as good looking as her and she knew that. And I knew that. 

I tried to explain, but she cut me off by saying she is moving out tonight. And she went to pack her bags. While she packed we argued more and she said her and that guy started as friends after her best friend introduced him to her as a good business connecting but soon it grew into something else. She even stabbed me more by saying she knew what I did before she got with this guy and she was planning on leaving me when she has enough money but then this guy came along. 

She said she loved him truly. He was what she wanted, her dream guy. I begged her to work things out with me but she packed the bags and called him to pick her up. Not my proudest moment but I got outside to confront him and ended up punched. 

It's been a week since she moved out. She has blocked me on everything and I can't reach out to her and please I need help. If it's even possible to get her back, I'll do whatever I can. I know I messed up big time but is there any possible way to win her back and to fix things? ",0,1748622870.0,relationship_advice,7,0.4,False
1kz8qi8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kz8qi8,I made signature dishes for the season 1 characters.,"Im not an artist , so fan art is a bit beyond my skills, but i did make signature food items for the infinight crew in they same style of if they had a signature sandwich at my fantasy sandwich shop, and after some testing of the recipes , im ready to share: 

Mudd: spicy fried green tomatoes, arugula (rocket for the not americans), garlic aoli, vinegar, Italian seasoning, and pickled onions on an sub roll. 

IDK why but I wanted Mudd to have a vegetarian sandwich and for it to be earthy with the arugula to reflect the dirt in coffee.  Iff making this at home I'd recommend adding cheese , which i forgot to. 

Kyborg: extra crispy buffalo fried chicken sandwich  with  jalape√±o bacon, onion, jalape√±os, avocado,  a little bit of a spicy ranch and  2 slices of aged cheddar . 

Kyborg would want a spicy signature food, but I dont think he can handle it so this sandwich looks and sounds spicy but really isn't. Chicken is cooked a little darker as it has cornmeal in the batter for extra crispy bits.


Bart: (this is my favorite) homemade uncrustable stuffed with brie cheese, caramelized onion, and pancetta, toasted in a pan , and I ate 3. 

Bart's whole thing of being small but full of surprises and utility , along with a whole lot of charm. This whole sandwich is ""good things come in small packages. Yes I bought an uncrustables press to make this, no i dont regret it. 

Gum Gum: Gum Gum didn't get the memo to pick a sandwich so his signature dish is a smores cupcake , with a suprise blueberry compote filling, topped with graham cracker crumbs.  

Dark chocolate cake with a marshmallow fluffy frosting on top with a hidden pocket of wild blueberries to mimic wild magic.  I think Gum Gum has a massive sweet tooth so its appropriate.

I usually don't pursue anything at work but I felt I would regret it. She checked off some of my boxes, Good sense of humor, witty, hardworking, kind etc. She had a boyfriend but at some point they broke up and I didn't know until she mentioned she had a date. I tried slow playing for a little bit but I didn't want to wait too long since apps give a lot of options. I asked her to get coffee and she said that would be nice but wanted to wait until after the holidays because her schedule was packed. I said sure, I was just relieved that I got it off my chest.

Then came the longest month ever. I felt ok waiting but I would be lying if I said I wasn't skeptical . I decided I would not bring up the date until we cleared the holidays and continued work as usual.

After she got back from PTO I noticed that she was tense around me, as if she was worried that I would ask about the date. I got the sense something was up. As much as I wanted to talk to her about what's up I decided to just wait till after the holidays as planned. Didn't want to turn the holidays sour. I was really hoping she would take the initiative though and bring it up if there was an issue.

Post holidays I texted her about coffee and she got back to me hours later saying I was a great guy but she wasn't in a good place for a relationship and that she didn't want to complicate things between us at work. I thanked her for her honesty and told her we're good.

Feedback I've gotten

- It's ok. I think you need to find someone who has better communication. She should have told you sooner.

- Just be cool. She might be going through some stuff, especially after a long term relationship. The ball is in her court if she ever changes her mind

- Great you're so considerate of how she feels but you need to think about yourself. She didn't really treat you well in this situation. She probably wanted to say no and hoped you'd give up. I think she has some stuff to work through. Forget about her. You might end up unhappy even if it did happen.

 She always seemed to be straight forward when I worked with her. I was upset but I'm not one to be stand off ish about it. I honestly valued our friendship and work relationship so I put a lot of work into making sure we're cool. I started by setting boundaries for myself, keeping things all work and don't over interact. Gradually that dissolved and we started joking around again. We got to the point where some days I get a gut feeling she is considering trying that date. But she hasn't given me any super clear signals that I feel confident to act on. Not sure if she would out right ask either.

So here's my dilemma, I want to ask if anything has changed. In a perfect world we could have just talked it out before because I really wanted to know if she was just leading me on or she genuinely considered that date. I know that conversation would be LOADED and emotionally charged though. If not for work I would have Distanced myself more.

Asking this because I think I have to just pick a lane and move on from all this. Of course many have told to me to drop it. Others have said there's nothing wrong with getting clarification. I'm just worried its more trouble than its worth and could ruin our current ""peace"" we have. Don't want her to freeze up again, seems like she hates confrontation. Also I'm starting to feel maybe our outside work personalities may not mesh. I'm kinda laid back and she seems to go out a lot. I know I've seen some other quirks that I like and some I'm not sure about. Sorry I'm rusty on the relationship stuff. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses so far! I'll be moving on from this. I think what tripped me up was just imagining someone tell their close friend ""so this person asked me out at work and I said yes but I wanted to say no. So I told them to wait a few weeks cause I had holiday plans and I hope they won't follow up when the time comes"" . To me, that just sounds ridiculous and unnecessary when it could be solved much quicker with an honest text. Someone gonna get hurt no matter what!",0,1748622592.0,AskMenAdvice,57,0.5,False
